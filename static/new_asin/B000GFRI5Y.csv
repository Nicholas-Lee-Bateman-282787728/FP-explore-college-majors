2608090,3,B000GFRI5Y,"POPULATION/436 is a decent thriller, although unfortunately it gives away its secret way too early.  It doesn't take very long at all to understand the secret of Rockwall Falls, a little town whose population has held at 436 for over a century.  A young census taker (Jeremy Sisto) comes to the town to do the latest census and soon he finds out just how strange the townspeople are.  Seems like they'll do anything to make sure there is equilibrium and harmony and that the population always remains 436.

Sisto is good in his role and the movie has that sneaky terror we enjoyed so much in TWILIGHT ZONE and OUTER LIMITS, but since we know pretty much how it will all turn out, there's little suspense.  Limp Bizkit's FRED DURST also has a role as the deputy sheriff in love with the lovely Charlotte Sullivan.",1158019200,,812,4.572413793103448
2608091,4,B000GFRI5Y,"A guy from the census bereau visits the backwoods town of Rockwell Falls ; upon further investigation he realises that the towns population has remained at 436 for the last century.

Curious, he sets out to find out just how this has remained so for so long,in the process he falls for the village beauty who happens to be the love interest of the local Sheriff deputy and jealousy insues.

The town elders now have a problem...he makes 437 and the standard of 436 must remain.

2608115,5,B000GFRI5Y,"If you've looked at census data at any point in your life, if you've ever had to learn any Stat at all, or if you've got a basic understanding of how the census is taken, this is an amazing and hilarious movie.  So we start with a shaky foundation, but it gets much better.  I deeply appreciate the sexy census taker, Limp Bizkit as awkward second fiddle, the bizarre half-plot about numerology, the very casual Lottery ending in a hanging, and lobotomy as public policy.  I'm officially approving this film as a former employee of the US Census Bureau.  I can't believe that RIGHT NOW, it's available used for $0.01.",1412121600,,617,4.581818181818182

2608119,4,B000GFRI5Y,"I really wish this title would come out in bluray.  The storyline is an intersting one, and is suspenseful.  There are a few known names in the movie, and the acting is overall pretty good.

I recommend this movie to anyone interested in suspense/horror.",1366761600,,254,4.7272727272727275

2608121,4,B000GFRI5Y,"Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto), a US Census Bureau researcher, visits a small town named Rochester Falls to check a troubling thing in the population data. Rochester Falls is a very tidy place populated by friendly and nice people - but very soon Kady also finds that this isolated little community has also a very dark secret. Later he finds that this secret is VERY dark indeed...

This little nicely done film is sometimes referred to as a horror movie, but I prefer to consider it a thriller, as the atmosphere of fear is obtained with psychological tricks in the scenario rather than any kind of monster... As one of the previous reviewers already noticed, there is something from ""The wicker man"" in this film (the original one, not the pathetic remake) and I also found some elements from ""Stepford wives"", M. Night Shyamalans ""Village"" and ""Rosemary's baby"".

The general mood reminded me also a little bit of Stephen King's short stories about little towns harboring a deep secret, like Children of the corn"" or ""Rainy season"" - but once again, it is neither a slasher flick nor a horror film with monsters (and no, there is no satanists in it either). Last but not least, in this film it appears that the Big Brother not only watches you but kind of REALLY loves you - in its own very peculiar way... There is only the slightest suspicion of something supernatural in this film, but it is enough to create a quite upsetting atmosphere.

Actors, with the exception of Jeremy Sisto, were mostly unknown to me but they played very well and that includes the youngest of them, Reva Timbers, who plays Amanda, a schizophrenic little girl. The scenario is quite solid and I didn't see any obvious plot holes. The ending is very good (and definitely MUCH better than the alternative one, which you can watch in bonus features) and it gives this film both a nice closure and a sadistic twist...

Bottom line, I liked this film. It is not a great masterpiece, but a solid, honest thriller which we can also interpret as something more than just a thriller... Enjoy!",1348617600,,2061,4.685082872928176
2608122,4,B000GFRI5Y,"This movie was a really pleasant surprise. Great suspense and creepiness. I really like Sisto and he did a better than average job with the role. If you enjoy films like Children of the Corn, and other classic horror films you will like this as it is not a slasher film but more of a suspense horror film.",1326067200,,305,4.275862068965517
2608123,3,B000GFRI5Y,"I didn't expect much when the movie started, but I thought since Jeremy Sisto was in it, and the fact that I had seen some of his other movies, and believe he's a decent actor, I figured Population 436 couldn't be all that bad. And you know what? It wasn't. It played out like a typical Stephen King miniseries. It wasn't heavy on the violence and CGI, which is a good thing because sometimes you just want the script and the actors to carry the movie forward like they're supposed to.

It held my interest that I wanted to see it through to the end. I know that's not saying much but I do believe Population 436 is worth a viewing.",1325203200,,632,4.223140495867769
2608124,3,B000GFRI5Y,"There is nothing really to hate or to love about this movie. It is entertaining. It isn't annoying. The acting is decent. But this isn't one of those movies that completes your life. You won't be disappointed watching it. That's why most reviewers have given it a 3. At most, it's a 4. I didn't like the ending.",1320192000,,311,4.379310344827586
2608125,3,B000GFRI5Y,"Plain and simple this movie is pretty much the wicker man remixed. A man visits a town and finds out something strange is going on. You watch as he unravels the mystery and finds himself wishing he hadn't. If you like movies like the wicker man you'll probably enjoy this film. Actually the film felt like it was slightly above one of those made for TV. Sci-Fi channel films. It's just slightly better than those. The films acting is okay well some actors are better than others but still they don't exactly make me feel like I'm not watching a movie.

The story I didn't have to much of a problem with. I liked the Wickerman and those twilight zone stories. What made me knock off 2 starts for this film is the same reason I knock off stars for other films. The characters make stupid decisions that just ruin the story. I just don't get that the main character feels the need to stop at everyone's house while he is trying to escape. I don't get why he feels the need to inform the towns people that he knows something is going on. For a guy alone in the middle of a place he's not familiar with he certainly has learned to ask all the wrong questions. I guess his Bureau training didn't cover how to keep your mouth shut.

There are just times when your watching and you ask yourself why is he doing all this? Why doesn't he just count the peoples heads accept that there are 436 people in the town,eat some apple pie, get back in his car,drive home to Chicago,THEN tell the people at the office that this town is flippin crazy and call for an investigation. Heck he could make a youtube video about them warning the world it's not like they'd even know.

It's just decisions like that in the movie that make you not find the characters believable. There are some funny scenes in the movie like The ""Good Doctor"" Degrees. I found that to be a real laugh. You expect the ""doctor"" to have real Ph'Ds but all he has are documents where the town said that he was a ""good"" doctor. There's other scenes but they weren't meant to be funny but they ended up being because of the cheesiness.

This film is worth renting you will be entertained. It's just not worth owning.",1284940800,,2166,4.340740740740741
2608126,5,B000GFRI5Y,"The film opens with a car-chase which ends in the death of the
driver attempting to escape.  Then, in a scene reminiscent of
many past horror flicks, a man (Jeremy Sisto, the youth in ""Grand
Canyon"") stops at a gas station to ask for directions (to Rockwood
Falls). Everyone either turns away or becomes unfriendly for some
mysterious reason.  It turns out he is a census-taker, and has
been assigned to go there.  When he finally arrives, he discovers
a strange scene.  Everything is like it was in the early 20th
century and the population has remained at 436 for over 100 years.
This sets up some obvious problems, like what happens when a
baby is born?  Or if someone just dies?  The people seem very
happy on the surface, but you know something troubling or evil
lurks below the surface.  The basis is called Biblical Numerology,
and the people are convinced that staying at 436 is in accord
with God's wishes.  The film develops slowly and the suspense
builds quietly.  Once someone stays on, can they leave?  The
film offers two endings, barely different, but with huge
consequences for the plot.  Both are provocative.  I really
enjoyed this low budget but beautifully photographed film.  It
is more atmospheric than action oriented, be warned, but it
reminded me of films like ""The Stepford Wives"", ""The Wicker Man"",(1974)
and the John Ritter TV movie ""The Colony"".  The recurring theme
is that once you get in, you may not be able to get out.  Very much worth a look.  For me it was a keeper",1270771200,2,1501,4.650190114068441
2608127,3,B000GFRI5Y,"Kind of reminds me of a macabre 'The Lottery' meets Beelzebub. Grossly entertaining. I had only wished they went into more detail about numerology and its complete relevance in the film. The mere bringing a book onto a table and skimming a few pages with numbers and sketches, didn't really cut it. That is because their creativity was there, but that lack of inception and ingenuity, caused major rushing and unwilling careening into more darker areas. Almost candy coating the relevance of the numbers. Which, in essence, as the basis of the entire film from inception. CREATE. You have such a stellar idea for a really FINALLY unique project, don't rush into everything, make things have depth and meaning. The scenes between the Census Worker and the little girl that he, at best, saves from the town, was mindless, non cohesive and lacked any empathy. The trite emotional response by the actors at the table when the beautiful girl asks the Census dude about his wife and his reaction, and thus getting upset, was like a bad take on a method class, HORRID.

I love films like this. I love something that doesn't need excessive blood, and gore and foul language to entice a watcher to really get into a film. It didn't need elaborate sets or any special effects to turn it into yet another atmospheric cookie cutter horror flik. This isn't horror. Its gripping suspense, almost 'The Village' style.

Would have loved to see M. Night at the helm of this, but overall a really good effort.",1268697600,2,1491,4.7528957528957525
2608128,4,B000GFRI5Y,"Jeremy Sisto is an engaging actor who carries this film.  His character's plight--trying to document a small town's population for the U.S. census.  Things get stranger and stranger as he tries to mount what should be an easy task.  And the townspeople are evasive and unhelpful.  Cleverly directed and shot in a scenic community with a secret, Population 436 serves as a nice diversion with a twist ending.  Light on scares, but it manages to successfully keep you guessing as to why Rockwell Falls population never changes...",1268524800,,527,5.011494252873563
2608129,5,B000GFRI5Y,"Everything about this movie is great.  It's even better the second time.  I was very skeptical at first, especially after seeing Fred Durst was in it, but he was excellent and so were the other actors.  This movie is on my top ten favs list.",1257292800,,241,4.311111111111111
2608130,4,B000GFRI5Y,"This was a low key horror film about a US census employee who goes to census a small town (Rockwell Falls), and discovers that its population never changes.  As he struggles to figure out the town folk's bizarre behavior, he falls in love with a local, and befriends a cute sheriff's deputy Bobby.

I really enjoyed this film. It reminded me quite a bit of Wicker Man (secret society, strange rituals, remote village, cyclic ending), but it also had shades of The Village (bizarre conspiracy by the adults to keep whats going on a secret). I thought the film had some great actors; particularly the friendly sheriff who I thought was cute. I was meh about the relationship between the protagonist and the girl it seemed a bit out of the blue and silly.

I would've liked a better explanation of the 'force' that kept the village populace at 436. And man, does the lead character need a better wardrobe. I doubt the census bureau is quite that casual.

Overall, if you like B-movie horror, or horror movies without a lot of gore, this one is for you.",1257033600,,1049,4.5638297872340425
2608131,3,B000GFRI5Y,"This movie was all right for a low budget movie.  The plot was good and some scenes sent a chill down my spine.  It had some goofy moments that, if left out, would have made the movie better and some of the acting had much to be desired, as did some of the dialogue.  The concept was really disturbing to me, however.  I thought it was going to be more predictable than it was but was pleasantly surprised that there was a bit more to the plot than met the eye.  The reason the population has stayed at 436 and how it has stayed at 436 for 100 years was unsettling to me.  The methods of ""curing the fever"" was really creepy and made me think of how mentally ill people were ""cured"" back at the turn of the century.

If you like low budget movies that are still slightly entertaining, this is right up your alley.  It was a good movie to watch once but I probably won't watch it again.  Some scenes were a little too much for me and left a bad taste in my mouth.",1222128000,2,962,4.0476190476190474
2608132,3,B000GFRI5Y,"Though my first impression of this movie was that it was predictable and not very good...I am someone who watches movies over and over and the more I watched it the more it reminded me of Dark Secret of Harvest Home. It gave me the same ""icky"" feeling (which I love!) and I knew that I would want to see it again and again.  I don't do lengthy reviews, just enough to give my opinion and while it is only a 3-star movie, in my opinion, it is worth a look. The acting is good, there is some predictability but the ending might give you a thought or two. I thought the plot concept was interesting and made me wonder how these writers come up with these new and interesting concepts.",1212710400,,681,4.198473282442748
2608133,3,B000GFRI5Y,"Steve Kady works for the Census Bureau.  And for some reason, he has to head out from Chicago to a small town of Rockwell Falls to count heads.  There seems to be a discrepancy.

Rockwell Falls looks like any other normal small country town.  However, Kady starts to pick up odd things about the town.  One major odd thing that catches his attention is that the population has remained 436 for the last century.

And the strangest thing of it all is that he is one of the 436.  Therefore, he cannot leave town.  Of course, this only motivates Kady to leave town.  Does he?  Or will he accept his fate and become a resident?

I thought the movie was good with the plot being fairly simple.  Definitely better than *2001 Maniacs*.  Watch this film but don't expect to be impressed.",1208304000,,779,4.439716312056738
2608134,3,B000GFRI5Y,"This movie has a great idea, a peaceful,idylic, backwoods town lives in harmony, but they have a terrible secret. A census taker soon visits the quite town and finds out he cant leave!

The story idea is a good one and the acting in this ""B"" horror film is far better than most and keeps the viewer hooked till the climax. After that, it doesnt take much to figure out the ending and wishing they would hurry up and get there.

Good points: Great story idea, decent acting, believable setting.
The Bad: little or no explanation as to Why the town has a secret, the ending is one you have seen a million times over.

Rent it, but don't expect much.",1199404800,3,647,4.330578512396694

2608136,4,B000GFRI5Y,"Welcome to Rockwell Falls--""the most perfect place on earth""
Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto), a census taker, soon learns upon arrival in Rockwell Falls, that this is not an ordinary town, for one thing--everyone is cheerful with a big smile, eager to make his stay in Rockwell Falls a pleasant and happy one. Immediately, I would be seeing red flags if this was me. But it doesn't take Steve long to find that all is not well in this little paradise. People begin to disappear, taking ill with ""the fever"" and they don't seem to recover. The country doctor practices with primitive equipment, bizarre treatment and has no accreditation from a medical university of any kind. But most strangely, the town's population has remained 436 for the last two centuries.
After a horrifying display at the local Festival, Steve realizes just how far the townspeople will go to maintain that population. No one can leave. NO ONE. And those that try and are caught, must endure electric shock therapy and crude lobotomies. Ouch!!

POPULATION 436 is a satisfying film, an excellent entry into the quiet horror, there isn't any gore, just the suggestion of it. I don't remember a peep of fanfare when this film was released last year-2006- which is a shame because this was quite good and deserved a shot at being heard.
Also Fred Durst does a great job as Bobby, the deputy who befriends Steve, which really surprised me.

So, check out POPULATION 436. It's a great ride, full of chills, thrills and creepy wide smiles. And remember--you can't ever leave!!",1181088000,2,1538,4.821969696969697
2608137,2,B000GFRI5Y,"The basic idea of ""Population 436,"" which is exactly what the film title says, sounds like one extended episode from ""The Twilight Zone"" or maybe ""Star Trek."" Some say they are impressed with the film's main idea, which I also liked. Another thing I can say about the film is that for all tis great idea its story might have worked better within the format of TV programs. ""Population 436"" is longer than it should be almost by 30 minutes, showing its hands too early in its storytelling, in fact, in its opening.

A census-taker Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto) sent from Chicago is stranded in an isolated town of Rockwell Falls. He meets a young girl who is eager to listen to the world outside. He has a nightmare every night. He feels there's something strange going on in Rockwell Falls, where townspeople are all looking at him smilingly. All these things are familiar, but familiarity itself is not a big problem. But its poor storytelling is.

The film is directed by Michelle Maxwell MacLaren, whose previous works are mainly for TV, as producer. In spite of the film's decent photography and effective acting from the cast including Jeremy Sisto, almost everything is told in a wrong order. As I am not allowed to discuss the film's story in detail, I cannot reveal the premise of the film, of which implausibility is less damaging to the film compared with the slow-moving way it is revealed in the flat narrative. In other words, most people would predict what would happen quicker than the film thinks.

""Population 436"" is a mildly entertaining thriller, of which clever idea is wasted by its half-baked script.",1176163200,3,1619,4.754448398576512
2608138,1,B000GFRI5Y,This film is terrible. It is so bad I threw the disk to the garbage. It was not even good enough to be kept on my shelf. Be warned.,1174003200,3,131,3.5517241379310347
2608139,3,B000GFRI5Y,"I have to be honest with you, the only reason why I watched this movie was the fact that it had Fred Durst in it. Not that Im a Limb Bizkit fan, its just that I wanted to see if it was possible to suck at anything worse than he does at music. And to my surprise, its not, he acts better than he makes music. As a matter of fact, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Although, it wasn't by any means a super awesome makes me jump up and recomemend it to the world movie, it was entertaining enough to recommend to people who like movies of this type. Its a little slow paced and boring, but there is enough creepiness and tension throughout to keep you watching. And with absolutly no gore at all, this movie will disapoint gorehounds. The movie had an interesting premise, but it was a tad bit predictable. and the very last segment felt kind of tacked on and had a ""lets have a twist at the end just for to sake of having a twist"" feel to it. The alternate ending is pretty much the same only a slight variation to it. those who watched movie but missed the alternate ending should be able to figure out the change pretty easily without having to watch it, so if your thinking of buying the movie just to catch the alt ending, its not worth it.

To conclude my little rambling review, I would say this movie is average. A good time waster, that will entertain, but only worth a rental, and not a purchase.",1172534400,2,1405,4.18450184501845

2608141,4,B000GFRI5Y,"There exists a small town with a peculiar trait.  According to census records the population has not changed for dozens of decades.  Being a little slow, it is only now that the bureau decides to send someone out to check on the strange figures.  Enter our friendly census agent who gets a flat tire as soon as he crosses the town line.  The town gets few visitors so there are no hotels or boarding houses but a place is found.  The residents are friendly enough but act a little strange not least of which is that they seem to expect him to start a new life there.  But then he discovers that the figure of 436 is not an anomaly.

Now that the 436 figure is understood there is still the matter of getting out of town successfully.  Not doing so could have dire consequences.  But attempts to leave are always headed off and more dark secrets about the town are learned.  It becomes more and more imperative to leave the town.  But the big question is is there some other force other than the townsfolk involved?  The answers may surprise you.

This is quite a good film.  It quickly manages to give both the feeling of a tranquil small town as well as a feeling of impending doom (not easy to do).  The ending is almost breathtaking.  The revelations build nicely as this is a town of many disturbing secrets.  This is a classic horror film that manages to work with setting and atmosphere to deliver its message without having to rely on violence, gore, or graphic death.

I almost turned it off at first, before the movie played, just because I've wasted so much time on my life with crap like The Plague and Rest Stop.  By the end of this movie, I wanted to stand up and cheer.  It had suspense, mystery and the drama needed to make something exceptional.  Sure, the budget wasn't big and this could have been done better with a few million more dollars, but for what they had, this is amazing work.  Amazingly enough, Fred Durst even does a good job.  I think his acting career will be a lot better than his music career.  See this movie.",1169683200,12,682,4.2734375
2608143,4,B000GFRI5Y,"Fifty miles past the end of nowhere lies Rockwell Falls, a self-styled perfect town that takes its solidarity, tranquility, and - above all - its equilibrium seriously.  On the surface, it's a pleasant little town where everyone seems happy, crime is nonexistent, and you never have to look very far for your next piece of apple pie.  It's a weird thing, though; the town's population never seems to change.  It took a century for some genius at the Census Bureau to notice this oddity, but the bureaucracy finally decided to send someone out to investigate.  Rockwell Falls doesn't cotton to strangers all that well, but the local leaders have little choice but to let Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto), in to do his official government business.  Everyone seems super-friendly to him, but it doesn't take him long to figure out that something is seriously wrong with this town.  We the viewers learn early on just how Rockwell Falls keeps its population completely static, but it takes Steve a while to figure things out on his own.

Steve is stymied in his efforts to interview several members of the community; according to the mayor and local doctor, those citizens are currently suffering from ""the fever.""  This fever isn't all that rare, but old Doctor Greaver is almost always successful at curing his patients one way or another.  Steve eventually learns all about this fever, as well as the unique religious beliefs that form the basis of the town's peculiar way of life.  The more he learns, the clearer it becomes that he is expected to become a permanent resident of Rockwell Falls.  It's for his own good, really, as those who do attempt to escape the town are struck down by God himself.  Steve doesn't buy that argument for a minute.  He's determined to return to civilization as soon as possible, and he doesn't plan on leaving by himself, either.  There's an orphan girl being treated for the fever by the good doctor, and a young lady named Courtney (Charlotte Sullivan) who wants out as badly as he does.  I have to say I really liked the way this story played out, as the filmmakers chose not to play it safe - perhaps realizing that a formulaic ending would negate the effectiveness and atmosphere of the entire film.  I really got a kick out of the final scenes.  (The DVD includes an alternate ending, which I have not seen and cannot comment on.)

Population 436 never manages to become truly suspenseful, and it's certainly not scary, but it is surprisingly effective nonetheless.  After the first twenty minutes or so, the pacing of the story is quite good, letting the true nature of this local society emerge gradually, and the acting of the entire cast (even Fred Durst) is another feather in the film's cap.  As good as the film's basic concept is, this kind of story could easily have degenerated into something really silly, but director Michelle Maxwell MacLaren never allowed that to happen.  I'm not saying that everyone out there would enjoy this film, particularly action-oriented horror fans, but I think a lot of individuals will be pleasantly surprised by it - and that includes young teenagers.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why this film has an R rating - there are very few violent scenes (and none of them are the least bit gory), the language is quite pedestrian in nature (all of this takes place in a really gung-ho - albeit cult-based - religious community), and the film's one and only sex scene is tamer than many a scene you'll find on network television.",1163635200,19,3510,4.729064039408867
2608144,3,B000GFRI5Y,"A couple of friends and I rented some movies this past weekend, this being one of them.  While I was skeptical at first about renting it, I soon found the movie to be entertaining.  I won't bother with an overview of the plot, as others have covered that, but I will say that I found the movie to be well done, with the actors involved turning in solid performances.  However, I would recommend renting this movie first before deciding to purchase it.",1163635200,21,451,4.475609756097561
2608145,3,B000GFRI5Y,"Scary movies (this one is too innocuous to be called horror and too creepy to classify as suspense or thriller) are a hard lot to gauge, since the things that scare can vary so widely from person to person.  I doubt very many people will be scared (or creeped out, or disturbed, or unsettled) by this film.  However, it is a moderately intriguing flick, in its own right.

The film concerns a census worker sent to Rockwell Falls (one of those apple pie towns that seems to be frozen in the mid-30s) in order to verify their data.  While there, the worker (played ably, if not numbly, by Jeremy Sisto) discovers that the town's population of 436 has remained unchanged for a long, long time.  What follows is a twist on Shirley Jackson's The Lottery.

Jackson's very disturbing short story has made it to the screen several times, but never very effectively, since the tale's punch lies solely in its unexpected reveal; no cinematic (or televised) reveal of that same story's twist is bound to be nearly as interesting as it is on paper.  Population 436 manages to avoid that snag by tossing in a few additional elements that give the movie enough juice to keep it from being a yawner.  The juice, however, is a bit stale.

Some reviewers have compared this movie to The Wicker Man, which baffles me.  There are a few minor similarities (the same kind of similarities you'd find between, say, Star Trek and Star Wars) that aren't worth pointing out.  The Wicker Man, it is safe to say, is an aggressively, ridiculously, and almost insultingly bad film.  Population 436, while it certainly won't appeal to everyone, does its job with much less that could be called offensive or off-putting.  Even if you're the type who wouldn't like this film, you probably wouldn't hate it, either.

I enjoyed my viewing of Population 436, to be honest, because it was a sort of clean sweep, it provided me with a nice distraction, and it wasn't in any way deficient.  It's a work-horse of a movie, much like the reliable but only mildly skilled office worker who isn't in danger of being fired or given a raise anytime soon.  If you're in a fix, I'd recommend renting it or borrowing it from a friend, but I wouldn't spend the money to own it.",1163376000,5,2228,4.588383838383838
2608146,3,B000GFRI5Y,"First of all, I am not a fan of the Wicker Man, and would not compare it with this movie at all thematically. I was, however, struck by a previous poster's comparison to ""The Lottery"", which I hadn't considered, but does seem to fit.

Rockwell Falls has an unusual method of population control, and a young census bureau employee is about to discover its secret. The journey is really part mystery and part melodrama, with a few supernatural chills thrown in for good measure. The picture does a nice job of setting up the storyline and characters without getting too bogged down in unnecessary side plots. There is little drama associated with the likely outcome of the movie from the outset, but the story is told quite well and the ending is satifying, if not predictable.",1162166400,11,775,4.698529411764706
2608147,3,B000GFRI5Y,"Good idea, this movie kind of reminded me of anothe film, Dead and Buried from years ago.  A census worker goes into a town to investigate something he stumbled on, the town population of Pleasant Falls has always stayed the same.  What he uncovers is a nasty bunch of people who decide they want him to stay and will electroshock him into changing his mind.  This movie had an alternate ending that I preferred, but you can't have everything I guess.",1160352000,8,451,4.54320987654321
2608148,3,B000GFRI5Y,"Well, all the cliches of the classic thriller are here. The service people along the road to this isolated town turn away from you as you ask for directions. The fact that they are afraid to even speak of the town should give you a clue. Then once you find your way there, down an easy-to-miss gravel turn-off - the townspeople mount a superficial welcome. But if you're perceptive, you'll see there's a sort of ""'Welcome to my parlor,' said the spider to the fly"" quality to their smiles.

Then you'll find echoes of all sorts of other notable horror stories here. You may sense some twist on Shirley Jackson's famous short story ""The Lottery"" is in the offing. And there are definite echoes of ""The Wicker Man.""

But all these elements have become cliches precisely because they do work so well to build suspense. And they are good for one more go in this film. The fact that the insideous practices of a number of real-life fanatical, closed-society religious cults has become front-page news again lately, adds a touch of the topical to this film. It held my interest.

I felt as if I were myself being drawn in as a resident of the town - definitely not a good thing.",1159574400,4,1172,4.518867924528302
2608149,2,B000GFRI5Y,"Population 436, not so cleverly disguised as an original horror film, is really three parts ""Wicker Man"", one part ""Frailty"", poured over ice and served in a crappy CGI created glass.  Any viewer who has already seen either version of the Wicker Man can officially pass on this movie, as they've already seen it.  Population 436 follows the Wicker Man's plot almost scene for scene, with only slight changes to names and places.  A guy shows up in the secluded villiage where no outsiders ever go.  People are strange and generally produce a creepy vibe.  It becomes apparent the townsfolk follow some sort of whacked out religion.  A little girl is in danger.  Hero guy sees creepy children being indoctrinated into relgious rituals in the school house.  Everything is leading up to a big festival where it's obvious to everyone something very bad is going to happen.  The ending is even an exact carbon copy of the ending of the remake of the Wicker Man.

The acting and characterization aren't much better in Population 436 than in the film it emulates.  The hero is played by Jeremy Sisto, who does an amiable job playing the character he's been given, but the problem is that his character is annoying.  He's calm when he should flip out, and he flips out when he should be calm.  By the end of the movie the audience will literally be shouting at the screen, ""Just shoot someone already!  Run them over!  It's well within your rights at this point!""  The other actors really aren't worth even mentioning.  None of them give any oscar winning, let alone even noteworthy, performances.  Oh yes, and then there's the horrible CGI created fire scene.  Movie directors please take note : if you don't have the budget for superb, completely convincing CGI effects, please don't use CGI at all!  It just ruins any sense of immersion the viewer may have been experiencing previously.  The entire movie has a very ""made for TV"" feel to it, which makes sense, as this is director Michelle MacLaren's first foray out of television and into full length movies.  If MacLaren learns from the mistakes of this movie, hopefully the next one will at least be watchable.

Population 436 is a big waste of time.  Almost any other horror film is recommended over this.",1159574400,3,2254,4.73521850899743

I couldn't decide on the stars though.  It's really not a 4 star movie, but is better than a 3.  I went with the 4 because it was better than I expected.  The plot has been done before and the ending was predictable, but the film was pretty suspenseful.  Had to love Bobby.  Anyway, this film is worth a look.
