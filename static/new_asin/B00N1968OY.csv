8675544,1,B00N1968OY,I also bought this dvd thinking I'm going to learn something new and came to realize it came in DVD- R and it does not work correctly because my disk drive can't seem to read it.,1452124800,,178,3.9722222222222223
8675545,3,B00N1968OY,"Ive been involved in boxing for seven years, Krav Maga for three and MMA for five and I like the examples, but half of the DVD was commercials. If you don't know much its a good start.",1442448000,,184,4.0
8675546,2,B00N1968OY,"I typically steer away from any program that offers ""Quick"" and/or ""Simple"" in the description. Having viewed some of the authors work in the past, I knew what to expect.
The production quality is good but am a little disappointed that there isn't more talk or information leading into the actual science of this particular aspect of self defense. Mainly what is viewed are students performing repetition of strikes on a pad. Something else that is off putting is Sammy in narration advertising that if the viewer wants to know more about what is being shown, you can buy another of his DVD's or books.
Really doesn't offer much to a trained or skilled person looking for support or research material.
Also, in the ""Useless"" pressure point section, Sammy gives a list of targets from other systems that he deems ineffective for self defense. Although I somewhat agree with some of them being taught as fight enders and instant knockout is delusional, can tell you by personal experience others have some merit and are extremely effective if trained in application.",1438473600,2,1064,4.916666666666667
8675547,5,B00N1968OY,"A practical dvd which doesn't waste time with ineffective pressure points when dealing with a life or death/injury situation. This dvd deals only with effective, neck and up, pressure points which will help in real world situations.",1415232000,,232,5.297297297297297
8675548,5,B00N1968OY,"So, you obviously know to punch people in the head. However, the question remains, ""Where in the head?"" This DVD shows you. Sammy provides explanations and drills for striking to the head. There's a lot of BS when it comes to pressure points; Pressure Point Fighting gets rid of that and only shows you the practical, effective stuff. Make sure to pair this DVD with Sammy's Body Opponent Bag Training DVD.",1415232000,,406,4.732394366197183
8675549,5,B00N1968OY,Sammy franco is a very good instructor. Easy to follow. Always buy for my partner who is a security guard and he raves about it. He wants the whole series!!! He found this particular one good as he has often used these moves to take someone down quickly at work,1415145600,2,261,4.24
