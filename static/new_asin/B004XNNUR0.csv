8447285,5,B004XNNUR0,"This is a weirdly fascinating story.  Eileen Atkins is brilliant as usual and by the end of the story you are left with more questions than answers.  This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those who enjoy dissecting complicated story lines, it is a must see.",1424217600,,266,4.408163265306122
8447286,4,B004XNNUR0,"The talented Eileen (now Dame Eileen) Atkins carries this passable story about a woman who may be an amnesiac or be suffering a mental illness or post traumatic stress  -  and is implicated in the death of a woman who claims to have been an old school friend. The otherwise tiresome Nelly wanders around wondering about her lost identity and trying to piece together her fairly yawnworthy pedestrian past. Best left forgotten, I say. The husky and melodious tones of Susannah York provide the narration. Good British actors such as Barbara Jefford and Anthony Bate provide support. Someone should've simply told Nelly to shutup and go home.",1361664000,,640,4.97196261682243
