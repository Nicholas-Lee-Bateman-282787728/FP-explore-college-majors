8320762,3,B001MA1V9Q,"40 minute program of basic stretches for the aging population, with playful ideas to spend time with young grand children. The stretches demonstrated may be too difficult for the beginner who does not exercise regularly, but with effort, one can keep up with the participants. The no-pressure, easy approach will be encouraging to the practitioner. Breathing and meditation are touched on, thereby not losing the essence of Yoga.

The program emphasizes being happy, but the narrator keeps mentioning 'problems' and 'solutions', as though this is a counseling session.",1265587200,3,568,5.454545454545454
