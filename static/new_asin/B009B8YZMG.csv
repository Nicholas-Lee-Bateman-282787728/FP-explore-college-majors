5313359,5,B009B8YZMG,"I am mesmerized by the period in and around WWII. I lived during that time but was too young to totally understand the world outside of my small existence. I first became aware of  what a land girl was in the series ""Foyle's War"". It is a fresh and enlightening story of girl's from different non-farm environments coming together to do their job to keep the country fed while the boys were away fighting to keep them safe. Great purchase and worth the investment.",1369785600,2,464,4.523809523809524
5313360,4,B009B8YZMG,"A wonderful engaging series.  I would have liked sub titles, however, since you can't understand everything they say. Strong English accents.",1363564800,2,141,5.714285714285714
5313381,5,B009B8YZMG,"A DRAMA, not documentary, done expertly by BBC to honor the service women gave in WWII. It takes a rap for changes, such as costume color, but the experience of seeing a stunning filming of a very dramatic portrayal of the times is well worth the liberty taken for the sake of aesthetic license. The spirit of the times and of the ladies is there. There is an episode that shows almost all of the unpleasantries that also goes along with wartime. One episode continues into the next.

Of course viewers can recognize that not every soldier and civilian lived a life exactly like the characters of this fictional presentation. One uncaring Yank does not make an army of such. As in the wonderful series ""Foyle's War"", the episodes offer glimpses into the 40's time, and a taste of the home front war. It is sometimes so spectacular in visual imagery that one forgets it is wartime. The acting is spot on. Costumes convincing, sets true. You will be enriched, enlightened, see romance and humor, as well as suffer the losses felt by characters. The writing is authentic enough to keep this war gals' story away from the column of `chick flic'. It's home front reality, scripted as fiction..

This series has a bit more romance. See every episode synopsis on my individual series reviews.

Definitely one to own for watching each year. However, buying sets 1,2,3 individually, used, is cheaper. But the new combo price is cheaper than when I bought mine. Loan to friends who like war period British drama. Remember, it's not an historical documentary, it has some altered facts, but that's done for entertainment value. Entertain it WILL!",1402012800,3,2394,5.795454545454546
5313382,1,B009B8YZMG,"I love the era. As a child of the WWII ""war years"" and with a significant number of persons in my immeiadate
family and extended family have a great interesst in things associated with that time.
Land Girls (the entire collection) stands as a shining stinker. Poor in every respect. Technical accuracy, writing, acting and pii poor production values make this a total waste of my disposable income.
Save your cash and more importantly your time and run do not walk away from this rubbish.
It recieved one star for packaging which was much MUCH better than the contents.",1396137600,2,569,4.757575757575758

5313384,4,B009B8YZMG,"This series was commissioned by the BBC to commemorate the 70th outbreak of WW II. There are three seasons in the series, and the focus is on the lives of several girls who join the British Land Army during the war. The stories center around interesting and familiar themes such as relationships, family, loyalty, and betrayal. Of all the seasons, my personal favorite is Season One as it had a good balance between the comic and the tragic, and the casting was also much better in Season One (although some characters appear in all three seasons). Nevertheless, the series is engaging, although by all accounts not completely faithful to the details of the period.

Season One centers around four girls, i.e. Nancy, Joyce, Annie, and Bea. Nancy (Summer Strallen) and Joyce (Becci Gemmell) are the new arrivals at the beginning of the series, arriving at Hoxley Manor where they meet the imperious Lady Hoxley (Sophie Ward) and her laidback husband (played by Inspector Lynley's Nathaniel Parker). Nancy is not used to the rough life at first, but eventually gets into a rhythm while also getting into trouble; Joyce pines for her RAF pilot husband; and, Annie (Christine Bottomley) is an overprotective older sister to younger sis Bea (Jo Woodcock). All four girls are supervised by Esther Reeves (Susan Cookson) and live at the farm owned by Farmer Finch (Mark Benton) and his son, Billy. The themes of marital infidelity, teen pregnancy and marriage, desertion, etc are the highlights of this season.

Season Two sees the departure of Annie and Nancy, and more's the pity as their storylines were engaging in Series One. The new girl in Season Two is slick city girl, Connie (Seline Hizli) who creates all kinds of trouble for the others with her teasing and audacious ways, but over time it is evident she has a good heart and gets into a romantic entanglement with the local vicar. Marital strife is explored at great length in this season.

Season Three sees the departure of Bea and Billy, and the new addition is young Iris Dawson (Lou Broadbent). This season takes a much darker turn with Esther being put through some trying times, her son Martin getting in with bad company, and a spy on the loose.

If you don't mind some historical inaccuracies in the portrayal of the characters and their lives during a turbulent period, and enjoy watching a period drama with heavy melodrama, then this might be your cup of tea. I enjoyed it, although it doesn't rank as one of my all-time favorite BBC period dramas.",1392249600,4,2516,4.81712962962963

5313387,4,B009B8YZMG,"I was hoping for something more historical and less melodramatic. The setting is beautiful, the acting is very good but the writing is more for the soap opera than a serious/entertaining look at the lives of the Land Girls. If there are more episodes I will watch them, hoping for better writing.",1386547200,2,296,4.711538461538462

8539345,1,B009B8YZMG,"This is a soap opera, and not remotely associated with any real historic facts.  Do not mistake it for an historical drama.  The characters are trite, the plots are silly and often obvious, and the series is dreadfully over-acted (I thought ham was rationed during the war!).  It is also very politically correct.  Any comparison to Foyle's War, an excellent mystery series set in the same period, is grossly misleading.  Land Girls is just the latest in a series of programs from both the BBC and PBS that rewrite history in order to promote a social agenda.  History should be presented as it was, not how some think it should have been.  Otherwise, how will anyone learn from the mistakes society has made in the past?  Watch this if you are in the mood for a soap.  If you want realistic historical drama, look someplace else.",1405814400,3,830,4.63013698630137
