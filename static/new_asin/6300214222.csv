234800,5,6300214222,"One of the greatest films of the eighties, ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" -- the tale of a raw recruit struggling to complete a  gruelling training program in an aviation academy -- combines impressive  performances from its stellar cast with a storyline exploring issues of  romance, friendship and the courage to survive. The relationship between  the recruit Zach Mayo (Richard Gere) and the tough gunnery seargeant Foley  (an unforgettable Louis Gosset Jr.) is the focus of the film. Foley warns  Mayo that he will be courting the local girls at his own risk, since some  may deliberately cause themselves to get pregnant in order to ensnare  budding aviators into marrying them. This theme is poignantly developed  when Mayo's best friend, played by David Keith, sacrifices his aviating  career for the sake of a girl who fakes her pregnancy to trap and deceive  him, leading to his tragic suicide. The dialogue between the two friends in  the mess room is one of the most absorbing scenses in the film. It makes a  significant point about individuality and responsibility. Mayo is the  clear-headed realist: he believes that one should always put his own  self-interest first and concern himself primarily with his own welfare, a  view which is opposed by his duty-bound and eventually love-crossed friend,  the kind-hearted loser whose morality gets the better of his sense. A very  uplifting film, with excellent support from Debra Winger as Mayo's love,  Paula. There is also an excellent musical score by Jack Nitzsche.",963619200,,1527,5.084677419354839
234801,5,6300214222,"One of my all time favorite movies. Taylor Hackford is a brilliant  director.  Takes me back to the days when I was in boot camp.  Also like  the way the music was themed, particularly with last scene. Excellent  acting for Richard Gere, Luis Gossett and Tony Plana.  I have been waiting  a long time for it to come out on DVD.",960681600,,327,4.262295081967213
234802,3,6300214222,this film is Hit&miss through out but the Performances of Richard Gere at times & Louis Gossett Jr put this film at a solid Level.it's still watchable but not Richard Gere at his best.a pretty good film but a bit  Overrated.cuz the film has alot of Cliches and Un-Needed Drama at times.,952214400,,286,4.5
234803,5,6300214222,"Initially, my first impression of this movie was this movie was going to be boring.  Then, after the first 20 minutes, my mind went into another direction.  I found this movie to be interesting, and I knew there had to  be some meaning to the movie.  And indeed there was!
  Zack  Mayo, (Richard Gere) is a college graduate who pursues a chance to become a  naval officer by entering the Officer Candidate Training School. In 14  solid weeks, Zack progresses and learns the ability of leadership,  friendship, and discipline, through his tough drill instructor, (Louis  Gossett Jr, in his Oscar-winning performance), and his friends.
Mood and tone are expressed intelligently through the emotions of  adventure, torture, romance, and entertainment.  My favorite aspect of this  movie is Jack Nitzsche's unforgettable scoring.  The mood and tone ties in  together as the music plays, and makes the audiences feel spontaneous of  what they are watching (especially with the love themes).
  This movie, starring Richard Gere, Debra Winger, David Keith, Lisa Blount,  Louis Gossett Jr., Robert Loggia, and Lisa Eilbacher, was the winner  recipient of 2 Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actor: LOUIS  GOSSETT JR., and Best Original Song: ""UP WHERE WE BELONG."" Also  nominated for 4 additional Academy Awards, including Best Actress: DEBRA  WINGER, Best Original Screenplay: DOUGLAS DAY STEWART, Best Original Score:  JACK NITZSCHE, Best Film editing, and nominated for a total of 8 Golden  Globes, this movie unmarks the boundary between love and adventure.
Richard Gere, even though nominated for a Golden Globe, should of  been nominated for an Oscar.  His outstanding performance brought the true  nature of what it's like to be his character. This was the performance of  his entire career!
With a clear-cut picture, and sharp sound,  this movie will never grow old in your home!  I would positively recommend  this movie to another.",951523200,46,1941,5.238562091503268
234804,5,6300214222,"An old-fashioned, well-made movie, featuring terrific performances by both austere Richard Gere and the earthy Debra Winger.  Lou Gossett, Jr.'s Oscar was well-deserved; his character drips with humanity. Taylor Hackford  directed this movie with a lively spirit and an involving emotional core;  the love story, though predictable, is mesmerizingly so, and the music,  variations on Up Where We Belong, drives home the heart of the movie in the  most enjoyable way.  This movie easily stands the test of time, and will  deliver with repeated viewings.  And that ending -- what an exhilarating  rush of emotion!  This is what the movies are about.",945388800,11,647,5.254901960784314
234805,5,6300214222,"This is Richard Gere's best performance.  The story is so human, and believable with a deliberate pace that keeps you feeling the drama until the end.  Terrific acting performances by Louis Gossett Jr. and Debra  Winger combine to make this an unforgettable film.  I recommend this movie  to anyone who hasn't seen it.  You'll love this movie if you like drama,  great actors, and a motivational story (Mayo's character throughout the  film).  This is one of my favorite movies.",941587200,,478,4.949367088607595
234896,5,6300214222,"Richard Gere in one of his best roles as Zack Mayo, a self-centered loner who joins the Navy right after he graduates college because he wants to be a jet pilot. Although Mayo is the focal point, this film is about more than just his story. Debra Winger and Lisa Blount (who tragically passed away in 2010) are excellent at the two ""Puget Debs"" who hook up with Mayo and his friend and fellow officer candidate, Sid Worley (David Keith, in a superb supporting performance). Louis Gossett Jr., as the Marine Corps drill instructor, who sees the flaws in Mayo's character, is as memorable in this film as the real life DI's are to those who have been in the military have had. Gossett's performance rates right alongside R. Lee Ermey's in Full Metal Jacket and it gives some great examples of tactics and language that are no longer used in today's military training. Worthy of honorable mention are Harold Sylvester, Lisa Eilbacher, and David Caruso as officer candidates, who show that Mayo isn't the only one with obstacles to overcome to complete AOCS. The ending scene is not easily predictable and is one of the all-time best romantic film endings I've ever seen.",1521417600,,1167,4.7254901960784315
234897,3,6300214222,"Viewed in 2018 I can't help but be proud of Deborah Winger's body FOR her. Bravo. And DIG the sex scenes,between Winger and Gere, they have me asking, um, is this real? It looks real, is that some real 'gasms? Looks like it, sounds like it...only the two of them know for sure. On behalf of all of the fake boob haters in the world, I'd like to say SALUTE.  As for all the rest of the movie, well, it's a solid script with some teeth in it and some back story, and much realism, and great acting. I haven't seen it in decades and was plenty entertained. I remembered it back when as being offensive ONLY because in 1978 any girl worth her salt was NOT trying to improve her place in life by getting married to it, but to BE it. Oh and ""trapping"" a guy by deliberately getting pregnant and then refusing to have an abortion? That was considered the lowest of the low in the late seventies.",1519948800,3,888,4.192982456140351

234900,3,6300214222,"The most interesting part of the movie was Gere's relationship with the drill sergeant, who more or less functioned as surrogate father for him, since Gere's own father was incapable of helping him become a man.

234947,2,6300214222,"This movie is a moral wasteland, an extended view of the seamy side of life: drunkenness, prostitution, vomit, blood, bullying, cruelty, violence, nudity, cheating, stealing, lying, promiscuity, torrents of profanity, ethnic and racial slurs, and the glorification napalming children.

235144,5,6300214222,"Even if this is slightly dated fare (except those explicit sex scenes with Gere and Winger!) I gave this overall disc a 5 star rating for a general favoritism to this early 80's movie and a nicely detailed not too talky commentary by Director Taylor Hackford.
I saw AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN in the theatre when I was just 15 very fortunate, indeed, the local suburban movie house allowed a small group of boys - obviously under 17 - to witness the R-rated move without an adult.
But, I became a fan of Richard Gere and, of course, Debra Winger who not surprisingly became a sex symbol in the eyes of any teenager after seeing this one.  Besides, you could tell too:  She was a serious actress.
At the time of this 1982 release Lou Gossett Jr. nailed what would become the typical drill Sergeant role eventually saved for ex real life drill Sergeant R Lee Ermey.

Taylor Hackford mentions an ""accident"" that occurred during filming that put the entire cast and crew on hold forcing the Director to offer an ultimatum to cast member who was, basically, at fault for 'her' own mishap.  Makeup was applied but bruise is visible (it is), Hackford explains, in first scene she filmed after 'hospital stay' (well, I find that stuff interesting).  Hackford also mentions Gere and Winger worked and 'pushed' each other well, more than the 'stories' that they did not get along.
I, personally, could not believe how well I remembered this movie finding myself quoting lines like I had just seen it last  week which is nowhere near true.  I hadn't seen AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN in over 15 yrs (on AMC - probably HORRIBLY cut up) which did remind me I had probably watched this another 10 times on cable one summer when still a teenager.
Too bad Lisa Blount was given that ""Way to go Paula..."" line.  And they chose to keep it in.  People still yell at her to this day for that bad choice/cheesy line!
Still, overall, AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN is surprisingly entertaining love story, action movie without a gun shot fired!  So much happens, including my favorite (kind of sappy scene, yes) scene with Mayo helping ""Ohhh, Seeegar"" (Lisa Eilbacher, looking stunningly NOT all that attractive) over the training wall.  Gets me every time.  It even gets to Sgt. Foley.",1489017600,4,2258,4.631578947368421

Richard Gere is phenomenal as rebellious loner Zach Mayo who has been deeply scared by his mother's suicide & his father's life style. Debra Winger is marvelous as the young lady who loves him. We see Zach grow from a rebellious man who faces his demons thanks to the Oscar winning performances of Louis Gossett Jr who plays the extremely tough drill Sargent. Also marvelous performances by David Keith who is Zach's best friend who adds to the emotional roller coaster Zach is on. We watch and love the rebellious punk who becomes an Officer & a Gentlemen.,1481328000,,663,4.487603305785124

The part where they all go through water survival. Real, I can assure you. (And if you're not a strong swimmer, it's not much fun.)

What makes this movie work? Louis Gossett, Jr. HE DOES. His portrayal of the Marine Gunnery Sergeant is spot on. It's as if the man did some time in the Corps himself. HE made the movie work. Semper Fi, Gunny.",1468454400,4,517,4.222222222222222

236303,4,6300214222,I saw this movie when it first was released so was curious to see how it held up over time. I found that I enjoyed it as much the second time. The plot is well done and Richard Gere and Debra Winger are great in their roles. Despite reading that Debra Winger disliked Richard Gere and detested the love scenes their chemistry was very positive onscreen. Two women are looking to marry an officer and escape from their boring deadend factory jobs. One wins her officer without trying to hold onto him. The other tries through a lie and succeeds only to create tragedy. The drill sergeant is a highlight of the movie.,1459296000,2,615,4.451327433628318

236633,5,6300214222,"I've watched a lot of similler storys before. A guy who comes to the training place and meets a girl. He will eventually leave the place so the love will be the time limit thing.
There are actually two couples who meet the girl at a bar. They all fall in love with women.
One couple is Richard Gear/Deborah Winger and the other is David Keith/Lisa Blount. Deborah seems to love Richard but has doubt that he will stay for her so she meets other man too. Lisa on the other hand loves David because he is an officer. When she found out that he quit the training because he though that she is pregnant, she instantly steps down and tells David that I won't marry you since you are not an officer anymore. I loved you because I wanted someone who can travel all around the place as an officer.
Deborah on the other hand truely loved Richard.
When Richard saw his friend David kills himself by hanging his neck, he runs to his girlfriend Deborah where she works in a factory. Everyone look at the couple even clap their hands.
It is a cheesy little hollywood story but was ok.
I don't understand that why Deborah Winger was in her full nudity in this film. it was not absolutely necesarry. It was not bad seeing her beautiful body and all but I say it was really not necesarry. It could be rated PG-13.",1456963200,2,1297,4.297959183673469

236736,5,6300214222,An absolute classic. Stand out performance by the naval training officer Foley. Very inspirational and emotionally heartfelt movie. Too many people call this movie a romance though. This is not a romance. There are of course romantic elements to it but An Officer and A Gentleman is more about working class American men and women. The movie is essentially about young people trying to follow their hopes and dreams. You've got two young guys trying to be naval officers and two young women who are factory workers trying to meet the men of their dreams in hopes of escaping their dull lives. Without a doubt this is one of the most inspirational and uplifting movies I've ever seen. Sure it's pretty dated and cheesy in certain areas but that's part of it's charm. The thing that's interesting about this film isn't the romantic aspects or even the naval academy training. What's really interesting is how realistic all of the events and relationships are portrayed. The film deals with some heavy subjects and isn't afraid to take some chances with comedy or drama. The scene in the middle of the film is particularly interesting when Foley is basically getting to the root of Zach's problems and playing with his head. This all leads to a fight between the two towards the end of the movie. This is seriously an awesome scene. Absolutely one of my all time favorites.,1456790400,4,1370,4.784810126582278

Lou Gossett Jr. gave an excellent performance as the Drill SGT. This reminded my days in basic training although I was in the ARMY. What he did is after all, a job in itself. Richard Gere gave his all and was finally humbled towards 3/4 of the film especially after his pal committed suicide. Debra Winger although reluctantly couples Richard Gere even though she does not want to admit it. She is very embarrassed of her nude scenes and I am sure she will be more careful about her contract.

237241,5,6300214222,"When I first saw this film, being too young and nave to understand it, I thought the sergeant was a complete jerk, being needlessly rough and even unfair towards his new recruits. Upon several viewings, I finally understood the sergeant's true intentions. He's not being mean for the sake of causing unhappiness. He's pushing his recruits outside their comfort zones to see who they really are for the purposes of revealing their strengths and weaknesses. Even during his opening speech, Sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr, in an academy-award winning role), he tells them he will use methods fair and unfair to expose their weaknesses, and he expects more than half of them to D.O.R., military abbreviation for ""drop on request"".

Zack Mayo (Richard Gere in his first acclaimed starring role), an Italian-American in the lower middle-class, has joined the Navy. He wants to become a naval pilot, but he must first endure and persevere through a basic-training program at the hands of one of the toughest sergeants in the Navy before the military will allow him to sit in the pilot's seat of a plane. When the new cadet-trainees line up before Sergeant Foley, he tells them that even before they can start learning how to fly planes, they must prove to him they are of the right material for the job. He scolds them for listening to too much ""Mick Jaggar music"" and defaming their country. He then engages them on a rigorous training program which makes other military programs seem like Romper Room by comparison. However, we notice something about Zack from the get-go: he's a loner. While the other recruits immediately bond and try to pull for one-another to survive the training, Zack is often on the side, alone. He does befriend one other trainee, Sid Worley (David Keith), a young southerner who has family ties to the military.

Foley warns the cadets about the local women looking for officer-pilots to date and possibly marry, but Zach and Sid take no heed and instead go out during evenings to meet women in the local town. Zach finds Paula (Debra Winger in an equally compelling performance), a working girl at a paper factory, and they immediately embark on a relationship. However, Paula is uncertain whether Zach truly loves her or whether he's just using her as temporary companionship and sexual release while he's enduring the trainee torture at the hands of Foley. Sid also meets a woman, Lynette, who desires to marry a pilot. When he is invited to have dinner with Paula's family, Zach learns Paula has had a habit of dating potential pilots, and her father was one such pilot-cadet in the same program. Paula was born out of wedlock.

However, Zach has a little secret. He's been trading in a black market of military accoutrements, hiding his inventory above one of the ceiling panels in his dormitory room. He buys them in bulk wholesale from another soldier from a different company who has extra items on hand, and then resells them to his fellows at a profit. Usually the customer-soldier comes to Zach's ""store"" when he needs something which looks shiny and new for inspection. Often, if a cadet doesn't pass inspection he or she may lose their time off, so Zach always has customers willing to buy. Then one day, when an African-American recruit is desperate for an item to pass inspection, Sergeant Foley arrives in the room and says ""In every class, there's always one joker who thinks that he's smarter than me.""

This is just simply a fine story from beginning to end with a top-notch cast. Gere offers his first challenging performance in which he rises to the occasion, one of many to come during the course of his career. In particular, Louis Gossett almost steals the show as the tough but fair-minded sergeant who desires only the best soldiers for the pilot training program. Apparently, his part was written with a white sergeant in mind, but Gossett makes every piece of dialogue his own, and as far as I know the part was little changed when Gossett was cast. Honorable mention also to Debra Winger as Zach's love interest. An amazing story of growth and transcendence.",1448323200,2,4111,4.818696883852692

237368,4,6300214222,"Douglas Day Stewart's rousing military romance picture follows a young and up-and-coming Richard Gere as he trains as an AOC under the brutal but right hand of Louis Gossett Jr.'s drill instructor--he's not as unrelenting as Sergeant Hartmann (for example), but he's just as tough, and willing to see his men through some devastating personal hardships as they train for the ""prize."" The emotionally involving backstory to Gere's Zachary character, and the personal investment that we are asked to make in the lives of these men, make ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" an exemplary film achievement in the area of quality narrative drama. Zach's gently unfolding love for his conquest Paula--a meager factory worker who would like nothing more than to have a shot at a better life with a man who can provide for her in full.
I am mainly deducting a star from this movie due to the fact that I do not find the DVD transfer to be of top-notch quality--the picture is a bit grainy here and there. Also, a few reviewers on this page are complaining that the ""director's cut"" version has a different feel than the original theatrical release, but since I have only the DVD copy to go on for the purposes of my review, I find the cut that we have here to be quite solid indeed. The love song ""Up Where We Belong"" is a legendary piece of music for a reason, and a guitar driven instrumental track of that music flows throughout the film (I initially thought that it was merely a single piece of music played on pop radio stations, but it also works alarmingly well as instrumental music in the movie). Of course, that song did deserve the Oscar that it got. Also, the movie has a serious dramatic tone about it, minus the rather evil tone found in a lot of movies made after 2000 and beyond. While some may think it is too explicit, the sex scenes in ""Officer..."" are more relaxing than erotic (I mean, the love story is in full bloom here, and I found nothing offensive about the picture at all), and that is a good thing because the nudity doesn't pull us out of the story by becoming a distraction. All of the performances are top-notch, and director Taylor Hackford proves his working class approach to cinema is probably the one to go after if you desire watching an intellectually honest motion picture. Maybe the script isn't as brilliant as some believed it to be at the time, but it's the kind of movie that you can watch any time and settle in to watch, and that's worth something. The rather audacious ending alone proves that this is probably Hackford's best film, and one of the more important mainstream American movies from the 1980's. And while the fight scene between Gere and Gossett is not quite as rough as I thought it was going to be, it's still pretty intense to watch.
Extras include a commentary track that is involving listening for fans of the film, plus a decent making of in which writer Stewart explains the origins of the story (but doesn't go into great depths about its conception--the original script had almost no dialogue, really?) and offers up several nice comments from Gossett, Gere, and some other cast members and executives. It's a time capsule piece that is a keeper. The 'hand to hand combat' featurette is interesting, but fairly unnecessary given the commentary track. And the clip about the writing of the hit song (featuring an interview with lyricist Will Jennings) is a fun piece for creative-minded people to enjoy (Jack Nitzsche was almost fired from the film early on, from what I gathered).
So, overall rating is a solid A- (but I have to take the stars down a notch due to the sub-standard picture quality--and I have not yet seen the Blu-Ray print so I can't comment about that). Feels like this might make a good double feature with ""Top Gun"" or ""American Gigolo"" or ""Flashdance"" or ""Urban Cowboy""--or even ""The Other Side of Midnight"" or ""Summer of '42"", for that matter.",1443916800,2,3918,4.6388489208633095

Richard Gere and Debra Winger give outstanding acting performances, along with the rest of the cast. The brilliant story has you anxious to see how it would end, as you cheer on a beautiful, loving relationship. There are scenes that are happy, sad, and thought-provoking. I remember hearing everyone clapping their hands, and seeing the smiles on viewers faces as we watched the final curtains close. I had a good feeling and was thrilled with the ending, and it was quite obvious that I wasn't the only viewer, who felt that way.

238742,5,6300214222,"Look closely this is not a movie about the military but about life. More specifically about being lucky enough to find one self when you're young. A movie about status, social mobility, class, relationships, troubled young men and women, suicide, and love.

This is  also about the card game as Ernest Hemingway would have described it that is played out between men and women whereby men attempt to seduce women and women wish to be valued for more than as prostitutes. And how some times that game can end in true love, but some times it can unleash forces beyond our control that can even kill.

The main protagonist is Mayo played by Richard Geer. A navy brat with a troubled history. Who's not a team player because he's been hustled for so long and hustling for so long that he doesn't know when to recognize in life when you can start trusting people. His best friend is played by David Keith as Sid Sorley a troubled kid who has all sorts of emotional baggage who begins swimming in the deep end of the pool called the game of love before he's even aware of it. As we will find out later this has tragic results.

I'm not afraid to admit that I began to tear up as I saw where this movie was headed. Sid Sorley is a great kid. He's an all American kid who got carried away having what began as a sexual vacation. Young-men who are immature are known to do this. What I found especially tragic is that the women who wants to marry him and whom he later is willing to give up everything for both carry a common psychic scar. They both lost sibling in the Vietnam war. Sid a nice kid is unwilling to open up about this as well as other emotional problems hes having.

This is very sad to me because medical as well as testimonial evidence is now coming to light that shows that the families and children of veterans of not just the Vietnam war but possibly all wars some times inherit emotional scars from their families service to our country. If you don't believe me check out a book titled, 30 months with my father, by the daughter of a Vietnam vet and visit her website. I must admit I just found out about this book a few days ago and look forward to reading it I may up date this review after reading this book.

I teared up as I saw the inevitable closing in around Sid Sorley. Military bases must have there share of young men and women like him. Kids really who have an emotional roller coaster in their heads cascading out of control that threatens to destroy them. And they have no one to trust no one to talk to. They must feel so emotionally stranded, so hopeless, so alone. The darkness chasing after them wanting to grasp them in it's eternal embrace. And the hart breaking thing is that they are the best and the brightest we have as a society to offer.

I felt greatly for Sid Sorley he just wanted to be loved for who he was he was an emotionally damaged kid. who commits suicide. Sadly, suicide in our society is completely misunderstood. People think that it is the act of a coward. An act of volition. It isn't suicide occurs according to the medical data in people who have 95% of the time a preexisting mental illness. Their are chemicals in the brain and spinal column that if they ever dip below a certain level anyone no matter how tough you think they are, how religious, disciplined, will begin to have suicidal thoughts. This is why I ached as I saw Sorley hurt so much for no good resason. Modern medicne now has medications which prevent this from happening. Theirs therapy. I wept as Sorley needlessly killed himself how easily it could have been avoided if he had just been under the care of a professional.

But this movie is to some extent about the redeeming power of true love the love felt between Richard Geer's character and the beautiful girl next door female lead. I cheered as I'm sure you  did when he swept her up and carried her away like some dime store romance novel hero. Mayo who has emotional issues do to the suicide of his mother, his raising and intimacy issues do to being raised 'on top of the raunciest whore house in the Philipine Island.' Overcomes his issues and shows maturity in sweeping his love away.

But that's not even my favorite scene. Mine is when Geer wakes up after a night of love making and find his now girlfriend making breakfast in the kitchen. This demonstrates that love is not always an epic quest depicted in romance movies or novels. It is for more ordinary people, well, more ordinary waking up and realizing that some one cares for you because they made breakfast. I love the conversation that ensues in that scene that was when they had both stopped playing cards and were really falling in love. This is a wonderful movie.

238831,5,6300214222,"I enjoyed the movie a great deal but really found the director's commentary fascinating.  They had a pretty low budget to contend with and the Navy did not cooperate.  Consequently the director had to have his crew build the pool dunking device from the plans, which played a key role in the film.  Fortunately the Marine Corps provided their support.  The results are great.  It was interesting to hear that at the graduation scene it was actually raining (which you can't really detect while watching the film.)  When everyone sat down into a small pool of water that had collected in their chairs there was apparently a collective groan from the crowd.  In the military we often speak of ""the fog of war"" (i.e. the unexpected) but there is certainly ""fog"" in the art of film making as well.",1391731200,4,793,4.661870503597123

238916,5,6300214222,"Released in 1982, ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was the obvious inspiration of films like Tom Cruise's ""Top Gun"" and ""Days of Thunder."" ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was the first and best, by far.

The plot similarities are obvious: They all include the angry young man who needs to prove his gifting, the uncompromising mentor, the encouraging babe, the craft, the arena and the doomed buddy. In ""An Officer"" the angry young man is Richard Gere as Mayo, the mentor is Louis Gossett Jr. as Drill Instructor Folely, the babe is Paula (Debra Winger), the craft is aviation basic training, the arena is a Naval academy and the Puget Sound area of Washington (shot on location) and the buddy is Sid Worley (David Keith).

Thankfully, the film doesn't get bogged down telling the back-story of Mayo. Instead, it ingeniously shares his past in a matter of minutes at the very beginning. It's all we need to know to understand why Mayo is the way he is. And then we're off to basic training where he's tested. Does he have what it takes? Can someone as lowborn, aloof and un-trusting as Mayo make it as an officer?

Debra Winger and Lisa Blount shine here as Mayo and Worley's babes. Winger is alluring in a humble ""girl next door"" type of way (she out-shined Lynda Carter as Wonder Girl on ""Wonder Woman,"" which is hard to believe), but Blount is even more alluring -- yes, despite the negative aspects of her character. I'll just put it this way, she really fills out a pair of jeans, lol.

Both couples get intimate way too quickly, but maybe this is one of the flaws of the ""Puget Debs"" and explains why they have a problems getting marriage material, if you know what I mean. Besides this, time has to be condensed in a two-hour film.

BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a film of this ilk ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is the best of the lot.

GRADE: A

INSIGHTS ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further unless you've seen the film):

An officer is a military leader. Drill Instructor Foley's job is to weed out those who can't hack it as an officer. It's an important job because people's lives in combat are dependent on the quality of the leaders and Foley takes his job seriously.

Foley rightly pegs Mayo as a lowlife loner from the outset -- a wannabe officer -- and therefore puts on the pressure. This is especially so on the one weekend where he has Mayo to himself. Foley does everything he can to make Mayo break AND quit, but Mayo doesn't. He breaks, indeed, but he refuses to quit on the grounds that he has no where to go. At the end of this scene you can see that Foley develops respect for Mayo (which you get a glimpse of earlier when Mayo does extremely well on the obstacle course).

Later, Mayo disregards breaking the record on the obstacle course (which he was definitely able to do) in order to encourage Seegar (the female recruit) to finally make it over the wall. Foley sees that Mayo's no longer the aloof and selfish loner he was when he rode in on his motorcycle. He's matured; he's developed character. It was already there, of course, but the boot camp training has brought it to the fore, and Foley sees it.

After Worley's tragic death, Mayo confronts Foley while he's drilling the platoon. Foley informs Mayo that they all know what happened and even tells him they're sorry about Worley. He didn't have to do this and it shows that Foley isn't just an honorable man, but also that he cared about Worley. After all, Worley was only one week away from graduating! In a sense, he was one of Foley's kids. In other words, Foley and the platoon were grieving too. But Mayo was closest to Worley and he's crazy with shock & grief at this point. He insists that he's going to quit, to which Foley tells him to meet him for a fight. Sure, there's some testosterone in his words, but he actually does this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out.

And Foley doesn't ""kick his axx"", as some claim. It was essentially an even match and Foley barely walks off the mat, which is the only reason he technically wins. But that's inconsequential. The purpose of the fight was to run Mayo's steam out so he didn't make a rash decision in an obvious moment of grief & anger. Foley accomplished his purpose. Once Mayo was no longer blinded by rage he makes the right choice and graduates.

This is why he thanks Foley at the end.",1390262400,,4399,4.456467661691542

238987,5,6300214222,"I watched this movie when it first came out in 1982 and watched it again recently on DVD. This means that I watched it once more than I watch most movies, which in turn means that I consider this to be a really great movie.

Its protagonist, Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) is a Naval officer candidate who comes from a troubled background. His mother committed suicide when he was young. His father, a career Navy enlisted man, is an alcoholic and womanizer who shows little true affection for the son he must live with. When Zach tells his dad that he intends to be a Navy officer, his dad gives him little support.

Zack, who is somewhat rebellious, enters officers' candidate school at a naval base in the Puget Sound area, where he butts heads with Gunnery Sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr.), whose job it is to do everything he can to break the will of the young men and women under his charge, thereby weeding out those who do not have what it takes to become worthy Naval officers. Through sheer hard work, will, and amazing determination, Zach manages to take the extra punishment he receives for his various indiscretions, while at the same time enduring the rigorous physical training the candidates all must endure.

Along the way, he meets Paula (Deborah WInger), a local girl whose immediate goal in life is to marry a naval officer. Zack, who is emotionally stunted and doesn't trust anyone, is happy to have a casual sexual relationship with Paula but resists committing himself to her. This important subplot, in which we see Zack's resistance gradually breaking down, adds immeasurably to the movie and demonstrates the depth of Zach's character.

If you haven't seen ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" before, it's definitely worth watching. If it's been a long time since you've watched it, it's worth seeing again. The story is compelling, and the acting (particularly by Gere, Winger, and Gossett) is outstanding.",1383264000,3,1923,4.818181818181818

238989,5,6300214222,"Has been a favorite for years.  True love story.  Richard Gere and Debra Winger have chemistry.  Some sex and violence, but necessary to make the film real.",1381190400,,156,4.703703703703703
238991,5,6300214222,"""An Officer and A Gentleman"" is the story about the tenacity, courage, wisdom, strength and love of a man whose dream was to be a naval aviator in the face of great odds which began as a young boy when his mother abandoned him through suicide and his alcoholic, whore-mongering father rejected him. The morning following a night of lust with a prostitute his father purchased for him as a graduation present, Zach Mayo graciously says goodbye to his father and heads out to pursue his dream. At the U.S. Naval Officer Candidate School, Zach is introduced to a lovely lady who dreams of marrying an officer. Although he is unsure about a long-term commitment to his first love interest, their heart-warming relationship is a strong support for him as he deals with the many character-building challenges that confront him during his critical training to be a pilot. While it is commendable that Zach waited until after their first date to have sex, when considering his immoral introduction to women before meeting Paula and his nonreligious upbringing, it is understandable that his resistance would not last long.

Overall, the protagonist of the story rises from the dregs of a troubled family life to become the hero with the courage and heart big enough to choose love over lust and to achieve high aspirations which promise him a bright, happy future in his career and family with the woman he loves. What is there not to love about this story? Anyone who has ever needed to or who needs to boldly overcome life's harsh realities and yet maintain a sensitive heart will experience this film with great hope matched with a satisfaction at the end that leaves the viewer feeling very inspired.",1381017600,6,1696,4.828178694158075

Romantic yes, but it's as much about the relationship between Gere, an officer candidate from a rough background, and the drill instructor, Lou Gossett Jr., whose performance as a thoroughly tough taskmaster with a profound understanding of human nature is exquisite.

Sure, the dinner was a sit-down at the local Papa Gino's, but the fact that I actually enjoyed this 'chik flik' more than the pizza is the reason for writing this review some 30 years after.
As a young man, the feeling I had as I left the cinema with my puppy love was elation, for I was certain that I was going to be cadet Mayo. I was going to win against all odds and achieve my dreams. Now, as an old man, I can only reminisce about what might have been. Funny how a few decades can change one's perspective.

239406,5,6300214222,"Richard Gere gives a very natural and fantastic performance as Zachary Mayo. Zachary goes through many challenges and tests of emotional and physical endurance on his way to becoming a naval officer via navy officer candidate school. He ends up becoming close friends with another fellow officer candidate named Sid Worley (well played by David Keith). Both Zach and Sid also meet and fall in love during their time in training. Zach's love interest Paula is played by Debra Winger. Sid's love interest Lynette is played by Lisa Blount. Louis Gossett Jr. plays a Marine Gunnery Sargeant by the name of Emil, who is a drill instructor tasked with shaping the officer candidates into leaders. I felt an urge to watch the movie because I use to be in the navy, and I was curious to get an idea of what it might be like for a soon to be officer going through bootcamp compared to the process of an enlisted person through bootcamp (I honorably served in the enlisted ranks from June 2000 until May 2009). The movie itself only takes place in one location, but I did enjoy how the characters forged special friendships and implied the traveling adventures that were going to take place once they graduated from officer candidate school (I appreciate the travel and the many wonderful friends that I met while I was in the navy).  The only caveat that I had with the movie was how some of the women were portrayed. The main female characters were beautiful but were depicted as women whose only chance at making something of themselves in life depended the long term plans of their male partners. In real life (in and outside of the military) many women have unlimited potential to achieve whatever they want regardless of their romantic status (it would have been nice if the movie would have portrayed the women as being poised for success regardless of what happens in their romantic lives). I understand that this movie was made in the early 80's before many more women became naval officers. I just wish that they would have showed a more personal romantic life of the one female officer candidate in the school as well as the men that were featured. I only say this because (over a month ago) I currently ran across an article in both airforce times and navy times that told how there is a high rate of military female veterans committing suicide, and one of the reasons cited was the fact that many of these veterans were not acknowledged for having done legitimate military service due to them being women, and as a result feelings of isolation resulted. I myself do not endorse or condone suicide because I appreciate being alive regardless of external circumstances that may appear, but I have empathy and compassion for those who do (whether military or civilian). Officer and a Gentleman is a fantastic movie, but it would be nice if more movies were featured that highlighted the personal lives of military female officers so that more members of the general public can see how both men and women make a positive contribution to our all volunteer military. Aside from my personal rant, I still highly recommend this movie as one to watch especially if you are open to seeing one of many ways of how a military person balances their personal and professional life in an interesting manner.",1295654400,2,3295,4.730434782608696

As a child, he was sent to live with his father, a career Navy man based in the Philippines, after his mother commits suicide. There he soon realized that he had to be tough and rely on no one. After graduating from college, he shocks his father by telling that he has enlisted in the Navy and will enter training as a naval aviator. There he brings the same loner attitude he has had all of his life. He does however meet Paula, an attractive young woman who often attends base functions in the hope of nabbing a young officer and Sid Worley, a classmate with whom he forms a close bond. The training is difficult but not as tough as having to deal with their training officer, Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley who teaches Zack a lesson in the importance of relying on your friends and colleagues.

Here is a perfect example of such romanticism, in a modern environment, that of a navy academy somewhere in the US. Romanticism, drama as well as happy ending, one casualty and one total epiphany. What's more you add to that the bad character of the salvaged hero at the beginning and his complete transformation into a good man, a good heart and a fair mind that will not play around and will finally do what his conscience tells him to do and his hormones force him to fall into. And what's more, the film avoids the dire tragic tone of all the rewritings of Romeo and Juliet. But of course that does not make it a great film, just a soft sweet entertaining moment in life.

239589,4,6300214222,"Part love story and part coming of age story, `An Officer and a Gentleman' tends to work on most accounts; surprisingly so.  I say surprisingly since I am not a fan of Gere and found the films prose to be a little, how would you call it, weak; but I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed this movie.  Parts are a little preposterous, or should I say a little overdone (the ending in particular is a tad over the top) but for the most part the film seems genuine.

The film tells the story of Zack Mayo, a young man who joins the Navy almost to spite his overbearing father but more-or-less to find himself.  He's a lost soul who has no where else to go.  He has sixteen weeks of training under the harsh thumb of Drill Sergeant Foley, and over the course of those sixteen weeks he bonds with his fellow trainees and falls in love with a local girl named Paula Pokrifki.

When approaching the budding romance between Zack and Paula the film works very well.  Debra Winger is a stunning actress who commands ones attention and truly knows how to make her character appear real and genuine.  Paula is a very three dimensional character even if she doesn't have a lot of screen time.  We can see her character shift from a young girl looking for some fun to a young girl fallen in love, and her grasp of her characters inner battle between right and wrong is crisp and clear.  Richard Gere is also quite convincing here as well, using his charm to break through the cold way in which he approaches relationships in general.  He is much more effective when broaching the coming of age portion of the film, allowing his back-story to play precedent and influence his characters ambitions (his breakdown during intense training is a pivotal scene that is acted with fervor and dedication).  It is a very strong performance from an actor I usually find bland and overrated.

I am shocked that Louis Gossett Jr. won the Oscar for his clich&eacute;d portrayal of Drill Instructor Foley.  I found nothing truly memorable about this performance, and would have rather seen David Keith nominated for his heartbreaking portrayal of the troubled Sid Worley.  He is especially effective in his later scenes where we witness the weight of reality crushing down on his world.  Lisa Blout has a stinging turn as the local girl trying to trap Sid, and Robert Loggia has a very good cameo in the beginning of the film but is not used afterward, which is sad, because I really like him.

In the end I can highly recommend this film.  It is nicely crafted and very enjoyable.  Sure, it isn't the most enlightening film out there, and it does come off a little `simple' at times, but the acting is for the most part memorable and the character development is a lot more stable than most films in this genre.  Winger is outstanding (so deserving of the Oscar nomination) and Gere is surprisingly deep here.",1230681600,,2895,4.552123552123552
239590,5,6300214222,"This 1982 Paramount drama tells the story of a Navy aviation officer candidate Zach Mayo(Richard Gere)who comes into conflict with the hard-nosed Marine Corps. Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley(Lou Gossett, Jr.) who trains him, but tries to make him an outcast by hazing him trying to get Zach to DOR, despite Zach's refusal to quit the Navy along with the fact that this films title used an old expression from the British Royal Navy and subsequently from the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice as being charged with ""conduct unbecoming an officer & a gentleman from 1860.

AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN starts out with Zach living with his alcoholic Navy boatswain's mate Bryon Mayo(Robert Loggia)whom Zach has been living with since his early adolescence after his mother commited suicide, so by hoping to put his life on a different path, Zach joins the Navy.

Eventually Zach & his Navy buddy Sid Worley(David Keith)meet 2 local ladies at a Navy-hosted dance which are factory workers Paula Pokrifki(Debra Winger)& Lynette Pomeroy(Lisa Blount)with whom each begins a romantic relationship with.

Therefore, that song ""Up Where We Belong"" by Joe Cocker always makes me think of this movie, since it was released around the same time as that song was.

Richard Gere and Debra Winger were a hot and cute looking couple, especially in their sexy touching lovemaking scene in the middle of the movie showing Winger & Gere in bed together in total nudity showing us everything, but Wingers coochie and Gere's pee pee, which reminds me that Richard Gere always seemed to have a way of getting his main female co-stars into bed in most of his movies back in the 1980's, but I guess that's another thing that made Gere a sex symbol back in the 80's.

This DVD also has bonus features showing the director(Taylor Hackford) and co-stars from AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN 25 years later talking about their experience & memories while filming this movie back in 1982, but I don't know whatever happened to Debra Winger and I don't understand is why didn't they show Debra Winger talking about her experience doing AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN in the bonus features, especially since Debra Winger was one of the main co-stars in this movie.

This movie takes me all the way back to memory lane when AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN was released in theatres on Wednesday July 28, 1982 when we were still going through the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president which also takes me all the way back to my childhood years of when I was living in the Imperial Valley since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time when this drama flick was made and had amassed $129, 795, 554 at the box office in the Summer of 1982.

So if you liked AMERICAN GIGOLO, BREATHLESS, or PRETTY WOMAN, you shall like AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN, since Gere does his same kind of sexy acting techniques that he used with other female co-stars in a lot of his other movies since Gere seems to get more ass than a toilet seat in his flicks.",1228953600,2,3014,4.675471698113207
239591,4,6300214222,"It is great to watch a young and buff Richard Gere evolve from a self-serving bad boy to a caring and involved friend.  I absolutely love the scene where Zach helps Segar walk the wall of the obstacle course, including watching the guys go wild with happiness over their triumph.

Debra Winger is a good actress, and you have to hand it to both Gere and Winger that they could pull this movie off when their lack of rapport was legendary.  To be fair to Gere, Winger (at least at that time) was known as a habitual problem child on the set of this and other movies.  I believe shortly after filming AOAAG she went into rehab.

I enjoy this movie for a lot of reasons, but I would hate for young girls to watch this and think that the young women (Paula and Lynette) could be so easy and still get the guys in the end.  If Paula had had more self-esteem, she would not have allowed Zach to ""kiss it all better"" after behaving so badly toward her in the hotel room.

Easy girls may get the guy for the short haul, but the Paulas and Lynettes are unlikely to form quality, lasting relationships with men that truly respect and value them.

That said, we generally watch movies to escape and to be entertained, and overall this is a compelling, well-acted movie that I still watch from time to time.",1224720000,,1295,4.322314049586777
239592,2,6300214222,"An officer and a gentleman tries to combine two plots:  1) a good-for-nothing tries to make it in the navy and  2) A romance between two people from different social standards.  These are two genres that CAN mix, but director Taylor Hackford just didn't succeed. In two hours, he showed 13 weeks of military training, a developing romance and character building. As I said before, this can be done, but Hackford just scratched the surface with every plot. He just took too little time to really show the essence of each plot. Hackford skips entire weeks and that's what killed this movie. If he stuck with 1 story (the navy one would be the best if you ask me), he probably would have made a great movie. Trying to stuff the movie with plots is not the only mistake Hackford made. His choice of actors was another. Richard Gere wasn't really at his best here. He just overacted too obvious. The scene where Mayo said the famous line ""I've got nowhere else to go"" was clearly overacted. A couple of minutes before that, Mayo said ""I ain't gonna quit"". My stomach twisted when he said that, it was simply too overacted. So, what've we got: a bad story and a really bad male lead. OK, I can see you think ""Where does that one star come from?""

239594,5,6300214222,"This film is a classic and viscerally honest portrayal of human conflict and personal growth. It clearly depicts working class young adults who sought to break away from past barriers and limitations and build better lives for themselves. It is a coming of age story, where a full spectrum of feelings are explored as young adults learn about fulfilling their potential, building value systems and attempting to fulfill personal desires with honesty and integrity on many levels. Two hot young stars were cast in the leading roles: Richard Gere who was riding high on his recent success in ""American Gigolo"" and Debra Winger who shined in her role in ""Urban Cowboy"". With stars of this caliber, it surprised me to learn (in the Special Features section) that doubts existed about the film's acceptance by theater audiences. In fact, the script had made the rounds of different studios for eight years, with no one daring to make the film which was essentially about training Naval pilots. The concern was it was too close to the end of the Viet Nam War and would be rejected by the public as being about war. Luckily, the film was interpreted very differently by the viewing audience who saw it in a positive light where personal survival, transformation and the expression of love were the key elements successfully played out on film.

Richard Gere stars as Zack Mayo, a hardened, slightly rebellious loner who locked up his feelings and dared not get emotionally close to people. He had been hurt as a youth when his mother committed suicide and he went to live with his dad, who was a selfish womanizer and alcoholic. When Zack announced his acceptance into Naval candidacy school to become a pilot, his father did not give him accolades or support. This was nothing new and it did not matter to Zack who pursued his dream with determination and courage. At the Port Townsend Naval Base, Zack learned discipline and made new friends. The camaraderie of being candidates and challenging themselves to acheive their goals awakened something new within him which totally transformed him. Zack excelled in physical survival skills and martial arts training. It was Gunnery Sergeant Foley's job to detect weakness of character and courage, to eliminate candidates who would not survive under the harsh conditions of war. Foley knew of Zack's streetwise rebellious tendencies and rode him hard. Foley and Zack clashed periodically and one climactic scene especially stood out ... where Foley meted out severe discipline and punishment to get Zack to ask for a ""D.O.R"" slip (drop out on request). Zack endured the punishment and after a particularly difficult session of physical endurance tests, Zack *finally* gut wrenchingly admitted, ""I got nowhere else to go"" ...

Besides the obvious story about a group of young adults who under go rigorous training to become Naval pilots, several other stories arise and are fully developed within the plot which makes this film so highly appealing. Early on, Sgt Foley warned the candidates that young ladies who work in local factories, come from across the Puget Sound, to meet Naval candidates, with one goal in mind: to marry a Navy pilot. They will stoop to any means to win their man. Zack and his friend Sid are dressed to kill in their white uniforms during a social dance where they connect with two charming and beautiful factory workers of similar age to themselves. Paula a raven-haired beauty, played by Deborah Winger is paired with Zack, while Lynette, an attractive blond is paired with Sid. The attraction between the paired off guys and ladies is mutual and in a short time, they often meet for consensual physical liasons, even going to a local motel when the candidates are on leave. While everyone agrees it is with ""no strings attached"", the ladies have secret agendas with hopes of marriage. Zack attempts to play the gentleman, by going to meet Paula's parents and have dinner at their home. However, he still holds back and makes no promises to Paula. Paula plays it cool, claiming to expect nothing but she *does* manage to melt his cool exterior when their physical relationship becomes more steamy and personal. The guys discuss their plans to break off the liasons after graduation. As the end of their training is near, the two candidates cool their relationships with the two ladies. Lynette pulls a trick to win Sid, that backfires in ways totally unimaginable. She refuses Sid's engagement ring which results in one of the saddest, most gut-wrenching, heart-breaking and realistic scenes ever depicted on film. This earth-shattering event shakes Zack up and makes him realize what is real and important in his life ... While the ending may arguably be interpreted by some as corny and hokey, in effect, it is very satisfying and provides an honest and fulfilling conclusion to the film.

The one part that everyone seems to love is Deborah standing by the jukebox, desperately trying to act like she is not interested in Gere - was that great acting or what?  In the interviews behind the scenes with Richard he says he thought that the ending was too much - too unreal.  He was surprised once he saw it on film how it worked.  It does - it is a great movie in my opinion.

Gere stars as Zack Mayo, a rebellious loner who decides to enter the Navy's flight training program.  Suffering from the after-effects of his mother's suicide and life with an indifferent father, Zack decides that the Navy would make a good career choice.  Plus, he's always wanted to fly jets.

The first person Zack meets after arriving on base is Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr.).  Foley is a tough, hard-nosed drill instructor who takes nothing from recruits.  He pushes them both physically and mentally, but he wants the recruits to succeed.  During the course of the movie, Foley and Zack develop a somewhat rocky relationship, but each man respects the other.  Ultimately, Foley ends up playing a major role in Zack's life.

Also present is Sid Worley (David Keith), another officer candidate whom Zack befriends.  Together, the two meet two local girls: Paula (Debra Winger) and Lynette (Lisa Blount).  Foley cautioned the group about the local women and their desire to snag a husband, but Foley's warning didn't stop Zack and Sid.  Soon, the foursome is spending all of their available time together.  Zack and Paula begin to have feelings for each other, but Zack is reluctant to commit to her based on his past.  Meanwhile, Lynette and Sid's relationship has taken a different turn.  Sid is falling in love with Lynette, but she's not sure how she feels about him.  To complicate matters further, Lynette announces she's pregnant.  Unsure of what to do, Sid D.O.R.'s in the 12th week of training, hoping to marry Lynette and move back to Oklahoma.  However, Lynette has no intentions of marrying Sid, instead saying she wants to marry a pilot and live overseas.  Devastated, Sid leaves, and the upcoming consequences are terrible for all involved.

Zack and the rest of his class manage to survive Foley's training and graduate to the next step of their careers.  Along the way, Zack has learned the value of friendship and sacrificing personal gains in order to help others.  Zack and Paula's relationship has remained somewhat up in the air, but Zack goes to the factory where she works and carries her in his arms out the door, to the cheers of the other workers.

This is a very good movie.  Richard Gere is very good in his role as Zack, but the film really belongs to Louis Gossett, Jr.  His portrayal of the hard-nosed Foley is truly the highlight of the film.  The story is devised very well, too.  I enjoyed watching the relationship among Zack, Paula, Sid, and Lynette develop, and the story about the training the recruits went through is good as well.

I recommend this movie very highly.  The movie is rich and satisfying, and the moving performances will stay with you long after the movie has ended.",1203638400,2,2827,4.855648535564853

Eventhough it can be better, it really ""lift it up"" (no pun intended) to ""where it belong"" (again ... no pun intended).

It's a well acted movie with great characterisation by both the leading actors, Richard Gere and Louis Gosset Jr. You can really feel for the character. Debra Winger plays Gere love interest with casual ease. Meg Ryan played gere's partner, Goose briefly but effectively.

Overall, its one of the better romantic drama to have come out from Hollywood and Gere's best potrayal as a leading man.

239700,4,6300214222,"Overall a really beautiful movie. I love love stories, and this is one of those movies that comes along once in a blue moon. Richard Gere along with the supporting cast do such an excellent job in emotionally involving you in the story, that by the end you feel like you were there watching it all take place.

This is a movie for guys as much as it is for girls, because there is an action element as much as there is a romance element in the movie. I highly recommend it as its a feel good movie. The lovemaking scene is tastefully done, so it MAY not be a problem for you to watch with younger viewers. I watched this movie for the first time when i was 12 and i found that there was nothing erotic or vulgar about it.

The story takes off when an army brat Zach Mayo (richard gere) leaves his womanizing, alcholic father to, in his own way, follow in his footsteps by joining the marine corps, and to go on to be an officer. Here he meets Sid Worley (David Keith) and the two get along very well (but zach keeps his eye on the prize). During their training they meet two of the local girls; Paula Pokrifki (Debra winger) and Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount) two of many girls trying to land themselves an officer so that they can finally be rid of their low class lives of working in the local paper factory. Zach and Paula fall in love (even though zach does not show it). The story takes us into the brutal training that they go through in order to become officers, under the strict hand of Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.), who plays his part to a tee. Sid falls in love with Lynette and finds out that he gets her pregnant. This together with the pressures of boot camp makes sid give up and quit, only to find out that things aren't what they seem. It drives him to do things and this makes Zach build up higher and stronger walls around himself alienating himself from Lynette. After graduation he realises that without her, he is nothing and he goes to get her back. Here follows one of the most famous scenes in movie making history when he walks into the paper factory and carries Lynette out with the song ""love lift us up where we belong"" playing in the background.

Last say: A good buy. A good adition to a collection. A classic.",1191715200,2,2258,4.283372365339578
239701,5,6300214222,"""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is hands down one of the most romantic films to come out in the 90's. Though the premise is one often seen from Hollywood, ""Officer"" is a rich and often sad romantic journey filled with raw emotions and powerful performances by everyone involved. It is truly a well written (Douglas Day Stewart), well directed story (Taylor Hackford) with an all-star cast and it proves it!

 Zach Mayo, played by Richard Gere, is an adorably rebellious, often charming, and cocky Navy brat who enters the Naval Academy with hopes of become a pilot. Almost immediately, he clashes with drill Sgt. Foley, his immediate commanding officer played by Louis Gossett, Jr.. While learning about teamwork, friendship, and fitting in, his life is rapidly complicated by a local factory worker, Paula, (played by Academy Award Winner Debra Winger) looking to find an attractive young officer with a promising future and a way out of town. The film alternates between Gere's progress at the Academy, his ability to be a loyal friend and his blossoming romance. For a while it seems unlikely that either will work out longterm. It's a classic story of over-coming adversity, struggling to do the right thing, and learning to make the right decisions to become a better person. It comes across as very true-to-life and believable with tremendously real performances!

  Breathtakingly believable as a selfish, angry and somewhat lost young man, Richard Gere takes us on a roller coaster ride of character development that is stunningly real. I was honestly surprised he didn't receive a nomination for best actor for this performance, hands down one of his best to date. Debra Winger was nominated for Best Supporting Actress while Lou Gossett, Jr. won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the dunting drill sergeant who manages to make a real man and an officer out of Zach Mayo. David Keith in the role of Sid Worley, Zach' best friend, also shines in a moving and ultimately heart breaking performance of his own. Rounding out the cast, Lisa Blount in the role of Paula's white trash best friend did a formidable job of conveying the utter desperation and hopelessness that leads a certain type of woman to do whatever it takes to marry up in life.

  ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is an intense romance/drama filled with a chemistry seldom seen with such startling realism (despite the supposed conflict between Gere & Winger off camera). The energy and sexual intensity are exactly what great romance is made of. It will make you laugh, make you cry, make you angry and make you sigh. And by the time you reach the end, it will have you cheering. Will anyone who has seen it ever forget the moment Zach sweeps Paula into his arms and marches her out of that humdrum factory life to live happily ever after?

Richard Gere embodies the character of Zack Mayo, a troubled young man who, due to neglect and ill parenting by a military father, signs up with the Navy to get some direction in his misguided life.

Richard Gere is great in adding layers to what could have been a poorly drawn characterisation. Mayo is not always the 'good guy' and is more often than not a complete prick.
This movie shows what a person can accomplish when they believe in themselves and have a big brother who cares enough to make them succeed. This is a great movie.",1187049600,,745,4.391304347826087

Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) joins the Navy in his hope to become a fighter pilot, where he is constantly challenged , both mentally and physically by the drill sergeant, brilliantly played by Louis Gossett Jr. While this battle is fought out between Gere and Gossett Jr., there is also a sub-plot to the film - that being the friendship with fellow candidate, David Keith. However, the story is strengthened by the powerful relationship that Gere develops with Debra Winger, who plays the part of a factory worker with nuance and vividness, that one marvels at he acting skill.

There is a lot of pathos in this film, which creates emotional responses from the viewer. But there also some fantastic uplifting moments. The soundtrack adds to these moments of joy, and by the end of the movie we feel we have purged our pathos, and we believe in the power of love and remember those that made a difference in our lives.",1177113600,4,1081,4.654450261780105

  I recently purchased the video from Amazon to be reminded of a movie that haunts every female blue collar worker in the USA and I was not dissapointed at the repeat reminder.yet I dare say maybe embarrased at how Raw Richard Gere displays himself in this gem of a romantic.

  From the beginning you realize that Gere is a force to be reckoned and what a wonderful force he turned out to be.

  If you ever doubted what Gere is capable of this is a good reminder. From one of the most Powerful demoralizing scenes of a Lead Actor ,too the dramatic ending where as always he steals your heart. The last scene of the movie could still sell a million posters.

  Ohh...and Winger? What happened to that chick. She was blazing through the 70's and the 80's. I really am not sure if any other actress could have made this film any more powerful  than her portrayel in this film. From a steamy Sex Scene as incredibly intimate as it is, was, I say one of the most daring of its time and just when you think they fouled it up Winger and Gere prove beyond doubt they know what their doing. Once again making cinema magic.

  With the advance in the industry and the newer films on the market and the older gems that are still revered An Officer and A Gentleman Has Its place.

  For me it was more than a movie it was a vision, a hope and a possibility.

  Yea....the movie turned out better, but ,after my recent re-viewing....It is really good that it did.

  I hope you will add this to your collection. Do not be surprised if you feel almost embarrased for Gere if you have followed his career. I admit the first 16 minutes were a little hard to swallow only because he has soared so high in his occupation and realizing in some way this might be one he would want to forget...only because it is a part of him that he is probably not as in touch with as of current....i.e. 1970's and 2005 but damn he still looks just as HOT....you lucky girl Carey.(His Real-Life Spouse)

The movie follows Richard Gere as ""Zack Mayo"" who joins the Navy and goes through Officer Candidate School. Along the way, he learns the meaning of friendship, discipline, and love.
The beginning has a very poignant episode of flashbacks going back to ""Mayo's"" childhood, his father's treatment of him, and his harsh upbringing. It is through this upbringing, that you begin to understand why ""Mayo"" acts the way he does through the first half of the movie.
The friendship between he and David Keith is a special one, one that tests its very meaning. Debra Winger does an excellent job of a local factory girl, looking to find someone special. Along comes the smooth talking, loner ""Mayo"" who is hell-bent on completing Officer Candidate School without anyone's help. Their chemistry is magical.
Louis Gossett Jr. is the senior drill instructor who tests ""Mayo's"" committment and perserverance. Gosstt Jr. is ""Foley"" who's job is to weed out those who don't belong and he does a phenomenal portrayal of that.
Some of my favorite scenes were with Gere and Winger at the ""Tides Inn"", Gere and Gosset Jr. in the blimp hanger, and the latter half of the film with Gere's changing of character.

I always think he is a very good actor, not just handsome man. However, his gift is his charisma. His acting makes you believe that he is the most attractive man ever, and the woman he is in love with is the luckiest. He makes Debra Winger shine, just like he later did with Julia Roberts in Pretty Women. Not that Debra Winger is not great, she is very talented with the most radiant smile. The on screen chemistry between them is one that is hard to find nowadays.

The story is about Zack Mayo (Richard Gere in arguably his best film role to date), a recent college graduate who wants to get away from his skirt-chasing father. His mother committed suicide when Zack was rather young, and ever since then he has lived with his father and therefore, has an attitude problem and a difficult time trusting people. When he enrolls in the Navy where he meets his match, his drill instructor (played by Oscar winner Louis Gosset Jr.) who teaches him, maybe not in the most pleasant way, dicipline and that no man can survive alone. Zack knows how to get things, which lands him into trouble with his drill instructor but refused to D.O.R.. His determination keeps him in school. At a party, he and his first real friend Sid (played by David Keith in his breakthrough and Golden Globe nominated role) meet two friends, Paula (played to her first of three Oscar nominations, the amazing Debra Winger) and Lynette (played by Lisa Blount, in her Golden Globe nominated role).

I strongly agree with anyone who says that Richard Gere should have gotten an Oscar (or at least a nomination) for his role. Debra Winger earned herself a well-deserved Oscar nomination, but it was obvious that Meryl Streep was going to win.

Because of Foley's mind manipulations, Zack learns a little bit about being a better person. He also meets a good friend at the navy. And, he meets a girl walking past the naval camp whom he thinks is hot. The girl, Paula (played excellently by Debra Winger) sees Zack again at a party, and the two hook up. First, they like each other in a cute way, and a sex-related way, but the passion they feel for each other escalates into a meaningful relationship. The ending is uplifting and romantically brilliant! An ultimate fantasy of happiness and love. The musical score perfectly fits the mood, and the original song played during the ending credits, ""Up Where We Belong"", by Joe Cocker, is lovely. I highly recommend ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", a film that teaches about friendships, loss, perseverance, and love. ""Way to go, Paula, way to go!!""",1046390400,3,1340,4.8304347826086955
239999,5,6300214222,"I love movies as this. Movies that suggest valuable life lessons (even if they are cheesy).

Richard Gere acts as if he is the consummate low-life-user-loser (not as low however as his father, played as if it was natural for him by Robert Loggia), until he experiences numerous maturation lessons in the serious game we call life.

What makes this movie (and all similarly toned movies for that matter), kitschy is that they distill the melodramatic moments of life in the span of a few hours of a movie.

Louis Gossett, Jr. won an Academy Award for a one of a kind portrayal of the disciplinarian drill instructor who falters at times dealing with ""Mayonnaise"". Brilliant, masterful acting on the part of Mr. Gossett.

Taylor Hackford does a magnificent job of drawing out the inherent skills of all players, Debra Winger, David Keith, Lisa Blount, Lisa Eilbacher et al, directing them to convey to the audience the writers intent. Magnificent story and perhaps wisdom gleaned from a movie.",1029974400,5,991,4.880952380952381
240000,5,6300214222,"This is an amazing movie.  Gere delivers a very dramatic performance which thoroughly convinced me, and the set-up is realistic and believable.  The romance lightens the plot up some, but it's not the main point, which concentrates on growth and friendship, and how important friends are to human beings.  A great movie.

It's also fun to see stars like David Caruso before anyone knew who David Caruso was.  I also enjoyed the DVD commentary by director Taylor Hackford, who's looking back on the movie after 20 years.  A simply great DVD all around.",1020988800,,404,4.728571428571429

Despite its pro-military theme, the movie was made without the assistance or support of the military.  The military apparently thought cadences running around singing about napalming babies might give the public the wrong idea of what the military is about.

240003,5,6300214222,"It's worth owning this excellent film, and sitting all the way through it, to hear the final line -- Lynette, congratulating her best friend (Debra Winger):  ""Way to go, Paula!""
Recalling that upbeat cheer has helped me through many difficult times in my life, romantic troubles, financial difficulties, career woes, various diseases and injuries.  All it takes for me to get a grip, snap out of it and take the high ground is to look at myself in the mirror, pretend to be Lynette, and shout, ""Way to go, Paula!""
I used to feel this way about ""Atta boy, Luther!"" from The Ghost and Mr. Chicken -- but ""Way to go, Paula!"" is infinitely more inspiring.  Enjoy it, live it, thrive on it:  Way to go, Paula!!",1004486400,7,705,4.52755905511811

Excellent performance by Louis Gossett, Jr. (who, it was said, back in 1982 when this movie was released, totally disassociated himself from the rest of the cast as part of the preparation for his role as Gunnery Sergeant Foley - and it worked, he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor).

But Mayo manages to shake off his selfishness and he learns to love-not only deb Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger), but his new best friend Sid Worley (David Keith).

7805568,5,6300214222,"This is a classic love story movie that my wife and I love. It features an excellent cast that really makes this movie exceptional. It is a story about a young man that wants to become a Naval Officer and go to flight school to become an aviator. His wild background and troubled family life makes it difficult for him to remain in control of his emotions and anger.

The area around the naval training base has a lot of young women the would love to get their hands on a Naval Aviator and marry them. Anything to get out of working in the local paper mills and to live the life of being married to an officer in the military.

The officer school is difficult in order to weed out the weak applicants that cannot become a pilot or a military officer and leader. A tough Sergeant, Emil Foley, has the job of hammering the young recruits into physical, mental shape and having the proper attitude to become an officer.

This was a showcase film for Richard Greer, Debra Winger and Lou Gossett JR that helped make their careers. I loved the film and I have watched it multiple times. It is one of my favorites.",1523750400,2,1107,4.338164251207729
