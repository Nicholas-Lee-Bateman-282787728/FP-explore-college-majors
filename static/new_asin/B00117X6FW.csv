8679374,2,B00117X6FW,"As a cyclocross fan, racer and pretty big Jeremy Power's fan, I figured this DVD was a no brainer. Boy was I ever wrong! Here is the actual breakdown of the content of the video:

60% - video from cx races in the north east shot by 1 camera
20% - horrible video of amateur host and corny jokes (think high school video project)
20% - interview with jpow covering some interesting and some boring stuff

I was hoping, based on the title for it to be 100% jpow, but he didn't make an appearance until about 35 minutes in and it was him discussing his car and current roommate situation. Pre-race rituals and some training insight would be been easily 5 stars, but none of that here

Don't buy, unless you want an expensive, shiny coaster.",1384387200,,736,4.357664233576642
