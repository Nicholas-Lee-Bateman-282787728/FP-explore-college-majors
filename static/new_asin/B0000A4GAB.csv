7995729,2,B0000A4GAB,"This is a spoof of African-American culture and slang. During a party someone in a Jason mask seems to appear at will and kill people. It is not much of a slasher or horror as it is a comedy.  In one scene we see a man with his throat slit screaming for help and a cigarette. Not as good or forward as ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"" but done in a similar vein. Worth passing up for most people.

7995730,1,B0000A4GAB,Worst horror film ever. Killer is stupid. Just boring. Not being racist but usually all films with all black ppl are really cheap. But!!!!the movie jacked up is amazing. Go look it up. Great story. Great acting. Incredible,1263513600,,222,4.868421052631579
7995731,1,B0000A4GAB,"....this is just a terrible waste of time. I have sat through some of the worst movies, but this is on a whole different level. I challange anyone to watch this straight through without getting bored out of your mind and having to get up. I love a bad slasher movie as much as the next derelict, but this is just a terrible excuse for a film.

Before the opening credits some 'homies' are passing out flyers for a house party. A big white guy who thinks he's down says the N word and the bruthas beat and kick him to death, or so they think. The house party ends up being host to a 'home invasion' for a fat guy wearing a 99 cent glow in the dark K-Mart hockey mask.

The only halfway entertaining part of this movie is the unique style of CPR performed by Sistah Gurl. Someone should have told her it was mouth to mouth and not mouth to, oh you know what I mean. I wonder if she really was blowing. As much potential as the idea for this scene had, it was done poorly.

The director obviously has no idea what he is doing and ended up with a hodgepodge movie that is obviously loosely held together by an over simplified plot. If you like bad movies, God bless you, but take it from a veteran bad film buff. This is NOT a 'so bad it's good' or 'so bad it's entertaining' film. This is a 'so bad I can't believe I paid five dollars for this and I can't get rid of it on eBay or the Pawn Shop, so I'll either throw it away or it will sit in the back of my closet and never see the light of day again' movies.",1143072000,2,1507,3.9834437086092715
7995732,2,B0000A4GAB,"This was a very odd movie. I found myself cracking up simply because of the horrible effects and feeling sick simply because of an ""intimate"" scene between a living female and a dead male. I had to stop the film halfway through because I started to feel stupid and not to mention..dirty. I'll be generous and give this movie two stars only because it did allow me to giggle and crack up a few times just because it was so stupid. Who's redbone?",1142208000,,444,4.36144578313253
7995733,1,B0000A4GAB,"This movie is complete garbage from start to finish.  The writer does do a good job of making you hate all of the main characters, although im not sure if that is intentional.  Everyone in this movie is racist, except the white guy.  Everyone refers to white people as krackers very freely throughout the entire movie.  Also, there is no payoff.  I could possibly live with the racism if they all got brutally slaughtered, but the few kills are very badly done.  I know this is low budget, but they could have put some effort into the deaths.  Stay very far away from this one, even if you love b-movie horror like i do.",1112054400,3,620,4.385964912280702
7995734,5,B0000A4GAB,"If I could give this movie 25 stars instead of just 5, then I would do it quicker than you can say ""My bellybutton itches.""  This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves Speilberg in the dust.  The acting, combined with the beautiful camera-work, creates a truly educational and comedic experience.  I'm tall. The movie just makes me all my emotions flow out of me it is truly masterful. every moment in life i yearn to watch this movie. it makes me splooge.  Still have doubts?  Think ""Cujo"" meets ""The Wash"".  I'm still trembling from the hot tub scene.  What's my name?  WORK IT...kool aid red HOLLA",1092009600,3,607,4.607476635514018
7995735,1,B0000A4GAB,"ok, granted, it's absolutely awful, the worst movie i have ever seen on any and all levels of moviemaking. HOWEVER, you really need to watch the whole thing, because it simply boggles the mind how bad this thing is. at the end, as your brain slowly melts out your ears, you'll thank me.",1078185600,2,286,4.415094339622642
7995736,1,B0000A4GAB,"I couldn't even get through the first twenty minutes because they were mind-numbing.  Clumsily shot, horribly lit, and terribly acted.  And this coming from a man who loves cheesy b movies.  This isn't even a B movie.  Nor a C movie.  Or a D movie for that matter.  God, please avoid and do not blame me if you have morbid curiosity.",1067644800,2,333,4.377049180327869
