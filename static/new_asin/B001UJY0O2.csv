4097066,2,B001UJY0O2,"While some of the locations and information offered are very interesting, the production value of this documentary leaves a lot to be desired. It is almost painful to watch at times, and in fact, I didn't even finish watching it for this reason. There is a lot of footage that is unnecessary, and much of it is without soundtrack or dialogue. It might be worth watching for the locations provided and the associated information, but this is definitely not a professional production by any means!",1431388800,2,495,4.8352941176470585

4097101,4,B001UJY0O2,Simon Brown is an adventure like the rest of us.  What makes him better than that is that he actually gets up off the sofa and goes out and explores great bible mysteries with friiends and family and what ever movie camera they've got to do it with.,1447113600,,249,4.1875
4097102,5,B001UJY0O2,"Like others said, not professionally produced, edited, acted, scripted, not the best video quality, we could pick it apart all day long.

4097108,5,B001UJY0O2,"but God's word to men.  This Documentary provides historical evidence reconfirming the truth of the Bible. Although filmed and produced evidently with a small group, it is very interesting to those who like to feel they are experiencing a visit with a friend who is sharing his recent trip to Israel & Jordan.",1439337600,2,309,4.830188679245283
4097109,5,B001UJY0O2,"Dear friends, thank you for watching this film, I Simon Brown produced. But please understand, I am not a film producer, and have never made any films until this one.

And yes I am an amateur, who produced this film on a zero budget, out of my own pocket, which was my own research, in hope to present the truth, which was only intended to do for friends.

I was not expecting this film to be sold, and played so much on sky TV.
Yet I am truly grateful and humbled and hope it has still inspired you in some way.

Under the circumstances I would like to give myself 5 stars, not for the quality of the film, but for my desire to help you know the truth of the Bible, in hope to help you take that next step of faith towards Jesus and be saved.

I hope you will see the rest of my latest films are now more professional.

May God bless you.

 Simon Brown.

8392183,1,B001UJY0O2,"Simon Brown is ""full of it"".  I spent 5 yrs in Israel, this film is very poor in all areas. He isn't an archaeologist, he isn't even a good tour guide. And for his real discoveries....he hasn't discovered anything.  All that about Sadom and Gormorah is speculation on his part, not an ounce of fact.",1508025600,,299,4.418181818181818

As another viewer stated, since I don't plan to travel to these places myself, it was a real gift to get to see the Holy Land.  And, it provides proof that the  Bible is not just illustrious fables.  I want my friends and family to see the sulfur balls from Gomorrah!  Thanks, Simon, I enjoyed it so much!",1460764800,,447,4.127906976744186
