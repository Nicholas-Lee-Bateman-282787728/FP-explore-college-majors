695469,5,6303614272,"Brown is back with his camera, capturing the essence of surfing in an hour-and-a-half film.  Robert August is back, too, as a surfboard manufacturer and weekend surfer.  This time Brown's got two new surfers for  the trip, a classic longboarder and a young rip-roaring shortboarder. We  also get treated to some great demonstrations of bodysurfing, bodyboarding,  parasurfing, and windboarding.  We even have a WW-2 vintage Grumman Goose  ""surfing"" the rivers of South America (though it looks more like  a crash to me).
Fans of the original will enjoy the sequel, though I  prefer the clean cut, laid-back style of the sixties surfers rather than  the adreneline-junkie style of the modern surfers.  Still, its a good  treatment of both styles, and the film does a good job of showing all forms  of surfing.  I especially like the brief history of surfboard design the  Brown gives at the beginning of the film.  Redwood boards? They must've  been quite a load!
Along with improvements in surfboard design, this film  also benefits from improvements in camera technology.  The underwater and  low-water shots are fantastic, really getting you in the action.  This is  a fantastic movie for those rainy days just before Spring.",921456000,2,1227,5.090909090909091

695707,3,6303614272,This was very self-consciously an attempt to resurrect the lighthearted tone and style and situations of the original. I did find the obviously set-up supposedly antic or risky situations a bit annoying -- of course strategically-placed multiple cameras just happen to be carefully placed when some goofy thing or remark happens. It feels a little too scripted and thus forced for my tastes. But the waves and cinematography are often gorgeous.,1418342400,,444,5.267605633802817

695782,5,6303614272,"Endless Summer II truly exhibits what people with great attitudes and adventurous spirits can accomplish in their lives.  This story of two young men following the surf around the world is timeless, because it showcases the best qualities in people:  positive thinking, friendship, hospitality, courage, humor, humility, and a deep love and respect of this planet we call home.  The locations are wrought with indescribable beauty.  The narration is honest, smooth, and without ego.  The storyline is simple, clean, and fun, but also sparks child-like curiosity in a viewer.  The friendships shared are pure and heartwarming to experience.  It is a film that I have watched over and over and it still makes me smile and feel the warmth of an endless summer.  It does not belong on the rack with the other DVDs; it rests upon my coffee table.

695783,5,6303614272,A very fun movie. Great photography through out the film. Good action with a great adventure story to go with it. I highly recommend this film to anyone.,1378339200,,153,4.5

695785,5,6303614272,"It's a clever and humorous documentary, and sequel, where 2 guys go about the world chasing the best waves.
I bought the VHS tape back in the 1990s and wore that tape OUT.  I now have the Laserdisc of it, and have never seen a DVD for it. I didn't know the DVD existed until now.  If you love surfing and humor, you will love this movie. Be warned, there are parts you don't want young children seeing if you are selective about modesty (women on foreign beaches that go topless).
This movie is a must-have for any collector of Surfing and/or comedy.",1370044800,,550,4.330097087378641

695944,5,6303614272,I like this video better than the original Endless Summer. Both are classic's and should be in your surf movie collection. Both movie's raised the bar when they were made. Love the narritive and the variety of people and sights along the way as the surfers travel around the globe. I expect someone will eventually make a Endless Summer III. A movie this good deserves to be updated every generation or so.,1344211200,,406,4.652777777777778
695945,5,6303614272,"This summer in Ireland we saw a remake of Endless Summer, the guys no longer in their first youth, but still agile and daring.
And we thought, hey, the movie has to be on DVD.
Indeed it is, and loses nothing when translated to the big screen, and viewed while sprawled in air-conditioned comfort.
Still beautiful, forever adventurous, forever young.
Us, too.
Original, and extra crispy, both a pleasant revisitation.

695947,4,6303614272,"This is a great surf movie and has lots of supreme footage. I especially enjoyed the footage taken in the water; it makes you feel like you are right in the waves with them! I would warn everyone that there is a scene at a nude beach in France, which is something I definitely didn't expect when I bought it, seeing that it was rated PG.",1245974400,,337,4.121212121212121
695948,5,6303614272,"I found this sequel much better than the more-famous ""Endless Summer"" which had been made 30 years before this film. That was good, no doubt, but this is far better and a big reason is better camera lenses and techniques. The only ""bummer"" is that the DVD sharpness wasn't much better than the VHS.  I wound up selling my disc and keeping my VHS tape.

The photography in here is spectacular and I'm not a fan of surfing but this is amazing footage....and who isn't awed by huge waves? The camera puts you inside and underneath some of these mammoth waves and they aren't just spectacular; they are beautiful.

As in the first film, the narration and the travelogue is interesting and humorous. Bruce Brown, the man who narrated both films, is consistently entertaining in this area as he navigates us to distant countries and islands. We see, for example, the beaches of Australia, France, Fiji, Alaska, Indonesia, Africa, on and on - just magnificent scenery.

Also featured are wild animals, poisonous reptiles, a topless beach and assorted other goodies. It also was interesting to see familiar faces from the mid- 1960s movie and see how they've aged.

It all makes the 110-minute film interesting for anyone, surfers or not.",1234137600,,1230,4.838095238095238

696060,5,6303614272,If you are a surfer than the endless summer series is required viewing and for good reason. Reminds the old surfers of their stoke and inspires the Groms. Even if you aren't a surfer this is one fine piece of cinema with classic Bruce Brown narration. Nothing beats the original.,1232668800,,279,4.6

696062,5,6303614272,"It is hard to improve on the original, but this DVD comes real close.  Any surf film can show good waves, but what separates ES II is Bruce Brown's narrative (reminiscent of ES), the characters, and how this movie flows.  There is enough non-surf events going off that it stays fresh from start to finish.

Add this one to the collection, and hope that the formats don't change too soon.",1214784000,,387,4.5
696063,5,6303614272,"I've made it a personal tradition to watch this movie during spring break each year throughout high school.  It always gets me excited about summer.  I HIGHLY recommend this film for anybody who loves to travel to new places.  The guys in this film have the opportunity to go to several exotic places that most people wouldn't even consider for vacationing.  But each place has its own charm and appeal, and the surfers are able to have a blast wherever they end up.

Great film all around.  Awesome surfers, awesome waves, awesome producer.  Simple as that.",1206403200,,558,4.75
696064,4,6303614272,"This film follows a meandering path of a few dudes attempting to get ""stoked"" while riding waves on various continents. It combines surfing, humor, nature, beauty, and cool. You might even get stoked while watching it & take a trip down the beach. The film rarely takes itself seriously and instead, gives a light side of surfing entertainment. It's my favorite surf film (I have about a dozen).

Rent or buy this film for the content, not the quality. If the quality was there it would rate as 5+ stars.

Please note; don't waste your time or money on another film called ""The Endless Summer Revisited"". It's a discredit to have ""Revisited"" associated with this film.",1181606400,,668,4.75

I have not seen the first/original, but find the underwater camera work almost symphonic in its composition, as well as almost reverent in its treatment of the ocean, landscape, cultures and peoples encountered.

Further, the surfers are a delight to watch--antics and skills alike.

Though I have never gotten on a surfboard, even on land, this movie makes me long to ride the waves and go to each and every destination that I have not been to.

My dream vacation would be Tavarula island...thanks in no small part to Wingnut!",1136073600,,555,4.75

696186,4,6303614272,"This film is the epitome of surf films. Bruce Brown is the standard in  which anyone who makes a surf film should be measured to. Great Cinematogrophy, great camera angles, great sufers to make the main charachters. Robert ""wingnut"" Weaver, and Pat O'connel are a perfect pair to make someone want to go out, and brave the treacherous ocean for that rush of adrenaline, joy, and most of all an ear to ear smile.

When I put the DVD in my cheap-o Mintek player (my Sony player finally gave up the ghost) it just loops endlessly through the FBI Warning, the Monterey Media Splash screen and the Movie Splash screen.  This way, I get to see over and over again exactly who the incompetent folks are who are responsible for this sad adaptation to DVD format!  Monterey Media!  Hooray!
I am only able to get to the root menu by pressing the ""MENU"" button at *exactly* the right moment during this looping.
The root menu has two links that go to the same Special Features screen, which is silly and confusing.  And the ""Scene Access"" link just takes me to that same Special Features screen!  LOL
However, the movie itself plays just fine, with good sound and picture quality.  And there are three Special Feature shows of about 20 minutes each that had some cool stuff in them, although again, production quality was pretty sad.

PLUS, it doesn't tell you if it is in Dolby Digital or 5.1, etc.. This leads me to assume it is in momo which would be a huge dissapointment considering that the soundtrack is as good as the movie and goes hand in hand. WHY does Montery Video AVOID stating what format and sound the dvd has? This is rediculous in my opinion and I will avoid buying this dvd untill I know what it is like from other reviews. If you ask me this is bad business practices by Montery Video and the Brown family should've chosen a better more professional company to release all their dvd with. ""Endless Summer"" the original was a dissapointment on dvd also. Non-widscreen and not remastered. All Bruce Brown dvds are done this way and a huge dissapointment in my opinion. Especially because I am a huge fan of all his movies. Hopefully someday they will re-release the dvd movies professionally instead of saving a buck. They won't get my money untill they do.

696322,4,6303614272,"My how things change from the 1960s to the 1990s! The boards are smaller, the fashions more elaborate, the girls-well they are still sexy- and seem to have reduced their clothing somewhat-and the waves have gotten bigger, meaner and hollower. Something else has also changed in surfing-money. There is plenty of it here-surf boats, surf camps, professional surfers (what are they?, -I hear the voices of the 1960s echo- Getting paid to surf?, surely not!), and charter planes. Well, the film was well financed, but the average surfers these days have more of these options as well.
In Endless Summer 2, places visited in the original 1966 film include only a few: eg South Africa-Cape St Francis, and West Africa-except that its Elands Bay this time and Namibia, not the Ivory Coast area and Senegal(?), as in the 1966 film. Most of the places are, however, new ones, as the best surf spots in the world have mostly been discovered since the original film was made.
In this film we get to see good quality surf in: Fiji (Tavarua and Restaurants), Indonesia (Grajagan of course), Hawaii, Elands Bay and J-Bay (very good 6 foot surf), and Cape St Francis (all South Africa), (note: if you are ever in South Africa don't miss Kitchen Windows (in my experience its under-rated) and 'Jungenfentein' (or something like that)), several in Central America (I'm not familiar with these spots, but they are near Panama I think). They also go to France and Australia, but the surf doesn't oblige when they did the filming in these two places.
It is particularly a pity for the Australian segment, where they didn't get much surf, as they went to some of the best surf spots in Australia on the north coast of NSW (eg Lennox, Angourie, Cabarita, Broken Head), and southern Queensland (eg Snapper, Burleigh, Kirra). (The last 3 times I have been to these areas I have got 6 foot surf each time-must have been lucky).
Overall a fun and interesting expose of world surf culture in the 1990s, with some of the better-known world surf spots, and a bit of humour and some very good quality surf thrown in, especially at Grajagan (G-land), Tavarua, and my favourite-J-Bay.",1019088000,31,2153,4.790322580645161
696323,5,6303614272,"Know what I did the other day?  Woke up with the theme song from Endless Summer in my head.
It was snowing up and down the east coast, so I popped in Endless Summer II (on VHS - still waiting for that DVD), turned up the heat, cracked open a couple Coronas with my roommate, and instantly was back in the sun, on the beach, in the kind of place where deeply spiritual connection to people and place combines with waves and nice looking girls in bikinis (or less if you're in Biaritz, Fr.), the kind that only comes from surfing.
The thing about this movie: it puts you there through the footage, the people themselves, the locations, and of course, the great music.  Being from Dana Point, CA, this is nice not only in January, but anytime I'm not there in person.
The thing I really love about the film is how it remains true to its original roots: too guys travel the world surfing low budget style; one's a brash, outspoken blond, the other dark-haired, more reserved but equally stoked.  This time around, it's Pat O'Connell from Dana Point, CA, and Robert ""Wingnut"" Weaver from Santa Cruz.  This masterpiece of surfing video -- in a time when many think surfing videos are considered bland, recycled delivery mechanisms for punk bands and spoiled surf-brats -- is a breath of fresh air anytime, anywhere.  I think the commentary and participation in this one by the likes of Jerry Lopez, Shane Matthews, crazy Laird Hamilton, Kelly Slater, Tommy Curren, Walter the Zulu, and others makes it really special, since they show us how different surfers can be and still retain such kinship and passion for the ocean.  What could be more fittingly ironic than Pat and Wingnut tromping over the same dunes at Cape St. Francis that Mike and Robert did 30 years before to find luxury homes, but still some great waves, only a few miles from Jeffries Bay?  Add to that the innocent and inspiring surfing of 5 year old TJ Barron of HI and you've got not only something for surfers, but something for anybody.
Bruce Brown has always been lauded for his colorful, witty, tongue-in-cheek humor, and this is no exception (though it is exceptional).  He's also an innovator in the field of capturing the beauty and essence of surfing and the ocean itself on film.  The underwater scenes in Fiji and elsewhere are truly beautiful, and the soundtrack fits together with what's going on onscreen better than Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon with the Wizard of Oz.  The footage of Wingnut's footwork and amazing -- I mean truly genious -- moves on his longboard (shaped by ES I surfer and legend August) in any conditions are unparalleled.  Pat's surfing was so great at that time many thought he was really headed from greatness, and it shows in the shots.  And let's not forget the side-footage of the places themselves: the people, the ecology, and of course, the food, the last of which is a huge part of the surf experience.  You'll know what I mean when you check out the South Afica experience part with John Whitmore.
Thanks be to Bruce, Wingnut, Pat, and all the others involved in shooting and being in Endless Summer II.  You've provided the surf culture and the world at large with a gem: true to Endless Summer I, true to the way things are now, mindful of the past, living in the present, stoked for the future.
Now watch the movie and go surfing!",1011830400,8,3348,4.595637583892618
696324,5,6303614272,"The sequel to ""The Endless Summer"" has much better surf footage than the original and I think that the soundtrack is a tad better than the first as well...but both movies are excellent...makes you wonder when they will do ""The Endless Summer 3"" !!!

I could have saved a bundle if I'd just purchased it the first day. I made a joke about putting it on a loop so it would never go off. I did not tire of having it on because the music is pleasant, the narration smooth, charactors likable and the scenery & surfing breathtaking. We've since purchased a couple of copies each of Endless Summer 1 and 2 (along with movie posters). The boys are 16 and 19 now and we still love the videos. One son took a special detour to Biaritz France, just to see where they surfed.",1010361600,4,686,4.088888888888889
696326,5,6303614272,"Endless Summer II is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen! If you are into surfing, or even if your not, CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT! It is well worth your time and is the best surfing movie ever. I have been surfing for four years and this movie perfectly conveys the emotions, sights and sounds of surfing. Excellent sound and music, A+ cinematography, some of the best scenery caught on a surfing movie ever, and some of the most influential surfers in the world such as Pat O'Connel and Robert Weaver ever to grace a surfing movie, make this movie a definate keeper.

696327,5,6303614272,"No other surf video has caught the soul of surfing like ES II!  Of course it has unbelievable surf footage...it also has unbelievable surfers...then you add in the adventure of an around the world trip...but the thing that makes this movie special is it captures the passion that we as surfers have for the awesome power and majesty of the ocean.  Any video can show some nifty moves that the beachcomber would be blown away by...but here for all to see is unveiled a small glimpse into the unique world of the surfer.  Here, unveiled, is a peek at what drives each one of us to paddle back out to the break, day after day, and what makes surfing the most spectacular, addicting, adrenaline pumping sport in the world!  Anyone from a 3 decade veteran to a Kansas farmer will enjoy this landmark movie.
ES II follows 2 surfers from cali as they make their quest for the endless summer around the world.  Along the way they visit costa rica, france, africa, australia, and s.pacific.  Their are huge days at jaws in Hawaii, cold days in Alaska, never ending waves at jeffries in S.Africa...all topped off by a bear encounter, a croc chase, and some class 5 rapids.  If you want adventure than this is your movie.  If you want beautiful photography than once again this is for you.  Great movie!  Don't miss it!",996537600,,1308,4.551282051282051
696453,5,6303614272,This is a very good movie with some excellent surfing footage with both long and short boards. The movie does a great job of capturing the same feeling of the original 1964 movie with a more modern updated feel. I really appreciated the shortboard footage in this movie along with the humorous narration. This movie is a must-own if you are a surfer or anyone that appreciates the soul and art of the sport.,992476800,,407,4.513513513513513

It will take you a away and put you in a better place all while sitting in your favorite recliner. I don't care if it's a cold and gray  day in January, you will want to go surfing so bad after watching this movie or atleast go wax your board!
Push play, grab a cold beer, and sit back and let Endless Summer 2 Take you away. Finally a way to dream again.

The ugly is all those  amateur movie  reviewers, myself included.  However, most don't know the true (behind the  scenes)  production and post-production struggles between the surfers  involved in the project and the funding & distribution company, which  suffocated many talents. There was some pain involved. Yet despite all the  struggles, an incredible and entertaining 35mm surf documnetary was made,  and should be seen all.",963705600,,593,5.247311827956989

Bruce Brown did a tremendous job putting together a surfing  adventure which holds your interest from one end of the globe to the other.  Balancing a number of today's different surf styles, we're offered  everything from short boards to long boards to power surfing.  The film is  enriched with a wide variety of music, coupled with incredibly clear and  well positioned camera shots.  Add some of the best surfers in the world  and you've got a 5 star surf film.

Then the summer after I graduated from High School and 30 years after the original this was finally released!  I still believe it was the dream of ever true waterman that they would be the next Robert or Mike, sans suits when flying.

The second movie was wonderful and worth the wait.  Again, I just wish it could have been me instead of Wingnut.  It is still great family fun, just be careful of the French beach scene's,. Trying to explain to your 4, 8, or any age son (or daughter) why it's perfectly fine for the ladies to not wear anything on their top.

Endless Summer 2 is more fun and relevant though in my opinion because it shows many of the different types of surfing  incl. kayaking in waves, Laird Hamilton windsurfing in waves, and a young Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach ripping already in Tavarua and riding a standing wave in Texas,  before he became the Michael Jordan of surfing and one of the main developers of 2018s wave pool... Boogie boards, standing waves, body-surfing, Hawaiian outriggers, long and short boarding styles contrasted in the main 2 characters. Shows all ages surfing, wipeouts... African lions eating wetsuits and tormenting Pat and Wingnut, all the critters thatll kill ya in Australia...Costa Rica, Biarritz France, South Africa, California, Hawaii, Indonesias G-Land,
South Pacific all lovingly filmed...
