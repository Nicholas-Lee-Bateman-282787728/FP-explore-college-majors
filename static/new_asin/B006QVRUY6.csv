5014176,5,B006QVRUY6,"The entire Universe series is a wonderful take on our understanding of the universe as we presently believe it to be.  The series is explanatory, often with simplified examples used to explain complex processes.  Those with a more extensive knowledge of the science may find the series a bit dumbed down, but not everyone has a serious interest in Astronomy or Astrophysics, and therefore even the passing layman will be entertained by the contents.  The orators are quite enthusiastic.

The series is 99% from the science side of things.  Theology presents some argument in the sixth season but the holes in both theoretical science and religious belief are solidly evident, and the undeniable truth of, we really don't know, abounds with civility between antagonists.

The graphics are of exceptional quality.

The DVD disks are clearly labeled as to their episodic content.  Up through season five, each disk comes in its own case, which sleeves nicely in each seasons box.  The four disks (fourteen episodes) of the sixth season come in a flip case.

My two irks with the entire series are the unavoidable redundancies, as much of the subject matter between similar episodes must necessarily overlap, and more so, the annoyance of repeating what was just covered, directly after the breaks where commercials would be placed.  The latter could have been edited out with no loss to the show.

I recommend the entire series to anybody with a little curiosity.  Five stars!",1431129600,,1473,5.037190082644628

5014223,5,B006QVRUY6,"I really liked this series when it first was run on the History Channel. Actually I still like it. Season 6 is my favorite because of the episode entitle God and the Universe. Most of the series provide food for thought, as they say. Some may make you wonder why you purchased the series as they are somewhat difficult to follow. That is not to say that they don't help in explaining the universe, or should I say try to explain the universe. But they don't dumb it down either. It is the segment on God and trying to identify God in the universe that for me is the most thought provoking. I'm not sure that the discussion helps any in finding definitive answers, and at points I believe it strays from the topic and becomes entangle in scientific jargon and logic. But it nevertheless pushes one to think about and even question one's beliefs....in a good way. At the end of the episode there are no answers of course, no proof, only belief both scientific and religious faith. If you get any in the series of this wonder program, I would actually begin with season 6. It posses the greatest question of them all.",1395532800,2,1114,4.439024390243903
5014224,1,B006QVRUY6,"The Universe - The Complete Season Six could have been a cosmic return to form, but instead winds up being an astronomical waste of time. Most of the ideas presented in this batch of episodes have either already been represented in previous seasons, or come as a result of some scientist shrugging his shoulders and saying, ""What if..."" I'd stay far away from this release, just skip it. However, if you must subject yourself to this season, there are absolutely no supplements, but you'll at least find the video and audio to be represented in a way that's even better than broadcast.",1391904000,2,585,4.745098039215686

5014239,4,B006QVRUY6,"I got this DVD for basically 4 of the episodes; have not seen the rest, but the MIcroscopic Univ, and the UFO parts were interesting. I am more a proponent of Subquantum Kinetics (SK) which has already resolved the quandries that Quantum Physics (QP) is still trying to figure out -- they are on the way to adopting SK, although QP doesn't know it, with their recent foray into Dark Energy -- which is really the same thing as Ether... too bad Einstein was a dork and told everyone to ignore the Ether back in 1905 (which HAS since been proven; it IS anisotropic)... it really is the key. Ether didn't fit in his GTR so he dissed it and told everyone else to ignore it, too, because he hadn't seen it come across his desk as a patent clerk (?) -- which is where he got E=MC2 by the way, but the patent from an Italian physicist was for E=MC, the 'squared' was Einstein's idea (and is wrong). Why do we idolize that guy??

DVD is very well done, graphics are excellent, and the material faithfully follows traditional Quantum Physics teachings.  The Microscopic Universe episode investigate the anomalies in QP and shows just how unusual, marvelous and well-designed our Multiverse is.  Yea, Designer!",1377388800,,1200,4.598130841121495

5014243,5,B006QVRUY6,"Like the rest of the series-informative but not over the head-interviews with giants in the fields of physics, cosmology and astronomy, eye candy graphics, tongue-in-cheek narration. Glad to have the whole series- recommended for everybody.",1372118400,,240,5.885714285714286

5014245,5,B006QVRUY6,"Into Season 6, I can't think of any better series of astronomy DVDs ever.  After 2 seasons, I thought they had used up all the subjects.  Was I ever wrong!  Into season 6, there is always new information and approaches.  This is simply the best pure astronomy series ever produced.  When I am not finding anything worthwhile on live TV, this is my go-to viewing.",1370908800,,362,4.507692307692308

8503342,5,B006QVRUY6,"I love this video!  This, The Universe:  The Mega Collection and How the Universe Works are the most amazing videos on space on the market.  I would recommend this for every home with children in it or with an adult that loves all things space.  At 46 years of age, I still watch this video over and over.

I also like how they incorporate various scientists and astronomers as well.  While watching the series, you get familiar with: where these folks work, what they do, and how excited they are about their jobs.  It is great for kids who can watch these and see various jobs they can have if they wish to work in the space industry.  PLUS, you will find they will stop and watch other scientific shows that contain those same scientists/astronomers, shows that I find are always learning oriented.

Whether by itself or to complete your The Universe:  The Mega Collection, You cannot go wrong with this video.  If you don't have it, be sure to purchase How the Universe Works, (Vol 1), as well.  It will totally round out your set.",1463788800,2,1035,4.505376344086022
