2023780,5,B0001Q5TUE,"When I was told my 2 year old needed to boost her vocabulary at her 2 year wellness check, I searched everywhere for vocabulary building tools.  I found I can rely on some good children's videos.  The Baby Bumblebee series is one of those.  The words are presented clearly with children demonstrating the action.  This helped my almost 3 year old understand the word meanings. Not as entertaining as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Einstein-Baby-s-Favorite-Places-First-Words-Around-Town/dp/B000FGFURW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Einstein - Baby's Favorite Places - First Words Around Town</a>&nbsp;videos.  She lost interest after 2 viewings.  But good in vocabulary building.  I found a new series called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brainy-Yogis-Everyday-Words/dp/B002MZZTHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brainy Yogis: Everyday Words</a>&nbsp;that was also good in vocabulary building, but is Montessori-based.  This video kept her interest a while longer.",1253318400,3,1058,7.544715447154472
2023781,4,B0001Q5TUE,"I have used Bumblebee's initial Noun ( labelling videos) for my 3 year old autistic son - and they were a big hit - they were really effective and he watched them avidly

so we naturally graduated to this series - and to be careful with money we only bought action words 1 - this too is watched - and though the kid is not going crazy with this, he is still picking up sentences and repeating words - which is v good for us

So my rec is - this video is great and if you get it at a discount - we bought at $17 - it is VFM",1248134400,,522,3.6936936936936937

2023783,4,B0001Q5TUE,I bought this DVD for my grandson who is three years old and was diagnosed with autism when he was two. His sister is four. Both of these children loved watching the video but did not want to repeat watching like with the Bounce videos. I thought the DVD was well put together. I think it was a little slow for these two children. They like music and up tempo music. I still would recommend this video and I just put it on in between their other videos. You cannot get enough variety.,1223164800,,484,4.21505376344086
2023784,5,B0001Q5TUE,"The bumble bee ""Action words 1-3"" videos are excellent. They helped my 18-mon son to speak and read greatly.  Every word is so well illustrated in the vedio! The best part of them: My son loves these videos so madly and therefoer learned words from them so quickly!!! There are about 20 words in each vedio.

The ""Motorized Madness"" is also good, it has 10 machines such as ""airplane, bulldozer, dump truck, backhoe loader, helicopter, bucket truck, boat, motlecycle, fire truck, and bus."" It also explains each part of the machine, like the wings, propellers, engine, cab...

The baby bumble bee surely produce the best of the best infant and kids reading program vedios in the market--as good as Dr. Titzer's ""Your baby can read 1-5"" DVDs and Dr. Glenn Dorman's ""How to teach your baby to read"" book.

I love baby bumble bee's ""Opposites"", ""Motorize"", ""Actions words 1-3"" and ""vocabulary builders 1-5"" the most. Highly recommended!",1125705600,17,933,4.923566878980892

8016097,1,B0001Q5TUE,"Got this for my grandchildren. they are age 3 & 18 mo. they hated it. they love baby babble. And since i already had all of them thought i would try Action words. But when i put it in they just walked away and played with a toy. I played it a few different times. but they would just do the same. But every time i put baby babble in they would run to the TV and sit down to watch.  I got to tell you, i watch bumble bee action words and found it boring as well. it was just plan dumb.",1360627200,3,484,3.6990291262135924

The content is there and I do like the teaching method but kids will be kids... My son just didn't like it. He showed preference to BumbleBee's Opposites DVD. However, I still do recommend it based on the fantastic content.  It may work for someone else:)",1329436800,3,429,4.195121951219512

8016100,5,B0001Q5TUE,"After some great results from repetitive viewings of the outstanding ""My Baby Can Talk"" signing video series I wanted to supplement my 20mo baby's vocabulary. The difficulty is finding a video that keeps her interest, has clear examples and is age appropriate. While ""Action Words 1"" doesn't give me that squeaky clean, upscale feeling the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series does (i.e. nice sets, immaculate hair on the models, softened nursery versions of classical music) it still has the warmth, fun and humor that any parent can appreciate. You can tell the children in the video are enjoying themselves and model a given word with the kind of honesty another child can find entertaining and worth sharing. When my daughter sees the other kids tickle eachother and laugh, she laughs and wants to try it out, which is how these videos should work. There are plenty of words on the video covered at different lengths and multiple examples. This is a great vocabulary builder for any child 6 months and older and an essential part of my collection of educational videos for my baby. I look forward to viewing the others in the series.",1264809600,2,1126,4.809278350515464
