7916331,5,B00002SWE0,"I basically agree with a lot of what theslime, the person who wrote the spotlight review, had to say.  There are long segments of Baby Snakes that I regularly fast-forward.  There is way too much backstage nonsense, only a tiny fraction of which is the least bit interesting.  The animation is very stream of consciousness and I was bored with it at first but have grown to really appreciate what this guy was doing.  However, what I want, and what everyone wants, and what Zappa should have known that everyone would want, is more concert footage!  Get rid of the rest of it for all I care.
The footage that we do see and hear is extremely worthwhile.  In fact, Baby Snakes might be the only legitamite release to contain any good live Zappa on film.  Some of the tunes are not my favorite.  I don't care about seeing a live version of Bobby Brown Goes Down or I Have Been in You.  I would have liked to have heard more instrumentals.  However, Baby Snakes is a long movie and there is plenty of great material as well as some charged performances by the young band (obviously having the time of their lives.)  Some of my favorites include: City of Tiny Lights, Black Page #2, Punky's Whips (Bozzio's ""Punky"" is oscar-worthy), King Kong/Pound for a Brown (will Bozzio explode at the climax of his solo?), Black Napkins, Muffin Man, San Bernadino...There is plenty here to make up for the gratuitous filler.
This is the best live Zappa footage that I have seen and therefore it automatically gets the five stars.",1089244800,9,1512,4.562962962962963
7916332,5,B00002SWE0,"Every musician should own this video or see it at least five times.  The musicality is genius, and is one of the best lineups Zappa has ever employed.  The performances are intricately insane, and the claymation is obviously the work of synthetically induced psychedalia.  Even though Zappa didn't do drugs, he employed an artist for the exploratory animation that clearly was...and just like Zappa, humorous.  Baby Snakes is simply a masterpiece!",1027382400,,447,5.253521126760563
7916333,4,B00002SWE0,"What can I say about Frank that hasn't been said before? The man was the reincarnation of Mozart's ... child.  The man was a towering talent, a bastion of integrity and a true purist. The video starts out kind of slow with only a few snippets of music and/or concert footage strewn about some rather long interviews, most notably with Bruce Bickford, a total stoner who happens to be absolutely brilliant in the art of claymation.  Things really heat up in the second half which is mostly music. Frank really belts out the overdrive with his guitar solos in ""Muffin man"", ""City of Tiny Lights"" and ""Punky's Whips"".  In my opinion, these are the highlights of the film.  There is a rather amusing section with a perfomance art dance-a-thon to the tune of ""Black Page"" (which is a song nearly impossible to dance to, that's the joke).  With members like Adrian Belew (King Crimson), Terry Bozio (Missing Persons, Vai, Jeff Beck Band), Patrick O'hearn, Ed Mann and Steve Mars, there's no way you could put together a show anything less than spectacular. There is even a small scene with Warren Cuccarillo asking for an audition.  He went on the join the band and later joined Missing Persons and Duran Duran (!?!?)(as FZ rolls over in his grave...). The humor is vulgar and the riffs are polyrythmic.  Everything is just a bit off, and considering what passes for music these days, that's a good thing! Its rock, its jazz, its comedy, its socially commentary and its utterly brilliant. If you have a taste for the ecclectic and bizzare, then check it out!  FZ forever!",1026432000,8,1565,4.706959706959707
