5090426,1,B007IXS7P2,"Titanic 100 years on is a disgrace.
I have well over 35 docos about the Titanic and this is by far the most miserable excuse for a documentary about the disaster it has been my misfortune to witness.
Where to start?...the background music styles range from 60's beat instrumentals to 90's dance and 30's jazz....close.....but.....
The editing...........apparently that's what it is, is sloppy, rough and vainly done to look cutting edge. It is an epic fail.
There are various ships related to the Titanic story that are mentioned. Amerika, Baltic, California, Titanic itself.....the picture used you may ask???....The Carpathia................I could go on, but I think you get the drift.
Awful.",1338076800,12,695,5.327272727272727
5090427,1,B007IXS7P2,"I've been looking for a video to detail the Titanic story as a supplement to a social studies and reading assignment in my third grade classroom.  I think my students deserve to see the actual, available images and to hear the story from historians.  This is not the right video.

Too many sensationalized clips are included in this video.  It does not present the story chronologically.  Instead, the emphasis is on the most popular facts and stories.  And worst of all for third grade, it shows a crew member shooting himself in the head from a scene in the popular movie. --Totally extraneous and unfounded information.  And it relegates this video to the ""can't show in class"" pile.

It's too bad someone doesn't put out a kids' video on this topic.  Kids are really interested in disasters and tragedies in history.  But we have to remember that some content needs to be edited.  I've looked at other documentaries with little luck.  National Geographic documentaries are also produced with an adult audience in mind so the vocabulary is difficult for kids and the content is labored.

I call this documentary ""fluff"" because it includes more Hollywood scenes than historical images.  Some of the images/film clips are not even the Titanic, but other ships from within the ten years before and after the disaster.  The film makers do not take care to distinguish fact from near-fact.",1337472000,12,1388,4.871794871794871
5090428,5,B007IXS7P2,Titanic was one of my favorite movies when I was younger and I'm so excited to see in on the big screen again in 3D!  This documentary is everything I wanted to know about the true story and just in time for the 100th anniversary!,1333929600,11,230,4.111111111111111

5090430,3,B007IXS7P2,"Was on a Titanic binge, which happens when I'm PMSing and feel like getting some history with my entertainment.  Not thrilling, but a few things I didn't know before.  Worth a look I suppose.",1373155200,,191,4.588235294117647
5090431,2,B007IXS7P2,The film clips used at times have no relationship to the dialog.  There are many misrepresentations of facts as Iknw them from other sources.,1371945600,4,141,4.875
5090432,5,B007IXS7P2,The 3d effect makes you feel like you are part of the movie especially the part where they invite Jack to have dinner with them- Great in3D,1365811200,2,139,4.185185185185185

5090435,5,B007IXS7P2,"I liked the movie, was very informative and it was perfect to have Kate Winset in the movie.  Lovely actress.  Leo should have been in it also.",1347321600,2,143,4.2592592592592595

5090437,5,B007IXS7P2,"This documentary provides insight into the true story behind the Titanic. It's not the dramatized version everyone knows from the movie. I really enjoyed it! It is darker than the movie, just because it highlights the tragedy inherently tied to the event. Fantastic! I would definitely recommend it!",1339459200,2,299,5.25
5090438,1,B007IXS7P2,"When the ""credentials"" for this hour long film - which looks like it was made for the Fox Channel (Not Fox NEWS channel), but probably wasn't - is the fact that it's narrated by the ACTOR who played the role of the Chief Officer in the mega-hit film ""Titanic"", and Leo DiCaprio and Director James Cameron are featured on the package, you should know you are not in for an honest film abut the ship. But, I went ahead anyway and watched it.

The score which underlies the narration is pure 70s/80s power pop with a constantly beating drum. Not only does the score and the drumming drown out the narrationm, but it is totally out of place. Yes, there is commentary from the National Maritime Museum (in Halifax Canada I'm assuming) but everything else is made up of historical still photos and lots of scenes from the Hollywood motion picture. I'd tell you more, but I'll save my words - and your time. This is truly a DVD that is jumping on the timing of the Centenary of the sinking of the Titanic,; nothing more. Don't expect PBS quality here.

I loved Cameron's movie and I am interested in Titanic's history but this is the worst documentary I have ever seen!,1407024000,4,322,4.872727272727273
