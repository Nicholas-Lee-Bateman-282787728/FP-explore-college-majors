3651286,5,B001J4RTGO,"A truely inspirational, moving depiction of courage in the face of great odds.  The DVD is easy for viewers of all ages.  DVD content designed to reach an audience of varying ages.  A great supplement to the book.",1245456000,5,213,4.552631578947368
3651287,5,B001J4RTGO,"A wonderful read, especially after watching the lecture. A brilliant man with a fantastic look on life taken too soon.",1243728000,,118,4.95
3651288,5,B001J4RTGO,"this is a great compliment to the book, but is a great viewing experience on its own",1242518400,3,84,4.0
3651289,3,B001J4RTGO,"Interesting and sad but a self help book as routine as any with much the same general content.  One plus and a standout is the optimism Professor Pausch was able to maintain throughout his ordeal.  It was also fortuitous that with this documentation of his last few months, he was able to leave future income for raising his 3 children with the profits from the book and DVD.  I am sure this gave him a peace of mind for their future well being and support for his soon to be widowed wife.  The DVD is the better of the two.",1240272000,15,524,4.21
3651290,5,B001J4RTGO,"It is unfortunate that we can't appreciate life.  Unfortunately life is short and this lecture should be appreciated by everyone, if only to help appreciate just one more day!  If you have kids this is a must.",1237161600,,209,4.621621621621622
3651311,5,B001J4RTGO,"Excellent book- motivating, entertaining and enlighting.",1412208000,,56,8.5
3651312,5,B001J4RTGO,Inspirational for sure!!!,1409443200,,25,7.666666666666667
3651313,5,B001J4RTGO,Amazing.........very very good!,1405382400,,31,9.666666666666666
3651314,5,B001J4RTGO,Randy Pausch's story and lessons he shares with us in this book is truly a gift in itself. I bought about 10 copies and gave it to family members as a Christmas gifts.,1402099200,,167,4.090909090909091
3651315,5,B001J4RTGO,"I bought this DVD to go along with my teaching materials for Randy Pausch's book, ""The Last Lecture."" The length of this video (30 minutes) fits nicely into a class period with time left over for discussion. Although this DVD does not encompass the entire length of Pausch's actual ""Last Lecture,"" I feel it is well worth the investment.  My students felt it was beneficial to see and hear Pausch, and we were able to discuss how Pausch's ""voice"" came through in the book. Since I required my seniors to give a ""last lecture"" of their own, I used this video to model for them how they should approach their speech. I highly recommend this video, both as an invididual, motivational video and as a classroom teaching tool.",1400112000,6,721,4.6328125
3651316,5,B001J4RTGO,"Grandson rewceived this from us for his 16th birthday.  He wasn't sure what it was about, but when he watched it with us even he was impressed.",1393804800,,143,4.296296296296297
3651317,5,B001J4RTGO,"Yes, this is a lecture!  However, it is more like a life testimony!  This is the kind of DVD you can watch in any setting and be able to teach people from.  Whether you are a person of faith or agnostic, Randy Pauchs' testimony has the ability to touch you! I would highly recommend you watch it with a class or family setting.  I absolutely loved this DVD!",1393113600,,357,4.205882352941177
3651318,4,B001J4RTGO,Over all good dvd. Wish it had come with some teaching tips. For the money it was a good value. Thanks,1392681600,,102,3.9047619047619047
3651319,4,B001J4RTGO,"The video is edited to about 30 minutes.

Just right for a class room. However, some parts are very valuable for me were deleted.",1390521600,,129,4.375
3651320,3,B001J4RTGO,"Fair, perhaps best suited for children.  But I got it for a college class, and it was not as useful as simply showing some of his final lecture already available on the Internet.",1386806400,,178,4.393939393939394
3651321,5,B001J4RTGO,One of THE most inspiring videos I have ever seen.  The man had a unique ability to go deep into the heart of things.  Will make you really evaluate what is or is not important in your life.  Especially important for those of us past a certain age but also a valuable lesson for the younger generation who think of themselves as immortal.,1384646400,,338,4.333333333333333
3651322,4,B001J4RTGO,"This is a very inspirational film and good for audience. of any age.  While the particulars will become dated in time, the message it conveys is timeless.",1380844800,,154,4.703703703703703
3651323,4,B001J4RTGO,"I first became aware of the Last Lecture while Randy Pausch was still with us. I have shown the lecture in several formats over the years, but lost the original DVD I had bought several years ago. I bought this DVD to show on my student leadership retreat (high school students). I was not aware that this was an edited version of the original lecture. A great deal of the original lecture has been edited out including several humorous moments such as the stuffed animals that he had brought onto the stage, more detail about getting the job with Disney, and the video example of his students collaborative efforts. Randy Pausch's spirit shines through and the message of the lecture remains. I have not yet discovered the interactive part of the DVD, so can't comment on that.",1379808000,3,778,4.686131386861314
3651324,5,B001J4RTGO,Dr. Pausch's accounting of his travails with cancer and his unbelievable ability to describe how he used his struggles to teach others the true beauty of living is amazing.  What a special person.  Anyone who reads this will certainly be touched!,1370736000,,246,4.975609756097561
3651325,5,B001J4RTGO,It was very interesting reading.  I would require it for any parent to have a inside view of what need to be said to your kids.,1361750400,,127,3.8846153846153846
3651326,5,B001J4RTGO,"This is a great video for any and all ages.  Be determined to define and achieve your dreams, and finish well!",1359676800,,110,4.238095238095238
3651327,5,B001J4RTGO,"Great, great book from a real, special perspective by someone living it and thus a true one of a kind perspective and insight to this very unique and very real life experience that we all can learn much from and gain a lifetime lesson from. I love this book and place it in a category all its own...",1358640000,,299,4.172413793103448
3651328,4,B001J4RTGO,Purchased Amazon gift card for aunt. She wanted to some help with her purchase as she had never purchased from Amazon before. She chose this book and was very happy when it was delivered. A happy aunt is a happy nephew and a perfect gift.,1358294400,,238,4.311111111111111

3651330,3,B001J4RTGO,My son had to read for school and it the title of the book already gave him a terrible idea from the actual  book. It was an ok book if you need an extra advice in life.,1354406400,,169,3.5675675675675675

3651332,5,B001J4RTGO,Everyone should watch this video! It's a user's manual for the heart. We should teach our children the essence of this lesson before we worry about all of the trappings of our present day society.,1334707200,4,196,4.628571428571429
3651333,5,B001J4RTGO,"With only 13 million hits on YouTube this should have 13 billion, but it needs to be translated into every language on the planet. Watch it on YouTube, then buy it and show it to your kids, and if you meet someone ask them if they saw it. This mans view of life is an example to every person. I am thankful he wanted to leave this to his children, as it is now available to everyone, for free. I watched it on the net, and I bought the DVD to have it, just in case. I am hopeful not only my children will learn from it but that it will be passed to my descendants. If you read this far consider I bought it three years ago and have not watched it recently. I do need to watch it with my children again as they are now in college. This is the only video I want my children to watch and understand how great this man was. A Google search will find it, watch it, buy it.",1312502400,8,867,3.8764044943820224

3651335,5,B001J4RTGO,"I first saw the Last Lecture uncut online.  Honestly, I was a little disappointed in the cuts made for the dvd version, but I cannot bring myself to give that particular message anything less than 5 stars.",1279670400,14,205,4.54054054054054

8311859,5,B001J4RTGO,Poignant messages from Randy Pausch.  I used it as a training tool at a workshop.,1447718400,,81,4.4
8311860,5,B001J4RTGO,"I was not as happy as I expected to be.  I had already seen the full uncut version and it is awe inspiring.  Whoever decided to chop it up for the DVD was clearly NOT a deep thinker.  I obviously did not pay close enough attention when I ordered the DVD on Amazon. I find it totally disrespectful to Randy, the Pausch Family and Randy's extended family at Carnegie Mellon.  The Last Lecture is a treasure for all ages and everyone should take the time to watch it.  The full version is available to watch at

http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/  I've watched it several times and I will continue to enjoy it often.  And to the fool(s) that made the decision to chop it up.........well, that's what they are....just fools!",1447027200,,719,4.606299212598425
