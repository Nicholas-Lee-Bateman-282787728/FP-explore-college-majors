3695280,5,B001MBTRQY,"This dvd is exactly what I was looking for: a follow-along workout consisting of stretching and kicking exercises followed by a detailed tutorial of basic front, side and rear kicks.  An excellent addition to my martial arts training!",1250208000,8,234,5.157894736842105
3695311,5,B001MBTRQY,Great for a warmup/stretching routine as well as helpful on learning technique.,1431993600,,79,5.666666666666667
3695312,5,B001MBTRQY,Very helpful,1429056000,,12,5.5
3695313,5,B001MBTRQY,Awesome! Although I am nowhere near as flexible as this guy I have learned how to throw a few kicks properly. Great workout.,1428278400,2,124,4.434782608695652
3695314,2,B001MBTRQY,"If i were a beginner this video would be informational. Warm up, kicks, and drills were all very elementary. I read the reviews and thought this dvd would have great kicking drills and stretches, but it was all stuff i've seen and done before. Overall i thought it was okay, just not what i was hoping it'd be.",1410393600,,310,4.362068965517241

3695316,4,B001MBTRQY,"I'm a Taekwondo competitor and bought this to add to my library.  I was initially drawn to this video because of the trailer - it showed how to break down the main kicks of Taekwondo.  I also spent a few years training in MMA.  My coach was huge into having us break down our mechanical movements.  In case you don't know, the secret to building speed is to break down your functional and mechanical movements slowly.  So I bought this video.  I found it to be very useful.  I wouldn't recommend it as a fitness/workout resource.  Rather, I would highly recommend it if you're a serious martial artist that is looking to really improve your kicking arsenal.  I believe the principles will transfer to any martial art style but a TKD athlete will gain the most from this.  The hip check, tension/release, and spin development drills were the most useful for me.  Though I had never heard of the instructor before, he is a polished kicker and does a good job narrating throughout the video.",1391212800,21,988,4.588571428571429
3695317,5,B001MBTRQY,Great video. Helped a great deal with my technique. I also recommend the other videos when you complete the last.,1388188800,,113,4.7
3695318,1,B001MBTRQY,I found very little about this video to be beneficial for Taekwondo training and kicking. Maybe a few warmup tips but that's about it. Save your money.,1288224000,,151,4.62962962962963
3695319,5,B001MBTRQY,"James does an outstanding job of creating a video ANYONE can use to become more proficient at kicking in martial arts.  The video and lighting are excellent with clear audio.  He takes you through at an even pace and walks (kicks?) you from start to finish.  I am a neophyte (yellow belt) and at 44 years old and 250 pounds from weight lifting, I am NOT light on my feet or flexible.  However, I consistently review this video and follow his recommendations and am slowly seeing progress.  My kicks are getting faster and more accurate.  I would recommend this video to anyone interested in improving their martial arts.",1284681600,6,620,4.694444444444445
3695320,5,B001MBTRQY,"I must say that this DVD really exceeded my expectations!!!!!!!  I would recommend this product to any and all Taekwondo practitioners, from the beginner looking to establish solid fundamental form to the advanced competitive fighter looking to refine his or her technique.  James Huang offers exceptional pointers that are within grasp of anyone desiring to learn and to improve.  By emulating his breaking-down the steps for kicking, I have witnessed significant improvement in my own technique that I couldn't get from most of the other DVDs I own in my huge martial arts instruction collection.  Choose ""The Kick Coach"" if you want to be a champion!!!  Eagerly anticipating Volume 2.",1270684800,6,687,5.209090909090909
8320856,5,B001MBTRQY,Boyfriend is a purple belt in Tae Kwon Do and is training for a tournament. Bought this as a Christmas present. He loves the workout and said it is very helpful.,1520380800,,161,4.225806451612903
8320857,4,B001MBTRQY,"An excellent teaching experience.
I can't list all of the good qualities because they're so many.....
Well worth the money.
I'd buy it again, and would buy another DVD by the same folks without hesitation.",1489708800,,205,4.885714285714286
8320858,4,B001MBTRQY,recomend to all . very good follow along dvd. would to see another perhaps a vol. 2,1486857600,,83,3.9411764705882355
8320859,5,B001MBTRQY,"excellent video.  just what I was looking for.  I'm a medium degree belt at the local karate dojo, and we do a lot of sparring with full gear.  my ground and pound has always been top in the dojo because of my wrestling and bodybuilding background, but my kicking attacks frankly suck... I've always been slow and not flexible there.  I was taught to chamber early in my training, but my speed, flexibility, and technique have always been lacking.
Thanks to this home instruction, i'm getting better.  Just do the video, repeat, and practice.

Cud you find this info for free on the internet, probably..  but using a laptop as opposed to a dvd remote in front of a TV is definitely NOT my preference.  and for 18 bucks, I can mirror this in my home training space easily with one hand holding the remote.  training in front of DVD's IMO is way better than stopping and messing with a laptop.  I have a library of over 200 martial arts training titles and this is quickly becoming one of my favorites.

AND NO.. you don't master combat without engaging in combat.. OFTEN.  But I also know a DVD is more bang for ur buck usually than doing katas. (sorry Master, please don't beat my ass)
  I've learned more from weeding thru DVD's and practicing those little nuggets that I've found here and there, then trying them out while I'm in the dojo sparring.

Of course it depends on ur descretionary income.  but if ur choices are over 100 bucks a month at a dojo or 18 bucks for training on demand easily.. well to me that's a no brainer.

If you're new to martial arts training and ur kicking attacks suck, need improvement with your footwork, and would like to train at home, and have 18 bucks to spend, well Id say to you, here's EXACTLY what you need.
Thank you Master Huang.  You've definitely given me a chance to become more competitive at my dojo.",1480204800,3,1849,4.4523809523809526
8320860,5,B001MBTRQY,great video,1477008000,,11,5.0
8320861,4,B001MBTRQY,Good kicking exercise format that you can go back and study and learn .,1469232000,,71,4.142857142857143
8320862,5,B001MBTRQY,"Great guide to all the basic kicks and footwork of Kukki-style Taekwondo, up to and including black belt level. Includes a great follow along workout of the neccesary muscles and movements for each kick, and also includes clear demonstrations and instruction on the neccesary footwork to make the kicks work in sparring. This guide is the best I have found so far to develop effective and technical kicks, perhaps with the exeption of the ""Revolution of Kicking""-DVD series, but this is right up there, and fare more concise, which I think is a good thing. Highly reccomended for any Taekwondo-practitioner or anyone who wants to kick like one.",1450742400,,644,4.972222222222222
8320863,5,B001MBTRQY,"well made dvd. Excellent warmup and stretch section. Drills for developing kicking technique are excellent. This will not substitute going to
a good Martial Arts school and learning from a Master. But it has alot of drills and techniques that you can work on your own at home.",1444780800,,276,4.770833333333333
8320864,5,B001MBTRQY,"This kid is fast. I mean freakin fast on his feet! Clear and easy to follow instruction. Teaches U proper form of kicks: roundhouse, front kick, axe kick, spinning back kick, side kick, spinning hook kick and push kick. Slow motion exercises that give U power and speed. But the real gold is in the footwork part. These techniques are good for evasion, movement and initiating attacks. If U practice them all U will become fast. Repitition and consistency is up 2 U. Lazy people don't buy this.",1440547200,2,494,4.625
8320865,3,B001MBTRQY,Many of the recommendations you find in this video are available on youtube for free.  Bill Wallace has a whole series that makes these same recommendations.,1436572800,,157,5.038461538461538
