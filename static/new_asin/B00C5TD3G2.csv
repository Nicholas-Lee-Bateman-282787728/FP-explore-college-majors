5690844,1,B00C5TD3G2,"Indescribable seemed like a good movie but it was hard to understand, it would freeze and skip. We don't even know how the movie ended as it just stopped. I would like a replacement, but when I go in to select a reason to replace, the dropdown button does not drop down. I am very disappointed as the movie looked like it was a very wholesome family movie. I am still going to try to figure out how to have the movie replaced, but my time is running out.",1381276800,,454,4.112359550561798
5690845,5,B00C5TD3G2,I was more than surprised. I have given this movie for gifts to many of my friends. All have come back and told me what a great movie it was. My kids have watched over and over.,1376697600,6,177,3.810810810810811
5690846,5,B00C5TD3G2,"What a nice surprise!  We first saw this at my brother's church in Texas and my 11 year old quickly bought it for Father's Day for his Dad.  We have since watched it a few times and shared with friends.  The children actors and actresses are wonderful, so fresh and charming!  After viewing this movie our 13 year old has been playing it on the piano and we have found ourselves as a family singing this hymn, frequently!  The production quality was good too!  We hope there will be more from Stacy and her husband.  We need more movies like this that a family can watch together and be edified.",1373846400,16,595,4.3545454545454545
5690847,5,B00C5TD3G2,Great family film. Incredible message on how to have a relationship with God and why. Perfect for children. I will watch it again soon.,1484697600,,135,4.666666666666667

5690849,5,B00C5TD3G2,"Since giving up television, I only allow myself to watch Christian movies. Having said that, I have seen MANY that obviously did NOT have a budget to afford experienced actors, etc.  Therefore the film had a good message but the acting was bad...This was NOT one of those films! I enjoyed this film from beginning to end! I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially someone wanting a good family friendly film.",1484524800,3,417,4.791666666666667

5690854,5,B00C5TD3G2,"While this movie may not have been of the highest caliber, it nevertheless touched on some of life's most important issues: family, and love for God and trusting in Him even when our very heartstrings are wrenched. The entire family is adorable...you can't help but be drawn in by them. I especially loved Fern. We can see so much more sometimes when we have limitations.",1483401600,,371,4.723076923076923

5690871,5,B00C5TD3G2,"I agree with the other reviewers about the over the top music, costumes, acting, etc., but the message and the retelling of the development and history of the old hymn, The Love of God is excellent and worth anyone's time watching it, child or adult!",1480032000,,250,4.5777777777777775

5690879,5,B00C5TD3G2,"I watched this with my children, and I was pleasantly surprised at the touching story line.  Some of the speaking felt a little slow at times, but I couldn't help wonder if during that era people were not as fast of speakers as we are in our world today. If you are NOT a person who believes in God, or makes fun of those kind of things or people, nor really appreciates things that speak of His love and beauty then you are unlikely to appreciate this gem. I would not discourage anyone from watching it, of course!! But it requires a certain taste for these things.  My family and I are not watching movies like the new Star Wars, and Avengers-- with swearing, etc.. We enjoy movies like the Despicable Me, the Croods, How to Train Your Dragon, and Kung Fu Panda. So we don't only watch old movies.  But we are very selective because we want to be able to identify the voice of God, which is hard to do if you are filling your mind with swearing, violence, nudity, dark themes, etc.  This movie will be appreciate by those ""pure of heart"" and those willing to slow down from the fast pace of the world to learn the subtle messages of hope and love through Christ. I felt happy to discover it, and I recommend it to my fellow Christian. Give it a shot no matter what your belief system, but PLEASE don't go ripping on it IF religious movies are your thing.",1472083200,,1357,4.2890625

5690889,5,B00C5TD3G2,"It is a simple movie, seemed to be aimed at the younger age group but I enjoyed it.  In fact I will never forget the movie.  Based on the writing of a old beloved song...plus the search for a word that describes God's love. When the movie was over, I told several friends to watch it.  Makes complicated things simple.  Plus so much fun to see a family of children trying to help out with the song and with earning money.  Loved the clothes everyone wore.  Just a good simple old fashioned wonderful movie!",1466899200,,506,4.329787234042553
5690890,5,B00C5TD3G2,"Great movie.  Some of the acting is kind of like a high school play or the local drama club  but for the most part they did a great job. I love the song ""The Love of God"" and it is interesting to know the story behind it.  The girl that played the blind girl did a great job.

5690895,5,B00C5TD3G2,I really enjoyed Blynns journey to loving God. It was child-like faith. The movies characters are lovable and the faith displayed in the home was touching. Definitely a family film.,1464307200,,181,5.066666666666666

5690916,2,B00C5TD3G2,"While the message was good, the rest of the elements that make a movie, a MOVIE, fell way short. Solid B for effort, but execution was a fail. I hate to review a movie so harshly, especially one promoting faith in God, but I have to wonder if all the glowing reviews were from people who were actually in the film. Maybe if I had known the people personally it would have appealed to me more, but I've seen school plays with better acting than this movie!  The thematic music was over the top and distracting as well. I choose to watch this based on the positive reviews. I cannot recommend this film. The story would have been much better written in a book with a few simple illustrations.",1453593600,10,690,4.348837209302325

5690918,4,B00C5TD3G2,"This movie is a great family movie. It is set within a large family that has been visited by trouble on more than one occasion.

It can be viewed by the whole family if you're willing to explain the dangers of going off to war and why death happens to some, but not others.  The kids are great in getting themselves involved to help the family as a unit, something missing in many families today.

5690944,5,B00C5TD3G2,"Obviously a low-budget film, not the best acting, and not always historical clothing, but our family really enjoyed the film!",1444176000,,125,5.3
5690945,5,B00C5TD3G2,"While this is pitifully low-budget the story is so great I still give it 5 stars.  There are moments that are just inexcusably bad, such as very modern buildings in the not too distant background of a shot from around 1920.  But the story is great and the child actors are good.  Just go with it and you will find a heart-warming family film.",1443312000,,342,4.3125
5690946,4,B00C5TD3G2,The content was 5 stars but it was very evident that it was armature.  It had good examples of character development.  The father is a good example of leading his family toward God even in adversity.,1443139200,,199,4.5
5690947,5,B00C5TD3G2,"Indescribable addresses the essence of feeling, understanding and knowing - loving God with all of your heart, soul, mind and strength as told in a story interweaved throughout the ages. The final song is amazing - both the words and the movie's artistic rendering of it. The movie is a simple presentation of life changing truth that spans history and attests to the interweaving of the loving testament's of God. We are to love God and love people - and a righteous God sent his son to die for us - so that we might live through Him. This is the eternal truth told in Indescribable.",1443139200,2,584,4.518867924528302
5690948,5,B00C5TD3G2,Amazing story behind the song The Love Of God. Very emotional.,1442534400,,62,4.7272727272727275
5690949,5,B00C5TD3G2,I loved the movie....so uplifting and inspiring!,1442448000,,48,6.0
5690950,4,B00C5TD3G2,"Although a little slow, interesting story and good family film.  A young boy's struggle with how to love God is interwoven with the story of a hymn written by his father with help from a Rabbi who had lived in the Middle Ages.",1442275200,,226,4.255813953488372
5690951,5,B00C5TD3G2,"It is an enjoyable movie - even to watch just as entertainment;  but it is much more!  Those that believe in Christ will get much out of this movie, also some History lessons thrown in for good measure.  I hate History Lessons - Except ones like these.  They intergraded them into the movie Very Nicely ! ! !  When I saw the time period of the movie, I was concerned about being able to understand what they mean by what they say (lot of Old Time Movies are like that for me), but I did not have any problems understanding!
  I can't find all the right words to describe what I think and how I feel so I guess the movie is truly Indescribable !",1441756800,,644,4.104
5690952,5,B00C5TD3G2,Very moving story based on a historical event.,1441411200,,46,4.875
5690953,5,B00C5TD3G2,Super movie. Thought provoking in terms of one's personal relationship with God. A good reminder to take stock of what is truly important in life.,1440374400,,146,4.88
5690954,5,B00C5TD3G2,Beautiful,1438992000,,9,9.0
5690955,5,B00C5TD3G2,Excellent movie for the whole family! I love the story behind this hymn.,1438214400,,72,4.615384615384615
5690956,3,B00C5TD3G2,"Loved the storyline, but the acting was amateurish.",1437523200,,51,5.5
8577471,4,B00C5TD3G2,Good movie.  A little slow.  But the message is worth waiting for.  The children are precious.,1486684800,,94,4.75
8577472,5,B00C5TD3G2,"This is a wonderful story about a great hymn, ""The Love of God!""  I didn't know the story behind it before, and has given it a totally new meaning. This film also helps answer the questions of how to love God, and what it looks like. I would highly recommend this film as one that is wholesome, uplifting, and has a positive Gospel theme!",1486598400,,338,4.28125
8577473,1,B00C5TD3G2,Nott interesting at all and the actors are not good. Especially the one who plays the father.. we find him very irritating!,1485993600,,123,4.636363636363637
8577474,5,B00C5TD3G2,"Really enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed the story behind the the song 'The Love of God""",1485820800,,81,4.466666666666667
8577475,4,B00C5TD3G2,"Love the weaving of history and faith into the story of how the hymn ""The Love of God"" came to be.  Very inspirational and heartwarming.  Would have given it 5 stars but acting was a bit amateur.  Well worth watching especially for people of faith.",1485734400,,248,4.466666666666667
8577476,2,B00C5TD3G2,"I started to watch it and could not finish as I was having stomach trouble...... will finish watching it at a later date, when I get over the flu.  Nothing
to reflect on the movie, just on living with school children in the house.",1485648000,,230,4.2272727272727275
8577477,5,B00C5TD3G2,Movie provided a great resource for my Sunday school lesson on importance of loving God,1485475200,,87,4.866666666666666
8577478,5,B00C5TD3G2,"I love the song ""The Love of God"".  I grew up with our Mother singing it to us since we were babies. My sisters sang it in church as a trio.  And we all learned to sing and harmonize this song.  I have always loved how it made me see the glory of God. This movie portrays how it was written and the search the 10 year old goes on to understand loving God who love for us is indescribable. I would like to buy this movie for my collection of christian movies.",1485216000,,458,3.903225806451613
8577479,3,B00C5TD3G2,"Nice show for kids or to watch as a family, when the grand kids come over.  I enjoyed no swearing or nudity and the ending was an unexpected twist.  The sets were beautiful, the acting was stilted and the four youngest kids were the best actors in the entire cast.  I have never heard of this hymn before, but I'm not Protestant.  Was this Canadian?  Because the acting and dialogue are always a bit off in Canadian films but their sets are always beautiful.",1485129600,,458,4.404761904761905
8577480,3,B00C5TD3G2,"Kind of ""A low budget movie"" feeling. The acting is just OK.",1485129600,,60,4.083333333333333
