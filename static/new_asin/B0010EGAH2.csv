3048754,3,B0010EGAH2,"This is not a review for the movies, or for the Blu-Ray transfer. This is a review of the packaging. The discs are stored in cardboard sleeve pages inside a book like case that slides out of the exterior ""jacket."" It's not terribly easy to remove the discs without putting your fingers on both sides of the discs and leaving fingerprints.

I also dislike this type of packaging because the discs slide in and out of the cardboard, and there is potential for damage. In fact, it looks like one of my discs has a small scratch on the outside edge that you would expect to see if it were scratched while being rotated into this type of cardboard sleeve.

I know that some people don't mind this kind of packaging, but I would not have purchased this set had I known about it, so this review is to let others know what they're getting.

There was a sticker on the shrink wrap that says ""Includes 3D and 2D Versions of Kiss Me Kate plus Exclusive Collectible Art Cards""

So it would seem that the 3D version of Kiss Me Kate is there for those who might be concerned about that.

The collectible art cards are kind of cool, but I would have much preferred better storage for the Blu-Ray discs.",1425427200,15,1187,4.352941176470588
3048755,5,B0010EGAH2,"I can't wait for this to arrive. Preliminary reviews suggest this will be THE release of 2015.
And yes, the disc for 'Kiss Me Kate' has both the flat AND the 3D version.",1424476800,8,169,4.151515151515151
3048756,5,B0010EGAH2,"This set sounds wonderful, but I have a question?  Is the version of Kiss Me Kate included here in 3D?  Th description is not clear.

I finally received this set and was very disappointed in Kiss Me Kate.  The 3D is terrible!  I have a Sony Bravura 55 inch set and play my discs with a PS3 and active glasses.  This usually plays all modern 3d movies brilliantly.  Kiss Me Kate is full of ghosting.  Even if you close one eye the image surrounded by a halo.  Others rave about how wonderful the picture is.  Is there an adjustment I can perform?",1424044800,,545,4.254901960784314
3048757,3,B0010EGAH2,"I was amazed at the amount of videos I've recieved it was totally unexpected ,we will never manage to watch them in our lifetime as we are 80 yrs old so a bad mistake for us .the collection is for archavists serious collectors ,far too much for our needs ,we will just have to pick what we wish to watch.",1418428800,,304,4.083333333333333

3048759,3,B0010EGAH2,"The collection consists of many wonderful musicals as well as many not so wonderful ones. Review the list of titles and see if you wouldn't be ahead to purchase only those individual features you don't already own and that are of interest to you. Virtually everything in the set is available as an individual title and can be purchased, in many cases, brand new for $5 or less. For those excellent titles in the collection I would give rating of 5 stars for those lesser titles maybe a 1 star - thus resulting in a 3 star for the entire collection. The price would indicate that you are paying for the speciality packaging and the availability of buying all these titles in a single purchase - still not a great value in my opinion.",1292544000,7,732,4.470149253731344
3048760,3,B0010EGAH2,"For the musical fan, most of these will already be in their collection (""Hallelujah I'm a Bum"" has been issued and cheaply available, for instance). The rare films are so few that it's not cost-effective to buy the box set. So if you're an alien who dropped in a month ago and took a fancy to musical shows, this might be useful. I think that you'll see it heavily discounted after it doesn't sell well. There are plenty of rare musicals from those studios that could have made a terrific box set, and I hope they do one. A fan of Eddie Cantor is unlikely to enjoy the Elvis films, which I don't think Elvis liked a lot.",1226102400,28,620,4.262711864406779

On the bright side you have the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein Musicals, Danny Kaye in the delightful ""Hans Christian Anderson"", outings by Ethel Merman and Donald O'Connor in ""No Business Like Show Business"" and ""Call Me Madam"". There's the unique tragedy starring Harry Belafonte in ""Carmen Jones"" and the modern classic ""Moulin Rouge"". Also, for the first time on DVD we get some older Goldwyn entries such as Al Jolson's ""Hallelujah I'm a B u m "", which did poorly at the box office but is really quite good and most notably, Eddie Cantor in ""Kid Millions"" and ""Whoopee"". Also there is Don Ameche is some really delightful but seldom seen films such as ""Moon over Miami"".

On the not so bright side, you have to sit through several rather dismal Elvis films. Some musicals, although not seen for years such as the 1938 Goldwyn Follies are a bit of a mess. Some musicals that were terrific on stage just didn't translate that well into film such as ""The Fantasticks"" and ""A Chorus Line"".

3048763,5,B0010EGAH2,I already had the Blu-ray of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (which is nothing short of stunning) and a DVD version of THE BAND WAGON and KISS ME KATE (a full frame 1.33:1 copy) but decided to purchase the Blu-ray Musical Collection because I wanted the 3-D version of KISS ME KATE in it's wide screen format. Buy the four disc set was only half again as much as purchasing a single disc version of KISS ME KATE. THE BAND WAGON is stunning in Blu-ray and CALAMITY JANE is a lot of fun. The 3-D of KISS ME KATE is likely to best of any film done during the 1953-54 3-D heyday and it was the one 3-D film which wasn't screened theatrically in my town when originally released. Well Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER didn't get a 3-D showing either but it returned several years later in 3-D. KISS ME KATE uses 3-D in a very creative way that truly enhances the enjoyment of the film. Also the sound was recorded on three track magnetic and is marvelous to hear. The voices (songs) come from the front center and the music uses two tracks that give the effect of coming from the orchestra pit.,1486339200,3,1074,4.269607843137255

3048769,1,B0010EGAH2,"Warner Home Video has said they are through with compendium releases like this one. I sincerely hope that's true, seeing as how this four disc affair features a regurgitation of the Singin' in the Rain release (which is perfect but utterly pointless if you already own it), a simply gorgeous debut of the classy affair - The Band Wagon, and two less than enthusiastic releases of Kiss Me Kate and Calamity Jane (the only musical in this set not made by MGM). There are issues with Calamity and Kiss. First, Calamity - some minor Technicolor misregistration, some muddy colors and one glaring shot of Doris Day with the top of her head cut off. Me thinks this to be an old transfer or at the very least, a new transfer culled from some very tired and careworn source materials. Not good. Kiss Me Kate gets both a 2D and 3D release. The 3D is frankly, a revelation - virtually unseen until now as the 3D craze had worn out its welcome by the time the picture made it into theaters. The 3D image is razor sharp and colorful - a winner. The 2D is inexplicably softly focused in spots and suffers from some inconsistently rendered colors. Not loving this in 2D. Bottom line: a very mixed bag from Warner. I would strongly suggest if you already own Singin in the Rain, you simply cut your losses, but The Band Wagon and Kiss Me Kate individually and forget about Calamity Jane - by far the least appealing transfer in this set.

Two of these are classics that any musical theater buff should know (Singin' In The Rain, Kiss Me Kate), and two are less well known (Calamity Jane, The Band Wagon).
Well-worth the price, the Blu-Ray editions don't bring anything that wasn't already apparent on dvd versions of these musicals, but the collection itself retains merit simply based on the contents.

If you haven't seen these films you haven't lived. Band Wagon and Singin' are absolute Hollywood classics and two of the greatest Musicals (and movies) ever made. The picture quality is marvellous I couldn't fault them. The sound (especially on Singin') is superior to a lot of newer films released, I actually had to turn the amplifier down a couple of times.

As far as I am aware it was not shot in this format.
Can someone out there confirm? . And why SINGIN IN THE RAIN on Bluray yet again??  Could we not have had SHOW BOAT or ANNIE GET YOUR GUN (from the same era?).

I'd never seen Calamity Jane. I wouldn't put it in the same class as the others but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch. Singin in the Rain is probably the best of the bunch as far as the movies are concerned but The Band Wagon is a very close second. All look terrific. Anyone who owns a Blu ray player will want to own this set. I have yet to peruse all of the extras but the ones I have, mostly the original theatrical trailers, are cute. The Calamity Jane disc features a classic Looney Tunes short, Duck Dodgers in the 241/2 Century. Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Marvin the Martian. One word. Priceless.",1427673600,4,894,4.391566265060241

3048810,4,B0010EGAH2,"Well, this is really a first rate presentation of 3 big MGM musicals and a mild WB one. Indeed, as much as I love Doris DAY and Howard KEEL, ""Calamity Jane"" can't compete with ""Kiss me Kate"" and the rest, and David Butler is no Minnelli, Alas...However, the image is really crisp and the Technicolor is ....vibrant, as it should be ! The first complaint I would mention is the cardboard set used to store the 4 blurays, it's not very practical to take out the BD discs from a very narrow sleeve, you have to wipe the fingerprints on the edge of the BD quite often. The second complaint is about the bonuses : the 1948 travelogue about Manhattan has been trimmed from a 20 mn duration to a mere...5 minutes on the ""KISS ME KATE"" bluray, and the juke box selection on ""Singin in the rain"" is missing as well !",1427414400,,807,4.281045751633987

3048812,5,B0010EGAH2,"I already had DVDs of  The Band Wagon,  Kiss Me Kate, and Calamity Jane, but I took a chance on this purchase because I had read that the colors had been upgraded. This collection is worth it. Some people have been unhappy with the packaging, but I didn't find that to be a problem. The colors on the three I already had are so much more brilliant; it's worth the purchase price just for the difference in the visuals for Calamity Jane alone.

My TV and Blu-ray player are not 3D, and I had a little difficulty at first accessing the 2D version of Kiss Me Kate. But I posted my question here on amazon and got the information I needed. I had been watching something else, and even though I changed the Input from DVD player to Satellite and back again, the only message that came up was that it ""could not read this disc."" After I had completely turned off everything, though, I gave it another try and the message came up that I did not have 3D capabilities and to push the OK button for the 2D version. I don't know why I didn't get that message before, but it's working now. So if anyone else is having trouble accessing the 2D version, I suggest turning off everything and trying again.

I haven't watched The Band Wagon or Singin' in the Rain all the way through yet; but I played a little just to see what they looked like, and they both look great.  The colors on Calamity Jane and Kiss Me Kate were terrific. If you love these old musicals the way I do, I recommend this collection very highly--and you can't beat the price per disc at only $7 or so.",1426982400,3,1558,4.25

the Blue Ray Bandwagon and was astonished that it looked so flat. The same thing with Kiss Me Kate. I do not have a 3 D TV. To be sure, I also played my older DVD versions and there was zero difference between the older DVDs and the blu ray discs with the exception of. Singing in The Rain which looked as good as it did on the blu ray I had previously purchased. I have a brand new Blu Ray player and a 4k resolution Samsung TV. No problem there. Is it possible I received defective discs.

A friend of mine also had the same experience as I so it isn't just me. Wondering if I should reorder individually to see if there is any improvement. I was so looking forward to the blu ray transfer especially of The Band Wagon.",1425945600,4,945,4.1923076923076925

3048817,5,B0010EGAH2,"Wow! I received this set on March 3 from amazon and was immediately impressed with the packaging and production values.

First off - both the 2D and the 3D versions of ""Kiss Me Kate"" are included. I didn't even realize that was the case when I ordered this set.

Second - the packaging is really well done. There's a heavy paper case with each BluRay housed in a separate sleeve, much like the Universal Monsters or the Complete Star Wars Collections, except that the discs are easier to remove from this packaging. That case is housed in a sturdy slip case, so the discs are going to be well protected over the years. There are also 4 lobby cards included - one from each film. These are oversized and do not fit inside the BluRay packaging, which I consider a bit of a bummer as I think it would have been nice if the cards were housed inside with the discs. Hey - at least they included the lobby cards!

BTW - for those who complain about the packaging and the fact that you may need to grab the discs' playing side with your fingers to get them out, there are a few workarounds: 1. buy a box of eyeglass lens cleaner wipes and place one between your fingers as you grab the disc, or 2. you can simply shake the packaging gently, allowing the disc to make its way out of the sleeve. I found the discs very easy to remove from the packaging.

Further BTW - all 4 films are available separately on BluRay in plastic clamshell packaging. That's a more expensive way to buy them, and you don't get the lobby cards, but if you want your discs on plastic spindles, that's the only option available.

Third - as to the movie transfers, I have so far viewed all but ""Annie Get Your Gun,"" and the image and sound are really good in the three films I've watched, thought KMK has a high level of grain. The video & audio improvement in the films themselves are especially noticeable when set against viewing the included extra features which were done for the DVD release - the DVD images don't have the clarity of the BluRay images, and I don't think any time or $ was spent upgrading these produced-for-DVD features for hi-def.

Highly recommended.",1425513600,14,2143,4.398989898989899
3048818,5,B0010EGAH2,".

This is in my humble opinion the bargain of the year. I binged on three musicals in one day. I am unspeakably pleased. I'd have paid this price - heck, I did, for Singin' in the Rain which I already own - for each of the *four* movies included. (Shhhh, don't tell Warner Bros.)

Perhaps we live in a ""spoiled age"", so we don't know anymore to leave ""extraordinary enough"" alone? This is not to say that we are not entitled to our diverse opinions, just that sometimes we may miss what a miracle it is to have this quality of home theater experience at our fingertips, for the cost of one pound of fillet mignon. As recently as fifteen years ago, the idea of watching Kiss Me Kate at home in such exceptional condition would have been pure science fiction.

You expect me to criticize this set? I won't. To me, there's nothing deserving of criticism. No-thing. Picture Quality is amazing - way better than the DVDs, for the couple of titles regarding which I can make the comparison in good faith. Not ""a little"" better, way so. Exemplary restorations. Aspect ratio in KMK is quasi-ideal regarding both the original ratio and the widescreen TV abilities ( a mere 1.75 to 1.77 conversion, other information offered online is erroneous ). The other three movies are presented to perfection in their original format (1.37), with equally pleasing, eye candy-like yet faithful to the original, picture quality.

Even the packaging, ultimately less consequential for some of us is, for its kind, classy and flawless. In my opinion of course. With a modicum of attention nothing will happen to my discs. (I respect the fact that other reviewers' experience could be different.) Stylish artwork.

Regarding the substance, watching these classical musicals better than they looked in cinema (yeah I am that old).... for less than seven dollars each, and being able to see them over and over? The Doris Day's, the Fred Astaire's, the Gene Kelly's, the one and only Oscar Levant [""I used to know Miss Doris Day before she became a virgin"" (-:]? Choosing 2D or 3D for an amazing-looking Kiss Me Kate (the movie looks great in both formats, both included on one Blu-Ray disc, and I am lucky to own a Panasonic VT60 with stellar 3D) - the ultimate Cole Porter musical which includes fourteen different musical gems and then some more? You kidding me? Kiss Me Kate in 3D will become The 3D ""show-off"" piece for my parties.

Thank you, Warner Bros. You made one customer tremendously happy and I hope many other such gifts from you shall be forthcoming. That this was a costly, time-consuming labor of love on your part was obvious to me. For the little money I paid I genuinely felt that this was, almost literally, a gift.

I pre-ordered this set months ago and have been looking forward to seeing this movies - especially ""The Band Wagon"" (my all-time favorite movie musical) - on blu ray. When the set arrived I was disappointed to find that the movies are in a bound, book-type package similar to how a season of a TV show might be packaged. I had been under the impression that the set would contain the films in their own individual case (like how they're available for purchase individually) but sold in a slipcase.

Of primary interest for musical buffs are the HD premieres of The Band Wagon, with its crackerjack Howard Dietz-Arthur Schwartz songs (Thats Entertainment, Dancing in the Dark), and Kiss Me Kates first home video appearance in its native 3D format.

BLU-RAY SPECS: AVC encoded 1080p transfers are on-tap across the board, with The Band Wagon and Singin in the Rain presented in 1.33 and Kiss Me Kate and Calamity Jane in 1.85. The presentations are sparkling generally for all, and Kiss Me Kates 3D transfer is exceptional in its clarity and depth-of-field detail. 5.1 DTS MA stereo tracks/remixes are also on-hand for all titles save Calamity Jane, which is presented in 1.0 DTS MA mono. Extras include commentary by Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein on The Band Wagon along with a DVD Making Of, vintage doc The Men Who Made the Movies: Vincente Minnelli and more; premiere and awards newsreels, the trailer and bonus shorts on Calamity Jane; Ann Miller hosts Cole Porter in Hollywood: Too Darn Hot, a vintage doc short, the trailer and other extras on Kiss Me Kate; and all the archival bonuses from Singin in the Rains prior single-disc Blu-Ray.

The discs are stored in cardboard sleeve pages inside a book like case that slides out of the exterior ""jacket."" It's not terribly easy to remove the discs without putting your fingers on both sides of the discs and leaving fingerprints.

I also dislike this type of packaging because the discs slide in and out of the cardboard, and there is potential for damage. In fact, it looks like one of my discs has a small scratch on the outside edge that you would expect to see if it were scratched while being rotated into this type of cardboard sleeve.

I know that some people don't mind this kind of packaging, but I would not have purchased this set had I known about it, so this review is to let others know what they're getting.

There was a sticker on the shrink wrap that says ""Includes 3D and 2D Versions of Kiss Me Kate plus Exclusive Collectible Art Cards""

There's the unique tragedy starring Harry Belafonte in ""Carmen Jones"" and the modern classic ""Moulin Rouge"". Also, for the first time on DVD we get some older Goldwyn entries such as Al Jolson's ""Hallelujah I'm a B u m "", which did poorly at the box office but is really quite good and most notably, Eddie Cantor in ""Kid Millions"" and ""Whoopee"". Also there is Don Ameche is some really delightful but seldom seen films such as ""Moon over Miami"".

On the not so bright side, you have to sit through several rather dismal Elvis films. Some musicals, although not seen for years such as the 1938 Goldwyn Follies are a bit of a mess. Some musicals that were terrific on stage just didn't translate that well into film such as ""The Fantasticks"" and ""A Chorus Line"".

Buy the four disc set was only half again as much as purchasing a single disc version of KISS ME KATE. THE BAND WAGON is stunning in Blu-ray and CALAMITY JANE is a lot of fun. The 3-D of KISS ME KATE is likely to best of any film done during the 1953-54 3-D heyday and it was the one 3-D film which wasn't screened theatrically in my town when originally released. Well Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER didn't get a 3-D showing either but it returned several years later in 3-D. KISS ME KATE uses 3-D in a very creative way that truly enhances the enjoyment of the film. Also the sound was recorded on three track magnetic and is marvelous to hear. The voices (songs) come from the front center and the music uses two tracks that give the effect of coming from the orchestra pit.,1486339200,3,1074,4.269607843137255

There are issues with Calamity and Kiss. First, Calamity - some minor Technicolor misregistration, some muddy colors and one glaring shot of Doris Day with the top of her head cut off. Me thinks this to be an old transfer or at the very least, a new transfer culled from some very tired and careworn source materials. Not good. Kiss Me Kate gets both a 2D and 3D release. The 3D is frankly, a revelation - virtually unseen until now as the 3D craze had worn out its welcome by the time the picture made it into theaters. The 3D image is razor sharp and colorful - a winner. The 2D is inexplicably softly focused in spots and suffers from some inconsistently rendered colors. Not loving this in 2D. Bottom line: a very mixed bag from Warner. I would strongly suggest if you already own Singin in the Rain, you simply cut your losses, but The Band Wagon and Kiss Me Kate individually and forget about Calamity Jane - by far the least appealing transfer in this set.

3283309,5,B0010EGAH2,"I already had DVDs of  The Band Wagon,  Kiss Me Kate, and Calamity Jane, but I took a chance on this purchase because I had read that the colors had been upgraded. This collection is worth it. Some people have been unhappy with the packaging, but I didn't find that to be a problem. The colors on the three I already had are so much more brilliant; it's worth the purchase price just for the difference in the visuals for Calamity Jane alone.

My TV and Blu-ray player are not 3D, and I had a little difficulty at first accessing the 2D version of Kiss Me Kate. But I posted my question here on amazon and got the information I needed. I had been watching something else, and even though I changed the Input from DVD player to Satellite and back again, the only message that came up was that it ""could not read this disc."" After I had completely turned off everything, though, I gave it another try and the message came up that I did not have 3D capabilities and to push the OK button for the 2D version. I don't know why I didn't get that message before, but it's working now. So if anyone else is having trouble accessing the 2D version, I suggest turning off everything and trying again.

I haven't watched The Band Wagon or Singin' in the Rain all the way through yet; but I played a little just to see what they looked like, and they both look great.  The colors on Calamity Jane and Kiss Me Kate were terrific.

the Blue Ray Bandwagon and was astonished that it looked so flat. The same thing with Kiss Me Kate. I do not have a 3 D TV. To be sure, I also played my older DVD versions and there was zero difference between the older DVDs and the blu ray discs with the exception of. Singing in The Rain which looked as good as it did on the blu ray I had previously purchased. I have a brand new Blu Ray player and a 4k resolution Samsung TV. No problem there. Is it possible I received defective discs.

3283314,5,B0010EGAH2,"Wow! I received this set on March 3 from amazon and was immediately impressed with the packaging and production values.

First off - both the 2D and the 3D versions of ""Kiss Me Kate"" are included. I didn't even realize that was the case when I ordered this set.

Second - the packaging is really well done. There's a heavy paper case with each BluRay housed in a separate sleeve, much like the Universal Monsters or the Complete Star Wars Collections, except that the discs are easier to remove from this packaging. That case is housed in a sturdy slip case, so the discs are going to be well protected over the years. There are also 4 lobby cards included - one from each film. These are oversized and do not fit inside the BluRay packaging, which I consider a bit of a bummer as I think it would have been nice if the cards were housed inside with the discs. Hey - at least they included the lobby cards!

BTW - for those who complain about the packaging and the fact that you may need to grab the discs' playing side with your fingers to get them out, there are a few workarounds: 1. buy a box of eyeglass lens cleaner wipes and place one between your fingers as you grab the disc, or 2. you can simply shake the packaging gently, allowing the disc to make its way out of the sleeve. I found the discs very easy to remove from the packaging.

Further BTW - all 4 films are available separately on BluRay in plastic clamshell packaging. That's a more expensive way to buy them, and you don't get the lobby cards, but if you want your discs on plastic spindles, that's the only option available.

Third - as to the movie transfers, I have so far viewed all but ""Annie Get Your Gun,"" and the image and sound are really good in the three films I've watched, thought KMK has a high level of grain. The video & audio improvement in the films themselves are especially noticeable when set against viewing the included extra features which were done for the DVD release - the DVD images don't have the clarity of the BluRay images, and I don't think any time or $ was spent upgrading these produced-for-DVD features for hi-def.

Highly recommended.",1425513600,14,2143,4.398989898989899
3283315,5,B0010EGAH2,".

This is in my humble opinion the bargain of the year. I binged on three musicals in one day. I am unspeakably pleased. I'd have paid this price - heck, I did, for Singin' in the Rain which I already own - for each of the *four* movies included. (Shhhh, don't tell Warner Bros.)

Perhaps we live in a ""spoiled age"", so we don't know anymore to leave ""extraordinary enough"" alone? This is not to say that we are not entitled to our diverse opinions, just that sometimes we may miss what a miracle it is to have this quality of home theater experience at our fingertips, for the cost of one pound of fillet mignon. As recently as fifteen years ago, the idea of watching Kiss Me Kate at home in such exceptional condition would have been pure science fiction.

You expect me to criticize this set? I won't. To me, there's nothing deserving of criticism. No-thing. Picture Quality is amazing - way better than the DVDs, for the couple of titles regarding which I can make the comparison in good faith. Not ""a little"" better, way so. Exemplary restorations. Aspect ratio in KMK is quasi-ideal regarding both the original ratio and the widescreen TV abilities ( a mere 1.75 to 1.77 conversion, other information offered online is erroneous ). The other three movies are presented to perfection in their original format (1.37), with equally pleasing, eye candy-like yet faithful to the original, picture quality.

Even the packaging, ultimately less consequential for some of us is, for its kind, classy and flawless. In my opinion of course. With a modicum of attention nothing will happen to my discs. (I respect the fact that other reviewers' experience could be different.) Stylish artwork.

Regarding the substance, watching these classical musicals better than they looked in cinema (yeah I am that old).... for less than seven dollars each, and being able to see them over and over? The Doris Day's, the Fred Astaire's, the Gene Kelly's, the one and only Oscar Levant [""I used to know Miss Doris Day before she became a virgin"" (-:]? Choosing 2D or 3D for an amazing-looking Kiss Me Kate (the movie looks great in both formats, both included on one Blu-Ray disc, and I am lucky to own a Panasonic VT60 with stellar 3D) - the ultimate Cole Porter musical which includes fourteen different musical gems and then some more? You kidding me? Kiss Me Kate in 3D will become The 3D ""show-off"" piece for my parties.

Thank you, Warner Bros. You made one customer tremendously happy and I hope many other such gifts from you shall be forthcoming. That this was a costly, time-consuming labor of love on your part was obvious to me. For the little money I paid I genuinely felt that this was, almost literally, a gift.

I pre-ordered this set months ago and have been looking forward to seeing this movies - especially ""The Band Wagon"" (my all-time favorite movie musical) - on blu ray.

3283317,4,B0010EGAH2,"A nifty four-disc compilation offers the Blu-Ray format debuts of Vincente Minnellis top-notch 1953 MGM backstage musical The Band Wagon starring Fred Astaire; MGMs 1953 production of Cole Porters Kiss Me Kate with Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson; the bland, if inoffensive, Doris Day Warner Bros. vehicle Calamity Jane (1953) also co-starring Keel, with breezy songs by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster; and a reprisal of the already-available Blu-Ray of Singin in the Rain (1952). Of primary interest for musical buffs are the HD premieres of The Band Wagon, with its crackerjack Howard Dietz-Arthur Schwartz songs (Thats Entertainment, Dancing in the Dark), and Kiss Me Kates first home video appearance in its native 3D format.

BLU-RAY SPECS: AVC encoded 1080p transfers are on-tap across the board, with The Band Wagon and Singin in the Rain presented in 1.33 and Kiss Me Kate and Calamity Jane in 1.85. The presentations are sparkling generally for all, and Kiss Me Kates 3D transfer is exceptional in its clarity and depth-of-field detail. 5.1 DTS MA stereo tracks/remixes are also on-hand for all titles save Calamity Jane, which is presented in 1.0 DTS MA mono. Extras include commentary by Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein on The Band Wagon along with a DVD Making Of, vintage doc The Men Who Made the Movies: Vincente Minnelli and more; premiere and awards newsreels, the trailer and bonus shorts on Calamity Jane; Ann Miller hosts Cole Porter in Hollywood: Too Darn Hot, a vintage doc short, the trailer and other extras on Kiss Me Kate; and all the archival bonuses from Singin in the Rains prior single-disc Blu-Ray.
