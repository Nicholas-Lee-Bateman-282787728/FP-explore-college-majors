8303610,4,B001G1FLQ0,"Bondi Rescue is a 2 DVD season of fun.  Taking place on the famous Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, Bondi Rescue follows the professional lifeguards who patrol the beach and the tens of thousands of visitors it attracts each day.  No two days are the same as the lifeguards deal with near drownings, reckless accidents, serious accidents, lost children, thieves, blue bottle swarms, and a host of other adventures.  The lifeguards are entertaining and fun to watch but take their job seriously.  A good choice if you like your reality tv to show actual life instead of stuff dramatized for the camera's.  I look forward to more seasons.",1315785600,,637,4.861111111111111
8303611,3,B001G1FLQ0,"Another season of Bondi Rescue, another couple of rookie lifeguards joining the old hands for amateur athletic competitions, occasional real-life drama and frequent almost-drama.  What's not to like?

I started watching Bondi Rescue while living briefly a couple of miles south of Bondi Beach, and although nothing I experienced while there was like what's on TV, it's still nice to see another season on DVD for a connection back to the place. Those not familiar though will likely enjoy this too: the cameras follow around the real-life lifeguards at the most crowded beach in the world, and guess what - they're regular guys (and one woman, Brooke). Unlike American ""reality"" TV, no one gets voted off, and it appears that nothing was cooked up just for the show. (If they were cooking stuff up it would have been more dramatic.). The result is a kind of innocence, practically wholesomeness, that's refreshing. Yes, the lifeguards sometimes deal with a thief, or someone with drugs, or a ""pervert,"" but the very idea that millions of people pass through Bondi and the theft of one person's wallet is newsworthy - I won't say it's quaint, but it does remind you that the bad eggs are a tiny minority.

My one complaint about the DVD issue of this season, as well as the first two, is that it could use an edit to remove the redundant bits. When shown on TV there were commercials, so there's theme music before the commercial break and a recap after. This material is all included on the DVD, so every 7 or 8 minutes you get a review of what you just saw. It gets old after a while. They should recut it for DVD to be a continuous show without break, like other tv shows do when releasing on video.",1283126400,,1701,4.6072607260726075
