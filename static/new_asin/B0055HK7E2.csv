8458225,1,B0055HK7E2,"Once every 100 years an atmospheric phenomenon occurs at this one particular location (Blue Moon Inn) in which the moon looks blue. The proprietor of the inn has invited people to come and see the event and experience the paranormal haunting. There is also a guy with a camera who does some filming. Although this is not technically a hand held genre film, the angles are so bad it should be. Oh yeah, there is also a ritual that is going to happen, and someone dies and this is also a murder mystery. Then there is the goddess which may or may not be the moon.

The first two minutes of the film with its bad acting and dialogue should warn most viewers away.

8458226,4,B0055HK7E2,I watched this with a few friends and scared all of us pretty good.  This reminded me of some of the classic suspense movies in that it's not necessarily about blood and gore but more about playing with your imagination.,1384041600,,220,4.5
8458227,5,B0055HK7E2,"Hope you are ready for a good, scary movie because this one delivers. I've seen similar plots before of course but this still had me guessing and made me jump out of my chair more than once. Horror fans will dig this.",1368921600,,217,4.190476190476191

8458229,1,B0055HK7E2,"This movie was horrible. It's all blurry, can't understand what the actors were saying, didn't understand the point of the movie/ what was going on. All in all, when the movie ended, all I got out of it was WTF. I wasted 1.5 hours of my life... I want it back",1365811200,,259,4.098039215686274
8458230,4,B0055HK7E2,I'm a big fan of the Paranormnal Activity movies and this is cut out of the same piece of cloth. This deserves a wider audience.,1354579200,,128,4.16
8458231,4,B0055HK7E2,This was one of those stories that I found myself thinking about late at night after watching...it kind of sneaks up on you how creepy this actually is.  The ending is really creepy!  I love a good ghost story.,1353456000,,210,4.358974358974359

8458233,3,B0055HK7E2,"This is a stylish, British, ""They check in, but they don't check out"" horror film.  It's obvious someone took a look at Paranormal Activity, and the same sort of scares happen here.  There's also a good amount of casual sex and nudity involving attractive women, which is always appreciated.  Naturally, this kind of fun is soon severely punished.  There's a legend of course, and tons of blood, and somebody or something picking people off one by one--but just the mates of the three couples at first.  The innkeeper, of the Tony Perkins variety, is a likely suspect.  Unfortunately, nobody's very likeable or interesting, so we don't particularly care what happens to the characters, but all in all an enjoyable low-budget effort if you like this sort of thing.  Let the ""extras"" roll after the credits--they're entertaining as well.",1322956800,,835,5.007246376811594
