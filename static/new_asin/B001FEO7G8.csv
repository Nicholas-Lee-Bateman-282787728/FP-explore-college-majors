3587274,3,B001FEO7G8,I happen to be one of those girls that thinks Bam can be funny but usually he is just a bratty self centered kid. What makes him funny to me are Ryan Dunn and Brandon DiCamillo. Without those guys he is just a little bit too annoying.. The movie should have had them in it.. One stooge just isn't as funny without the other two.,1234828800,,328,4.061538461538461

WHERE THE #### IS SANTA

I bought this DVD for my girl for Christmas and she could not have been any happier, she is absolutely in love with Bam. So it was a big hit with her which made me a big hit with her, nice. Any way I watched this with her that night which was ok because I am a fan of Bam and all them so it was cool. It has been a while since anything new has come out from these guys so I was excited to watch it, I knew it would good.

The movie is all about Bam and company taking a trip to the Arctic Circle some where in Finland trying to find the real Santa Claus. Apparently the only thing left for Bam to get his wife Missy since she has everything she could possibly want he decides that the real Santa is the only logical gift. Accompanying him on this trip is his brother Jess and Chad I. Ginsburg from CKY, Mark Hanna, Joe Frantz, and a personal favorite of mine Brandon Novak. Back at home Missy and Bam's parents have to put up with not only two members of The Bloodhound Gang [including the ever funny Jimmy Pop] but also S***Goose, and Mark the Bagger. One of the main driving points behind this film is the two bets that are going down with the Bagger, one with Novak and one with Bam. With Novak is a bet to see who can get the most girls, and with Bam it is whether or not the real Santa is in Finland. The prize for the Bagger against Novak is a sexy robot and with Bam it is none other then Bam's wife Missy, yes he bets her.

In Finland the boys harass each other and by that I mean mostly Bam messing with Novak pretty hard, I feel so bad for this guy all through the entire film. Also along the way they decide that they need a map so Hanna is volunteered to get a horrible map tattooed on his stomach. Of course it would not be a Bam related film if HIM is not involved some how, so while in Finland they stop of at HIM's rehearsal studio to get directions and advice and also film a performance. Also the 69 Eyes and a few other bands pop up every now and then, but it is the appearance of the Dudesons that excites me. These guys are crazy beyond words and I love that they do not just cameo they are threw out the entire film. These guys just add a whole new dimension to the movie and even are involved in one of the grossest parts of the movie. All I am going to say is it involves eye balls, Novak and a male's part [if you know what I mean] from a dead animal.

Back in the states Missy and Bam's parents are hard at work at working on a huge surprise party for Bam, while the B.H. Gang and the Bagger are out looking for girls. The girl hunting parts are hilarious, especially when Jimmy Pop dresses up as Bam and gives the Bagger the worst advice on getting girls ever. Of course when they finally get some girls to come back to castle Bam with them two very funny players from Bam's new movie ""MINGHAGS"" show up, classic moment. Mean while back in Finland all the guys have to hike, travel by dog sled, reindeer, and snow mobile to reach Santa's house only to find Santa is on vacation. Do they ever find him before they head home, you will have to watch and see but there is a nice party waiting for them when they return home and all ends well {sort of} for Novak eventually. He even gets one over on Bam; excellent moment indeed [well played sir, well played].

Bam as always is his usual jerk yet funny self all through out this entire movie, as is Jimmy Pop and the Bagger [the funny part not jerk]. Chad and Jess are great as well, great to see those guys in this [OVER HERE], you will get that once you watch it. Hanna and Frantz as expected are just as funny as the rest; still Hanna's best thing was his over the top laugh on ""Haggard"". Everyone else in the movie is great but the show stealer is definitely Novak {who is the star, and rightfully so} with out a doubt, he is this movie's Dico I guess you could say. And of course you know the Dudesons are hilarious only adding nothing but laughs, poor Novak he hates these guys. And yes people this is a movie, a thought out written down in screenplay format movie based in reality. Bam, Frantz, and Joe De Vito wrote a hilarious film and Bam and De Vito's direction is seamless, Bam also serves not only as a producer but as an Executive producer as well.

This movie is worth every penny in my opinion and is beyond a rental, I suggest you buy this because it truly is a funny movie. If you liked Jackass, Viva La Bam, CKY, and especially Haggard then you will love this. And sure Dico, Dunn, Rake, and Raab are nowhere to be found on this DVD, but those who are make this hilarious. And who knows maybe in the future all of them will eventually work together again, maybe a ""Where the #### are those guys"" will be in the works. Still you can catch all those guys plus all these guys in ""Minghags"".",1231632000,13,4825,4.089757127771911

It kept me laughing the whole time, Bam's antics never get old. Definitely worth 5 stars. The only complaint I have is that I think it would have been soooo much better if Dunn, Dico and Raab would have been in it. But even so, it was still a great movie.",1228521600,,387,3.7901234567901234
3587279,5,B001FEO7G8,"I bought the DVD on 12/2/08; and let me tell you that I laughed so $&%*ing hard!!  Bam hasn't lost his touch when it comes to his pranks and humor.  The movie reminded me a his CKY days and I really felt sorry for poor Brandon Novak being the brunt of his jokes!  Bam's wife, Missy Margera, is looking pretty as ever, Jessie looks good, glad to see Chad I. Ginsburg, Mark Hanna is a mess, and Joe Frantz was funny too.  Really wished that Rake Yohn, Brandon DiCamillo, Ryan Dunn, and Raab Himself was with Bam in this movie, but I still enjoyed it!  This DVD is a must for Bam Margera/CKY fans.....I highly recommend it!",1228348800,6,620,4.264957264957265

I would have loved to had Ryan, Rake, or Dico in the movie, but this movie is still insane. The bits with Andy McCoy and the belly tat scene had me in tears.

While Bam and crew are overseas, his wife and family remain at home to plan for a Christmas Party while their uninvited house guest, Jimmy Pop from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodhound-Gang/dp/B000AJJNPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodhound Gang</a>, is on a mission to get his slightly retarded sidekick Mark The Bagger (a Whack Packer from the Howard Stern show) laid. Meanwhile Bam and company meet up with various rock star friends like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HIM/dp/B000040OWR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HIM</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-69-Eyes/dp/B000N3SS4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 69 Eyes</a>, as well as Andy McCoy from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hanoi-Rocks/dp/B00013R8L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hanoi Rocks</a>&nbsp;who gives them clues as to where they might find Santa's lair. In the process one of the guys gets a tattoo of a map of Finland on his stomach that they all use as their guide and they eventually get lost somewhere near the Arctic circle and have to sleep in freezing conditions.

There's not really much to say about WHERE THE F**K IS SANTA other than the fact that it's exactly like Bam's other stuff, which isn't a bad thing. As much as you try to hate the guy, the bottom line is that he and his crew are so over the top, obnoxious, and funny that you can't help but enjoy it. If you like VIVA LA BAM, JACKASS, CKY, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BAM-S-UNHOLY-UNION/dp/B001LLUVKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BAM'S UNHOLY UNION</a>, you'll like this. Just think of it as an extended and uncensored Christmas episode of VIVA LA BAM, except without Rake Yohn, Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Brandon DiCamillo, and (fortunately) Don Vito present. Their absence isn't really explained but it also isn't really much of an issue anyway because if Bam is involved then trouble and mayhem will follow regardless. The film also has a ton of good music from the likes of Dimmu Borgir, GWAR, Clutch, CKY, Five Finger Death Punch, The 69 Eyes, Viking Skull, and HIM, just to name a few.

The DVD doesn't really have a lot of Extra Features except for a photo gallery and about twenty minutes of Deleted Scenes, including a scene involving an ice sculpture of Bam's naked dad sitting on a toilet, the guys doing shots of melted candle wax,  and a full performance by HIM that had to be cut out of the film due to one of Bam's friends rocking out a little TOO hard.

3587284,1,B001FEO7G8,"I bought this movie because I was told that Jussi69 and Jyrki69 from The 69 Eyes were going to be in it, as well as shots of Finland, where a friend of mine and I want to go and visit soon.  Well, the boys are in it, but don't blink or you'll miss Jyrki, and Jussi is in it for approximately 3 shots.  And the Finland shots are exceptionally beautiful, as I figured they would be.  They also, mercifully, use a song from The 69 Eyes as part of their soundtrack: ""Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams"", which was cool to hear and a nice surprise, but...despite those tad little offerings of joy, it wasn't worth the money I paid for it.

I was introduced to Bam's sense of humor with this movie and I guess I just don't get what the appeal is.  He hurts others and laughs about it, but when the tables are turned (when the Dodesons use roman candles to attack the group) he gets all pissy and wants to hide out in his teepee.  I sort of smirked:  ""You can dish it out, but you can't take it, huh?  Niiiice one, Bam.""  I got a real bad feeling he's probably going to end up accidentally killing someone in the future with his antics and this is supposed to be funny?  Then again, his buddies must like being masochists because they keep coming back for more, knowing how Bam is going to treat them, so I can't say as I feel very sorry for them.

I don't get this type of humor.  I don't guess I ever will. It's downright mean and degrading. You can keep it.",1287446400,3,1447,4.128571428571429

3587288,1,B001FEO7G8,"When Bam was up to his old hi-jinks on Jackass and (at least initially) on Viva La Bam, he and his crew were fun to watch. The casts were a bit different depending on the era, but there was a stable core to the friend group that lent some enjoyment to watching them act like idiots. To a certain extent, the old material felt real and honest - it was alot like they'd just taken a camera along while they were goofing off.

But this new material is absolutely nothing of the sort. Bam's new friends are all complete idiots and self-absorbed jerks, and the show is so scripted and edited that it's basically just Reality TV (tm) for mook-addicted MTV flunkies. ""Bam's Where is Santa?"" feels fake, contrived, forced, drawn out, artificial, planned line-by-line, etc. It's joyless and not funny. It seems the days when Bam (and company) was fun to watch are long gone.

They need to go back to the beginning and be real again, or quit making TV.",1262476800,8,942,4.47093023255814

None of the original jackass crew are in this film. It was like he just wanted to promote his record label and bar. The only good scenes where of Finland and HIM.

I got this expecting something like Jackass or Viva La Bam. However it's quickly apparent that nearly everything is strictly scripted.. It's just not believable. Even though Viva La Bam was somewhat scripted it still felt far more spontaneous and improvised, and Don Vito was hilarious! But this is a tragedy of which alcohol couldn't even fix.

There were only two scenes that I genuinely enjoyed. The first was when they picked up a guy, pulled down his pants, then blasted snow up his butt with a snow blower. The other was a 5 second scene when Collette De Benedetto steps out of a hot tub. Snow enema, hot girl, that's it!

This seriously had epic potential but completely fails as a result of their use of a lame, unbelievable script instead of a more reality based production method..",1241568000,,920,4.74375

I had wanted to watch this movie for a few years and just never got the chance. Wouldn't you know that literally 2 days after it arriving it was on MTV. I would have been much happier watching it for free. Its not to say its the worst thing ever, as it did have its good moments, just not really what I was hoping for.

My friends hated it WAY more than I as they were expecting basically another Jackass movie, which it really is not, saying its just too forced and disingenuous. Their top 3 favorite things about the movie (and basically the only three things really) were:
1: Bam's woman in bed in panties
2: The map of Finland tattoo
3: Andy McCoy from Hanoi Rocks

As the description says, it follows them around ""searching"" for the real Santa who apparently does not live in the North Pole. It is filmed on the real deal cameras, no college B crap here. It is pretty much a longer version of a Viva La Bam episode, which I also enjoyed, so this definitely gets thumb up from me. Besides the footage of the travels and antics from the guys (constantly screwing with Novak), there is also footage in PA of Mark the Bagger (daddy nooo!) and the Bloodhound Gang singer and another mini story of Missy setting up a Christmas party and searching for a Christmas present for Bam. In my opinion this one is worth the dough, spent about $10 on it a while ago and thought it was well worth it, much cheaper now a days, so go for it!
