8621679,4,B00GB0ORUW,"- Synopsis: Club activities are a fundamental component in educational institutions.

However, the new candidate for Student Council President announced that any club deemed unproductive, will be shut-down. Unfortunately, our protagonist and his friends' club, fall under that category. So, the next best course of action? Despite being a dark-horse, it's to participate in the election and compete directly against them! Tune in to find out the up-hill and down-hill battles of Ojima and friends as he attempts to save his club.

- Comments: I bought this anime on impulse, and enjoyed it quite a bit. Though, it had it's fair share of quirks, like every anime does. It's similar in concept to a few other anime such as Food Wars!, albeit with way less fan-service and maybe somewhat of Ben-To. Anyways, the girls are cute, and the protagonist knows how to have fun, but isn't too silly. I'd say he's pretty likable.

- Analysis: Relationships are complicated. If you're going to let someone into your heart, be prepared to experience both the good and bad times associated with that person (or pet). If you don't want that responsibility, then best avoid making that connection in the first place.

On a much lighter note. I know how it feels when people get your name wrong, Ojima! I don't understand why people call me ""Andrew"" when my name is Andy... Isn't it more effort to to use a six-letter name over a four-letter name like Andy? I mean, it's not that hard to remember... And yet, I occasionally get called Andrew.
*Sigh* A person's name is pretty important. Though, I have been guilty of forgetting other people's names. I'm better at remembering faces, anyways.

- Features: Contains Japanese audio, with English subtitles. The subtitles are yellow, as opposed to being white. There are 12 episodes (+OVA) on 2 Blu-rays. The run-time is about 5 hours and is rated TV-14 for some violence and suggestive dialogue/scenes.

- Conclusion: This anime is fairly easy to get into and isn't too convoluted. The girls are cute and the characters are fairly likable. The fan-service is on the light side. The plot starts getting serious as the series progresses (which is normal), but picks up too much speed to the point of being rushed, in my opinion.
Keep in mind that this anime contains Japanese audio with English subtitles only. No English dub in case that is a deal-breaker for some of you. Overall, this was an entertaining and silly anime (but not too silly) that slipped under my radar. If any of what I said sounds appealing, why not give it a try?

- Recommendations: The Devil is a Part-Timer!, D-Frag!, Haganai, Student Councils Discretion, Oreshura, Classroom of the Elite, Samurai Flamenco, The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors & Hostel Behavior, Mayo Chiki!, Shomin Sample, Shimoneta, Ben-To, and Food Wars!",1522454400,,2824,4.920168067226891

8621683,5,B00GB0ORUW,"These kids are standing up for what they believe is right, and I loved watching them do it. No one should lose their favorite club to another one and these sweet loving students aren't backing down. I enjoyed watching the whole process of the election and how they had to win over their student body. I felt like I was a part of it and could see myself voting for one of the characters depending on their principles. I hope you enjoy watching the poll as much as I did.",1412208000,,469,4.222222222222222

8621686,5,B00GB0ORUW,"This anime absolutely blew my mind and to be honest, I thought it was going to be odd and too short, but in reality..it was amazing and perfect! :3 I definitely recommend it to anybody who enjoys a good romantic comedy. It's perfect!",1398124800,3,233,4.441860465116279
8621687,5,B00GB0ORUW,"The Shokken Club is short for,""Shokuhin Kenkyu-kai"",in English,""Food Research Club"",a presently reconized club at the Takafuji High School. The school support ,read,""funding"", is target by one of the high school's candidate's for student body president,Satsuki Shinonomde, the very attractive and likable...big boobs..sister to the club's advisor,Ms Hazuki, who keeps a beer dispensor in the clubroom of-""they"" won't fire me unless I get too wasted to teach"".
 There are only two males,(one maybe a bit light in the loafers,)the rest are teen aged girls,all cute as could be,of course, and they do not like the idea of giving up using the school funds they use to buy snacks which they rate,thus meeting the goal of ""research"". As such,the club decides to fight by running the lead male,Yuki Ojima,NOT Oshima,as he is ready to remind. Thus,the battle begins.
The story,however,has long-started. An undercover agent for the Security Department is run down after obtaining evidence of corruption. She is left in a coma at a hospital,much to the distress of the present student body president,Mouri,a one that never opens his eyes...it's a style seen in anime from time to time. As he cannot run in the up-coming election,he joins with the very reluctant Yuki to win the election but,it takes quite awhile to find out for what end and even political newbee Yuki has his suspicions. Thus begins the intregue-filled,""Election"" part of the title.
Love and chocolate is a whole other part of this delightful and worthy series. Yuki's life-long friend and constant companion is Chisato, a cute and bubbly girl-next-door. She had experienced a serious trama at a very early age when her little brother,Diachi,was hit by a truck righ after an argument with her involving a chocolate bar. Somewhere in the story you will wonder if Yuki is just a stand-in for Diachi or something else. You will know at the end,after one enjoyable ride.
There are only three panty shots,all of Morishita,the dark-haired,mono-tone speaking,seemingly,""out-of-it"" girl in the club but who holds a serious key to the drama in the form of a broken harmonica belonging to ""Kana"". To say more would be a spoiler and this story needs to be followed,and enjoyed,step by step.
Probably one of the best offerings in anime this year and is most highly recommended,easily deserving the 5-Star rating.",1397001600,5,2358,5.1566579634464755
8621688,4,B00GB0ORUW,"The snack club at school is in trouble, the class president has resigned, a special election is being run to appoint a new president.  Unfortunately one of the front runners wants to do away with unnecessary clubs, and the snack club is on the block.
Enter club slacked Yuuki Oojima, forced to put aside his normal laziness, now he must run for president to save his club. Along with his childhood friend (and many believe girlfriend) Chisato,who runs his campaign, and the rest of the crazy cast of candy lovers must navigate the waters of the political world.
 Yuuki' s and Chisato' s friendship will be tested as it is put to tests the two never imagined. A beautiful but poor scholarship student who idolizes Yuuki for protecting her.  A beautiful and powerful presidential candidate who seems to genuinely be interested in Yuuki (also the one who wants to shut down his club), who is also the sister of his clubs drunken female sponsoring teacher.
  Tragic events from the past, hidden agendas, missing friends, and an internal conflict with the schools security division, that threaten to destroy not just the club, but Yuuki and Chisato as well.
  This is a romantic/comedy/drama.  Most of it is family appropriate, except for a bullying scene, a hit and run, and a kidnapping.
  This series is not really harem, although three girls are interested in the main, it more of a realistic situation when multiple people are interested in one.
  For those looking for ecchi harem, this is not your show. Minimal fan service, no nudity.  Some scenes seem to be leading towards ecchi, only to quickly derail and change course rapidly (to the confusion and dashed hopes of poor Yuuki).
  Not quite the epic of Clannad,  Love election & Chocolate will hold your interest. Good story, great characters, and an evolving story make for a excellent anime.",1389657600,6,1849,4.840764331210191
