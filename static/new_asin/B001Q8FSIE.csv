8335135,2,B001Q8FSIE,"Amazon US gives a complete review and synopsis of the film.

The film centers around Bernard (Jean-Louis Trintignant) an actor who gets involved with 17 year old Jane (Ewa Aulin). Jane's dad was recently killed in an auto accident. She thinks it was blackmail and murder. Prescott, the club owner shows up dead, Jane claims she didn't do it. She gets kidnapped by a ""midget"" and ransomed to her brother Jerome (Charles Kohler). The plot was a bit confusing and the actions taken by the characters stopped making any sense long ago.

The film has English subtitles and comments by Tinto Brass options.

Guide: No f-words. Brief nudity. Sex scenes were blurred with Vaseline on the lens, a popular effect that passes for art and overused by Penthouse Magazine.",1464652800,,758,4.8604651162790695
8335136,3,B001Q8FSIE,"A rather unusual agenda from Tinto Brass, who obviously found his later niche in ""T&A"" movies. Col cuore in gola (1967) is a psychedelic, pop art giallo that can just come from the great era of the late 60's/70's.

Starting from the nice credits and music you immediately like this film and this is just the beginning. Trintignant finds a corpse in a nightclub, beside the lovely Aulin who just says ""I wasn't it"". Convinced that she is innocent, he wants to help her and wants to find out the murderer. Aulin's brother should solve this case, as both are searching for him.

Though not quite without problems. The Story itself is not that convincing (rather unimportant).

But what here is really of interest is the unconventional style of Brass: split screen (even triple split screens) some scenes in black and dark yellow filter and more, and in the ""middle"" of course, the presence of two very convincing leads: cool Trintignant and hot Ewa Aulin (somehow priceless here in white fishnet stockings). The result is a quite ok giallo with (obviously) strong references to pop art.

In the same year Aulin and Trintignant appeared in the avant garde 1968 Giallo masterpiece ""Death Laid an Egg"", Col Cuore in Gola is not great as the Death Laid an Egg film but is definitely entertaining.",1386547200,,1289,4.766816143497758
8335137,5,B001Q8FSIE,"This fascinating, intriguing film from 1967 by renowned g I a l l o. filmmaker. T I n t o Brass, a wild mindbending ride whose brisk pace does not let up for an entire 99 minutes, features the film debut of Swedish beauty E w a A u l I n & the ever-enigmatic Jean Louis Trintignant & certainly has the look & sound of 1967, employing split screen, alternating between color and black-and-white & every plot element of true mystery, pitting the two characters against the police & the London underworld. Highly entertaining & highly recommended!",1376092800,2,544,4.561224489795919
8335138,3,B001Q8FSIE,"The director, Tinto Brass to me is like a 60's David Lynch, from Italy. His stories are as much about images as they are plot. Ewa Aulin is a mystery woman that leads all men to trouble and it is told in a stylized way. not for every taste.",1297468800,,240,3.9183673469387754
8335139,4,B001Q8FSIE,"Tinto B. as others have pointed out really hit his stride with softcore flicks a few years after this one. They have style and plots and are great films of their types , I don't collect those really but I do collect giallos, lots of them, the sixties were the first decade of them and the real gore and sleaze hadn't come around yet, this one has style and murders though. It's more colorful than the later giallos from the seventies which were more straightforward usually, with exceptions though like 'lizard in a womans skin""  etc.  At this point the seventies style of more gruesome killings had yet to be seen. Dario Argento did start this with 'the bird with the crystal plummage' in 69 but this was before that and is more in line with the sexy  pychedelic 60's type of flick.  I enjoyed this one and if you realize that this is from 1967 and therefore is going to more popish and colorful than later giallos then you will enjoy this.  Giallos were only four years old at this point maybe and this one is aimed at the time it came from. Nudity was not exploding yet and wouldn't for a few years. So you get a murder mystery that would appeal to audiences of the time who hadn't seen what was too come.  The print looks great, and more companies need to release giallos with better prints like this one. The actors did a great job on this one too Ewa Aulin and Tintignant are engaging and fun in this flick as well.",1290384000,3,1421,4.323308270676692
8335140,4,B001Q8FSIE,"For those people out there who thought director Tinto Brass only made movies about female bottoms, you will be pleasantly surprised with this gem.  Cult Epics should be congratulated for releasing this wonderful hommage to Giallo films, comic books, swinging sixties London and Humphrey Bogart.  Movie fans who loved Mario Bava's 'Danger:Diabolik' and Roman Coppola's 'CQ' will love this film and Ewa Aulin never looked sexier. Quality is fair to good with bright vibrant colors and in 1.85 wide screen in its Italian language with English subtitles.  Also includes great audio commentary with Director Brass although sometimes his heavy accent is hard to decipher. Recommended",1268179200,3,677,5.428571428571429
8335141,4,B001Q8FSIE,"""Giallo"" is an Italian word meaning ""yellow,"" and is roughly analogous to the tern ""Noir"" (meaning ""Black"") used in Western film.  Both Giallo and Noir are the worlds of pulp fiction, of dangerous dames and heroes in over their heads on the fun from desperate villains.

Tinto Brass's ""Deadly Sweet"" (""Col Cuore in Gola"" or ""Heart in his Mouth"") is pure giallo fun, covering up a paper-thin plot (very loosely adapted from the novel by Sergio Donati) with a splashy veneer of 60s pyschedilia and pop-art inspired imagery. Director Tinto Brass was in his experimental phase, and ""Deadly Sweet"" is full of the innovative camera work that would appear later in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attraction-Nerosubianco/dp/B002E2QH18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attraction (Nerosubianco)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howl/dp/B0026LYMDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howl</a>.

The story begins at a party, where Bernard (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a French actor in town in London looking for work, has his eye on Jane (Ewa Aulin), a young, beautiful and rich girl who won't give Bernard the time of day.  A little later at the same party, Bernard stumbles upon a crime scene, with Bernard's business contact dead on the floor and right at the feet of that self-same heiress Jane.  Instead of turning her in, however, Bernard takes advantage of the situation to steal a kiss from Jane, then to pull her away promising to keep her safe and to uncover the real killers.  That is the opening into a world of blackmail. Midgets and all sorts of wild things

A big draw for ""Deadly Sweet"" is the presence of actress Ewa Aulin.  Aulin had won the title of Miss Teen Sweden in 1965 at age fifteen and later Miss Teen International in 1966.  Catching the eye of film producers with her stunning looks, Aulin started her film career in 1967 with a supporting role in ""Don Giovanni in Sicilia"" and then her first feature at age seventeen in ""Deadly Sweet.""  Aulin would go on the next year to star in the sex-comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candy/dp/B000059PPX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candy</a>&nbsp;with Marlon Brando and Ringo Starr, which remains a cult classic.

Brass also was clearly influenced by the comic book for ""Deadly Sweet,"" as many of the double- and triple- split panel shots attempt to replicate the comic book format.  This style has seen a resurgence in recent years, but started here first.  Along with the split-screens, Brass' innovations include working with color, flipping occasionally to black-and-white for dramatic emphasis.

Although Brass is most well-known for his emphasis on the female form and movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula/dp/B000TEUSJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula</a>, there is no real nudity to speak of in ""Deadly Sweet.""  Ewa Aulin is beautiful and shown off effectively in white fishnet stockings and mini-skirts, but her naked body is never on display. Just as in her follow-up film ""Candy"" it is all about the tease of what is not shown.

Both lead actors, Jen-Louis Trintignant and Ewa Aulin, would re-team for the giallo ""Death Laid an Egg"" which is admittedly a better film than ""Deadly Sweet"" but in a different way.",1267488000,4,3391,5.765531062124248
