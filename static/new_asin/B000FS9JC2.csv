2583354,5,B000FS9JC2,"It has been quite a long time since the ballet world has been blessed with a ballet duo the likes of Zakharova and Bolle.  Their ability to perform with technical excellence and emotional intensity is very rare--and breathtaking!  We are blessed with some nice releases on dvd by them(Swan Lake and La Bayadere).  Perhaps it is in Giselle that we can experience the most realistic portrayal of human emotion in ballet, and Zakharova and Bolle do not disappoint us!  This version has the most sizzling emotional intensity of any I have seen, both in act one and act two.  In act one Zakharova displays youthful warmth and innocence and in act two, intense love, pain, and grief.  Bolle also gives a very appropriate portrayal, showing real intensity throughout.  All the scenes are equally magnificent, as is the supporting cast.  It is a complete Giselle with the peasant pas de deux and all the group dances, as well as extensive choreography for Myrtha and the other wilis.  Finally, the music, costumes, and scenery are also of the highest standard.  The image quality and sound are likewise superb.  It is packaged with a booklet.  Unfortunately, there is no bonus material on the dvd.  This is definitely one of the finest Giselle performances on dvd.",1171152000,38,1256,4.867924528301887
2583355,2,B000FS9JC2,"Yvette Chauvire allowed them to use her name?  Incroyable!  The principals were better than the soloists and corps, but that wasn't a major achievement.  Only Myrtha came out with anything approaching glory at the end.  Roberto Bolle is a lovely cipher.  Svetlana Zakharova was someone of whom I had great hopes on the strength of her La Fille du Pharaon.  Was I in for a letdown.  Her Giselle is successful only in relation to her lamentable Odette/Odile.  Technically, she's exquisite when she isn't being sublime.  Her lack of emotional resonance renders all her accomplishments hollow.  I have seen live and on video Alicia Alonso, Carla Fracci, Dominique Khalfouni, and Natalia Makarova to name but a few, and in alphabetical order I hasten to note.  To none of the above can Svetlana hold a candle.  Alicia, largely blind and over 60 when I last saw her dance the role made more of it.  To be a dancer is one thing, to be an artist is quite another.  I found the narrative elements and the lighting design elements to be laughable in their inconsistency or flagrant disregard for the story.  At least we poor punters who pay our money for tickets or dvds deserve to have the sun come up at the end of Act II.  It's a simple enough lighting effect.  It's an important storytelling point.  Did we get one?  No.  Obviously it was too much trouble.  Again the camera was far too close to the action too much of the time, but it wasn't as choppy as in the Swan Lake.",1164326400,9,1467,4.5440613026819925
2583356,4,B000FS9JC2,"Zakharova's technique is so stunning in this, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. The balances in the act two adage were so breath taking, it was like watching something from heaven. That said, I also adored Zakharova's beautiful footwork and extension, as well as her arms, in this production. However, as other reviewers have previously stated, her expression is different from that of most Giselles. Whether or not this is a good thing one can't be entirely sure, and I think it is partly a matter of personal opinion. Whereas the Giselle of, say, Lopatkina and Ferri is volatile, emotional, and bursting with every emotion under the sun, Zakharova's Giselle is quiet, not quite self-assured, and only a little weepy. There isn't much of a change in her between Act 1 and Act 2, which was a little disappointing. I do, however, think she portrayed a more apt Giselle in the second act, given her ethereally subdued nature--but I still would have liked to see something more. Part of the enjoyment in Giselle is seeing this little happy peasant girl be put through the emotional ringer on every level and seeing her response--without her volatility, the story weakens.

Roberto Bolle, of course, had very beautiful technique, just like Zakharova, and they danced beautifully together. The way he holds her in the pas de deux's of the second act was so heartbreakingly lovely! Unfortunately, just like Zakharova, he didn't bring his full emotion to Albrecht. On paper, Albrecht seems to be a little formulaic and not the most exciting person, but what other Albrechts have brought to the role transformed it to that of the grief-stricken, mournful, pleading man that is so far away from modern times that he is fascinating to watch. While Bolle's technique was virtually flawless, he portrayed Albrecht in a very ""on paper"" sort of way; that is, he went from being flirtatious and romantic to slightly depressed, which was not the range one would expect from this cornerstone of ballet repertoire.

Myrtha was decent, although I still prefer the Myrtha in the Lopatkina/Mariinsky version, as this one doesn't match up in terms of being quite so, well--scary. One would imagine Myrtha to be a very frightening, almost awe-inspiring creature, and in this version she comes across almost more queen-like than frightening. While the regal approach would certainly be something to add to Myrtha's character, without any other emotion to support it, it seemed a little dry.

Overall, if you are a fan of ballet or not, this version of Giselle has some stunning dancing. It is a fine example of technique at it's top with Zakharova. The costumes are stunning as well, and there is a nice ambiance on the stage throughout. If it's a tip top performance of Giselle you seek, there are better out there with more expression--Uliana Lopatkina is still my personal favorite, although Ferri is excellent as well. So if the money is worth spending to see the technique, go for it. If it's the whole package you want, this isn't the best.",1160611200,13,3024,4.89083820662768
2583357,4,B000FS9JC2,"Allow me to admit right up front that I am a fan of Svetlana Zakharova, so perhaps this leaves me a bit biased. Her dancing is, as usual, nearly flawless. But she's not the sort of Giselle that leaves you startled at her violent mood swings. She's a much more subtle creature in this. In some respects, this is disappointing. Like my fellow reviewer, I too saw Diana Vishneva perform Giselle and she blew me away with her emotional range and expressivity in the role. But in that performance, Giselle also came off as something of a manic-depressive all the way through; she perhaps shifted gears too much. Svetlana's Giselle flows more smoothly from who she was in life into who she became in death, and that has a certain beauty to it. No, the madness scene was not on par with the best. But I liked that it was a bit stilted, slow and internalized; more like true madness brought on by betrayal. And her Act II pas de deux is just beautiful.

Roberto Bolle, whom I generally like, I found to be a lacking Albrecht. He and Svetlana always dance beautifully together (and look gorgeous together to boot), but if Svetlana's Giselle was subtle...then Roberto's Albrecht was downright clinical. He only showed two expressions in Act I: arrogantly flirty and exaggeratedly sorrowful. But no depth of true love. I also agree with other reviewers, Marta Romagna's Myrtha was a major disappointment. She looked almost bored to be there, and her dancing revealed no power or commanding presence whatsoever. She made it difficult to believe that she could ever command Svetlana, and thus made Giselle's defiance to save Albrecht look too easy.

Some aspects of this performance: the technique of Svetlana and Roberto, the raw emotion in the eyes of Hilarion, the beautiful sets and costumes, the (as ever) lush musical performance by the orchestra, make this worthy of viewing. But don't expect the best Giselle you've ever seen.",1159401600,10,1921,4.818181818181818
8126032,5,B000FS9JC2,"OK, did I love the entire production? No.
Frankly, the La Scala Corps de Ballet was really lacking (although they were much better in Act II), and the female soloists in were not very talented at all. There is one in the first Act that is almost painful to watch. But some of the other performances were SO good that the final evaluation is - Excellent.
Marta Romagna was actually one of the best Myrthas that I have seen. Strict, aloof, severe, and a good dancer (although that was perhaps in comparison to the other La Scala dancers). I saw some criticism of her, but I thought she was one of the bright spots.
The performance by Svetlana Zakharova was just outstanding. She played a shy, comely peasant girl falling in love perfectly. Then she was a wronged beauty driven mad in a realistic and engaging way. Really, her mad scene was fantastic - where did that hair come from? Afterwards, she portrayed an airy Wilis perfectly to me. And no one can even compare to her in technique. It is the little things in ballet that grab me in a classic. When Myrtha raises her from the grave, there are two beats just before Giselle becomes alive. I have never seen another Giselle make such a pronounced and precise bow just before she is brought 'to life'. It portrays an unearthliness to the motion that emphasizes the fact that she is becoming a Wilis. I liked too the unique full arabesques around Albrecht in Act II. I have seen Diana Vishneva in the role, and she is grand as well. In fact, I believe that Diana plays the awakening Wilis 'swirl' even better than Svetlana, but overall Sveta's performance just blew me away.
Roberto Bolle is also very good, but he does not compare well with his partner. Bolle is athletic and handsome, but the choreography I do not think did him justice. But if Sveta likes having him as a partner, he must be better than he showed in this ballet.
Was it Sveta's show? Yes. Is that reason enough to buy the DVD. Oh, yeah!",1456185600,,1956,4.466480446927374
8126033,5,B000FS9JC2,"I hadnt seen this ballet since I left Cuba and I enjoyed seeing it again .It reminded me a lot of the version that I am very familiar with.
The choreography and costumes are very good. Svetlana Zhakharova is very good as Giselle an outstanding ballerina and excellent acting. Bolle was much better than in The Swan Lake.
This DVD is a very good production.",1362268800,,356,4.492307692307692

8126036,4,B000FS9JC2,"The La Scala proudly presents Giselle, internationally renowned ballet choreographed by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot and music by Adolphe Adam. Worthy representative of Romanticism, Giselle excites women with their mushy love story, the beautiful and poor peasant girl who falls for a noble cad. The music captivates, is in the head and the choreography is a unique beauty. Success since its debut, there are plenty of dancers who danced Giselle and made it his warhorse.
  Svetlana Zakharova accepts the challenge of being Giselle. The Russian technique is remarkable, from an impressive solidity and security. Your beauty radiates throughout the stage, the maranjos drool. However lack a sense of character: she cares and dance, and does very well. But the emotion, the feelings are not always present. Alicia Alonso, the grande dame Cuban knew how to interpret Giselle. The strength and technique were not always present, but it's thrilling. Gave himself body and soul to character, danced and acted. Svetlana Zakharova, however, forget the character of Giselle. Often seems distant, if not superficial. Can notability in Russian Ballet, his Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky borders on perfection. But when it comes to Giselle gets her due.
  Roberto Bolle makes a prince Albrecht monotonous. The handsome has the difficult role of showing the different facets of your character: passionate, sad, sorry, cold, warm. Very expressive and more concerned with the technique of ballet, so it Bolle, did not bother to show feelings. Its role is complex and requires the dancer's skill and great stage presence. Bolle owes.
  The queen of Willis, Myrtha, is danced by Marta Romagna. An icy coldness, worthy of the North Pole. Hillarion, the wronged and always faithful to the beloved, tries to warn the tricks Giselle Albrecht. If nobody gave good advice was, sold. She chooses the handsome nobleman, save it and still leave the poor guy's Hillarion be ousted by Willis. Vittorio D'Amato shows the faces of his character, despite the injustice and suffering, we must not anger him by letting the romance of pigeons flow. Mission accomplished. The corps de ballet of La Scala presents beautiful pessagens with precise timing.
  The quality of the sets and costumes is unique. Standard Scala quality. The orchestration of David Colleman is accurate. Adequate light and choreography following the original model, not inventions. The video was recorded in 2005, excellent image and sound.
 A video of a ballet of great plasticity, but lacked emotion to the soloists.

  O Scala de Milo orgulhosamente apresenta Giselle, bal de fama internacional com coreografia de Jean Coralli e Jules Perrot e msica de Adolphe Adam. Digno representante do Romantismo, Giselle emociona as mulheres com sua melosa histria de amor, da bela e jovem camponesa pobre que se apaixona por um nobre cafajeste. A msica cativa, fica na cabea e a coreografia  de uma beleza mpar. Sucesso desde a estria,  existem inmeras bailarinas que danaram Giselle e fizeram dela seu cavalo de batalha.
  Svetlana Zakharova aceita o desafio de ser Giselle. A tcnica da russa  notvel, de uma solidez e segurana impressionante. Sua beleza irradia por todo o palco, os maranjos babam. Falta no entanto o sentimento da personagem: ela se preocupa e danar, e o faz muito bem. Mas a emoo, as sensaes nem sempre esto presentes. Alicia Alonso, a grande dama cubana sabia como interpretar Giselle . A fora e a tcnica nem sempre estiveram presentes, mas ela emocionava. Entregava-se de corpo e alma a persongem, danava e atuava. Svetlana Zakharova, entretanto,  se esquece da personalidade de Giselle. Muitas vezes parece distante ,quando no superficial. Consegue notabilidade nos bals russos, seu O Lago dos Cisnes  de Tchaikovsky beira a perfeio. Mas quando o assunto  Giselle ela fica devendo.
  Roberto Bolle faz um prncipe Albrecht montono. O bonito tem o difcil papel  de  mostrar as diversas facetas de seu persongem: apaixonado, triste, arrependido, frio, caloroso. Pouco expressivo e mais preocupado com a tcnica do bailado, assim  Bolle, no se preocupou em mostrar os sentimentos. Seu papel  complexo e exige do bailarino tcnica apurada e grande presena cnica. Bolle fica devendo.
  A rainha das Willis, Myrtha,   danada por Marta Romagna. Uma frieza glacial, digna do Polo Norte. Hillarion, o sempre injustiado e fiel  amada,  procura alertar Giselle das artimanhas de Albrecht. Se conselho fosse bom ningum dava, vendia. Ela opta pelo nobre bonito, salva-o e ainda deixa o pobre coitado do Hillarion ser defenestrado pelas Willis. Vittorio D'Amato mostra as caras de seu persongem,  e apesar da injustia que sofre,  temos raiva por ele no deixar o romance dos pombinhos fluir. Misso cumprida. O corpo de baile do Scala apresenta belas pessagens com sincronia precisa.
  A qualidade dos cenrios e figurinos  nica. Padro Scala de Milo de qualidade. A orquestrao de David Colleman  precisa. A luz adequada e a coreografia segue o modelo original, sem invenes. O vdeo foi gravado em 2005, imagem e som excelentes.

8126037,5,B000FS9JC2,"I put off buying this DVD for quite some time because of some of the negative reviews, but I finally decided to chance it and see for myself.  I'm glad I did.  I can understand most of the complaints by some of the other reviewers, though I think in all instances they are too severe.  This is now the favourite of my many Giselles.  I could do with a few less close-ups than provided, though I am happy with the amount of time spent showing the dancers's whole body and the work of the corps.  I was impressed by the lead and found her in no way antiseptic.  Her peasant girl demeanour was charming, her mad scene was wonderful, her ability to be both spirit and humanly present was gently convincing.  Bolle strikes me as someone who might be more at home in a more extrovert part, but that makes his performance all the more appreciated for what he actually gives us.  I do find conversion for him at the end of Act 1 and throughout Act 2, but it's the conversion of this particular personality, not someone else's.  The only real short-coming I found in his acting was for a few moments in Act 2 during which he ceases to be Albrecht and becomes an attentive support to his partner in their pas de deux.  Before and after those few moments he is in character.  I am perfectly capable of being disappointed by a Myrthe - and have been - but not here.  In fact, I enjoyed this Myrthe very much - especially some lovely ""swan-like"" arm movements that softened the avenging fury aspect of the character.  There were still a few traces of humanity left in this Myrthe and it was a gain overall.  The choreography of this production had some carefully worked out touches that made sense of the story and helped the story make sense, in both acts, in a way which makes other productions just a little more forced or stilted.  SO - will this be your favourite ""Giselle""?  I haven't a clue.  All I can say is that this is, over-all, the most affecting of all the ones I own; and I think I will continue to have a soft spot in my heart for it for as long I manage to hold on.  These things are so personal that, really, the only way to know what you'll feel for this production is either to rent it first or simply take the plunge and buy.  But I repeat:  I'm extremely glad I did buy it, and it is now my favourite.  There are other performances in which various aspects might individually please me more, but this is the one that throughout, and in every way, gives me the most pleasure.",1229385600,11,2483,4.285407725321888
8126038,5,B000FS9JC2,"I've just begun collecting Ballets on DVD. And will look for more. I like Ivy Lin's reviews and will take her advice whenever possible. So far, my favorite Giselle is Karen Kain partnered with Frank Augustyn. She is just as beautiful as Svetlana Zakharova and young enough to carry off the roll of a young girl looking for a husband. I do not think Ivy LIN has reviewed Karen's version of Giselle and I really purchased it because it was offered with ""The Sleeping Beauty"" (Starring Rudolf Nureyev and Veronica Tennant) as a two ballet DVD. ""Beauty"" was a terrible disappointment, but ""Giselle"" was a gem, and now I am collecting Her too....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-Giselle-Karen-Kain-Frank-Augustyn-National-Ballet-of-Canada/dp/B00022LJ38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam - Giselle / Karen Kain, Frank Augustyn, National Ballet of Canada</a>...OR....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giselle-The-Sleeping-Beauty/dp/B000MX1P6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giselle The Sleeping Beauty</a>

First impressions (Karen Kain) have such an impact on the mind that I might have been biased while viewing the La Scala version, as I too felt something was lacking. After reading reviews by Ivy Lin and others, I understand what was lacking. Chemistry and emotion must be presented on stage or on film in order that the viewer might shed a tear or two if he or she are not too ashamed to show emotion. I couldn't shed a tear for Svetlana, either at her death scene or in the end when she was returning to her grave, which was done very well with her being lowered seemingly into the earth. But, Karen made me cry.

The sets in this production were good, but again, not as good as in the Canadian production, where especially in the forrest, the set was spectacular with fog rolling in off the lake in the background and the trees were covered with something that looked like ice or snow and/or cobwebs. It was very eerie, going well with the theme of the Willis. The La Scala forrest was not eerie at all. But, being a live production they did not have the liberties that the Canadian filmers had. There was, by the way a hint of daybreak (I believe someone suggested there was none) when a glow of light was shown on the little church in the background and on the tombstone, which had the nice touch of having Giselle's name carved on it. I'm going to give this production a five star rating because I do not know enough about ballet to call any performance bad nor am I mean enough, as some folks seem to be.",1216771200,4,2582,5.1746411483253585
8126039,5,B000FS9JC2,"A wonderful performance; beautiful Svetlana is a ballerina asoluta; she is perfect in every way and very, very, beautiful. Roberto Bolle is a great danceur. The recording, itself, was of very good quality.

8126040,3,B000FS9JC2,"First off, I don't know what is going on with the filming of ballet these days.  Again, but this time it is not the Bolshoi rather La Scala, whose camera person is cutting off critical footwork performed by the artists.  I just don't understand this new form of filmography that appears to be coming out of Europe and Russia, and that is why this performance only gets 3-stars.  What is lacking in this ballet are two things: first, Myrtha by Marta Romagna is awful--she doesn't even appear to make an effort to exert any energy to extend her technical performance.  Second, the score used by the orchestra is extremely lacking which undermined the effect of the on and off again brilliant performances by Zakharova and Bolle.  Here, I must say that I was extremely impressed with Bolle's performances.  But again, as with Romagna, there are moments where he appears unwilling to exert that extra bit of energy required to extend his performance to bring him within par range of Baryshnikov's peformance.  But Bolle is a brilliant technician, that, there is no doubt.  There are moments such as these also with Zakharova's performance, especially in the famous variation of Giselle in the second act, which was so underwhelming I almost didn't recognize it! But in general, I enjoyed the ballet, but with a great deal of disappoointment.  I will return to my benchmark performance of Giselle by the American Ballet with Makharova and Baryshnikov.  If only the latter were as vividly filmed as this one is and was available on DVD!!!",1196467200,6,1532,4.857692307692307
