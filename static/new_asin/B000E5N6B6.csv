2496978,5,B000E5N6B6,"I hate to disappoint everyone. I am not going into who does what to who, etc. I find The Triangle a dang good show and am looking forward to it being on DVD!!!!",1142121600,6,160,3.878787878787879
2496979,4,B000E5N6B6,"The latest in a growing line of slick miniseries produced by the Sci-Fi Channel, Dean Devlin and Bryan Singer's The Triangle draws from a number of standard sci-fi story elements in an effort to provide an original take on a tired enigma.  While the miniseries concerns itself with a mystery long celebrated as unsolvable, The Triangle keeps itself from descending into maddening vagueness by demanding concrete answers from both its characters and its story.  That's not to say this story is not enigmatic, but this is a brain-teasing puzzle with a surprising solution.  Writer Rockne S. O'Bannon should be commended.  The Bermuda Triangle here is more intriguing than it has ever been, kept entertaining by the slow revealing of the shadowy sources of its power.  The threat escalates as the film progresses and scientific theories--ranging from wormholes to alternate realities to exotic matter--are blended into an engaging, reality-threatening cataclysm of apocalyptic proportion.  At the outset, single ships are threatened but by the time of the paradoxical climax, the globe hangs in the balance.  The inevitable time-travel is elegantly handled amidst all of this and the endgame is both intelligent and stunning.

The acting here is above average, too, and each of the leads elevates not only their character's role but the film's believability as well.  Eric Stoltz, Bruce Davison, Catherine Bell, and Michael E. Rodgers are excellent as a team of unique experts in unusual fields of study.  Keeping the story emotionally grounded is Lou Diamond Phillips, whose individualized subplot allows us to experience the film's reality-altering oddness through the eyes of an everyman.  The miniseries is beautifully produced, nicely photographed, and the considerable visual effects are always impressive.  More importantly, those effects are used primarily to service the story's intricacies, not as a means of distracting from plot holes.  In fact, The Triangle's most serious flaws are those extended scenes echoing science fiction clichs for suspense or drama, chunks of the narrative that will seem all-too familiar--and perhaps, as a result, all-too dull--for fans of the genre.  Conspiracy plotlines wear thin too quickly, the quirks of Davison's psychic irritate as they escalate, and Sam Neill's obsessed magnate is instantly forgettable.  At those moments when the film is successful, however, it plays off of our curiosity and becomes quite gripping.  Viewers have set-out on this sort of strange sea voyage before, but Devlin and Singer manage to make it smart and sexy.  The Triangle does make something old new again; the three-part miniseries takes a host of familiar pseudo-scientific theories and science fiction themes and finds a way to recombine them into something that feels, for the most part, fresh.

2497258,4,B000E5N6B6,"To enjoy this movie you must be able watch Sci-Fi for the sake of Sci-Fi without all the modern special effects. This is not to say there are no special effects, but this is not Star Trek or Star Wars for that matter.  Or you must be slightly interested in the history and cause of the phenomenon commonly know as the Bermuda Triangle. But even if neither of those two reasons apply then maybe you should consider these: (1) You get over four hours of entertainment in this 2-disc dvd suspense thriller. (2) This screenplay is excellent and will stand the test of time for all ages. (3) All of the actors do a very good job many of whom will be familiar faces as role players in other movies which you have enjoyed. Sam Neil, Lou Diamond Phillips, Catherine Bell and Eric Stoltz, just to name a few. (4) There are dimensional shifts and flashback which add a new twist to keep you on the edge of your seats trying to follow along and guess the outcome of this drama. My whole family enjoyed it and we have watched it more than once.

2497265,2,B000E5N6B6,"Warning: discussion of ending.....I enjoyed this movie, until the last hour when it just fell apart.  It was as if they ran out of time and were not quite sure what to do.  Our four scientists suspect that the Navy is responsible for the triangle.  The Secretary of the Navy confirms this, explaining that it occurred because of the Philadelphia Experiment.  This is inconsistent, not only with the actual stories surrounding the triangle, but also with how the triangle is presented at the beginning of the film, when we are introduced to Christopher Columbus' encounter with the triangle.  If the triangle was created by the Philadelphia Experiment in the 1940's, it is highly unlikely that Christopher Columbus would have encountered it  in the 1490's.

Then at the end, our four scientists believe that the Navy's attempt to stop it will result in total annihilation.  The scientists tell the Secretary of the Navy what they believe, but he refuses to stop.  We hear the countdown.  He does not give the order to stop the process.  Then all of a sudden the triangle which has been expanding, reverses itself and everyone is all smiles because they stopped it.  Who stopped it.  As far as I can tell, the scientists were wrong in their conclusion that the navy's method of stopping the triangle would cause total annihilation.  If the Navy, listened to the scientists and didn't proceed, they may not have made the phenomenon worse, but it certainly would not have done a total reverse, especially so quickly.

This all led to a very juvenile and disappointing ending to this film.",1402704000,,1584,4.858208955223881

People disappear. 16th century galleons turn up. Sharks hang upside down.

The premise of this is just brilliant... until it gets to the final episode. It all just seemed to fall apart at this point, and the series of contrivances were just too much.

2497329,5,B000E5N6B6,"The Triangle was a miniseries that aired on the Scifi Channel in 2005 that tells the story of four strangers, who are called together by Eric Benirall, a shipping tycoon billionaire who has lost numerous ships to the Bermuda Triangle. He hopes these four (with the help of a Greenpeace volunteer who survived an encounter in the Triangle) will discover what is happening, but as they work together and dig deeper, a conspiracy that dates back decades begins to be uncovered, and the very fabric of time and space soon starts to unravel. Will they find out what is happening before the universe is lost?

The Triangle is a truly fantastic and wonderful voyage into the unknown, with stunning visual effects and great performances from the cast all around. Bryan Singer (Valkyrie, X-Men) and Dean Devlin (Independence Day, Stargate) worked together with director Craig R. Baxley on this high-end miniseries that offers a very unique and creative look at why the Triangle is the way it is. Starring Eric Stoltz, Sam Neil, Bruce Davidson and Catherine Bell, The Triangle is a 3-part miniseries that deserves a spot in any sci-fi lover's collection. I just hope someone talks to Lionsgate about re-releasing this and other miniseries' that are on DVD because some features are missing, the audio is a little scruffy in places and picture quality on a big screen TV looks very grainy.

Unless our three hero/one heroine team comes up with a solution to the problem, the world will never be the same. Never mind.

2497394,4,B000E5N6B6,"You do roll the dice with the Sci-Fi Channel when it comes to their made-for-television movies. Mostly, you come up snake eyes. But, every now and then, you land a seven. THE TRIANGLE is one of the good ones, and the hefty budget shows up on screen. THE TRIANGLE features a cast of familiar names. The writing/producing pedigree is solid, what with Bryan Singer and Dean Devlin having co-conspired with the crafting of the story. Teleplay credit goes to Rockne O'Bannon.

This mini-series ran for three nights and goes for an epic near four and a half hours, which is a lot of bathroom breaks for a decrepit old bloke like me. I don't think there's anyone out there not clued in to the Bermuda Triangle mystique, and certainly there's familiar terrain covered in this sci-fi thriller. But Singer, Devlin, and O'Bannon keep things interesting and pace the story well. The key lies in the first episode of the mini-series, whether it hooks you in. It sets up the plot, creates a genuinely gripping air of mystery, and introduces the five core actors. By the end of this opening chapter, you're either tantalized and willing to follow these five characters or you don't tune in the next night.

A shipping magnate contracts four experts in various fields to investigate why his cargo vessels are mysteriously vanishing in the Sargasso Sea, known more notoriously as the Bermuda Triangle, site of abrupt disappearances of uncountable ships and souls down the centuries. A deep ocean resource engineer (Catherine Bell), a maverick meteorologist (Michael Rodgers), a psychic (Bruce Davison), and a tabloid journalist (Eric Stoltz) all jump at the chance to make five million dollars each, and there's a thought that perhaps all they would have to do is amass a wealth of mumbo-jumbo facts and engage in double speak and dazzle the shipping magnate and, in that manner, earn their sexy paychecks. Except that things abruptly get X-FILES-y. It's not long before the quartet are fully engaged, thoughts of paychecks shoved to the back of the mind. Getting a peek at things beyond the ken of man will do that.

We also get a running perspective from a survivor (Lou Diamond Phillips) of yet another baffling phenomena in the Sargasso Sea, and in a lot of ways Meeno Paloma's is the most personal story arc. Meeno returns home after a hospital stint only to find that little things aren't adding up, which eventually leads to big things not adding up. It begins with a wrong-colored truck and escalates to the appearance of a young son who didn't before exist.

No one escapes the Bermuda Triangle's spooky influence. Our four investigators eventually begin suffering hallucinations, or what they believe are hallucinations but are actually windows into alternate realities. Ultimately, the fate of the world rests on their and on Meeno Paloma's ability to solve the riddle of the Bermuda Triangle. And, then, at the end of it, there's the epilogue which plays out nicely, which deals with the fallout of our characters' actions. There's a balance in how the characters' fortunes have changed, some for the better, some not so much. Just like you roll the dice when you tune in to a Sci-Fi Channel program, you do the same when you eff around with the space/time continuum.

Government conspiracy. Crazy military experiments. Warped realities. Time travel. A race against time. The Nia, the Pinta, the Santa Maria... The Devil's Triangle is bounded by its three points: Miami, Bermuda, and San Juan. It encompasses 14,000 square miles. Surely, within those desolate, sprawling confines, a lot of things are possible. Including Eric Stoltz and Lou Diamond Phillips anchoring the film with their rather terrific acting. So, good performances, excellent production values, a script that engages and is taut and doesn't insult your intelligence. What?

The type that I am familiar with as a former visitor to Georgia's Buford triangle formed by the intersection of I-985 and I-85. Here drivers can get lost for hours and when they emerged they seem to be hours older.

Shipping tycoon Eric Benirall (Sam Neill) has been losing ships and we suspect more than that.

2497411,4,B000E5N6B6,"It wasn't overly apparent at the time, but 2005 is quickly becoming a year known for its primetime science fiction television.  Don't take my words for it- you could sit down and watch Lost, Surface, Invasion, Threshold, and The 4400 without having to endure a single rerun.  SyFy, back then the SciFi Channel, understood that the world at large was suddenly celebrating what was supposed to be their niche and came out swinging with a miniseries created by and starring some serious heavy hitters.

Enter The Triangle, a 255-minute picture that reads like a Hollywood blockbuster rather than a made-for-television miniseries.  Written by the powerhouse trifecta Bryan Singer (of the first two X-Men films, Superman Returns and the upcoming Battlestar Galactica film), Dean Devlin (Independence Day and Stargate), and living legend Rockne O'Bannon (Farscape and Alien Nation), the production crew was certainly taking no shorts.  The cast, it would turn out, would be no less qualified to deliver the goods.

The story centers on billionaire shipping magnate Eric Benirall (played perfectly by Jurassic Park's Sam Neill) who has a record of losing ships in the Bermuda Triangle.  In addition to the resulting financial loss, he begins experiencing troubling hallucinations.  Having enough with the mystery, he assembles a motley group of ""experts"" to provide a reasonable explanation for the mysteries haunting the Bermuda Triangle for centuries.

This team consists of tabloid reporter Howard Thomas (Eric Stoltz) a skeptic who only takes the assignment to help make his alimony payments; engineer and overeducated Emily Patterson (played by JAG's Catherine Bell); Stan Lathem (Bruce Davison) a struggling psychic; thrill seeker and Hugh Jackman wannabe Bruce Geller (Michael Rodgers); and finally Greenpeace commando Meeno Paloma (Lou Diamond Phillips) who returns from a disastrous trip through the triangle only to discover that reality is not how he remembers it.

So where does The Triangle succeed amidst a swarm of science fiction competition?  Surprisingly, in its pacing.  While a majority of the shows mentioned above were structured as ongoing dramas, The Triangle finds itself neither stretched out across twenty-two episodes nor compressed to fit into the 2-hour timeslot of a motion picture.  Instead, thanks to the miniseries format, it fits neatly between the two extremes with a runtime of roughly five-hours.  In other words, while movies often feel rushed and series tend to stretch out endlessly, The Triangle manages to capture the best of both worlds in its structure and this shows in viewing through brisk pacing and well-developed characters.

The 2-disc DVD set breaks the production down into the first two chapters of the series on the first disc and the final chapter on the second.  The second disc also includes a promotion spot originally aired on SyFy with interviews with the cast and crew and some light behind-the-scenes information.  It also contains several Lions Gate trailers ranging in genre from horror to dedicated science fiction.

The plot itself is pretty darn spot-on as well, with links and references that tie the Bermuda Triangle phenomena back to Christopher Columbus's famous trip across the ocean-blue on up to the Naval experiments of the 1940s (including the infamous Philadelphia Experiment).

The story works off the canvas created by shows like X-Files and Outer Limits in that the day to day tribulations of the lead characters is used as the catalyst to establish a much larger mystery.  And while calling some of the inscrutabilities here spooky may be overdoing it, in truth the presentation of the phenomena requiring investigation is done surprisingly well.  Sometimes in sci-fi less is more, and in this case, the filmmakers wisely combine slick visuals with just enough intrigue to let the viewer's imagination take hold to fill in the blanks.

The picture is nearly flawless, in my opinion anyway, throughout the first two sections but only drops the ball a bit in the third and final chapter.  The science is certainly plausible and the plot structure builds itself up into a nice appropriate fever pitch by the end, but the second half of the final segment is definitely the most ""Hollywood"" of the whole production.  Some of the concluding explanations could have been ironed out a bit better and the actual finale itself leaves viewers not entirely sure if the overall experience was satisfying through and through.  Perhaps the third part of the miniseries is the weakest simply because it is the only one of the segments that manages to hint toward the rush and tight scheduling that shooting on a television schedule implies.

In all, I found The Triangle to be an entirely enjoyable ride despite some slight shortcomings.  The talent that contributed to this miniseries is evident throughout and a testament to the fact that amazing things are possible, even on a television budget, when enthusiastic individuals bring their enthusiasm to the table.  And unlike many of the other hit science fiction television programs that saw the light of day in 2005, The Triangle ends conclusively; it's tough to put a value on the closure one finds in following along with a show that wasn't cancelled on an unresolved cliffhanger.",1276732800,17,5296,5.206124852767962

So I was hoping for something at least as good. This mini series did have high production values and the acting was first rate, but the story was a little mediocre. It was kind of a mishmash of other films and myths loosely pieced together. I kept waiting for something really cutting edge or a spectacular ending and was left disappointed. Although, unlike other reviews I think Lou Diamond Philips inclusion was necessary to give a more personal human element to the story and was not a drag or superfluous. The average viewer could have come up with improvements to the story, I found myself doing that as I watched, however, there's no point in saying what should've been in the story, it is what it is, but the writers really fell down on the job. I gave it 3 stars for the acting and good special effects, but it's a coin toss as far as purchasing.",1257292800,4,1003,4.456521739130435

And you've got a budget of $22 million (as compared with the usual SyFy budget of about, I believe, $1 million).

The story is engaging, fun and always keeps you guessing, hanging on for more.  The only character who doesn't seem to have much of a purpose (i.e. you might not need him) is the one played by Lou Diamond Phillips.  But that's not a big deal or distraction.

2497441,5,B000E5N6B6,"An excellent mini series, The Triangle, brings to the screen the story of an unlikely group of people brought together by a mysterious millionaire wishing to find out more about the Bermuda Triangle.
I started to watch this series with very low expectations and boy was I surprised! The series starts off with a bang, immediately catching the viewer's interest and attention and never letting go. The plot as a whole is excellent! It is so incredibly done that one feels that they have been transported away and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.
On the down side, initially I did not care much for Emily Paterson, the deep ocean resource engineer, though by the end of the series she had become quite likable.
Moreover, Bruce Geller, the Australian professor of meteorology seemed much more like a surfer than a university professor.
Additionally, for someone who just lost his son and daughter-in-law, and found out that his granddaughter is an old woman kidnapped by the Navy, grandpa is taking it pretty calmly (and so is grandma)!
Nevertheless, Lou Diamond Phillips, Sam Neil, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances. Very well written and very well presented, it combines drama, action, and adventure, making it a film guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!

Rodgers. There is also two South African actors in the series with brief roles: Marius Weyers, still with a thick South African accent after all these years and Hakeem Kae-Kazim, originally from Nigeria but primarily based in South Africa. I've met Hakeem a few times and he has awesome energy about him.

The plot is simple - it seems. A very rich shipping magnate Eric Benirall (Sam Neill) recruits a group of misfits that include a journalist for a tabloid, a deep ocean resource engineer, a man with genuine psychic abilities and Meteorology professor. They band together in desperate times as they find weird coincidences or as Freud called them uncanny happenings. On the surface it seems straightforward, Benirall's company controls about 1/5th of all ships on the sea at any given time through his cargo company and has lost 6 ships in a short space of time. Later on more deeper reasons emerge as it turns out Benirall lost a brother in the Bermuda Triangle. Each one of the main cast have personal circumstances which adds depth to their characters. The navy it turns out is building a huge machine to counter the effects of the infamous Philadelphia Experiment, in which a ship allegedly disappeared in a scientific experiment in 1943. Please Google this name and read more about it. It has been an integral part of many conspiracy theories over the decades.

The whole mystery around the Burmuda Triangle is very interesting in itself.  The movie presents several possibilities as to what is causing the disappearances of ships and planes in this area.  I found them to be facinating whether or not any of them are true.  Bottom line here -- this movie is interesting all of the way through.",1182297600,4,669,4.346774193548387
2497473,3,B000E5N6B6,"Hyped as the first co-production of Bryan Singer (Director of X-Men) and Dean Devlin (producer and writer of Independence Day) this should be a sci-fi spectacular. Alas, while a satisfying enough diversion for a while, it does not tread any new ground, ideas, or benchmarks in sci-fi.

The story revolves more around technobabble than character development, despite some fine acting from almost all involved. Sam Neill is a multi-millionaire shipping magnate who offers a huge sum to a disparate group of experts to solve the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle. As time goes by, it becomes clearer that his motivation is more personal than he at first admits, and that there is a time constraint, as things head from mystery to countdown to disaster.

An interesting subplot revolves around the excellent Lou Diamond Phillips, who is one of the victims, experiencing alternate realities as a result of his encounter with the Triangle. Did I say alternate realities..? Yes, you'll have to get used to listening to theories on `exotic matter', `parallel universes', `ripples in space time', `government conspiracies' and `electromagnetic disturbances'.. however the end does tie things together - with the help of a substantial dose of belief suspension. In fact, the ending is just a little too neat and ideal to be truly satisfying. That said, there are plenty of interesting ideas here to keep this fresh enough to be worth viewing.

The effects are just up to small screen standard, but never believable enough to make you forget they are special effects. However the acting is, for the most part, excellent, and it is this, particularly from Phillips and from Eric Stolz, that help us suspend belief to make this mini series work.

Over the disc we get the three episodes, each just under 1  hours, plus some interview snippets with the principals and a making of documentary.

Overall, at the price offered by Amazon, well worth a buy, as long as you do not keep too high expectations. Fine acting, good pitch of an idea, but not so impressive in execution of story.",1172361600,4,2067,4.959537572254336

2497476,4,B000E5N6B6,"The Triangle Starring Catherine Bell:

The Triangle was a Science Fiction mini-series made by the producers of ""Independence Day"" and ""X-Men"" exclusivly for the ScFi Channel (Should tell you something right there)

this is a story about the Bermuda Triangle and about one man's quest to find out why his ships are disappearing there and so he goes forth to assemble a team of ""experts"" to go out and find out the answer to his questions ""With absolute proof"" and if they accomplish this task they will each get five million dollars each.

so he gathers a team that consist of 4 people: a meteorologist/adventureer, a has-been psychic,a skeptical tabloid reporter and an Oceanography engineer. also there is a character in a side story about a Greenpeace voleenteer who was the only survivor of his sinking boat while battling a whaling ship that also sank that took place in the Triangle due to the Triangle.

the movie was 6 hours long and was in three parts. on the dvd it is four hours and fifteen minutes - but it is still in 3 parts. the opening segment was great. i loved it. i bought the whole thing especially when they kept going to the story of the survivor of the greenpeace boat and his struggles with coping with being the only suvivor and the effect of the Triangle itself had on him. it was a great story, Lou Damond Phillips played him very well. i wish they focused more on him at times throught the movie.

however, as the movie went along the more it was hard to believe. there were some great and sometimes powerful images and scenes throughout the whole thing but as it went along towards the end it was getting to caught up in itself. the writers were too into it and obviously loved the ""Nerdy/Geek"" Science fiction and wanted all to know it. towards the end you knew who there audience was it was no longer for the causual viewer.

i found the characters, dialogue and even the special effects were cliched.i have seen other movies like this do the same damn thing. they showed me nothing new in the story of the Bermuda Triangle. as a matter of fact i found it offensivly the opposite.

i felt that they could have told a better story with just one or two characters then five. it made no sense. i don't why they needed the tabloid reporter. it wasn't like he was the narrorator of the story.

at first i found the Special effects appropriate and well done. but as the movie went on they seemed like they wanted to do them just because they could and they began to look hokey and cartoonish - very out-of-place as they came to the conclusion. the theories they picked to explain the triangle was at first believable but they kept changing it to where they -i guess- picked all of them and decided to painfully explain them all using polysyllabic words to make it sound intellegent leaving nothing for the audience to figure out for themselves even if we could understand it. and by the way, a lot of what they said in the film was wrong. they said the Alantic ocean had the deepest water. not true. it the pacific. i think around the coral sea. (an example)

but inspite of all this. there are moments that are very good and outside the box of cookie cutter ScFi (not much though) it was well casted. everyone did a good job with what the had to work with and so i will give this a fair to good rating. but i guess it is for people like the Nerdy/Geeky ScFi die-hard fans who more interested in the psedo-science and the hard to believe fiction in their ScFi. or for people like me a Catherine Bell fan. and this was her movie.

Catherine Bell plays a strong woman (on ScFi standards) named Emily Patterson, an Oceanography engineer who was recruited to join the team to figure out the mysteries of the triangle.

Catherine Bell Played her well. She Radiates here. she is the Focual point when ever she's on camera. she breathtaking and she holds her own with the rest of the great cast and even betters them. my favorite scene of hers is the one with her real mother who is not really there but in another timeline with her. (Don't even ask me to explain it.) there sitting in her kitchen, having dinner. the room is lit with candles and thunderstorm is going on outside. it a very conversational scene. they are bonding. Emily ask her mother what her name is then asked her whay she put her up for adoption (in her timeline) her mother, understandly has no idea what she's talking about. i think that was a good piece of acting by catherine. i was moved. it was a sweet scene. well done-paced. it is probably my favorite scene in the whole movie. scenes like that are peppered throughtout the movie. but most come and go and them it get ridicules again.

i think this was Catherines best effort. but it was done on a pretty much wasted movie. but i own the a copy of it. i will probably watch it again. but mainly for CatBell. because of her it is worth it.",1162598400,5,4884,4.420467185761957

Lou Diamond Phillips had a part in it, and it was the best thing I'd ever seen him do.  He played a Greenpeace warrior who lost his comrades when their boat sank in the Triangle.

Then he comes home again another day and finds the house empty with a For Sale outside...  Now, he ready to kill himself because he doesn't understand what's going on.  Each ""environment"" was caused by a ""wave"" projected out of the Triangle (which is expanding).  It disrupts time and space, letting people slip from one multi-verse to another without realizing it at first... Because the first part and some of the twists and performances were good, I'm giving it a C+.

The special effects are insane (and there's more of them here than in X-men 2!)And the scientific quality of the movie is way above par for most sci-fi films of the last decade! Basically everyone involved is awesome.

Let me add another element here too. I have studied the Bermuda Triangle most of my life. I know all the theories, and this series manages to touch on all of them, while creating an entirely new and unpredictable explanation for the phenomena. The idea is highly unlikely naturally, but fascinating. It may help to be familiar with the subject so to speak, but even without, this is a mind-bending event. There are a plethora of paradoxes that work, ironies and events that are recurrent enough to keep everything tight and consistent. I think for anyone paying attention, this is a cinematic event that pays the viewer well for their time. In fact, as a huge cinemaphile, i think this mini-series is the best thing i've seen all year. Certainly better than any of the recycled drivel Hollywood had pumped out.

I did the latter and while there are some interesting variations on the Bermuda Triangle theories, there are spots that drag and the plot sometimes gets a little muddled.  A tie in with the Philadelphia Experiment is intriguing, but the subplot with Lou Diamond Phillips seems superfluous; excluding his character might have tightened up the film somewhat.  Eric Stoltz, Bruce Davison, Sam Neill, Catherine Bell and Michael Rodgers do well in their leading role with Scottish actor Rodgers standing out in his roguish role.

Also, Lithuania is definately NOT land locked, again, surprising for the ""four degrees"". I can probably add at least 10 more (like diving at 30 meters depth without decompressing), but let's not go into such detail. It's a movie after all...

When a 747 goes down into the area and they investigate they discover the plane looks like its been submerged for fifty or sixty years. When they come back from the region they begin having strange experiences suggesting that reality has somehow been altered for them.

A fun diversion, ""The Triangle"" comes with a good pedigree; it's written by Rockne O'Bannon who created ""Farscape"" based on a story by O'Bannon, Bryan Singer (director of ""The X-Men"", ""Superman Returns"" and ""The Usual Suspects"")and Dean Devlin (co-producer and writer of ""Independence Day"" and ""Stargate""). These three come up with a unique story that is an involving and fascinating puzzle.

Lion's Gate has the mini-series on two discs with a play all feature for the episodes. There's also a promotional featurette that ran on the Sci-Fi Channel included. The extras are disappointing to say the least with no commentary track, no featurettes on the production (outside of the promo one)or the visual effects on the show. The image quality of the series is top notch throughout most of the set although some of the night scenes could have used a bit more contrast.

Overall this is a fine mini-series with some top notch performances that recalls ""The X-Files"" in terms of the strong plotting and mystery.

8106261,4,B000E5N6B6,"This would be a five-star rating, but the subtitles are so far out of sync, it's nearly impossible to follow, still running from one scene into the next. There also seems to be a lot of missing dialog. I understand from another review the audio is also far out of sync. Have not yet tried asking Amazon to correct.",1512345600,,314,4.338983050847458

8106266,2,B000E5N6B6,"Could be awesome, could be fascinating. Could be riveting. Geez, just look at the cast list, which is incredible! Unfortunately, at least for me, the sound quality was poor (not because of my equipment), so I turned on Captioning (CC). That made it worse, as the Captions were 20-30 seconds BEHIND the spoken dialog. When I saw what they said when their lips moved, we were already into the next scene. CC provided by Lions Gate, HORRIBLE! I spent so much time and energy just trying to follow the verbal script that I could not appreciate the story, writing, and acting. I will be asking Amazon for an improved delivery or a full refund. Having said the above, I thought the acting was, at least, good or better. Writing the same. Worth a watch, if the sound, or CC, are improved. Interesting story.",1507852800,,800,4.601398601398602
