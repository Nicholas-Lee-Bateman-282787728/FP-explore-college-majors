2171660,2,B00067BBMS,"The actual story was really very aggrevating and somewhat confusing as the director couldn't quite decide if he wanted to tell it in a linear fashion or in a more Pulp Fiction - Taratino type way.

Basically it's a stalker movie that comes off romantic and sad instead of insane. The only true bright spot in this movie is Matthew Lillard's acting and character - though Lisa/Alex was also really very good in her part as was the real Lisa. Josh Hartnett is the only actor that probably should have been re cast. He didn't quite have that childlike charisma to carry off this role. In several scenes he was just sort of creepy.

The story is told from present to flashbacks to present - not really done coherently. Mostly from Josh H's POV but at the end the audiencce gets a fill in the blank moment with a POV from the person who had ultimately been manipulating events as well as Lisa's.

The premise was shaky just because there is an invention called the cell phone (which no 20 something in this day and age is without). Plus - at the end - this really bothered me - NO ONE HAD CALL WAITING during a point where all four of the main characters were trying to call each other. Also - I don't live there - but does Chicago have any season but winter? From watching this movie, I wouldn't think so...

Trailers give the impression that this is going to be a psychological thriller - not so.  More of a - will he ever find her? type of film. Though I admit to not caring by the end - I just wanted him to go to China. He seemed a bit stalkerish and obsessive. I couldn't really care about him - though I felt terrible for Matthew Lillard's character.",1094515200,4,1652,4.29903536977492

At tiems i felt confused on what was happening and when, but thats what makes a movie fun for me, when you have to think to understand and not just watch.",1094342400,,326,3.9242424242424243
2171662,4,B00067BBMS,"This film vacillates between romance, mystery and occasional flashes of humor, and the story is accompanied by a varied and sometimes overly loud sountrack. It is simultaneously a story of lost opportunities, the search for closure, and the pursuit of a dream (or is it a romantic obsession?) sequenced in an interesting and clever manner by Director Paul McGuigan. It is almost two hours in length and the storyline takes shape slowly at the beginning, so a theatergoer should be prepared for it to take a while to become involved with the characters and for the pace to accelerate.

The movie opens with Matt (Josh Hartnett) rushing to a Chicago restaurant to meet his girlfriend and her family before he is scheduled to leave for Shanghai on a business trip. (He is employed by his girlfriend's brother.)  Luke (Matthew Lillard), an old friend who does not know that Matt has returned to Chicago from living in NYC, spots him on the street as he is about to enter the restaurant and Matt promises that they will get together when he returns from China. While making a visit to the restroom after using the pretext of the need to make a phone call (apparently he doesn't own a cell phone) when the discussion of marriage was brought up, Matt accidentally overhears a phone conversation involving a woman who apparently fears for her safety. Once he concentrates upon the call, he is convinced it is the voice of his former girlfriend Lisa, who mysteriously disappeared overnight two years ago. Her unexplained absence after failing to meet her for a planned rendezvous in WICKER PARK caused the heartbreak which resulted in his decision to move to NYC. The woman rushes from the restaurant before he can confront her, but he finds a hotel key left folded in a newspaper in the phone booth. One of the few predictable moments in the movie occurs when Matt decides he has to attempt to locate the woman and determine if it is indeed Lisa, with whom he is still obsessed.

So, Matt's odyssey begins. He enlists Luke's help, who is of course stunned that Matt would postpone his business trip and take the chance of completely ruining his current relationship. However, in a flashback we soon discover that Luke played a significant role in Matt's initial meeting with Lisa (Diane Kruger). Furthermore, the state of Luke's relationship with his girlfriend and budding actress Alex (Rose Byrne) leaves a lot to be desired. The complexity of the interrelationships betwen the characters is gradually revealed, and while the surprise at the center of the story is not as great as that in the SIXTH SENSE, many of the same cinematic techniques of time shifting, misdirection, and well disguised clues are employed. Since I do not want to include any spoilers, I will simply summarize the story by saying that the tension builds gradually as the degree of the manipulation resulting from the romantic obsession of one of the characters is gradually revealed.

This is not a film for moviegoers who like linear plot expositions and easily categorizable stories. The element which causes it to rise above the usual mundane two or three star film about a manipulative psycho acting out a romantic fantasy is the structure of the film. The story is told in very nonlinear fashion, with cuts to flashbacks of events two years ago becoming more frequent as the film proceeds. Flashbacks to events that have just transpired are also interspersed, but these are experienced from the point of view of other than the primary narrator Matt. On occasion the technique was disorienting until I became accustomed to it, because the viewer has to figure out when the action is occuring. But if you stay alert, it was a very efective way of illuminating the events involved and adding contex through the rapidly changing perspectives. I definitely would have to watch the film again in order to see how often such juxtapositions could actually be recognized by an alert moviegoer and how many were totally a function of utilizing closeups which obscured the totality of the action. In summary, this is a technically interesting and well acted film telling a moderately interesting. The tension is palpable, because the viewer is never sure until the end whether it is primarily a romance or a psyhological thriller. (I certainly won't tell!) In conclusion, this is a story of both shattered lives and restored dreams.

2171664,1,B00067BBMS,"I saw ""Wicker Park"" at a preview screening last night and throughout the entire film kept getting the feeling that a better film lay buried somewhere in the slick cinematography, the non-linear structure and the superficial script.  Though I haven't seen it, I suspect that the better film I was detecting is ""L'Appartement,"" the French original upon ""Wicker Park"" is based.

Very briefly, Matt (Josh Hartnett) is introduced to us as a successful young ad-man with a promising career and an attractive, doting fiancee.  On the eve of an important business trip to China, he overhears a voice he believes belongs to a woman (Diane Kruger) who mysteriously disappeared from his life two years before.  He is instantly compelled to find her again, disregarding both his job and his fiancee in the process.  His obsession grows as he follows clues that seem to lead him to a dead end, but nothing is as it appears.

On the surface, the main problem with Wicker Park seems to be that it can't decide whether to be a suspense film or a romance, and so fails to do either very well.  The real problem, however, is that at no point does the film ever explore what lies beneath its flashy surface.  The romance between the main leads is told in fractured flashback sequences that do nothing to establish geniune chemistry between the characters.  We are never given a sense of what makes the relationship so powerful for these people that it still haunts them two years later (the present-day setting of most of the story).  The consequence: the resolution of the romantic plot seems arbitrary, and not earned (and then there's the matter of using Coldplay's ""The Scientist"" for the film's last scene, a mismatched music cue if I ever heard one).

Similarly, director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Brandon Boyce give us precious little information about what drives the suspense plot other than a few longing looks from the character who engineers it.  Is this what passes for motivation these days?  Presumably, a restaurant scene toward the end of the film, where the plot threads finally all collide, is supposed to explain some of this.  Unfortunately, it's a poorly handled, poorly written scene, though its one virtue is that it doesn't devolve into the predictable full-blown psycho-killer hysteria I was dreadedly anticipating.  (And why do the characters only ever go to this one restaurant?  I've been to Chicago, I know there's more than one place to eat.)

There are a number of other problems with ""Wicker Park"" - an unresolved wisp of a subplot that provides an important story point and is then discarded; the clumsy, identical way each flashback is introduced, etc. - that suggests this is the work of filmmakers who are clearly out of their depth.  Greater skill at balancing the story conflicts might have yielded a more satisfying film, so inasmuch as ""Wicker Park"" is a bad movie, it's really more frustrating for being an intriguing idea that is very poorly executed.",1093996800,15,2980,4.89065606361829

The supporting cast was not much better. Then the plot mucked up the movie. The twists and turns were laughably asinine. It was obvious that the writer simply asked himself/herself: ""How can I keep folding the plot back on itself until everyone gives up on trying to keep things straight?"" I gave up on it once the two female leads were talking in an apartment and everything was shifted, once again, when it came to who was doing who, who knew who.

Secondly, there were more plot holes than a piece of swiss cheese. WHY was the female lead in a restaurant phone booth if  she has a cell phone? (Which she does, as evidenced by the last scene in the airport.) WHY on earth does she need the bad chick to deliver the goodbye note when she HAS A KEY TO HIS APARTMENT her own self? And why would the bad chick be mad at the guy who shows up late for their date when SHE IS IN A PLAY THAT SAME EVENING? SHE CAN'T GO ON A DATE THAT NIGHT ANYWAY. SHE'S IN A PLAY!

Josh Hartnett's acting was great! I feel he is very believable. The other actors also did a great job.
This movie on the other hand not so much. I understand why people did not care for it.
It is nothing like I thought it would be.
It is a fatal attraction/ obsession. You are watching memories and things that have happened, it is all over the place. I could barely follow the story line because I just did not care about the characters.
I am very sad because these actors did great in a crap movie. Could have been so much better.

All this within a massively overpopulated Big City where seeing the same face twice is a matter of extreme structuralism if it is possible at all.

There wasn't enough background given to the characters to gain much understanding of who they were and why they did the things they did.  Yes, that heightened the tension, but it was rather uncomfortable rather than intriguing.  It wasn't until the scene of the Shakespeare play that I began to think I knew what the story line resembled - A Midsummer Night's Dream - crisscrossed lovers.

The device of split screen was used too often, like a one trick pony.  The songs were distracting and didn't fit.  Josh Harnett was very good, given his limited character.  The actor who played his best friend seemed awfully dull.",1470787200,2,676,4.826086956521739

2173157,5,B00067BBMS,"For some reason Wicker Park reminds me of Brian De Palmas' ""Body Double"" in the way that the mystery unfolds. I believe it might be that these two movies pivot on a psychological problem of one of the main characters. Then there is the similar style which makes itself perceived in its appropriately disjointed narrative progression and in the especially poignant portrayals of the main stars. However, where ""Body Double""is a premeditated murder mystery ""Wicker Park"" is a story of betrayal of love. This betrayal is the films' center action. All of the clues are there as to why two people madly in love suddenly betray their love. Yet,the likelihood that the film goer unravels the mystery his or herself is unlikely.
That's as far as I will go except to say that it has a very pleasing denouement. Its a great movie; one that your interest in watching will never flag once the main narrative is engaged, which is engaged from the start.",1449014400,,940,4.737804878048781

I'm a little biased too because I'm from Chicago and love Wicker Park (even though the film is mostly shot in Canada). It does feature Chicago's best and most historic hotel, The Drake (also biased because I stayed there the weekend I got engaged BECAUSE of this movie). It's a twisted love story and you'll never see the end coming. Or maybe you will but deep down you'll hope you're wrong. Beautiful story of how love hurts and true love isn't always what it seems to be. Incredible cast, the leading ladies I think we're a little bit of ""unknowns"" until this movie which helped them launch their careers. This is an excellent mess with your mind kind of movie. Not a typical chick flick. If you're not into movies like The Notebook (like me) then check this one out!

2173222,4,B00067BBMS,"Released in 2004, Wicker Park is a drama/mystery/romance about a young Chicago advertising executive (Josh Hartnett) who falls in love at first sight with a woman (Diane Kruger), which leads to a growing relationship that abruptly ends.  Meanwhile his best friend (Matthew Lillard) starts dating a woman (Rose Byrne) who is more  or less  than what she appears. Jessica Par&eacute; and Christopher Cousins have small roles.

This is an extremely well-made movie with a hip, kinetic flair, but a convoluted, non-linear story that makes your head spin. While its not as effective as other non-linear movies, like 1994s Pulp Fiction, the last act ties everything together and is pretty impressive, but its almost tiresome till then, although things perk up when Rose Byrne appears early in the second act. Anyway, its just mind-boggling to think of all the details the filmmakers had to keep track of to put the story together and make it make sense in the end. The movie explores the love at first sight phenomenon and the crazy things love or obsession make people do.

The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in Chicago, Montreal and New York City.

I have a waxing?)! Then the split screens make you harder to see (who would want to not see more of me?), and Ow, the damn oddly dusty-complected insecure (human, all too human) woman and just-not-square-male-enough (humans are so tiresome!) male supporting undergarment actor WILL take up way more screen time than, by the implicitly Nazi unconscious ideology of ""Foreground the Good-Looking! Only the Very Good-Looking!,"" they ought in any reasonable world to have. It is so unfair! I mean, the less good-looking you are, the more evil, unstable, and boring you are. Obviously. Everybody knows that. Finally the super good-looking people win and are reunited. Of. Course. But it takes way too long.

2173235,5,B00067BBMS,This is one of my favorite romance movies in the world. The plot is so twisted and the whole story line will keep you focused on the movie until it's done. At first I thought it's just a typical romance story but I ended up impressed on how it all turned out. It's very unpredictable. It's like David Fincher made it. It's so damn good and Josh Hartnett and Dianne Kruger did a very good job portraying their roles. The soundtrack is also amazing.

2173252,3,B00067BBMS,"The character Alex states, Love makes you do crazy things, insane things and that statement in a way summarizes this tale of love and obsession. Set in a cold, snowy Chicago winter, Wicker Park is about the lying and deception at the heart of obsessive relationships. Its about the lengths the characters will go to in order to pursue love at first sight. This film is hard to follow at times; the viewer has to wait patiently for explanations, and whether the payoff is worth it is debatable. I enjoyed the film for the most part, though its not without flaws.

Josh Hartnetts character is completely smitten, obsessed with Diane Krugers character, which I understand-Ive loved her since the first time I saw her. Hartnett is competent at playing awkwardly shy yet tenacious, but I would have liked to have seen an actor more capable of emotional depth. Matthew Lillard, too is miscast. He plays Hartnetts goofy friend, and hes a better actor than Hartnett but he wasn't right for this. Rose Byrnes Alex is the most interesting character, and shes the most convincing actor. Appropriately she wears a mask during her Shakespeare performance within this film, just as she figuratively wears a mask-perfect symbolism.

The movie culminates in an insane coincidence-fest at a restaurant, and the ending is corny as well. It is Hitchcockian, this series of coincidences about desperation and obsession.  To borrow a line from one of the characters, its both creepy and hot. Although Im not a sucker for love stories, I couldn't turn it off, so I give Wicker Park a qualified recommendation",1415664000,,1586,4.91044776119403

This is a very well acted film, Rose Byrne is a clear standout, and the cast was an overall successful ensemble. This is one of those films with a lot of twists and turns, coupled with switching the past and present - sounds a bit dizzying, but it all makes sense. The locations, colors, clothing, weather, etc. they all work as well, giving the film an artistic look. Give it a shot, if you enjoyed it, watch it one more time.

Diane Kruger and Josh Hartnett acted very well as well as Rose Byrne. Jessica Pare didn't have much scope in the film and that's what I didn't like. The story is based on how a crafty friend spoils the relationship between the two lovers. I wasn't convinced that tiny bits of lies spread by other people can make lovers hate each other. The  camera picks up some nice spots in Chicago, my beloved city. 'The Drake Hotel' reminded my stay there. The wind of the windy city, the familiar skyscrapers, the snow and fogging breaths of the people. All shown very nicely.
The music score is good.
But the story and the flashbacks confused me. It became too stressful to find a meaning in the story,made me yawn several times. I saw it only because IMDB rating was 6.9. I can't agree with that rating. I'd probably give only 4.0

I just watched this movie again last night and fell in love with it all over again. This story has everything, an amazing love story, the insight to realizing we only see what we want to in life and have no clue about what else might be going on. It's inspiring because it shows how one shouldn't give up one what he/she wants. I can't help but think how much this has happened in real life, people manipulating others for their own gain, especially back in the day before telephone. It made it a little annoying that they didn't just get cellphones but I guess then we wouldn't have had the story. I love that it is mysterious while still having some funny parts here and there.

I just finished watching Wicker Park for the second time around, I never really remembered any part of it, and I honestly thought I haven't watched it before, but once i started it, i knew i've seen it before, i just never remembered the details or the story at all, which was to my delight, as i enjoyed it so much.
the movie displays human emotions to perfection, as it is a tale that involves Love, Jelousy and Deceit. the actors, brought the characters to life and displayed their emotions in such a great way. the movie captured my attention from start to finish, i was glued to the screen, so intrigued !
Josh Hartnet was pretty good, but the star here, was Rose Byrne, whom im becoming a huge fan of, she was brilliant with her character. I also liked her a lot in every other role she played, particularly in the excellent TV drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damages-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000YW8RPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damages: The Complete First Season</a>

2173327,4,B00067BBMS,"I thought this was a beautiful movie with interesting flashback scenes and a very satisfying conclusion.  Some reviewers complained about it being hard to follow - true, it was a little tricky, but you eventually get the idea.  I don't care that there wasn't time to explore the ""characterization of their romance"", like one reviewer wrote, or a thin subplot.  The main theme behind the movie was well done and I felt very moved and satisfied at the end - two good conclusions for me.  The only thing I didn't like was how they made it hard for the characters to stay in touch - everyone has call waiting on their cell phones and also email accounts.  That didn't much matter to me... I enjoyed it enough that I'll watch it again in the next few days.",1315180800,,751,4.452554744525547
2173328,4,B00067BBMS,"I think the acting was good, plot interesting.  Only thing that could have been better is that from the time that Matthew loses Lisa to the time he finds clues to where she is is 2 years: but the movie did not really drive that home.  Also--too many flash backs.",1289952000,,262,4.22
2173329,5,B00067BBMS,"I'm not someone who watches movies repeatedly, at least not very often.  For example, I've only seen my all-time favorite, ""Donnie Darko"", only twice.  However, over the six years since ""Wicker Park"" came out, I've watched it three times, and I've loved it every time.
Unlike some, I didn't find it at all confusing.  If anything, watching the storyline unravel the very first time made that viewing the best of the three.  And this is nowhere near as complex a storyline as ""Memento"", ""Irreversible"" (and one of the stars of that, Monica Bellucci, was in the original French version of this movie), or ""Donnie Darko"" for that matter (or heck, even ""Pulp Fiction"").
I'm not going to go into the plot.  As Roger Ebert has pointed out, it's nearly impossible to do so without giving something away--and if you haven't watched it yet, I want you to be able to enjoy it as I did the first time.
What I do want to say is that Rose Byrne's performance in this film is fantastic.  The look of pain on her face when someone reveals something to her through a dressing room door is so real that I actually felt it, as if I'd been punched in the stomach.  And despite the foreknowledge during later viewing, that visceral reaction to her acting occurred the second and third time I watched the movie as well.  During a much later scene in the film, in a restaurant, you can actually see the sickened (as in heartsick) look she gets as she realizes that she's not going to get what she most desires in the world.  Simply an amazing performance throughout the film, and I honestly can't remember ever being as affected by the performance of any actor or actress in anything else (with the possible exception of Anna Chlumsky's performance at the funeral in ""My Girl"", but that was just one scene, not throughout the entire movie).",1287792000,4,1818,4.58641975308642
2173330,1,B00067BBMS,"damn movie didn't work. But I'm too lazy to send it back.. Lost out on like 6 bucks so eh. But yea, wldnt even play.",1287014400,,116,3.68
2173331,4,B00067BBMS,"""Wicker Park"" doesn't have a totally original plot. In fact, you could easily compare it to ""Single White Female."" What is original, however, is how it's done.

Main character Matthew's girlfriend disappears one day without a word, a phone call, a note, etc. She's just gone. And the only other option he has is to move on with his life, still haunted by the fact that the woman he was madly in love with just vanished.
The movie begins about two years later from that event, and he has a fiance, a great job, and everything's going perfect for him. Until he gets a little glimpse of a girl that he believes to be Lisa, the girlfriend who disappeared.

Now, this review is going to include only slight spoilers, but nothing that will be bad enough to ruin any aspect of the movie for you.

From this little moment, Matthew drops everything to search for Lisa. He lies to his fiance, he cancels a business trip, and he begins a mad hunt to find her, which actually makes him seem more desperate and stalker-like than starstruck. To the point that he uses an apartment key she accidentally left behind to break into her apartment and then fall asleep on her bed.
I would not call him romantic. I would call him a creeper.

In any case, he eventually discovers that the girl he's been trailing is actually the wrong Lisa. Or ""Lisa."" And so begins the ""Single White Female"" aspect as she develops an obsession for him while he still obsesses over the real Lisa.

Anyways, moving away from the plot itself, it's a good movie. Not the best, but still pretty good. It's the kind of movie that will make your head spin from all of the details and the way that every little piece of the movie connects. It's not a movie you can pick up at in the middle, and go from there. You need to see it beginning to end.

Now, I can't call it a suspense movie, because there really aren't any times where you can put the pieces together yourself. The movie doesn't give you enough clues. You're forced to sit there and think ""what the heck's going on with this plot?"" for almost the entire time. So, if you're looking for the kind of suspense that keeps you thinking, you won't find it here. However, the story is still thrilling to watch as it unravels and shows what's really going on.

The story itself is a little bit unrealistic, but overall, it's pretty well done. The acting and actors are good. The story's decent. And the ending is, well, satisfying. Oh, and the music is pretty good too. Despite it being an almost two hour movie, it doesn't feel that long and it doesn't feel too drawn out. The pace is perfectly set.

Many reviews mention that the flash backs are a little hard to follow apart from the main story. I will admit that maybe the first one or two throw you for a loop, as there's really no introduction that implies it's from the past. But after that, if you're paying attention, it's easy to pick out what's present and what's a flashback.

Overall, Wicker Park is a movie I really enjoyed. It's a slightly different twist on the ""stalker"" story, and is just a good movie to watch. However, I have to take off a star simply for the stupidity and stalker-like desperation of the main character; he's just that bad about it.",1285372800,,3228,4.430016863406408

It's a brilliant motion picture by every measure; all elements work together. I not only enjoy the film, I study it, learn from it

So I bought Guigan's THE RECKONING; to me, a mess. (Nice design though.) Its script and editing shrank its stars to a charitable two. I took another shot with WICKER PARK, a chaotic scramble of random frustrating ambiguity that perhaps was meant to confuse, stir up audiences and then resolve the chaos to redeem the viewers' confusion, invested time and money. Sadly, not so. It mostly antagonizes and confabulates.

The story goes that SLEVIN's stars. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsly, Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett signed on because of its great script.

I most-often tried films based on their director. No more. Sure, Ridley Scott or his peers get my attention. But script/concept/ actors together really signal a film's quality.

I'm going to count Amazon star ratings and read reviews more carefully, too. Like the other reviews here; overall, they pegged this turkey. Of course read what they say, but read between their lines, too. And catch how they base/focus their judgments.",1280620800,,1406,5.84390243902439

2173345,3,B00067BBMS,"Now, Lets be honest folks. You're in what we used to call a record store, looking for a film with some mystery, some action, some suspense; you know few of the current group of stars and up-and-comers, few of the current (last 20 years) crop of movies, and you come on a DVD whose blurb on the front cover reads, ""dangerous, sexy thriller"" , whose back cover includes the words, "" a sizzling, action-packed noir thriller that will leave you breathless"" . Isn't it reasonable to expect at least a little bit of ""dangerous"", just a particle of ""thriller"", perhaps not a ""sizzle"" but certainly a sputter or two, maybe not packed with action but with at least some movement, and as for ""noir"", at least a bit of grey or  a smidgen of charcoal. Did we get any of this, not on your life. At the end of the first hour of excruciating absence of even a whimper never mind thrills, I began to figure we were in for a very, very slowly developing Hitchcockian ordinary people find themselves in extraordinary circumstances type of film; by the end of the film, I was still waiting.
Forewarned, you might enjoy this mirthless romantic travesty. Don't get me wrong, There is almost no evidence the creators sought for comedy. I just want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps a mild ha (not ha! ha! ) would be elicited from some easily pleased viewers but, on the whole none of the players seemed to be directed to show some flair; no, I take this back, there were a few minutes at the very beginning in the dance studio where a rehearsal was briefly shown-that had a soupcon of sizzle, no more, but more than anything else in the film.

2173346,2,B00067BBMS,"If better actors than Josh Hartnett or Diane Krueger had been cast, WICKER PARK could have been a sleek thriller with lead characters we cared out.  Instead, it's a glossy but fairly lifeless mystery that generates only academic interest.

Hartnett plays a young professional who seems to have it made.  He's about to be engaged to a lovely young professional.  He's helped land a major client, is about to globetrot to China in preparation for taking another leap upward in his career.  Yet just as all these pieces are falling into place, he thinks he spies the woman (Diane Krueger) he had a passionate affair with 2 years ago...an affair that ended abruptly with her disappearance.  He literally watched her walk away from him after a conversation in a restaurant and never saw her again.

He thinks he's moved on, but in truth, he is compelled to track down this woman who MIGHT be the woman he once loved (and clearly still does).  His quest to track down this woman is interspersed with flashbacks of their relationship, from uncomfortable first meeting to hot, fiery passion to what sure seemed like love to Hartnett, at least.  He follows the trail, and it doesn't quite lead him where he would have hoped.

He is assisted by his old friend, woman's shoe store owner Matthew Lillard.  And he is drawn to another woman (Rose Byrne) who seems to somehow figure into all this.

The movie is a puzzle to be fitted together.  And the puzzle is mildly, but only academically intriguing.  In order to really care about this piece, we have to really care about the hot, steamy romance between our two leads.  We need to FEEL a desire to see what happened to these people we care about, and we would then feel properly shocked, surprised, dismayed, joyful, etc. at all the events that unfold as Hartnett moves closer to the truth.

The basic plot of WICKER PARK is not too bad, but the script is not the best.  It makes the mistake of assuming (as so many movies do) that if we see two attractive people making transcendent love in their chic apartments...we'll fall in love with them ourselves and dote on their every move.  It takes a bit of sparkling dialogue or real chemistry between stars to do that.  The script misses on the dialogue, and the two stars BADLY, REALLY BADLY miss on the chemistry part.  Krueger hasn't really done too much on-screen work in the past, and with her accent, can perhaps be somewhat forgiven for coming across as a pretty airhead.  Hartnett, however, is a more complex problem.  For me, I am hard-pressed to think of a ""star"" in recent years who is less capable of acting.  I guess ""the chicks dig him"" or something, because he kept landing big parts in PEARL HARBOR, 40 DAYS AND NIGHTS, LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN, HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE and this clunker.  And in not one of those films was he even remotely convincing.  In WICKER PARK, he's asked to smolder and look sad.  His smolder makes him just look vaguely dim-witted and his sad makes him look like a 6 year old crying over a spanking from Mommy.  He's truly, thoroughly dreadful, and utterly lacking in charisma.  There are a number of ""stars"" who can't act very well (Dwayne Johnson springs immediately to mind)  but they have charisma to burn.  Hartnett is in the same category as Hayden Christiansen and Jessica Alba...singularly  unable to be a human being an audience can care about.

Matthew Lillard is not a great actor either, but he at least musters ups energy and is mildly sympathetic.  Rose Byrne is a dour creature...but at least something seems to be going on behind her eyes.  I like her better in stuff like ""Damages"" where her slow burn has time to work.  I wouldn't say she  ""succeeds"" in WICKER PARK, but it is only as her character develops that any real interest in the film kicks in.

In the end, WICKER PARK aspires to be a mystery romance or perhaps a love-story / thriller.  It neither thrills nor inspires romantic feelings.  However, it does add another page to the ""why Josh Hartnett"" mystery.

I would avoid this PG-13 movie at almost all costs.",1245974400,2,4059,4.630252100840337

2173349,3,B00067BBMS,"...lousy acting, bad casting, and incoherent story.

The two main leads, Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger, are very telegenic but mediocre actors, with a very limited range which the script only highlights.  Hartnett spends 90% of the film looking handsomely befuddled, while Kruger is the epitome of the deer-in-the-headlights.

Kruger is a fairly attractive young woman, but in the looks department she is overshadowed by both Rose Byrne who plays the film's villain, and Jessica Pare, the girl who Hartnett becomes engaged to.  I.e. she is far too bland to really fit the role of Stunning Goddess The Hero Cannot Live Without, especially given the competition.  I simply couldn't understand how our hero would've possibly chosen her over the other two women on his plate.  Byrne is especially fetching, combining both irresistible vulnerability and intense sensuality.

The plot is hopelessly convoluted and improbable, strung together by one coincidence and near-miss-cliffhanger after another.  Torturous, in a word.  The ending had me laughing out loud, it was so ridiculous...mercifully diluted by the Coldplay tune that comes on during the last 2 minutes.

Yet what kept me watching was the visual beauty of this film...the sets, cinematography, and yes, the amateurish but quite attractive women.",1238025600,2,1303,5.405940594059406
2173350,5,B00067BBMS,"Mathew falls in love with Lisa, whom he sees for the first time while passing next to the shop he works at. They meet up and both deeply fall in love, then she disappears without leaving trace.

He starts a new life after failing to find Lisa, dates another girl for 2 years, whom is supposed to later get married to him, but however he is still haunted by the memories of Lisa and the question of why she left him.

Then one day at a restaurant he spots Lisa very quickly before she leaves. He traces her through the hotel key room she leaves at the restaurant, and starts afterwards throughout the movie following many traces of her until he eventually leads himself to another Lisa, however not the same blonde Lisa he was in love with!

In the end we realize that this new Lisa (brunette) faked her identity. Her actually name was Alex. She was deeply in love with Mathew for a long time without him knowing. She fell in love with him at first sight the same way he fell in love with Lisa!

In fact, she was Lisa's close friend, but when she discovered her relationship with Mathew, she did all she can to keep them apart, and she succeeded to keep them so for 2 years. Evetually Mathew discovers her lie and finds the Lisa he loves and gets back together with her.

Quite mysterious movie and not very easy to follow at first, however excellent story that keeps you thinking while watching the film.

This movie for me was mainly about jealousy. How jealousy could hurt others. Alex was jealous because her friend Lisa was deeply in love with Mathew, so she decided to ruin their love. Didn't we see many cases like this in our lives?

Also, cheating was a major thing in this movie. Mathew cheats on his fiancee with Lisa (emotionally). He also cheats on Lisa with Alex (physically). Alex cheats on her boy friend with Mathew. The only faithful one was Lisa. However, cheating wasn't stressed much on in this movie even though it was a major act.

Love at first sight was also very much stressed on. I do not know if it actually exists, but many people seem to believe it does.

2173351,4,B00067BBMS,"While some aspects of this plot are fairly far-fetched, it is nevertheless a sexy mystery story.  It centers around the concept of obsession, but not in the way it first appears.  The film has a nice dreamlike quality to it & the subtle soundtrack helps push the story forward.  As it is full of flashbacks by 3 of the characters, it kind of resembles the undoing of an omelet.

It is fitting that one of the characters is an actress in a Shakesperian play;  many of Shakespeare's storylines featured motifs of mistaken identity.  So too is the case in this film.  Still, mistaken identity or not, this movie proves that only Josh Hartnett could get away with turning a breaking-and-entering into a sleepover!

The acting is of a high caliber;  both Rose Byrne & Diane Kruger are capable actresses (not to mention easy on the eyes!).  Hartnett has once again expanded his range, having acted in everything from a war movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hawk-Down/dp/B000065U1N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hawk Down</a>) to a fun & silly Romantic Comedy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/40-Days-and-40-Nights/dp/B00006ADFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">40 Days and 40 Nights</a>).  He has done a good job of preventing his career from being typecast.

This is a good film that explores how being someone's secret admirer can cross the line into the territory of being a stalker very easily. It is and edgy film, but would have been better with an ""R"" rating.  For myself, it also did a good job of demonstrating the crazy stuff that women do that drives men like me nuts!!",1226016000,,1658,5.4296875
2173352,4,B00067BBMS,"I'll try not to make this sound like a love letter to Rose Byrne, but I apologize in advance if it comes across as such.  I hope people will agree with me when I say that her performance alone makes this movie a must see.

Rose is not the only reason this movie is great.  It is a heart-wrenching, tragic love story/mystery brought to life with stunning visual style.  Wicker Park is a moving painting augmented by a poetic story.  It is a tale of a man, Matthew (played by Josh Hartnett) desperately searching for a lost love, Lisa (Diane Kruger). The film is told in a non-linear fashion and key plot points are revealed at precisely the right time to keep the viewer guessing.  This is kind of a spoiler; but the reason his love is lost is because of the manipulative scheming of Alex (Rose Byrne's character).  She falls hopelessly in love with Matthew from afar before he even knows who she is.  Without too much trouble she is able to devise a plan which allows her to break up the lovers and at the same time get close to Matthew.  That's the details of this particular film, but what it boils down to is a classic theme: person A loves person B while person C loves person A.  Unfortunately person A essentially doesn't know that person C exists.  It's a basic story that almost everyone can relate to in some form or another.

Okay back to the main subject of my review.  Yes, Josh Hartnett is well cast and Diane Kruger is adequate in her role, but the real star of the show is Rose Byrne.  Her character is not fully revealed until 45 minutes into the film, but from that moment on, you will forever be under her spell.  Rose is perfectly cast.  No one can say as much with just their eyes and facial expressions as Rose Byrne can.  Love, hurt, anger, fear, sadness, remorse, embarrassment, and elation are all easily displayed without so much as a word.  And what a beautiful face it is, her eyes alone make me weak.  Thankfully the filmmakers were aware of this and took full advantage; frequently shooting her in close-up.

Rose's character Alex can easily be seen as the villain because she does everything in her power to keep Matthew and Lisa apart.  Just like in real life, however, everything isn't black and white.  ""Love makes you do crazy things,"" as Rose's character declares.  It depends on who you personally identify with.  Different viewers will sympathize with different characters, and that is a credit to the dramatic story and to the filmmakers.

As mentioned earlier, Wicker Park is beautifully photographed and edited (split screen is used frequently to great effect) and the music/score enhances every scene perfectly. Ideally I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could (I reserve the five stars for a select few) and I can't think of many better ways to spend two hours.",1217116800,6,2807,4.554890219560878
2173353,3,B00067BBMS,"Paul McGuigan's ""Wicker Park"" is like a demented episode of friends without the self-conscious humor.  Matthew is a twentysomething executive type engaged to his boss's sister but seriously pining for his old lover, Lisa, who left without a trace two years earlier.  When Matthew and his fiancee return to Chicago (following Matthew's two year self-exile in New York), Matt hooks up with Luke, an old buddy who was privy to the whole Lisa drama. Luke has recently begun dating Alex, an elusive actress who is driving him crazy.  Soon after his return, Matthew spies the long-missing Lisa in a restaurant where he is having a drink with his fiancee and her brother.  Or does he?  Things start to get really complicated from there on out, so it's important to pay attention in order to keep all the threads straight, as the lives of all the characters intersect in unexpected ways.  It's advertised as a thriller but there's nothing really thrilling about ""Wicker Park""; despite it twists and turns, it is, first and foremost, a soap opera, and one that, despite its subject matter, is oddly un-sexy.

Director McGuigan does a fair job translating a French film into an American remake.  It has a flashy, jumpy quality that keeps the viewer on edge, although that doesn't always work in the film's favor.  Josh Hartnett delivers a fine performance as Matthew, the film's hero; he reminds me a lot of Timothy Hutton back in his heyday.  This is, arguably, one of his best performances.  As the long-lost lover, Diane Kruger is attractive but there seems to be something missing from her Lisa; she's not all that interesting and it's hard to believe that she cares much for Matthew.  Much better is Rose Byrne as the secretive Alex; is it a coincidence that she shares the same name as the femme fatale in ""Fatal Attraction""?  As played by Byrne, Alex is hot and cold, a dynamic mystery woman playing a dangerous game.  Matthew Lillard, as Luke, is believable but I have never seen much variation in any of his performances; maybe that has more to do with the kind of roles he keeps getting.

Both movies actually begin near the end of the plot, relying on extensive flashbacks. They are really a jumble of out-of-order scenes that are presumably tied up in the end in a sensible way. In WICKER PARK, I didn't find it tied up very neatly, albeit, the conclusion was understandable enuf. (I saw L'APPARTEMENT later and I can't say that it would have been different for me if I saw that first even tho it has a VERY different ending.)

Upon re-watching the film with and eye to figuring out the timeline, I began to see how much better the film would have been in a conventional form. This had the potential to be a  satisfying movie.

As for the cast, top marks go to the very lovely young Aussi, Rose Byrnes, so convincing and heart-rending as the mousey girl, and Matthew Lillard as a lively friend. Sleepy-sounding Josh Hartnett makes a solid leading man. German actress Diane Kruger and, in a small role, the Canadian Jessica Par are very pretty.

I almost turned it off when he kept doing things that made me cringe at how pathetic he looked. But after the first flashback you start to get a feel for the movie.

Yes, this director seemed to love to tell a disjointed story using a series of flashbacks. And a technique of showing the characters through a reflective view, as if watching them through a mirror at times. You can actually really appreciate this film on the second viewing.

You realize that the main character fell madly in love with Lisa played by Diane Kruger. But one day she just disappears and two years later Matthew thinks he sees her again.  Of course he tracks her down to only find another Lisa, who we find out is Alex played by Rose Byrne. But we can tell something sinister is happening.

 Josh Hartnett plays Matthew who is on his way to Shanghai for business, when he spots who he thinks is the girl that left him high and dry two years before, Lisa, played by Diane Kruger (was Helen in 'Troy'). So lying to his new girlfriend he instead tries to track down Lisa. Following a trail of what, to him, could lead only to Lisa. He does a few things that make you question his sanity. When he finally reaches the end of the trail the girl he does find, Lisa/Alex, played by Rose Byrne. Obviously not his Lisa. But there is something sinister lurking behind the story of this girl and there are far too many coincidences connecting the two women.

 Hartnett is wonderfully tortured, lost, confused, but at the same time so determined to find the love of his life. His film roles are steadily getting better and better.

 Byrne demands sympathy from the viewer, bringing a whole new meaning to ""I saw him first."" Matthew Lillard is great as Hartnett's best friend, Luke, who is trying to support him but at the same time, knock some sense into him.

 This was a great film. By the end of it I wanted Hartnett to find his closure so bad that I found myself yelling "" NO"" every time a new obstacle was thrown in his way.

2173378,3,B00067BBMS,"This film was deceiving.  As many have mentioned it promised something totally opposite to what it provided.  This film isn't the least bit thrilling or mysterious.  You pretty much understand what's going on right away and just have to sit back and wait for the rest of the world to figure it out.  Josh Hartnett does pull this off though, and even if you don't think he'd make a great investment banker you can't deny he has acting skills.  He has a lot of warmth in just his eyes alone and is able to convey feelings without opening his mouth.  I feel one day he'll really break out (`Oscar attention' break out) if given the perfect role.

Hartnett plays Matthew, a man who is still devastated by the one that got away.  That 'one' was Lisa (Diane Kruger in a surprisingly strong...compared to her `Troy' fiasco...performance), a young dancer who captured Matthews heart only to disappear without a word and leave Matthew lost and depressed.  Time has passed, and although Matthew has moved on (he's now engaged) he hasn't forgotten Lisa, and when she mysteriously appears he becomes frantic to find her and reunite.  Rose Byrne and Matthew Lillard co-star as Alex, the mysterious girl who may or may not have had something to do with Lisa's disappearance, and Luke, Matthews's best friend.  The stand out here is Byrne who plays psycho pretty convincingly.

My only regret is the studios decision to market this as a thriller a'la 'Fatal Attraction' but they failed to deliver, and the false pretence that anything here would be remotely steamy is also a let down.  Even with a PG-13 in tact they could have upt the ante with some passion and intensity.

Did no-one else see L'Appartement the original film. Appart from the clever camera work and effects and very subtle changes to the storyline they are identical. In fact Wicker park is a faded Photocopy of the original. the original is far far better, intiguing and beguiling.

Have a look at the original and see how this story was intended to be told. just about every aspect of the original has been attempted to be duplicated but sadly it doesn't compare to the original french film. Sadly this is another remake of a great world cinema classic, and as usual it's a poor copy at best.

In fact, I didn't expect much from the movie and thought that I wouldn't like it.  The movie sat on my shelf for three weeks before I finally stuck it into the DVD player out of pure

boredom.  I won't go into the plot of the movie.  You can get that from many of the other reviews.  WhatI will say is that I found myself hooked about halfway through the film when I began to realize that this was a love story and not a thriller.  Though I'm not a big Josh Harnett fan, he won me over and had me rooting for him during the last third of the movie.  The ending (to my surprise) brought tears to my eyes.  That seldom happens when I watch a movie, unless you count The Notebook, A Message In A Bottle, The Bridges of Madison County, Made In Heaven, and Somewhere In Time.  This is definitely a movie that I want to watch again, which is saying a lot because I see so many movies that do absolutely nothing for me emotionally.  Wicker Park was a most pleasant surprise that tugged at my heart and had me wondering why I couldn't find someone to love as strongly as the character seem to do in this film.  That's the reason I'm giving it 5 Stars.

Story was a bit confusing to start off with, but picked up pieces later.

The only reason I gave this movie 7/10 was because of the song that plays during the airport scene in the end.

""The Scientist"" - sounded more like a piano ballad from the good old 70s. Given my folk and old music taste, I don't care much for new bands. But Coldplay did a marvellous job in this song.

This is a film about love found, love lost and love found again two years later. The film takes place in the present but we are treated to flashabacks of past events in the characters lives that answer many questions and also scenes that have already happened are shown again but from a different character's perspective. If you pay close attention to some of the scenes you can catch details that are made more clear later in the film. While not one of my favorite actors, I thought Josh Hartnett did a great job in this film and was able to show all of the pain and confusion his character was going through with just his facial expressions. I do realize that the film isn't perfect and has it faults. In fact my main problem with this film is Matthew Lillard as Hartnett's friend.

Wicker Park was in theaters for all of 2 weeks and the preview just wasn't strong enough for me to care that much (seemed too nutty).

It's an easy on the eyes movie, with ok acting and stylish editing.  Josh Hartnett isn't exactly riveting, but the women are good, and Matthew Lillard is presented in small enough doses so that he's fun to watch, as opposed to annoying.

2173433,4,B00067BBMS,"I picked up Wicker Park at random at my local Blockbuster.  After watching the first 20 minutes I found myself bored: ok, Matthew is a young up-and-coming businessman who, on the eve of a business trip overseas, runs into a woman who he thinks is his long-lost love Lisa.  So he cancels his trip and starts hunting for her.  Where is this going?

But in the end, I'm so glad I braved on.  The plot thickens and the appearance of a brunette Lisa starts to make things interesting.  Even though Harnett's acting leaves much to be desired, Australian actress Byrne simply gets better and better as the film progresses.  The film does involved quite a number of flashbacks, but, contrary to the Amazon official reviewer's complaint, they are very easy to follow.  The director uses flashes (literally) to let the audience know they are watching a flashback.  Even without these cues, the ""time travel"" is not confusing at all -- and I'm someone who usually loathes flashbacks (or flash-forwards).

I have not watched the 1996 French flick of which Wicker Park is a remake (man, can't Hollywood churn out any good originals no more?), so I'm not going to make a comparison of the two.  But Wicker Park stands well on its own.  After Alex's appearance, the plot has enough suspense to make the remainder 90 minutes quite enjoyable.  Ultimately, it's a love story: unwavering love and desperate love, never-ending love and secret love.  If you ever felt a long-lasting crush on someone, this is a great film for you.  Even if you never did, this is still a film worthy of two hours.

2173434,3,B00067BBMS,"[CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS]  One strange thing is that when I saw the trailer of 'Wicker Park,' I thought this film must be a Hitchcock-like thriller.  Now I saw it, and found it isn't.  It is more like a romance shot with a Brian DePalma touch -- romantic, moody, and very convoluted.  Most likely you don't believe the story, OK, but you are constantly entertained.  Turn a blind eye to unbelievable coincidences and silly decisions that the characters make.

This is another (some say, ruined) remake of French film 'L'Appartment' (1996) starring Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel.  The MGM/Lakeshore Entertainment remake, directed by Paul McGuigan ('Gangster No,1'), stars instead Josh Hartnett as Matthew, a successful businessman who is engaged to beautiful Rebecca (Jessica Pare), and is about to travel to China on business.  But at the restroom of a restaurant, he overhears a familiar voice of someone he knew very well, in fact, someone he loved two years ago.

She is Lisa (Diane Kruger, 'Troy'), and instead of going to the airport, Matthew tracks down his ex-love to one hotel room.  Then, the flashback sections bring us the romantic events between Lisa and Matthew, seen from his point of view -- how he met her in the snowy city of Chicago, how he talked to her at a shop where Matthew's buddy (Matthew Lillard) works, and how Matthew loved her so passionately.

But suddenly Lisa disappeared, abruptly, leaving any trace behind.  And more incredible thing is (to him, and to us all), as Matthew (of the present tense) follows the clues of Lisa's whereabouts, he finds himself in Lisa's room (don't ask me how he get in), finds another girl (Rose Byrne, also 'Troy' as Briseis) who claims she is Lisa.

OK, let's stop it, for there are more to come, more to surprise us.  The film is basically a love story seen from more than one perspectives, but director McGuigan uses too many flashbacks explaining the 'truths' which not only mystify our mind, but grab our head, and keep on twisting them.  I eventually understood, and never lost interest in, what really happened to the characters, but still do not know what is the film's point after all, with these jumbled time order and even split screens.  Did we really need these styles to tell this story, especially when this is not a thriller?

I was not a little impressed with the acting of the four main cast.  While Josh Hartnett is the weakest link, that is probably his character acts in a very impossible way.  Kruger is much better than in 'Troy' but it is Rose Byrne who is really memorable, pulling off this very demanding role.  And it is time we should give Matthew Lillard a chance to do something different.  He is not bad; it is that he deserves better than playing just another wiseacre buddy who turns out not as wise as the main character.

Certainly 'Wicker Park' keeps you guessing, as long as you just stop thinking.  Don't think about why all these characters do not use e-mail when they use cell phones ten times a day.  Don't think about why three (or more, I am afraid) characters leave messages on paper, surely troublesome and unreliable way.

But Chicago holds memories, and by being there he's reminded of a  nagging longing for an ex- he dated two years before.  And then, coincidence be damned, he thinks he catches a glimpse of her - Lisa -- as she's leaving.  Could it be?  Lisa?

Now, Shakespeare used coincidence, and Thomas Hardy was not above using the lost-letter-at-a-critical-moment device, but ""Wicker Park"" is a virtual litany of missed phone calls, meetings, misunderstandings, and one pathetic Iago of a villainess (Rose Byrne as Alex).  But Byrne can act, and against all odds, she actually lifts this ultimately treacly mess.  (Matthew Lillard as Matt's friend Daniel, is also good.) And Byrne certainly acts circles around the bad Josh Hartnett, who somehow succeeds in maintaining a romantic frown for the entire move.  I guess that counts for something - great face muscles?  But the result is that he looks perpetually like a bruised Bambi. But back to Alex, who, like Iago with a wounded heart, deliberately misleads the lovers, because she has her own flame burning for Matt.  Good acting aside, she is however left with the unfortunate line, ""Love makes you do crazy things"", which is right up there with ""Love Story's"" ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""  (Well, in fairness, it's probably a wiser statement.)  The love interest in all this, Lisa (""Troy's"" Diane Kruger), really didn't register with me at all - probably because her character never gets any traction due to the excessive use of flashbacks.  Still, much has been said about how Kruger shows more of a pulse in ""Wicker Park,"" than she did in ""Troy.""  I disagree, if for no other reason than that ""Troy's"" a better movie.  In ""Troy"" you have guys with swords and stuff, which is certainly more ""thrilling"" than ""Wicker Park.""  And Kruger's got the face that launched a thousand ships. I saw them. And a better wardrobe!",1107820800,,2244,4.83989501312336
2173450,4,B00067BBMS,"This is what happens when emo kids grow up to be filmmakers.... well, french film RE-makers to be more exact...

This kaleidoscopic montage of creepy people doing creepy things and basically calling the proverbial kettle black trips and skips over itself and generally comes across as a pretentious experiment in transitional fades and blurry color techniques. It just may be a 115 minute indie rock music video. But by george if I didn't like it. The previews would have you believe it is a thriller, but its really more of a glorified chick flick. And still, I liked it. The soundtrack really helped this film along with cuts by The Postal Service, The Shins, and Death Cab For Cutie (to name a few) providing the haunting emotions behind every scene.

Though I've seen Josh Hartnett better, (he was amazing in ""O"") he wasn't too bad. Rose Byrne, who plays Lisa 2, was fantastic as the lovesick ""psycho"". I really look forward to seeing more of her. It was also nice to see Jessica Pare, who plays Rebecca, in another film. (She and her castmates from Lost & Delirious seem to be doing very well.) The big surprise for me was Matthew Lillard who plays Hartnett's best friend. I hate Matthew Lillard. But his work in this movie completely won me over. He's great. (Be sure to watch the deleted scenes.)

Though a lot of the story turns were obvious, it definitely kept me engaged and tore at my heart. Though the editing was a little flashy, I really enjoyed the direction they took. Merging scenes, mixing up time, camera angles, and using reflections and glass to break up the scenes added to the message of ""nothing is at it seems"". The whole movie is basically told in the first  one minute of the film (particulalry in the extended version) and I knew it right then, but it didn't subtract from my enjoyment of the work at all. A scene I loved in particular was where Byrne's character is applying makeup and they play it in reverse- a very simple but effective tool.

The story almost compliments itself on its cleverness and is sure to point out all of the symbolism- in case you were too busy watching all the pretty colors to notice- but its a solid look at that fine line between romance and stalking portrayed in an adult and attractive manner.

Overall, I really liked watching this film and I love listening to the soundtrack. But all of the characters are really creepy- the men AND the women. And if you don't see that, then... well...

...yikes.

EDIT: Its been a day and I don't know if its the soundtrack or what but I'm still thinking about this movie and I want to watch it again.",1107302400,2,2601,4.542735042735043
2173451,2,B00067BBMS,"Wicker Park (Paul McGuigan, 2004)

McGuigan (Gangster No. 1) takes Gilles Mimouni's script for L'Appartement and modifies it for an American audience, coming up with a confusing mess in the process. Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) plays Matt, a photographer who blows off a trip to China to seal the deal on a major account (for what, exactly, is never stated) in order to pursue a woman who disappeared from his life two years ago, Lisa (the gorgeous Diane Kruger, recently seen in National Treasure). This despite him having a fiancee, Rebecca (Jessica Pare; I've no idea if she's any relation to Michael Pare), who happens to be the brother of a bigwig at the company. Oh, well, blowing off the trip to China probably cost him his job anyway. Also involved in all this is Luke (Matthew ""Shaggy"" Lillard), an old friend of Matt's who he ran into by chance a few days previous, and Luke's mysterious girlfriend Alex (Rose Byrne, recently in I Capture the Castle), along with a woman Matt finds while tracking Lisa down.

It actually all makes for a great story, and done properly, it could have been quite a good thriller. However, ""properly"" is not the correct word for this. It's got the same disappointment factor as Christopher Nolan's recent and similarly painful take on Erik Skjoldbaerg's brilliant film Insomnia, and comes with the same recommendation: just rent the original instead. The remake is not worth your time.

The one thing about the movie that makes it worth watching is that it's one of those few moments where we find out Matthew Lillard really can act. This may be the most low-key role he's ever played, and he pulls it off wonderfully; easy the best role I've seen him in since The Curve. Lillard, while no one is looking, is liable to develop into a truly fantastic actor. If you're a fan, this movie is a must-see; for everyone else, don't bother. **",1107129600,,1875,4.710365853658536

Unlike some movies that are intentionally confusing and never come full circle, Wicker Park ties up all the lose ends and makes the unbelievable work, masterfully.
  Josh Harnett and his 2 co-stars are down to earth, well developed and ordinary, their commonality adding even more to the movie and leaving you wistfully wishing that your brief introduction to them could last more than 2 hours.

Let's put it this way, when my wife and I were discussing whether to get it, I was advocating for it, and she was against it.  After it was over, she liked it better than I did.

From a marketing perspective, I think the promoters did not want this to come out as a chick flick, and they wanted young men to buy into it, but I think that blurred the movie's appeal and confused its audience.  It would have done much better if it was targeted more directly and squarely at women 18-35.  If you are in this core demographic, you should like this movie.

I liked the idea used in this film, having been in a similar situation which caused me to be 5 years away from my wife. Oh, it ended well, no matter what.

I really enjoy the type of movie Wicker Park SEEMED to be based upon a trailer I saw for it: a psychological thriller with twists and turns. Well, there are plety of twists and turns all right! Unfortunately, few of them make any logical sense. Basically, Hartnett's character runs around the entire movie trying to find the ""love of his life"" who he has not seen in two years. Like any lame soap opera, the two characters keep just barely missing one another throughout 3/4 of the movie. For example, in one scene they both arrive at the airport, and are literally 100 feet or so from one another. But Hartnett happens to bend down long enough, as Lisa ( the love of his life) stops to offer directions to an old lady. So, of course they miss one another. Then, there is the ""other woman"", just as in much soaps. This other woman spends every waking second of her life trying to scheme to keep Hartnett and Lisa apart. I mean, she literally runs around town, in and out of cabs and apartments, erasing messages and everything, just to make sure Hartnett does not meet up with Lisa. Perhaps the most maddening thing about this movie is that it takes place in the present. Yet... NO ONE GIVES ONE ANOTHER THEIR CELL PHONE NUMBER! The whole conflict could be resolved if Lisa picked up a cell phone and called Hartnett. Instead, they spend the entire movie on pay phones!! What...is this 1984 instead of 2004??? Then the director relies on the old soap opera twist of one character leaving phone messages for the other with the 3rd person who doesn't want them together. It is nuts. Unless this is your idea of a good time ( or you like really bad soap opera plots) avoid this movie at all costs.",1105833600,10,1758,4.445820433436532
2173469,3,B00067BBMS,"""Wicker Park"" was promoted as a thriller, but the occasional suspense is a device rather than the film's focus. It might be better described as a psychological maze or game of blind tag. Matthew (Josh Hartnett) has returned to Chicago after a  2-year absence, having left the city heartbroken that the woman he loved, Lisa (Diane Kruger), had abandoned him with no explanation. Back in Chicago, just as he prepares to jet off to China on business, Matthew thinks he catches a glimpse of Lisa in a restaurant. Obsessed with finding her, he drops everything and sets off on a relentless search, aided halfheartedly by an old friend, Luke (Matthew Lillard), who has romantic troubles of his own. Matthew's search leads him to an apartment occupied by a woman named Lisa (Rose Byrne), sure enough. She happens to wear the same style coat and shoes as his Lisa, but is an entirely different woman who is interested in Matthew nonetheless.

""Wicker Park"" is loosely based on the 1996 French film ""L'Appartement"", and it retains that film's preponderance of flashbacks. Half of the story is told in flashback, as we are being shown two series of events: one that took place 2 years before and one that is contemporary. There is a lot of potential for confusion as the film juggles both identity confusion and temporal uncertainty. But ""Wicker Park"" manages to avoid chaos and present a coherent, if not very affecting, picture of unfulfilled desire. The characters all have their hearts set on being with someone other than the person they have. Everyone loves another, forming a circle of passion and denial. This is intriguing up to a point -the point being when they start playing telephone tag. -Writers and directors take note: this never works as a dramatic device. ""Wicker Park"" toys with being a thriller, but never has enough bite. And it exceeds the quota for coincidences. The film might be an exploration of desire, but most of the characters are too soft around the edges. Rose Byrne's Lisa is the exception. She is the pivot around which the story turns, and Byrne pulls it off. She's intense and vulnerable, crazy and sympathetic, and she should have been more prominent. ""Wicker Park"" isn't bad light entertainment if you don't insist on it having any pay-off. It's just a flat interpretation of interesting ideas.

The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Paul McGuigan and actor Josh Hartnett, 11 deleted scenes, a short gag reel, a music video for Postal Service's bad rendition of ""Against All Odds"", a photo gallery of on-set photos and publicity stills, a promotional spot for the soundtrack, and a theatrical trailer. In the audio commentary, McGuigan and Hartnett discuss filming in Montreal, Canada. It's sporadically interesting, but the commentary is too laid back to be informative.

Obession, lies, deceit all things describing ""Wicker Park""

The movie started off somewhat confusing as the story is mostly told in flashbacks and memories. It held my interest although the plot is highly predictable.

I didn't like the fact that you are anticipating the arrival of a suspensful moment, or some sort of twist and it never comes. They tried to use a little ""twist"" but anyone with half of a brain would know it was coming. The plot almost became aggervating during the last half of the movie.

The ending left me quite dissapointed. I wanted more, an explination of smoe sorts I am guessing.

The music in ""Wicker Park"" was quite enjoyable which is always a plus. All in all, I believe this movie to be worth a look but don't expect too much.",1104710400,,780,4.58273381294964

It is a remake of a 1996 movie called L'Appartement. The movie is basically the story of Harnett's character searching for a lost love who he sees, for the first time in two years, in passing. What makes the movie good is the odd edits and twist the movie takes. You really have no idea what is going on until the movie reaches the end and it really adds to the story. Again, the previews made it look like some kind of supernatural thriller and it is not that at all. It is kind of like the movie Memento where it is edited so oddly that nothing really makes sense until the last 20 minutes.

2173478,4,B00067BBMS,"Despite it's high profile cast (including Josh Hartnett and Matt Lillard) this movie `Wicker Park' feels like an independent movie with its rather quirky yet intelligent storyline, clever use of flashbacks and off-the-wall cinematography.

Perhaps much of that is related to its source material (a French movie). But whatever the reason - I felt myself drawn into this world as a man (Hartnett) throws his career and impending wedding to the wind in an obsessive search for a woman who walked out on him two years earlier.

For anyone who has loved and lost, this movie will strike a chord with you, certainly the girls who watched this movie with me loved it and were left sitting on the edge of their seats as it drew to a close. The acting is simply superb and even Hartnett (who has less than impressed me previously) turns in a convincing performance as a man who seems to awaken out of a trance following a fateful walk to the house telephone at a restaurant.

The movie opens with Hartnett engaged to Rebecca and meeting with his future brother-in-law at a restaurant to conclude details on a merger between his company and a Chinese company. But, as he waits for the house phone to become available he overhears the voice of his former lover who disappeared two years previously and the race is on to find her.

With much of the movie told in flashbacks we learn the details of what happened in the past and are kept two steps ahead of the Hartnett character, who finds another woman in the girls apartment, a friend who is lying to him about an affair with a woman and all manner of machinations that leads him to question his own senses and judgement.

With a very satisfying explanation and some wonderful performances this movie surprisingly delivers. I usually am not a person drawn to independent-type movies but this one is a hit with me.

This DVD is a little short on extras. There are some deleted scenes that offer nothing new, a rather lame and uninteresting audio commentary and a selection of trailers. Perhaps the best special feature (and certainly the only one I enjoyed) is a gag reel, but its all too short.

Here's the thing.  Last August was near the end of a great summer.  I met someone i completely feel for.  We had some amazing friends and spent every day after work together.  Then I come to find out, my love was falling in love with me and got scared so then bailed out.  Its amazing how long it takes to find love and then loose it so quickly.  Thats when I saw this movie for the first time and I realized something.  My life, as well as most other people can identify with someone in this movie to some certain degree.  It's all about lost love.  From the bright dream-like flashbacks of Mathew's (Josh Hartnett) past with former flame Lisa (Diane Kruger) to the almost dark and ominous feel of the present, it brings you into his world.  The one character that blew me away with her depth was ""Lisa"", the nurse that Mathew meets and becomes obsessed with him.  You see, she has the most complex character.  You feel every emotion towards this character.  Curiosity, humility, total hatred, sadness, and pity.  Not nessesarily in that order. There is so much depth and questioning in this movie, you do have to pay attention. If you do get it, which shouldnt be that hard, for anyone with depth, you'll find that this movie is more than a cat-and-mouse chase, it's about the trials of love and lust.  One important line is ""Love will make you do crazy things"".  Well, this is true to an extent.  I think we all can say we ""stalked"" someone to a small degree.  You know, to maybe find out their name or something.  Now, this is extreme stuff, but it'd be a boring movie if they didn't reach into some depth.  I don't want to give it away, but the ending is the BEST ending ever.  I can't say why, but it's the kind of ending people truly wish for.  It's not a hollywood happy ending by any means, but truly a tearjerking ending that plays in slow motion to Coldplay's ""The Scientist"" (which until I saw that will make me teary-eyed everytime I hear it).

2173481,2,B00067BBMS,"Run for your life -- it's a Hollywood remake of a French film. ""Wicker Park"" is an adaptation of the French film ""L'Appartment,"" but being remade in a Chicago setting doesn't do anything for the plot. If anything, the tepid acting and weird script drag down the worthy original film.

A few years ago, Matt (Josh Harnett) was madly in love with Lisa (Diane Kruger), but she vanished mysteriously after not showing up for a meeting with him. Heartbroken, Matt moved from Chicago to NYC. Now he's in another relationship, and is working for his girlfriend's brother. All is well with the world, it seems. But when he stops in Chicago before a business trip, he hears a woman's voice making a phone call -- and becomes convinced that it's Lisa.

Desperate to find Lisa again, Matt enlists his smooth-spoken pal Luke (Matthew Lillard) to help him find Lisa again. He has become obsessed with finding the woman he believes is his one true love. But he runs into another woman (Rose Byrne) who is as obsessed with him as he is with Lisa, and who will do anything to make him hers...

""Men who stalk are true romantics. Women who stalk are lunatics."" Not a sentiment I have any liking for, but it's at the core of ""Wicker Park."" While pretty to look at, this film expects the audience to see the soap-esque scenario as being a representation of true love and obsession. Instead, it feels stylized to the point of being surreal. In a nutshell: Even strange people don't act the way they do in this film.

Paul McGuigan attempts to give this movie a deep, symbolic, artistic feel. Not to mention a soft-edged Tarantino look, with all the flashbacks and the non-linear style. Can he handle it? Not really. More often than not, the movie seems to be getting out of control. Taken purely for visuals, it is a very pretty movie -- lots of beautiful light, shadow, snow and a dreamlike quality.

Josh Harnett gives a practiced but not very compelling turn as Matt. Maybe he would have done better had his character not been a stalker -- the scene where he breaks into the hotel room is simply freaky. Diane Kruger displays her pretty face, but little acting ability or presence. It's Rose Byrne and Matthew Lillard who redeem the acting, with their nuanced performances and hints of real emotion.

Neither a romantic thriller nor a suspense flick, this film isn't sure what to be. While pretty to look at, and having some solid performances, ""Wicker Park"" stumbles over its own delusions of grandeur.",1099612800,13,2486,4.651480637813211
2173482,2,B00067BBMS,"Wicker Park wasn't horrible, it wasn't boring, it wasn't over done... it was just simply annoying.  I hate a movie where someone is trying to find someone else and the whole time they are living right next to eachother or only a few feet apart!  To me, that is annoying... I mean bite your lip and kick the back of the fat guy's (who is munching on goobers) seat in front of you!  The movie was just portrayed differently in the previews.. I thought I was going to see a psychological thriller and instead I found a ""will he ever find her?"" kind of movie.  When he finally finds her... it is a touching moment but by this point the plot had been so strecthed out that the viewer was exasperated.  I mean these two characters crossed paths a bizillion times, and never saw each other...and all because of some crazy girl!!  It was just too text book.. nothing to surprise the viewer and it was falsly advertised much like Cold Creek Manor... I mean how many of us thought we were going to see a ghost movie and instead had to sit through story about a crazy guy.  Wicker Park is a story of a crazy girl and her attempt to keep the boy she loves away from his one true love.  It could have been good but it was just as if the director soaked ever moment he could to build up the ending when in fact the viewer was ready for it to end long before it actually did!  Oh and how about a weather change?  Man I was cold just watching it!",1098748800,,1430,4.148550724637682
2173483,4,B00067BBMS,"First I have never watched the French film to which the other reviews have referred. So maybe that helped me enjoy this movie. Perhaps, I am biased, having lost someone I loved very much without warning and with no explanation, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I loved the camera work, the music was perfect for the film's mood and all the stars were fantastic. I thought Hartnett and Kruger had great chemistry. I would have to agree I was worried after watching Diane in Troy but she did in fact redeem herself in Wicker Park. Josh Hartnett has a quality that is just breathtaking to me--he totally seems this part--sensitive and feeling. I could feel the pain of all the stars. I felt this movie and maybe that's why I loved it so much. It made me feel love, pain, love, loss and love again. I cried at the ending and couldn't wait to watch it again. I for one cannot wait to buy the upcoming DVD.",1098748800,3,903,4.380952380952381
2173484,2,B00067BBMS,"Run for your life -- it's a Hollywood remake of a French film. ""Wicker Park"" is an adaptation of the French film ""L'Appartment,"" but being remade in a Chicago setting doesn't do anything for the plot. If anything, the tepid acting and weird script drag down the worthy original film.

A few years ago, Matt (Josh Harnett) was madly in love with Lisa (Diane Kruger), but she vanished mysteriously after not showing up for a meeting with him. Heartbroken, Matt moved from Chicago to NYC. Now he's in another relationship, and is working for his girlfriend's brother. All is well with the world, it seems. But when he stops in Chicago before a business trip, he hears a woman's voice making a phone call -- and becomes convinced that it's Lisa.

Desperate to find Lisa again, Matt enlists his smooth-spoken pal Luke (Matthew Lillard) to help him find Lisa again. He has become obsessed with finding the woman he believes is his one true love. But he runs into another woman (Rose Byrne) who is as obsessed with him as he is with Lisa, and who will do anything to make him hers...

""Men who stalk are true romantics. Women who stalk are lunatics."" Not a sentiment I have any liking for, but it's at the core of ""Wicker Park."" While pretty to look at, this film expects the audience to see the soap-esque scenario as being a representation of true love and obsession. Instead, it feels stylized to the point of being surreal. In a nutshell: Even strange people don't act the way they do in this film.

Paul McGuigan attempts to give this movie a deep, symbolic, artistic feel. Not to mention a soft-edged Tarantino look, with all the flashbacks and the non-linear style. Can he handle it? Not really. More often than not, the movie seems to be getting out of control. Taken purely for visuals, it is a very pretty movie -- lots of beautiful light, shadow, snow and a dreamlike quality.

Josh Harnett gives a practiced but not very compelling turn as Matt.

2173485,2,B00067BBMS,"The trailor for ""Wicker Park"" would have you believe that this is a ""Fatal Attraction"" kind of film. A crazy stalker type who is obsessive from afar at first and then takes matters into her own hands, which is partly true of this film minus the intense climaxes, and endlessly deep characters.

The audience never really gets a feel for the true Matt (played by heart-throb Josh Hartnett) we don't connect with his background or his personality. The audience is just thrown into the middle of this chronilogically deficient love story, thats why we aren't too concerned with how hurt he is in the numerous scenes where he's left weeping.

The direction by Paul McGuigan is confusing and scattered. It didn't seem like he was sure of where he wanted to go with the film as judging by the complete disarray of the scene sequencing. The audience is left in a frustrating state of perplexity thoughout the entire film due to its constant flashbacks. Flashbacks are a technique often used to give background but mostly seen in a different cinematogaphy to differenciate their meaning, i.e. black and white or fast forwarding a narrated scene or slow motion with a previous monologue as used in classics like ""Momento"".

The inadequate soundtrack was best fit for a film with more intensity and detracked from what was actually appealing. Finally the only redeeming quality this film possesses is its impeccable choice of casting for the part of Luke, Matt's best friend, played by the always reliable Matthew Lillard, who gave his usual comic relief perfomance and yet captured the audience with his schoolboy charm.",1095206400,6,1611,4.937269372693727
2173486,2,B00067BBMS,"I was so excited to see this movie because of Josh Hartnett but was so disappointed. I thought it was going to be a psycho suspense thriller but I was wrong. It starts off confusing from the beginning and just sprials downward from there getting increasingly frustrating. The actors do a fair job, including Josh but the boring drama of a mentally ill woman just screwing up other people's lives gets in the way. It is not scary or suspensefull at all, it's just boring. The best part was by far Matthew Lillard who threw his little quirky way into an otherwise dead movie. I would not reccomend this movie at all, but if you must- wait till it's on tape!!!",1094515200,5,657,4.43801652892562
8039704,5,B00067BBMS,"PRETTY BLOWN AWAY. Who would've f*****g thought there were so many Lisa's. I felt like everywhere I turned I saw a Lisa. Lost all sense of time and space about 15 mins into this. Also who the f*** was the stalker??????????????????? I think the whole stalker thing calls for a second movie. Also, feeling type Lisa betrayed right now that THIS WASN'T ABOUT WICKER PARK. I have a qualm about the fact that I only watched this ""movie"" to learn about the historical neighborhood of Wicker Park and only got shots of boring white people in a love quadrangle instead. Only giving this a five star because ""what really did it for me was all the Lisa's"" - Ms. Stonebraker.
