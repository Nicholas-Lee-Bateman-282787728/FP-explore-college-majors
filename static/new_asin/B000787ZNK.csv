8208008,4,B000787ZNK,"I'd give this full marks for the fun fight scenes & unique art style, but the black spaces where commercials used to be kind of drive me crazy. Also, this is subbed not dubbed, which I think should be indicated in the purchase/rent specs.",1453852800,,238,4.431818181818182
8208009,4,B000787ZNK,Going in to purchase this item I didn't expect a stellar product. Regardless the item itself came in good condition and the content was quite entertaining. The voices don't quite match and the acting is pretty laughable but that gives this anime a charm that most other dubbed animes will never achieve. Most of the acting talent sounds new so it won't be too hard to listen to and the actors admittedly do a fantastic job at matching their Japanese counterparts (both voices can be found on the disc). It's definitely watchable and if you don't go into it expecting amazing acting then you'll come out of it amazed by the intense fight scenes while at the same timed charmed by the loveable voice acting.,1232236800,,705,4.648
8208010,4,B000787ZNK,"In Airmaster Volume 2, the plot takes a slightly more serious tone with the arrival on the scene of a fearsome fighter named Julietta Sakamoto. Not only does he have a nonchalant vicious kick but his punches are the equivalent of industrial piledrivers, he also knows all the moves to get the ladies! Even Maki falls under his spell and gets her first kiss, to the horror of Mina. He just might be her most dangerous opponent yet, so she seeks out a new test to get ready to fight Julietta...fighting her own father!

The second volume of this series maybe takes a wrong turn down the dramatic side as the character of Julietta might be more at home in The Silence of the Lambs than here. His stalking of Maki becomes a little disturbing after a while, and puts a psychotic bent on an otherwise fun show. Oh well, after all the histrionics of the first 3 episodes on this dvd, we get back to business with a beach and bikinis episode in #8.

Like Volume 1, there are zero extras on this disk. It even lacks chapter stops and scene selections, which is kind of annoying when you want to skip past the beginning and end credits. Also, like Volume 1, the subtitles here are close-captioned, meaning not only the dialogue is translated but also the sounds are described in subtitles, like ""laughing scared"", ""puffing with exertion"", etc. I had heard of this problem with the second Ghost in the Shell movie but this is my first experience with this problem. It is quite distracting and unexcusable.",1113091200,,1494,4.550185873605948
8208011,5,B000787ZNK,"In these four episodes, follow Maki as she is stalked by a freak, gets in a fight with her streetfighting father, almost loses to her kid sister and, oh yeah, enters a beach themed beauty contest with the rest of the gang, Mina included. Now that's a tight bathing suit!

Anyway, the fight between Maki and Julietta Sakamoto, which is the centerpiece for this DVD, was superb. So was her short match with her father and sister. This show has an odd sense of humor which I enjoy overall, but it is the sweet little fights that make it worth while.",1112659200,,546,4.405940594059406
