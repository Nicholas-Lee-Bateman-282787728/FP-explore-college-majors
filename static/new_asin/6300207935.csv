227357,5,6300207935,"I did not know a thing about this movie when I ordered it, but any flick with Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper, Anthony Quinn, and Ward Bond couldn't be that bad, could it??  Well I watched it last night twice and was blown away by its genre bending script and style.  What a fun flick...............Barbara channels Martha Ivers and her great Double Indemnity femme fatale role as one brassy broad.  Gary Cooper underplays his role as always with magnificent results.  Ruth Roman almost steals the movie as Cooper's grifter girlfriend.  The best scene in the flick is the woman to woman talk between her and Stanwyck.........................meow meow!

I easily counted Treasure of The Sierra Madre, Wages of Hear, Double Indemnity, and Out of the Past as movies that influenced this effort.....Ruth Roman has a very Jane Greer like quality in this movie.

As always Olive Films presents this movie ia a very pristine transfer..................Highly recommended for film noir buffs..a pure delight.",1372032000,12,997,5.19375
227358,3,6300207935,"A real potboiler with Stanwyck running roughshod over her estimable co-stars, Gary Cooper, Anthony Quinn, and the under-rated Ruth Roman.  The setting is the oil-fields of Mexico and, to top off the melodramatic posh, Frankie Laine incessantly sings the movie's non-hit theme song. Totally, compulsively watchable nonsense.",1370995200,,323,5.872340425531915
227359,4,6300207935,"this is a very interesting movie that is worth buying,about anything gary cooper is in should be good and barbbara stanwyck works well with him but olive films charges to much for there movies and don't give you extras with there movie",1369612800,,235,4.619047619047619
227360,5,6300207935,"Thus says Barbara Stanwyck as only she can to Gary Cooper who then proceeds to nearly choke the liver out of her!!  This film is lambasted by most critics (who don't know anything).  But it is a fun movie to watch from start to finish!  The characterizations by the principals are first-rate with Stanwyck the stand out.  No one could beat her in a Western.  And she's a baddie to boot, rotten to the core.  Quinn and Cooper are excellent as well!  With a haunting score (Frankie Laine singing the title song)this Western is a dandy.",1133913600,25,533,4.489583333333333
227361,5,6300207935,"Gary Cooper was never more Gary Cooperish than in this rugged modern western.  Here, Cooper plays Jeff Dawson, a hapless oil speculator in South America whose misadventures reunite him with an old friend, Paco (played strongly by Anthony Quinn).  Unfortunately for Jeff, Paco's wife is bad-news, man-eating Marina (the ever hot Barbara Stanwyck), the lover Jeff ran away from years ago, undoubtedly knowing that despite his lust for her, she was just no good.  And Marina is as sexy as ever despite her iron gray hair and flat out cruelty to Paco, whom she plainly considers a wimp.

Nonstop action follows as Jeff fights the elements--including banditos and the heat--and, MUCH more importantly, his hormones.  A scene in which Cooper and his sidekick Dutch (Ward Bond) navigate a hot, bumpy road in a truck full of explosives, with banditos trailing them all the way, might be a metaphor for Jeff's romantic entanglements: Marina chases Jeff like a hungry animal, and though he could never love such a vulture, the passion is palpable and explosive.  So he flees into the arms of Sal (Ruth Roman), a pretty woman he meets along the way and soon falls for.

The main characters are expertly written and acted--especially Paco, who (we learn) used to be mister tough guy but now likes to play it safe seeing as he's got a wife and a fortune to protect.  Alas, his caution only triggers his wife's contempt.  Quinn is so good here he might have stolen the movie had the leading parts been played by other than the likes of Cooper and Stanwyck.

As Jeff, Cooper has to walk a tightrope: we've got to believe that bad girl Marina turns him on, but also that he's a good guy who wants to do right by his buddy Paco.  As usual, Cooper succeeds in this delicate balance.

An aging Stanwyck simply personifies lust as Marina, despite Marina's lack of a single other redeeming virtue.  In the fifties, Stanwyck would play a lot of these western Lady Macbeth types--thoroughly rotten, all fire and ice, and yet somehow irresistible to men.  Not very nuanced roles, but nobody--and I mean nobody--could have done them better.

Supporting characters Dutch and Sal don't really get to develop as much as I'd hoped.  Both have some interesting scenes early on, but the second half of the movie belongs solely to Cooper, Stanwyck, and Quinn.  Still, Bond and Roman both do a great job.

A word about the dialogue: very good and avoids clich.  The setting too is interesting and fresh.  Strongly recommended.",1122681600,22,2493,4.780373831775701
227362,4,6300207935,"What a strange movie this is. Not quite a genre movie, not quite a soap opera, not quite high drama. It starts out as a loose reworking of TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE, then veers into WAGES OF FEAR territory, before becoming a  dark romantic drama, and finally ending as high adventure. Whether it works  depends on one's feelings about just how much latitude a movie has in  refashioning itself as the story unfolds. For me, I can watch this and  almost laugh outloud at the absurd going's-on, and then watch it another  time and find it absolutely fascinating. Its very weirdness becomes  hallucinatory. Cooper, Stanwyck and Quinn are all very good, though you  wonder how they kept their roles straight as it bounced from one type movie  to another. There's a side of me that believes this movie has improved with  age. Because it breaks so many story-telling ""rules"", it plays  better in today's market. Indeed, there is almost something  independent-looking about the entire production. But since Cooper was the  number one box office star in the world in 1953, had just snagged his  second Academy Award (HIGH NOON), it is hard to believe this was an indy.  But, HIGH NOON was an indy, why not this? Take a chance on it.",952819200,20,1223,4.7075471698113205

From Frankie line's opening theme by Dimitri Tiomkin to the introduction of Gary Cooper and Ward Bond's characters It's very different look a Gary Cooper for those ""High Noon"" lovers, of which I am one. The soap opera that comes from the Coop's relationship with his Ex Barbara Stanwyck who is very evil in this and Paco played well alway by Oscar winner Anthony Quinn.

Panorama is missing where expected, vast oil fields are reduced to what, someone's backyard.  Sorry, but this picture, COOPER and STANWYCK, fails.

Everything supports the core of the script and maybe that is also what makes it good.  Good quality black and white didn't need color to catch the glints in their eyes nor the sexual heightening in their faces.  Add some shoot 'em up and a side interest of love and it's just a darn good movie.  The underlying ""Black Gold"" music adds atmosphere to the tensions and misguided passions.",1387324800,,663,4.780701754385965
227728,5,6300207935,"A fabulous, but little heralded, film with a dream cast. It borrows elements from a dozen other better known classic movies but isn't like any of them. The screenplay veers off into several different directions naturally, keeping the viewer constantly off-guard. Cooper and Stanwyck have never been better, Quinn is superb. And the action never stops",1385769600,,350,5.267857142857143

7805211,3,6300207935,"Just ok.  These are all great actors, but not one I would ever want to watch again.  Ms. Stanwyck was wasted in this ""man hungry"" plot.",1476230400,,135,4.153846153846154
7805212,5,6300207935,"Coop in his twilight, yet he still hits it out of the park.  Anthony Quinn, Barbara Stanwyck, Ruth Roman, others, all turn in great performances.  The theme song itself is very haunting and I loved both the movie and song so much, that I ordered from Amazon Frankie Laine's CD just for that one song.  Not Rawhide, not Gunfight at the OK Corral, just this one song.  I loved Coop in his twilight in Vera Cruz, but admittedly he and Burt Lancaster were just turning in some stellar performances together in what was otherwise a badly written and poorly directed movie.  Same for Garden of Evil, great Coop acting, but a terrible movie.  In Blowing Wild you get old Coop at his best, even if aged, in fact that's what makes this film to me on a par with High Noon.  He's vulnerable but he's still all man.  Stanwyck, Roman and Quinn turn in great performances also.  Together this movie should have been one of his best known, although critics said otherwise.  Working folks often conflict with art critics, however.",1473638400,,1014,4.583333333333333
7805213,4,6300207935,"Cooper is great as the principled, and broke, oil entrepreneur that is determined to make his money the old fashioned way, by earning it, regardless of bandits or ""friends"" with baggage.  Quinn, as Paco, over acts as usual, playing the impulsive and emotional best friend who couldn't understand why the Cooper character left suddenly and without explanation several years ago.  Although I don't understand how Barbara Stanwick was cast as the femme fatale in this movie and others, as she is not physically attractive imho, her strong acting ability, on display here, is probably the answer to my confusion. Plus, she's a heck of a horse woman. A race between her character on a fast horse and Paco in his car made me genuinely fear for the horse and rider. Intense tension builds between the friends untill finally resolved in a gruesome betrayal. Will Cooper escape with the girl and his reputation?",1473465600,,902,4.927631578947368
