4597776,5,B0057Z22AY,"I have a 5-year-old grandson with autism. Even though I have read many articles on the subject, I never really understood all the implications of the condition, how it manifests, how to respond to the child or the future outlook for him. This TV program opened my eyes to all that is involved and how the family can render loving care and understanding in a far better way. It opened me up to talk about this event in our family with others and have been so surprised to learn of others, like myself, who had never opened up and spoken of this family problem with others......even to some whom they knew well. I made this purchase to view from time to time to keep me on track and to loan to others. Thanks for making the available at a fair price with the free shipping.  If you as a customer of Amazon are reading this review, PLEASE take this to heart and buy the DVD....it is worth far more than the price!!!!",1320364800,,913,4.308139534883721

4597794,5,B0057Z22AY,"As a mom parenting autism spectrum disorder in our U.S. adopted son, I was notably impressed with the whole documentary on Autism Now. Great discussion! GREAT talk with the doctors and professors. I am of the gut-brain connection mindset as to its participating role in autism children. I was thrilled to hear a Harvard doc even touching on its validity in her research! Means to me it's trying to remedy is a huge hopefilled endeavor. I also like the reality this look gave into our lives daily. Of course, no one will ever know until they live it. Perhaps this should be a gift to our family members to try to help gain their understanding into our challenges.",1396483200,3,662,4.61864406779661

8461193,1,B0057Z22AY,"I only watched the first episode because I was disappointed in Robert MacNeil's report as it mentioned the possible link between autism and the MMR vaccine.  The diagnosis of autism was defined in 1908 as an off-shoot of schizophrenia and since then there has been a strong connection been made to genetic factors.  Of the outside factors found the Rubella virus ranks highest and encephalitis caused by mumps next.  The MMR, which is the Measles Mumps and Rubella vaccine, is the surest way to prevent the rubella/mumps viruses from infecting individuals.  Many blame a preservative in the vaccine as the cause of autism ... which has not been found credible. How do we stop the these viruses in their tracks?  Vaccinating against them!  I was a school nurse who was certified in developmental disabilities and have done my research.  Please don't let unsubstantiated reports like this prevent you from giving necessary vaccinations to your children!",1485993600,,951,5.096774193548387

8461199,4,B0057Z22AY,"As a develomental physical therapist, this is definitely a must see for anyone who is involved with children with developmental disorders - and not just autism. The series give the viewer a multifaceted perspective on what happens around the lives of not just the child but also those who care for her - including parents, educators, caregivers, extended family, siblings, researchers, and even legislators. The series also bring to light that despite how much we have learned about autism, much of what is really vital about the condition is yet to be discovered. For example, while it gives anecdotal evidence based on parent reporting on the plausible cause of their child's condition, the series simply discard these parent reporting based on what is generally referred to as ""public health research"" or ""scientific research"" -that none of the parents' reportings have a true measureable basis. The series also showcase signs of our current systems inability to cope with those affected, for example, through the lack of a general template (for example in the school setting or job training) that will allow those affected by the condition to become beyond the stereotype opportunities often given to individuals with autism.
Overall, if anything, the series at least touches on superficial aspects of what goes on with individuals with ASD and the people who care for them.
It would be nice if the producers will look into doing another series, eg, exploring why for example, vaccines are being suspected by parents and even researchers and pediatricians as possible environmental hazards that may tip individuals to manifesting signs of ASD; everyday providers (therapists and educators) and demonstrating some specific ways they are able to make a difference in the functional levels of the individuals they care for; or even a multinational view of the condition and how it is affecting children outside of the US and what those other contries are doing to help these individuals.",1468886400,3,1988,5.196261682242991
