8298745,1,B001ELTLIQ,"I give every movie a chance. I'm not one of those people that think that big budget means better. There are some low budget movies out there that are good but this movie is not one of those exceptions. I saw this movie online and the site I watched it on it had a two star average(out of five). That means people predominately hated it and this is a site that's populated by everybody.

The story: Auto Recovery details Slim(Aaron Frazier), Ralph(Tyrone Burton of the Parent'Hood) and Corey(Brian Keith Hall), 3 car thieves. Corey wants to turn his life around.

The story of a guy that does wrong and wants to turn his life around is not new but this movie handled it in such a heavy-handed fashion that made it hard to watch without wincing. Now to avoid saying something cliche' like worst movie I've ever seen(which the robots..oops I meant reviewers on Amazon usually say), I'll break down everything that's wrong with it.

Acting: cardboard boxes have more personality than these guys. They are the most boring brothers I've ever seen on film. Wooden like a fence post best describes everybody's performance. Its as if they were tired of the lame script said the hell with it. You'd think the guy that played T.K. on the Parent'Hood had some personality..guess again! Dude is very bland. He's just there for the ladies to swoon over.

Dialogue: Mostly consists of the word ""dog"" and ""man"". I guess that's a step up from saying the ""N"" word a bunch of times but after hearing ""dog"" and ""man"" a  bunch of times it gets rather dull(like this movie). A skillful writer can write a good screenplay that isn't peppered with profanity, so i guess the writer deserves a little credit for that. But a skillful writer can also write a script with dialogue that doesn't get redundant after 5 minutes. You feel me, man? Word dog. Let's continue

Pacing: This movie moves at a snail's pace. I know that this is a drama but every great drama like Soul Food, Lackawanna Blues, Eve's Bayou etc didn't move at a fast speed but they weren't this slow either. Plus those movies were interesting but this one is not.

Sound: whoever did the sound needs to be kicked in the rear. I swore at times I was hearing the theme music for The Three Stooges or Laurel & Hardy in the background. Plus you'd hear these flaws in the sound area at the most inopportune time.

Story: So dull that you have to force yourself to be attentive to it. Anytime you have to feign attention for a movie its usually not a good sign.

There you have it. Everything wrong with this movie summed up in this review. Now I know some people are going to say that you cant expect a low budget movie to be as good as a big budget movie. My reply: GET REAL! There are plenty of low budget movies that are just as good as big budget pictures. Some of them are even better than some of these big budget bloopers that are released nowadays. I know that throwing money at a movie does not make it better but Im not blaming big money as the reason why this movie stinks. I blame the writer of this movie as well as the actors. If the writer would have put some thought into what he writes this movie could have been better. If the actors would put some type of emotions into their roles they could have made this banal movie a bit bearable. Neither happened and the world is stuck with the most boring low budget Black drama ever made. Auto Recovery: the perfect cure for chronic insomnia.",1237075200,3,3437,4.434231378763867
