8308807,1,B001HJXK3M,"**** BUYER BEWARE,BEWARE OF QUALITY, ***, there seems to be at least 4 different people or studios putting this movie up for sale on amazon,

*** I made the mistake of ordering the version that was from studio A2zcds.com *** ,

 ***THE QUALITY WAS AWFUL,IT WAS A DVD-R, NOT TOLD UPFRONT IN THE AD, EVEN THOUGH THE AD SAID ""REMASTERED VERSION"", THE DISC WAS FUZZY AND LOADED WITH PIXELATION, UNWATCHABLE ***

amazon was kind enough to return my money, unfortunately it scared me from buying one of the other three versions being offered , one is by alpha studios, not known for really great print quality, the other two were more expensive, though in all fairness they may be nice prints, im not sure, I was just too afraid to take another chance, if anybody else can shed some light as to the quality of the other versions please leave some explicit feedback, the movie is a piece of nostalgia history as a b movie and as a johnny cash rare film.
I don't like giving negative reviews, but this time I felt the need to speak up and save someone else from the same bad experience.",1342224000,3,1078,4.456852791878172
8308808,5,B001HJXK3M,"Johnny Cash Plays a villain who teams up with a criminal to rob a bank. Cash ends up kidnapping the vice president of the banks wife, and holding her for ransom while Cash's partner holds up the bank. Cash does an outstanding job of his acting and guitar playing skills in this film. If you are a Johnny Cash fan I would recommend getting this film.",1223510400,6,349,4.303030303030303
