8653807,5,B002ZNT7AO,My husband started coaching softball for the first time this season so I bought this dvd to help him out. We found it helpful with easy to follow instructions by a experienced coach and while seeing young girls showing how to do certain drills. The drills and advice is not just shown but reasons to why it is recommended is also stated which was helpful when our team of 7-9 year olds would ask why we did such drills. I recommend this to all coaches and parents of softball players.,1367798400,,484,4.388888888888889
