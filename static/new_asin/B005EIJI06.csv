4665446,3,B005EIJI06,"I had heard about this film, and that it was an underrated classic, made on a shoestring budget. ""Classic"" may be overdoing it a bit, but the plot was interesting and tight, and at points the film was nicely atmospheric.
Seemed a bit like a nicely done television episode from the 60's perhaps along the lines of the Alfred Hitchcock hour. It would be interesting to see what the director could do with more $ and better actors.",1394064000,5,428,4.5

4665448,5,B005EIJI06,"As a film study and screenwriter student, I found Detour to be the epitome of what the Noir genre represents thematically and visually. All the classic Noir trademarks are in this short film; the femme fatale, hard boiled dialogue, voice over narration, and the low angle low key lighting.",1381708800,10,289,4.918367346938775

4665450,5,B005EIJI06,"DETOUR is one of the greatest examples of film noir in American cinema!  It's a gritty, sordid little thriller running little more than an hour, a gem on the dung heap of Poverty Row programmers--doubtless the best thing to ever come out of PRC, the lowest of the low-budget studios in Hollywood's Golden Age.  Director Edgar G. Ulmer mad at least two classic genre films:  the horror thriller THE BLACK CAT (1934) with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and this tale of a hitch-hiking piano player (Tom Neal) and the stunningly bad luck he encounters as he tries to cross the country on his thumb.  Upon further reflection, though, the viewer is left asking a rather weighty question:  does Al Roberts suffer from bad luck, or does he make bad decisions, or is it a combination of both?  Such existential musings are unheard of in most Poverty Row productions, which makes DETOUR all the more wonderful.  It can be seen for free on Amazon or other sources, so I urge everyone to check it out NOW!",1468713600,3,994,4.613636363636363

4665453,2,B005EIJI06,"Detour, 1945 film

The film opens on a lonely two-lane blacktop highway. Its geography suggests southern California. A man walks along the highway until he gets a ride. The juke box plays a big record, the tune brings back memories. We see what happened before to Al the piano player. A long distance call is handled by dozens of operators. Al hitchhikes across country to Los Angeles. One man, Charles Haskell, picks him up and tells about his past life. Then something goes terribly wrong. Al switches clothes and takes Haskell's identification, then drives to California. Al picks up a woman by a gas station, Vera is going to Los Angeles. Later there is a surprise from Vera! She is trouble.

Vera and Al register as Mr. & Mrs. Charles Haskell. ""I'm always right."" Their conversation tells about their characters. They don't sell the car. They dine at a drive-in diner. Vera has big ideas. The monetary figures date this film. An argument results in more bad luck for Al. He leaves, but an unforeseen event occurs to end this story.

A better script could improve this low-budget story. The idea of impersonation of a stranger was used in other films and stories. If Vera was thrown out of Haskell's automobile why would she return to it? It does teach of the problems that come from making a wrong decision (picking up a stranger hitchhiker).",1443052800,,1347,4.723404255319149

One man's detour into destruction, led by a believable femme fatale who destroys both their dreams.",1436140800,,292,4.979591836734694
4665456,5,B005EIJI06,"Tom Neal is awesome. His character falls deeper and deeper into hell as the movie progresses.sort of like his real life downfall. Tarantino must have watched this film and took notes. Ann Savage brings true terror in her performance. She is totally nuts.

Much of this was filmed in the Antelope Valley which perked my interest even more.

4665457,3,B005EIJI06,This movie had a plot that went nowhere and an ending that just signified that the film's time was up. In every melancholy movie there is at least a small part that lets you smile or take an emotional rest from persistent tension. This film failed to provide that despite a decent acting job by the main characters.,1428192000,2,315,4.448275862068965

4665460,4,B005EIJI06,"Good noir, suffers just a bit from either leaving pieces on cutting room floor or dropping scenes from the original short story.  Still, it has its dark quality.",1417305600,,161,4.75
4665461,4,B005EIJI06,"Tom Neal plays one of the most pathetic characters yet, moving from bitter nightclub pianist would-be concert hall pianist (although the way he bangs on the keyboards, it's no wonder he never made it) to meek hitchhiker whose bad (really inexplicable) choice seals his fate.  The direction, camera angles, pacing, over-the-top hardcore female manipulator - it's a ""poverty row quickie"" all right.  You really have to suspend your disbelief and desire for a plausible script, but it is a film worth watching.  Unfortunately, Amazon Instant Video doesn't include a ""Cast"" option with this film, so I had no idea who any of these actors were or what other work they've done; thank goodness for IMDb.  Ann Savage plays one of the meanest, most savage female characters I've ever seen in a movie, outside of the evil character Rae Parkins in ""The Gauntlet"".  When Neal hooks up with Savage, his character morphs into a ludicrous milquetoast - he's simply not the brightest light bulb in the box.",1411084800,2,990,4.9397590361445785

8468334,5,B005EIJI06,"Very watchable film. Writing, acting, the ability to identify with 'Roberts' as Vera calls him, literally, and barks at him all create solid entertainment plus thoughtful musings about the human condition , so score 4-star. 5 star for great art in and of itself, as illustrated in part by the following:  for showing ---because this was made in an era when values were never seen as something made up as one 'goes along' ---and one is not here for 'going along,' Ulmer's characterizations exemplify war time and post WWII sentiments exactly in the way typified by French Existentialism, among other elements and themes.
