5581845,4,B00BDZV8TI,It is a very good crime show about the California Highway Patrol. I grwe up watching it and it brings back a lot of memories. I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime shows.,1366934400,4,179,4.142857142857143
5581846,5,B00BDZV8TI,"This is a perfect quality DVD of Highway Patrol from the good 'ol 1955-59 era.  Highly recommend this production as it is quality for your viewing pleasure.  Professional packaging, labeling and boxes.  The cost was very attrictive, so I also received Season 3 and 2...all of the same attributes.  Happy viewing...!",1366848000,3,315,5.117647058823529
5581847,5,B00BDZV8TI,"If you are a serious Broderick Crawford fan and a Highway Patrol fan, you will want this and the other seasons as part of your collection. The episodes are clear and very easy to view.

5581848,5,B00BDZV8TI,"Highway Patrol Season 4 arrived a few days back and I finally got around to viewing it yesterday.  Put it in the player and was amazed with the pristine video transfer and Broderick Crawford's character Det Matthews.  Having been a 40 year law enforcement veteran during the years this was on TV brought back many memories.  Loved seeing all the old Chrysler Dodges and Plymouths.  General Motors Pontiacs, Buicks and Chevrolets were neat also.  Saw few Ford products.  Stories were believable and entertaining.  A lot of on-site photography outside of interior studio shots added to the realism.  Highly recommend this series.  Have pre-ordered all seasons.  You cannot beat the $12.99 price and the quality.......anywhere.  Buy it before the price goes up.",1365379200,28,758,5.181818181818182
5581849,5,B00BDZV8TI,"This is a superior image/sound transfer,better than anything else out there. Possibly MGM has something to do with TGG Direct as the quality of Vol 1 MGM was as good,but not selling as well because of the 50 dollar plus price. Somebody got smart and figured it is better to sell alot of 22 dollar units than a few 55-59 dollar ones. I received season 4 today and am impressed,can t wait for 2 and 3. Why 4 first?  Based on this quality from TGG Direct,see no reason not to order Sea Hunt series as well.",1365120000,17,503,4.239583333333333

5581851,5,B00BDZV8TI,I have enjoyed watching this show for several months. I find that all shows are addictive and can not get enough-stay up way late but they are worth watching. If you like Dragnet this is most likely to be another good cop show. I can not say anything bad about the show except the fact I wish they had tons more to watch. If you like old cars then this is rather nice to check them out. I would give this show a 5 star rating.,1364083200,15,426,3.9651162790697674

5581909,5,B00BDZV8TI,"This campy, no nonsense police drama was a syndicated program from the beginning. Broderick Crawford was perfect for this, as a droll, fast talking, cop. Sometimes he said his dialogue so fast, it was hard to understand him.  Got to love the vintage squad cars used in these episodes. Love the 1958 Buicks the best. The story lines were straight forward, the dialogue played by the actors, felt wooden at times. Very generic logos on the police cars, license plates, and when a description of a vehicle they were after was radioed into headquarters, the make and model of the vehicle were never used. only something like a ""light blue hardtop"", etc.... Realistically, this wouldn't happen, but it IS a campy tv show. Still fun to watch after all these years. The video quality and sound is pretty good too. Don't want to forget the announcer- the famous Art Gilmore.",1445472000,,866,4.773333333333333

5581950,5,B00BDZV8TI,"By the time the fourth season of this show came around it was obvious to me that the script writers were continuing to pack plenty of action into this half hour show with plenty of action.  Highway Patrol is one of those classic T.V. shows that continues to entertain viewers long after it went off the air.  In fact a fifth series was already in the works but Broderick Crawford decided not to continue with the series saying ""We are simply running out of crimes.""
  This show was and still is a classic that should not be missed.",1429574400,2,531,4.387755102040816

5581973,5,B00BDZV8TI,"I love watching these 50s programs. The cars, the unpaved roads, the small cities and towns, what a blast from the past! They tell quite a story in just 25 minutes. Find a drama today that runs only 25 minutes (30 minutes with commercials). Academy Award winning actor Broderick Crawford is Dan Matthews, the head of the Highway Patrol office. Great stories. There's nothing like seeing '57 and '58 Fords in primo condition. So cool. So fun. You should check it out. 10-4?",1425945600,7,472,4.698795180722891

We all agree that Steve McQueen was cool and we all agree that Charles Bronson was tough.
Edge did the math:
Steve McQueen + Charles Bronson = DAN MATTHEWS
Don't be scared.  Dan Matthews is on our side.  Edge says buy Highway Patrol Season 4 right now.  If you don't buy it, not only are you a loser, you will regret it for the rest of your life.",1423353600,,493,4.09375

5582009,5,B00BDZV8TI,"Highway Patrol Season Four for the 58/59 season goes out with a bang. After four years Art Gilmore's narration is finally retired. This season has seen some nifty actors come and go,among them are:Ken Drake,frequently seen in ZIV TV's other big hit Sea Hunt,William Boyett who was Broderick Crawford's sidekick in most eps,Leonard Nimoy(Star Trek),Ted Knight(Mary Tyler Moore),veteran actor Gene Roth known as a heavy from Three Stooges shorts at Columbia,Billy Halop from the Bowery Boys(the third actor from the group to make it to HP),Mexican-American actor Rodolfo Hoyos,Charles Maxwell,well known in the TV circuit appearing in Bonanza,Sea Hunt,Gilligan's Island, and so many more,Robert Conrad(Wild,Wild West),Robert Fuller,another well known character actor on TV in hits like Laramie,Emergency,Wagon Train,and on and on,Dyan Cannon,actress in TV and films,spelled Diane here(most sources I see have her making her first TV appearance elsewhere but THIS is the show that she really first debuted in),and others.
And speaking of UFOs,did you know there is an ep here with an honest to goodness UFO appearing in it,and quite plainly I might add? Watch the ep ""Killer on the Run"".During the last five minutes there are two women who are stopped by a guy with a gun. As he gets out of the car and approaches their car watch the hillside in the background. From right to left over it comes a roundish,smooth and quiet object. It is close enough that you see that there are no appendages so it isn't a plane and if it was,it would make a noise. It is quiet. It is moving at about the speed of a plane so it is too fast to be a blimp. It is shaped like two inverted pie plates together. I have watched that segment,which last about 6 -8 seconds, over and over,on normal view and close up. It is astonishing to watch. As the man/actor reaches the car the scene cuts to a different angle and the object is gone. It seems almost impossible that someone didn't see it. I would like to think the cameraman did and kept rolling and that footage is still with someone or the Air Force has it. Who knows? Watch it and be amazed for yourself. With all the cameras out and about in Hollywood,then and now,it isn't the first time UFOs have been caught be startled crews.
UFOs aside,this season like the rest looks like it was filmed yesterday. I must say though that the first season done by MGM seems just slightly clearer than the rest by TGG, as their eps were limited to four a disc,whereas these are double that. More compression,more grain. However that's just a minor point.
I found also this season, Broderick Crawford appeared a bit more relaxed in his delivery and demeanour. I suppose he knew the end was coming and was glad to be on the loose again. Be that as it may,Season Four was as good as any. These shows stand up beautifully still,and they are a joy to watch.
Thanks to MGM,TGG and United Artists, from whence these films originally came,for preserving them and making them available for us once more. Highway Patrol brought back alot of memories of that era for me,a bit simpler in some ways to be sure,but with TV that was worth watching, FAR more than than the pap served up today. This was a family show,how many of those are there today? In this age they would have Crawford's character swearing,there would be blood  everywhere when Crawford fired his snub nosed .38,he'd be accused of being chauvinistic,and so much more. It's a different world and much to my chagrin they don't make them like Sea Hunt and Highway Patrol anymore. We may have lost something, but this shows we at least haven't lost it for good.",1397692800,8,3627,4.729857819905213
5582010,5,B00BDZV8TI,"I first saw this show on reruns on This tv  in Los Angeles
while not as accurate as ""Adam 12 "" in regard to Police procedures , what got me hooked was
the lack of music playing all the time like you have in Adam 12 or Dragnet .

In real life you don't hear a sound track playing where ever you go, and so slowly
I was getting drawn in with the natural sounds of nature and people / car sounds that you do hear in real life
you really do get a feel of what they are seeing and hearing at the time of shooting
you are there watching as it happens and feel a part of the action
its almost Zen like at times

THE  whole series of highway patrol (4 years) were just like watching the show today. clear, no skips, great sound, I own the complete series, because it was a great show. the price to own all 4 cost less then a tank of gas, and you can watch them over and over, while that tank of gas is gone by the time you get to the store.

The episode 'Transmitter Danger' is a bit out of focus in a couple of places but presumably that was the fault of the cameraman and not the transfer which is otherwise excellent.

Spot old Hollywood street locations, including Griffith Park, Hollywood Hills, many San Fernando/Santa Clarita spots, and several shows involving a plant/warehouse location is the actual old ZIV studio on Santa Monica Blvd. where the show was actually shot!

5582033,5,B00BDZV8TI,"First, let me say I am biased toward film noir-type police shows. Broderick Crawford's acting is stogy, dry and predictable--in other words, perfect for this genre. If you enjoy Dragnet then you will probably enjoy Highway Patrol even more. All four seasons are superb in both picture and sound with a couple of exceptions.

5582037,3,B00BDZV8TI,"I watched exactly half of the series, but it eventually became boring.  Also, the theme 'song' is annoying -- it's not much of a tune, and it's too loud.  I used Fast Forward to get past it most of the time.

It was very interesting to see Adam-12 district Sgt. (William Boyett) as Broderick Crawford's assistant in Highway Patrol.  He is at least 10 years younger here than he was in the Adam-12 series.",1372032000,,404,4.418918918918919
5582038,4,B00BDZV8TI,"""HIGHWAY PATROL"" is a fast-paced 'cops & robbers' show that is always a joy to watch. While this show avoids delving into deep themes, it offers terse action with splendid acting. The quality of the DVD is superb, and the price is a bargain by any measure! In addition, it is a walk down memory lane to see so many vintage cars from the late 1950's sporting their incredible designs replete with a full spectrum of 'fins'.",1371945600,8,422,4.4935064935064934

5582040,4,B00BDZV8TI,"I like the short story times; so far all of them I have watched have been thirty minutes. I like Broderick Crawford's no nonsense, tough guy persona. The motorcycles, patrol cars, helicopters, and two-way radio communication keep the action going whether the cops have to chase the bad guys or if they have to try to think like the bad guys and figure out what their next move might be. Some of the story titles are very direct: Frightened Witness, Blood Money, Framed Cop, Detour To Death.

I would recommend this collection to anyone who likes to watch classic television.

5582042,5,B00BDZV8TI,"I'm elated that Highway Patrol is finally available from the original masters. In 1998, I bought a set of videos for a family member, and we had to be satisfied just to have the shows- the picture quality was pretty poor, but that was all we could get then, collector copies.
Then in 2006, I saw HP on DVD, and sunk more money into that set. I was furious that they were just copies of what I already had-I know because I recognized the station ID's and glitches. A couple of the discs were defective, too.
Last year, ""THIS"" network started airing Highway Patrol at 5 am, and I managed to tape some episodes, but it was inconvenient to set timer, and I wanted DVDs.  It was exciting to be able to SEE everything!
I saw recently that Highway Patrol was available to manufacture on demand, but it was a bit pricey. Now this set is out, and the price was great! I don't know if the first season is available this way, it doesn't seem to be. I may even pay full price for them, because the quality is outstanding! You can see every detail, it's like watching them for the first time.
Mind you, I never saw these until I was a grown-up. But I love the show!! If you like old black and white television from the 1950's, this is for you! Broderick Crawford is great, and the plots are pretty interesting. And the locations are fun, and the old cars.
I highly recommend this to anyone who likes quality television!",1370908800,,1406,4.325757575757576

5582047,5,B00BDZV8TI,"Early TV thrived on clichs-bad guys were bad, good guys were good, and this series is about as black and white as you can get. Broderick Crawford as Highway Patrol Chief Dan Mathews is a total tough guy-he talks so fast you would swear he was still in Brooklyn. The episodes are formulaic, but ultimately satisfying, the good guys ultimately triumph, but the bad guys give it a good shot. The period American atmosphere, and the excellent voiceover make this great entertainment for nostalgia buffs, and those who want to know what it was like to live in early postwar America.  Take special note of how smoggy the landscape is, there is never a clear day in 1950's Southern California.",1369526400,2,686,4.716666666666667
5582048,5,B00BDZV8TI,"Having devoured MGMs toe dipping season one of this utterly fabulous series, Im an impatient UK fan now satisfying my withdrawal symptoms with series four from TGG Direct, though Im curious as to why the seasons are not being released in sequence. However, the sheer joy of revisiting these classic mini dramas is such a delight  and what a pristine top quality package it is!

As you Americans were tuning in to Highway Patrol in your 1950s millions, so were we here in England in our slightly less millions, at least those of us who were lucky enough to be around in those heady days of embryonic US TV. Watching Broderick Crawford and all those incredible cop cars tearing around in the dusty heat of 1950s Los Angeles was an unimaginable weekly treat for English schoolboys of the time. The series truly set the tone for all of us whose hearts were stirred by the magnetism and spirit of America. Believe me, tuning in to Highway Patrol on a rainy winters night in pre Beatles England, made LA and its sunlit ambience seem like another planet. Highway Patrol was the show that personally hooked me on Hollywood, and fired my childhood dream of having to make it there some day. Years later I did, and to this day, the shows various LA locations (though now considerably changed) have a certain surreal ring about them.

Congratulations to MGM and TGG for releasing the complete series from what is clearly first generation 35mm masters. So good is the quality, its like watching a brand new movie, and a real technical shock after having suffered the awful quality of the original transmissions. Interestingly, it appears that the 4x3 framing was shot with 16x9 in mind, as the format easily allows for blowing up to widescreen TVs with no discernable image loss.

So, once again the legendary Broderick Crawford is firing his classic one-liners at breakneck speed, and seriously looking if he could do with a stiff drink into the bargain! Please keep it coming with more series TGG  you have a ready made audience. Oh, and remember everyone, leave your blood at the Red Cross  not on the highway!

5582049,5,B00BDZV8TI,"If you enjoyed this fifties series (like I did), then you will love this one. Highway Patrol, unlike most series during this time holds up well, thanks to old Broderick Crawford, who's ugly mug was offset by casting young, handsome actors who might draw in the ladies...Stewart Whitman, Joe Patridge, William Boyett and Ron Foster, and including guest stars who were quite good, and many in early stages of their careers, such as Leonard Nimoy. It's such fun spotting them. It's also fun seeing all those classic cars, trucks, even helicopters. This comes highly recommended. 10-4.",1368662400,,581,5.0625

8566795,5,B00BDZV8TI,"Broderick Crawford; was there ever a more handsome, debonair looking Highway Patrol officer on the force (I mean on a late 50's syndicated Television show)? How about one that at the drop of a coin, syringe, or hint of corruption could transform that ""welcome home, honey"" face into a rage-a-holic fury of frightening proportions?

I know, I know, that's just my skewed view of him, and maybe it's a psychological dillemma on my part, but I'm just saying that a guy could have nightmares about him pulling you over for speeding and then going ballistic over your failure to get your license out of your wallet fast enough. That's never any fun!

Watching Broderick Crawford at a safe-distance, however, is not only intriguing, but can be unintentionally funny (to me, anyway) watching his growing impatience with those who would violate the law.

I would have loved to have had a Stanley Kubrick-directed version of Jim Thompson's ""The Killer Inside Me"" made starring Crawford as Peace Officer Lou Ford (though the original film with Stacy Keach in that role is deeply disturbing/satisfying PLUS it has Don Stroud AND Susan Tyrrell, not to mention Burt Kennedy in the director's chair, among other integrity-worthy aspects; but someone please give it a remastering effort someday soon). Unfortunately, Mr. Kubrick did not ever make such a film, and as Joe Spinell's Mom once said (to Joe, that is, but you can say it to me after all this wishing in one hand), ""you're such a dreamer"".

Wait a minute, how did I get off on that fantasy of a film-not-ever-filmed smack dab in the middle of a review of this terrific box set of Season 4 of ""Highway Patrol""? I certainly can be a dunderhead at times and that probably goes some distance at explaining how I might be terrified to have Broderick Crawford barking in my ear: ""JUST GET THE LICENSE OUT OF THE WALLET!"" as I tremble into a shivering textbook-case of anxiety personified.

39 episodes on 5 Discs and they all look great! No subtitles optioned, but the sound is loud and clear (especially when Dan Matthews aka Broderick Crawford is shouting at a criminal to slow down so he can catch him). This is a box of goodness and you want more of that in your life, I would think, but maybe not so the choice is yours. Happiness is just a shopping cart away and no traffic tickets will be issued.",1513382400,,2342,4.688564476885645
