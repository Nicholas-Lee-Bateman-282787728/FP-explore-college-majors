8300770,3,B001F2U714,This OAV isn't art by any means. To make matters worse it is an ecchi anime to top it all off.  But it does certainly give the winter months a theme.,1343692800,,149,3.806451612903226
8300771,5,B001F2U714,"I like this very much as it is a super model. Which is my type.

Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho.",1328745600,2,91,2.9565217391304346
8300772,3,B001F2U714,"It was cute. Would be willing to show it to friends. Wouldn't pay more than $5 for it though. It's a novel approach to a holiday video. The romatic aspects were done without being blatant or crass. More of an innocent than ""adult"" romance. It was amusing to see all the trouble she got him into without even trying.",1252195200,,315,4.3559322033898304
8300773,3,B001F2U714,"This isn't a series to get hooked on. Its been around a while and was pulled on initial release due to a ratings issue if I remember correctly. Unless Funimation plans to finish the series I would just watch for the first episode and see it as simply a christmas special, anime style.",1229817600,,284,4.377358490566038
