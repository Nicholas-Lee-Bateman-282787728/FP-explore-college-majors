3622806,5,B001H506YW,"This is an atmospheric drama set in the stark ruins of Berlin after World War II. It has richly nuanced characters, a tight plot  and is beautifully filmed in black and white. It is one of the few movies I saw as a child which stuck with me all these years and on seeing it again, I was just as enthralled.",1357776000,3,306,4.016393442622951
3622807,5,B001H506YW,"In this nearly forgotten masterpiece, director Carol Reed weaves a grim tapestry of the early days of ""The Cold War"". Set in postwar gutted Berlin, a young Claire Bloom flies to Berlin to visit her military/doctor brother and his German wife (Hildegarde Neff). James Mason plays Ivo, an East Berliner with a shady past. This movie is difficult to review without giving away many spoilers in the plot. Briefly, Mason seeks asylum in West Berlin. Bloom is mistaken for her sister in law and is kidnapped and taken to the Eastern sector. Mason moves in to free Bloom. The images that follow their escape are bleak; fleeing through skeletons of unfinished buildings in stark snowy weather, a brothel, a boy on a bicycle devoted to Mason who eventually is the source of his downfall, is about all I can say without giving too much away.

The gritty B&W photography against the backdrop of war-shattered Berlin and the somber musical score, perfectly set the perspective of this gloomy drama. The performances by the three leads are superb. Mason had a long and illustrious career in films. Bloom and Neff were largely overlooked by Hollywood, however; Bloom fared somewhat better. Discovered by Charlie Chaplin, she had a spotty career in films eventually finding success on the Broadway stage. She is the foremost interpreter of Shakesperian ladies. She later won acclaim as an author if two autobiographies. She lends solid support and grace to every project she is involved with. Neff was wasted by Hollywood and became a bestselling author. Reed as many already know, is an acclaimed British director.

This film is only available on Amazon Instant Video. It has never been released in Region 1 DVD, and it should be. It is a great film that deserves preservation on disc and is highly recommended.",1348704000,5,1797,4.927392739273928
3622808,4,B001H506YW,"excelled at making dark, lonely, intriguing films set amongst the ruins of Germany following WWII. This film is a little easier to follow than ""The Third Man,"" but I think it is still an interesting story. Looking at post war Germany is depressing, but from our standpoint in the 21st century, the film's locales are enlightening. Here the black and white photography shows the light and shadows of snowy Berlin in all of its rubble and decimation as a stark and dangerous place. The plot takes full advantage of the natural setting of the film, and adds to the sense of mystery and intrigue.

The story is absorbing. Claire Bloom is an innocent English girl visiting her big brother who is an army physician. He and she are both to be taken at face value, and have nothing to hide. Bloom's sister-in-law (the luminous Hildegard Neff, whose light liquid eyes are so compelling) is not so straightforward, and has at least one big secret, which Bloom suspects from the beginning. But Bloom is a well-bred girl and largely keeps her opinions to herself. Once James Mason enters the film, it is charged with the dangerous sexuality he was able to bring to his characterizations. Of course Bloom falls in love with him, but he is probably up to no good.

Reed foresees the problems between what will become East Berlin and West Berlin. Although Berlinners can still pass through the border between the Russian sector, which is liberally peppered with posters of Stalin, and the Allied sector, Reed presages the tension which will exist once the wall goes up. The escape sequence from east to west in the last half of the film is fast-paced and exciting. The question of whether Bloom and Mason can escape the repressive and fearful eastern sector makes for some thrilling cinema. Reed makes interesting use of a young German boy on a shiny bicycle throughout the movie. What should be a symbol of carefree childhood quickly becomes the herald and tool of dark eastern forces working against the innocent westerners, much like the Hitler youth turned a picture of blonde, fresh-faced youngsters into something dark and evil. Too bad the format is not for use in the USA, but TCM does show this film periodically. If you have a DVR record it. I think you will enjoy watching it.",1276387200,10,2272,4.749367088607595

I too wish that this movie were released in DVD-U.S.A. format, as it remains one of my 5 favorite movies of all times. The acting of Claire Bloom and James Mason ranks as being superb and haunting. A previous reviewer wrote that Bloom and Mason were later reunited in 1965's ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", and referenced the similarly-ending climax of both movies.  However, the star (male lead) of ""The Spy"" movie was actually Richard Burton, not James Mason.  Ironically, Burton and Bloom had once been longtime-lovers; and it was written that Elizabeth Taylor often visited ""The Spy"" set, during filming, to quietly observe her husband and Bloom.",1256169600,5,892,6.0078740157480315
3622810,4,B001H506YW,"Even years after the end of the Second World War, Berlin was a heap of ruins with a population as wrecked as the buildings.  In THE MAN BETWEEN, there is a synthesis between man and tenement that forms a background against which the protagonist Ivo Kern (James Mason) struggles mightily to regain a moral compass which he lost while committing atrocities such as in Lidice.  Ivo was reported killed in action in 1943, leaving his wife Bettina (Hildegard Neff) to mourn.  When the war ends, she goes on with her life and remarries a British army physician who brings his sister Suzanne (Claire Bloom) to visit them in East Germany.  At this point, Ivo returns literally from the dead.  Instead of Ivo's attempting to restart his marriage to Bettina, Suzanne falls for him.  THE MAN BETWEEN is far more than a love story set amidst the ruins.  It is that all right, but it is also the story of a people whose last memory of freedom ended in 1933 and twenty years later, that memory has faded.  The film is black and white and much of the scenery is shot in and around crumbling buildings.  The East Berlin police routinely check IDs of any resident.  Against this setting, Suzanne is kidnapped in error and Ivo risks his own neck to save her.  Will they both escape to the western sector?  The ending is reminiscent of a film that would later re-unite Mason and Bloom in a similar vein, THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD.  Here, Ivo is literally a man caught between two worlds, of which only one can offer the basics of human life.  THE MAN BETWEEN is a compelling reminder that such a person is often fated to go through life caught in the crosshairs of an anonymous sniper.",1251676800,3,1674,4.481848184818482
3622811,5,B001H506YW,"Great performances and direction make this an outstanding and atmospheric spy thriller, with interesting post-war Berlin locales.  James Mason plays a hardened petty criminal who ends up helping British tourist Bloom escape from behind the Iron Curtain.  Fans of The Third Man should enjoy this.  Hard to believe this is not yet available in a Region 1 format.",1232755200,4,360,5.172413793103448
3622812,5,B001H506YW,"This is truly a film like no other.
The way the story unfolds, then reverses itself and then does another ""180"" anchors you to the screen.
James Mason and Claire Bloom are magnetizing as they prove that opposites attract even under the most dire of circumstances.
I'll say no more so that Carol Reed can work his magic and let you experience this movie for yourself",1422403200,2,365,4.545454545454546
3622813,5,B001H506YW,"When reviewing ""The Man Between"", comparisons with ""The Third Man"" are inevitable. TMB features a gloomy post -WW 2 Berlin in winter, the latter an even more somber post-War Vienna.  Both movies are shot in beautiful black and white-that lost Hollywood art. Viewers of TMB should watch for two eye catchers: The first are those somber posters of Josef Stalin, Premier of Russia reminding the harried Berliners who was the Boss. The other are those deep focus camera shots.  There is always action in the background here. That must have taken deft planning on the part of Director Carol Reed, who was also at the helm for ""The Third Man"".

As TMB unfolds, a prim and proper young Brit, Claire Bloom arrives to visit her brother, stationed in Berlin. He is married to the beautiful Hildegard Neff, who does not receive enough screen time. The viewer will sense immediately that something is askew in the family.  That hinky feeling escalates when ""family friend"" James Mason is introduced to Bloom. JM is an obvious ""man with a past"". Complicating the mystery is the issue of travel between the East and West sectors. The film is set in the-pre-Wall 1950s. Exactly who can pass back and forth is never clarified in TMB. That only adds to the puzzle.

There will be no spoiler here. Previous reviews have divulged too much plot. There are some key characters this space will not mention. The curious will just have to watch the movie for themselves. What will be observed is that Bloom is mistaken for ""someone else"" (!) and kidnapped to the Eastern zone. The cipher Mason and one of the ""undivulged"" guys try to bring her back. Viewers will relish the seedy back alleys, night people and the tawdry side of industrial East Berlin. There were some dangerous neighborhoods over there. Things just went bump in the dark.

Do the good guys get out? Does anyone live happily ever after? The curious will just have to watch.

""The Man Between"" is a good one. Viewers should make every effort to follow the plot. Be ready to rewind! This viewer actually watched a second time to take in what was not so obvious at first. Those who follow ""The Man Between"" will be richly rewarded.",1422230400,,2171,4.697368421052632
3622814,4,B001H506YW,"The item arrived promptly.  The audio is slightly out of sync with the picture.  In the night scenes, the close shots of the faces are lacking some detail.  However, this is still the best transfer I've found of this film.  A pity they won't clean it up properly, as this is a film noir gem.  Ignore the critics, they got it wrong on this one.  Mason and Bloom have incredible chemistry, and he displays his best brooding, tormented persona.",1419292800,2,441,4.518987341772152
3622815,5,B001H506YW,"Don't be misled or put off by the silly poster (Terror! Vice! Violence!) This is a terrific film noire about post-war Berlin; it captures the sense of dread and paranoia that haunted Berlin as the Communists moved to strangle East Germany and turn it into a Stalinist police state. This film is a kind of sequel to the masterpiece ""The Third Man"" starring Orson Wells. James Mason is one of the great actors of all time. Brilliant acting, directing and camera work.",1415059200,5,465,4.682926829268292

8307831,4,B001H506YW,"Like another reviewer said, don't be put off by the cheesy cover art--this is a much more profound film than that silly graphic indicates.  As one who is of an age to have lived thru the entire cold war, and had relatives directly affected by it, I can say it depicts the era amazingly well.  Believe me, there is no fantasy or overkill here.  This is how a totalitarian state is, killings and all.  The oppressive atmosphere is real, as is the fear and the ever-present danger.  This movie captures it wonderfully, that mixture between normal life and total subjugation.  Live your life ""politically correct"", and you'll be fine. Yearn for freedom or individuality, and you risk death.

This film captures that aura perfectly.  The feeling of normalcy, backed against a mortal crushing if you dare step out of line. This film captures that line which divides a fine and comfortable existence, from giving your very life to achieve freedom.  James Mason is great, as always.  Claire Bloom is beautiful, and perhaps her character is overly naive, but it works.  The worldly wise vs. the blinded foolishness.  The knowing vs. the trusting.

The only thing we learn from history, is that we do not learn from history.",1520380800,,1214,4.806763285024155

8307835,3,B001H506YW,"There are obvious resemblances between this film and Reed's 'The Third Man'. The scene here is Berlin shortly after the war. The atmospheric locations add a great deal to the suspense. For two-thirds of the film, Reed holds back from the viewer an explanation for the odd goings on, after which the action suddenly heats up. James Mason is excellent as the man irredeemably damaged by his past who glimpses what might have been in the person of Claire Bloom's character. Bloom does well in her rolea female Holly Martinswithout completely convincing. I would have given this four or five stars except for a major caveat. About two-thirds the way through the film, in this transfer, there is an audible break in the sound track, after which the sound and vision are out of sync.

8307838,4,B001H506YW,"Imagine that Carol Reed remade The Third Man, this time Holly Martins and Harry Lime have been melded into one character, and that character was played by James Mason whose casting in Odd Man Out gives his character a certain pathos.  The film is The Man Between is that film, and it is not great.  Here are some of its shortcomings:  The exposition at the start of this unusually long film is particularly slow, and could easily been shortened from 25 minutes to 5.  Some shots are really great while others are badly lit.  It's hard to believe that the same cinematographer shot the entire film.  And James Mason does not manage a very good German accent, nor does he always stay in character, sometimes ending his sentences with his usual charming accent.  Moreover, his character has none of the darkness of Harry Lime.  Whatever its failings, The Man Between is well-worth watching for several reasons:  if you ever wondered if the little boy in The Third Man has something to do with he little boy in Lang's M, you were right.  There are shots in The Man Between that are direct quotations from M.  And if you thought that Welles is responsible for whatever is great about The Third Man, this film provides pretty conclusive evidence.  There is a staircase scene at night with a woman shouting at police and a car chase that includes shots of a car chase like the sequence with Martins being by a speeding taxi driver delivered to a lecture hall.  There are also close up shots of police at various Berlin checkpoints that recall the shots of police hunting down Harry Lime in the sewers.  And the last third of the film makes use of lots of Expressionist / Noir shots with canted angles.  But The Man Between is just not a formally accomplished film, especially when compared to the genius work of The Third Man.  But here are some more reasons to see the film:  a lot of it was shot in Berlin in 1953.  The cityscape is far more ravaged than the Vienna of The Third Man.  I lived in Berlin in 1994-96, so this footage had a special interest to me.  But it really is eye-opening if you lived through the Cold War.  There's even a sequence with Checkpoint Charlie before it became what it was in 1960 when the Berlin Wall wall went up (and shot in The Spy Who Came In from the Cold).  The only other films I know of that were shot in Berlin (partly) before the Wall went up are Billy Wilder's One, Two, Three and Jacques Tourneur's Berlin Express.  Neither film shows the devastation of Berlin as fully or effectively.  Claire Bloom fans will enjoy her performance, but her character his very monochrome.",1429747200,,2610,4.515991471215352
