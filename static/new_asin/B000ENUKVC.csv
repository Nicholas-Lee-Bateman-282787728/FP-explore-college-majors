8111861,4,B000ENUKVC,"Great product for its price,  fast shipping.  The only problem I had,  was that the case was dented.  :(",1414281600,,104,4.315789473684211
8111862,5,B000ENUKVC,"I got it soooooo cheap and in pristine condition. The cd is worth it. 20 something songs, mostly just background themes and of course the fact that it's a collectible makes it cool. This seems to be the cheapest one but get it anyway. It's cheap!",1366588800,,246,4.369565217391305
8111863,5,B000ENUKVC,"My fellow Hagaren-nutcases: I was confused about these tin collectible boxes and what was actually inside them. I purchased this red box on Amazon, using this product link. At $8.97, down from its $45 retail price, I was sceptical about what I was going to get. Well, I got a shrink-wrapped, brand new metal box, unopened. Inside was 1 DVD, vol. 10 and 1 CD, Soundtrack 3. Seems like new tins come that way.  Inside the DVD there is a glossy colorful booklet full of your fav. Hagaren art. The idea is that this tin is half-empty for you to collect the other episodes. As all Hagaren addicts know, there are 3 tins in all. The other tins (black, white) seem kinda expensive compared to this red one. I suppose it's because I came late in the collectible game. Anyway, if you can get any one of them for cheap, do it. It's really cool!",1328227200,,834,4.380645161290323
8111864,5,B000ENUKVC,"I believe that the last few disks in this series are the most interesting and exciting episodes of the series. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the series as a whole, but if you can only afford one box set - then this is the one you want. The tin is colorful and durable; the dvd is the top quality that you would expect from FMA, and the soundtrack that is also included has some of my most favorite songs from the series on it. Absolute must-have for true fans of FMA.",1170633600,2,464,4.054347826086956
8111865,5,B000ENUKVC,"Yo I have the FMA Movie Boxset!

 It is definitely a HUGE HIT!!

This movie goes into a lot of historical detail...

and even mentions famous characters

Like acclaimed director Fritz Lang - (Metropolis and others)

this movie takes place right around the end of WWI, and mentions the putsch, treaty of versailles, ETC. I took ap US history, so that is what made this movie

all the more enjoyable....

(although i did not like the course as much, bc memorizing all the stuff

was hard)

any way sorry amazon, but i need to inform the general public about this

wonderful movie, good luck to all of you who are trying to obtain a copy of it)

Now for this Dvd, i am not so sure what happens, so i cannot review for it that is all.... I do hope that I convinced everybody here to pursue the

movie though........",1148256000,3,811,4.326666666666667

8111868,5,B000ENUKVC,"You know, the TV series on Cartoon Network must be near the end of the series by now, and the DVD release pattern only takes us so far, getting 4 episodes every 3 months.

At this rate, I hope they release the series on DVD before they release the movie, since I don't have cable.",1142640000,,280,4.090909090909091
