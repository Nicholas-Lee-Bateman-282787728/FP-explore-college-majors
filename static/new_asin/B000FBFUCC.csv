8120253,5,B000FBFUCC,I remember viewing this documentary when it frist came out on television. I was so impressed with its 'spookyness' and authenticity'; the late Peter Graves covered the real story and facts surrounding the origins of your typical Halloween ghouls! The use of horror movie highlights and background music made the documentary all the more realistically scary! I was surprised that it had been rerecorded on DVD and bought it!,1288483200,,423,5.144927536231884
8120254,5,B000FBFUCC,"I think this is a great doucumentary. Some reasons why I think this is because it names all the facts about witches werewolves and vampires. It interviews people about each subject and how witches are are not real  how vampires are reals are not real, and how werewolves are are not real. It also shows how witches, werewolves and vampires could have been real in certain places our how people could be witches werewolves and vampires. In conculsion if you into a doucumentary thats is half scary and good for bedtime I'd suggest this to you. If your into a doucumentary about your favorite person our place I woud not suggest this to you.",1103932800,,639,4.605263157894737
