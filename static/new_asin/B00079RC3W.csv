8046363,3,B00079RC3W,"This DVD contains 4 short films.

The first film, DEBS, is about 7 minutes long and was the most entertaining of the bunch  (two very gorgeous girls making out in the middle of a gun fight between the goodies and the baddies).

The middle two films left me cold.  One short was about a lesbian couple who goes to visit one of the partners sister who is transgendering into the man.  Amanda Bearse (sp?) plays the sister who is a furious bitch to her tranny sister.  This film was a major downer and I didn't see the point of it.

The third film was about a little girl who wants to fly and lives with her trailer trash mom and older sister. The girl is basically ignored unless she does something wrong. She runs away to a neighboror who everyone thinks is freak and they have a brief but touching discussion.  I didn't see what this film had to do with lesbians and I was very disappointed because of this fact.

The fourth short film is a series of scenes taken from about a dozen famous films but with a gay spin (example: From Here to Eternity has two women making out a beach, Casablanca has Rick saying goodbye to his very femmy boyfriend, Young Frankenstein has a big gay monster doing it to the effeminate guy in the hay loft and so on.) Most of these short movie scenes were very enjoyable.

What I object to regarding this DVD is that it did not have a lot of lesbians and/or lesbian action, and/or the films were depressing.  This DVD was not worth $25 but would be worth renting at Netflicks since you can bet your sweet bippy this DVD ain't ever going to show up at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.",1116892800,17,1610,4.3156146179401995
8046364,5,B00079RC3W,All four of the short films have something very special to offer the L&G community.  D.E.B.S is s super funny and sexy parody of high school spies where one has something to hide.  Give or Take an Inch gives a touching look behind the repercussions of a sex change.  Fly Cherry is a poignant look into the lives of two very different women and a connection they share.  Finally is a great take on classic films with a L&G twist.  Hilarious and thought provoking!,1104451200,5,462,4.4523809523809526
