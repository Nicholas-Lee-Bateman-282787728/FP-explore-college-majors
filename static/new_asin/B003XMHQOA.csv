8408364,1,B003XMHQOA,This has nothing to do with money.  It is a waste of time and one of the most boring DVD's I have ever seen.,1411516800,,108,3.5
8408365,5,B003XMHQOA,"Expressed in the words of the investors, bankers, and manufacturers taking advantage of the ""free trade"" agreements that were passed, and continue to be passed, in secrecy behind closed doors by bought and paid for politicians for the benefit of their corporate bank rollers, this documentary provides an honest insight into the consequences on the working population and the increasingly toxic, and in many cases, cancerous, environment.",1392508800,2,438,5.552238805970149
8408366,5,B003XMHQOA,"This is a film on the facts of the world financial system, often expressed in the words of its financial participants...in other words, in their OWN WORDS. What it says about the high capitalism of our times...free as it is from any constraints, moral or otherwise...is a message not to be forgotten. Such telling financial decisions were mostly done ""out of sight and out of mind"" of the world's citizens....Most of us came to know them only by their consequences

If you like the thinking and humanity of Francis, then you should see this DVD, as it creates the factual groundwork for understanding of reality as it happened...and as it still is.",1388707200,,648,4.785714285714286

Greed is Good.",1386547200,,113,4.7
8408368,1,B003XMHQOA,"Incredibly slanted and misleading.  Most of the movie is just images designed to push the viewer to a certain conclusion, seemingly that privatization and capitalism are bad, and socialism is good.  There isn't really any argument made with facts or logic to support this conclusion, except that there are still poor people with capitalism in place, as if there are 0 poor under a socialist regime.",1356652800,2,398,5.015151515151516
