When I was little, I didn't really care what I was watching. I'm almost 18 and I recently found this in my basement. I tested it to see if it still worked it does, but it was so cheesy and the kids looked ready for a nap.",1523491200,,404,4.0

All of the other negative reviews were correct. This was a complete waste of my money and my family's time. I fast forwarded through most of it looking for a scene where the kids in the video don't have a confused ""Why are you shoving a camera in my face"" look on their faces. There were none. The music was horrible and it didn't even match up with what the kids were doing in each scene. I would much rather sit through all of Baby Geniuses (commonly referred to  one of the 10 Worst Movies of All Time next to Grease 2 and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within) than watch another moment of this complete waste of 30 minutes worth of VHS tape.

Once it was finally over, I didn't even bother rewinding it. I am now destroying the tape and shredding the box it came in. To me it was worth a few bucks to remove such an evil thing from the face of the Earth. I only hope the children involved in its production were not scarred for life by their idiot parents who somehow agreed to let them pose for the camera people from Sony Wonder, an unfortunate subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment which is strange because I was not entertained. Sickened yes, definately sickened, but certainly not entertained.",1091836800,2,1252,4.387931034482759
