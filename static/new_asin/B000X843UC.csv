2998772,5,B000X843UC,"This has got to be one of the funniest TV shows I've watched this year. Whether you work in the IT industry or not, you will laugh. Watch out for the homage to old computer games in the title credits.
Its worth buying a cheap all region player to view such funny shows.",1198281600,13,269,4.09433962264151
2998773,5,B000X843UC,"It's absolutely horrible this is only available as a Region 2 DVD, because this show is hilarious.  There are only 6 episodes in this season, but each one is as funny as the next.

Even if you're not a fan of British comedies, you should check this out.  I'd like to get a region free DVD player just so I can own this DVD, but until then I'll settle for what I can find on Youtube.",1194912000,13,382,4.0
2998774,5,B000X843UC,"The IT crowd is a clever and hilarious satire of the everyday struggles of a brilliant mind trapped in an office of those who think computers run on magic and faerie dust.
This British sitcom follows the lives of the three protagonists who make up the IT department of a generic ""runs everything and has tones of money"" corporation. Their varying levels of nerdness ensures that everyone in the audience has someone to relate to. I'm a Jen, with a little bit of Roy mixed in. The intelligent and quick-witted writing is my favorite part but there a good level of visual humor as well.
This show is the perfect addition to the DVD library of any techie/programmer/software engineer/anyone who has ever had to utter the phrase ""have you tried switching it off and on again.""",1490227200,3,772,4.6838235294117645

2998778,5,B000X843UC,"Absolutely hilarious! I can't understand why this show didn't have a much longer run; it's brilliant! A great blend of broad, physical-type comedy (think Benny Hill!) and a more cerebral type of humor, for those who actually do enjoy thinking on occasion. Like all good comedies, it's funny simply because it has a solid foundation in truth and reality. (Anybody who's ever worked in an IT-support position should definitely enjoy this show very much!)

It makes fun of all things computers and the eccentrics that seem to inhabit that world. The characters make for some great comedy situations and theres several big laughs per episode.

2998795,1,B000X843UC,"British sitcoms tend to be ""overacted"" and sometimes this adds to the humor. In this case however; it only highlights how poor the humor is an how bad the actors are.

I'm a little iffy on Parkinson, although she is fine in small doses. I felt the same way on her tenure with Doc Martin. And I prefer Chris Martin's Denholm Reynholm to Matt Berry's Douglas Reynholm but that is but a minor annoyance. The only problem I have is with that damn laugh-track! JEEEZZZUUUSSS! When are studios/producers going to stop with that nonsense. After awhile all I can hear is the damn noise of that canned laughter (whether in studio or from people long dead recorded years and year ago). And more annoyingly are the times when the fake laughter drowns out the dialogue. Jeezzuuss! Enough already!",1472169600,,734,4.653846153846154

2998830,4,B000X843UC,"Sit-coms are sit-coms. So, in this day and age, you really need to be inventive to rise above the fray. This one does it in spades.

Here's the scoop. Two nerdy, socially inept, I.T. guys (Chris O'Dowd and Richard Ayoade) work in a cluttered office in the basement of a large corporation. A new, female supervisor (Katherine Parkinson) is assigned to oversee them and she knows zero about computers. So the three find themselves together trying to navigate the complexities of corporate environment, as well as the outside world itself, with varying degrees of success.

This is a real hoot. The three main characters are all something to behold. Each is drawn very well and as funny as all get out. As good as O'Dowd is, Richard Ayoade really shines. Between his immense eyeglass frames, odd hairstyle and peculiar twitchiness he really draws your attention. I've seen Katherine Parkinson in a few more serious roles so it's good to see her stretch her comic muscles. She also does a sweet job. This is not unlike ""Seinfeld"" in that you have this oddball group of characters that can only be with each other. They are too at odds with the ""real"" world. Also is the fact that the writing will introduce some seemingly insignificant something early on in the story that ends up rearing its ugly head later on.

The series sported a handful of writers/directors with Graham Linehan shouldering the lion's share. He must be one weird dude because there is such a peculiar posture on everything that it stands out from any sit-com you've ever seen.

If you like your comedies weird and left of center, this should do you well.",1441411200,,1622,4.74113475177305

2998836,5,B000X843UC,"A fantastic series! The writing is top-notch, the characters are absolutely perfect, and the actors portraying them cannot be matched. If you like British humour, witty banter, and also believe people to be a bunch of bastards, then look no further.",1433894400,,249,5.097560975609756
2998837,2,B000X843UC,"This comedy is mostly slapstick (I have only seen the first two episodes; I may not watch any more of them).

To give you an example, the office manager really, really likes a pair of red high heeled shoes.  Well, she wear a size 8 or so, these are a size 5; so she goes to the store and begs the shoes sales person to put these shoes on her.  Maybe a minute is spend on trying to fit shoes that are far too small on her, with a surfeit of canned laughter (just in case you did not realize that this is the funny part).  She can barely walk in them.  We see her struggle to walk.  More canned laughter.  She takes the shoes off, and her toes are twisted.  More canned laughter.

Now, sometimes slapstick comedy is good for your 8 or 10 year old; and maybe you watch some shows with your children which are not that funny but they think they are funny.  However, the language here is strong at times (the F word is used); and although there is no nudity (so far), there are some sexual situations which I would not expose my child to.

Maybe these shows will get better, but as of show #2, I recommend against this unless you like slapstick humor (as I have described).  So far in the first two episodes, slapstick humor and over-broad characters makes up ALL of the humor in this show.  Brits are sometimes known for some of the clever things that they say--but not so far in this show.",1433721600,,1386,4.184905660377359

2998839,1,B000X843UC,I turned this off when the laugh-track started up. I wasn't able to concentrate upon the dialog with the tension of waiting for the next burst of canned laughter to erupt.

2998840,2,B000X843UC,I heard rave reviews about this show but so far it just seems silly and pointless.  I felt dumb for watching it.  Time to go watch some James Burke so I can gain back those IQ points I just lost.,1430179200,,195,3.85

Every time I get together with my siblings (who are spread out from Boston to San Francisco) we relive moments from the show -- it's become a family tradition. OK, full disclosure, the show hits its prime in season 3, but that season deserves many more than five stars. The one thing that can put off US viewers is sound of the live audience.

In only 3 seasons, they produced so many hysterical quotes and jokes, that it is embarrassing for other series like Big Bang Theory, or Friends, that are good, but could not keep up with such joke density and quality. The quality is very homogeneous between episodes. Humor is most frequently based on absurd situations that actually look like real life / real company. A must see!",1421107200,2,460,4.679012345679013

Not being a total nerd or any part of a need wouldn't make any different to your viewing pleasure.  This is funny stuff that isn't pigeonholed by IT 'genre'.  The cast, as very small one indeed, works very well together.  The comedy ranges from slapstick and farcical to outright IT gags and jokes.

The skits are silly, clever, extremely funny, and it is impossible not to laugh out loud ! Everyone plays a perfect role; but, i particularly liked Jen who really is the catalyst to bring it all together. The fact that each episode is realtively short certainly enhanced the fast moving pace of this series. Each episode got funnier and funnier and while the characters personality and predictability came through, this only enhanced the humor in each of the episodes. Unlike some series comedies where one joke is bent to the point of nausea, each of these episodes had new materiel that continued to surprise and entertain ! This was an after dinner entertainment for several days. I can't say enough good things about the series, it was fabulous !

2998883,5,B000X843UC,"Seriously, It happened to me during episode 5. Peeing on yourself laughing is also a strong possibility, Be warned.

This show is totally insane, quirky,  batty and loopy, and yet somehow manages to nail so deftly how people behave towards each other in a work place. It could and should have been a bigger hit than the ""OFFICE"" and in my opinion is much funnier. One might say this is how the ""Office"" might have looked like if Monty Payton were writing it while using heavily.
It follows 2 socially awkward IT techs in a big corporate - Roy and Moss, and their newly appointed head of IT department, Jen. As Jen's knowledge in all matters ""computery"" does not go beyond email sending and mouse clicking, it is soon settled that she will act as the ""relationship manager"" and strive to better Roy's and Moss' social status ( lower than that of the rabid toilet cleaners) among other employees of Reynholm industries.
It's certainly not just for nerds or computer savvy people - though it does have some jokes intended for that crowd. The show will tackle a bunch of intriguing topics  such as office dating, synchronized menstrual cycles, cannibalism, women shoe obsession and much much more, as well as the incredibly popular and yet so mysterious term IT- and what the hell that stands for.

The first Episode or two might be a bit too weird and crazy for the novice watcher to enjoy thoroughly, but as you get the hang of it you'll be hooked, guaranteed.
I've watched all 4 seasons in a heart beat, and my only complaint is that I wish there were more. And it's streamed on Netflix too.",1394496000,,1590,4.588028169014085

As we all know - a reboot will fix about anything !  But I digress....  BUY THE IT CROWD  - because you will love it.  I have all of the seasons on DVD even though they are also showing on Netflix.

The socially awkward Moss and Roy can't really relate to anyone else that works in the conglomerate business that employs them.  Jenn becomes head of the IT Department to due lies on her CV.  She may not know anything about computers but she can help the nerds better relate to the rest of the world.  This show is corny but I find it to be hilarious.,1385424000,,508,4.3052631578947365

It is VERY British, so if you don't like Monty Python (Heretic!), the U.K. version of The Office, or British humor in general, you won't like this. I, however, do, on all accounts. Good fun, silliness and general mayhem. Give it a try.",1373846400,,370,4.3
2998900,2,B000X843UC,"I generally like British comedy, but this show falls flat for me.

The show feels like the writers 5 minute script and stretched to fit a 24 minute time block. Some of the jokes were amusing, but most just felt really forced; and, despite what the title of the show may suggest, there is very minimal nerd or tech humor, with ""Have you tried turning it off and on again"" being pretty much the nerdiest joke of the show. Additionally, the main characters are, for the most part, not very likeable at all, although Maurice does occasionally have his moments.",1372291200,,556,4.56
2998901,2,B000X843UC,"Pretty much typical of what is passed off for comedy these days. I watched the first episode and thought it was silly, but bearable with promise. Most first episodes of even the great comedies such as Andy Griffith, The Beverly Hillbillies, Dick Van Dyke, and Lucy were fairly silly at first but they seem to 'find themselves' and settle down to entertaining, somewhat believable, great comedy that ran for years. These programs presented an element that most viewers could relate to or with a little imagination, find themselves. 'I T' probably could have made it passed the second episode and beyond on my TV had it not sunk into the pit of gratuitous profanity. Somehow, these small minded writers and actors today seem to feel that if they put profanity and sex in, that will seal the deal on the making of a good comedy. Not so! It simply demonstrates a lack of imagination with no sense of morality in an attempt to drag the viewer down into their pit of deprivation.",1371945600,,973,4.662790697674419

It's about the IT department in a large corporation. The two IT workers are Moss and Roy, and they are managed by Jen who knows nothing of the tech world.

2998917,5,B000X843UC,"I decided to catch this show on Netflix based on the great performances of two actors in REALLY bad American films (Ayoade in ""The Watch"" and O'Dowd in ""Bridesmaids""). As bad as those two films were (IMO), I thought they stood out and had not heard of them doing a show together...particularly one this funny!!

From the cheesy 8 bit graphics of the opening credits, to the set design (a geek/technofile's dream if you really pay very close attention to the items laying about their basement office), this is easily one of my favorite BritComs (next to SPACED that is). Although it pre-dates ""Big Bang Theory"" by a year, if you are a fan of ""BBT"", you simply must check out The IT Crowd. Moreso if you miss how funny ""Big Bang"" USED to be before they ""jumped the shark"" or ""nuked the fridge"" in season four.

The more I go back and watch these episodes (bought all four seasons since Netflix no longer streams the show), the more I even pick up similarities to a little show called ""Seinfeld"". Now...before you Seinfeld fanatics seek to berate me with your scorn, think about it. Seinfeld was really the first show on TV that truly perfected the method of finding insanity in the mundane. I find this show, on several occasions, manages to put incredibly mundane situations into the realm of absurdity.

In short...I can't recommend this show enough!",1358294400,7,1350,4.663865546218488

He knew they must be from me because we watched some episodes at my house when he was visiting.  His internet connection is not sufficient for streaming video through Netflix or any other online service, thus the reason I purchased the DVD's.

Well, I'm def not an IT or computer person(& to my knowledge have never been called a nerd but that could possibly be b/c I model & most ppl think we're dumb lol). Anyway, my point is...this show is for everyone. it's the funniest thing I've seen in yrs, possibly my favortite comedy ever. I stumbled upon it by accident when I spent the weekend at my cousin's & they had no cable, we could only watch DVD's. This was already in theirs & they put it on for me. I'm very weary about new shows & didn't really think I'd like it. Well ""egg & my face were in allignment"" LOL(sorry, inside joke, you need to get the DVD's to find out what I'm referring to). I literally wanted to watch it the entire weekend. I came home & ordered every one of the 4 series. I still think the first season may have been the best but they're all hysterical, trust me,I've seen many of the episodes numerous times & never stop laughing. The only thing about this DVd in particular are the extras aren't great. There's no commentary by Graham Linehan(the writer, sorry if I've butchered his name) which is odd b.c in series 2, he does do commentary & refers back often to commentary he did on series 1 so they must've just not put it in.

I laughed out loud the whole time - you will, too! :-)",1323475200,,341,4.296875

2998952,4,B000X843UC,"Typical English comedy: random and unpredictable, but intelligent and well-timed. The three leads interact well and the supporting cast features short appearances by some great English comedians. Combines a bit of Dilbert office humor with dork jokes and the hilarious pathos of a normal ""career-minded"" woman trying to make something of her department of two misfits.",1320710400,,368,5.589285714285714
2998953,5,B000X843UC,"I was sad when Black Books was cancelled too soon, but was happy that the co-creator decided to roll out a new show.  I have now seen seasons 1 through 4 of the IT Crowd, and I have to say that I like it as much as Black Books, though it is a different setting.

The series starts brilliantly and we are introduced to Moss and Roy, two deadbeat IT guys confined to the basement in the high rise of a prominent multi-national corporation. They are joined by Jen, an unwitting hire who knows nothing of computers but is committed to hiding this fact from everyone.

Needless to say, the show has some hilarious moments.  I found myself laughing out loud many times.  I even want to answer the phone at work ""... did you try turning it off and on again?""  The humor is similar to Father Ted and Black Books, rather dry and clever.  The actors are wonderful and especially Richard Ayoade is fantastic at bringing out audience laughter with just an expression.

I won't go into details with the individual plots or episodes.  I also peeked around at the extra features of the discs, some are fun.  The out takes are really a nice feature.

My recommendation is to watch this if you like subtle yet laugh out loud humor in that wonderful, understated British style.",1318982400,3,1259,4.454148471615721
2998954,5,B000X843UC,I recently purchased this and have only watched the first three episodes but I had to post a review saying I love this show. I guess its American counterpart is The Big Bang Theory. The IT Crowd is the funnier of the two - the characters are more developed and the plots more creative/unique. The show also has a lot of that British deadpan humor and the actors carry it off with great timing. I ended up buying all 4 seasons and am looking forward to watching the rest of the episodes.  The series gets a big thumbs up from me.,1317772800,3,528,4.227722772277228

2998956,5,B000X843UC,"This is for you if: you love British sitcoms, find humor in awkward situations, of if you enjoy workplace humor.

Although the IT Crowd is based around the working relationship of a company's IT Department, it is in no way limited to appealing only to ""techies."" The IT Crowd will be appealing to anyone who loves British sitcoms, office humor, or the sometimes awkward but always funny situational humor.

Roy and Moss, two IT experts, meet their new department head, Jen, and quickly learn that she has exactly zero computer knowledge. Instead, she aims to transform the IT Department from overlooked and ignored to a respected part of the company. However, Jen is overwhelmed by the troubles and traps Roy and Moss fall into and an overzealous boss more interested in Jen than productivity.

I was hesitant after the first episode, but gave it another chance a couple months later and found a jewel in the rough!  O, how i love thee, IT CROWD!  Funny, but some of my favorite TV shows and movies are ones that I disliked at first viewing.  Anywho, IT CROWD had me bursting with laughter from season 1 all the way through season 4!

An example of GOOD BRITCOMS:  One Foot in the Grave; Jonathan Creek, Cracker; As Time Goes By; Hetty Wainthrop Investigates (mysteries), etc.  BAD BRITCOMS:  Benny Hill, etc.  You decide.

Too bad, because the premise of this show could have been funny, entertaining, and made for great tv.  Pretty much the only funny thing is everytime their phone rings they answer by saying IT Dept ... have you tried turning on or shutting off your computer?  The odd guy with the glasses could have been an awesome character.  If this series is a spoof, I get it, but it's not a very good one.",1295568000,3,743,4.603053435114504
2998963,5,B000X843UC,"What a joy to find another 5 star BBC comedy.
It may take a few episodes to get in and stay in the groove of this brilliant BBC comedy series , well worth the effort. The humor follows closely in the way of Father Ted ,and Black Books.
Well written , Well Directed , and well acted.
The IT crowd revolves around two geeks and thier clueless Dept head who make up the IT Department of the vast Reynholm Industries  with profits of "" eighteen hundred billion billion"" for part of the year as company owner dimwitted son of founder puts it..
The IT dept. is tucked way down deep in the subterranean bowels of Reynholm Industries huge skyscraper in central London The show also features the inept Douglas Reynholm son of the founder of Reynholm Industries who now runs the Corp. with little idea of what he is doing
He hires a head of the IT dept. Jen who knows absolutely nothing about IT including what IT stands for .She is out to make her mark in the company and now oversees Moss and Roy the two geeks who are the IT dept.
happy to be out of sight and out of mind in the depths of the company they have little patience for being disturbed ""hello IT dept. have you tried turning it off and on"" is a running gag for the calls of distress. The show is absurd and funny ! and plays out like it could well have been the product of a very funny Monty Python sketch
Moss  has a bit of an edge over Roy in so far as at least knowing whats going on socially where Roy is like a new born babe and has little clue of anything outside of the nerdy side of life.
Jens social life is a mess as she often regrettably turns to Roy and Moss for help
inside the company and out this make for some wonderfully comic adventures .
The episodes quite often have that ability to build up a comedic head of steam picking up more and more laughs as the episode rolls along.
maybe one of the funniest episodes I have seen of any show, is episode 1 of season 2 titled ""work outing "" this starts out funny and builds as  the laughs get bigger and bigger, beautifully done, the direction is perfection as is the acting and writing.
but start at the very beginning season 1 become familiar with the characters it is an investment that will pay big dividends in laughs.
My wife and I went through the first 4 seasons very quickly, There are in total for four seasons a treasured 24 episodes we look forward to season 5 .I hope this review will help if you happen to be sitting on the fence
go for it ! A very well done show it has won several awards among them
BAFTA British Academy of film and Television Arts
an international Emmy. In 2006 voted Best new comedy 1st year. second year won best overall comedy it has posted several additional awards  I think the list would match the review in length but the awards show the broad range of talent Acting , Writing ,etc.

The IT Crowd is none of those things... quirky yes, and typically British dry humor in many cases but very funny with likable characters.  The opening shot of Denholm in the first episode was very reminiscent of Monty Python and from there I was hooked.  Highly recommended!",1292112000,3,392,4.82089552238806
2998966,5,B000X843UC,"I love this show. A friend of mine turned me onto it and i was REALLY excited to find it on Amazon at a decent price. Its clever and rather satirical. I tend to have an affinity for British television and this is perfect.

The characters fit their stereotype without slapping you in the face with it.
The actors have fantastic chemistry and are utterly brilliant.
The scripts are clever, well written, and filled with amazing one liners.

There is a little bit of what some would consider ""inappropriate"" content so if you're concerned about that you might want to look it up on a few sites to see if its something that would bother you. Personally I think its fine.

I would recommend this show to just about anyone.",1288483200,,717,4.5
2998967,4,B000X843UC,"Not much on the DVD if that's what you're hoping for. A few extras but I just love the show so didn't care about the extras.

2998968,5,B000X843UC,"This Brit comedy is far from your normal sitcom. It follows 3 not so cool friends as they work in Reynholm Industries in the IT department. If you think it is anything like The Office your wrong. I personally am not a fan of The Office whereas this series I cant get enough of. The three main characters are all very funny in their own ways and they all make the show what it is. Roy is the Irishman that is lazy and has an eye for the ladies and some mischief. His facial expressions make me crack up and he is full of dull enthusiasm and sarcasm. Moss is the quintessntial nerd; he lives with his mum, wears his pants too high and loves computers. His shyness and question-everything ways are very lovable and entertaining, and he is sure to make you smile. Jen is the lady of IT and in charge of the boys. She knows nothing about computers but got stuck in the department because of bogus claims she made about her skills. She is the most normal of all the characters and the biggest ""people-person"", also the most enjoyable one to look at. While maybe not as funny as the others, she is still an essential part of the show providing a more professional presence in the department and is very easy to like.

Overall the cast is wacky and the humor is shoot-from-the-hip, it may not be for everyone but if you like something thats not so mainstream and is belly-laugh funny then the adventures of the IT Crowd are for you. I own all the seasons and am pumped for the 4th!!",1287187200,,1474,4.302158273381295
2998969,5,B000X843UC,"I love, love, LOVE British comedies. I also love geeky humor. I think that's why I picked this series up. I haven't been disappointed by it so far.

The IT Crowd follows the three people in the IT department. Only two of them know what they're doing as Jen (their new manager) was plopped down in their department with absolutely no idea of how to do the job. However the other two are completely socially inept to the point where almost everyone else in the building despises them. Because of that Jen has to routinely run interference between her co-workers & everyone else in the building.

This show is brilliant. Not only does this have some FANTASTIC acting & endearing characters but it also manages to hit most of my geeky nerves pretty well. It's very quickly turning into one of my absolutely favorite series out there & if you like stuff like ""The Office"" then you're going to absolutely love this show. I really can't say who I love in the show more- Roy, Moss, or Richmond. Everyone does a fantastic job of playing off of each other so well!

Seriously, give this show a chance. It's worth watching again & again. Especially the season finale- no spoilers, but if you don't laugh at least once or twice during the episode then your funnybone must be dead.",1284163200,,1268,4.552631578947368

This is a must see for anyone--especially if you work in IT!,1282867200,,342,4.2
2998971,5,B000X843UC,"This is another great BAFTA and EMMY award-winning comedy from Graham Linehan who was one of the creators of 'Father Ted'. Like Father Ted this show  takes a bland sounding sitcom setup (a woman who knows very little about computers bluffs her way into a job overseeing the two-man IT department) and turns it into a surreal masterpiece.  Any character is likely to go over-the-top at any moment and some of  the imagery is ridiculously hilarious.  Chris O'Dowd plays lazy IT guy Roy who manages to seriously (and bloodily) injure himself in nearly every episode and Richard Ayoade plays the childlike and literal minded IT genius who e-mails about a fire in the office rather than phoning the Fire Dept.  Katherine Parkinson plays their supervisor Jen who initially seems to be the most ""normal"" character but soon becomes involved in idiocy of her own making. Describing the show doesn't do justice to it.

I ordered the MPI Home Video release listed here, and was disappointed to see that this dual-layer DVD was only filled to 5.5GB.  That's 2.5 hours of episodes plus about 30 minutes of special features compressed to 5.5GB.

I can understand the desire to fit 6 episodes on one disc.  But they could have gone a lot higher on the quality scale - the disc is already dual-layer.

2998978,4,B000X843UC,"I watched the first 2 seasons of this show, as I am a fan of British comedy, mainly in the type of shows Ricky Gervais has done, but I also watched many before he came along. When watching the first episode, all I could think about was that this was exactly the type of sitcom Gervais was making fun of with his ""when the whistle blows"" show within a show of the Extras. It so closely resembled that satire that it was not that funny, and the laugh track was annoying and insulting. The running gag of ""did you turn it off and on again"" wears thin very quickly. The female manager's foghorn angry voice is not funny-being the loudest doesn't make what you say any more clever. I wanted to give it more of a chance than making a judgement after 23 minutes, so I watched the rest of the first 2 seasons. By the third or fourth show of the first season it was getting much better, and by season 2 I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times during each show. Like most shows, it seems to take a while for the actors to get comfortable in their characters and add some depth to them. They did drop some things that didn't work that well in season 1, like the over the top cartoonish boss and the squalor of their office. And the Goth in the closet was toned down a bit as well.

The dialog is bland, stilted and wooden. The stereotypes are very one dimensional. The attempts at humor are more than not funny, they are painful!

Just for some background, I am a huge fan of the British version of The Office and of Extras. I absolutely get and enjoy well done British humor.

2998990,5,B000X843UC,"Disclaimer:  I like British Comedy.  I was six years old when I first started watching Monty Python, staying up late and sneaking on the old B/W TV while my parents slept.  My sister and I would fake coughing fits while turning the old-fashioned knob  so that they wouldn't hear the clunking sound as we passed the channels.  I soon segue wayed into The Goodies, Alas Smith and Jones, The Fall and Rise of Reginal Perrin, that guy who would end his show with ""Good night, and may your god be with you"" (remember, I was a mere kiddiewinkie; you can't expect me to remember EVERYTHING), and of course later there was Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxies, The Young Ones and then The Office.  Benny Hill was never attractive and I just couldn't get into Red Dwarf or League of Gentlemen.
When I first read about The IT Crowd, I hoped it would be worthy of my fannaticism.  Would it make me laugh out loud? chortle? guffaw? or just titter?  The first episode was giggle-worthy in a few spots, but by the end of the second episode I was beginning to worry that I was disturbing the neighbors.  As the last episode unfolded (yeah, I watched the entire first series in one night) I accepted that I had another show to add to my favorites.
The IT Crowd is about a computer tech crew.  They are nerds.  They are socially awkward.  They are neglected by the rest of the staff.  They get into embarrassing situations.  It is hysterical.  Watch The IT Crowd.",1252713600,4,1443,4.475095785440613

2998993,4,B000X843UC,"Take two hopeless I.T. nerds (one a slob and one a bespectacled social misfit), and add one pathologically lying people expert.

That's the setup for ""The IT Crowd,"" a fun little workplace sitcom that sits on the other end of the comedy spectrum from ""The Office"" -- in particular, hardcore farce. The first season is six episodes of pure weirdness and mild surreality, mostly focusing on desk rabbits, corporate goths, disastrous dates, too-small shoes, Aunt Irma and the occasional desk fire.

As the story begins, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) is hired by the deranged CEO Dernholm, whom she has told that she knows plenty about computers. Unfortunately, he doesn't plan to have her working on the levels that are full of ""lots of sexy people, not doing much work, and having affairs.""

So he sends her down to the I.T. department, a filthy basement occupied only with ""standard nerds"" -- an embittered slob named Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and socially oblivious Moss (Richard Ayoade). Despite the fact that they keep the company from imploding, nobody appreciates them (""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""). Initially the guys loathe Jen and vice versa, but gradually they start to appreciate one another.

But that doesn't stop the weird plots that ensue, obviously: Roy disrupts an anti-stress seminar while Jen grapples with foot-deforming shoes (think reverse childbirth). The arrival of Jen's ""Aunt Irma"" causes the geeks to have PMS. A disastrous date causes Roy to try to prove that women love jerks, and Jen's crush on a security guard goes horribly awry when he uses her as his lifeline on ""Do You Want To Be A Millionaire?""

Even stranger, the boys forbid Jen from opening The Red Door, but when Roy is trapped under a woman's desk Jen opens it and unleashes the gloomy horror within. And when Jen tries to avoid an obnoxious date, Moss ends up inadvertently spreading the rumor that she's died (while Roy tries to avoid a savage Yetilike woman).

""The IT Crowd's"" first season has a few bumps in the road (""The Haunting of Bill Crouse"" way overextends some of its jokes) but is overall a pretty solid sitcom -- think a more farcical version of ""The Office"" with a dash of ""The Mighty Boosh."" It even has Noel Fielding as the supremely freaky goth that lives down in the basement like a vampire.

And it's got some great running jokes like Dernholm's demented moodswingy personality (""Now stay away from me, you goblin!!"") and the idiots who call IT because their computers are unplugged. But each episode has its own running gags: toe-deforming shoes, office fires, and Jen accidentally convincing her treacherous date that she's a vengeful ghost (""Sttoopppp telling people you slept with meeeeee..."") And the dialogue is a big oozing bundle of hilarity (""I didn't even know she was pregnant... I thought she was stealing office equipment!"").

The core three actors are all brilliant at their very different characters -- Parkinson (who looks like a slapstickier version of Gillian Anderson) is wonderful as a pathological liar and girly-girl with the worst office on Earth. O'Dowd is gloriously sloppy and resentful about the way the rest of the employees treat him (a necessary evil), and Ayoade is gloriously monotonic and clueless (including sending an email to the fire department because he couldn't remember the new emergency number).

""The IT Crowd: The Complete Season One"" has a few weak moments, but its mix of office woes and surreal sitcomminess are priceless. Amazing Britcom!",1249776000,3,3504,4.976068376068376

2998998,5,B000X843UC,"I love this show! I also love this DVD! The menus and few extras are great!

It's nerd/geek humor, but it's not smart humor. People are goofy and there is some slapstick. And it's all the silly humor mixed in with nerd/geek references. It's just fun.

So if you want an old-school goofy comedy, this is it. If you prefer more modern non-goofy comdedy and still want the geek atmosphere, I would suggest ""flight of the Concords"" instead.

The only downside is that you only get 6 episodes here. So if you pay the msrp of $24, you're paying $4 an episode. To me that's too much. It's on a good sale now, and I hope it is when you buy it too! The 6 episodes are series 1, so you are getting a complete series. I just wish they would have done series 1-3 as one box set.

In series one, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) makes the mistake of overstating her computer skills to Denholm Reynholm (Chris Morris), the manic, slightly insane boss of Reynholm Industries.  As a reward she is sent down to manage the ""situation nerds"" in the basement -- and provide a management bridge to the corporate floors above. The team she manages -- Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and Moss (Richard Ayoade) -- are two distinctively drawn nerd types whose personalities become more endearing (and funnier) as the series progresses.  As with many Britcoms, the humor can be broad and repetitive, and frequently risque, but the cumulative effect is winning and we grow to see some of the ways the three main characters operate beyond the basement.  Especially when it comes to relationships and dating, the results are predictably disastrous and hilarious.

2999016,5,B000X843UC,"What Reynholm Industries actually creates or produces or sells is a mystery, but what the IT department of Reynholm Industries produces is terrific comedy led by a talented trio playing Jen, Roy, and Moss (ably assisted as the show progresses by whomever is the head of Reynholm in this first season, and that's all I'll say about that). You will laugh your head off at the nerdy way of things.

The players: Jen, the ""dynamic go-getter"" whose idea of lots of computer experience (a nice little fib at her job interview) is turning the computer on and off, sending and receiving email, rinse, repeat. In other words, zip qualifications to work as the manager of IT, the department exiled to the nearly windowless squalor of the basement. She gets the job all the same.

The IT department's tech-savvy workers are Roy and Moss. Roy is Irish and Moss has a guffaw-inducing strictly parted afro. They're consummate nerds (look at the posters, the t-shirts, the games they play, the social awkwardness). But with Jen at the help as the ""people person"" to buffer for the non-people people that are Roy and Moss, a team gels that continues to fall into mishaps that ensure laughter.

Trust me, the show is way, way better than my encapsulation. Moss is my particular fave. In series one, the episode where he has to lie is a hoot. My fave Moss-mess in this series is the fire episode. He's wonderful in his lack of practical knowledge. In later series, he just keeps getting funnier and more clueless about practical, non-IT matters.

Jen, though not a nerd, is hilarious in other ways (the SHOE episode!), as well as offering an earnest ambition and likability.

Roy is hot-tempered and feisty and will make you chuckle at his frustration at the computer illiteracy of others. His standard answer of ""Did you try turning it on and off?"" and ""Are you sure it's plugged in?"" will be a running gag for a few episodes, but in fresh ways.

Nerds rule comedically here, and you'll love their antics. Brits manage to be goofy and funny BUT smart, too. And this is another beloved Brit-Com to add to the list. My hubby, a software engineer, likes the little in-jokes that can be found in the accessories (posters, knick-knacks, t-shirts).

Each set/series has six episodes. In series one you have:

Yesterday's Jam--Jen is hired as manager, and the guys want her gone on the grounds of her not knowing squat about IT. But people skills count for something, yes?

Calamity Jen-- the shoes episodes. My husband and I nearly had laugh-induced strokes over the emergency number (the Brit version of 911). OMIGOSH, I won't ruin it for you, but it's dangerously funny.

Fifty-Fifty--bad date/dating episode. ""Poop"" on the forehead, too.

The Red Door--Roy is trapped under a desk with two female employees sitting on either side. No escape! And the wonderful Richmond (goth hilarity ensues) is discovered in the basement.

The Haunting of Bill Crouse--Jen is in avoidance mode, and Moss, bad at lying, panics and tells everyone she's dead. Heh.

Aunt Irma Visits--the IT boys are affected by Jen's monthly cycle. It becomes and epidemic of sympathetic PMS among nerds.

Supreme Thumbs Up! And just think, you have two more seasons to look forward to. Long live the IT CROWD.",1240012800,18,3255,4.810035842293907

It doesn't make sense really, considering the UK version is also one-disc, so I don't think it was a space issue. And what's worse, when BCI Eclipse was going to release it (which they sent out review copies for) it included them!

And just as in the case of The Big Bang Theory, The IT Crowd is hilarious. At least several times I just burst out laughing!

So the characters, we have Roy who's sort of a slacker who gets easily annoyed and always answers the phone asking, ""Did you try it on and off again?""

And finally, the new boss, Jen, who because of talking herself up on her resume ends up down in IT knowing next to nothing about computers. There are also some other hilarious minor characters including a crazy boss and a goth that works in the same office but you barely ever see! It's just a great set up.

This 1st Season is very short, only 6, 30 minute episodes. And it also ends in a ""To Be Continued..."" If this sounds even remotely interesting I suggest checking it out, you can watch the one disc season in under 2 and a half hours!",1238889600,4,1179,4.258928571428571

A lot fo British comedies don't translate well for Americans, however this one could easily be the best ever.  The interactions between Roy, Moss and Jen will leave you in stitches.  It is best to watch from the beginning of season 1 so you can see how Jen was hired, but probably not necessary.  The Dinner Party from Season 2 was the funniest piece of TV I have seen.

The 6 episode first season (or series) packs in enough comedy to equal about 18 episodes of any American sitcom.  That's 3 times as much comedy per episode!

The Red Door
The Haunting of Bill Crouse (MY PERSONAL FAVORITE)
Aunt Irma Visits

2999034,5,B000X843UC,"Buying a region-free DVD player will not enable you to view these DVDs.  North America uses the NTSC format, so you need the European player that uses the PAL format to watch them, which would pretty much preclude you needing a region-free player, since PAL players are region 2 to begin with.  You would also need a converter for your electrical outlets, as European electricity is different from ours, too.  TPTB at Amazon should specify that up there where they talk about getting a region 2 player.

That being said, this show is hilarious.  Brilliant.  The cast work well together and they all are so subtle in their delivery.

I love looking at the backgrounds.  All the crazy posters and the t-shirts Roy wears give the show a great look that only a nerd could love.

This British sitcom follows the lives of the three protagonists who make up the IT department of a generic ""runs everything and has tones of money"" corporation. Their varying levels of nerdness ensures that everyone in the audience has someone to relate to. I'm a Jen, with a little bit of Roy mixed in. The intelligent and quick-witted writing is my favorite part but there a good level of visual humor as well.

3233327,4,B000X843UC,"Sit-coms are sit-coms. So, in this day and age, you really need to be inventive to rise above the fray. This one does it in spades.

Here's the scoop. Two nerdy, socially inept, I.T. guys (Chris O'Dowd and Richard Ayoade) work in a cluttered office in the basement of a large corporation. A new, female supervisor (Katherine Parkinson) is assigned to oversee them and she knows zero about computers. So the three find themselves together trying to navigate the complexities of corporate environment, as well as the outside world itself, with varying degrees of success.

This is a real hoot. The three main characters are all something to behold. Each is drawn very well and as funny as all get out. As good as O'Dowd is, Richard Ayoade really shines. Between his immense eyeglass frames, odd hairstyle and peculiar twitchiness he really draws your attention. I've seen Katherine Parkinson in a few more serious roles so it's good to see her stretch her comic muscles. She also does a sweet job. This is not unlike ""Seinfeld"" in that you have this oddball group of characters that can only be with each other. They are too at odds with the ""real"" world. Also is the fact that the writing will introduce some seemingly insignificant something early on in the story that ends up rearing its ugly head later on.

The series sported a handful of writers/directors with Graham Linehan shouldering the lion's share. He must be one weird dude because there is such a peculiar posture on everything that it stands out from any sit-com you've ever seen.

3233334,2,B000X843UC,"This comedy is mostly slapstick (I have only seen the first two episodes; I may not watch any more of them).

To give you an example, the office manager really, really likes a pair of red high heeled shoes.  Well, she wear a size 8 or so, these are a size 5; so she goes to the store and begs the shoes sales person to put these shoes on her.  Maybe a minute is spend on trying to fit shoes that are far too small on her, with a surfeit of canned laughter (just in case you did not realize that this is the funny part).  She can barely walk in them.  We see her struggle to walk.  More canned laughter.  She takes the shoes off, and her toes are twisted.  More canned laughter.

Now, sometimes slapstick comedy is good for your 8 or 10 year old; and maybe you watch some shows with your children which are not that funny but they think they are funny.  However, the language here is strong at times (the F word is used); and although there is no nudity (so far), there are some sexual situations which I would not expose my child to.

Maybe these shows will get better, but as of show #2, I recommend against this unless you like slapstick humor (as I have described).  So far in the first two episodes, slapstick humor and over-broad characters makes up ALL of the humor in this show.

The fact that each episode is realtively short certainly enhanced the fast moving pace of this series. Each episode got funnier and funnier and while the characters personality and predictability came through, this only enhanced the humor in each of the episodes. Unlike some series comedies where one joke is bent to the point of nausea, each of these episodes had new materiel that continued to surprise and entertain !

3233380,5,B000X843UC,"Seriously, It happened to me during episode 5. Peeing on yourself laughing is also a strong possibility, Be warned.

This show is totally insane, quirky,  batty and loopy, and yet somehow manages to nail so deftly how people behave towards each other in a work place. It could and should have been a bigger hit than the ""OFFICE"" and in my opinion is much funnier. One might say this is how the ""Office"" might have looked like if Monty Payton were writing it while using heavily.
It follows 2 socially awkward IT techs in a big corporate - Roy and Moss, and their newly appointed head of IT department, Jen. As Jen's knowledge in all matters ""computery"" does not go beyond email sending and mouse clicking, it is soon settled that she will act as the ""relationship manager"" and strive to better Roy's and Moss' social status ( lower than that of the rabid toilet cleaners) among other employees of Reynholm industries.
It's certainly not just for nerds or computer savvy people - though it does have some jokes intended for that crowd. The show will tackle a bunch of intriguing topics  such as office dating, synchronized menstrual cycles, cannibalism, women shoe obsession and much much more, as well as the incredibly popular and yet so mysterious term IT- and what the hell that stands for.

The first Episode or two might be a bit too weird and crazy for the novice watcher to enjoy thoroughly, but as you get the hang of it you'll be hooked, guaranteed.

The show feels like the writers 5 minute script and stretched to fit a 24 minute time block.

Most first episodes of even the great comedies such as Andy Griffith, The Beverly Hillbillies, Dick Van Dyke, and Lucy were fairly silly at first but they seem to 'find themselves' and settle down to entertaining, somewhat believable, great comedy that ran for years. These programs presented an element that most viewers could relate to or with a little imagination, find themselves. 'I T' probably could have made it passed the second episode and beyond on my TV had it not sunk into the pit of gratuitous profanity. Somehow, these small minded writers and actors today seem to feel that if they put profanity and sex in, that will seal the deal on the making of a good comedy. Not so!

As bad as those two films were (IMO), I thought they stood out and had not heard of them doing a show together...particularly one this funny!!

From the cheesy 8 bit graphics of the opening credits, to the set design (a geek/technofile's dream if you really pay very close attention to the items laying about their basement office), this is easily one of my favorite BritComs (next to SPACED that is). Although it pre-dates ""Big Bang Theory"" by a year, if you are a fan of ""BBT"", you simply must check out The IT Crowd. Moreso if you miss how funny ""Big Bang"" USED to be before they ""jumped the shark"" or ""nuked the fridge"" in season four.

The more I go back and watch these episodes (bought all four seasons since Netflix no longer streams the show), the more I even pick up similarities to a little show called ""Seinfeld"". Now...before you Seinfeld fanatics seek to berate me with your scorn, think about it. Seinfeld was really the first show on TV that truly perfected the method of finding insanity in the mundane. I find this show, on several occasions, manages to put incredibly mundane situations into the realm of absurdity.

In short...I can't recommend this show enough!",1358294400,7,1350,4.663865546218488

The plot line, which is that two IT nerds and their somewhat clueless boss reside in a basement cubby, has nothing to do with what works here. The characters are well drawn and very, very funny. I have recommended this to some folks who say that it is British humor, but, if so, it is British humor at it Fawlty Towers best.

I ordered Season 1-4 for my dad and the only complaint is that the DVD's arrived without any paperwork even though I checked the box stating they were a gift and I wrote a gift message for each one.  He knew they must be from me because we watched some episodes at my house when he was visiting.  His internet connection is not sufficient for streaming video through Netflix or any other online service, thus the reason I purchased the DVD's.  The actors of this British sitcom do a fabulous job and the show has a strange sense of humor but it's so funny.

I was interested to find when reading the reviews, that many mentioned they could ""relate"" b/c they too were computer guys(or gals), or ""nerds"" etc(I don't mean that be offensive, just recalling things ppl wrote). Well, I'm def not an IT or computer person(& to my knowledge have never been called a nerd but that could possibly be b/c I model & most ppl think we're dumb lol). Anyway, my point is...this show is for everyone. it's the funniest thing I've seen in yrs, possibly my favortite comedy ever. I stumbled upon it by accident when I spent the weekend at my cousin's & they had no cable, we could only watch DVD's. This was already in theirs & they put it on for me. I'm very weary about new shows & didn't really think I'd like it. Well ""egg & my face were in allignment"" LOL(sorry, inside joke, you need to get the DVD's to find out what I'm referring to). I literally wanted to watch it the entire weekend. I came home & ordered every one of the 4 series. I still think the first season may have been the best but they're all hysterical, trust me,I've seen many of the episodes numerous times & never stop laughing. The only thing about this DVd in particular are the extras aren't great. There's no commentary by Graham Linehan(the writer, sorry if I've butchered his name) which is odd b.c in series 2, he does do commentary & refers back often to commentary he did on series 1 so they must've just not put it in.

3233449,4,B000X843UC,"Typical English comedy: random and unpredictable, but intelligent and well-timed.

3233450,5,B000X843UC,"I was sad when Black Books was cancelled too soon, but was happy that the co-creator decided to roll out a new show.  I have now seen seasons 1 through 4 of the IT Crowd, and I have to say that I like it as much as Black Books, though it is a different setting.

The series starts brilliantly and we are introduced to Moss and Roy, two deadbeat IT guys confined to the basement in the high rise of a prominent multi-national corporation. They are joined by Jen, an unwitting hire who knows nothing of computers but is committed to hiding this fact from everyone.

Needless to say, the show has some hilarious moments.  I found myself laughing out loud many times.  I even want to answer the phone at work ""... did you try turning it off and on again?""  The humor is similar to Father Ted and Black Books, rather dry and clever.  The actors are wonderful and especially Richard Ayoade is fantastic at bringing out audience laughter with just an expression.

I won't go into details with the individual plots or episodes.  I also peeked around at the extra features of the discs, some are fun.  The out takes are really a nice feature.

My recommendation is to watch this if you like subtle yet laugh out loud humor in that wonderful, understated British style.",1318982400,3,1259,4.454148471615721
3233451,5,B000X843UC,I recently purchased this and have only watched the first three episodes but I had to post a review saying I love this show. I guess its American counterpart is The Big Bang Theory. The IT Crowd is the funnier of the two - the characters are more developed and the plots more creative/unique. The show also has a lot of that British deadpan humor and the actors carry it off with great timing. I ended up buying all 4 seasons and am looking forward to watching the rest of the episodes.  The series gets a big thumbs up from me.,1317772800,3,528,4.227722772277228

Although the IT Crowd is based around the working relationship of a company's IT Department, it is in no way limited to appealing only to ""techies."" The IT Crowd will be appealing to anyone who loves British sitcoms, office humor, or the sometimes awkward but always funny situational humor.

Roy and Moss, two IT experts, meet their new department head, Jen, and quickly learn that she has exactly zero computer knowledge. Instead, she aims to transform the IT Department from overlooked and ignored to a respected part of the company. However, Jen is overwhelmed by the troubles and traps Roy and Moss fall into and an overzealous boss more interested in Jen than productivity.

Too bad, because the premise of this show could have been funny, entertaining, and made for great tv.  Pretty much the only funny thing is everytime their phone rings they answer by saying IT Dept ... have you tried turning on or shutting off your computer?  The odd guy with the glasses could have been an awesome character.  If this series is a spoof, I get it, but it's not a very good one.",1295568000,3,743,4.603053435114504
3233460,5,B000X843UC,"What a joy to find another 5 star BBC comedy.
It may take a few episodes to get in and stay in the groove of this brilliant BBC comedy series , well worth the effort. The humor follows closely in the way of Father Ted ,and Black Books.
Well written , Well Directed , and well acted.
The IT crowd revolves around two geeks and thier clueless Dept head who make up the IT Department of the vast Reynholm Industries  with profits of "" eighteen hundred billion billion"" for part of the year as company owner dimwitted son of founder puts it..
The IT dept. is tucked way down deep in the subterranean bowels of Reynholm Industries huge skyscraper in central London The show also features the inept Douglas Reynholm son of the founder of Reynholm Industries who now runs the Corp. with little idea of what he is doing
He hires a head of the IT dept. Jen who knows absolutely nothing about IT including what IT stands for .She is out to make her mark in the company and now oversees Moss and Roy the two geeks who are the IT dept.
happy to be out of sight and out of mind in the depths of the company they have little patience for being disturbed ""hello IT dept. have you tried turning it off and on"" is a running gag for the calls of distress. The show is absurd and funny ! and plays out like it could well have been the product of a very funny Monty Python sketch
Moss  has a bit of an edge over Roy in so far as at least knowing whats going on socially where Roy is like a new born babe and has little clue of anything outside of the nerdy side of life.
Jens social life is a mess as she often regrettably turns to Roy and Moss for help
inside the company and out this make for some wonderfully comic adventures .
The episodes quite often have that ability to build up a comedic head of steam picking up more and more laughs as the episode rolls along.
maybe one of the funniest episodes I have seen of any show, is episode 1 of season 2 titled ""work outing "" this starts out funny and builds as  the laughs get bigger and bigger, beautifully done, the direction is perfection as is the acting and writing.
but start at the very beginning season 1 become familiar with the characters it is an investment that will pay big dividends in laughs.
My wife and I went through the first 4 seasons very quickly, There are in total for four seasons a treasured 24 episodes we look forward to season 5 .I hope this review will help if you happen to be sitting on the fence
go for it ! A very well done show it has won several awards among them
BAFTA British Academy of film and Television Arts
an international Emmy. In 2006 voted Best new comedy 1st year. second year won best overall comedy it has posted several additional awards  I think the list would match the review in length but the awards show the broad range of talent Acting , Writing ,etc.

The IT Crowd is none of those things... quirky yes, and typically British dry humor in many cases but very funny with likable characters.  The opening shot of Denholm in the first episode was very reminiscent of Monty Python and from there I was hooked.  Highly recommended!",1292112000,3,392,4.82089552238806

The characters fit their stereotype without slapping you in the face with it.
The actors have fantastic chemistry and are utterly brilliant.
The scripts are clever, well written, and filled with amazing one liners.

There is a little bit of what some would consider ""inappropriate"" content so if you're concerned about that you might want to look it up on a few sites to see if its something that would bother you. Personally I think its fine.

I would recommend this show to just about anyone.",1288483200,,717,4.5

3233465,5,B000X843UC,"This Brit comedy is far from your normal sitcom. It follows 3 not so cool friends as they work in Reynholm Industries in the IT department. If you think it is anything like The Office your wrong. I personally am not a fan of The Office whereas this series I cant get enough of. The three main characters are all very funny in their own ways and they all make the show what it is. Roy is the Irishman that is lazy and has an eye for the ladies and some mischief. His facial expressions make me crack up and he is full of dull enthusiasm and sarcasm. Moss is the quintessntial nerd; he lives with his mum, wears his pants too high and loves computers. His shyness and question-everything ways are very lovable and entertaining, and he is sure to make you smile. Jen is the lady of IT and in charge of the boys. She knows nothing about computers but got stuck in the department because of bogus claims she made about her skills. She is the most normal of all the characters and the biggest ""people-person"", also the most enjoyable one to look at. While maybe not as funny as the others, she is still an essential part of the show providing a more professional presence in the department and is very easy to like.

3233466,5,B000X843UC,"I love, love, LOVE British comedies. I also love geeky humor. I think that's why I picked this series up. I haven't been disappointed by it so far.

The IT Crowd follows the three people in the IT department. Only two of them know what they're doing as Jen (their new manager) was plopped down in their department with absolutely no idea of how to do the job. However the other two are completely socially inept to the point where almost everyone else in the building despises them. Because of that Jen has to routinely run interference between her co-workers & everyone else in the building.

This show is brilliant. Not only does this have some FANTASTIC acting & endearing characters but it also manages to hit most of my geeky nerves pretty well. It's very quickly turning into one of my absolutely favorite series out there & if you like stuff like ""The Office"" then you're going to absolutely love this show. I really can't say who I love in the show more- Roy, Moss, or Richmond. Everyone does a fantastic job of playing off of each other so well!

Seriously, give this show a chance. It's worth watching again & again. Especially the season finale- no spoilers, but if you don't laugh at least once or twice during the episode then your funnybone must be dead.",1284163200,,1268,4.552631578947368

3233468,5,B000X843UC,"This is another great BAFTA and EMMY award-winning comedy from Graham Linehan who was one of the creators of 'Father Ted'. Like Father Ted this show  takes a bland sounding sitcom setup (a woman who knows very little about computers bluffs her way into a job overseeing the two-man IT department) and turns it into a surreal masterpiece.  Any character is likely to go over-the-top at any moment and some of  the imagery is ridiculously hilarious.  Chris O'Dowd plays lazy IT guy Roy who manages to seriously (and bloodily) injure himself in nearly every episode and Richard Ayoade plays the childlike and literal minded IT genius who e-mails about a fire in the office rather than phoning the Fire Dept.  Katherine Parkinson plays their supervisor Jen who initially seems to be the most ""normal"" character but soon becomes involved in idiocy of her own making. Describing the show doesn't do justice to it.

When watching the first episode, all I could think about was that this was exactly the type of sitcom Gervais was making fun of with his ""when the whistle blows"" show within a show of the Extras. It so closely resembled that satire that it was not that funny, and the laugh track was annoying and insulting. The running gag of ""did you turn it off and on again"" wears thin very quickly. The female manager's foghorn angry voice is not funny-being the loudest doesn't make what you say any more clever. I wanted to give it more of a chance than making a judgement after 23 minutes, so I watched the rest of the first 2 seasons. By the third or fourth show of the first season it was getting much better, and by season 2 I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times during each show. Like most shows, it seems to take a while for the actors to get comfortable in their characters and add some depth to them. They did drop some things that didn't work that well in season 1, like the over the top cartoonish boss and the squalor of their office. And the Goth in the closet was toned down a bit as well.

My sister and I would fake coughing fits while turning the old-fashioned knob  so that they wouldn't hear the clunking sound as we passed the channels.  I soon segue wayed into The Goodies, Alas Smith and Jones, The Fall and Rise of Reginal Perrin, that guy who would end his show with ""Good night, and may your god be with you"" (remember, I was a mere kiddiewinkie; you can't expect me to remember EVERYTHING), and of course later there was Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxies, The Young Ones and then The Office.  Benny Hill was never attractive and I just couldn't get into Red Dwarf or League of Gentlemen.

3233490,4,B000X843UC,"Take two hopeless I.T. nerds (one a slob and one a bespectacled social misfit), and add one pathologically lying people expert.

That's the setup for ""The IT Crowd,"" a fun little workplace sitcom that sits on the other end of the comedy spectrum from ""The Office"" -- in particular, hardcore farce. The first season is six episodes of pure weirdness and mild surreality, mostly focusing on desk rabbits, corporate goths, disastrous dates, too-small shoes, Aunt Irma and the occasional desk fire.

As the story begins, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) is hired by the deranged CEO Dernholm, whom she has told that she knows plenty about computers. Unfortunately, he doesn't plan to have her working on the levels that are full of ""lots of sexy people, not doing much work, and having affairs.""

So he sends her down to the I.T. department, a filthy basement occupied only with ""standard nerds"" -- an embittered slob named Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and socially oblivious Moss (Richard Ayoade). Despite the fact that they keep the company from imploding, nobody appreciates them (""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""). Initially the guys loathe Jen and vice versa, but gradually they start to appreciate one another.

But that doesn't stop the weird plots that ensue, obviously: Roy disrupts an anti-stress seminar while Jen grapples with foot-deforming shoes (think reverse childbirth). The arrival of Jen's ""Aunt Irma"" causes the geeks to have PMS. A disastrous date causes Roy to try to prove that women love jerks, and Jen's crush on a security guard goes horribly awry when he uses her as his lifeline on ""Do You Want To Be A Millionaire?""

Even stranger, the boys forbid Jen from opening The Red Door, but when Roy is trapped under a woman's desk Jen opens it and unleashes the gloomy horror within. And when Jen tries to avoid an obnoxious date, Moss ends up inadvertently spreading the rumor that she's died (while Roy tries to avoid a savage Yetilike woman).

""The IT Crowd's"" first season has a few bumps in the road (""The Haunting of Bill Crouse"" way overextends some of its jokes) but is overall a pretty solid sitcom -- think a more farcical version of ""The Office"" with a dash of ""The Mighty Boosh."" It even has Noel Fielding as the supremely freaky goth that lives down in the basement like a vampire.

And it's got some great running jokes like Dernholm's demented moodswingy personality (""Now stay away from me, you goblin!!"") and the idiots who call IT because their computers are unplugged. But each episode has its own running gags: toe-deforming shoes, office fires, and Jen accidentally convincing her treacherous date that she's a vengeful ghost (""Sttoopppp telling people you slept with meeeeee..."") And the dialogue is a big oozing bundle of hilarity (""I didn't even know she was pregnant... I thought she was stealing office equipment!"").

The core three actors are all brilliant at their very different characters -- Parkinson (who looks like a slapstickier version of Gillian Anderson) is wonderful as a pathological liar and girly-girl with the worst office on Earth. O'Dowd is gloriously sloppy and resentful about the way the rest of the employees treat him (a necessary evil), and Ayoade is gloriously monotonic and clueless (including sending an email to the fire department because he couldn't remember the new emergency number).

""The IT Crowd: The Complete Season One"" has a few weak moments, but its mix of office woes and surreal sitcomminess are priceless. Amazing Britcom!",1249776000,3,3504,4.976068376068376

It's nerd/geek humor, but it's not smart humor. People are goofy and there is some slapstick. And it's all the silly humor mixed in with nerd/geek references. It's just fun.

So if you want an old-school goofy comedy, this is it. If you prefer more modern non-goofy comdedy and still want the geek atmosphere, I would suggest ""flight of the Concords"" instead.

The only downside is that you only get 6 episodes here. So if you pay the msrp of $24, you're paying $4 an episode. To me that's too much. It's on a good sale now, and I hope it is when you buy it too! The 6 episodes are series 1, so you are getting a complete series. I just wish they would have done series 1-3 as one box set.

In series one, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) makes the mistake of overstating her computer skills to Denholm Reynholm (Chris Morris), the manic, slightly insane boss of Reynholm Industries.  As a reward she is sent down to manage the ""situation nerds"" in the basement -- and provide a management bridge to the corporate floors above. The team she manages -- Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and Moss (Richard Ayoade) -- are two distinctively drawn nerd types whose personalities become more endearing (and funnier) as the series progresses.  As with many Britcoms, the humor can be broad and repetitive, and frequently risque, but the cumulative effect is winning and we grow to see some of the ways the three main characters operate beyond the basement.  Especially when it comes to relationships and dating, the results are predictably disastrous and hilarious.  With six short episodes (22 minutes each), Season One is easy to sit through in a single evening.

I hope that they will be releasing seasons 2 and 3 soon on US region Dvd's.",1241308800,5,370,4.125

3233512,5,B000X843UC,"Yes, we all know Britcoms are brilliant.

This one is at the top of that heap.  Possibly the best thing I've seen in years.

Anyone who has ever tried to get a computer fixed or worked for a large corporation will understand the place this show comes from.  It lays bare the absurdity of the rapid rise of the machines, and the inevitable fact that they are, after all, created by, and cared for simple human beings, with all the baggage and anxiety that entails.

Great characters, witty dialog, fun stories.

We watched the first season by accident at a friend's place - after the first one we were all so sucked in that we couldn't stop, and stayed up half the night to watch the whole season!

Thank you, Britain.",1240012800,2,717,4.427480916030534
3233513,5,B000X843UC,"What Reynholm Industries actually creates or produces or sells is a mystery, but what the IT department of Reynholm Industries produces is terrific comedy led by a talented trio playing Jen, Roy, and Moss (ably assisted as the show progresses by whomever is the head of Reynholm in this first season, and that's all I'll say about that). You will laugh your head off at the nerdy way of things.

The players: Jen, the ""dynamic go-getter"" whose idea of lots of computer experience (a nice little fib at her job interview) is turning the computer on and off, sending and receiving email, rinse, repeat. In other words, zip qualifications to work as the manager of IT, the department exiled to the nearly windowless squalor of the basement. She gets the job all the same.

The IT department's tech-savvy workers are Roy and Moss. Roy is Irish and Moss has a guffaw-inducing strictly parted afro. They're consummate nerds (look at the posters, the t-shirts, the games they play, the social awkwardness). But with Jen at the help as the ""people person"" to buffer for the non-people people that are Roy and Moss, a team gels that continues to fall into mishaps that ensure laughter.

Trust me, the show is way, way better than my encapsulation. Moss is my particular fave. In series one, the episode where he has to lie is a hoot. My fave Moss-mess in this series is the fire episode. He's wonderful in his lack of practical knowledge. In later series, he just keeps getting funnier and more clueless about practical, non-IT matters.

Jen, though not a nerd, is hilarious in other ways (the SHOE episode!), as well as offering an earnest ambition and likability.

Roy is hot-tempered and feisty and will make you chuckle at his frustration at the computer illiteracy of others. His standard answer of ""Did you try turning it on and off?"" and ""Are you sure it's plugged in?"" will be a running gag for a few episodes, but in fresh ways.

Nerds rule comedically here, and you'll love their antics. Brits manage to be goofy and funny BUT smart, too. And this is another beloved Brit-Com to add to the list. My hubby, a software engineer, likes the little in-jokes that can be found in the accessories (posters, knick-knacks, t-shirts).

Each set/series has six episodes. In series one you have:

Yesterday's Jam--Jen is hired as manager, and the guys want her gone on the grounds of her not knowing squat about IT. But people skills count for something, yes?

Calamity Jen-- the shoes episodes. My husband and I nearly had laugh-induced strokes over the emergency number (the Brit version of 911). OMIGOSH, I won't ruin it for you, but it's dangerously funny.

Fifty-Fifty--bad date/dating episode. ""Poop"" on the forehead, too.

The Red Door--Roy is trapped under a desk with two female employees sitting on either side. No escape! And the wonderful Richmond (goth hilarity ensues) is discovered in the basement.

The Haunting of Bill Crouse--Jen is in avoidance mode, and Moss, bad at lying, panics and tells everyone she's dead. Heh.

Aunt Irma Visits--the IT boys are affected by Jen's monthly cycle. It becomes and epidemic of sympathetic PMS among nerds.

Supreme Thumbs Up! And just think, you have two more seasons to look forward to. Long live the IT CROWD.",1240012800,18,3255,4.810035842293907
3233514,4,B000X843UC,"First off, let me say the show itself is great and very funny, and deserves five-stars. The only reason the DVD didn't get five-stars is because it isn't perfect. Namely, it is missing two features that appeared on the UK version: audio commentaries for each episode and outtakes. It doesn't make sense really, considering the UK version is also one-disc, so I don't think it was a space issue. And what's worse, when BCI Eclipse was going to release it (which they sent out review copies for) it included them! So, if you really like the show, and have the ability to watch a UK DVD, you'd be better off getting that so you don't miss anything.",1239321600,57,645,4.521367521367521
3233515,5,B000X843UC,"There were a number of episodes where I laughed so hard that I had to pause the episode so that I could regain my ability to breathe.

3233516,5,B000X843UC,"Absolutely fantastic.  This has to be the best written and performed British comedy in years. It is incredibly short, but has lots and lots of replay value.  Every detail of the set and costuming is dead on and steeped in tech culture.  Don't miss the chance to watch this show!",1239062400,2,278,4.52
3233517,4,B000X843UC,"Being a fan of the nerdy humor I was instantly attracted to this, doesn't hurt that it has one of the same producers as The Office as well. Instantly it reminded me of another of my favorite nerdy shows, The Big Bang Theory. Two nerds and a girl, yup, same concept. And just as in the case of The Big Bang Theory, The IT Crowd is hilarious. At least several times I just burst out laughing!

So the characters, we have Roy who's sort of a slacker who gets easily annoyed and always answers the phone asking, ""Did you try it on and off again?"" And then, my favorite the sort of socially clueless Moss (so cute!) who wears too-short pants. And finally, the new boss, Jen, who because of talking herself up on her resume ends up down in IT knowing next to nothing about computers. There are also some other hilarious minor characters including a crazy boss and a goth that works in the same office but you barely ever see! It's just a great set up.

This 1st Season is very short, only 6, 30 minute episodes. And it also ends in a ""To Be Continued..."" If this sounds even remotely interesting I suggest checking it out, you can watch the one disc season in under 2 and a half hours!",1238889600,4,1179,4.258928571428571

A lot fo British comedies don't translate well for Americans, however this one could easily be the best ever.  The interactions between Roy, Moss and Jen will leave you in stitches.  It is best to watch from the beginning of season 1 so you can see how Jen was hired, but probably not necessary.  The Dinner Party from Season 2 was the funniest piece of TV I have seen.  So funny I downloaded it to my iPod!",1235692800,2,568,4.118181818181818

Didn't the reception of Spaced in the States pave the way for someone to get the US DVD rights to this show and make a ton of cash selling it?

It does what most US shows forgot about years ago, it's a show that expects that you'll come to it with some intelligence and it serves up the laughs.

I certainly hope I get to pick up a complete series set soon.",1235606400,,415,3.9759036144578315

3233531,5,B000X843UC,"Buying a region-free DVD player will not enable you to view these DVDs.  North America uses the NTSC format, so you need the European player that uses the PAL format to watch them, which would pretty much preclude you needing a region-free player, since PAL players are region 2 to begin with.  You would also need a converter for your electrical outlets, as European electricity is different from ours, too.  TPTB at Amazon should specify that up there where they talk about getting a region 2 player.

That being said, this show is hilarious.  Brilliant.  The cast work well together and they all are so subtle in their delivery.

I love looking at the backgrounds.  All the crazy posters and the t-shirts Roy wears give the show a great look that only a nerd could love.

It's currently playing on IFC channel, so if you're lucky enough to have that, definitely give this show a go.  You won't regret it.",1228348800,4,907,4.6125
