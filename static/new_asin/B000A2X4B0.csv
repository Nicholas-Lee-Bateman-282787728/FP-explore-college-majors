2352793,5,B000A2X4B0,"Okay, everyone says how bad this is (with one exception) and I loved it.  I buy every snake movie that comes out and this is much better than many of them in recent times.  One reviewer complained about the cobra talking.  He apparently missed the point entirely.  The lawyer is napping and IN HER DREAM the snake talks to her -- but only in her dream, and as we all know anything can happen in a dream.  The only thing I didn't care for was the dancing snakes, but it was kind of funny if totally out of place.  Another reviewer said only 2 people survived -- not true, there were 3 survivors and one of them was a lawyer (of course).  There is one place where a dead man's mouth falls open and a snake crawls out of  his mouth.  That really creeped me out.  Yes there are a few false scares but they are there to raise the tension and set the scene for the real snake scenes.  Okay, it's not Macbeth or Tolstoy or whoever.  It's just a killer snake movie and for what it is I have watched it over and over and over.  There are a couple of other snake movies, Silent Predators and Rattled (also starring William Katt) that I also enjoy very much.  But Rattled has not been released on dvd, darn it.  Just the same I watch a snake movie to be scared and I would NOT put my foot down until I looked under the couch even though common sense says there can't be anything there; and even when I do this I know it is illogical -- I mean why would I want to be bitten on the face instead of the foot.  But I still had to check.  For what it is worth I do have unusual tastes and not every one will like it but I had to set the record straight -- the talking cobra is only in the lawyer's dream!!).  I can't stand it when someone watches a movie and has no idea what actually went on in the movie.  Makes me wonder about how they could miss the point.",1362873600,,1844,4.016483516483516
2352794,3,B000A2X4B0,fair movie it's ok for a late night time killer so if you fall asleep you really don't mind missing parts of movie.,1346889600,,115,4.043478260869565
2352795,4,B000A2X4B0,"This movie came out during the time when it was a lot of snake movies since Anaconda with Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube was successful. However this was cheaply made, the budget used to fund this was probably less than what's in my pocket right now. The plot is ripped off Anaconda's (1997) movie, and the director really did not try to be creative with this movie. I understand not everybody can afford a huge 20,000,000 dollar project, but you can still make a good cheap movie by being creative, I honestly believe I could have done a better job on a snake film. But this movie is funny to me, because of its cheap quality and dry characters, I give this 4 stars for it being funny.",1334534400,,683,4.34375
2352796,1,B000A2X4B0,"Since the beginning of the movie I knew something was up. Constant jabs at shock and surprises for things that didn't really amount to much. Then there were the constant camera angles signifying the creeping coming of another snake. Ugh. Then here we have a league of people who all know the inhabitants of the island is crawling with snakes, almost at every corner, and they feel the need to party or get comfortable. Omg. Then we have a inside the cabin duel with numerous snakes, and the man suggests they sleep until dawn after the battle is won. Who could possibly sleep after that? But the woman does, on the couch, and lunges up when she has a terrifying encounter, to which the man who comes to her aid asks, ""What's the matter?' As if he could possibly be clueless.
I often defend the worst branded movies for certain situations that might be redeeming, but this one is the one to condemn. Condemn the world or the island of the snakes. Almost sounds biblical, but this movie sinks to new lows like never before.",1327968000,,1021,4.524324324324325
2352797,3,B000A2X4B0,"Come on! What did you really EXPECT from this movie??? As a die hard b-rated creature flick fan, I am glad I have learned to disregard a lot of the negative reviews...and because of that choice I have not missed out on a lot of films I would have had I listened to others. I really enjoyed this fun little flick. Acting wasn't all that bad, plot was okay, suspense was great. True there were 2 scenes that were just way out there, like the snakes dancing...but I could totally overlook those two scenes for all the greatness of the rest of the movie. If you like B-rated feature films, then you most likely won't be disappointed. Give it a try - definitely worth the rental fee, and I am even considering buying it for my collection!",1276473600,,733,4.357664233576642
2352798,3,B000A2X4B0,"A group of American tourists heading down an African river make a brief stop at Snake Island, an island that has been virtually abandoned for years. When they end up getting trapped on the island overnight, they find thousands of deadly snakes intent on reclaiming the tropical island for themselves. Snake Island presents the perfect getaway and a movie with a true sense of its own hilarious antics.",1265673600,,401,4.911764705882353
2352799,4,B000A2X4B0,This movie is just flat out funny. I guess they tried to make it a horror but the snakes at times are the funniest thing ever. If you like a light horror with humor to it then this is the movie for you.,1242000000,,202,3.7209302325581395

2352801,1,B000A2X4B0,"I like creature features generally but this one was so lame that i stopped watching 3/4 of the way thru.

A few tourists/travellers are stranded on an island full of little poisonous snakes .

The people talk a lot and they show lots of snakes crawling around .

They have a big party,get drunk and fool around even though the resort workers are all dead from snakebites.

Eventually the snakes get bored and start killing the people.

I don't blame them.

I assume there was no director at all for this stinker

Avoid at all costs.",1127347200,,532,4.479166666666667
2352810,3,B000A2X4B0,"Wayne Crawford wrote, directed and produced this film, a serpentine variant on ""Frogs"" and ""Birds"".  He looks ugly as sin but (since he is the writer/director/producer) he's the only guy in the film who scores. He's also, together with bankable star William Katt, the only guy who survives.  Lots of nice shots of snakes, nice South African nature shots, and two nice nude scenes - Heather skinny dipping 45 minutes in and Lisa in the shower at 55 minutes.",1102896000,,456,4.7594936708860756
2352811,1,B000A2X4B0,William Katt would be better served doing infomercials than this garbage.,1088726400,,73,5.7272727272727275
2352812,1,B000A2X4B0,"I saw this movie for free, and thank heavens for that.  A friend loaned it to me ""just in case"" I'd like it.  And I can't say I blame him for thinking that... from the picture on the cover, it really does look like ""my kind of"" movie.  No photograph, but instead a rather crude painting of a giant snake next to a smaller image of a number of people running from a number of more regular-sized snakes.  This rather timeless image, together with the lack of any release date on the case, led me to believe it possible that this might be a 1960s-70s Hammer-esque monster movie, about a bunch of people under seige by an ever-advancing wall of serpentine evil, with maybe a climax involving a giant, monster-sized daddy snake.  Unfortunately, this movie, from 2002, is nothing like what I thought it might be (that's what happens when you're optimistic about anything... lesson here? Never assume the best).  I was never expecting a masterpiece, but I was expecting to have fun... I was right about the first expectation but wrong about the second.
""Snake Island"" stars William Katt, of ""Greatest American Hero"" fame (feel free to make your own 'Believe it or Not' joke), some black British girl, a generic couple of newlyweds, and a guy who at times looks like Robert DeNiro and a woman who at times looks like Terry Farrell.  Oh, and a guy who seems to be a hybrid of John Rhys-Davies and Peter Jackson (I could never seem to decide which of the two of them he reminded me the most of).
Our cast becomes stranded on an island conveniently crawling with snakes (good for us, as I was rooting for the snakes anyway), and nearly the first hour of this film an infurating sequence of the snakes not being noticed/almost attacking someone/someone thinking their being attacked by a snake when it's really just an innocent misunderstanding or someone playing a joke on them.  Just like the boy who cried wolf, though this time the movie is playing it with us.  And believe me, it gets OLD.  I wouldn't have minded one or two before things started to get ugly and the snakes began their all-out assult, but to have to put up with nearly an hour of this, is really just frustrating.  Any interest you might have had for what was happening will really be killed while you wait for the first body to drop (this is of course not counting the death scene during the pre-credits sequence, where the man we see running in terror could be looking for an airline sickness bag for all we know... there's not a snake to be seen).  At least the credits music was kind of pleasant, if inappropriately upbeat.
I do have something good to say about this movie once we're about an hour and ten minutes into it or so... After all that waiting (and believe me, it feels like forever), we FINALLY find ourselves in the movie I was expecting this to be from the very beginning.  Sadly, the moment doesn't last.  If 1.3 were a possible rating here at Amazon, that's what I'd give this.
Some of the more odd things about this movie should be mentioned, I suppose.  But their not odd in an interesting way, their odd in a ""What the heck did they think they were doing"" kind of way... didn't they stop to think that people would actually be watching this?  Two things, I have in mind, specifically: during a party scene where we're subjected to some horrendously awful techno-dance music, we have snakes dancing along with it (that really came out of nowhere), using a state-of-the-art effects method that involves playing back and forth the same second of footage over and over again in a continuous loop, allowing the snake to ""move"" back and forth to the beat.  The second happens about fifteen minutes from the end, when a pair of cobras, while sneeking up on the Terry Ferrell-look-alike, begin to talk and sing.  Yes, you read that right, TALK and SING.  As if this were a kids puppet show.  And they don't even speak in hissy, snake-like voices... they have these deep, fake-British accents.  If this film had been a spoof, that's one thing, but as it seemed to try to take itself seriously up to that point (aside from the dancing snake bit I mentioned already)... ""We hate people, yes we do, As far as we're concerned they're just something to chew.""  I mean, what were the guys in production drinking that day?  This scene leads to another scene toward the end, when William Katt's character looks up and finds himself face-to-face with a cobra (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" Well of Souls-style).  The snake stares at him, he stares at the snake, the snake opens its mouth... and as this happens following the infamous ""singing snake"" scene, I wasn't expecting the cobra to spit or strike, as I imagine we're supposed to... I was expecting the snake to shout, ""HOWAYAH?"" and then give Mr. Katt a kiss.
Do yourself a favor and give this movie a skip.  If giant monster creatures/nature running amok films are your cup of tea, watch anything else besides this... you'll thank me, and even if you don't (you lazy thing) you'll at least have the comfort of knowing that you had more fun than I did.  This movie bites, ""Believe it or Not"". Heh heh heh.

2352814,4,B000A2X4B0,"The thing I really liked about Snake Island is
that it could happen. Thousands of ticked-off
snakes trap a few unsuspecting humans on an
remote island.
These people aren't cleverly overcoming a 400
foot ""freak of nature"", they're fighting just
to survive the onslaught of literally thousands
of venomous reptiles.
A boat load of interesting characters stop at
Snake Island, which is a tourist resort in Africa,
for various reasons. They're there for a good time
and they actually do for awhile.
This movie has a really good sense of humor
at times.
These people are believeable. There are no
heavy duty killers on the run or evil scientists
hiding amoungst the crew, ordinary tourists
or people on business.
It may take awhile for anyone to realize they
landed in the wrong place at the wrong time
(although the audience knows right away),
but, once they do, things happen at a furious
pace.
The real snakes are everywhere. They have killed
before to survive, and as some in this current
group of visitors begins to pose a threat, they
react again in the same deadly manner.
Without giving away the whole plot, I think the
""punchline"" of Snake Island is that it's sometimes
enough just to survive a terrorizing situation.
It reminded me of my wartime experience.
Because of it's sense of reality, I really enjoyed
this flick.",1064275200,,1325,4.815789473684211
2352815,3,B000A2X4B0,"I wouldn't have seen this movie if I hadn't seen the trailer for it.  The title sounded stupid, but the trailer looked very good.  Some parts were really creative and inspiring.  Others were not, like the part where the snakes were dancing, or when one got frozen by a fire hydrant and tipped over.  My favorite part, on the other hand, was Lisa's shower scene.  It was well-acted and dramatic.  There were also some other parts liked, but I can't remember them at the moment.",1063238400,,476,4.541176470588235
