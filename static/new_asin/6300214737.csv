7805634,3,6300214737,"Campus Man is a guilty pleasure with Brett Wilson and Cactus Jack providing all the eye candy a film might need. Why do millions of viewers watch the men's diving competition every four years? Fit young men making a splash (or as little as possible) in the pool is the easy answer.

The fictional diver Brett Wilson has the looks and form to deliver every time you put Campus Man in your DVD player.",1500249600,,399,4.391891891891892

7805642,3,6300214737,"Nothing spectacular about this movie, but brings back memories because I was an extra in it during my sophomore year at ASU (only $35 for 12 hours of sitting around). I think I'm in the first scene -- wearing a sweater when I think it was supposed to be summer (they shot it over December break). My buddy actually got a more prominent role -- he's one of the computer nerds (think he's wearing one of those fisherman style hats) who gets arrested. My other buddy was annoyed that his boss at the bookstore got a speaking part -- and then he was happy when they dubbed over the guy's high pitched voice with a more manly voice.

Anyway, cheesy 80s teen fare with a predictable story that is, however, loosely based on a real story. The guy who came up with story was an ASU student who produced a beefcake calendar featuring the ASU dive team -- I think it was one of the 1st popular male calendars.

John Dye (R.I.P.) was in the scene I was an extra in and I was glad when he got a decent role on TV.",1392076800,2,1001,4.181347150259067
