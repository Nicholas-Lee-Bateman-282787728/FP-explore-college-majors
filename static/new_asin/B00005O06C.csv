1637923,5,B00005O06C,My kids just love this pack of three Disney's movies.  My kids watched it over and over.  Even better it does not wear like the VHS tapes.,1021420800,,138,4.074074074074074
1637924,5,B00005O06C,Pixar's animation is terrific on all three of these wonderful movies.  The DVD add-ons help make this bundle a good buy for the price.,1020729600,,134,4.583333333333333

1637926,5,B00005O06C,"3 great films and all for a bargain price.
The only let down is that Disney are a bit shy with extra features so it is identical to the Video's I bought in the UK. Saying that, It is such good value that I can over look the lack of features.
Still as Disney goes it doesn't get much better ... to infinity and beyond !!!!!",1012953600,3,322,3.893939393939394
1637927,5,B00005O06C,"What more can we ask from Disney/Pixer than to have 3 best ever animations in one low priced pack? Maybe, to add Monsters, Inc too? If you don't own any of these movies get your hands on this one and you will get more than your moneys worth. This pack also includes a free movie pass to Monsters, Inc.
All three movies have great reviews all over amazon and there is no reason for me to add more details than to inform that they come with all the extras found in Gold Collection DVD of Bugs' Life and Toy Story 2-Pack.",1010793600,18,518,4.138613861386139
1637928,5,B00005O06C,"I am new to watching DVD's, so I do not know a lot about ""special features"" and added extra's on a DVD.  This is a great set for the price.  It has all three movies on three different disks.  There are outakes on the Toy Story movie that you can view.  On the Toy Story 2 disk, it has that little movie about how Pixar started to use the bouncing light for their logo.  (It's animated and a very cute movie.)  If you appreciate these movies and want them in your collection to view when you want to, this is the set you want.  It is a great value at a great price for 3 new DVD's!  If you are a big DVD buff though and are looking for special stuff...see the reviews listed elsewhere on this page.  Personally, I like the movies and just wanted to be able to watch them whenever I wanted to so this set is great!",1009324800,16,812,3.9937888198757765
1637929,3,B00005O06C,"This is a great set to buy if you have kids who don't care about special features. This set presents just the movie with a few extra bells and whistles. However, if you're a huge fan of these films, as I am, there's better versions packed with special features. Toy Story & Toy Story 2 can be found together with each disk filled to the brim of special features along with an additional disk of special features. This is called the Toy Story Toy Box. Bug's life has another version other then the Gold version presented in this box set. It's a collector's 2 disk edition, also packed with special features (returning in August 2003). These are the definitive versions of these movies. Don't buy this box set if you're looking for more. If you have kids, it's fine ...",1004313600,23,767,4.485714285714286

1637933,5,B00005O06C,I purchased this because not only are the movies great but these were the first 3 moves using Pixar's new (at that time) animation.  These are classics.,1395446400,,152,4.62962962962963
1637934,5,B00005O06C,"Way back when, I bought this 3-pack to get started on DVDs. These are just the pure movies, no special features or anything, but the movies are excellent.

Toy Story reminds us of our need to be ourselves, but to know who we are. And to be nice to our toys.

A Bug's Life is a reminder of standing together against troublemakers, bullies, and oppressors. Even if all you can get on your side are some outcast clowns and a flea.

Toy Story 2 is possibly the best movie ever. There's love, angst, rejection, and the realization that even a mentor can lose his way. But we can all come back, all find a future. Even if we're a stinky prospector.",1383782400,,642,4.289256198347108
1637935,5,B00005O06C,"The kids love them, and even today will watch them on a whim out of all the movies in our collection.  The three pack at the time of purchase saved us a lot of money.  I bought this years ago on Amazon, and enjoy the 3 pack so much I'm finally adding to the five-star ratings after reminders to review my purchases!",1362441600,,315,4.064516129032258
1637936,5,B00005O06C,"I got this collection for my nephew because he loves Buzz Lightyear.  I knew the Toy Story movies would be a hit, but A Bug's Life was an added bonus.",1354838400,,150,4.0
1637937,5,B00005O06C,"TOY STORY

The first movie in this collection is easily the best. Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios created not only the first computer-animated film, but a movie with strong positive messages about the value of friendship and the importance of family which only get stronger with each installment, stellar animation and excellent, top-notch casting (Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney) and heart. Rated G.

  TOY STORY 2

This second installment to the wildly successful film Toy Story is a rare sequel that manages to match AND TOP its predecessor. The positive messages about friendship and family get even stronger here, with Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Jodi Benson and Wayne Knight joining the cast and adding to the fun, with spectacular animation and heart. Rated G.

  A BUG'S LIFE

The third film in this collection, however, is somewhat of a disappointment. With a less-than-stellar voice cast (the only known actors being Hayden Pattinere, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey), stellar animation and a mediocre story-line, with a mediocre positive message about how even an outcast can make a difference, this film is flat. But it has some good moments. Nowhere near as good as the three TOY STORY films, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc (I have not yet seen Cars or Cars 2). Rated G.",1316304000,,1372,5.089285714285714
1637938,5,B00005O06C,Product is in new condition.  I like the 3 pac as it has its own storage box that stays up on the shelf.,1252713600,,104,3.5217391304347827
1637939,5,B00005O06C,This is a great gift -- either to receive or to give.  It's a great way to start or to augment a growing Disney/DVD collection.,1184803200,,127,4.08
1637940,5,B00005O06C,Toy Story is a must have video for any family...Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life are also cute!! :),1167696000,,95,3.8
1637941,5,B00005O06C,"These three movies are three of the best cartoons ever made. The first Toy Story began Pixar's move into the mainstream and it was a groundbreaker. A Bug's Life will feel a bit more like a children's story compared with the Toy Storys, but, though it may be Pixar's worst, it is better than all of Disney's modern cartoons with the exception of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. Toy Story 2 is Pixar's best (Finding Nemo a close second). I've never laughed as hard as I had throughout the story. The comedic moments were perfectly timed. The references to other movies were perfect. And as the movie progressed, the more you laughed. Not only that, but it also had an actual serious message, with a moment in the middle that made you think rather than just laugh.
Truly perfect.",1061596800,2,778,4.564285714285714
1637942,5,B00005O06C,I love this bundle for my 3 yr old.  He loves Buzz and this 3 pack gives him a choice of what to watch.  Kids don't need any extras and it saves you money to buy the bundle.  You get three great movies at one low price.,1059350400,,219,3.617021276595745
1637943,5,B00005O06C,"I had all three movies on video tape, the kids have worn out the video tape watching them so often.  These are must have movies for your collection the kids will love them. (I must admit I do too!!)",1058745600,,198,4.076923076923077
1637944,5,B00005O06C,"All right.  I admit it.  In my eyes, Pixar can do no wrong.  They're four for four as far as I'm concerned.
This 3-pack includes full-screen and letter-boxed versions of their first 3 full-length features: Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2.  It doesn't include tons of bonus material like you'd get in a full-blowen collectors's edition, but unless you're a hard-core enthusiast, you probably won't miss anything.
The movies themselves, are magnificent.
The story telling is first rate.  Like what one would expect from classical Disney work, they're entertaining to both kids and adults.  A bit of everything: engaging stories, clever humor, heart-felt moments, a bit of action and suspense, and characters that you get attached to.
And Pixar is the benchmark against which all other computer animation is measured.  Meanwhile, Pixar manages a artful balance between the realism of computer animation and the expressiveness found in cel animation.
I look forward to the next boxed set, of Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, and whatever they have next up their sleeves.",1054080000,3,1071,5.15606936416185
1637945,5,B00005O06C,"Pixar rules...plain and simple. These aren't the special editions or anything so not much extra but if you don't own any of Disney/Pixar's movies, you need to pick this one up! If you've never seen these movies, they are hillarious. The amount of detail is just awesome.",1050537600,2,270,4.76595744680851
1637946,4,B00005O06C,"Both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are classic movies for all ages, but a bug's life is not worthy of being placed in this collection. Don't make the mistake of buying this boxset, instead of the three disk Toy story set that has a third disk packed with tons of extras from the making of the movie. The two movies are obviously the same great quality no matter which set you buy, but for me, I want to see the creativity that went into producing such a classic.",1041465600,10,458,4.157303370786517
1637947,5,B00005O06C,"I was a little bit skeptical about this great buy, but it's true.  You get three great Pixar movies in DVD format for a great price.  On each disc you can choose widescreen or fullscreen viewing, you can get English captions, there are sneak peeks and outtakes, and each has an extra cartoon: Toy Story carries the entertaining short ""Tin Toy"" (with a remarkably horrid looking infant); Toy Story 2 contains a Luxo, Jr. cartoon; and A Bug's Life has ""Geri's Game"".
As another reviewer has stated, if it is the special features you crave then this is not the collection for you; however, if you just want to watch the films and don't care about the extras, this is a remarkable value.",1034294400,47,683,4.544715447154472
1637948,5,B00005O06C,"3 DVDs triple the fun! I love today's new cartoons.  3D animation and digital sound is very advanced nowdays.
I love this pack because it has toy story 1, 2 and bug's life.
The set makes perfect gift for any kid or adult, as the movies are enjoyed by people of all ages.
The characters are detailed well, their facial expressions are very realistic.  The music & effects are very nice & match the scenes.
Highly recommended for all ages.",1025049600,,437,4.45
