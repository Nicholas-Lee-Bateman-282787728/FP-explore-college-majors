4250930,5,B0042HOQ02,"Our five year old granddaughter is a an Attenborough groupie. These documentaries are the Gold Standard for nature film making. But was amazes me is how the all the information is presented and this five year old ""gets"" it.",1363046400,,223,4.743589743589744
4250931,1,B0042HOQ02,"The DVD was ordered as a gift. When I gave it to the recipient and he tried to play it, it wouldn't run. After finally contacting the distributor, they said that there are different versions for different geographic areas. The one I was sent would not play in the US.
Don't you think they would have been smart enough to send the version that would play in the area I was ording from and having it delivered to? Duh!",1362787200,,416,4.2784810126582276
4250932,5,B0042HOQ02,It's a shame that the lack of Region 2 labeling on this product page has resulted in such a low rating for a fantastic documentary.  The reconstructions of creatures from the Burgess Shale is worth both the price and the inconvenience all on its own.,1360195200,10,250,4.555555555555555
4250933,1,B0042HOQ02,"The information on amazon did not disclose the dvd was region 2, and thus we could not play it. Often, on the amazon site there is a warning so the mistake isn't made, but was not in this case, and I am sure I am not the first to be burned. I contacted the seller, who seemed sympathetic, but not enough to refund.",1356048000,8,314,4.0
8413698,5,B0042HOQ02,"This series is a good one. The CGI is pretty decent, the expert opinions on the very first animals are intriguing, and the explanations as to why they're no longer around are amazing. The host does a good job explaining the science in a way the viewers can understand. This is a recommended program for hardcore Attenborough fans.",1522800000,,330,4.706896551724138
8413699,5,B0042HOQ02,"David Attenborough....enough said, he is simply the best in the world at this, love him.",1469577600,,88,4.933333333333334
8413700,5,B0042HOQ02,"A very well made BBC educational documentary on the history and origins of early life on Planet Earth.
It's similar to a PBS NOVA documentary called Origins which is also sold on Amazon
First Life is a must see!
No problem with playing this on a US computer DVD player with VLC player  even if a little inconvenient not being able to play
on a North American region DVD player.",1453420800,,377,4.385714285714286

8413703,5,B0042HOQ02,"I haven't watched it either, yet.  But generally I love anything Mr. Attenborough does.  I knew the disks were Region 2 when I made the purchase.

Like all my DVD's and Blu-Ray disks first use MakeMKV to put the digital content on my computer, then I use Handbrake to convert the MKV files to mp4 format and copy the results on to my NAS so that I can watch them any time I want from any TV in the house.

It is extra work, I've done it more than 13,000 times, but generally that is how one builds a library on their media server.

Or one can just buy a ""region free"" media player, but I find physically herding 13,000 titles to be unmanageable.  Just rip it once, it's mine I own it because I paid for it and pick it off a menu and play it with out ever touching a physical disk again.",1422748800,5,786,4.038709677419355
8413704,5,B0042HOQ02,"According to the information provided by Amazon for the Italian blu-ray of First Life shown on this page, this should be compatible with both North American (blu-ray Region A) and European (Region B) players, which is not the case for the standard DVD, which is for Europe (DVD Region 2) only. I haven't tested the Italian blu-ray release because I bought instead the Dutch blu-ray currently available from Amazon.co.uk, at roughly half the price. The Dutch blu-ray appears to be region-free, as it played fine in my North American blu-ray player. The audio is in English, and it's easy to turn off the Dutch subtitles. Those interested may wish to check out my review on Amazon.co.uk.",1422403200,5,685,4.913793103448276
8413705,1,B0042HOQ02,Did not mean to send this with one star....I haven't seen it yet. The disc came from England which is Zone 2....I am in Zone 1 and it would not run on my DVD player. I have learned a valuable lesson!,1405468800,,199,3.8780487804878048
8413706,5,B0042HOQ02,"Great Body of work, Entertaining delivery system, and captivating all the way.
Love to see more work available on Amazon on DVDs by David Attenborough.

8413707,5,B0042HOQ02,As always David Attenbourough has done a great job of taking a complex topic such as the fossil record and making it understandable to all. Too bad this DVD is for Europe only it would be a great resource for science buffs and educators here in the US.,1364688000,7,252,4.270833333333333
