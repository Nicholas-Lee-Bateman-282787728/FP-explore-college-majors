8153146,5,B000JUB2RG,"I reviewed many CD's on digital photography only to find most were camera specific, boring, way to advanced, or over priced for what you got. ""Photos in a Flash"" is a great teaching tool. It is, in my opinion, the best product on the market for teaching entry level digital photography. My only complaint is that the second series has not been published yet.",1223251200,,358,4.609375
8153147,5,B000JUB2RG,"This is a great program for learning photography or brushing up those things that you already knew, but may not have been applying. I am a ""part-time pro"" photographer who does a few jobs for clients a month. I got a lot out of this DVD set, but so did my wife who knew very little about photography before she watched these DVDs. She is actually taking much better pictures now, and enjoying using her camera a lot more. And I am more confident when shooting out in the field for clients. The producers did a great job on this. I recommend it highly.",1196035200,,551,4.3076923076923075
8153148,5,B000JUB2RG,This DVD is a must have for anyone interested in taking better photos. I was able to immediately apply what I leaned and my friends and family couldn't believe how professional my photos looked! Even someone with years of experience will finally be able to learn the secrets professional photographers have known for years but haven't shared until now.,1163116800,,352,4.983050847457627
8153149,5,B000JUB2RG,"Wow! This is what I've been waiting for. Thanks Robert for giving us the ""insider"" photography tips. Changing our mediocre or even awful photo skills into something to be proud of! All of the examples and techniques were not only extremely helpful and easy to remember, but very well put together and simple to understand. I highly recommend it!",1163030400,,345,4.864406779661017
