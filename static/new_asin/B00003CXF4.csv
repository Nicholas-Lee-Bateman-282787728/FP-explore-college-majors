1275482,5,B00003CXF4,"I saw this movie at a cinema in Southern California, surrounded by elderly Russian immigrants.  It had such an emotional impact that at least one lady  was overwhelmed and required physical assistance leaving the theatre when  it ended.  ""East-West"" is a stunningly open  Russian/French-produced film about life in post-war USSR.  Although the  characters are composites, the story is based on cruel historical events.  When Stalin ""welcomes back"" all expatriated Russians, Alexei is  overjoyed to leave his long self-exile in France and sail to his beloved  homeland.  Aboard ship, he and his fellow passengers celebrate their  imagined homecoming to the glorious ""Workers' Paradise"".  None of  them has any idea of the brutal changes which have occurred under  ""Uncle Joe's"" regime.  Only betrayal awaits them.  Upon the  instant of their arrival, they are thrust into a nightmare of  totalitarianism from which there is seemingly no escape.  Many of the  returning countrymen are arrested or executed as ""traitors of the  state"".  Alexei, as a physician, is considered valuable and spared,  although his French wife comes under immediate suspicion and surveillance.  How their sudden culture shock, loss of human rights, miserable living  conditions, persecution, and bleak future inexoribly erode their marriage  is heart-breaking.  The film would be overwhelmingly depressing, but love,  hope, heroism, and sacrifice can prevail even under the iron hand of  Stalin.  I highly recommend this video.  Although unflinchingly honest  about the Soviet system, it treats the long-suffering Russian people with  sensitivity and compassion.",965520000,59,1637,5.628099173553719
1275483,5,B00003CXF4,"The story of one family's sacrifices for one another makes you value that which so many of us take for granted.  Not only is this film an excellent recreation of life in Post WWII Russia, but it also has you cheering on the  characters as you follow the story of Alexei, a Russian emmigrant who fled  Russia only to return many years later with his family following the end of  the second World War, Marie, his French wife, and their son.  I appreciated  how the film realistically showed that families weren't perfect, and that  families did not necessarily mean blood relations, but instead those you  loved and cared for.  Catherine Deneuve is as strong as ever as she places  an actress who tries to help Alexei and Marie escape the horrors they find  in Russia.  This film was not suprisingly nominated for Best Foreign Film  1999.  For French speakers, it's easy to follow, despite the captions, and  exciting to watch when you realize how much of the language you can grasp  and understand.  At least, it was for me.  If you want a deeply moving  film, then this is the one for you.",964051200,18,1089,4.549222797927461

1275667,4,B00003CXF4,"After World War II, the USSR ""forgave"" all the ex-patriots who left the country in the 1930s and invited them back.  This is the story of a French woman (Sandrine Bonnaire) who married a Russian and went back with him after WWII.  They discover that (surprise surprise) Stalin lied and invited most of the people back so that he could send them to Siberia.  Bonnaire and her husband avoid that fate, but their apartment is not as nice as the one they had in France.  They have a son.  The son grows up knowing French and how much his mother would like to go back.  That's as much as I can tell without giving away the ending.

1275670,5,B00003CXF4,"East West is an absorbing film that reveals the crude deception of the destiny of many people who returned from France, still believeing that the End of WW2 implied another ambiance in the Stalin Regime.

But then the song of illusions is over when they realize - once more - nothing has changed. A monolithic Government, deaf and unable about human feelings, where the rules dictate all that surround you.

The movie focuses around a young couple who very, very soon realizes about the bitter truth. She - French citizen, married with a Soviet. Hence the nightmare will begin.

A brilliant film, soberly told and better filmed. No tears; the facts will lead you to realize by yourself the Proletarian dream is a captivating jingle for childish adults.

You will feel the meaning of the fist of iron, over and over.

Sandrine Bonnaire, unique in this difficult role, her face becomes a true kaleidsocope of encountered feelings. Oleg Menchikov as his loved husband and the great Catherine Deneuve in a brief but clever role will make you tied to your seat. A marvelous script and the splendid direction by Regis Wargnier makes the rest.

1275671,5,B00003CXF4,"What a powerful film this is!  When I was a child, I was taught by Irish nuns in both Dallas and in Houston, Texas.  The nuns advised us, and this was a very long time ago, never to trust Russia.  I have never forgotten this advice.  I certainly do not want to offend anyone from Russia, but after watching this film, although the setting was long ago, I still will not trust them.",1379462400,,381,4.178082191780822

1275754,2,B00003CXF4,"One can often identify a bad film by a bad sound track.  The music doesn't stink, but it is melodramatic, not memorable ... as, basically the storyline is. Yes, it must have been rather horrible to live in the USSR during the 1930's, but the utter lack of any insight into more underlying causes leaves me feeling like a Marxist film critic. Pretty simple story of good vs. bad, pretty simple use of supporting characters. Pretty simple husband and wife romantic and ideological conflict. Simple + easy = popular. And isn't it a little unrealistic how many of the Russians speak in what sounds to me like fluent impeccable french? Anyway, it could be worst, I don't find anything hillariously bad, the film is worked out fine for me as I used it to improve my knowledge of Russian and French.",1270425600,,792,4.617021276595745
1275755,5,B00003CXF4,"This unforgettable and tragic true story reveals how loving relationships are affected by oppressive governments.  Dictatorships breed deception and chaos.  The movie opens with hopeful Russian emigres returning to Russia, which was then the Soviet Union under Stalin.  Oleg Menshikov and Serge Bodruv, Jr. were brilliant in this movie (sadly, Bodruv was killed in an accident in 2002 while filming another movie), and Catherine Deneuve is well known as an exceptionally fine actress.  I had not seen Sandrine Bonnaire before, but she did a superb job playing the distraught wife of a Soviet doctor, although Soviet against his will. This is one of the great films I've seen in my life.",1249862400,,686,5.153153153153153
1275756,4,B00003CXF4,I thoroughly enjoyed this film set in post war Russia and depicts the diffculty of citizens returning to their native land and the hardship/abuse of immigrants.  This is a riveting tale..,1239235200,,187,5.032258064516129
1275757,3,B00003CXF4,"The aesthetic options this movie takes will make you immerse into the
epoch. From the beginning, when they get down from the ship and the
music and military marches don't sound as they should, but muffled and
empty, you could see reality was going to take its toll on the couple's
dreams.

While quite implausible (Sasha's crossing, Aleksei Golovin getting
scots-free from all he did) the villains are not as dumb and cartoonish
as in other films of, say, Nazy Germany.

Sandrine Bonnaire is fine. Unrecognizable from her half wit Sophie from
La Crmonie (1995) as well as the sleuth in Chabrol's Au coeur du
mensonge, she's radiantly beautiful here. Only later, watching some
scant pictures at IMDb, did I realize that her nose, for instance,
isn't exactly ""nice"". Good for her, her smile erases our rationality
:).

I found the film surprising, specially since the couple of main
characters don't perform according to expectations. Aleksei, while the
honest bright physician, falls in the clutches of a believable Olga (as
Tatiana Doguileva) without much ado. And Marie is not immune to Russian
charm either, forgetting her son at her charge to boot.

What I really didn't like is the heroic format of Catherine Deneuve's
actress turned ""freedom fighter"" Gabrielle Develay. As if the director,
writer etc. had to erase with one elbow what had been (well) written
with the other one, this character comes out of the blue to be the only
""hope of liberty at western capitalism"". As one character says to her:
""You hardly know this person you're risking your life for!"". Besides
the tricks for a Disney movie, the ""last minute efforts"", the stupidest
guards on earth etc, I suspect the KGB didn't run the country or kill
more than 20 million people and could have not realized that, for
instance, once Marie first gave sure signs of ""dissidence"" and then did
what she did (Sasha), she wasn't going to try more mischief. So Sasha's
story, from his swimming talents (like a bad Hollywood movie), the
state official realizing his family had all been traitors and him being
let free to wander in the country, then his standing at the French
Embassy like if somebody in his condition could really barter for
anything (there were millions of people in the same condition).

The dismal housing problems are accurately depicted, as well as the
troubles of ""too many people living under a single roof"". Of course,
like in all big productions, visuals are fine (like Sasha's training at
a beautiful cold river), as the epoch (the buildings, cars, clothing,
the already mentioned crowded flat, even the ""expensive Bulgarian
hotel"" looks, well... Sovietic and fadish!). The opulent interiors shot
in drab color as jotix100 from New York writes at IMDb. Ah, the petty
thiefs who ""find chicken around the corner"" and jewellry from a
relative are sympa, they add some naive contrast to the dire Soviet
conditions. Which were probably many times worse than what the film
dares to show.

All in all, I liked the film. But I feel it lost gravitas and depth due
to concession to the ticket office.",1235347200,,3075,4.869980879541109

1275760,5,B00003CXF4,"Est/Ouest is a wonderful collaboration about the cultural and political clash between the newly emerging Soviet Union and the Western world. In 1946, as a propaganda move, the Soviet government invited back Soviet emigr&eacute;s who had fled to France during the Russian revolution.  The story is of a Soviet doctor, Alexei Golovin, and his French wife, Marie. When they arrive in Odessa, they are met by machine-gun toting soldiers who actually gun down one of the returnees. They are transported to Kiev, where they are allotted one room in a ""boarding house."" Unfortunately for them, Marie is accused of being a capitalist spy, and life quickly goes downhill from there. The movie chronicles their 10 year attempt to flee Russia and get back to the ""Free West"". Movie is in French and Russian, with English subtitles.  This is a very exciting story.

1275761,5,B00003CXF4,"This film in French and Russian language was made to show the story of the state of Russia shortly after WWII.  It starts in year 1946 with a premise that all Russian expatriates living abroad since year 1917 (October Revolution) were invited for re-patriation back to Russia.  We see a group of Russians leaving France with great hopes of reconnecting with their fatherland, offering new government their skills, talents and love for the country in an effort to build a new society after the devastating war.  We know that this bait will end badly from the start.  As these naive citizens step on the Russia soil the tragedy hits: elderly are separated from the young, families are being divided and before we know it a young French man of Russian decent is shot to death from the back by the eager Russian soldier.  Main protagonist of this story is a doctor who with wife and a young son gets rude awakening of what is the future for his family.  Deeply devoted to his wife, he will do whatever it takes top protect his family.  As time passes and the differences and tension between the couple increases, wife is becoming more determined to escape Russian and get back to France.  In the process and circumstances around them, she establishes relationship with a young Russian man who happens to live in the same apartmens with her family.  Without desclosing the plot, we learn about two people so desparate for freedom and nothing to loose that will do anything to reclaim it.  Over a period of 10 years lives of all of them are so profoundly changed that is hard to believe how can anyone endure such oppresion.  It will take another 30 years after their escape until borders are open again and Russian citizens can choose to stay or immigrate to any country of their choice.  See the rest of the movies by the talented Russian director Sergei Bodrov and his son who appears in many of his films, this one included (he had a role of young Russian lodger Sasha).",1201046400,,1968,4.607449856733524

I find it somehow ironic that this lesson on the evils of communism should come from a French-Russian production, and wonder if there are enough gutsy people left in Hollywood who could duplicate this effort considering the current fascination of so many with socialism.",1171929600,,393,4.96969696969697
1275864,5,B00003CXF4,"It's a shame this wonderful film seems to have gone out of print.  Though not based on a true story, there were many people like Dr. Aleksey Golovin and his wife Marie, Sasha Vasiliyev, and Gabrielle living in the decade immediately after WWII.  The film opens with an extended shot panning over the waves, setting up the important recurring motif of water in the story.  A boatload of Russian-born natives are returning to their homeland from France, having accepted the invitation by Stalin to any ex-patriates who left in 1917 to come home, with no hard feelings, and to start over again in rebuilding the nation.  Anyone with even a passing knowledge of Russian history would know they were walking right into a trap, but the people on the boat sincerely believed that things would be different now.  As it turns out, only Aleksey, Marie, and their young son Seryozha are spared execution or imprisonment after debarking, although Marie is initially accused of being a foreign spy.  Immediately she realises that coming there was a mistake, and doesn't seem to fully grasp the danger she's putting herself in by trying to leave or even by thinking she can leave.  She never fully gets used to their life in a cramped apartment in Kiyev, and befriends young Sasha, who moves into their room after the arrest and death of his grandmother Anastasiya, who raised him after his parents were arrested and executed as ""enemies of the people"" a decade earlier.  Sasha, a promising young swimmer, also is longing to escape to freedom in the West, and this idea of freedom is so important to him that he'll go to any lengths to achieve it, even if he might be risking his life.  The Golovins' marriage has become troubled, and after Aleksey has begun an affair with Olga, one of the many people in the apartment, Marie begins her own affair with Sasha, who is over ten years her junior.  (I wish there were more depictions of romances like this in the movies, an older woman with a much-younger man.)  They decide that Sasha will defect first, and then manage to get in touch with Marie's family back in France, who will arrange for her to escape.  They're also being helped by Gabrielle, a left-wing French actress who is touring in the Soviet Union and putting herself on the line as well to help them to escape.  Being the Soviet Union, of course, particularly in this ten-year period after WWII, things don't work out exactly according to their plans, but the dream of freedom remains, and even persecution and a term in the GULAG don't stop Marie's plans to somehow, someday, escape, no matter what the cost.

This film, although it was directed by a Frenchman, really has the feeling of being a Russian film.  The constant fear, paranoia, deprivations, and lack of privacy are keenly felt, as are the working and living conditions in the Soviet Union at this time.  This was also a multi-lingual production; the languages spoken by the cast and crew were French, Russian, Bulgarian, English, and Ukrainian, and most of the film was shot in Kiyev, Ukraine, and Sofia, Bulgaria.  The actors used are also wonderful.  Aleksey is played by Oleg Menshikov, one of the finest young Russian actors working today.  He speaks all of his French lines so well and fluently that one would never suspect, until hearing the audio commentary, that he really had to memorise all of those lines phoenetically and doesn't speak or understand a word of French.  Marie is Sandrine Bonnaire, who is very popular in France and a masterful actor.  Gabrielle is played by Catherine Deneuve, who is quite a legend in France.  And Sasha is played by Sergey Bodrov, Jr., who was one of Russia's best and most popular rising stars in the Nineties and early Aughts.  (He was also quite handsome.)  Sadly, he was killed in an avalanche in September 2002 while shooting his latest movie.  Sergey was very effective and convincing as young Sasha, going through all of the emotions the character had to go through, even when, as is pointed out in the commentary, he had to do something that was totally against his nature in real life, like get really angry and confrontational.  Extras are an audio commentary by director Rgis Wargnier and screenwriter Sergey Bodrov, Sr., trailers, and talent files for Sandrine Bonnaire, Rgis Wargnier, and Catherine Deneuve.  The soundtrack is also incredibly masterful, powerful, and moving.

This is a highly-recommended film for not only those interested in Russian history but also for anyone who appreciates a good suspenseful historical drama.  It's about the lives of individual people and how they were affected by what was going on in the Soviet Union in these terrifying years of stepped-up repression and fear, after the brief lull in terror and paranoia that had taken place during WWII, making daily life in the Soviet Union as tenuous and nightmarish as it had been during the Thirties.  And though it does have many authentic Russian touches, it does have a number of French touches as well, reminding the viewer that it's also the story of a Frenchwoman trapped in a world not her own, something which also gives it a somewhat lighter touch that one might expect from a Russian film.  As the title implies, this film truly is a blending of East and West in more ways than one.",1166659200,5,5296,4.78046103183315
1275865,5,B00003CXF4,"An extraordinary film, East West, brings to the screen the story of a Russian man, his French wife and their young boy, as they are duped by Stalin's regime into immigrating to the USSR shortly after the end of WWII.

Once there, they realize what a mistake they've made with their dreams of a better future shattered and their lives turning into a living hell.

It is a film about human relations, love, hope and inner strength, but most importantly about duty, loyalty, devotion and integrity; qualities that sadly seem to have all but vanished from every day life.  The movie does a great job of describing the inhuman conditions behind the Iron Curtain in that giant gulag known as Stalin's USSR.

Oleg Menshikov, Sandrine Bonnaire, (the late) Sergei Bodrov, Catherine Deneuve, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it combines drama, action, and adventure, making it one of the best films of its kind.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

In short, East West is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

Strongly recommended along with Nikita Mihalkov's Barber of Siberia, starring (also) Oleg Menshikov and Julia Ormond among others!

As for the previous reviewer's (SonyaNatalia) ill-placed/unfortunate comments, what is a Ukrainian nationalist doing in Australia???  Warsaw, Washington or Tel-Aviv are sooo much closer to Kiev... She's a long way from home it seems...",1154563200,,1697,5.115942028985507
1275866,5,B00003CXF4,"The only good anti-communist is a FRENCH anti-Communist...

That's something I've believed since first reading Raymond Aron. This Gallic tradition has continued through Bernard Henry-Levy and now I'm adding French director Regis Wagnier to my list...

The film stars Sandrine Bonnaire and Catherine Deneuve. It's about idealistic Communists who return from Paris to the USSR in 1946 to help build up socialism in the wake of WWII. What they find, instead, is suffering they never imagined.

The film has a certain French quality, especially in the relationships; and yet, there is something Russian there, too. Filmed in Kiev, it really looks Russian, even when the faces seem French. The fear, paranoia, suspicion--even the dancing men of the Red Army Chorus--all very Russian. What's missing is a little bit of Russian warmth, which is somehow found in even the most shocking Russian films. The French are a bit more cerebral and rational, I guess. But the picture packs a wallop, all the same.

I won't spoil it by revealing the plot. At least it has a happy ending (in a really Russian movie, the hero would be shot, I would think).

It is really, really good. And I recommend it. Add it to your own Netflix queue--or buy it from Amazon...",1132963200,,1243,4.9

1275869,4,B00003CXF4,"This film reminded me of going to the zoo.  Here you have a community of individuals that are captured by the thought of a longer life, freedom, and food, only when they arrive (like animals in zoo); they are shocked by the realism that it is not a vacation.  Food will be served at your captor's convenience, your captors determine the chain of command as well, and finally, nobody can leave once they arrive. After WWII, under Stalin's regime, Russia invites all defectors back to their homeland, but it is a trick.  Est-Ouest tells the story of one family's plight to escape a country that has transformed into a wall-less prison.  With the KGB watching their every move, our heroes must risk everything to see the light of freedom once more.  Living in a post 9/11 world, one cannot help but begin to see the similarities between what Alexei and Marie and the Arab world in America.  While not quite as harsh, we constantly are reminded about the vengeful eye of our government and the illustrious Patriot Act.

Est-Ouest is one of those films where you could either be excited and happy by the results or be bursting into an emotional sea of tears.  From the opening credit sequence until the darkened words crept back on the screen, this film captivated me.  With the powerful acting, the intense story, and the brilliant work behind the camera, Est-Ouest will pull hard on your emotions and not release you until the very end.  Director Rgis Wargnier has done a superb job of bringing the history of the characters, as well as the land, straight into your hearts.  He does this with some of the most common techniques and a very simple story.  This is a story about love and freedom.  He uses these simplistic structures to keep us focused on the overall depth and tone of the film.  There is this feeling of being in a non-barred cage, unable to escape, unable to be free due to the vengeful eye of your comrades.  Wargnier forces you to feel for these characters, from the beginning until the end, because they are no different than you are I.  They are placed in a situation like no other, yet somehow so real that we could witness it happen even today.

From our initial meeting with Alexei and Marie on the boat heading to Russia, we are bombarded with a sense of pride, love, and fear all at once.  We are unfamiliar with the relationship between Alexei and Marie, but immediately take it as a loving one.  Perhaps we are too haste with that decision, because as our story unfolds, as does the bond that connects these two individuals ... or at least that is what Wargnier would like us to think.  Est-Ouest is more than just a story about escaping to freedom, it is a contrast between patience and immediate self-sacrifice.  Marie wants to escape the cold world they inhabit immediately, she wants to see Paris again and taste its freedom, while Alexei does as well, just not quite as quickly.  He understands the rules of the nation, and slowly sets in motion a plan that will give his wife all that he has promised.  It took me until the end of the film to see this contrast between immediate escape and patience.  While I thought that it was a great message to show, I felt as if the timing was a bit off throughout the film.  I had trouble following the timeline, while I did realize that several years had passed between these horrific events, the only person that seemed to age was Alexei's son.  I needed a stronger connection between these riveting scenes so that I could keep track in my mind the time that had passed.

The acting was gorgeous. Oleg Menshikov and Sandrine Bonnaire had such a powerful connection on screen that I could not keep my eyes off them.  When they were together you wanted them to be, and when they were apart, you dreamt of them being back together.  You cannot say that of many film characters.  The late Sergei Bodrov Jr. reminded me of a Russian Brad Pitt.  The way he carried himself and acted in this film was similar to that of Mr. Pitt.  Together these three key players brought this film to life.  While somehow Catherine Deneuve received top billing as well, she didn't seem to carry as much of the weight that I had hoped that she would.  While she was vital to the story, I felt she could have brought more to her character.  The depth behind her words just wasn't there or just didn't seem to match the emotion of everyone else.

The only other negative aspect that I have with this film was that I felt the story seemed incomplete.  There were moments where we were given a nibble to enjoy, but never fully developed those nibbles into bites.  There were elements of the story that needed to be developed further, such as the relationship between Sasha and Marie.  While I did see some evolution when they were in Russia, it was later that I needed the follow-up.  It just felt as if some strings were not tied at the end, but instead left frayed with questions looming in the air.

Overall, I thought this was a very tight drama.  There were some flaws with may have caused it to loose its Oscar win in 1999, but nonetheless, the good did outweigh the bad.  The characters were intense, the story (outside of the loose ends) was captivating, and being able to see a darker side of the world was thrilling.  Simply put, this was a story about freedom and love, and those are themes that transcend throughout history.  Est-Ouest is a story for seeing the destructive nature of Stalinism and its impact on humanity.

1275870,4,B00003CXF4,"Yes this is a good movie, and all the other positive comments. But what I find unique in East-West is the tangible sense of the foreboding, the sinister, the fearful undercurrent of distrust and danger that surely pervaded every encounter one had with others under the Soviet regime. The constant awareness that the next moment may find oneself whisked off to the Gulag, or one's loved ones seen never again. In many movies you can see the actors with this sense; in this movie you feel it yourself. For all of us who can hardly avoid taking freedom for granted, this needs to be felt.",1105488000,4,585,4.580952380952381

However, great ambitions are quickly dashed, especially for one young couple, who find Stalinist Russia to be particularly brutal.  Oleg Menshikov plays a young doctor who returns with his French wife, Marie (evocatively portrayed by Sandrine Bonnaire).  There are shades of Doctor Zhivago here, but the film moves along at its own lugibrious pace, as it develops Alexei's growing detachment from his wife and his wife's interest in a young swimmer, played by Sergei Bodrov, who is as stone-faced as ever.  Wargnier doesn't have much of a feel for Soviet Russia.  One sees a bit too much of the Cold War paradigm in this movie, as ultimately Marie plots her escape, with the aid of a French actress (Catherine Deneuve) who empathizes with her situation.

The accusation that the plot is ""soap opera"" is totally specious and Maltin is completely jaded. The acting here is absolutely outstanding with Sandrine Bonnaire giving a sterling performance, and she does not look glamorous for most of it! The other actors, like Oleg Mechikov...but also even the minor roles, are terrific and the story is riveting. It's hilarious that a previous (anonymous) reviewer thought the story ""eurocentric"" and that all the Russians appear bad. This is completely inaccurate, and is he/she denying that Stalin's Russia was pretty much like this? After all he is the greatest murderer in history!

It actually, does the opposite, by highlighting human spirit under duress and telling how much the Russians had to endure and yet preserved their culture and humanity. The coach is one type of Russians who helped the society to move forward. The movie made me think that Soviet Union - the country I lived in 70-ies and 80-ies had much in common with the post-war Stalinist society, from which it just gradually evolved before the perestroika. It also, helped me appreciate more the value of freedoms I gained in the end of 80-ies in Russia under Gorbachev and those I gained later by moving to the West.",1074297600,3,759,4.467625899280575
1275946,5,B00003CXF4,"You'd never guess it from the usual misleading US release VHS/DVD cover box, but this movie is all about Oleg Menchikov's incredible lead performance.  Yet, he's pushed far into the background on the cover, with Catherine Deneuve's beautiful face taking up at least 50% of the montage.
However, those looking for a good Catherine Deneuve movie may be in for a disappointment.  While her role is certainly vital, her screen time is about 10% of the film, at the most.
The story is what drives this film.  It seems incredible...too bleak and far-fetched to be real; but, the story is based on real events.  Menchikov's performance is what seals the deal.  I had seen him excel in the Academy Award-winning ""Burnt By the Sun,"" and figured he was worth another shot.
And how.  Just when you think you've got him figured out here - he reveals his hand to fool everyone in the film...as well as everyone watching.  It's a spine-tingling cinematic moment.
This is far from a light, pick-me-up type of film.  But if you're in the mood for an intelligent, well-made film - that imparts some real historical lessons in the process - then you can't do any better than 'East-West.'",1055980800,2,1169,4.724137931034483
1275947,5,B00003CXF4,"Nominated for an Academy Award in 2000 as Best Foreign Film, this is a rather bleak story of a couple caught in the winds of Stalinism.  The year is 1946.  He's a Russian doctor and happily married to a French wife. They've been living in France.  But now they learn that Stalin has invited all Russian migrs to come back to the great Soviet Union.  They decide to go with their young son.
From the moment they set foot in Russia, it's horror all the way.  They've been tricked.  Most of the migrs are executed.  But the doctor and his family are spared because his profession is essential to the country.  They are forced to live as other Russians do now - in a small apartment with four other families.  They are constantly watched.  And the French wife is treated suspiciously because she is a foreigner.  Life is hard, not only because some basic necessities are no longer there, but mostly because of the lack of privacy and the constant harassment.  There are strains on their marriage.  They argue.  They make up.  They both get involved romantically with others.  Life goes on.
Sandrine Bonnaire is cast as the wife. Oleg Menchikov is the husband.  And Catherine Deneuve is cast as a traveling French actress who does what she can to help the couple. Years pass. A young swimmer escapes the Soviet Union with the wife's help.  Punishment follows.  The audience sees the physical changes in the couple, a spirit of resignation.  But yet there is still hope to get out.  How this all plays out keeps the tension high as we follow the couple over a lifetime.  It's all very sad.  And very interesting.
I enjoyed the snapshot of life in the Soviet Union because I had never seen it depicted so clearly before.  And the acting and  cinematography was consistently good.  The screenplay held it all together and I was never bored.
The DVD didn't have extra features but the transfer was good and the subtitles in French and Russian easy to read.  I felt like I somehow became a fly on the wall of this couple's home.  It was not a pleasant experience. I loved this film but it certainly isn't for everyone.",1051315200,3,2108,4.549333333333333

That is the basic premise of the movie: immigrants returning to the Soviet Union to live in what they believe in now a changed country. Alas, change is apparent, but that isn't the kind of change they were looking for. Years and years of struggle, inability to change their life or get out of the country once they were allowed in - you don't want to try it yourself, but watching this movie helps you realize how many things you take for granted on a daily basis.",1017619200,5,650,4.470588235294118
1275949,4,B00003CXF4,"Though ""East-West"" (originally ""Est-Ouest"") looks very political at first sight, the fact is that it handles with much universal theme, which surely moved the voters of the Academy and the Golden Globe Award to give it a deserved nomination for Best Foreign Film in 2000.  For all its apparent flaws, the film does not fail to move your heart in the end, making you think about how much people can take under the severest conditions to protect what you love.
After WW2, many exiles from Russia came back to their native country, and among them a doctor Alexei (Oleg
Menchikov, popular Russian actor) and his wife Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire).  But as they land on the harbor of Odessa, they learn that everything is a lie.  Deprived of her passport, and suspected as a spy sent from the West, Marie decides to return to France.  While she survives the unhappy life in Kiev, being gradually estranged from Alexei, and her secret plans all end in disastrous results, her husband seeks for another solution.  It soon becomes clear to them that it takes much longer time than they first expected.
""East-West"" at its best shows the assured view on a family in this extreme situation, and their reaction to the harsh moment of reality.  Real history gives strong support as a backgraond, but what we are impressed with is Marie's desperate and even manipulating ways of facing the reality, and Alexei's more comlicated, apparently cowardly action to autocratic rules during the Cold War.  The changing relations between the husband and the wife is fastened by Bonnaire's strong performance, which suitably matches Menchikov's seemingly calm, resigned face.  Those two actors with a good story is the best virture of the film.
There are flaws in this film, some say, and in fact the script seems sometimes melodramatic.  Some reviewers might complain the loss of credibility at several points, but as I don't know much about the facts about the historical events, I can't criticize those moments when we see a Russian soldier killing an innocent victim on the spot at Odessa, or a KGB officier torturing Marie tearing her passport apart.  It is certain that Russian bureaucrats look like caricature, but how could I know?  Let me say this way: the film IS melodramatic, but for all that the film does not fail to grab your heart.
Whatever the complaint may be, the last scene pays off.  And pays off very much.  The film might have been better if it had taken a little longer time to bring everything to this conclusion.  (I imagined there might be a longer director's cut somewhere in studio.)  But, remember, the emotional power of ""East-West"" is beyond a doubt.  Helped by the grand score of Patrick Doyle (""Bridget Jones' Diary"" ""Sense and Sensibility"") and moody photography of Laurent Dailland, ""East-West"" is a triumph.
A Russian swimmer Sacha, one of the key characters of the film, is played by Serguei Bodrov Jr., son of Serguei Bodrov, co-writer of this film and director of ""Prisoner of the Mountains"" and ""The Quickie.""",1014508800,11,3022,4.873046875

There is much pathos to the tale, but it's also a heart-pounding thriller at times. I haven't been so caught up in a film in many years.
The cinematography (Laurent Daillant) is terrific and the score (Patrick Doyle) gorgeous. The cast, down to the last bit player is exceptional. Sandrine Bonnaire and Serguei Bodrov Jr. are absolutely superb, and Oleg Menchikov ! He was fabulous in ""Prisoner of the Mountains"" and ""Burnt by the Sun"", but here gives a subtle, many layered portrait of a man trapped by fate...perhaps his best and most astounding performance of all.
A complex story that spans a decade, the editing is so good that the pieces fit seamlessly and the pacing flows...however, it's a film that should be seen more than once, as a lot falls into place on subsequent viewings.
This is one I'm glad I own...for its glimpse into a period of history, its brilliant performances, and the sheer beauty of what a film can be when at its best. It's about freedom, the will to survive, and most of all, about a man's love that goes beyond his own needs.",1014249600,7,1282,4.62719298245614

There has always been a certain romantic intrigue about the Soviet Union and Russia. Mother Russia serves the perfect foil against any love story. The uncertainty of living in a place filled with turmoil and secrets.
The story of Alexi and Marie is powerful. Their love - and what they do for that love - is humbling. Astonishing.
I enjoyed the ending, as well. Instead of leaving the viewers with the bittersweet taste of love lost, Mr. Wargnier manages to end this movie on a joyful note.
This movie is a joy for the senses. The scenery and costumes are, at least to my novice eye, well done. The language shifts frequently from Russian to French, while you read the subtitles.

1276044,5,B00003CXF4,"It's 1946, and Josef Stalin opens the Soviets borders to all Russian expatriates who've left since 1917, and who might wish to return to rebuild the Motherland in a burst of patriotic fervor. Alexei, a Russian practicing medicine in France, decides to accept the offer, and is accompanied by his trusting Parisian wife, Marie, and their son, Sergei. There's singing and goodwill aboard the ship bound for Odessa, but ... uh-oh ... those aren't beribboned girls bearing flowers on the quay when the ship docks. Those are soldiers and commissars, and the expats are divided ... some to the left, some to the right ... to be subsequently interrogated, charged as imperialist spies, or even shot. Welcome home to Mother Russia, comrades!
Alexei and his family are transported to Kiev, where they live in a crowded collective tenement with thin walls and friendly, but watchful, locals. (The aging and sympathetic babushka serving as house supervisor is soon hauled off by local police muscle for speaking French to Marie. So much for a carefree atmosphere.) Sergei is assigned to a local factory to look after the workers' health. Marie irons shirts for the Soviet Army Chorus, Band and Dance Ensemble. Thus begins a decade-long dream of escape back to France.
EAST-WEST stars Oleg Menchikov as Alexei, who, being Russian, realizes the only way to remedy his poor choice of family outings is to work surreptitiously and slowly within the system. Marie, played by Sandrine Bonnaire, being  more impatient and less subtle, is constantly rocking the boat with her self-centered breakout schemes. Both Oleg and Sandrine are wonderful in their respective parts, as are Serguei Bodrov, Jr. and Catherine Deneuve as the Russian swimmer Sacha and left-wing French actress Gabrielle respectively, who are the family's tenuous links to the West. And the scruffy KGB heavy, Pirogev, is particularly poisonous.
EAST-WEST is a powerful look at the aftermath of a bad career decision, and the moral compromises, personal betrayals, and emotional traumas that accompany the effort to set things right again. But, there are also love, devotion, courage, and self-sacrifice. At the beginning of the film, as Alexei and his family take dubious survey of their new Kiev residence, Marie asks Sergei, ""What does a traveler need?""
""Strength, and courage.""",992131200,5,2330,5.180371352785146
1276045,4,B00003CXF4,"At the close of World War Two, a number of Communist fellow-travellers in the West chose to accept Josef Stalin's invitation to resettle in the worker's paradise of the Soviet Union and learned that Uncle Joe's definition of ""paradise"" was a bit different than their own.
In ""East-West"", a Russian man brings his French wife and young son back to Odessa to begin a new life.  There is great revelry and a bit of nervous tension among the group on the voyage, but a general lighthearted optimism prevails.  The mood shifts when the passengers debark in Odessa, are immediately accused of being spies, and marched off to an uncertain fate.
Alexei, the husband and father of our emigres from France, is a doctor and quite savvy politically.  He realizes almost admittedly his foolishness in returning to the Soviet Union and immediately takes steps to ensure his family's survival. His wife, Marie, is a different sort, and she feels betrayed by her husband for convincing her to leave France and come to this horrible, paranoid place.  She begins plotting to escape Russia with her son.
""East-West"" is quite a unique movie for American audiences.  Despite the European view that Americans are reflexively anti-Communist, this movie could never be made in Hollywood, where socialist ideals run deep.  The only serious anti-Communist movie I can recall since World War II (sorry, ""Red Dawn"" fans) is Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"", and his reception among the glitterati for this was frigid at best.  On the other hand, how many anti-Nazi movies have there been?  It's an odd dichotomy, unless one reflects how many card-carrying Communists there are in Tinseltown and how few Voelkischer Beobachter (the Nazi party paper) subscribers there were.
The French have proven in recent years that they are superior in at least one regard to their American counterparts (all right, they're also far better at surrendering): they are able to view the legacy of Communism without flinching.  Having produced ""The Black Book of Communism"" and ""East-West"", I may have to reconsider my predisposition toward despising all things French, save Latitia Costa.
This movie is subtitled, so illiterates should purchase ""Big Daddy"" instead.",980035200,18,2219,5.124653739612189

When I came out of the movie theater, I was drained, was dazed from the epic that I had just watched. The movie takes place in 1945, after the end of WWII when Russia issued an annoucement for Russian emigres in the West to return home, and nothing would be done against them. The Communists said to all returning people's, that they would have a wonderful life, and jobs in the Soviet Union. Alexi is a Russian who went to France and married his French wife Marie. They return with their son, but have no idea at all things would be that way. As soon as they dock in Odessa, the group from the ship is either executed or imprisoned. They are lucky and get to Kiev. Marie wants to get out soon after they arrive. As it happens she lives there for 10 years, with much difficulties, problems, and life altering changes.

1276047,4,B00003CXF4,"Like ""The Thief"" (1997), which was also nominated for a best foreign-language film Oscar, Regis Wargnier's ""East-West"" is a turbulent romance set against the political backdrop of post-World War II Russia. But instead of a man, a woman, and a child, the story revolves around a man, a woman, a child--and another man.

Shortly after the war, Alexei (Oleg Menshikov, ""Prisoner of the Mountains""), his wife Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire), and their son travel to Russia from France to make a new life for themselves. They quickly find that the situation in Alexei's homeland isn't quite as advertised and that they can't leave. Sacha (Sergie Bodrov, Jr., ""Brother"") is a young athlete who lives in the same overcrowded apartment complex. Like Marie, he longs to escape, while Alexei appears to have decided to make the best out of an awful situation. Inevitably, Marie and Alexei grow apart as Sacha and Marie grow close, but one of the three is harboring a secret that won't be revealed until the end.

The film does double-time as a thriller in that, at any time, any of these characters could be imprisoned or killed--including French actress, Gabrielle (Catherine Deneuve, star of Wargnier's Oscar-winning ""Indochine""). She befriends Marie during a tour of Russia and offers to help her and Sacha make their getaway.

At its worst, ""East-West"" threatens to strain credibility, but Wargnier's assured direction and the sympathetic performances he elicits from his first-rate cast make for a believable and compelling drama. Although not an epic on the scale of David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago,"" Wargnier takes a more intimate approach to similar subject matter and, arguably, offers the superior bittersweet conclusion.",978566400,2,1712,5.218181818181818

The man, far from being an idiot, loves his wife and child more than his own life and asperations.  He seeks to find a way, to remove his family from this tragically sick, insane environment.

Like their cousins the Nazis, communists believed  that if you smash culture (no more dead white males, anyone?) and society (family, courtesy, chivalry, faith) to bits and scrap archaic notions like truth and respect for human dignity you can build Utopia. The death toll of the various communist societies totaled something on the order of a tenth of a billion people. The cost to the human spirit of those forced to live under this horrid system is beyond calculation. By focussing on the tale of a French woman whose idiot husband believed the lies of the Soviet government and transported her and her child into this hell, we feel the full impact of the assault. The kind old Russian lady who is dragged off by the secret police after she is overheard speaking French and is next seen in her coffin makes the point of what happens in such a system when individuals deviate, however slightly, from mandated norms of political correctness.",976320000,6,1097,4.866310160427807
