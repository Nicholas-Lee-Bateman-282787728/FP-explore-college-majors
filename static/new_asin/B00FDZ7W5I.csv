5978582,3,B00FDZ7W5I,"John Wayne 20 Movie Pack

This collection of mostly old monochrome movies from the 1930s stars John Wayne in his early acting days before he was one of the better known actors in Western movies. He also played in other movies. Many of the western movies of this era portrayed the struggles of small ranchers and farmers against the big landowners of that era. These stories are based on historical events mostly censored from schoolbooks. The Johnson County War was the inspiration for many of these stories, as well as the Lincoln County War. These four single-sided DVDs are mostly `Budget pictures'. They are the equivalent of the TV shows of today. Wayne worked as a property man before he became an actor. Many of these movies were shown on TV in the early 1950s. Are they more entertaining than the current shows on TV? Mike Tomkies book ""Duke"" tells about his acting career.
