1810027,1,B00007G1YA,"With the exception of ""Demons"" and maybe ""Demons 2"", all these Italian horror films just do not impress me.
The acting is always poor, the zombies or monsters always look fake, the stories are very hard to follow, or too boring to even care..and the dubbing is terrible.
Black Demons has everything that i mentioned above and more..no suspense, no horror or scary moments in the film, no good looking women (that's a surprize being an italian film)and the soundtrack in the movie is horrible.
Zombie fans...Even if you saw every zombie movie there is, good or bad, this STILL should NOT be on your list of movies-to-watch!",1090281600,,622,4.768518518518518
1810028,3,B00007G1YA,"Unlike everyone else I actually thought this was rather a good, spooky little film, almost a fable.  The resurrected slaves thirsting for revenge are disturbing and there are quite a few tense moments as they (very very slowly) pursue our hapless protagonists round a secluded plantation house.  The Macumba backdrop and Brazilian setting are effective and atmospheric, and the ritual music sounded very authentic to me.  The film has a somewhat dreamlike aspect, (though this is mainly due to inert pacing).  There are a good few minuses in addition to the poor pacing: the zombies are dispatched with desultory ease in the last reel; the acting is generally very poor - tho it  might have been better if Mr Lenzi had allowed his actors a second take in scenes where they fluffed their lines! - and the gore effects are also poor and unimaginative.  Or I should say 'effect', singular - an unconvincing eyeball-gouging done to a very rubbery fake head in extreme close up.  And why do the (blinded) slaves stop at one eye each time?  The characters display little commonsense at any point in the narrative; even when one of the girls is confronted by an axe-wielding zombie (having wandered off into the forest 'for a walk'), the others refuse to take their plight seriously:  'Perhaps you  just imagined it,' they suggest to her after she has returned, implausibly.  The dialogue is annoyingly muffled and far back in the mix, and then the music blares out very loudly indeed, making it an unsatisfactory late-night watch if you have thin walls & don't like annoying the neighbours, though on the plus side, the widescreen transfer is good-quality.  But still, for all its shortcomings, I thought it had an atmosphere in common not so much with Romero et al as with earlier (and rather better) Voodoo-themed movies such as White Zombie and I Walked With A Zombie.",1078185600,3,1865,4.848580441640379
1810029,1,B00007G1YA,"Italian horror films are either really good or really bad, and the really bad ones are really entertaining for laughs or just painful to watch. This is one of the worst of the bad. Not even good to laugh at. Its more poor acting, more poor special effects, and more poor directing. This was released as Demoni 3 in Italy (a supposed sequel to Lamberto Bava's Demoni and Demoni 2), but don't let that trick you into buying this garbage. Only for the most die hard Italian Horror fanatic.",1067817600,,486,4.47191011235955
1810030,1,B00007G1YA,"this is suppose to be a sequel to the cult hits DEMONS 1 and DEMONS 2 but i would not consider this a sequel at all!!  demons 1 and 2 were both great movies in my opinion and are worth checking out but black demons is truly horrible!  very very very slow paced movie with hardly any action or victims.  takes forever for anything to happen in the film.  from looking at the cover i thought at least there would be a high body count or some creative kills or anything for that matter but there wasn't.
this is a must avoid movie unless your lookin for somethin to kill time i suppose, i was very disappointed!",1050710400,3,608,4.170940170940171
1810031,3,B00007G1YA,"cool italian zombie film from the early 90's made in the spirit of the late 70's/early 80's gore heyday.these particular zombies are former black slaves,which is a different spin in this genre.i really liked the make up and atmosphere of their scenes.on the other hand,most of the ""acting"" is atrocious(not unique to italian horror by any means),thus the 3 star rating.if you are an established italian horror film fan,add one star and consider this for your collection.",1048982400,9,470,5.116883116883117
7976410,3,B00007G1YA,"Ok always wanted to see this film  now i did hmm what can i say it kinda reminds me of sugar hill from 1974 but this is a 90s film in a kinda classic Italian zombie style,,  we got zombies, eye riping out scenes hachets in head,,,,,,

my copy has a sound level issue not sure if they all do but just turn it up be ok if it is on yours,, the acting is well see the 3 stars.

Umberto Lenzi claimed in interviews it was one of his favorite films, but he felt it was ruined by some of the actors he was forced to work with, i have to agree  the acting wasn't the best for sure, but i seen worse acting.
he also did Nightmare City with way way better actors and it is a good zombie gore film too.

Its not bad its a good film for your collection but i suspect it will never beat out Zombi by fuchi doe lol",1481155200,,800,3.7604790419161676
7976411,4,B00007G1YA,"I'm a little shocked this film has so much negative hate towards it
Grant it it's not perfect I understand that but, in god's honest truth it's a very unique different type Zombie Film
It's simple but, fun and enjoyable
The film was made when The Horror Genre was almost dead globally
That to could be why it was shot with very little money at this time it was super hard to get finance for any type of horror film
the locations are really good, not sure what was real and what was sets (many of the extras to seem way to real which also makes me wonder) If some of this was Gonzo Film making at it's best
Umberto Lenzi has a eye for directing
I'm pretty sure he had very to little to no money when he filmed this
3 American Students are traveling through Brazil  plantation
Sonia Curtis  (Jessica)  she also had a role in Monster Squad
I liked her she's attractive very girl next door and does the best she can!
Joe Balogh  (Dick) Jessica's Brother he has a strange role to say the least
he is in many ways the real bad guy through the films since he starts the chain of events in the film
He's performance is downright creepy at times
Keith Van Hoven  (Kevin)  Jessica's boyfriend til the end
Dick goes and watches a real life voodoo ritual  (This scene looks authentic) being a complete typical selfish american he records
the ritual..... why you ask why not!  cause that's not creepy
Then Dick comes across a grave site where a handful of slaves are buried
he figures now is a good time to play that recording to the dead slaves
he plays the recording which brings all the dead slaves back to life and they are angry
These ain't everyday Romero Zombies these zombies are walking around with weapons in hand!! (Much Like in Nightmare City)
The Slave Zombies start killing everybody
In a kinds of interesting gory ways

It's a simple Voodoo film with Slaves coming back to life killing helpless victims
Most of the F/X Gore is pretty good considering all the negatives the director and crew had to deal with

It's a very quick 88min. of Italian Horror/Gore
It's also very interesting to view this as a time capsule to where horror has gone (1991 Slasher State Side were pretty much already Burned-out)
In Italy  the horror genre  too was dying out to
It's very sad
The bare bone price now around $6.00 is without a doubt a steal I over payed like $18.00 for the same DVD at Best Buy years ago when BB actually had  cool Rare dvd's
Overall it's a real hidden gem that any horror fan should add to there Collection just cause it was so rare for so long
Up until the dvd boom
7.5/10
I would love to see US Distributor Scream Factory or UK's Arrow Video do a proper Collector Edition Blu Ray of this film
this film deserves a spotlight on it this time period in Horror was flat out fascinating it was a very dark time due to the over fluctuation of the genre itself......",1441152000,,2869,4.34018691588785
7976412,3,B00007G1YA,"Umberto Lenzi seemed confused with whether he was making a Zombie or Demon movie here. Black Demons is shot in Brazil with an English-speaking cast. Some good moments of graphic gore punctuate long moments of tedium concerning three tourists who battle an army (actually six) of living dead black slaves who were killed on a plantation which has had a curse placed upon it.
There's a tacky song about 'breaking chains' and the rest of the music sounds like it belongs in one of Charles Band's Full Moon movies than an Italian zombie flick.

Nothing to do with Lamberto Bava's Demons movies, despite being marketed as Demons 3 in some countries. Bava's own film The Ogre also had a Demons III alternative name slapped on it.

Shriek Show provide a good anamorphic print and Lenzi's interview attempts to introduce some deep racial statement into the film as he did with Cannibal Ferox (apparently!). Still all that feel-good liberalism doesn't prevent him killing a couple of chickens for the voodoo rites in this movie. I guess equality doesn't extend to animals.",1424044800,,1063,4.9
7976413,2,B00007G1YA,An interesting idea that turns out to be a not so great movie. The zombie are so slow that you could walk away from them. My best advice is to walk away from this movie.,1396742400,,169,3.857142857142857
7976414,3,B00007G1YA,"The movie is a great concept, but had poor execution. Three tourists are vacationing in Brazil, one of which is interested in its voodoo practices. He records a ceremony and later plays it at a cemetery at a plantation where they are subsequently stranded. The slaves who were hung by their masters come back to life and seek vengeance. The reanimated corpses are very well preserved for having been dead for so long.

The acting was on par with other Italian zombie movies, which means it was bad. The vehicle had a distributor cap problem which means sometimes the vehicle worked sometimes it didn't. Normally you can fix that problem by drying out the inside of a crack cap, cleaning the contacts and gluing the cracks, otherwise you end up with a situation where the vehicle only works when the writer of the script wants it to.

No f-bombs, no sex, very brief nudity (dancer).",1313971200,3,881,4.67741935483871
7976415,2,B00007G1YA,"Umberto Lenzi is a fine director.  He made some excellent movies that
I would put high on the list of italian movies and grade b movies.
Some of them are even classics like 'milano rovente"" , ""almost human""
""eyeball"" ,
""seven blood stained orchids""  , and the ""cynic , the rat and the fist""
his cannibal movies and even all cannibal movies are a acquired taste but his were among the best.  But by the late 80's he had fallen on hard times.  This movie is not very good and it is slow paced but it's not the worst movie ever made.  I can barely  recommend this one for lenzi fans and zombie completist fans.  But I can't understand why shriek show media blasters would do this movie before a great giallo classic like lenzi's
""Eyeball""  or his many crime movies from the seventies.  THose were all great flicks.  This one though can be added to the many bad zombie flicks out there.  One thing in lenzi's defense at this time he had a hard time getting any financing for movies and had to do what he could.  But many good directors make subpar efforts and this is one of those.  Just give lenzi a chance on some of his other movies. I enjoyed this movie because I like most bad horror movies , good ones are more fun though,  but lenzi's ""nightmare city"" is a good zombie movie , it shows a director
who can deliver and this movie showcases the fall of a good director.  He needs to come out of retirement and make a solid giallo again or something.  And shriek show needs to put out 'eyeball""  to make up for putting this out first.",1224633600,,1533,4.267361111111111
7976416,3,B00007G1YA,"The title of this movie would be considered ""politically incorrect"" today. Technonlogy has advanced so much since this movie was made. This movie is actually entertaining. It has several elements that I always like: a limited cast, a remote location, a simple plot and limited killing. I  could have done without the eye gouging. It was unnecesssary. The bombing of the zombies was so fake, yet the movie never failed to keep my attention. I, being a hopeless romantic, love it when a ""Jack and Jill"" couple survive after going through ""the storm"". This is a solid 3-star movie with a good story. No one will argue that this movie desrves an Oscar for anything, but it is not a waste.",1172793600,,684,4.652892561983471
7976417,1,B00007G1YA,"i had read countless reveiws of black demons before i bought it. the bad bad reviews made it sound really bad, the good reviews made it sound really good. after ordering it i eagerly awaited its arival.i remember the day i came home and saw the white box inside my mail box. i ran inside, grabed a knife and cut the sucker open. i pulled the shiny case out and admired the interesting artwork. i ran into my bedroom and threw the dvd into my player. i pushed play and began watching. 90 minutes later i had decided that i should have stabbed my self with the knife rather than used it to open the box containing what is the most boring and pointless movie ive ever seen. boy oh boy i should have listened to those bad reveiws instead of spending $14 on this crapfest. all you need to know about the plot is that the corpses of slaves come back to life due to some voodoo spell and seek revenge. trust me, sfter 40 of bordom all youll want to know about this films plot is when it ends. black demons feels like an american tv movie. the only good thing about black demons 3 slightly enjoyable gore scenes. i expected much better, especially from umberto lenzi who has never dissapointed before except with cannibal ferox. black demons is a boring, tedius, and down right stupid movie. avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1163721600,2,1316,4.419753086419753
7976418,1,B00007G1YA,"Lenzi's only good movie is Nightmare City.  Watching this giant bore makes you realize the comparitively greater talent of directors such as Fulci and Romero.  A boring film: lackluster acting, plot, and zombies.",1111881600,,212,5.393939393939394
7976419,4,B00007G1YA,"the horrid acting from 95% of the cast would have destroyed this film if it didn't have anything else going for it but UMBERTO LENZI is the director so i promise u its worth your while! Lenzi gives us some really spooky atmosphere & score/some errie visions/some classic gore scenes/some Lenzi'ish good artistic camera direction/ & most of all some very original creepy looking ZOMBIES! i mean it when i say original & unique these zombies stalk there prey like a slasher killer. they don't want brains they don't even want to eat humans period these zombies are on a personel murder mission & believe me they pretty much suceed!!!!! anway i love this cheezzy good/bad zombie flick simpley because i love the cannibal god himself UMBERTO LENZI & his unique/fun take on zombies!!! p.s. fellow horror fans if u find this flick any fun u will love UMBERTO LENZI'S ""NIGHTMARE CITY"" he says its not supposed to be a ZOMBIE flick but us true zombie heads have taken it in as another great unique take on an everlasting genre!!!!!!!!!!! later on fellow horror fans!!!!!!!!!!!!",1094688000,5,1069,4.783783783783784
