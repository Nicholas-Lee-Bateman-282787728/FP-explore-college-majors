1624684,5,B00005M20C,"I am not really into horror movies but I find this one different. It is based on a story by Gogol (early 19 cent. Russian writer, Pushkin thought highly of him) who was inspired by Ukranian folklore. Excellent family watching (esp. for a Halloween night). I think it might be reasonably approprate for kids (9 and up, or as soon as they are OK with witches). In fact, this movie was distributed in Moscow (in 70's) through a chain of ""movie-theathers for kids"".
The movie starts more like a comedy (vacation-bound semenarists mob streat vendors and grab passing girls while running from an Orthodox monastery). The movie gives excellent snap-shots of life in a Ukranian village 200 years ago. An atmosphere of that time is masterfully created. Gradually, the movie shifts towards ""horror"" as the story line develops around a young seminarist (Khoma). He is forced to come to a small village to pray for three nights over a body of a beautiful maiden who died under misterious circumstances. Each night Khoma is locked in an old wooden church where he gets all sorts of ""visitors""... The maiden turned out to be a witch who had some old accounts with Khoma.
Nice acting and directing (Ptushko's movies got a number of awards at Cannes). Some special effects, e.g. flying coffin, are quite good (especially considering that the movie was made in the 60's)... However, true ""horror"" enthusiasts might be somewhat dissappointed by the very final scene where the witch summons Viy (a version of Devil) to haunt Khoma. The authors would probably come up with a more convincing Devil in the current age of computer graphics.
Special thanks to RUSCICO who produced this excellent DVD for Image Entertainment. The movie is digitally restored. Picture and colors are great. 5.1 surround sound was a surprise.",1012867200,26,1798,4.917763157894737
1624689,5,B00005M20C,"I had been waiting to see it for so many years. The transfer to DVD was very good, considering it was made in 1967. I had seen many kinds of all kinds of foreign movies, both new and old or antique. This movie was made so good, it even captured the right atmosphere for the movie. I love it! When I think of the new Viy that supposed to come out in 2010 I say Umm and yummy. After watching this film I know that I need, I must buy the Gogol's book. This is overall excellent. And honestly, English subtitles do no justice to the spoken old Russian language. If you understand it, it must be seen in Russian only.",1316995200,,612,4.066115702479339
1624690,4,B00005M20C,"Other reviewers have covered the main attraction, and at least one has mentioned this extra feature but I wanted to draw more attention to one of the special features that Ruscico has buried in their confusing menus. In addition to ""The Portrait,"" there are two other silent movies made between 1916 and 1918. One is Pushkin's ""The Queen of Spades,"" but the real gem is ""Satan Exultant,"" an 18-minute depiction of a cape-twirling, sneering Prince of Darkness come down to earth to corrupt a pastor and his family. Really, how can you go wrong when the opening title card gives us the Russian equivalent of ""It was a dark and stormy night""? Genius. And no conventional silent-movie piano background music for our boys, the soundtrack consists of the soothing sound of amplified movie projector film.
The vintage Soviet documentary walks us through Gogol's life and haunts with plenty of shots of manuscripts, vintage illustrations, and even a film clip from a Ukrainian opera based on one of Gogol's tales.
The movie itself is atmospheric and fun for its cheesy special effects, but for my money the extras are the best part of the package.",1252022400,3,1139,4.876288659793815
1624691,4,B00005M20C,"Viy (Konstantin Yershov, 1967)

Some movies are just too weird to explain, and yet it is the lot of the hapless reviewer that we must try. Such a film is Viy, a Russian film from the sixties (currently being remade by Oleg Stepchenko, by the by, not that we'll ever get a chance to see it in America) that looks for all the world like a Roger Corman monster flick directed by Eisenstein, with someone very, very drunk in charge of the special effects. (Come to think of it, most of Corman's films... oh, forgot I said anything.)

Viy, based on a Nikolai Gogol short story, tells the tale of a bunch of seminary school students out on spring break. (Yes, really.) Seminary school students, it turns out, aren't much different than the rest of us when it comes to spring break; they party it up, with a great deal of alcohol and the requisite number of wenches. (Unfortunately, wet T-shirt contests are not the order of the day in Russia in April.) One of these seminary students is Khoma Brutus (Leonid Kuravlyov, one of Russian cinema's bigwigs, in an early role). As his friends get to their homes, only Khoma Brutus and his two friends Khaliava (the late Vadim Zakharchenko, another chap with a long history in Russian film) and Gorobetz (Vladimir Salnikov, someone American audiences might actually recognize from Mute Witness). The three find lodging, but things are not at all as they seem, senging Khoma Brutus fleeing back to the monastery--where the rector tells him that the mayor of a small town near Kiev desperately needs help; his daughter may be dying. They need prayers to be said over her body for three days, though no one will tell the poor boy why...

I have heard it said that Viy was the first Russian horror film; I have no idea whether that's accurate (and, of course, it depends on how far one wants to stretch one's definition of horror). I do know that it was the first of only four films that Konstantin Yershov would direct in his career (and if IMDB voting is to be counted on as a measure of popularity, it's his most popular by a factor of 75 or so), and for the sheer fun factor, I haven't seen much in Russian cinema, before or since, that compares with it. It's low budget by necessity--even a world-famous director like Tarkovsky couldn't get the budgets he needed in Soviet Russia--but while that leads by definition to cheesy special effects, the acting is superb, the pacing is pitch-perfect, and, as I've said previously in this review, it's a whole lot of fun. If you're looking for a movie to have on in the background at a party, and you want a really good one instead of the Z-grade junk I usually recommend for that purpose, Viy fits the bill to a T (or a V), especially since it's finally available on DVD. Good stuff all around. *** ",1228608000,2,2779,4.52988047808765
1624692,5,B00005M20C,"I first heard about Viy from our local newspaper film reviewer. His son while at college, bought this title while standing in line at the college book store.  This is one great film! I watched it first, with English sub-titles while hearing the audio in Russian. ""What a kick!' This may be an old title but it has a freshness that will surprize you. The special effects are  way head of anything else from that  time.
This is a great film to watch while its snowing outside. a film to keep you warm.",1218499200,,499,4.344086021505376

Synopsis: Brother Khoma, a young, Ukrainian Orthodox seminarian unintentionally beats an ugly, old witch to death after casting a spell on the surprised clergyman and mounting him as though he were a horse to soar in tandem through the night air in unholy flight. As she lies dying in the grass she transforms into a beautiful young girl as the confused Khoma runs from the scene.

Unfortunately the good Brother is assigned to perform a solitary three night prayer vigil over the same dead girl's body a few days later. For three successive evenings he must enter alone into an old wooden church and pray from dusk until dawn for the soul of the ""dearly departed"" As soon as he begins to pray the witch returns to life and attacks the frightened penitent. If not for the sacred circle he so wisely traced around him before beginning all would be lost.

The sound of the cock crowing to announce daybreak brings the demonic attacks to an end, giving Khoma a respite to eat, sleep, reflect and prepare for the next assault. As you might have guessed the attacks increase in intensity each night until the witch finally decides to call upon powerful demonic forces to assist her. In one final attempt to overcome the hated seminarian she summons forth VIY, the Spirit of Evil and the Devil's Emissary on Earth.

Critique: The '67 film of the supernatural, `VIY - Spirit of Evil' is superbly translated from Ukrainian folklore to the screen by N. Gogal. It is a surreal, macabre and mesmerizing journey into the darker corners of the spirit world done in unique and unforgettable fashion. The imagery is highly imaginative, evocative and disturbing with a noticeable Bermanesque feel. The sequence of the re-animated witch circling the sacred ring attempting to penetrate and attack the young seminarian is superbly done and absolutely unnerving.

My Rating: `VIY - The Spirit of Evil' is a classic, -5 Stars-.",1204070400,11,1946,4.867069486404834
1624694,4,B00005M20C,If you can figure out the command buttons you will have your choice of languages and subtitles for this fun and scary Russian movie about an inexperienced young priest who is ordered to a country estate to perform exorcism on the corpse of a witch.  She proceeds to call down her supernatural wrath on him.  If you like the old Roger Corman pictures inspired by Poe you will probably love this.,1162771200,,394,4.535211267605634
1624695,4,B00005M20C,"An enjoyable and different horror film. Only the overproduced conclusion mars it. The first of the three  nights the ""hero"" must spend in a tomb with a dead witch is one of the most frightening scenes ever. Viy is worth a view just for that and the second night. But that third one!!! Definitely worth the price.",1127347200,3,312,4.473684210526316
1624696,4,B00005M20C,"Enigmatic, with a depth of 'Russian' which is to be savoured. Made in 1967, this film is a delight of Russian culture, not easy to follow, sometimes wandering, but always rich. Well recommended.",1126051200,3,194,4.909090909090909
1624697,3,B00005M20C,"If you're a Gogol fanatic like myself, this is a must buy. Other than Viy, you get an extremely funny Soviet-era documentary about ""Comrade Gogol,"" plus an exert from Portrait, a silent-era movie based on another (and better) Gogol story. I would've actually rather have gotten the entire Portrait than Viy.
Viy was a so-so story by Gogol and the film is also so-so -- not scary in the least. The acting and the writing (and the translations) are also so-so.",1034553600,,458,4.666666666666667

7945295,4,B00005M20C,"The editing on this movie is crazy. Eisenstein level editing. It's a pretty great film just for that. Thankfully, you also get a pretty fun little horror film too.

It was made during the days of the USSR and because of that films like this were rare. As far as the communists were concerned, horror films were the work of decadent, western religious types and had no place in glorious, atheist utopia they were creating. Most authors who were into stuff like this were censored. Viy got away with it cause it's based on a short story by Gogol that the communists latched onto because they thought he criticized the old tsarists regime enough to be kept about, which we're lucky cause they did their best to destroy all manner of classic literature along the way to erase the past like with Mikhail Bulgakov.

So, while most of the guys that wanted to write fantasy simply changed their magic terms to science terms, a few intrepid people tried to make stuff like this. Even better, they made it like they were making those decadent western type movies. It plays like a Hammer film. Viy contains scared peasants, busty women in minimal sheer clothing, monsters, demonic possession, crypts, and a surprising lack of constant pro-communist government propaganda. You then get that crazy editing, which helps lend itself to some excellent special effects.

Thankfully, the dvd is subtitled and that helps with following the plot. It'd still be easy to follow cause the movie is pretty simple and visually everything is played up. You could follow it with the sound off but why would you want to do that?",1460851200,2,1600,4.768953068592058

7945297,4,B00005M20C,"Based on a story by Nikolai Gogol, ""Viy"" is not your ordinary horror film. It is part Russian folktale, part Grimm fairy tale, and part nightmare. (Those who have read Bram Stoker's ""Lady of the Shroud"" or Angela Carter's collection ""The Bloody Chamber"" will see Gogol's influence.) ""Viy"" is creepy, satiric, and intriguing. At the center of the whimsical story is the corpse of a lovely young woman, portrayed by idyllic beauty Natalya Varley, and a hapless seminary student who must deliver a prayer vigil over her coffin for three nights. What unfolds over the course of the three nights is a story on mystery, magic, vengeance, and horror.",1416960000,,643,4.908256880733945

7945299,5,B00005M20C,"Every time Halloween rolls around, I'm always on the lookout for something appropriate to watch. I've had this DVD for 7 years now and I remember liking it when I first watched it but that was right after I purchased it and I hadn't seen it since then. Having recently re-read Gogol's original story THE VIY (pronounced VEEyuh) in Peter Haining's marvelous collection THE GHOULS, which consists of the original stories that were the basis of classic horror films (THE VIY was the source of Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY although it's a very free adaptation), I decided that it was high time to rewatch this very faithful 1967 Russian adaptation of the story and boy, was I rewarded! THE VIY is nothing short of a modern day classic especially if you are into old school horror.

It looks as if  the Russians (or Soviets as they were then) were trying to make their version of a Hammer horror film. The setting is in the past, the colors are artistic as opposed to realistic and the short running time of 72 minutes means that the film is as tight as can be. The story concerns a rural seminary student who must keep watch over the dead body of a young woman for 3 days reading biblical verses to protect her soul from dark powers. Little does he know that the young girl's body houses the spirit of an old witch and that he is about to face all sorts of terrors and temptations. A real winner from start to finish with a truly Russian flavor and something that I think Gogol himself would have been highly pleased with. In Russian with subtitles although this DVD gives you a host of options. A treat for horror film connoisseurs!",1383264000,2,1626,4.489864864864865

7945302,5,B00005M20C,"Perhaps five whole stars is a bit much for this obscure gem, but it's also easy to overlook it's merits. It might also be of little interest to many fans of newer horror as it has no gore and only a handful of scenes even attempt to feel creepy. That being said, the scenes that do are all the more consuming because of how they are spaced--particularly the infamous last scene of the film, which is perhaps amongst the most effective horror moments in all of cinema.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a fable-like horror story, or anyone who is at least interested in seeing what a horror produced in such an underrepresented territory looks like.",1357603200,,679,4.520325203252033
