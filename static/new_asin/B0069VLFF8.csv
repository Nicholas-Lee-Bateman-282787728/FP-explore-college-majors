4981015,5,B0069VLFF8,"First DVD is about an hour ling, yet it gives a beginner an idea what yoga is about. Jennifer Kries starts with an explanation of yoga, does some breathing practices, and a simple yet sweet warmup. I love that she gives a basic sun salutation and builds it up - adding an asana or pose. Sun salutation is a sequence of yoga postures. The most difficult pose would be the Dancer pose in this dvd, yet she makes it seem easy. In the last part, ""Serenity"", Jennifer ends the workout with the Corpse pose and explains its significance. She makes yoga meaningful and more than a series of postures. This is the best highlight of the first DVD. The other DVDs in the set are easy, fun, and shorter than the first. I would encourage the buyer to try the first DVD if he or she is new to yoga.",1390262400,3,785,4.24
4981016,4,B0069VLFF8,"I got this at Target last week for $12.99 and think it's a great start to yoga. I've only used the first disc so far, and have tried each of the routines a couple of times now. The woman sounds calm and shows the easier way and then more challenging ways in the same pose. It is amazing to think how flexible and capable she looks and I hope that I can get there with practice.",1358985600,2,377,3.973684210526316
4981017,4,B0069VLFF8,"This really is an excellent beginners set of dvd's.  I suggest previewing each DVD to decide the order you want to use in your workout routine. I enjoy starting with the stretch as a warm up. Strengthens your core and helps me with lower back issues. As others have pointed out, sold for less elsewhere.
Don't forget your yoga mat.",1341446400,2,331,4.516666666666667
4981018,5,B0069VLFF8,"This is a nice, slow-paced instructional DVD set w/o too much talking.  I bought it at Target for $14.99 though!!  The first DVD was an hour, but I felt so relaxed after.  The instructor is graceful and her voice is soothing.  The poses are done slowly enough so that anyone can follow and she demonstrates alternative poses for beginners.  I am excited because I feel that I can actually progress with this DVD set.  Others I have tried have either been too simple or too complex.",1339545600,4,481,4.534883720930233
8495511,1,B0069VLFF8,"...In the 80's and 90's. The cover of this set is misleading. The actual videos are really old, which is slightly off-putting. In one of the videos a woman is wearing a uni-tard reminiscent of one seen in old Jane Fonda Workouts from the 80's. Which would be fine, if I was looking for an outdated workout video. Unfortunately, I couldn't find my leg warmers, so I will continue to exercise in this century. Next time I guess!",1521936000,,426,4.4743589743589745
8495512,5,B0069VLFF8,"Excellent video from yoga giant GAIAM. There are newer videos out there, but if you are a beginner who prefers DVDs, you can't go wrong with this set. All of the basics, none of the annoyances of yoga classes or overly chatty poseurs. I felt better instantly after just 15 minutes every morning. This is not a sophisticated critique, but--as noted--I am a beginner. Take it for what it is and enjoy.  Lots of physical possibilities and coaching on these discs--great value for the money.",1501718400,,487,4.729411764705882
8495513,5,B0069VLFF8,Quick delivery. The CD case still had the plastic on it and the contents were brand new even though it was advertised as used.,1470614400,,126,4.291666666666667
8495514,1,B0069VLFF8,Not for the inflexible. No instruction on how to adjust moves for those without flexibility.  Instructions are too fast and hard to keep up with if you haven't done yoga before.,1465689600,,177,4.709677419354839
8495515,5,B0069VLFF8,Very pleased with this ' set. Instructor is very clear with poses and stress the importance of breathing to get full benefits of the exercises and is appropriately paced(not to fast). Looking forward to complete the full 4 DVD 's.,1452816000,,230,4.775
8495516,2,B0069VLFF8,"The yoga stretch video is so funny I can't even take it seriously. It's filmed probably in the 90's and there is some men playing the drums in the background and I just can't get over how strange it is. I dunno but if you like current exercise DVDs and not that truly awkward stuff they made in the 80's and 90's, DONT GER THIS SET.  I gave it two stars cause I mean it isn't horrible but I rather not be distracted by weird outfits and some men beating on drums in the background.",1436745600,,481,4.063157894736842
8495517,5,B0069VLFF8,"Perfect, just as described!",1422748800,,27,6.0
8495518,3,B0069VLFF8,"But for those of us who don't fit that criteria, this is NOT for beginner's.  Other than the breathing exercises some of the moves simply cannot be done by a beginner.  Period.  You need to be able to do things like go from lying flat on your back to a sitting position using only your stomach muscles.  Uh huh.  By the time you get there, she's moved on.  Where is the yoga instructor who is middle aged, over weight, and can't do half the moves either?  I never made it past the first 10 minutes because it was too frustrating trying to keep up.  This reinforced my theory that yoga is for the young and anorexic",1403395200,4,614,4.232758620689655
8495519,5,B0069VLFF8,It was quick and i love the dvd. It is easy to follow and the dvd got here very quickly,1393286400,,87,3.4
8495520,5,B0069VLFF8,"I wish I had found this DVD years ago.  I have been doing this consistently for several months now and I love the results.  I feel like it is effectively helping me combat that middle age spread that seemed to sneak up on me.  The Beginner workout is well done and, as she says, it gets easier over time.  My husband has started to join me in my workouts.  He has seen how effective it can be and is already seeing gains in strength and flexibility.  The relaxations techniques come in handy for both of us! :-)  I highly recommend this video.",1390521600,2,543,4.264705882352941
