7919708,5,B000042OIN,These videos are fabulous my daughters and I learned how to sew using only these videos.  My daughters have surpassed me in sewing.  I thank God for Pam's williness to use her skill to make videos for those who never was taught the skill of sewing. May God bless her business.,1245801600,5,276,4.392156862745098
7919709,5,B000042OIN,"Dont listen to those who says it is boring. It is not. On the contrary it is very interesting. After all it is educational DVD,not entertaining..And they teach you everything you need to know about sewing in very detailed and dry way,.The way i believe works  best for me. Maybe cze i m Russian and like things to be straight forward. Beauty of this Dvd that it is divided on chapters and u can easily refer to any information you need. Get yourself all 7 and you wouldnt need to attend any expensive sewing courses. You can learn art of sewing individualy in a comfortable atmosphere of your onw home.",1241136000,7,602,4.472727272727273

7919711,5,B000042OIN,This is one of the best sewing videos I have seen. I have learned a lot and it was like I was sewing right along with her. AAAA+++++,1116979200,,132,3.75
7919712,5,B000042OIN,"I had took home ec in junior high school & loved doing the sewing projects. Years & years later I received a sewing machine for a gift. For about a year I tried to teach myself but could only do very, very basic stuff. That is until this video. This video has very helpful information & easy to understand demonstrations. The time chart you get along with the video is very convenient; you know how far to fast-forward to get to the part you need to review. The best part is you always have them on hand in case you need to jog your memory. I plan on continuing with the whole series.",1057017600,2,584,4.176991150442478
7919713,5,B000042OIN,"If you have sewn in the past and want to refresh your skills, I highly recommend this video.  I have sewn for years but it was always the same thing. I wanted something different and my children were asking for new  things. I called You Can Make It after visiting their website and decided  to purchase the Level 2 video.  Pam is very thorough in her explanation and  takes you step by step through the sewing process. I have sewn several  skirts in the past but I learned several new techniques that have already  benefited me greatly.  She is also there after the sale if you have  questions or need clarification on a given topic.  I have used the level 1  video with two of my daughters in their homeschooling curriculum with great  success. This is an excellent series of tapes and I recommend that they be  added to your sewing library. Her love of sewing is apparent and her  teaching skills are superb!",960940800,10,910,4.469512195121951
