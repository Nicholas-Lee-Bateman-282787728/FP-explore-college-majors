2634604,3,B000HDRAP8,"I looked forward to this performance.  There were elements in the staging which left me completely baffled - in particular the clowns.  The dcor was rather minimal, but that did not detract too much.  The singing and acting were excellent, especially 'Marco' and 'Guiseppe'.  I was most upset by two things.  Firstly, certain numbers were omitted (for example ""I am a courtier grave and serious"").  Secondly, this was probably done to make room for all the additional material, most of which is dated and uninteresting (for example the endlessly unfunny ""Right down regular royal queen"".)",1167868800,4,588,5.136842105263158
2634605,5,B000HDRAP8,"If I am not mistaken, this production was first staged by the Stratford (Ontario) Festival Company. Also, if I am not mistaken again, that original Canadian production is still available on DVD.

What a wonderful breath of fresh air blows through this ""Gondoliers""! I agree with Cameo's comments and caveats, e.g. the omission of ""I am a courtier grave and serious"" - which could have been done magnificently and with great fun! - and the changes/additions to the orignal script to suit politcally aware Canadians - and Australians - but those detract only minimally in my opinion from the overall enjoyment.

The general 'liveliness' of the production is outstanding. Quite clearly, the members of the cast - both principals and chorus - were chosen not only for the high quality of their singing, but also for their dancing/acting abilities. To me, as an elderly and former Brit (now retired and living in California) who knew the original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company extremely well, I have to say that if that company had been able to come up with similar productions back in the 1970s, it might well still be alive and kicking today.

I must add that I consider the Stratford (Ontario) production of ""Iolanthe"" to be equally fresh, stimulating and fun in every way. Maureen Forrester as a diva of a Fairy Queen leads a wonderful cast - without a single weak link. When the chorus of Fairies and Peers join Lords Mountararat and Tolloler at the end of the Act 2 ""If you go in"" trio, the syncopated tap-dance/soft-shoe shuffle is a special triumph for all concerned and should be seen by all Gilbert and Sullivan enthusiasts!",1166918400,18,1626,4.82078853046595
2634617,3,B000HDRAP8,"I enjoyed this production - but I agree with all the other comments for the most part.  The cutting of ""I am a Courtier Grave and Serious"" is most unfortunate.  The much mentioned extensive re-writing of Gilbert's lyrics is so over-done that it really detracts from the production in many places.  As stated by others - it has made this performance completely dated.  A little up-dating is fun - but this was over the line.  I did not mind Dennis Olsen's accent that much.  But the addition of the commedia del-arte dancers got old.  It was cute at the beginning, but they hardly appeared in the 2nd act and there just didn't seem to be any sense to them.  The production would have been better without them.  One of my major objections to this production (which I also felt is a problem with the otherwise excellent Stratford ""Iolanthe,"" and the Linda Ronstadt ""Pirates"") is the re-writing and re-orchestration of Sullivan's music.  I really object to this.  Arthur Sullivan is a 1st rate composer and a brilliant orchestrator.  It is one thing to add a repeat here and there to assist with an entrance or exit - but this went beyond that.  For me this together with the text revisions really marred this otherwise delightful production.  The cast is excellent - the chorus is terrific as is the orchestra.  But please, approach Sullivan (and Gilbert) like you would Verdi or Puccini or da Ponte or Boito - with respect for their work.",1269129600,11,1436,4.665338645418327
2634618,3,B000HDRAP8,"I have seen bad Gilbert & Sullivan before. Unfortunately, particularly in the realm of video performance, that is not unusual. What makes this one so disappointing is that it had the potential to be truly excellent. The cast is fantastic - great singers, good actors, brimming with enthusiasm. The costumes and staging are imaginative. The direction is a little lacking (some cast members stand woodenly while singing), but nothing terrible. I could even have accepted the Duchess being played by a man in drag, since he was at least entertaining.

The travesty lies in the slaughter, by rewrite, of the lyrics. Multiple songs were ""updated"" in very unfunny ways. Not just a lyric here and there, or a ""modern"" verse added to the end - but a wholesale rewrite of the entire song, save a few words in the chorus. ""Royal Queen"" in particular comes to mind. The cast performed it brilliantly, but the new lyrics were very jarring.

The sound and picture are also nothing to speak of, though that is perhaps not surprising for a 1989 production. The actors appear to have been miked from the front, so that when they move toward the back of the stage, their voices fade out a bit. Mercifully, the mikes don't pick up their stomping feet, unlike some G&S videos I have seen.

That said, I would watch it again, or at least listen to the soundtrack, because there's a certain freshness in a live recording that just doesn't come through even in the best studio recording. And the singing really is good. Roger Lemke and David Hobson as Giuseppe and Marco are a delight. Lemke has a great voice. Hobson has an amazing upper range, shown off to good effect in ""We're Called Gondolieri"" and ""Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes."" It's also interesting to see him in an early role. Judging by his performances in Pinafore and Pirates (20 years later), he has become a much better actor!",1259712000,,1870,4.677811550151976
2634619,5,B000HDRAP8,excellent  recording and it is actually possible to hear the words in a clear melodic pattern rather than having a more operatic-style performance.,1257638400,,147,5.391304347826087
2634620,5,B000HDRAP8,Truly enthralling. The combination of orchestra and singing is superb. Will watch this again and again,1252713600,2,102,5.4375
2634621,5,B000HDRAP8,"Fans of Gilbert & Sullivan are in for a treat by this Opera Australia version of the operetta which is performed with all the verve and comedy that the authors intended.
From the opening sceen to the end, the cast enjoy every nunance of the script.  And there are many delightfully 'stage tricks' which make this version the best that I have ever seen.
But one must turn on the sub-titles to enjoy the 'in jokes' which pepper the story.
By the British accents and mannerisms, one would think this was a British cast, but no, the Australians do enormous justice to the language, only slipping in the vernacular for the Australian jokes.
A thoroughly enjoyable piece to watch, again and again.  I can not recommend it to highly.",1232496000,2,726,4.62015503875969
2634622,4,B000HDRAP8,"This is a fine production, as one expects from Opera Australia Those that are familiar with Canada's Stratford Festival version of The Gondoliers will instantly recognise this production, as it is virtually identical. It is, in my opinion however, better performed than it's Canadian counterpart. It is highly energetic and entertaining from start to finish.

The cast is brilliant and includes a ""young"" David Hobson (Australian audiences will be familiar with David's contributions in more recent years) and the great Dennis Olsen. Unfortunately, Dennis does not play the more traditional comic role of the Duke of Plaza-Toro, but is relegated to the smaller part of Don Alhambra. Both these players, along with the rest of the cast, put in great performances.

One of the many highlights is the choreography (again replicated from the Stratford Festival version). In particular, ""Dance a cachuca"" in act 2 deserves mention, however to say anything further would spoil it for you.

Another ""replication"" from the the Stratford Festival is the casting of a male in the role of the Duchess of Plaza-Toro, a move that probably has Gilbert turning in his grave. While I generally ""shudder at the thought"" of such a casting, in this instance it is done quite well by Graeme Ewer. Graeme has demonstrated great talent in performing comic roles for Opera Australia for many years. Whether this works for you or not will be a matter of personal taste.

The biggest disappointment I have with this production is the omission of ""I am a courtier"" from act 2. This was also omitted from the Stratford Festival version.

Overall, while this may not be the absolute best offering by Opera Australia, it is a very good and enjoyable production and holds up very well against other versions of the show.",1219622400,2,1790,4.993288590604027
2634623,5,B000HDRAP8,"Excellent actors/vocal talent, choreography, costumes, and set.  Our family really enjoyed this production with the exception of a crude reference added to the second act.  We especially like comedic abilities of each of the actors/actresses, and the very fun dance scenes.  We'd love to see more Opera Australia Gilbert and Sullivans available for purchase on DVD.",1214006400,,365,5.482142857142857
2634624,3,B000HDRAP8,"I am very happy to have the Gondoliers in a video format, as I only had my LP D'Oyly Carte version previously.  I keep hoping for a DVD G&S production like this to be in HD, but still must wait.

Although the singing and dancing are OUTSTANDING, I could only give this a three star review for the following reasons:

1. The ""clown/mime/dancers,"" although the live audience seemed to enjoy them, were a distraction to me.  Kind of like watching a fly performing as an ""extra"" in a movie.  Adding nothing but distraction.

2.  The very generous re-writing of the lyrics in so many places.  A bit of that is OK, in my opinion, but I often felt like this was no longer a Gilbert and Sullivan work, but ""based on a Light Opera by Gilbert and Sullivan.""  The extensive re-writing of the lyrics with so much ""current history"" (which is now less current, anyhow) was disappointing.  This may have been done to make it more funny and topical, but the original was also funny and still seems relevant and topical to me!  Promoting Plaza-Toro condoms seemed out of ""character"" in a G&S production.

3. The Grand Inquisitor had such a poor ""accent"" added to his ""persona.""  And him adding in a few ""Madre de Dios"" to his dialogue made it even worse.  Just like the clown/mimes, it was very distracting to me.

4. Cutting ""I am a Courtier, Grave and Serious"" to make room for the mimes and added material was unfortunate.

All together, three stars is not ""bad.""  But it could have been better!",1204675200,14,1481,4.507518796992481
2634625,5,B000HDRAP8,"This production, from start to finish-is excellent.  The principals are all uniformly terrific and seem to be having a lot of fun.  What I love especially about this production is the smooth transitioning between musical numbers.  There's never a static moment.  I thought the addition of the dancers (the ""Zanies"") was a great idea, using them in the overture was  a stroke of genius. It immediately involved the audience in the world of the play.  It is also amazing how well the entire cast can dance in addition to singing so well.  If I'm not mistaken, these were opera singers-no?  Quite astonishing-in a good way.  The choreography struck just the right balance-not too difficult, but perfectly executed to create a great illusion.  The Cachuca number with the life-sized dolls was a stroke of genius and really funny.

This is an exhilarating production.",1201651200,,862,5.0
2634626,1,B000HDRAP8,"This is a revival of the Stratford, Ontario, production of ""The Gondoliers.""  It is, therefore, putrid at second hand.  (I hastily add that this is not the fault of the talented Australian performers; they were victims of the unspeakable director and original producers who were fully given over to the demented theory that the roots of the G&S comic operas lay in the English music hall and panto.)

Previous reviewers have specified some of the horrors of this production.  I shall not repeat them here.  I merely point out that a male performer who was very good in Australian Opera's ""Patience,"" which was based on the excellent English National Opera production, is here thrust into the wigs and gowns of the Duchess of Plaza-Toro.  In the words of the Bard of Avon, ""Oh, horrible, horrible, most horrible.""

The only positive thing that can be said of this train wreck is that the AO people, by and large, can sing--a talent wholly absent in the DVD of the original, Canadian version of this piteous, misadventured, overthrown production.",1168300800,9,1044,4.8977272727272725
8138789,4,B000HDRAP8,"Not too bad. Pretty good for how G&S is handled these days.  I think this was 1990s, so the modern Broadway-campy-mugging craziness had not hit full-force yet.",1480550400,,159,4.888888888888889
8138790,4,B000HDRAP8,"A good performance, but the buyer should be aware that the common G&S tradition of updating/localizing Gilbert's original topical references can backfire if overdone.  In this case, in addition to the passage of 25 years obscuring some of the references, they are either localized Australian references obscure in most of the world, or comments on Britain from an Australian perspective, thus not necessarily on characters or incidents familiar to US listeners.
The performances are good.
The director, however, has succumbed to the common desire to put his own stamp on the production.  Thus we have the carnival ""zanies"" reset props and show up at inopportune times to interfere with the effect of the main performance.  I found them increasingly irritating.
If the zanies were not there, I would be more inclined to give this a 5 based on the musical quality.",1439510400,,862,5.099290780141844

8138793,4,B000HDRAP8,"Lively interpretation of opera, some nice dancing as well. I think I picked the best version of Gondoliers out there.",1397606400,,117,4.9
8138794,5,B000HDRAP8,"Even though he had just begun his career, Mr. Hobson's voice was so exciting!  How wonderful that he didn't become a lawyer!",1390089600,,124,4.636363636363637
8138795,1,B000HDRAP8,"Can't say much about the other aspects of the disc or performance, as I couldn't get past the first couple of songs. Sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom.",1319155200,,159,4.333333333333333
8138796,5,B000HDRAP8,"I have watched this video a half dozen times and continue to find new puns, twists, and wonderful insights into what many believe is the best of the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.  The melancholoy/naive/fragile  clowns who appear and re-appear at transitional moments mime and dance and wordlessly express the imagined carnival world of Venice associated with Mardi Gras.  Ther are inspired additions to a production rich in choreography and in affectionate understanding of the complicated story line and confused characters.  The comedy underscores the humanity of these characters.  G and S often is seen in a time-warp of Victorian convention.  This production does not seem to live in that straight-laced end of nineteenth century, but breathes in the timeless world in which all true art resides.  Yes, there are additions and subtractions from the original text and music, but all for the cause of lighting up this masterful comedy so that our 21st eyes and ears can perceive its creative, subtle, funny, and endearing qualities.  Bravo to the singers who dance as well as they sing and act and bravo to the director and choreographer who understand well how to entertain and reveal and move the audience.",1292025600,,1213,5.121827411167513
8138797,5,B000HDRAP8,"I must agree with the other reviewers that this performance is not purely Gilbert and Sullivan but it was purely fun and entertaining to me!

It can stand on its own as a joyous fun time of laughter and entertainment. I watched it again last night and by the time it was over I was laughing and refreshed by the experience. Yes, it does have some flaws but these are easily overlooked in my opinion as an evening of first class entertainment unfolds.

Some of the inside jokes went completely over my head, but this again did not present any insurmountable obstacles for me. I thought the dance with the dolls in Act 2 was hilarious.

If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan purist then this production may offend you, as it does some of the reviewers; if you are looking for a well produced and performed evening of musical fun then this may well provide it for you!",1273795200,3,861,4.40251572327044
8138798,1,B000HDRAP8,"While the production quality is excellent, this is not a good choice for those who truly love Gilbert and Sullivan as they wrote it. The Aussies changed the lyrics in several songs, probably in a misguided attempt to modernize it. A failed gesture that proves great works cannot be improved upon. If you enjoy seeing a classic taken down to the level of the gutter, then this is for you. If you love the original lyrics then this will surely disappoint you.  Sorry I wasted the money on it and will never again buy Australian.",1273449600,3,526,4.536842105263158
