5972586,3,B00F9Q3W5K,The movie was interesting but it did take liberty with established views. The only real issue is with the film quality.. terrible. The acting.. it is not great but worked for me. Fix the film and it will be worth the 1.99.,1420070400,,222,4.309523809523809

5972589,1,B00F9Q3W5K,"I'm giving this one star because, even though it had religious overtones, they were not at all accurate according to scripture. This is an extremely misleading film, so be prepared. On top of religious deception, the acting was below b-quality... by far the worst I've ever seen. It seemed as though they selected a cast without any regard to acting experience whatsoever (it's that bad). Fortunately it didn't stream well so I shut it off midway through the movie (thank goodness!). I should mention, however, that Amazon gave me a refund promptly!",1395792000,3,549,4.978260869565218

For centuries, scholars have been debating the two main possibilities for the origin and meaning of life. Some aspire to a higher philosophical dimension, which they can't find in the theory of evolution, while others dismiss as irrational any reference to an almighty god.
But what if another theory, one both rational and with philosophical depth, were to be available?
This is what the Message proposes: Thousands of years ago, scientists from another planet came to Earth and created all forms of life, including human beings, whom they created in their own image. References to these scientists and their work can be found in the ancient texts of many cultures. Due to their highly advanced technology, they were considered as gods by our primitive ancestors and often referred to as 'Elohim' which in ancient Hebrew meant 'Those who came from the sky'.
Despite being a plural word, Elohim was mistranslated over time to the singular 'God' reference that appears in modern-day Bibles.
Nevertheless, these people who came from the sky (the Elohim) educated humanity through the ages with the help of various messengers (also called prophets) with whom they had made contact. Each messenger was given a message suitable for the level of understanding prevailing at the time, with the primary purpose of instilling basic principles of non-violence and respect. Once humanity reached a sufficient level of scientific understanding, the Elohim decided to make themselves more visible in UFO sightings and to conceive their final message. Rael was given two missions: spreading that last message on Earth and preparing an embassy to welcome the return of our creators.

The atheist 'Intelligent Design Theory' offers a rational solution to the age-old debate between God-believers and evolutionists. Its compatible not only with today's scientific discoveries but also with the ancient historical accounts of all cultures.
But don't take our word for it. Read Intelligent Design - Message from the Designers for yourself and do your own research.

5972596,2,B00F9Q3W5K,"A hundred billion stars stars in our galaxy, a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe, and it seems now that a sizable share of those innumerable suns might have planets circling them.  How amusing that so many religions preaching the virtue of humility also teach that the behavior of Man is somehow of great significance in this unfathomable construct of matter, energy, time and distance.  This gross magnification of humanity's importance to the whole of creation is the pinnacle of arrogance.  I say accept the humility, and put the rest of the nonsense out of your minds.

The message aside, almost every review panned the acting.  Acting is a performance art like singing or playing a musical instrument.  Very few people would dare a public performance after ten violin lessons.  No such wise restraint applies to actors, sad to say.  The little girl was the best, the guy with the fishing pole the worst. Two stars for avoiding the three 'P's: Porn, Profanity, and Politics.",1506988800,,996,4.957831325301205

The little girl and the female FBI. The editing was crap, when they sat at the table there like six or seven cuts for no reason at all. The best thing was the plot.

5972620,2,B00F9Q3W5K,"Although I liked the premise, facts and viewpoints in the movie, this movie was so painful to watch. There was bad acting (I mean REALLY BAD) to the point where you could see at least one of the main characters' eyes moving back and forth as he spoke, indicating that he was reading his lines off of cue cards throughout the movie. At times, the writing of the script was a little weird, as in the characters speaking and the viewer thinking ""who says that??"" All in all, watch it if you have nothing (and I mean nothing) else to do/watch but if you can find another movie with the same idea behind it, I'd choose that! Also, another point you should know is that I rented the SD version and the picture was very badly damaged in parts of the movie, leading to complete static during some parts. I don't know what this is due to, but be aware.",1451865600,5,843,4.275

I'm sure they were working with a low budget but actors either responded too early with their lines and or it doesn't come natural to them.",1531094400,,366,4.083333333333333

But like one reviewer said, I wanted to like it, because, I saw that there was a biblical message, so I forced myself to watch it ( emphasis on 'forced ). It carried a message, but the poor acting brought this movie down to two stars ( barely). If the actors had been better, I would have given a better score.

8613511,1,B00F9Q3W5K,"More trash acting. I am not sure where they came from but Amazon Prime and Pureflix are both loaded with these D- and F- grade movies. If you are not familiar with movie grades the B movies used to be pretty bad, these are far worse. Where do they get these wannabe actors from? I kid you not, these actors could be outdone by most shy preschool children. Even if this could have been a halfway good storyline, the acting is worse than fingernails on a chalkboard, Jim Carry in dumb and dumber with his screech scene, etc. The video editing and audio quality are horrendous.

You couldn't find this many bad actors on pure accident even from an unpaid, uncredited crowd of people just looking to be in a bad, low budget street shoot as silent, drooling zombie extras for a distant background scene in the dark. The movie is about aliens or something I think, the acting is so dreadful I have lost track of the story line. And the really disturbing thing is that this is not even the worst of a lot dreadfully bad quality movies that has come out on Prime and Pureflix recently.

If like me, you are reviewing these so called movies here on Amazon because Pureflix doesn't allow you to rate movies there and they both have them available for viewing, then you know exactly what I am talking about. You have probably also noticed a large batch of movies with a nearly all black cast as well, in one the women was screaming for her parts all through the show, another where the opening family scene in it was so loud it could deafen you before you could turn it down.  To top it off the audio editing fixed none of it so in one case I couldn't get past the first 3 minutes of the show. And there is a lot of hints of anti-white  propaganda in some of them as well which is especially troubling considering many of them are supposed to be Christian movies. I don't know if the latter are from a wannabe studio or group or what they are for sure sure but they have the same lot of faults in them.

Remember the old magazine ads in which you could get your books or poems published through through a shady company? The catch was that you had to pay them a bundle of money to be in them and then pay another bundle of money for a few books to have when it finally had enough suckers to complete a print. I think maybe there is such a movie company out there that is using the same business model. You pay them a fortune and they will let you act in it. LOL
