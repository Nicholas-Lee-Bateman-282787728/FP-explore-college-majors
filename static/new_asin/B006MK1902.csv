8621964,4,B006MK1902,"Originally produced from 1959 through 1961 as ""Alcoa Presents"", this anthology series based on true events beyond the normal human experience is totally new to me.  The twenty-six episodes presented here in this economical two-disc package are very good with fine production values and extremely well acted with the usual quality character actors supporting the many up and coming stars featured which include Warren Beatty, Cloris Leachman, Suzanne Pleshette, Yvette Mimieux, Mike Connors, Robert Blake and Charles Bronson.  It is assisted enormously by the presence of its director John Newland as its classy and distinguished host, giving the  series that little extra touch of mystery and intrigue.  The stories are interesting and involving; a little predictable maybe but remember the episodes were written more than fifty years ago when this type of story idea was very much more original. What surprised me a little is the quality of this set which is as close to pristine as you could expect. Highly recommended.",1407283200,2,1021,5.283950617283951
