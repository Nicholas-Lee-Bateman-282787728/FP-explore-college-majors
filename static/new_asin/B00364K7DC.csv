4072589,2,B00364K7DC,"I was disappointed in this movie. I don't think they used ANY real orcas. Willy was either computer generated or plastic. It was not believable for  moment. The graphics were horrendous! However, I m glad that they did not make little Bindi interact with a real whale especially with what happened to the Sea World Killer Whale Trainer but they could have made Willy a little more realistic looking. Bindi is really a cute little girl but she can't act!",1270857600,,453,4.6625

4072591,5,B00364K7DC,"I ordered this DVD as soon as I saw the commercial for it because our five year old son loves whales and also likes the show ""Bindi the Jungle Girl"".
It arrived today and we watched it tonight--my son LOVES IT!!  Grandma and I also enjoyed it!  As another reviewer said it's a great family movie.  Even though it's predictable (most kid's movies are), it's well done and suitable for a five year old and was also enjoyed by the adults.

The South African setting was beautiful and the music was nice too.  Highly recommend this movie!",1269648000,,534,4.463917525773196
4072592,5,B00364K7DC,"This movie was a real surprise, our family has watched all theh Free Willy movies from the past and decided to give this one a try.  Bindi Irwin is a very talented young lady and very believeable thorughout the movie.  Beau Bridges is such a wonderful character actor and he plays the gruff grandfather very well.  We througly enjoyed the movie and the friendship between two young children in the movie.  Steve Irwin would be so proud of his little girl.",1269302400,23,455,4.580246913580247
4072593,3,B00364K7DC,"This is the 4th in the Free Willy series, but it's not about the original Willy.  It is filmed in South Africa and Jason James Richter or none of the other cast from the first 3 movies are in it, but it's based on the same story line, a Orca is caught, can't get out, an evil man wants him and in the end he reunites with his family.  I won't give details but it's a great family to watch.  If you are a Free Willy fan it is a must see and buy.",1268438400,14,444,3.702127659574468

4072653,4,B00364K7DC,"The late Steve Irwins Daughter Bindi takes to the big Screen. Actually you sort of had to see this coming she has grown up famous just because of her Dad. She actually did a good job in this movie. It did not seem forced. I would call this a family friendly movie. It is the same basic story as the other Free Willy movies. Only this time it is a girl who finds the whale, names him and fights to set him free.
So big storm, baby whale gets washed into Pirates Cove Grandpas marine park. Bindi finds the whale, soon the whale is drawing huge crowds as the whale is growing day by day quickly out growing the cove. Big Corporate guy wants to buy whale for his park, Grandpa considering it. Eventually they discover Willys Family and like the first Willy, baby Willy goes free. And Grandpa and Granddaughter grow closer.",1397606400,,818,4.352941176470588

4072697,5,B00364K7DC,"I am eternally grateful to have found a new Free Willy movie with Bindi Irwin. Who knew that the character she acts out in the movie would stop at nothing to be sure that a helpless orca would be released from confinement? I imagine that if Steve was alive, he would be very proud of his daughter for participating in this new movie. And this movie proves that with the help of your friends or loved ones, you can do just about anything.",1309737600,,437,4.27710843373494
4072698,5,B00364K7DC,"This is a great movie to watch during summer vacation for the kids. My 8 year old loved this movie and is now a Bindi Irwin fan. We have not seen the other Free Willy movies but now plan to, and hope they are as good as this one.",1307577600,,229,3.693877551020408
4072699,4,B00364K7DC,"Wonderful movie. As other people have mentioned, and I agree with, Bindi Irwin is an excellent actress for her age. She's very believable and realistic. It's neat how she played the role in this new version years after the original Free Willy movies. I bought this movie not only because I love whales and dolphins, but because my 3 neices also do, and because the character is a girl who can relate to them. They all loved it. Movie was well made, however the baby orca was not a real orca. It was a mechanical robot. Some scenes you can really tell it is fake and was poorly done. When they showed its pod above the water some scenes might have been real footage of real orcas-like in the very start of the film. When shown underwater all those scenes were computerized images. This is why I gave it 4 stars. The story and acting was great though. I still recommend it to anyone who loves whales or dolphins or sea life and like me and my neices feel that these animals don't belong in tanks or for entertainment purposes, but deserve to be free. Free as they are born to live naturally in the open sea. I think maybe that's why they didn't use a real whale. It would destroy the whole meaning of the story in the first place. Then it would be ok to use a robotic whale.",1306281600,,1272,4.282157676348548

4072701,5,B00364K7DC,I thought this movie was great!! I think Bindi really is a very talented actress. I can't believe it was her first movie. She wasn't perfect but she was good. This movie is definitely worth seeing. I think the whole family will love this movie. I think it is more low budget compared to the other Free Willy's but it is still a good Free Willy movie that everyone should love. I loved the low price I payed for it too. Less than $8 is a really good price. The special features were ok. Not anything really great. Bindi seems like she really does love animals and had fun making this movie. Everyone else in the movie did a pretty good job too. I think I highly recommend people to see this movie if they liked the original Free Willy.,1296000000,,734,4.25

4072703,3,B00364K7DC,"While I had never seen this particular movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it as I have each of the Free Willy series.  The friendship between Willy and humans is so precious and shows the incredible intelligence of this mammal.  It makes a person fall in love with his heart.  I'm grateful for wholesome movies that can be watched by anyone.",1291075200,,334,4.627118644067797
4072714,2,B00364K7DC,"I love the first two ""Free Willy"" movies (haven't seen the third)and I so wanted to love this movie. I have a nearly 5-year-old daughter and want her to love whales like I do, and thought that a ""Willy"" movie with a little girl (and who doesn't love Bindi Irwin?!) would be perfect.
Unfortunately, this movie drowns in a badly-written script, and too many slow and unnecessary scenes.
Spoiler Alert -- if you haven't yet seen the movie, I'm about to give much of it away.
The premise is predictable -- Kirra's dad is hurt and he ships her to Africa to spend some time with her grandfather while he heals. There she finds her grandfather seems a bit of a slacker. He sends someone else to the airport to pick her up because he's gambling. He owns a rundown amusement park that's getting its butt kicked by the movie's bad guy, who owns a super cool amusement park on the other side of town.
After a storm, a baby orca is stuck in the lagoon outside the amusement park. Kirra befriends it and names it Willy. I enjoyed seeing Bindi's Kirra interact with the whale -- even if it obviously was a fake whale. I think Bindi is a good actress. I hope that next time we see her, it's in a better movie than this.
The bad guy amusement park guy wants to buy the orca.
As mentioned earlier, the pacing was slow. My easily entertained daughter often was bored. At one point she said, ""I hope something good happens soon."" I pushed the ""skip to next scene"" button several times (was either that or stop watching). The new scene would begin and we'd find we hadn't missed anything important.
One big problem was that the ""Kirra helping her grandfather realize and reach his potential"" storyline was not fully developed.
And the CG was awful! Underwater scenes showing Willy learning to catch fish with echolocation look like a really bad video game. I know orcas swim fast, but this one moves like a supersonic jet. And somehow Kirra and her friend who are above the water are able to see what's going on underwater.
And the whale is bringing tons more people into the rundown amusement park, yet the grandpa complains they can't afford to feed it? And they keep closing the park too? Didn't make sense.
I gave it two stars only because I do love Bindi Irwin. I wish this movie had lived up to its potential.",1288915200,5,2295,4.453681710213777
4072715,3,B00364K7DC,"I was excited to see a movie with Bindi Irwin; she is lots of fun, like her dad. But this movie .... good actors but I didn't find it to be as, well, professionally done as I expected. Willy surely must have been, at least at times, a mechanical baby whale. I guess maybe it was a low-budget film? I'm glad I saw it once. I don't feel a need to see it again. Little ones might watch it over and over. They are not so particular.",1285804800,,428,3.9310344827586206

4072718,5,B00364K7DC,So rare to find a family movie where there isn't death or violence involved. I love this movie and so does my nine year old. Very wonderful message in the movie. Bought my daughter the orignal Free Willy and she was bored to tears. But not this movie..a big thumbs up!,1275868800,2,268,4.2745098039215685

4072720,5,B00364K7DC,"The 4th movie of the Free Willy series is truly a delight. I loved every minute of it! Bindi Irwin was truly amazing as Kirra. It is so amazing how much she looks like her father, and carry's on his legacy through her knowledge of animals, and her love for them...which makes this even better, because you can tell her passion for animals is really genuine. I also thought the scenery was so beautiful, the acting by all the cast was excellent, and this movie ranks up there as being just as wonderful as the other Free Willy movies. I thought the ending was very powerful and emotional, that it made me cry. Hearing the song by Bindi Irwin while the credits were rolling were amazing, and I recoginized her voice immediately. Bindi Irwin seems so down-to-earth, like I said before a genuinly passionate person, and I hope she remains following in her father's footsteps.

  I am defintely going to buy it, and on blu-ray, so I get the highest quality, and so I can see the bonus features, because the one I  rented didn't have any on there.",1272844800,8,1041,4.492063492063492
4072721,5,B00364K7DC,"Like others who reviewed this movie, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  My daughter's watched it twice in the past 24 hours.  It's a very sweet movie.  Bindi Irwin and Beau Bridges are great, as are other characters in the movie.  Even the ""bad guys"" are very non-threatening, which is great considering my 7-year old daughter won't watch movies with scarier characters.  And the scenery and music are great.  I knew the orcas were fake -- although much better than what you see in Jaws movies -- but my daughter didn't, which is all that matters.  And I actually appreciate the fact that they didn't use real orcas in the movie.",1271980800,,637,4.633928571428571
4072722,4,B00364K7DC,"I really liked Bindi Irwin as an actress. She is adorable and full of emotion. In the previous Free Willy movies, the whale was the star. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Free-Willy-Escape-from-Pirate-s-Cove/dp/B0037RP0OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove</a>, Bindi steals the screen. One can definitely detect her voice - and her father's - in quotes like, ""Just because they use big words doesn't mean they're experts."" One thing I really like is that the film shows Bindi doing scientific research to learn how to save Willy - a nice role model for other kids.

However, at times, I thought the movie's pacing was a bit slow and off. When Bindi wasn't on screen, it was hard to pay attention. Unfortunately, the rest of the case and movie doesn't match Bindi's energy.

Most of Orcas were computer-generated, at least for the underwater scenes. I guess some fans might be disappointed - after all, this isn't quite as exciting as a real whale. However, considering the stress that captivity causes real Orcas - as well as all of the trouble filming live Orcas caused in the prior Free Willy movies - I can understand that decision.

Overall, a cute movie for kids and fans of Bindi Irwin. It won't be a classic, but it could launch her on an acting career.",1271808000,,1336,5.175925925925926
4072723,4,B00364K7DC,"Another ""Free Willy"" movie? Oh, brother. That was my initial reaction. When I discovered, however, that Bindi Irwin would be starring in it, I became intrigued. I grew up in Eugene, Oregon, attended the same school as Terri Irwin, and my heart has been linked to their family since Steve Irwin's early success as ""The Crocodile Hunter"" and the later tragedy of his death. How could I not give this movie a chance?

The story is quick-moving and fun-spirited. Bindi is a young girl from Australia whose father gets hurt in an accident. She is forced to go spend six weeks in Capetown, South Africa, with her estranged grandfather, the father of her deceased mother. Beau Bridges plays his role well, giving it a few moments of goofiness and some heartfelt scenes. He and his granddaughter do not hit it off right away. In fact, he is a gambling, unmotivated fellow who runs a downtrodden theme park. A storm brings the theme park an unexpected surprise, though, in the form of a young Orca. ""Willy"" becomes the catalyst for a granddaughter/grandfather relationship, as well as the source of rivalry and conflict from a bigger, better theme park.

The movie has some funny moments and some incredible scenery from the Capetown area. Beau and Bindi give the film a lot of heart. There are one or two slapstick moments, but overall it remains focused on its young female star and her desire to care for animals even while winning over her crusty, but good-natured grandpa. The only real weakness is the use of simulated underwater Orca scenes. They might work well in an aquarium presentation, but they don't do well in a film. And they seemed unnecessary, considering the very real Orca used throughout the movie.

I was pleasantly surprised by ""Free Will: Escape from Pirate's Cove."" It has a message about preserving nature, without getting too preachy about it. It makes good use of adorable and likable Bindi, and it shows that Beau Bridges still has some life in his acting career. My daughters and I enjoyed this together.",1271808000,2,2025,4.796561604584527
8389491,1,B00364K7DC,Awful awful awful! This movie doesn't deserve the name Free Willy. If you want to watch a free willy watch the true movies and not this piece of crap. They are much better and have better story lines. Save your kids memories by showing them the really one. This one should be erased from all minds.,1528416000,,298,4.339285714285714
