8260291,1,B0015XL7SU,This movie is nothing like the original. It's just random interviews with people watching the game. Almost like a corporate commercial for the Red Sox. I can't believe they pass this off as a sequel. I couldn't even finish the movie. It was horrible.,1380672000,,250,4.704545454545454
8260292,5,B0015XL7SU,"If you want a really good laugh and you love baseball, this DVD is for you. Funny, smart and easy to follow, no true Sox fan should be without this DVD. Mike Barnacle interviews several Sox fans during games. Having worked at Fenway Park for a summer, watching these scenes brought back fond memories.",1364428800,,301,4.592592592592593
8260293,5,B0015XL7SU,"Granted I'm a Sox fan, so I'm biased, but I think any baseball fan would enjoy this movie (except maybe Yankees fans). You get to experience the highlights of a great baseball season and the beauty of Fenway Park, but most importantly the excitement, camaraderie, and sheer joy of the fans. Also has player interviews, lots of cameos, and a really great follow-up appearance from one of the fans from the first Still We Believe movie.",1218153600,,434,4.723684210526316
