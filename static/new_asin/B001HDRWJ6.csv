3630272,3,B001HDRWJ6,Well we have several of these science rock and learn videos. The content is pretty decent - but the accent is a mess. Not sure why they would choose to have a thick fake accent to teach children words and information. Some of the words are pronounced differently on the video than Americans would speak it - so that is confusing for learning. & some of it the accent is so thick even I had to really concentrate to hear what word was being said.  Perhaps good for some children - but for any child with a learning disability I think it adds to the chaos.,1383091200,2,554,4.226415094339623
3630273,4,B001HDRWJ6,Another great learning tool. These videos are great for schools or homeschoolers. The children will learn a lot from this video.,1369353600,,128,5.142857142857143
3630274,5,B001HDRWJ6,"This series of dvd's is a great collection of the different sciences there is.  My five year old grandson is hypnotized when we watch this together. He watches them over and over, and can tell you all about the the science he's learned.",1359417600,,236,4.488372093023256
3630275,2,B001HDRWJ6,"I am an elementary science teacher and these dvd's are just talk, not much demonstration or example.  They have won awards but the Schlesinger group of dvd's are much, much better.",1356134400,2,180,4.806451612903226
3630276,5,B001HDRWJ6,This was a great addition to my classroom DVD library. It covers all concepts taught by my science textbook. It was a great unit review for my students to reinforce what they have learned.,1350518400,3,188,4.5588235294117645
3630277,5,B001HDRWJ6,"very good vedio,  my son likes it. the explain is very clear, including the very basic concept of physics.",1295395200,,106,4.578947368421052
3630278,4,B001HDRWJ6,"This is a great video for curious little minds and is presented well for a young audience. I think Grade 5 students would find the presentation style a little young. But because the concepts are well presented from simple to more complex concepts, younger children can easily benefit from the videos. We find The Magic School Bus videos and books a good companion to this video as The Magic School Bus videos are more engaging and the books cover the concepts in a lot more detail. However, this Rock 'n Learn video covers some concepts not covered by The Magic School Bus.",1239494400,2,573,4.627450980392157
3630279,4,B001HDRWJ6,My son since he was 4 years old has loved these videos from Rock n Learn.  My son is high functioning autistic.  We have every single video there is and also the tapes.  Some are better then others but most of them are OUTSTANDING..........,1236384000,11,240,4.409090909090909
3630280,2,B001HDRWJ6,"This video has middle school science concepts but is very animated and almost Barney-like in its annoying characters.  But since I had few choices in this area of science I bought it.  Thought it was a multi-volume set on each topic, but it's ONE video with a few minutes dedicated to each topic.  If you find others pass this by........",1232150400,4,337,4.583333333333333

3630286,5,B001HDRWJ6,Nice educational video for general introduction/review of physical science concepts. This worked well for my 5th graders and they were quiet and attentive because the content interested them.,1413072000,,191,5.857142857142857
3630287,5,B001HDRWJ6,The kids love it.  I have a 6 and 9 yrs. old and they don't mind watching it at all.  I later found out that the teacher in 4 grad. had already introduced one of the DVD to my 9 yrs. old.,1407283200,,187,3.4285714285714284

3630289,3,B001HDRWJ6,"I watched this with my daughters who are 8 and 12.  This DVD is good as a review, but not for one first learning about these subjects.  More time should have been spent on explanation and diagrams or pictures.  So, watch the DVD, write down the words and terms used, teach them to your children in a more understandable way, and then watch this DVD as a review once they fully understand these subjects.",1399420800,4,403,4.418918918918919
3630290,5,B001HDRWJ6,"I do not know what the Rock N Learn videos do differently, but where so many videos confuse him and we have to really go over them to use them as learning tools, Rock N Learn is pure gold for my oldest son. On top of the autism and non verbal my son also has a growth disorder and some other medical conditions. For these reasons we decided that homeschool was the best option for him for now. This is another Rock N Learn video that hasn't disappointed us. We studied some of the concepts in this video this year and I ordered it as a fun, end of year refresher. He played the video 3 times in a row until I made him stop to eat befor going outside and play. As soon as he came back in he wanted to watch it again. Rock N Learn and Liberty Kids both seem to have a similar draw and catch on his attention, but just as important, his retention. He can (and will at the slightest provocation) repeat &/or demonstrate the information in these videos.",1398556800,2,948,4.129729729729729

8308692,2,B001HDRWJ6,"The graphics terrible, voices hard to understand, and content was not presented in the most engaging way.  This was better than the life science one... but overall I just cannot support this series.  It does not really teach anything - only a review.  You cannot select which topic to review in the menu either so its one long run-on.  Not practical for classroom usage let alone for home usage - only for test prep if you can bear with it long enough to watch the entire thing.",1489708800,,478,4.459770114942529
8308693,5,B001HDRWJ6,Bought for my daughter. Fun DVD and she is learning from it.,1471910400,,60,4.083333333333333
8308694,3,B001HDRWJ6,"We have all of the science titles in this series.  This one is not as engaging as the others.  While it does a good job of presenting the information, it didn't grab my grandson's attention so it hasn't been watched as much.  Since he is on the younger side for this series, repetition is important for him to learn.",1466553600,,316,4.322033898305085
