931677,1,6304819773,"I have always enjoyed Dennis Cooper's books and I was very excited to see this movie version.  However, I wasted my money!  The actors in this movie are terrible and the story line does not hold your attention.  The horror  and yet subtle sexiness in the book is completely void in the movie  version.  I am surprised that Mr. Cooper allowed such a poor movie to be  made from such a fine book.",947721600,3,394,4.315068493150685
931852,1,6304819773,"An ugly film that underscores the devolution and depravity of societies where the capitalist ethos of dog eats dog is the norm. In a land where the rich get greedier as the poor get desperate, where they shove their children into cauldrons like Vietnam and Iraq and pollute the environment until the climate goes into a tailspin, mass murderers and serial killers fit right in.
  I watched about half the film looking for some condemnation or warning, but judgments were left to the viewer, and that's not smart in a society like ours.",1185580800,3,535,4.741935483870968
931853,1,6304819773,"It was umm...interesting. If it was the movie's goal to scar me psychologically, mission accomplished. I've seen some freaky horror movies but this one is up there with the most disturbing.",1164499200,4,189,5.129032258064516
931854,5,6304819773,"This movie is very intense to watch. I orginally got this movie was to see what all of the ""hipe"" was about when it was released. I am very glad that I did purchase it because it was one of the first movies to come out that didn't revolve around the AIDS issue. When you are gay, you don't have to hear about it everywhere you turn. It becomes part of our lives.",1159574400,15,362,3.9726027397260273
931855,5,6304819773,"It's been a few months, but I recall being taken aback sometimes and laughing a lot.  Parker Posey is great in this movie.  It is shocking, but not gory.  Powerful, but the power came from the subdued statement it makes.",1127692800,5,220,4.45
931856,5,6304819773,"When ""Frisk"" debuted at the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Film Festival it was met with outrage and shock by filmgoers.  Viewed as homophobic in it's content and portrayal of gay men, the movie has gotten a bad wrap, but forget what people say and pick up this hot flick for mature audiences and see it for yourself.
A gorgeous cast of hot guys who do nude scenes (most notably handsome adult film actor Michael Gunther in the lead), some tight, if not artsy camera and lens work, as well as a more cohesive storyline that pulls together the arguably complicated tale as penned originally by author Dennis Cooper, make this a noteworthy film.
Not for the faint of heart, content includes controversial portrayals of BD/S&M, underground leather and fetish culture, as well as homicide, suicide, snuff and carries a generally moody atmosphere from the get go.
Interestingly enough, there is some humor to be found, but admittedly it's pretty dark, and while I wouldn't consider this film to be a black comedy per se, it does carry certain elements unique to the particular genre
Cast also includes Craig Chester and Parker Posey in supporting roles, and a cameo from Alexis Arquette as a punk for hire.
It needs to be said that the physical content of the film is largely symbolic to the plot and events (more so here than in Cooper's world), and comes down to a simple theme of sexual exploration.
If you collect art house erotica on DVD, this is a highly reccomended film.",1088380800,49,1472,4.705426356589148
931857,4,6304819773,"This is an excellent film. I think it is also a tough film for people to judge the real merits of, because the subject matter is difficult, and the word of mouth has been that it is a gory film, that also gives the gay community a black eye.  I think all this prevents people from properly appreciating the film.
Its drama folks, its about murder.
In truth it is not as gory as many slasher or recent war films are. And it certainly is not an attack on the gay community in any way.
So get some courage, get the film, don't prejudge it. I think if you do you will see it is a much better film than the(very incorrect!) buzz would have you believe.",1027987200,15,647,4.094488188976378
931858,2,6304819773,"Call me old-fashioned, but the book is so much more intense than the film..... I rented this movie after wanting to see it for ages but never had access to such movies. I was let down. Parker Posey and her lover were great, but the other actors including the lead man semmed like they had read the script only hours before filming. The book is better, (...) read it. xo",1008028800,2,369,4.285714285714286

7877910,4,6304819773,"Something different. Fantasies of a gay sociopath that leave you wondering in the end if they actually happened or not. Violent and gory, but not as sexually explicit as advertised. A few very brief junk shots. Picture and sound quality not that great. I'm sure the critics would not have found it as gross if it had been female hookers slashed up with knives. Surprise! Gay people can be sociopaths too.",1432166400,,404,4.704225352112676

7877913,1,6304819773,"I bought this pile on Amazon after being duped again by bogus reviews. This film does not make it on any level: dramatic or erotic. It is boring and repetitious unless you like white BVDs. The models are mostly mediocre with mostly mediocre bodies. I'm not sure that it has a real plot. The photography is dull, dim, dark, and fuzzy. The acting and dialogue are bad. The scenery/backgrounds are all cheapo. Just when I thought this movie could not get any worse, the broads showed up! How can anyone be bothered to make such a piece of junk? Of course the reviewers have to lie, there is nothing good to be said about this thing. Only a movie masochist could like it. Let them watch it; steer clear.",1377302400,,699,4.426356589147287
7877914,3,6304819773,A not so great adaptation of a risk taking novel.  Do not worry if you miss this.  Read the book.,1373155200,,97,3.8
7877915,5,6304819773,"First, I'm a fan of Alexis Arquette. His spot in the film just sends me. Now the movie is a bit..er a lot gross. It's good looking gay men acting out some very sadistic fantasies. Things I have fantasized doing to a couple of my ex's. Notwithstanding, I,of course would never do such, but it's there lurking in the back of my mind. Don't laugh at me, and don't touch my makeup! There is a theory that societies that supress artistic  expressions of sexuality and brutality wind up acting them out for real, ie...the Nazis. Those where freedom of speech allows for such expression are far more healthy. We must be in good shape then. Really this film is a shocker, but that's good. It's just a movie afterall. Mind you, the operative word here is FANTASY! As long as you know the difference between real and imaginary, you are okay.",1347494400,2,831,4.503311258278146
7877916,1,6304819773,"I haven't read the book (as most of the viewers here), but I am not so keen to do it after I had seen this crap.
The film is plain ugly.
All the scenes of violence bring nothing to the film. I think they are just there to disgust some people and to shock others.
I give two thumbs up to all negative reviews posted here.",1309219200,,320,3.8636363636363638
7877917,4,6304819773,"I love Dennis Cooper stories...i loved this movie. Not for the faint of heart or probably even the Dennis Cooper purists....

the story follows our main character through his strange and dark desires and what might or might not have happened...

the soundtrack has many tunes from Coil and is a highlight for me as well as much of it was never released elsewhere...

my one big complaint was Parker Posey and her cohort....i love Parker Posey, but she substitutes in here for a character in the book who is a skinhead being used by the main character for some muscle and getting dirty work done...Parker Posey is not that person....

overlook that one (big) distraction and you might enjoy this twisted story....",1303084800,2,712,4.764227642276423
7877918,1,6304819773,"This movie missed the boat at every turn.  Frisk was a rough alienating novel where the main characters used S&M sex as a balm for their feelings of alienation.  The woefully miscast actors were not up to the task of the complex emotions that should have guided this piece.  Parker Posey always wonderful was reduced to playing a stand-in for some of the more nefarious characters in the novel the sadistic germans who assisted the lead in their dangerous sex games that ended in murder.
There's little skin on display for the voyeur crowd - was anyone really dying to see Alexis naked?

All-in-all infuriating and dissatifying.",1240185600,4,628,4.841121495327103
