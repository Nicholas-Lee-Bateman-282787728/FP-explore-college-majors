8325253,5,B000J6GU2C,"I recently purchased a Ralph Lauren Stencil.  I knew this stencil ""how-to"" would help me.  I followed the directions given on the tape.  Stenciled the front of a capecod thomasville bachelor's chest.  It looks very ""Horchow-furniture-like"" and just exactly the look I was wanting.
