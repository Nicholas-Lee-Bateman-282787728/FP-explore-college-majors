8527294,5,B001GRTPEI,"One of my favorite operas and this version from Sophia, Bulgaria does an incredible job of recreating 1597 when Tsar Boris Godunov was crowned Tsar of Russia. The singers are just fabulous and the setting is live, outside a cathedral.",1477094400,,234,4.875
8527295,5,B001GRTPEI,"Nice idiomatic performance from Sofia, Bulgaria, generally well-sung. The staging backdrop of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral adds realism and superb scenic support. This recording will not necessarily replace the Nesterenko  performances, nor the classic Russian 1950s film with Alexander Pirogov, but it is, nevertheless, a nice addition to the videography of Mussorgsky's masterpiece.",1474934400,2,386,6.283018867924528

8527297,4,B001GRTPEI,"It occurred to me while watching this that the rise of ""director's theater"" in opera has had an effect even on the way we perceive singers. There was a time when we could see a new bass in such a role as Boris Godunov and we could say something of ""his"" view of the character, what kind of Boris he was. Siepi, Christoff, London, Ghiaurov, Talvela...all of them sang this role in various theaters over a period of years with different conductors (conductors were more likely to be the powerful figures shaping the performances in those days), and maybe the portrayal evolved and the details differed from one date to another, but there was something personal they took with them. Some were warmer and more noble; others were more fearsome and intimidating, or unbalanced. The effect of Siepi was very different from that of Christoff, for example, even when they sang substantially the same edition. Nowadays, when I first see and hear someone like Ren Pape in the role, even in a fairly tame and non-interventionist production such as the Stein/Wadsworth hybrid of the 2010-11 Met season, I am not sure how much of the mild-mannered ""family man"" Boris I see is his own choice and how much is imposed from without.

There has been no more controversial practitioner of Regietheater in our present century than Calixto Bieito, whose breakthrough, in fact, was right at the turn of the millennium. People still are talking about ""that BALLO with the toilets"" at the Liceu in Barcelona 15 years ago. It invariably gets brought up when anti-Regietheater operagoers rail against the excesses of the modern directors, and more people have an opinion on it than could have fit into the Liceu on 365 consecutive days. This is not for lack of equally polarizing Bieito productions since. He has stayed busy. He has a lot to say in his booklet interview here about power being founded on crime, on an absence of scruples and values, on wealth acquired at the expense of people who remain ignorant of the ways in which they are being robbed, and his production too has something of a leftist treatise about it. You think about *him* and *his* views when you watch and listen to it, more than about Mussorgsky, to say nothing of the performers. About all one can say about them, the cast, is that they commit to carrying out their director's ideas, and several of them do so with distinction. I finished this feeling very negative toward the character of Boris Godunov, and so did the people watching with me, including one big fan of the work who has seen other productions and heard other recordings. But we cannot ""blame"" (or credit) the young bass singing Boris Godunov, Alexander Tsymbalyuk. He is a cog in the machine, in a way that those basses above (even Ghiaurov, who was still singing the role in the '90s) never were.

The choral and orchestral work here (forces of the Bavarian State Opera under Kent Nagano) is spectacularly good, lean and swift and with very clear textures even when Mussorgsky's mixture thickens. This provides a framework that both grounds and seduces; it may not look like what we expect to see for BORIS GODUNOV, but it certainly sounds like it. Then, on stage, Bieito turns everything on its head. Pimen sings of the value of historians while falsifying history, ripping pages *out* of a book that seems to be some official record, but furtively drawing Grigory's attention to that which he is discarding (Grigory photographs some of the pages on the floor, stuffs others in his bag). He also arms Grigory with a knife before sending him on his way. The bereaved Xenia is a vapid baby-doll, either stupid or inebriated to the point of near-catatonia (Boris and the nurse confiscate a fifth of vodka from her purse). When Boris mentions the rumors of his role in her fianc's death, it is as though something penetrates a haze, and she lashes out ineffectually. It is difficult to say what point is being made with Fyodor, who, if he is to be taken as male, must be a male in some state of gender transition (this ""son,"" sung by a woman, wears a schoolgirl's outfit, makeup, and a very feminine hairstyle, although is acted like a tomboy, and shoots Boris with a slingshot in protest at being sent away). The body count is high: the inn scene, St. Basil's, and the opera itself all end with unscripted murders. The execution of the Simpleton (by a young girl, armed by and physically guided by Schuisky) is especially gruesome.

This is all challenging and provocative, and to give him his due, Bieito has achieved mastery of his craft. The production is visually arresting and its tone is consistent. Bieito knows how to lead his audience to the conclusions he wants them to reach, and I found myself thinking often of the way events on the stage mirrored current events or those of recent history. The Grigory, Sergey Skorokhodov, denied the Polish Act and Kromy Forest, makes a remarkable impression in what is left to him. With even less to work with, so does Markus Eiche, the Chelkalov, a slick pol emanating self-satisfaction as he moves through the rabble in the Prologue, playing his role of ""good cop"" to the hilt (the ""bad cops"" are violent riot police who, of course, do everything they do with his authorization, or that of his superiors). Tareq Nazmi has an electric stage presence as a heavily pierced ""punk"" Mityucha. Boris himself, played by Tsymbalyuk, has never seemed smaller, weaker, pettier; his death has never been less moving. There is not a wet eye in the house. Bieito even undercuts him in the death scene by having Grigory murdering the Nurse and both of the children behind him, so Boris is pointing and saying ""This is your tsar"" to an empty space his now dead ""son"" (?) no longer inhabits. Tsymbalyuk has an attractive voice that I would like to hear as Figaro or Leporello, and in bel canto roles. One of my party was more impressed by the veteran Kotscherga (Pimen), and commented that he would rather have had Kotscherga in the title role, but that would not have worked in this production. It needed to be a young, superficially attractive and virile leader who, in Bieito's bleak view, is impotent and vacuous, far less than meets the eye. Boris makes his acceptance speech in the Prologue from a point of elevation, and then he's brought down to stage level in the subsequent acts and immediately diminished. It is not only the edition chosen (all 1869, so considerably tighter than usual, 139 minutes) that makes this seem less grand, less ""epic"" than BORIS GODUNOV as we usually think of it. It all feels as though Mussorgsky's opera is being used as a tool of protest, alarm, warning.

It's difficult to come to a conclusion in terms of recommending or not recommending this, so I award it four stars for meeting its aims. There was considerable skill here, and some vision with it, and I was never bored. The one person present who had no familiarity with BORIS GODUNOV expressed an interest in seeing something more traditional to go with this (such as Tarkovsky's seminal production of the 1872 plus St. Basil's Scene that is on DVD, conducted by Gergiev). Maybe the Bieito must work that way, as the alternative view of a theatrical maverick.",1423267200,5,7210,4.728934817170111

8527299,5,B001GRTPEI,"Of course not everybody will like this regietheater production.  But those who dismiss it as a director's misguided attempt to transpose the work into our times or impose a narrow personal interpretation should know that any criticism of the ""this-is-not-what-Mussorgsky-intended""-type is rather presumptuous.  We don't know what Mussorgsky ""really"" wanted - as far as I know, he didn't leave behind detailed instructions what he wanted a production to look like or not look like one and a half centuries later.  We only have the work itself.  If this opera is any good (and I think it is), then there are many ways to look at it, and every generation has to find its own approach.  The director of this production, Calixto Bieito, doesn't see this as a religious work, he sees it as a tale on the corruption of power and the suppression of the people, at all times.  That doesn't strike me as going against the work.  The production does not feature Boris with a long white beard, and the coronation scene isn't very glamorous (in fact, there is no set to speak of during the first scenes, so you can concentrate on the singers and the choir).  If you want a production with lots of gold on stage, I am sure there are others DVDs out there that deliver.  This one has a lot going for it in other aspects.  First, it features a relatively young singer as Boris.  I think Alexander Tsymbaliuk is an excellent choice for the part.  Second, the production uses the shorter original (1868/9) version, which I think is  more convincing than the later versions.  Bieito certainly adds a few ""strange"" things (like the brutal beating of a man, or pictures of modern leaders in the first scene), but it is not at all excessive and wouldn't keep me from watching this again (and again and again).  Overall, this is an excellent performance with no weak link in the cast, and Kent Nagano does a great job with orchestra and chorus as well.  I think that Bieito presents a perfectly valid interpretation of this great opera.",1397347200,12,2013,4.676136363636363
8527300,1,B001GRTPEI,"First of all, google the name Calixto Bieito and run through the first five entries, especially the one in Wikipaedia.  These will give you abundant information on his track record & why not to waste your time / money on this latest one.

In his conception and staging, Bieito throws out the religious intoxication and mystical desperation definitive of the Russian masses envisaged by Mussorgsky and replaces it with his humanist, reformist message that the people everywhere need a break and that all rulers everywhere are remote.  ""Power to the People!"" would solve everything.  Bieito's social location is not in any special country.  It embodies a trend that has been occuring widely here and there in recent times.  It's very reminiscent of 1984 --- both the opera and the film starring Richard Burton.  This entirely satisfies Bieito.  In an interview in the program notes, he acknowledges that his humanist rage at the callousness of those in power today drives his conceptions: ""The core part of directing is the need to express something that's inside you and has to come out.  It's a really strong need.""

***** It would be better if he had a strong need to express what is inside Mussorgsky's music / vision, instead of shoving his own agenda forward and turning the production into a form of psychodrama to air his own ideas. *******

In the program notes, Bieito makes the silly statement that Mussorgsky's Boris Gudunov ""depicts .  .  .  a society that is very similar to today's, where the social, economic and cultural distinctions between a minority and a majority are steadily growing.  Where the broad mass of people doesn't know why, where or by whom the decisions that affect their daily lives are made.""  With this orientation Bieito airily cancels Mussorgsky's Orthodox Christian vision, the delirious yearning to have Boris partake of an apotheois that will answer their needs to have a ruler saturated by the blessings of God.  Bieito offers us instead a secular plea for better participatory democracy, the clean up of city hall and an end to ""the acquisition of wealth at the expense of the people.  .  .  The common people in Boris Gudunov can't rebel  (because] they're like us, passive creatures, the victim of manipulation by huge economic structures.""  This call to revolution and a more just society is closer to Che Guevara or Rosa Luxemburg than the immersion of Mussorgsky in the mystical, religious, collective unconscious of the Russian people that's not interchangeable with populations elsewhere.  A line from the chorus says, ""to be Russian is to take on eternal sadness"" --- this is Christian resignation without a glance toward the kind of reform so dear to Bieito and that, as he says, he personally ""has this strong need to express"".

Bieito's humanist message, as he spells it out in the program notes, is big hearted and humane but hardly different from that of any socially conscious undergraduate.  That Mussorgsky should be eviscerated for it and staging set up for thugs in an alley + all purpose fascist uniforms with religion banished entirely shows us a stage director of vain glorious appetites.
And the production is grotesque and ill fitting as a result.",1394150400,18,3212,4.958878504672898
