8460212,4,B00571SL58,"I recently purchased the dvd Doctor in Love. I found that the movie itself was just great but the dvd seemed to be a little off. It's very slight, but there is either something wrong with the color, speed or something. I just can't put my finger on it. For being digitally remastered it's just a little disappointing. I will say that after watching it a couple of times you just get use to it, you have no choice. If anyone bought this dvd just for the handsome actor Michael Craig they will not be disappointed. The story is funny and a little strange, but that is typical for this series. It is a really good movie, better than the other Doctor movies.",1319414400,,654,4.32520325203252
8460213,4,B00571SL58,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""DOCTOR IN LOVE"" (1960) (98 min/Color) -- Starring: Michael Craig, Virginia Maskell, James Robertson Justice, Leslie Phillips, Joan Sims, Liz Fraser, Irene Handl, Fenella Fielding, Nicholas Parsons, Carole Lesley

Directed by: Ralph Thomas

Another VCI restored film from the British Invasion vaults.

No Dirk Bogarde in this one, this is a downer for his many fans of the Doctor Series.  This, the third sequel to Doctor In The House, Doctor In Love, sees the temporary absence of Dirk Bogarde's Simon Sparrow (he returned for Doctor In Distress); instead chief medical duties fall to Michael Craig's Doctor Hare, an equally young and inexperienced young Doctor.

Though James Robertson Justice is wonderful, his Lancelot Spratt seems to get better as they go along. His performance in this, as he is about to go under the knife himself, is indescribable, and not to be missed. Priceless comedy!  James Robinson Justice, once again playing Sir Lancelot Spratt. Though off-screen for quite awhile, his scenes are the most memorable of the film and, as always, he never fails to make us laugh out loud.  James Robertson Justice as Sir Lancelot Spratt is my favorite in the series.  Its a shame that his appearances in these films always seem to be quickly and over so soon, wish he had more screen time.

I have all these Doctors' films on DVD !  I have always loved Leslie Philips and he never fails to give a hilarious performance with his ill-planned sexual adventures ! He's much funnier than Dirk Bogarde who played in some of the initial ""Doctor"" films.

Can't help feeling sorry for Craig, as he shares scenes with such great scene-stealers as Leslie Philips (in his `Doctor' debut as the aptly named Doctor Burke), Irene Handle, Joan Sims and Liz Fraser. The last two (together with Philips) were at the time mainstays of the `Carry On' films and help bring a touch of sauce to the proceedings.

Doctor In Love isn't perfect is obviously from a more innocent age, but if your willing to give it a try, it remains perfect Sunday afternoon viewing with your favorite beverage and snack.
