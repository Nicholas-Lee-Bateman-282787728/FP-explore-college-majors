8054869,3,B0007ZZ2Q0,"SIX SHOOTER WESTERNS is a budget-priced VHS tape crammed full with a half-dozen vintage cowboy ""programmers."" Transfer quality of these unrestored 60 to 70 year-old films is adequate. Of greater concern to the potential buyer should be the tape's SLP speed-- it may not track well in some VCRs. (This product is not available on DVD.)
