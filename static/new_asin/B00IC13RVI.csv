6256713,5,B00IC13RVI,"Cathnafola is one of those true paranormal investigations that will give you chills!  I started watching the DVD with much anticipation, and I was not disappointed!  The atmosphere throughout the film is duly creepy, and an intense feeling of expectation permeates the entire investigation.  There are some very surprising and shocking moments during the investigators' time there.  And the bonus investigation of Leap Castle is equally chilling, with more unexpected moments.  Chris Halton and Jason Figgis, along with everyone else involved in this project have done a great job on the entire film.  Very intense and very engrossing!  This definitely gets a five star rating.  More, if I had my way!",1403654400,9,701,5.252252252252252
6256714,4,B00IC13RVI,"The History, Story... Of these places, as Chris Halton describes & actually Experiences! A Chilling Film ""CATINAFOLA""!
I haven't seen ""Leap into Darkness"", Yet!... I am saving it for tonight  in the USA! I Cannot Wait. ""Leap"" Castle  has been of my interest for a while now!... Another ""Very Active"" place!...

6256715,5,B00IC13RVI,"I saw Cathnafola at the Irish Film Institute Horrorthon. It is one hell of a scary movie.  The hair on your neck just keeps creeping up. Looking forward to getting it on DVD and seeing the bonus film, which I don't know.
I'm updating now that I've bought the DVD and have also now seen the bonus film Leap of Faith. It's an equally chilling account of the haunting of Ireland's Castle Leap. Seriously creepy history there as told by the castle's somewhat weird owner. Another Haunted Earth gem, and a great DVD to own.",1395273600,7,518,4.4526315789473685
8640753,1,B00IC13RVI,This was horrible! Not even silly entertainment. Just boring footage of three guys acting scared in the dark. The best part of the film was the kids horrible amateur shots. Don't spend a dime on this! At least free will only waste your time.,1479859200,,241,4.5
8640754,1,B00IC13RVI,This was absolutely disappointing. All I watched was three guys getting scared in the woods. If you're going to be a paranormal investigator be a little more professional and not scream at every noise you hear. I want to see a real investigation and actual evidence and not some guy saying I feel this and I feel that and I sense it. The guys get scared every second is a little annoying. And then one guy gets supposedly possessed. Like really? This is a troll of a film. I GOT TROLLED,1473120000,,486,4.351648351648351
8640755,3,B00IC13RVI,"I dislike that green screen look of the performance actors where they make as if something's going on around them with night vision focused on their faces with a light on nearby that washes their facial expressions. It's stupid. Blah!
Oooo there's a ghost over there and a dust bunny in the corner, but I actually saw an old hand lamp rise up off of the floor once in real life so I know real ghosts do exist. But this is created.",1467331200,,430,4.2560975609756095

8640757,1,B00IC13RVI,Are all of you guys crazy? This was totally fake and lame... They made a 30 min Paranormal TV show into a lame ass movie! The screams were clearly added and EVPs don't sound like that.. They make it seem like they had EVPs set through out the house and this was not the fact. EVPs are always followed by the crew saying things or provoking. The EVPs you heard were as if they were not moving around and even if they stopped to records EVPs what they got was totally fake! Waste of time! Yeah this is Ghost Hunters the movie.. LAME LAME LAME,1436486400,,540,4.152380952380953
8640758,5,B00IC13RVI,"This is a wonderful film. A story based on the truth. The intro is already very attractive and stylish, something that is expanded over the entire film. The entire film radiates huge quality, and this in every way concerning the composition and everything else and not to forget the play of colours, and that all made the film to that what it really is : an artwork of high level that entertains from the first second to the last one. It is pleasant to watch Cathnafola,... because it is all brought so natural by everyone. It is also brought in a quiet way, and by that it has some kind of hypnotic attraction. There is a lot of artistic material, such as the photographs of that place. And the story itself; the music and sounds, which are perfect in tune with the situations and the different scenes. That all together makes it to a film who cannot be compaired with any movie I know, and all that makes Cathnafola just a level higher than most movies. Also the subject of the paranormal is brought in the way as it is... no exaggeration. It is the way it is ! Chris Halton, since many years being a paranormal investigator, is a psychic on probably all the 5 senses, such as to see, to smell, to hear, to feel... that makes it to a reality film! Congratulations to everyone involved !",1427155200,2,1288,4.393305439330544
8640759,5,B00IC13RVI,"Received my DVD and popped it right in.  It starts off with a film done by kids checking out this creepy place, and it ends up being sent in to Chris Halton.  Chris' own investigation kept me on the edge of my seat.  Can't wait to see more.  Also, lots of Class A EVPs.  Thank you, Chris!",1426723200,3,288,3.982456140350877
8640760,1,B00IC13RVI,"I was surprised by the 5 positive reviews of this movie.  I love this whole genre, but...I don't think I could even give anything away, because nothing happens.  It begins with the narrative, nice, spooky feel.  Then it goes to the 3 kids who ""hear"" things, badly lit, I understand, they were going for the really amateurish atmosphere, and this they succeeded with. Then we're introduced to Haunted Earth, led by Chris Halton, and he and 2 others go to Cathnafola to ""confirm"" this amateur video, because it seems kind of suspicious to them.  Chris immediately feels oppressive evil, but it's just a bunch of pointing-because what he sees, of course the camera doesn't pick up.  And basically, that's it, kids.  They drive away and later talk about their experiences, Chris deciding that things are not  concluded and they will have to return with more people.  It's kind of like a very long trailer.  If you absolutely have to see it, try to rent, so you won't be out of your money as well as 71 minutes of your life.",1413849600,7,1019,4.616666666666666
8640761,5,B00IC13RVI,"Waiting for daylight leisure to watch the Leap into Darkness segment, meanwhile...

Would rate Cathnafola as a riveting documentary for novice ghost-hunters.  It's a cautionary tale that reveals underestimating the power of an unseen opponent while overestimating the strength of one's team can land even a veteran paranormal investigator in the soup.

Psychic empath Chris Halton appears in this program; however, this is not a typical Haunted Earth U.K. production.  Some content and adult language is unsuitable for younger viewers.",1404000000,4,535,5.65
8640762,5,B00IC13RVI,"I never knew about Cathnafola house until I saw this movie, Chris Halton and his Haunted Earth  team investigate probably their scariest paranormal investigation yet.
I'm a huge fan of Chris Halton and the investigations that he does ... anyway more about the film because that's what I'm supposed to review:
The film is wonderfully put together and I thought everything suited the movie really well, I was specially attracted to the film's score soundtrack and the wonderful photography.
Remember, this is a real life film and it is not fictional, things that happened in the movie itself really happened.  What you see is what you get. They also recorded, in my opinion, some of the best EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) I have ever heard.
It was so scary at some points I didn't have anybody to hold on to so I had to clutch the pillow I just found on the chair and started shaking dramatically like a little girl at some moments, while other parts made me speechless!!! it was a movie that made me sleep with a night light on that night. I enjoyed it very much.",1403827200,4,1065,4.6
