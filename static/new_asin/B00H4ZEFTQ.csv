6132390,2,B00H4ZEFTQ,Season 1 was just fine.  Season 2 is slow and clunky.  it could have been worse.  It seems to have been made just to cash in on the 1st season's sucess.,1392854400,8,152,3.838709677419355
6132391,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,Season 1 was incredible and I am so excited to order season 2.  My husband and I watched season 1 with anticipation of a second season being released .. now I can hardly wait to watch it.,1392422400,7,187,4.054054054054054
6132392,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"The January airing of this thrilling crime/spy investigative series' 2nd season brought back the cast's key 3 nucleus. Some of the most intelligent British women during WWII were brought to Bletchley as code breakers. They helped win the war. At that time it was a secret, hidden operation, and remained a national secret for decades afterward. This dramatic series reveaed some of the history and aftermath. In the early 1950s Bletchley gals have moved on to marriage and kids. However, the stellar code breaking abilities are yet keen in the minds of these women. That can't be forgotten so easily. And now, they operate independently, without protection of the British forces.

The second season expanded to four episodes, one more than season 1. The story continued from one episode to a second. That pattern was repeated for a second lengthy two-part drama. The suspense never slowed, so expect no difference in series two. The women that found themselves caught between wartime and post-war normalcy were tough, smart, strong, and determined. Yes, it is a female focused series, but content is for all who enjoy strong thriller/suspense and a challenge to never being sure of the conclusion. Code breaking revolved around patterns, and a pattern could change in a heartbeat. So could lives. A realistic look at what it was probably like for the gals who worked at wartime Bletchley, followed by their struggle to blend into the subdued British lifestyle after the war.

It's intense period suspense with costumes, sets, and props doing the appropriate 1950s era. I know, I lived during those years.

6132420,3,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Season 2 of the Bletchley Circle differs from Season 1, which consisted of a single storya hunt for a serial killer in London.  Season 2 includes two completely separate stories, each 90 minutes in length, divided into two 45-minute segments.  In some ways the lead character (in an ensemble cast), Anna Maxwell Martin (who plays Susan) leaves the series after the first episode in season 2.  Her husband has taken a job in Bombay and she has accompanied him.

The two stories are very reminiscent of Foyles War, the series which serves as the inspiration for The Bletchley Circle.  (The subsidiary material with disc 2 recounts the production companys challenges with regard to dressing sets that include modern technology, signage, etc.; if you close your eyes you would think that you were watching the similar material that focused on the making of Foyles War.)  The first concerns secret military experiments with chemical weapons; the second concerns the exploitation of the still-existing black market (we are now in the 1950s, a decade after the wars end).  The traffickers in cigarettes, hose and perfume also traffick in young women from Eastern Europe who are lured to England in hopes of finding honest work.

As with season 1, the tension is unrelieved.  There is no humor, no light asides and, unfortunately, no memorable dialogue or reflections on the world of postwar England that might clarify the suffering and pain or at least add some depth to it.  I was reminded of the comparable ethos of the miniseries The Night Manager.  The thematic content remains pretty much the same: here is a group of very talented women whose abilities are underutilized and whose pasts must remain a secret.  That concept is enough to build a series on, particularly if and when it calls on the womens experiences at Bletchley to solve a crime (which is finally done in episode 2 of the second series).

Ensemble casts are a challenge for a writer; that is why so many crime stories involve a protagonist and, often, a sidekick.  The great stories (Homicide: Life on the Street and The Wire, e.g.) enjoy superior writing and far more engaging characters.  There are very few successful ensemble casts in novelistic crime fiction.  One thinks of Salvatore Lombino/Evan Hunter/Ed McBains 87th Precinct series or Andrew Vachsss Burke series, but these are very difficult to do.  McBain often narrows his emphasis to a single character or set of partners (as in Homicide: Life on the Street) and while Vachsss Burke thinks of himself as primus inter pares he is really the protagonist of the series.  In The Bletchley Circle the women are not nearly as differentiated as they could be and they have a habit of investigating together, with three or four of them walking, talking, studying records, and so forth.  You need very memorable characters to make this work.

There are other issues.  One is plausibility.  One of the characters is depicted as possessing a (literal) photographic memory, in which she can stare at two pages of complex numerical data for a few seconds and remember it all in total detail.  She makes Brian Memory Lane of New Tricks look forgetful, New Tricks being another ensemble cast series which is far more sophisticated in its conception, far better written and far more memorable in its details.

In addition to problems of plausibility there are serious issues with plot.  In one episode, e.g., we are introduced to a particularly hateful and disgusting villain who is never brought to justice and who is, more or less, forgotten at the end of the story.  That same story (SPOILER) turns in part on the old chestnut of a bent cop at the Yard who warns the bad guys and protects them from police investigations.  That individual is never revealed and, more important, punished.

I love the conception of The Bletchley Circle and love to see brave women bringing bad people to justice (or terminating them with extreme prejudice), but this series needs the writerly hand of an Anthony Horowitz or Sally Wainwright to make all that happen in a memorable way.  Period costuming and material culture details are important but not enough to carry the day.",1468627200,2,4176,4.908831908831909

6132427,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,Clever women in their criminal sleuthing lives post their amazing WWII contributions. How did this not get renewed?  AMAZON!!  This is perfect for your online video programming.  This is so worthy of AMAZON's renewal...how about it???,1460764800,,234,5.444444444444445
6132428,4,B00H4ZEFTQ,"The second season of Bletchley Circle has two two-part stories (so four 44-minute episodes). In the first story (""Blood on Their Hands"") one of the other women from Bletchley has been convicted of murder and is about to be hanged. The weird thing is she mounted no legal defense at all. Also the victim is a former lover from Bletchley, a famous scientist. The ladies are on the case, though Susan is reluctant, seeing how she was almost killed last season. They promise not to get so involved this time. That falls through pretty quickly, creating interpersonal tension along with the investigative tension.

In the second story (""Uncustomed Goods""), Millie's sideline work selling black market goods has become her main source of income. Unfortunately, her supplier has been playing fast and loose with the money leading both of them into hot water with the Maltese ""importers"" he's been scamming. They are taken to a secret hotel where Marta, the head of Maltese smugglers, interrogates them. Millie finds out they are importing more than booze, smokes, and perfume--families are paying to smuggle their daughters out from behind the Iron Curtain. Marta promises to set the daughters up with good jobs, but it's clear they are sold as sex slaves. The rest of the Circle try to find out what happened to Millie but as usual the police are not very responsive. So they get to work. Can they get Millie out and bust up the smuggling and sex trafficking ring?

Both stories are good though I found the first story better. The villain in the second story, Marta, was just okay, making the story less compelling. Also, adding a new character in the first story made that character more dramatically expendable; I never thought Millie in the second story would ever not get out of the bad situation. While not as great as the first series, these stories are still good, solid dramas.",1460419200,,1879,4.832298136645963

Both Bletchley Circle thrillers ratchet up the suspense nicely and then throw it all away in the last few minutes of the dnouement and end abruptly.  Season ! especially presents tight well written  thriller  that kept me on edge until the disappointing slapped together  end,
How could such a good writer plot such weak endings?  I like to savor stories not regret the time spent watching them.",1426377600,,541,5.068181818181818

Was sorry to see Anna Maxwell Martin leave the show and hope she will be back. In the meantime, we have an interesting newcomer and her daughter in the first episode that offers a great deal of tension and new characters we come to care about quickly. Can't wait for more programs in this series.

6132531,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"I was hooked on this miniseries within the first 5 minutes of viewing. The set design caught me, the whole concept of codebreakers during WWII lured me, and the role of women in such a facility, factual or imaginary, fascinated. This (very) mini-series had to be a keeper, I thought. And it sent me to the library and to the internet to do some historical digging. Aha! There is some factual data to back up this story.

Many others have reviewed this series, and I will not be a copying (nor, redundant) voice. But, I must say how very disappointed I am that the series ended at Season 2, and that Season 2 did not quite live up to the first, albeit, it was very good if not excellent. To say that the shows cancellation after the second season is a let down would be an understatement. It was widely viewed at home and in the U.S. Another good, popular show gone to the numbers game.",1418774400,,885,4.331325301204819

6132538,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"A well done, complex period piece of detective fiction. It has that perfect mix of interpersonal melodrama and balls out detectives in danger plot. The time period is an out of joint moment in Britain particularly for women who have been shoved back into the kitchen after being shown they could have so much more and this vicious social impulse realistically makes detectives who would be hypersensitive to criminal wrongs others might not see. The dialogue is smart and even if you do figure out the villain before you are meant to you still enjoy watching this drama unfold.",1417219200,,577,4.838383838383838

I watched the first episode alone thinking that since it had a female cast line up, that my husband wouldn't enjoy it.

6132638,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Like Season 1, The Bletchley Circle has the five main characters - all women who worked at Bletchley Park as code breakers during World War II trying to find contentment back in civilian life sans the importance and excitement of making such a vital contribution to winning the war against Hitler. Imagine all that these women did and how significant their lives must have seemed only to be relegated to being a ""housewife"" or teacher, or sales clerk afterwards? To make matters worse, they were obligated to sign and comply with The Official Secrets Act of 1939, which prevented these ladies from even telling their own husbands and/or family members what they did and how they contributed toward saving the world from a deranged human monster.

The stories center around a mystery typically involving a murder or murders and the women using their extraordinary skills to detect patterns and garner clues that even professional police inspectors did not have the ability or insight to do.

I can't say that I've seen a finer and more entertaining show - especially one so centered around true events (and I'm comparing this with shows such as Breaking Bad, Downton Abbey, Mad Men, Mr. Selfridge's, and Call The Midwives). The actors are superb, and the Directors, set styling and scenes are top notch.

This time around there are 4 excellent episodes (instead of three in the 1st season) with two episodes focusing on two different stories - both equally compelling mysteries involving murders and featuring the fascinating way each woman brings her special skill to help solve the crime.

We lose the considerable talents of Anna Maxwell Martin as Susan Gray in the fifth episode as she and her husband, Timothy (played by Mark Dexter) and their children relocate to Australia for his work. I imagine in real life that Susan just had too many other role opportunities to turn down in order to do the entire 4 episodes. But our loss is compensated by the introduction of another woman who worked at Bletchley with the women, Hattie Morahan as Alice Merren. Alice is actually embroiled in the 1st episode of this series as a suspect in a murder which we learn she did not commit, but she refuses to prove her innocence (except to the other women) as she is protecting someone dear to her.

As I said in my review of Bletchley Circle Season 1, this show is intriguing and entertaining on so many levels since it's based on real historical events and it shows women characters in strong inspiring roles who are attractive FOR their characters and yet easy to relate to.

Before this show, I've never taken time to write or petition for a show to be continued but I actually did that in hopes that some smart producer and distributor would be wise enough to produce a 3rd season. I'd love to see a third season as there is such a shortage of really, really good programming.

One additional note of interest: Kate Middleton, a.k.a. Duchess of Cambridge, and wife of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge visited Bletchley Park in June in Buckinghamshire, where her paternal grandmother Valerie Glassborow was a ""Duty Officer"" during World War II. Hopefully, that will garner more attention to this excellent series and maybe that 3rd season so many of us fans are wishing for!",1405814400,3,3269,4.816399286987522

If you saw the first one, you will absolutely Love this one!!",1403913600,,292,4.634615384615385
6132668,4,B00H4ZEFTQ,"As mysteries, these episodes were pretty conventional: the plots were about a conspiracy, a murder, human trafficking... What adds dimension to this show is portraying the position of women in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Women who contributed their intellectual talent at Bletchley Park during WWII were expected to revert to being housewives or clerks who were not respected by even their husbands.

The show seems to blame the British Official Secrets Act that prohibit people who had secret clearance jobs during WWII, including the women who worked at Bletchley Park, to say where they worked during the war, even to their husbands and fathers. No doubt that Act did not help the important men in their lives to recognize the talent and effort of the women, to change their view of the women. That seemed to indicate that the men and a male-dominated society somehow knew during the war that the women were smart, and recruited them to help win the war, but somehow the women became dumb after the war.

I know from history that this really happened so it's good of this show to point that out, peripherally. Even today, more than 60 years (2 generations) after WWII, there exists societies that actively suppress women, to 'do without' the benefit of their intellectual talents and efforts.

The costumes and makeup in the show certainly make that era seem grim. I am told that after the war in Britain, life indeed was grim. There were shortages of everything including food. I would have given this show 5 stars if it showed more instances of historically correct societal practices, as does another British TV program, Foyle's War.",1403827200,,1643,4.881720430107527

6132695,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"I found this series fascinating since there really was a Bletchley Circle or its counterpart.  These girls were ordinary girls raised in Great Britain who were probably volunteers and after extensive testing were found to be highly intelligent and possessing certain individual skills which could be applied to codes. They solve a particular code confounding the code-breakers and prevent the Nazis from triumphing in an unusual attack against the British planned within the month.  They reunite after the war to solve murders and other crimes, simply because they did not want to stand by and let these atrocities occur.  All four joined, applying their individual skills, and they solved murder cases, crimes of a particular repugnant nature, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed both seasons.  Well-acted, much suspense, and surprising resolutions, result.",1402444800,,848,5.5

6132712,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Bletchley Circle starts with a realistic scene during wartime at Bletchley.  The characters, and what they are going through personally as a result of playing a critical part in the wartime, and now not being able to talk about it, and having to return to the life of a housewife or librarian etc., seems very real.  Their natural and heightened abilities allow them to see things that the local constabulary cannot - and it speaks to the ""there, there..."" attitude that men had towards women in the mid 20th century.

The writing and production team, have done an excellent job of making some of the scenes very much ""thriller"" material, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Acting is excellent.  I hope this group keep going a very long time.",1401667200,,748,4.636363636363637

6132715,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,i found I fell in love with the 1st season and loved that the 2nd was 2 different mysteries. I find the ladies to be really interesting and I like that they are different ages. I find that WW2 is an interesting back drop for this series and the following 1950's,1401494400,,261,4.137254901960785

6132718,2,B00H4ZEFTQ,"I like several of the actors involved in this series but they could not save the writing. I enjoyed season one and therefore stupidly bought all the episodes in season two. Big mistake. While not bad, it was not at all compiling after the second episode. Unfortunately Anna Maxwell Martin departed the show and her loss is felt. The other characters are not bad but none are particularly memorable and I was never able to become invested in any of their stories. This show seems to be an attempt to cash in on the success of Sherlock and Call the Midwives but having a mystery to solve and being set in post-WWII England is sufficient. The stories needed to be more creative and the characters more interesting. If it's available on Prime, watch it, otherwise, find a better British show.",1401321600,3,788,4.635714285714286

6132720,4,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Season 2 is really two 90 minute episodes divided  into two parts each. The characters and acting really make the series.

6132722,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"This is another PBS winner! It is a suspense program with very accomplished actors. The program is interesting going back to the days of WW11. The ""spying"" on the enemy was efficient and the shows the feeling of patriotism that is associated with the War.

This series is superb and love the time period and subject - great to see intelligent women using their skills.  Look forward to more of ""The Bletchley Circle"" episodes.

6132728,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Enjoyed this second season of Bletchley Circle as much as the first.  Interesting group of women, all very smart, all under valued by themselves, by society and men.  But not undervalued by each other.  They expect a lot of each other, support each other, and know each other better than anyone else, including husbands.  The secrecy surrounding their work in the war and the amazing things they did only makes their current mundane lives more stifling.  There are no medals or titles for them, and only routine to look forward to.  But the crimes they solve make use of their skills, and help others.  The interactions of the one married women, and her conflictions are a good arc in the storyline.  All the characters are developing in their lives, but we won't know what might happen in their futures because BBC didn't renew the series.  Too bad.",1400803200,,850,4.727891156462585

It's wonderful seeing these accomplished women get together when one of their own is on trial for murder. It saddes me to lose Susan to another country halfway through the season. I do like the new member, however. You get to see these intelligent women face the back-to-the-kitchen mindset of the fifties.

Season Two treats us to two separate stories and introduces a new character who is every bit as compelling as the other Bletchley women.

I loved the continuation of the same crime through out the entire first season ,and the determination of the characters.  In the second season I  felt even the characters didn't want to be involved.

Did miss Susan in the second part, but understand her fears.  These ladies are great and so intuitive; did not find it slow like someone wrote.  It was just different plots and I like how they communicate and get the job done.  One can see how stupid the local police are and never get it.

The subject matter handled by Bletchley during WWII was vital, critical even, and I figured the stories would be more in line with that Bletchley history.  Instead, it seems to be simply working to relate to the Bletchley history by using the ladies who had been present there during the war.  The mysteries seem to be more interested in post-war  England, smuggling, human trafficking, etc.  My wife loves it, and I'm waiting to see if Bletchley 3 will improve or continue as it is going.  I really enjoyed the Foyle's War series because of the time setting and history.  Even after the war episodes, Foyle continues to deal with the same characters, now working on related issues.

These are so well written and acted during the few years after WWII and what the women were supposed to do after the war. The US had it's same let down of women in work after the war. But Britain was closer to the action earlier and it is good to have that part also at the beginning of the series.

A great drama about 5 women (or is it 6) trying to lead 'normal' lives as housewives and low-level employees (as were most women who rejoined the workforce or got married, post-war, in the 40's and 50's). Being highly intelligent and having worked for the government during WW II as government intelligence code-breakers, they learned to THINK, use their creative problem solving skills and successfully track enemy movements. Going back to life after the war, as if they were the same person as before the war, proves impossible. They find themselves voluntarily drawn to undercover crime solving, unraveling extremely hard-to-solve crimes without the approval or support of the police. Good personal stories & good character drawings of each woman. Great stories of saving the day with a little human compassion thrown in.",1400025600,,840,5.276119402985074

6132765,4,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Series 2 of ""The Bletchley Circle"" picks up in 1953 the story of four women who worked together at Bletchley Park HQ during World War II. Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin) is shaken by her last adventure and reluctant to get involved in any more crime-solving, her anxiety compounded by her inability to explain her fears and frustrations to husband Timothy (Mark Dexter). Flamboyant Millie (Rachel Stirling) is putting her linguistic talents to use as a German translator. Lucy (Sophie Rundle) is now a clerical support officer at Scotland Yard. Jean, researcher and a kind of den mother to the younger women, still works as a librarian. The series has a new production designer but retains its even, muted lighting and brown tones that enhance the ""period"" look. Guy Burt has written two mysteries in four hour-long episodes this season. The mysteries are better than the hackneyed deviant serial killer of Series 1, though the characters suffer a little. The episodes are:

In ""Blood on Their Hands"", Jean is disturbed to learn that a woman who worked under her at Bletchley Park, Alice Merren (Hattie Morahan), has been convicted of the murder of another former colleague, biologist John Richards (Paul McGann). Jean visits Alice in prison and comes away suspicious that Alice hasn't told what she knows about Richards' death and is protecting someone by refusing to defend herself in court. Jean enlists Lucy and Millie's help in investigating the murder case, which leads them to the apartment of 17-year-old Lizzie Lancaster (Faye Marsay), where they find some classified documents that Lancaster claims never to have seen before. Meanwhile, Susan's husband has gotten a promotion that may entail a 2-year posting abroad. Jean needs her help, but Susan feels she cannot get involved in an investigation that may place her family in danger. This is an interesting mystery, though Susan's character seems strained and a bit distasteful.

""Uncustomed Goods"" sees Alice Merren trying to find work in spite of her notoriety. Millie has lost her job and is selling black market perfumes and stockings to make ends meet. Business takes a scary turn, however, when Millie is abducted by Maltese gangsters and detained until her boss in the black market goods business, Jasper (Rob Jarvis), comes up with the money that he owes his supplier, a criminal matriarch named Marta (Brana Bajic). Millie is further disturbed to learn that this crime family is in the white slavery business, luring young women from behind the Iron Curtain to come to Great Britain with promises of jobs as chambermaids, then selling the women as sex slaves to various hoteliers. Millie feels it is her responsibility to ensure that the crime ring is busted and the women freed. Millie seems uncharacteristically emotional, and the ruse she carries out with Jean strains credibility. The mystery plays into the current British moral panic over ""trafficking"".",1399680000,2,2925,5.104384133611691
6132766,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"The Bletchley Circle, Season 2, is a great PBS series. I chose the rating, because it is an exceptionally well done show.

6132769,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"The cast is outstanding and the stories seem to fit the cast hand in glove.  I love period pieces and this one excels.  I wasn't sure if the continuation could be as good as the first season, but they are.  My only real disappointment is that Anna Maxwell Martin (who some might remember as an outstanding Esther Summerson in the recent BBC Bleak House) is only in the first of the two episodes in this set.  Her querkiness and her laser like powers of deduction bring Sherlock to mind.  The cast feed off each other so well; nothing seems forced.

The production values continue to be of highest quality.  So much attention to detail in presenting the 1950's look and feel that it is easy to get lost in that time.  All in all, if you love good storytelling, quality acting and beautiful sets and scenery, then this is a must buy.

6132772,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Good acting. Clever writing. Well directed. But best of all, the story is about women who want to be taken seriously in the early 50s.

6132778,4,B00H4ZEFTQ,"'The Bletchley Circle' returns for it's second year. I really admired this group of women in their first year. Each of them very intelligent, great insight and able to see through any clue in minute detail. They had all worked at a secret installation, Bletchley Park, during World War 2. These mysteries take place in the early '50s after WWII, and this new season gives us some years after the first season ended.

The Bletchley Circle shows us  the frustrations and issues women faced in their workplace with the sexism and limits placed on them. Their talent was based on how fast they could type and what they looked like in a tight skirt. They have become mothers, secretaries and librarians. And, in their off time they solve mysteries and often murders.

This is a four-episode season, with two episodes related to each other.  Susan, played by Anna Maxwell Martin, remains traumatized after a close encounter in the first season with a murderer. She takes part in the first two episodes, and then leaves with her family for a foreign posting. We follow the women as they try to prove the innocence of a former colleague. Rachel Stirling plays Millie the most adventurous and beautiful of the group. She shines in the third and fourth episodes as the ladies try to solve the puzzle of strange codes and young girls for sale.

I enjoyed this series,but at times it seems as if the writers are stretching. Give them their own detective bureau, and let them really shine.

6132797,2,B00H4ZEFTQ,"I think it lack the thrilling and excitement of the first series.  It  also seemed to run a lot shorter than the first one. Perhaps if they do a third one it will be much better. I am not sure however, if the all of the original cast memebers will return. One of the main character moved away with her family.  I had to pay to watch it. I would have preferred to have watched it for free on PBS.",1398902400,,395,3.9125
6132798,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"I'm sad that the series won't be renewed because not only  is it excellent and original but features something almost unprecedented in our culture--brainiac women who worked as code breakers at Bletchley Park during the war and who remain firmly on the side of right despite of the male opposition to their independence.

This time around Jean rallies the others to resolve the case of a former colleague who is going to be hung for murder since she has refused to speak in her own defense. The case involves cold war intrigue, biological warfare and a mind gone terribly wrong.

The second story which sees Susan being replaced by Alice revolves about a murderous black market ring.

The sets, costuming, characterizations and acting are marvelous. I hope the BBC reconsiders and commissions more episodes.",1398902400,,807,5.0
6132799,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Can't wait to see the next episodes, the series is gutsy, and compelling. In addition, it's very interesting to see the period dress, furniture, cars, and the like. The camera lighting is really superb, and adds so much to the feel of the plot.

6132800,3,B00H4ZEFTQ,"This season was only ok in my eyes, the story was sort of fragmented and not quite as gripping as the first season.  I think, if they come out with a third season I will probably buy it but I will buy it used for a lesser price because this one was certainly not worth what I paid for it.",1398902400,,288,3.8
6132801,3,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Bletchley Circle is better than a lot of broadcast & cable presentations. It's interesting, engaging, well acted & presented, and. as a bonus, dramatizes a story premise (women's important role in Britain's secret WW2 ENIGMA code breaking effort & the subsequent suppression of that role in a drive to return to ""normalcy"") which is little known, under-reported & mostly under-appreciated. It's a story that should be told (& heard), & it is - by a committed, well qualified & capable cast & crew.
That being said, Season 2, Episode 1 is not as strong as the first season. The acting & setting are still good, but the specific premise (a seeming government cover-up of a secret bio-weapon program 'mishap') while plausible seems extreme, & the ultimate denouement seems unrealistic bordering on fantastical.

[Note (to the producers or whomever): There would seem to be a similar storyline about the similar contributions & experiences of key women scientists & technical support staff who aided the (also secret) US WW2 Manhattan Project.

6132811,3,B00H4ZEFTQ,"The first season promised a different type of mystery with the former codebreakers using their skills to solve a series of murders.  Though interesting at first it soon degenerated from an intellectual exercise into a melodramatic murder mystery.

The second season basically continued this emphasis on a standard murder mystery and ended up being no different from Foyle's War except that it involves four women after World War II whereas Foyle's War involved Foyle and his driver during World War II.

Nevertheless, the second season somewhat redeemed itself in the fourth and last episode by reverting back to codebreaking.  The girls needed a German Enigma code machine to decode encrypted messages used by a villain who had once apparently worked for British intelligence.  It seems that these codebreaking skills are essentially limited to actual codebreaking but I thought the best idea came from the first episode of season one when the girls used these skills to analyze the train travel habits of a serial killer.

This second season has also toned down the political correctness.  It spends less time attacking men and the police.  It also goes so far as to make the villains in the second part an ethnic minority, a criminal gang from Malta (including a wartime British intelligence recruit).  It even presents its first female villain as the woman who runs the criminal enterprise.  While the chances of a woman running a Maltese criminal gang in the early 1950s must be zero, it is a step forward.

One of the most interesting parts of this series is that it portrays the early 1950s in Britain.  But I remember the 1950s and there were no women with the hair style and tight-fitting dresses that Millie wears.  If there were we would have had no reason to move on from that era.  Nevertheless it is a good period piece.",1398643200,2,1834,4.874193548387097

As someone else said, it was lackluster and seemed forced.  I was especially disappointed with not only the change in the Susan character, but that she was written out of the series completely.

It' was a wonderful season 1 but maybe that should have been the movie and then it's done.  I found myself  falling asleep before one part had ended.  The parts are drawn too far out and boring.

If you like British whodunits, only this time with five brilliant women, then this is the show for you.",1398211200,,518,4.138613861386139

Your Marketing Department is doing their best to sell us DVDs.  However, I believe the immediate future is streaming content and very seldom will we be purchasing DVDs anymore.  So - we'll be watching for programming that you can stream to us.

And looking forward to that!!

6132838,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,The two separate stories in this Season 2 are excellent and superbly acted I love how the actual mystery does not overshadow the character development and detailed social history in this drama. I hope they will be making more stories for the women of Bletchley. What a refreshing series!,1398038400,,287,4.877551020408164

The stories are solved in such a unique way.
These women obviously played very important roles in the ww2  using their gifts of seeing patterns and ability to decode situations.

I thought Season 1 was perfect but didn't like losing Susan in this Season. Well, no matter, the series is done. Too bad ITV doesn't think a show about four whip smart females is worth keeping.",1397692800,8,349,4.384615384615385

6132847,2,B00H4ZEFTQ,I love the first season but this new one is a little lackluster. Hate that they made millie so stupid. I couldn't stay interested. The plot  for the second season has been used about a hundred times and felt forced. I can understand susan's lack of enthusiasm for it all. I did really like the commentary from some of the actual codecrackers from the real bletchley circle afterward. The one lady with the intense eyes reminded of susan personality WISE.,1397520000,5,454,4.675

Which meant, in that time, to lower their standards and become ordinary women.  However, these four just can't do it! They have to use their minds to continue to solve problems.  And we are the fortunate ones that get to see them use their well honed skills to do so.

I admire these ladies so much.",1397433600,2,473,4.453488372093023

6132850,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"First off, it you have not already seen Season 1, I recommend that you do as you'll learn the background on the characters. (You can find my review on Amazon.) With that said, I will proceed with my review of this wonderful ""series"" but I should also point out that this is a review of the DVD version (from PBS home Video - which they sent to me) which includes bonus features. Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL review of all formats of a show (broadcast, streaming and DVD and BD). You should always sort reviews by ""newest first"" and then look at format the reviewer is commenting on.

A bit of background on what is here. Unlike US TV series which go on for at least 13 episodes, British TV series can be much shorter. The first season of The Bletchley Circle (TBC) was a three part story running 135 minutes. This ""Season Two"" DVD contains two independent ""stories"" (each divided into two 45 minute ""episiodes""). The show was created, and aired, in the UK on the commercial ITV network (not the non-commercial BBC) and later aired on PBS in the US. To my knowledge these are the ITV originals. I did not see the US-PBS broadcast version but they are usually edited for some graphic images of violence.

I do not believe in ""spoilers"" and you won't find any here. Just some basic info: Season One took place in 1951 or 1952 after giving us scenes from their 1940s war years.  This season bring the characters - a group of female ""code breakers"" who were based in Bletchley, England during World War II - up to 1953 when they are now in civilian lives during the Cold War. (There is a brief sojourn back to 1943 at the beginning to set up the story - but I can't say much more about that either. In each of the two stories this time, one of the women is a victim of a crime and the others band together to solve it.

The script is written by a male but nearly all the actors (and the directors - there are two) are female.

The DVD has one bonus feature and it's well done. It's a 27 minute featurette featuring interviews with all the cast and production crew (with a few clips from the show, but - thankfully - not many). It is bookended with a  new interview with one of the actual Bletchley Project members. And for those following the series, the interview with the director of the second story on this DVD, will bring some real surprises (I said NO ""spoilers"" from me, remember?).
From what I can tell, there will be a third season though, as I noted above, the two stories in Season Two each can stand on their own with no ""cliffhangers:.

Another fine British TV ""mystery"" drama.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6132851,5,B00H4ZEFTQ,"Another hit from BBC!  I expected not to like this but I love it.  Just like with ""Doc Martin"", it was a very pleasant surprise.",1395964800,,128,4.08
6132852,4,B00H4ZEFTQ,"During the Second World War, Bletchley Park was the headquarters of the UK's decryption organization, where various codes and cyphers were translated by a staff that was made up of 80% women. When the war came to a close they went back to ordinary life, keeping their activities during the war a secret even from their closest family members. They were extraordinary women, who not only saved lives with their diligence but were some of the world's first computer programmers.

Although ""The Bletchley Circle"" (rather sadly) takes place well after the war has come to a close, the protagonists are all former-Bletchley members who use their puzzle-solving skills to ferret out answers to various mysteries. In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-first-series/dp/B00BCXW106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the first series</a>&nbsp;Susan Grey, a wife and mother, was feeling stifled by her current life-style and eager to recapture what she considered the glory years by catching a serial killer. Alongside her former comrades (outspoken Millie, quiet Lucy, no-nonsense Jean) they managed to hunt him down, though not without a significant psychological toll.

As with the first series, the second begins with a brief prologue that takes place in the midst of the war before moving forward ten years. Another of their old colleges is in serious trouble - having been found guilty of murdering her former lover, Alice Merren now faces execution for his murder. Having gone to see her in prison, Jean is certain that she's not only innocent, but also hiding something - but what on earth would you keep secret when you're about to be hanged?

This time it's Jean who rounds up the old crew, finding it easy enough to bring Lucy and Millie on board, but discovering that after her traumatic experience in series one, Susan wants nothing to do with the investigation, especially when she thinks it'll threaten her own family.

Unlike the last series, which dealt with the fairly straightforward hunt for a serial killer, series two has the women embroiled in espionage, where military secrets and government cover-ups form the basis of the first two episodes. The final two involve Millie getting into trouble over her under-the-table business dealings. She ends up kidnapped as a result, leaving Alice, Jean and Lucy to track her down before all four women try to bring down the cartel that's profiteering off stolen goods and young prostitutes.

On that note, the format of series two is a little different: whereas the first series was a straightforward three-part miniseries, this has two storylines divided over the course of four episodes. Furthermore, the last two episodes do not involve Susan, with the focus shifting to Millie and Alice instead.

Along with the attention to detail in visualizing the 1950s (the fashions, the cars, the lingo), I hugely appreciated the emphasis that's put on paperwork. These women don't have access to computers or databases; if they want information they have to sit down and trawl through endless files in order to get it. There's a real sense of the intelligence and patience of these women, traits that would have served them well during the war years.

Personally I was not quite as riveted by the second series as I was by the first, but ""The Bletchley Circle"" continues to be a unique crime-drama starring compelling and sympathetic female characters. Definitely recommended.",1395014400,61,3459,5.266787658802178
