1031537,3,6305470499,"Although it has some funny scenes and a great idea behind it, this movie just didn't seem to take off for me.  Woody Allen has done much better in the past.  Even his ""Deconstructing Harry"" was better than this.  It was just too uneventful.  I do agree that Leo DiCaprio had one of the  best scense in the movie.  It does show that the man can act, when given  the right oppurtunity.  (Although it is debatable if his small, almost  un-important part was deserved of an Oscar nomination as a few reviewers  have commented.)  Kenneth Brannah's character was funny, but I think that  actors playing the lead in Woody Allen comedies need to stop pretending  they're Woody.  Although I've only seen two do it, Brannah and John Cusack,  I have no doubt others have as well (or will.  I really hope Sean Penn  doesn't try it out in this next movie!). I also wish Woody would stop  giving the very talented Judy Davis such insecure, neurotic roles. I think  I've seen her in three of his movies, and she seems to be the same in each.  She is a beautiful and talented actress, and I think Woody should let her  show it more (although I haven't seen her Oscar nominated performance in  Husbands and Wives, so maybe he has at least once). Like I said, if you're  a Woody fan, you might go for this.  If not, don't expect a great movie.  Get some of his classics instead.",937267200,3,1360,4.387096774193548
1031538,4,6305470499,"First, let me explain my one line review. I've seen people's comments on this movie, stating he was way off on the way the average citizen views celebrities, and the way they act. These people must get their impressions  of celebrities entirely from the self serving fanzines and official studio  web sites. Who are you going to believe concerning the inner workings of  the world of fame? A long time director, who has pehaps daily contact with  the Hollywood ""elite"", or people who work 9 to 5 jobs and have no  closer contact with celebrities than ""People"" magazine?  Anyway. The movie was brilliant and powerful, especially the ending. I  thought the humor was wonderfully hysterical. I found myself rolling with  laughter, as I do with the humorous moments in all his films. Especially  powerful and provocative were the scenes between Kenneth Branagh and Winona  Ryder. I have known women like her character, hopelessly messed up and self  destructive, destroying people in their path, yet you can't seem to help  trying to save them from themselves, and falling in love with them.  One sore point. I found Mr. Branagh's Wooody imitation annoying and  pointless. I am not bothered by Woody's speaking style or mannerisms, but  that's him. They are a part of who he is. On anyone else they are  effectatious window dressing. Kenneth Branagh should have played it  straight. I would have enjoyed his performance much more, and I feel it  would have turned what I feel to be a four star film into a five star one.",935798400,,1516,4.810077519379845
1031539,3,6305470499,"i have and always will enjoy woody allen's use of beautiful black and white.  however, many of us have spent thousands of dollars on surround sound equipment for our home entertainment centers.  why bother releasing a  film on d.v.d. if it is going to be recorded in mono?

1031658,5,6305470499,"I gave this five stars because I was glued to it. I found it so funny, ironic, and true of the human condition, of contemporary urban intellectual sophisticates, a group to which all of us who watched the film probably belong. I found the mirror held up by Woody and the fine cast an accurate portrait of our daily/lifelong neurotic struggles.

I frankly enjoyed all of the actors performances ( including diCaprio's, who plays a character just like the one he plays later in ""Revolutionary Road.""), and I find Woody Allen films very inspiring, as in true to life. I guess it makes a lot of people nervous or uncomfortable, judging from the comments here, to see how neurotic and narcissistic we all are, but we are, including DiCaprio's character! In that sense, this film is very realistic, more realistic say, than the average action-thriller-spy-police-chase film, or the average ""funny"" romantic comedy.

Anyway, I loved it, and thanks to those reviewers who urge us to see it again. I will!",1420329600,,996,4.852941176470588

1031661,5,6305470499,"i liked this movie lots, lots more seeing it again in 2013 than on my first viewing when it was released. everyone' s trying to have a relationship while being enmeshed in celebrity or lingering on its periphery. (present day there has also been the release of coppola's THE BLING RING about how some kids want to be famous for being famous like Paris Hilton but steal from these celebs to meet this goal!)  so woody allen was ahead of his time in realizing that we were becoming progressively more celebrity crazed well before THE BLING RING.

our guide through the celebrity circles of New York City is a stand in for the usual woody allen role as played by Kenneth Branagh. he is the best actor Woody Allen ever found to play himself. if he looked anything like him, he could be his twin he gets him down so thoroughly.

the branagh character divorces the Judy Davis character who has to redo her whole life which throws the two of them into constant contact with celebs. hers is not intentional while he will do ANYTHING to meet them and get them to include them in their world.  kenneth tries to connect with everyone from Charlize Theron to Melanie Griffith to Leonardo DiCaprio.  the latter is the funniest as he goes completely over the top on spoofing himself as an out of control star.  this starts with trashing his hotel rooms, to foursomes, to domestic violence flareups.  he is hilarious and kenneth with him is even more so.

the judy davis character actually has a fairly satisfying romance with joe mantegna.  her scenes are funny in a different way from kenneth's but equally as good.  they are both powerhouse actors.

all in all i think this film holds up really well.

1031662,2,6305470499,"If you are a committed Woody Allen fan and determined to have a complete collection I suppose that is adequate excuse to buy Celebrity. If you are seeking complete collections of Kenneth Branagh or Judy Davis movies or movies by any number of the actors who appear, walk on or cameo in this movie then you have an excuse to buy Celebrity. If you're looking for an evening's entertainment do not read further, do not get this movie, do not rent this movie. It's just not worth it.

Kenneth Branagh is a brilliant actor and more than capable director. One can almost see him eager to be an actor in a movie written and directed by Woody Allen. No doubt some of the other stars were looking for some Woody Allen magic and perhaps a chance to appear in a movie with each other. Speaking as a Woody Allen fan I can't think of any reason to condemn a general viewing audience to a showing of this movie.

Somehow we're supposed to believe that Kenneth Branagh playing another one of the neurotic New York stuttering fumbling male comedic characters is a former star high school athlete recently divorced from another neurotic New York female Judy Davis/Annie Hall retread. About one third of this movie consists of these two characters being neurotic and inhibited and recently divorced from each other. The ex-husband Lee Simon is of course incompetent on a heroic scale and we are told is simply unlucky in love. The ex-wife Robin Simon goes almost directly from the marriage bed into the arms of a man who will not only loves her idiosyncrasies but turns them into what we are led to believe will be a successful television career.

What saves this movie from a single star rating is that between being aggravated by an otherwise nothing new central plot device is a parade of clever to superior acting performances from people like Melanie Griffith, Winona Ryder, Leonardo DiCaprio and Babe Neuwirth.

There is some yammering about a culture that's lost its values and people who are famous for being famous and so on. There is no new ground being broken here. Ultimately we have two caricatures we have seen too many times from Woody Allen. They've lost their charm and here they are quite aggravating. This is a movie with a few comedic moments some pretense of philosophy and I don't know a partridge in a pear tree or something. Other than its value to collectors I can not imagine who the intended audience might be. I cannot recommend this movie.",1375056000,,2450,4.651270207852194
1031663,5,6305470499,"Sir Kenneth Branagh!

Wow! I forgot he's from Ireland! What a terrific performance!

The Best Woody Allen performance by a female lead goes to Judy in this movie.

I had avoided Woody Allen films after the Mia fiasco but I'm back on his team and playing catch-up to all his films. This one is from 1998 and you get to remember how pretty Leonardo De Caprio was in his youth.

I like the story. It is a grown up movie for grown ups. It it better than anything playing right now at the big Cinemas (except for Lincoln and Argo).

You can read what the movie is about on other websites or comments. I'm just going to tell you it is a very good movie that you will watch more than once. So save your $12 new movie ticket and buy a used copy of this movie on Amazon.

My favorite Woody Allen movie is Midnight in Paris, even though the lead actor did an annoying impersonation of Woody Allen. Sir Kenneth Branagh owns this role and then you'll sort of remember he has stirred in a bit of Woody in his acting.

1031667,4,6305470499,"I had read some reviews of Celebrity which were less then flattering so purchased this not sure what to expect. However my love of Woody Allen movies overcame my concerns. I think this film is way better than I had been lead to believe. The exposing of the inherent stupidity in the fascination so many people have with ""celebrities"", despite the feet of clay those ""celebrities"" exhibit, is really well developed and maintained and the sad failure of the principal character is beautifully realised. In this part Kenneth Branagh out Woodies Woody. Maybe he isn't quite as whiny as Woody Allen himself, but he is truly a great substitute Woody. Leonardo Di Caprio gives a priceless cameo performance as a foul mouthed and violent star who emerges from displaying his rottenness to the adulation of his adoring fans. Very telling. All of the players in this film are excellent and Winona Rider astounded me with how good she was as a less than loveable girl. I like Celebrity a lot and recommend it to you.",1336003200,3,1005,4.748571428571428
1031768,3,6305470499,"I can't decide if Celebrity is just sloppy or if Woody Allen was finally getting more comfortable with himself.  This film has some of the same themes we have seen before:
the lack of interest in fidelity
fugitive emotions
wanting what ever it is that you can't have
bad food and such small portions
a lovely moment that goes horribly wrong
Judy Davis getting hysterical

But this time we see everything without the layer of charm we have been trained to expect from WAFPs.

I can't help wondering if the film would have gone better if Joe Mantegna had played the nebbishy husband and Kenneth Branagh played the studio exec.

The film fails in that by the end, we are ready to say goodbye and we don't care what happens to the only copy of the novel. Didn't they have computers when this film was made?",1298246400,,802,4.472602739726027

1031772,5,6305470499,"This wry and devastating portrait of the cult of celebrityhood is one of Allen's most brilliant--and entertaining--films.  It isn't Allen's first effort at deconstructing celebrityhood.  ""Stardust Memories"" was.  But ""Celebrity"" goes way beyond ""Stardust"" in both depth and self-criticism.  For it must be recognized that the chief celebrity at whom Allen is poking fun is himself.

Kenneth Branagh's performance as the ersatz Woody Allen is simply stunning.  He's captured Allen's nebbish persona so well that he almost begins to physically resemble Allen by the film's end.  Some critics found the uncanny mimicry irritating, but to do so is to miss the whole point.  Allen wants to show that there's a flimsiness to celebrityhood, a shallowness that all of the celebrities in the film exhibit to one degree of another.  Having Branagh ""play"" Woody Allen is just a metaphor for the smoke and mirror nature of celebrityhood.  It's all surface, and roles are interchangeable.  Identity or personal substance isn't what matters.  Getting into the spotlight for the requisite 15 minutes of fame is all that counts.

Performances in the film are especially good.  It's as if the actors, knowing full well how flimsy celebrityhood is, really relished the opportunity to make the point on screen.  Charlize Theron, Leonardo diCaprio, Winona Ryder, and Famke Janssen are fabulous.  Judy Davis is less so, having perhaps played the woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown once too often.  Joe Mantegna is superb as the only person in the film not obsessed (and ruined) by the lust for celebrity.

Finally, Woody takes aim at audiences--just as he did in ""Stardust Memories""--who perpetuate celebrityhood by demanding that stars be larger than life and who wind up focusing on them rather than art.  This gentle chiding on his part, if nothing else, makes ""Celebrity"" well worth seeing.",1226880000,2,1879,5.1827242524916945
1031773,5,6305470499,"""Celebrity"" is one of Woody's best, and most under appreciated and also unjustly attacked films. The production is first rate, the characters diverse, and the acting -- from Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Melanie Griffith, Joe Mantegna -- as good as in any Allen film. It is a wonderful and highly observant film, that seems to offend many for reasons that no one seems able to really express, other than by resorting to vituperative adjectives and hand wringing.

As far as I can tell, it offends some people because it is thought to be ""more of the same"" late ""Manhattan"" period Allen ensemble work -- pity Mozart if he had been cranking out symphonies for these complainers; it is thought to be annoying because Kenneth Branagh does what is, really, a wonderful Allen impression, Woody being too old by the time was made to play the lead in the story; because the characters are more fully developed, and so perhaps more subtle and less immediately amusing, versions of the classic Allen character types that, by the time the film was made, had become well known to audiences impatient for novelty and new amusements from Allen; because, perhaps, many solid middle American types have such an instinctive and deep seated hatred for the particular New York types that populate Allen films that this film evidently pushed the buttons of those audience members to extremes that mandated vicious opining in revenge; and, perhaps, last but not least, because Allen films tend to attract either comedy lovers who are put off by misanthropic elements, or misanthropes who are put off by overly human and flawed characters that don't live up to their notions of worthiness, or which make light of misanthropic virtues.

There's a reason Woody made Stardust Memories, also one of his finest films. The raging disappointment expressed by some toward his more challenging films, and to some of his more phoned in and forgettable ones, points to the creative conflict, and conflicted audience reactions, highlighted in Stardust Memories. All that aside, ""Celebrity"" is a marvelous film, that surely deserves a better DVD transfer than it receives here. Hopefully, when the entire Allen catalog is given a much needed 16:9 remastering someday, ""Celebrity"" will re-emerge and be appreciated by new audiences.",1218240000,6,2314,5.086842105263158
1031774,3,6305470499,"The Chinese have their years named after various animals. Apparently this year for me is the Year of Woody Allen. For the better part of the year I have been watching, and in several cases re- watching films, that the comic has acted in, produced, directed or some combination of the three. Some have been disappointing.  Some, like Annie Hall, have withstood the test of time and go into the pantheon. Others, reflecting the fact that if one lives long enough, as Allen has, then one is sure to repeat themes worked in the past, sometimes with uneven results. That is the case with Celebrity. There are some very funny individual scenes that rank with Allen classics but overall we have been here before. Allen's look at the pranks and pitfalls of celebrity in New York City (his favorite locale, and correctly so) in the mid-1990's is the updated version of his less than funny Zelig that looked at celebrity in the Jazz Age.

Moreover, the film has an overly manic quality, particularly on the part of the frustrated male writer (surprise, surprise) and his unfulfilled and bewildered schoolteacher wife soon to be separated so that said writer can `find' himself. The mannerisms (to speak nothing of a certain vague similarity of appearance) of the pair reminded me of the good old days when Woody and Mia (oops, better not mention that) held forth.

Unfortunately, he wasn't persuasive enough as Branagh's performance was more a caricature of Woody than anything else. As for Judy Davis, who I like in practically everything, she is misused. Her personality is more exaggeration than person. It seems to me that Allen cleaved off various neuroses from his own personality, and then evenly distributed them to the male and female leads. There's just not a whole lot of depth to this film. It fails to teach us anything that is not blatantly obvious, but it certainly was entertaining.

He only thinks he knows what makes his partner tick, and he's too busy telling her to listen to her perspective.

1031850,4,6305470499,"Ah! Fame...a circus where everybody wants a number...Who's not fascinated by it?

Talented director Woody Allen examines this phenomenon in a terrific movie called Celebrity.  Kenneth Branagh stars as Lee Simons, a writer who's looking for support for his script and is interviewing famous stars. While he goes deep down the world of movie stars, supermodels and big celebrities, Lee ends up his marriage with Robin, who at first doesn't take well the breakup but soon gets involved with a charismatic man that changes her life an vision about the future.

A sharp comedy that exposes the silly reasons of why people become famous and the even more ridiculous behavior they exhibit, Celebrity is brilliantly acted, flawlessly written and filmed in shiny black and white.

Once again, critics and fans of Allen's work won't be able but to find similarities with his life. Lee is a typical Woody, in a marriage crisis, hyperkinetic, black humored, sex-obsessed, and talking constantly about human relationships and his multiple neurosis.

The representation of what could be his life becomes in Celebrity in hard criticism, even harder than the one showed in Deconstructing Harry. Is the voice of a tormented man, able to question his life trough his art.

The interesting thing about Celebrity is that present us Lee as a confident, arrogant, happy man living the life he always wanted. And who can blame him for that? But gradually, the layers of that happiness fall out until we get a character shaking, naked hearing the cold voices of his personal demons.

1031854,2,6305470499,"** 1/2 stars rating for this movie. ""Celebrity"" features most of Woody Allen's trademarks: a huge number of characters, a lot of cameos, a lot of mini-stories that are connected between each other, and dialogues filled of whining, sexual allusions, irony and social satire. When the movie is well made, like ""Hannah And Her Sisters"", ""Annie Hall"" or ""Manhattan"", those Woody Allen's trademarks translate into a very good movie, with lots of fun and entertainment. But when is made like ""Celebrity"" the final result is a failure of a movie.

 THE BEST: Without a doubt, Charlize Theron, Winona Ryder, Famke Janssen and Melanie Griffith are the best of the movie, all of them are beautiful women and make their scenes in ""Celebrity"" more interesting than they would have been without those gorgeous actresses.

 Some of the dialogues in the Leonardo DiCaprio segments are funny and original. There are a lot of interesting cameos. The black & white photography gives personality to the film, in an era packed of explosions and computer generated special effects, is always interesting to see a black & white movie.

 THE WORST: Without a doubt, the worst in the movie is the Kenneth Branagh character, he is a great actor, but in this movie he makes an increasingly irritating Woody Allen imitation. When the real Woody Allen is the central character, his voice, attitude and physic translate into a funny character, but when someone else does a cheap imitation, the central character becomes pathetic. A lot of the scenes and situations are very, very boring and pointless.

1031855,4,6305470499,"Despite the title and the parade of characters who can be labeled as such, Woody Allen's 1998 film ""Celebrity"" is, like most of his films, about the peculiar ability of a man to destroy the important interpersonal relationships in his life.  What makes ""Celebrity"" different is that this time around the Woody Allen part is not played by Allen, but by Kenneth Branagh.  The actor, who has been nominated for an Oscar for playing Shakespeare on the silver screen, decides to play the Woody Allen character in ""Celebrity"" just like Woody Allen.  Really.  The dialogue is all written in Allen's distinctive voice, but instead of it being said by a small, wiry, balding Jewish comedian it is being said by a large, robust, wavy-haired Irish actor with the EXACT same cadences and inflections.  Chances are that by the end of this film you still will not believe your ears on this one.
Now back to the film.
This time around the self-destructive main character is named Lee Simon (Branagh), a journalist and would be writer of a novel or screenplay if he can just get it done.  Having cast aside his wife Robin (Judy Davis), Simon goes looking for love with most of the women who cross his path, from a movie star (Melanie Griffith) and a supermodel (a sizzling Charlize Theron) to an actress who plays bit parts (Wynona Ryder).  Like Allen's script for this film, Lee's life is going around in circles.  He cannot articulate to Robin the reason why he is leaving her any more than he can fully explain any of his actions as he moves from one woman to the next.  As we are told at both the beginning and the end of the film, Lee Simon is a man who needs help.  The punch line to the cosmic joke is that after Lee's departure plunges her into the depths of despair, Robin's life moves onward and upward because realizing there are gaps in her life she tries to fill them and improve herself, even if it means turning to the experience Nina (Bebe Neuwrith) for some interesting life lessons.  By the end of the film she Robin is on top of her game and Lee is back where he started, and we realize this is something we have seen from Allen before and seen done better as well.
So, why did Allen simply not play himself?  Because Woody Allen looks like Woody Allen.  Today he looks more like an older Woody Allen (see ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"").  To put it bluntly, no supermodel is going to be interested in him.  Thus we have the transposition of the Allen persona into the body of Branagh, who brings a manliness to the comic's neurotic mannerisms.  When Branagh drives an antique Austin-Martin as a way of helping him pick up chicks, it sends a different signal than if it were Allen behind the wheel of that same car (besides, we know from ""Annie Hall"" that Woody can't drive).  The choice of Branagh and his decision to play the part this way has a significance that extends beyond the idea that it is just some sort of a joke.  There are two many sex scenes in this film for Allen to carried them off seriously.  More importantly, if the nebbish that Allen has created over four decades of film can look like Branagh, then that is certainly something for us to think about.",1053475200,4,3178,4.476603119584055
1031856,3,6305470499,"Andy Warhol once intoned that we'd all be famous for 15 minutes. In Woody Allen's 1998 comedy ""Celebrity,"" one of his characters cites that quotable quote. The unquenchable thirst for being applauded and lauded permeates this film. All of the denizens of this black-and-white NYC world gravitate toward photographers' flashbulbs, gossip column newsprint, and sound bites on entertainment TV. His cast of actresses, models, painters, writers, and producers are all jockeying to be recognizable to the public, as opposed to being recognized in their fields. It doesn't matter whether they create works of art or produce oeuvres that will be their permanent legacies--they all simply want a chance to appear on Page Six or be dished by Joan Rivers on the red carpet. (Allen shows this brilliantly during a second-rate movie premiere sequence, where Karen Duffy interviews arriving celebrities in a high-pitched, frenzied, continually growing fervor. Her hard-hitting questions of these minor celebs include insights into the weather, the rain, and the puddles. Additionally, Debra Messing makes a brief pre ""Will and Grace"" appearance as a bellowing banshee TV reporter. Her broadcasting is of a feverish, shouting, ear-splitting level.)
Allen, who at one time had been hailed as a comic genius, began to make serious, European-inspired films in the early 1980s. He is at his best, however, when he makes ""warmedys"" or ""dramedys,"" movies that walk the tightrope of laughing out loud and meditatively exploring affairs of the heart and mind. In Allen's personal life, which always included the requisite relationship with leading ladies (Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow), he seemed to be following what is mandated of directorial types. His reputation took a violent turn downward with his secret wooing and seducing of Soon-Yi, Farrow's adopted daughter. With his callow explanation of ""The heart wants what the heart wants,"" Allen had unwittingly joined a pantheon of fellow May-December offenders: Roman Polanski, Charlie Chaplin, Errol Flynn. It doesn't matter whether Soon-Yi was of legal age when the romance began, Allen was branded as a child grabber.
This fall from grace and the unwilling attainment of fame on a whole different level is the driving force of ""Celebrity."" Throughout the film, shallow models, spoiled actresses, high-strung editors, generous producers, and confused writers interact before backdrops of ""The Ricki Lake Show"" or ""Jerry Springer."" Look carefully and you'll see Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuco playing on a televison screen, and you'll catch Donald ""the Donald"" Trump extolling how he plans on buying up St. Patrick's Cathedral to raze it and build some dynamite condo space.
We live in a world where people become PEOPLE magazine cover stories by virtue of being kidnapped, taken hostage, or victimized in some grotesque way. We lionize interns who have achieved notoriety because of their oral skills, rather than their clerical talents. (Just the other day, a 60-plus-year-old woman has come out of the woodwork confessing to being the first First Intern, having taken advantage of executive privilege with JFK.)
Allen's movie delves into the whole culture of making a name for oneself without being able to name what one actually does. Kenneth Branagh, doing a dead-on Woody Allen impression, is a travel writer who has a midlife crisis that dictates he wants, and deserves, more than an occasional byline and tryst in bed with his long-suffering Catholic wife. Judy Davis is the aforementioned spouse, and she does a serviceable job as a woman who is convinced that she doesn't deserve happiness and any morsel of good fortune.
Along the way, the two characters separate and divorce, then become involved with lunatics and lovers played by Charlize Theron, Famke Janssen, Winona Ryder, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Joe Mantegna. Interestingly, Theron (as a self-absorbed, selfish woman who basically has become famous for wearing lingerie on a runway) utters a prior Allen line: She admits to being polymorphously perverse, being able to attain pleasure wherever she's touched. Allen uses that same adjective to describe the Keaton character in ""Annie Hall."" (And he uses its reverse, ""polymorphously insensitive,"" to razz the Dianne Wiest character in ""Hannah."")
Overall, ""Celebrity"" is not a fabulous movie. It's not consistently funny and it doesn't have the touching moments or sweetness of ""Hannah and Her Sisters."" This is a text-book movie to view, though, if you want to see how one of the most famous men in American cinema history pontificates about fame and the price one pays to attain it. It will also prompt you to consider whether mass adoration morally bankrupts the seeker, or is one already lacking in good character when the hungry hunt begins?",1053043200,3,4801,5.293577981651376

1031911,3,6305470499,"Woody Allen has been directing movies for well over thirty years. He has also been in psychoanalysis for perhaps as long, and for several years, I have suspected that the quality of his movies depends on where his angst and his neuroses are at at the time. His films are often autobiographical in nature. We have seen the same themes evolve over the years. This is often fascinating, because we see his views of these subjects change as he grows older.
Celebrity is not a major work by Allen. It is if he is in some emotional crossroads and can not pick a suitable path for the story, which makes the movie choppy. Some scenes have flashes of brilliance, while others work for Allen, but not for the audience. The acting is much less subtle than usual, which may be because the celebrity world it is set in is not known for subtlety.
Lee Simon [Kenneth Branagh] is a journalist who longs for a better life. He has had a couple of novels published. Critics trashed them both, and now Joe is convinced that the screenplay he is working on is the answer. He decides to dump his wife, Judy [Judy Davis] so that he can pursue his dreams. She falls apart, but, in a classic Allen theme, she regroups and becomes a better, happier person, while Lee continues to flounder.
Within the rather slim plot, there are vignettes about various kinds of celebrities, and these are the parts of the movie that often work best. Charlize Theron portrays a supermodel who is the walking definition of shallow. Melanie Griffin is a demented star. Leonardo Di Caprio gives a startling performance as Brandon, a self-centered brat who is America's heartthrob of the moment.
As in almost every Allen opus, the main character falls for much younger women. A new twist here is Lee's adventures with Brandon. He is no match for the recklessness, wildness and stamina of a much younger man. True to the older man / younger woman theme, Lee learnes nothing from this encounter.
People who are not familiar with the director's work will probably be turned off by Celebrity, if only because it is black and white. Those who do not like Allen will find their distaste reaffirmed. Allen fans will be diverted, but will hope that his next project will prove more on target. There is a good chance that it will be, as the director has always been hit and miss. What do you expect from an admitted neurotic?
My list of the best Woody Allen movies is as follows [in descending order]: Hannah and Her Sisters, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Love and Death, Husbands and Wives, Zelig, Bullets Over Broadway, Manhattan Murder Mystery.",1016755200,,2610,4.663774403470716
1031912,2,6305470499,"This comedy is a tribute in the guise of a parody of the great Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini's early '60s classic, LA DOLCE VITA. (Just so we don't miss the point, this was shot in black-and-white, but, unlike the older film, the story is now set in -- where else in a contemporary Woody Allen movie? -- Manhattan, rather than Rome.)
So far, so good. This should well have been another perfectly good Allen comedy, but, alas, he blows it big time by casting a woefully unsuited actor -- not even a seasoned comic actor -- to star in a role screenwritten for the unique delivery style and appearance of, well, Woody Allen.
Allen has said in interviews that he cast Kenneth Branagh in this part because Allen looks too old for it: He needed someone about 40, and Branagh fit the bill.
HUGE mistake. Though Branagh is a distinguished dramatic actor and director, he's totally out of his depth playing a younger stand-in for Allen, much as Allen himself would be if he was to play Claudius opposite Branagh as Hamlet.
Branagh simply doesn't know how to be funny in here. He speaks all the Woody Allen-type lines, credibly recreates Allen's requisite halting patter, yet utterly fails to capture either Allen's, or any other sort of, comic timing. The result is that he merely sounds foolish and pathetic -- too much so to even care about his character.
Allen should've faced facts, bit the bullet, and cast himself in the part. Sure, he's too old, but that could've been easily remedied by changing the story just enough to make that character older. After all, it's not an action movie we're talking here: Make the character 60ish, cast an older actress like Diane Keaton or Dianne Wiest (who're much funnier at playing an Allenesque female counterpart than is the younger Judy Davis anyway) as his ex-wife, cast someone like Judy Davis instead of the glamorous Famke Janssen as Allen's first girlfriend and someone like Madonna or Helen Hunt instead of Winona Ryder as his even more youthful second girlfriend. These modifications would've worked beautifully, making it popular with audiences and critics alike, and made a profit instead of losing the bundle it did.
And what a shame: The movie has some wonderful, hilarious set-ups for Allen's brand of humor -- escapades with a seductive supermodel (Charlize Theron), with a madcap movie star (Leonardo DiCaprio), and at a literary cocktail party. The LA DOLCE VITA parallelling provides a nice framework for everything, but without Allen in the flesh, the completed work suffers badly for want of wit, personality and cohesion.",1016323200,2,2583,4.886104783599089

Pretty much the only thing that bothered me was Kenneth Branagh's performance.  Through out the whole film he attempts to imitate Woody's acting style and it starts to get on your nerves after a while.  However the other great characters and rich plot can help you see past that.  In the end I really wish I could give it a 4 .

However, to be fair, fans of the 'Woody Allen genre' will probably enjoy this Allen formula film.  The angst of the lead character as well as tongue in cheek skewering of the rich and famous abound.

A series of fairly entertaining misadventures commence for both Lee and Robin that lend insight to the life of *Celebrities* obviously filtered through Woody Allen's glasses.

This film by Allen is shot in black & white, is  pretentious, self-serving and self-indulgent.  There is a story in here  somewhere that seeks to explore the nature and effects of fame, but toward  that end the viewer is subjected to a vast array of unsympathetic  characters, mediocre performances and a lot of endless stammering and hand  wringing.  Kenneth Branagh should be happy with this one, however, because  for him there is no place to go from here but up; this is far and away the  nadir of his film career.  He plays Lee Simon, a writer, a role written by  Allen obviously with himself in mind, and Branagh does little more with it  than give a Woody Allen impersonation throughout the entire movie.  Inexplicably, he fails to create any semblance of an original character, so  caught up apparently with ""doing Woody,"" and the result is a ridiculous  caricature that lacks any credibility and is annoying in the extreme.  How  a terrific actor like Branagh, with so many personal tools at his disposal,  could produce such a pretentious portrait is beyond comprehension.  Judy  Davis comes off looking bad as well; playing essentially the same type of  role as she did in Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry"" (which she pulled off so  well), she has been ""over-Woodied"" in this one, taking her character of  Robin (Lee's wife) to a teeth-clenching extreme.  Watching such a gifted  actress give such a fingernails-scraping-the-blackboard performance is  almost beyond endurance.  Also wasted in this film are the talents of Hank  Azaria, Leonardo DiCaprio, Melanie Griffith, Famke Janssen, and Michael  Lerner.  The only actors who managed to keep their heads above water in  this one were Joe Mantegna (as Tony, the only character you could come  close to caring anything about), Bebe Neuwirth (as a hooker), Winona Ryder  (as an aspiring actress) and Charlize Theron, who was probably the most  memorable, in a convincing turn as a supermodel.

7889584,3,6305470499,"I watched Woody Allen's 1998 movie Celebrity again recently, starring Kenneth Branagh. I've heard for years, and know by experience,  that people either love or hate Woody Allen's 'comedy'. And I've said more than a couple of times that I've been watching his movies for decades now, have found them entertaining and sometimes thought-provoking. I guess I would have counted myself as one who 'loved' his movies, or a good many of them anyway. But something has happened, and I come back to it on account of his influence on our culture.

Unlike in the earlier days when I was still wandering my way out of Arcadia with all my half-ripe thoughts, I've been afflicted in the last ten years or so with the uneasy feeling that Allen has to be observed and not merely watched for entertainment. Not that I have not always known that he was part gallows humor comedy, part dark philosophy (with more than a little quirky imitation of Ingmar Bergman, even to the point of using Bergman's famous Cinematographer, Sven Nykvist, in some films, and some of Bergman's famous actors) and, alas, part viciousness. Maybe it was his breakup with Mia Farrow and the revelation of the affair with Farrow's young daughter that finally broke the spell. He thought Farrow had a ""Mother Teresa complex"". All those adopted children!  And Allen had no time for that kind of piety at all.

Whatever it was for me, it involved the realization that after producing his considerable opus over many decades, it was getting near the time to tally up his overall affect on the culture. And so it was then that I started to get an uneasy feeling in my stomach.

 While it is true that in many of his movies he openly ruminates [obsesses] on and argues with God (like Job I thought), it is also true that in his major films another motif runs through, viz., infidelities, sundry affairs sometimes in the same movie and often enough with young bimbos; there is the dismal bondage of marriage (even when one comes to accept it as an inevitable curse); then the hypocrisy of religion,  the ultimate meaninglessness of life and the apparent [tentative I hope] conclusion that one can only hope for ""whatever works,"" whatever gets one through the night, without any meaningful reference to right or wrong. Because for Allen, so far, there is nothing else --- we all go around just once. In one movie a renowned philosopher openly pondering the problems commits suicide in the end.

Allen thus poses as a kind of pop-Zarathustra. And that can't be good. I used to think he was just raising the questions, pointing to the real conflicts in life which can beset one. But where and in what is the redemption? It's simply not there, not even in relationships. It's like he's stuck in Sartre's Being and Nothingness, 1943.

At the end of Celebrity, the Branagh character, who deliberately mimics Allen's neurotic persona and style throughout, after the formulaic infidelities [against his half-crazed Significant Other,  bedeviled with ""Catholic guilt""] and frustrations about not finding serial relationships the panaceas to all his existential frustrations, he finally takes refuge in a movie theater (another Allen metaphor / motif) where the final scene has a woman running away from something as a plane in the sky writes in huge letters for her (and for Allen?) HELP! The picture fades to rolling Credits.

That might sound like a potentially redemptive cry, but, alas, the movies which have come after 1998 have not changed basic course. I hope the gifted Allen has not hardened completely into stone by now. The questions and the guilt can be resolved while he still has breath. But it is getting quite late.

I'm still watching.  Train wreck or redemption,  we'll see. He certainly is obsessed with the  ""God question"". And though a major motif in his movies is his trying hard to put away that question and just get lost in the carnival he wishes life to be, he is too much aware, I think, not to feel anguished, lost and longing in the mysterious shadows and fog of existence.

 That's not always the worst place to be just before the lights go out for good. Anxiety sometimes leads to the truth, or at least to some sense of it.",1508457600,,4197,4.758953168044077

7889589,4,6305470499,"Black-and-white Sven Nykvist cinematography highlights this Woody Allen comedy about fame and obscurity among Manhattan celebs in this film entitled,Celebrity. The screenplay focuses on the divergent paths a couple takes following their divorce. It has an all-star cast. This comedy-drama film is written and directed by Woody Allen.

Lee Simon is an unsuccessful novelist turned travel writer who immerses himself in celebrity journalism following a midlife crisis and subsequent divorce from his insecure wife, Robin, a former English teacher, after sixteen years of marriage. As he stumbles his way through both professional encounters and sexual escapades with performers, models, and other players in the world of entertainment, Lee increasingly questions his purpose in life. He blows numerous opportunities due to his fame-seeking and neuroses. Meanwhile, Robin trades her many neuroses for a makeover and a job with television producer Tony Gardella that leads to her own celebrity interview program. She takes advantage of numerous opportunities and ends up happy and successful.

This film pinpoints the excessive role of celebrities in American culture and their impact in the average American. The black-and-white film is impressive, but the tale is shallow and diffuse and has little to say about our media- saturated life and obsession with fame. It was scattered but it nevertheless managed to be entertaining.",1441497600,,1425,5.623255813953488

After a favorable reception from my recent vintage review of Crimes and Misdemeanors, I thought Id strike while the irons hot and review another Woody Allen film Ive come to appreciate.  Celebrity is a comedy about a very topical phenomenon that has reached an even more unbelievable status than it had 17 years ago when the film was released.  That phenomenon?  That anybody, with a little luck, can achieve a celebrity status and find love. Every character in this film is either famous or in search of fame. Director Woody Allens main thought that he is trying to convey is that celebrityism is not achieved by people who earn it or deserve it, but rather by people who are lucky or more fortunate.

The story surrounds two paralleling main characters Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh) and his ex-wife Robin (Judy Davis). After Lee attends his high school reunion and sees that all of his classmates are boring, old, and balding he begins to go through a mid-life crisis and he realizes that he has never actually felt true love. Accordingly after 16 years of being married to Robin, Lee decides to divorce her. Lee then goes on a quest to find love and fame. Allen places Lee in several situations where he conveys his opinion that we, as a society, do not celebrate the people that we should. First Lee meets the seductive, yet married actress Nicole Oliver (Melanie Griffith), whom he is supposed to write an article about. Nicole takes Lee to the house she lived in as a child, and although she states that she is happily married, she still feels it is ethical to service him orally, as long as she does not sleep with him. She denotes this by saying, What I do from the nick up, thats a totally different story. Here, Allen demonstrates how people who achieve a high celebrity status, come up with a moral system that suites themselves, but not necessarily the rest of society. Her statement, besides having the sexual interpretation, also means that whatever she feels is moral in her mind is therefore justified.  Coincidentally, this echos a similar theme explored in Crimes and Misdemeanors as well.

Next, Lee meets a supermodel (Charlize Theron in one of her first major roles) that is popular solely because of her jaw-dropping good looks. Therons character remains nameless throughout the film. Allen purposely did not give her a name in order to stress how people who see these beautiful people are not concerned with who they are, just what they look like. This goes the same for Leonardo DiCapros character Brandon Darrow. Although he is a drug abusing, woman beating, hotel-trashing brat with no creative vision, he is still considered a huge star because he has got a pretty face.

After the supermodel leaves Lee, he becomes serious with a more practical and logical woman named Bonnie (Famke Janssen). Bonnie is made to seem virtually perfect; she is beautiful, sexy, intelligent, and nice. However, Lee loses interest in her and feels that he has to move on. The importance of Bonnies character, besides the fact that she shows what a shallow and low man Lee is, is that she is responsible for destroying Lees ticket to stardom, which is also directly related to the destruction of Lees chance for love.

Lee leaves Bonnie for Nola, (Winona Ryder) a woman who has been in and out of his life for some time. Nola is an actress with her own career on her mind. She is not willing to commit to a relationship and can not reach an emotional bond with Lee because she is on her own quest for fame, much like Lee.

Lees acts are strongly contradicted by the transformation of his ex-wife Robin. Robin, at first, is shown as a shy, sexually frustrated, Catholic woman. After Lee leaves her, Robins friend books her a session with a famous plastic surgeon that ends up examining her while he talks to a TV camera and interviewer. Robins transformation begins here when she meets Tony (Joe Mantegna) a television producer. Tony shapes her and makes her into a celebrity reporter on an Entertainment Tonight like show. No sequence shows Robins changed lifestyle better that the one near the films end where Robin is shown rushing around the tables of a restaurant, interviewing various stars. She eventually stops and talks to Donald Trump. Trump tells her that he is going to tear down a cathedral and put up a really tall building. At the beginning of the film, Robins Catholic upbringing would have come through and caused her to become highly upset by this statement, however, here Robin simply says, Oh, thats nice. Here we see that although Robin has accepted love and been rewarded by fame, she has lost her identity.

Robin attains fame without even looking for it while Lee never reaches a celebrity status after all of his attempts. This again restates the films statement that love and fame are attained purely by luck.  Allen drives his theme home in an ending scene that is crucial in establishing the films meaning.  First of all it re-introduces the characters to the audience, so we can see where many of them finally end up.  Allens techniques used throughout the entire film prove to be some of his most ambitious. Cinematographer Sven Nykvists eloquent shooting in black and white requires a creative use of lighting. The music is always soft and relaxing. Beethovens 5th and the So You Want to be in Pictures, song are heard throughout the film in different situations. One more solid technique is Allens relaxed cutting rhythm throughout the film. Most of the films shots are long and relaxed. There are very few short or fast paced scenes.  Allen seems to have a lot to say on this subject and with a running time of 113 minutes, this is one of his longest films.

At the end, this is another vibrant and beautifully rich film from Woody Allen both contextually and artistically.  His career is one of reinvention and sometimes that can result in films that are a little ahead of their time.  This is likely the case with Celebrity.  Agree or disagree with Allens theory on love and fame, but to me, this film plays much better today than it did in the late 90s.  A-

Celebrity is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 53 minutes.",1439769600,,6335,4.739090909090909
