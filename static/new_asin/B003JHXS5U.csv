8398134,2,B003JHXS5U,"This is a 1972 documentary on odd habits of people that somehow relate to searching for sex past...or not. It is a confused pointless mess that normally involves naked women from Eskimos to Africa. The film concentrates mostly on the US and Europe to the exclusion of Asia.

The film quality is poor. There are subtitles, but this something that could easily be in English since the entire film is a monologue describing what is on the screen. The DVD doesn't have any extras.",1406246400,,476,4.666666666666667
8398135,4,B003JHXS5U,This strange movie trying to prove how everything around us goes in a wrong direction. The problem is they don't give us positive ideas plus movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. But this flick has redeeming value presenting really bizarre facts.,1316131200,,252,5.023809523809524
8398136,2,B003JHXS5U,"A blatant example of nepotism this time from producer Luciano Martino, director Sergio Martino's brother, who ripped off Sergio's 1969 trash-pic 'Mondo Sex' (AKA 'Naked and Violent', another MYA release you should avoid - read my review), which itself was a 'Mondo Cane' rip-off. Another pseudo-documentary/exploitation vehicle that's just a purile excuse to see a bunch of naked women (and I'm all for naked women) in sexless situations for no apparant reason whatsoever. Forget the X rating too, as there's nothing on display here you can't see these days on satellite at any hour of the day. MYA (an acronym for 'Mislead Your Audience') does it again, recklessly regurgitating poor prints of forgettable films from the past that should've stay buried. Don't say you weren't warned...",1289606400,2,786,5.246031746031746
