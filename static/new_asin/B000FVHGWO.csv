8447142,5,B000FVHGWO,"If you are interested in battleships, and what the U.S. Navy looked like before Pearl Harbor, this is the DVD for you.  It features rare films salvaged from the archives, showing the battleship Navy in all its glory.  Here are the rows of battleships and cruisers with mighty guns, preparing for fleet battles like they fought at Jutland. A pity the U.S. fleet was cripped on December 7th.  Instead these impressive ships would never really be tested in battle -- primarily their careers would be spent as shore bomardment platforms.

Which is not to say there are not aircraft carriers on this DVD as well.  You'll see the Langley, the first U.S. flattop, and also there is good coverage of some of the earliest American carriers including the Lexington, its decks awash in biplanes.

Most of the films on this DVD are silent, but the images are thrilling and there's a passable musical soundtrack, and often there are intertitles.  One film on here shows the crew of a battleship, perhaps the Arizona herself, being serenaded by a group of hula dancers.  It is too bad their reverie had to end, and this whole wonderful era, and time has a way of erasing our memory of it, the movies on this disc do a lot to bring it back to life.",1149465600,,1233,4.572727272727272
