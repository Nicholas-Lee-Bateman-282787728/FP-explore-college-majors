7960244,2,B0000640WI,"Nice DVD which focuses on the last years of his life and a little too much on that deranged person who killed him (if that is the truth). I would have preferred to see more of his fashion, designs, how he became what he was. Then you also have to include his death but not dwell on it too long. the interview with the killer's father is lame as he just wants to get money out of it all. Versace was unique and that is what this dvd should have been about. Overall interesting but if you are looking for biography of the stylist's life then this is not the dvd you want",1191283200,,568,4.035398230088496
7960245,4,B0000640WI,"This excellent documentary primarily focuses on Gianni Versace and his rise to the top of the fashion industry. His killer, Andrew Cunanan, is also profiled, but in less detail than Versace. Nevertheless, this is a riveting and often mesmerizing documentary. Among those interviewed are Versace's partner, Antonio D'Amico,  who provides illuminating details about the Versace family. Others interviewed are those who worked closely with him, photographers (like Mario Testino and Patrick Demarchalier), and other designers (John Giuliano). Although those interviewed provide excellent quotes, it is the footage of Versace at work with the models and the interior footage of his elaborate mansions that are most interesting. Andrew Cunanan is given less time, but many of his friends are interviewed and comments from his father (who obviously has a screw loose and is trying to benefit financially from his son's story) are included. Cunanan's mother is also shown in a brief clip. Author Maureen Orth, who wrote a book about Cunanan, is also interviewed. The most fascinating aspect of the Cunanan profile concerns the murder of Lee Miglin, a well known and influencial Chicago resident and how the Chicago cops tried to pass off Miglin's murder as a random killing when evidence proved otherwise. Highly recommended for documentary lovers and anyone who has an interest in the Versace empire.",1027728000,14,1394,5.394495412844036
7960246,4,B0000640WI,"Although it may not be a completely factual account of the Versace murder mystery, it is refreshing to see that the story is told from many points of view and does not only depend on sensational journalism.  For any true Versace fan there are many beautiful visuals of his homes and designs and some pretty good accounts of certain aspects of his life.  It's sad there were no statements made by the Versace family, however I was surprised to finally hear Antonio D'amico's point of view.  Overall, I do feel it's an interesting selection if you want to know more about the story; probably one of the best yet.  Definitely, a good choice for your DVD library.",1025913600,4,659,4.6068376068376065
