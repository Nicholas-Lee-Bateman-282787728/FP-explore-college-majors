5040221,3,B006ZL2T66,"Just pre-ordered based on the first two webisodes. Not a bad flick, keeping a bit in the spirit of the BSG reboot. Don't understand why the lighting is so bright in certain areas (shower, deck area, etc). Maybe to obscure details that they could not add since the bulk of the sets are CGI? Verdict not in yet on the choice to play Adama. They nailed it with the mini-sode on Razor (Nico Cortez). So time will tell.

Note: All of the BSG sets used to make the reboot were destroyed after filming was wrapped. However they did have a crew shoot 3-D pic of every part of the sets should the series be resurrected or new spin offs occurred.",1352592000,19,636,4.3
5040222,5,B006ZL2T66,"2 episodes in and it's clear that this is something truly worthy of being a spin-off of one of the best and most acclaimed TV shows of the past decade. Syfy will eventually show the entire web-series as one big single episode and let's hope it becomes a series. If not a tv series, at least as an ongoing webseries. Syfy cancelled Caprica pretty early (had it's flaws, but it was genius), so I have my doubts if this network is truly deserving of more Battlestar goodness, since it seems to be more interested in keeping garbage on the schedule. One can wonder if Ghost Hunters will ever win a Peabody Award or be invited by the United Nations to speech about human rights and war politics (no, it won't. Never).",1352505600,9,712,4.442748091603053

The movie is well put together, but it does tend, in small ways - not enough to hurt the story - to veer from what was established in the Razor and the series.  It was great to see the Battlestar Galactica in her prime, fully armored and fully weaponized as a warship should be.

5040282,5,B006ZL2T66,"""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome,"" a 2012 television-movie, originated as a ten-part web series before Syfy televised it on February 10, 2013. The plot takes place prior to the 2003 mini-series and subsequent television series, focusing on Lieutenant William Adama during his first mission aboard the Galactica, where he finds himself drawn into a secret mission that's not what it seems. The story is everything fans love from the reimagined BSG, complete with moral quandaries and a realistic, unglamorized approach to war. Bear McCreary provides the soundtrack, which fully links the film with BSG. Additionally, fans of Caprica will find some nice references to elements of that series here, especially as this partly fills in the gaps between Caprica and Battlestar. Fans who wanted more from this franchise will find this a welcome addition.",1511136000,2,852,5.365671641791045

5040294,3,B006ZL2T66,"This prequel to the 2003 Battlestar Galactica goes 50 years back in time to the first Cylon war when Adama was a brash young pilot trusted with a mission that may decide the fate of the war.

Originally aired as a series of webisodes, Blood & Chrome suffers some pacing problems.  Adama steps off a shuttle, is assigned a ship and sent on a mission of vital importance in a matter of minutes.  Then it's a roller coaster ride as Adama and his companions escape a new threat every 15 minutes with little time for introspection.  Some of the deleted scenes help the pacing, including a sequence that puts several weeks between Adama arriving and the mission that takes up most of the film.  They really should have left it in.

Mainly it suffers from its middle child position, both a sequel to Caprica and a prequel to BSG Blood & Chrome at times feels superfluous, we know what happened before, we know where this will end.  Which is fine, because really we're here to see pretty space ships blow each other up and there is some really good scenes of that.

But in the end the plot seemed too contrived and I just didn't fall in love with the characters like I did with the 2003 series.  The special effects are impressive, the deleted scenes show just how much they could do with virtual sets, but at times everything seems too busy and crowded.

It was fun but not really something you need to hunt down.",1502841600,,1406,4.43579766536965

5040390,4,B006ZL2T66,"The Battlestar Galactica franchise has undergone many revisions since it bowed on television in the late 1970s after the success of Star Wars.  The latest version is Blood and Chrome, which started out as a series of webisodes that proved not popular enough for a full-fledged TV serial, but popular to join together into a full length direct to video movie with additional scenes thrown in.  This product contains both the original web version, and the ""director's cut"" on one disc.  The story takes place in the middle of the Cylon wars, and follows a young Adama as he takes on his first mission as a pilot of a transport.  This mission goes from routine to top-secret as he is drafted into flying to a Cylon planet on a covert mission whose purpose is only exposed at the very end.  The casting is primarily of unknown actors and actresses, the visual style and dialogue is of the same style as the SyFy serials, and the storyline fits nicely in between Caprica and the Syfy Battlestar Galactica.  There is even homage to the Cylon robots of the original series from the 1970's.  The movie's end harkens directly to the human - robot hybrids seen in Battlestar Galactica.  Overall, a good movie that is entertaining, with good action, dialogue, suspense and some comedy.",1465171200,,1274,4.733031674208145

""It's up to each of us to make a difference."" - William Adama

When Ron D. Moore and SyFy channel ended the run of the acclaimed and highly-rated latest version of ""Battlestar Galactica"", Moore then went on to make his planet-based, pre-Cylon BG prequel ""Caprica"". There was talk of a spaced-based ""Blood and Chrome"" series, which would be a prequel about the First Cylon War, with younger versions of the main characters. The series didn't happen, but this very good pilot was shot.  It takes place 10 years into the war and Caprica citizen William Adama joins the war as a pilot. It stars Luke Pasqualino, Ben Cotton, Lili Bordan, Jill Teed, John Piper Ferguson, and Brian Markinson.  Visually stunning, It is mostly about hot battles, brave missions, personal relationships, and slick-looking Raptors, Vipers, and Cylon robots. Visual effects are by Gary Hutzel. Music is by SciFi music master Bear McCreary. Directed by Jonas Pate. This MIGHT have been a great Syfy or TNT channel series. Highly Recommended. Four and half INTENSE Stars!  (Universal.

5040540,4,B006ZL2T66,"I was a man with a dilemma. Having finished watching the Reimagined Series , I returned to other programming TV had to offer.

I found those shows wanting in all the ways BSG delivered so well; realistic and gritty storytelling based on real characters . Enter Blood and Chrome to the rescue. Naturally the sort of deep subjects the main BSG series delved into over four seasons couldn't be captured completely in one sitting. Holding B&C to that standard would be very unreasonable.

The work does deliver where it counts. Characters here aren't two dimensional plot devices, the story isn't a paper thin excuse for action setpieces, and the background behind the First Cylon War itself is also fleshed out.
Fans of what made the BSG series so excellent won't be disappointed in the slightest here.

Some notes; as prior service military Ill address  the bigger in-universe discrepancies between BSG Galactica and the vessel as depicted in Blood and Chrome. In B&C the ship is a brand new vessel in a frontline war , and she's outfitted as such. In the 2003 series, the vessel is a relic on the verge of being retired, and is hastily put pack into service during the events of that show.

Whenever a military vessel, aircraft etc is put aside as a static museum generally ALL gun emplacements, missle batteries, launch systems etc are removed . The barrels will be plugged, the oil and hydraulics drained, and the operating gear removed and retired. Thus in the conversion of Galactica to a museum , its not implausible to picture that most of the Viper launching and storage gear in B&C isn't present post-service.

Hope this helps some folks on the fence. I'm glad I sprung for B&C.",1442361600,8,1685,4.7534246575342465

5040554,2,B006ZL2T66,"SPOILER WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD

Battlestar Galactica was originally a Mormon (!) science fiction series. The new version doesn't seem to feature Joseph Smith's faithful, although I admit I haven't delved very deeply into the franchise. In this prequel, a young William Adama is pitted against Terminator-inspired Cylons on an icy planet deep inside enemy space. The Cylon protagonistas (who are completely evil for reasons never explained) are rogue robots once created by humanity as a servant race.

OK, let me guess. They don't like Neo-Confederate Mormonite slavocrats and want revenge?

Instead of exploiting the social justice angle, our warriors turn out to be the usual run-of-the-mill stereotypes: the young and cocky rookie, the demoralized old vet who can't wait to sign off, and the mystery female who turns out to be a traitor (of course she is, speaking English with a Russian accent and being married to an evil monotheist). And yes, the Cylons look like the robots in Terminator, but I already said that. The obligatory sex scene featuring the young hero and The Woman is there, too. As for the secret mission, it all turns out to be a conspiracy hatched by Earth Command, but this is said to be all for the greater good of the Galaxy and the stupid hoi polloi in the pews back home. Adama accepts this sacred wisdom, gets his fighter plane and continues the war, order restored.

Although I'm not a pacifist (time to bomb those real Cylons of ISIS, maybe?), I can't say I liked the undertone of Blood & Chrome. But then, I haven't watched the rest of the series, so perhaps I misunderstood something

When I really enjoy a show and hate the main character it speaks volumes about the quality of the show. The special effects are out of this world (quite literally) and look better than the series. The images move so fast in the battle scenes it's hard to imagine how much was involved in creating the CGI visual effects. I think one reason the show was not picked up as a series was the amount of time spent on this green screen production. With 80% of the images on the screen being CGI it's amazing how real it looks. The sets look so real it's amazing. If you're into CGI you'll have to watch the bonus feature about the VSX.

5040630,3,B006ZL2T66,"It was an entertaining couple hours, but it's just not up to BSG standards. The characters are one-dimensional and the focus is on bravado and action. Not a bad thing, but there's little of the character exploration we've come to expect from BSG. I get that they were going for ""Top Gun in space"", which is great - in fact Top Gun is one of favorite movies - because that movie has heart as well as bad-ass action. The Blood and Chrome sets also really just annoyed me. Galactica has apparently been redesigned by JJ Abrams with really really bright lights and shiny surfaces that shine is everyone's eyes constantly. The overuse of lens-flare effect was almost comical. The scenes aboard Osiris, especially it's last moments, were more reminiscent of what we expect from BSG: sweaty, gritty, heroics on a human scale.

The only thing Blood and Chrome had in common with the 2004 series was the sound track - awesome percussion, wordless vocals, and the opening shot of Galatica even uses a revamped theme from the original 1970's Battlestar Galactica, which fits the moment and the mood perfectly. I though that was kind of cool. The last scene with Adama finally in his coveted Viper almost made me wish they'd taken this series and run with it, and maybe it would have hit its stride - I guess we'll never know now.

Oh and the passive-aggressive anti-piracy warning at the beginning of the half-a$$ed movie I JUST PAID FOR - straight up insulting. Not cool guys. Not cool.

But, despite all of this, it's still about a million times better than whatever ghost-hunter reality TV crap SyFy is showing these days.",1431302400,,1614,4.716312056737588

5040635,2,B006ZL2T66,"I've watched the first quarter of the film and had to stop. I don't know what's to blame: my expectations being a fan of the 2004 reboot, or the film itself. It started off alright, the first few minutes were at least enough to get me to stay for a while. But then, shockingly, the hotshot pilot turns out to be a cocky, annoying goon and I'm sorry, but I have a very hard time linking this younger Adama to Olmos's Adama. His name might as well have been George. It starts to go downhill fairly quickly, with an Abrams Star Trek intro where we have the ""hero"" look out the shuttle window to the ship. The whole scene where Galactica is introduced felt so ripped off, it stole away most of the excitement I felt to see Galactica again. Once you're introduced to Galactica interior shots, I was let down further, especially in the hangar bay. I realize the budget was thin for this, but my gosh it was bad. Again, I get the sense that this is trying to be like ""new"" Star Trek, with the hangar deck looking very much like a mixture of the new Enterprise set and the old Galactica set, but the scale and other elements simply don't make sense. I understand that this is set in Galactica's past, but the ship didn't shrink as it got older, so the hangar deck should feel roughly the same and have similar elements, but it just doesn't. Then we're treated to perhaps the worst over-use of lens flares I've seen in my life, and it's so incredibly distracting that I don't even remember any dialogue from those scenes.
In general my impression is that this was an attempt to reboot a recently rebooted series in the same way that Star Trek got a reboot, using a lot of the same elements and tools but without the same budget. There isn't anything that I've seen so far in this film that makes we want to watch it. I feel no interest in any of the characters, not even William, because even though his name is William Adama, he's not William Adama at all. Trying to take a gritty, political, space opera and turning it into mind-numbing CGI everything is not what I would call a good effort.",1429401600,3,2084,4.346153846153846

This movie takes you back to a young Bill Adama, how he was back then ( a young cocky pilot) and you even see how he got his name ""Husker"" which you see on the side of his Viper ( his deck crew restored it) in the Series Pilot. This takes place around the time of the first Cylon war, and  I think is an interesting and entertaining addition to this collection. I wish the series itself could have kept going, or even if they could have picked up where this movie left off. But it's possible the same thing would have happened, as in the Caprica series.

5040820,5,B006ZL2T66,"I  f you liked the original series this is a nice re-visit. Much more potential as a pilot than the Caprica series, however best stands as a stand alone movie and nothing more. I don't feel that either premise was the correct approach to spinning off the BSGjr series, but B&C had a lot more action and promise. I understand that with Caprica they were trying to slow the pacing down from the base series and with B&C they were trying to speed up the action. Maybe the story has been told and there is not a cogent alternative to the original series. But I would think if you have a pacing that worked and garnered good reviews that your probably best to stick with that.
  As far as green screening everything, I suppose it was ok for a pilot, but the idea they had to do the entire series this way was seriously flawed.  I hope that NEVER happens with any series. (I wrote a comedy play for a youtube series about this type of premise a few years ago. Never thought I would see it actually happen in my lifetime.)

5040836,2,B006ZL2T66,"I am a huge BSG fan and have watched both the fantastic 2004 reimagining and the genius pin-off Caprica. Tonight I treated myself to this pilot that didn't get ordered to series after all. According to this show's creators they wanted to create an action packed thrill ride in which they totally succeded, hands down. The problem is that by being that and only that no kind of serious story or plot development was allowed or able to take place. After having just watched this failed pilot movie I couldn't even describe its basic plot because I just got hammered with one epileptic and incoherent battle sequence after the other for 90 minutes straight. Where the reimagined BSG series focused on character drama, the sense of being helpless and the true horrors of war this is like a Top Gun wannabe with spaceships and, of course, young main actors. Back in the 90s, the Wing Commander video game series showed how that premise could be brought to fruition in a proper way, on this project however I found that I couldn't connect to the story or tonality of the show at all. One aspect of this is the fact that aside from John Pyper-Ferguson and Brian Markinson not a single actor actually known to me or with some kind of artistic resume was cast in this show. That is not to say that they performed badly, I just believe that a show within the revered Galactica franchise should in fact have some bigger names attached to like Mr Olmos on BSG and Mr Stolz on Caprica. Probably the biggest issue for me however and also one that I would have struggled with immensely had this project in fact been ordered to series no matter if and how the storyline and character interactions would have developed was the fact that the entire show had been shot in front of green screens and that not a single set had been built for it. Don't get me wrong: I have always immensely admired the BSG inhouse effects team for their great efforts on a television budget no less, but this time around they still only had so much time and money and it just shows in the final product I am afraid. The effects are great but noticing that not one frame was shot in a practical set but each and every time in a virtual set that is at least to me clearly recognisable as such was massively irritating for me. This show is not Avatar or Sin City nor do I believe it should be. I must admit I do in fact find it lazy to even consider creating a Galactica spin-off and then be to cheap to build a single set for it. In the bonus features the effects guys are obviously proud that they did pull off creating the entire show in post production, but in the process I believe that most of the emotional value that actually makes a show great gets lost. Of course many of the effects showed things that could not be done practically and they sure evoked a sense of awe, but  knowing they were just effects made the experience just stale. The whole thing basically looks like a cutscene from a video game for one and a half hours and comparing that to real acting with real sets, interacting with real objects thorughout BSG and especially Caprica it just falls very flat. A movie maker which I can't seem to remember once stated that a good effect is there to support drama and the movie, here there is basically nothing but one giant effect and believe me, that won't age well. Summing up my review, I found this creation to be a great tech demo for the effects team but largely devoid of any dramatic content whatsoever, obviously aimed at an audience for which the intelligent approach of BSG or the cerebral aspects of the fantastic spin-off Caprica were just a little to complex and that would rather watch a non-stop action generic B-movie instead. Compard to both its predecessor shows I could not find one thing that this show would be superior in and I sincerely hope that this little movie will not be the last we will hear from a franchise so begging to have more of its backstory told. A great TV show works because all the many aspects it is comprised of work great together. On this show, many aspects were coveniently left out and made the final product a rather empty shell I am afraid...",1409270400,,4173,4.440677966101695

I see some comments bemoan the lack of depth for the characters, but there's only so far you can go in a 90 minute show.  I agree the re-imagined BSG was terrific as a character-driven story that also happened to be action/sci-fi, but we had the benefit of watching the characters develop over several seasons, and I think ""Blood & Chrome"" was very comparable to the re-imagined pilot in that regard.  From an effects perspective, this show surpassed the series hands down, and that's due to the versatility provided by being done almost entirely in CGI (one of the bonus extras on the DVD goes into good detail about that).  The only slight disappointment was that the bonus deleted scenes were obviously cut early on, before the CGI was done on them (so lots of green screen and ""insert cylon here"" placeholders); but I guess that's understandable and the deleted scenes were still useful as they filled in a couple of points in the story (e.g., origin of the term ""husker"").

The entire background and sets are all created on a computer, yet they look very real.  It's the only way a show of this magnitude could be filmed.

Hardly deserving of the Battlestar name, everything about this series is sub-par (save for the visual effects, which are mind-blowing by TV budget standards).  However, it works better watching it in its complete form, as opposed to the webisode format.

The ""plot twists"" at the end, don't stand up to scrutiny (seriously, there are some glaring errors that I can't understand -- I suspect they must have been network-mandated changes at the last minute), and Ben Cotton is painful to watch.  Also, the entire premise of this movie clashes with some pretty explicit dialogue presented in the BSG:Razor ""minisodes.""

5041003,3,B006ZL2T66,"Not great.  The plot was just OK.  The biggest issue is that there is absolutely no risk to the main character (Adama) because you KNOW how his story ends decades later.  The charm of the reimagined BSG drew, in part, from the uncertainty of who's a Cylon, etc.  In that show, real characters died, or were maimed, or ended up not being who they thought they were...  That guessing game was most of the charm of the show.  To try to do a prequel where you already know a lot of the outcomes is just not gripping.  Whatever happened to Adama, you knew he was going to be OK & begin a long & successful carrier in the fleet, and that took a lot away from the dramatic tension.

Also, I felt that the visuals were chaotic & it was really hard to tell what was happening.  It looked great, but often did not know WHAT looked great.

The acting, etc. was fine, but I thought that Adama was an odd casting choice.  Edward James Olmos has a large build, and not that I ever thought about it but I would have imagined that Adama in his youth would have been a bigger framed more muscular person - the guy playing him was very thin & slightly built.  Other than his height & hair color it is hard to imagine him growing into the man we saw on the 2004 series.  It's a small thing but it did sot of seem ""off"" to me.

To be fair, if this had aired 1st I'd probably be setting my DVR and looking forward to each episode.  But since this is after the 2004 series it seems pointless and redundant.

Yes, a beat sheet must have multiple *pulses* and a *heart.* Rookie acting; the misguided writing and directing decision that earlier versions of characters (e.g., Adama, Tigh) should be _tabula rasa_ instead of simply *less deeply _embodied_ forms of the same spiritual people*; and a stingy score that seemed to abandon ship at important moments.  .  .where to begin in naming priorities in a triage of this mess?

The sets are virtual, which creates some exciting visuals but robs the series of its characteristically naturalistic production design. They whiffed badly on the casting, with the main cast ranging from forgettable to embarrassing (in contrast with the array of stars the original BSG picked largely out of nowhere). There are also an enormous number of BSG guest stars recurring in this cast as different characters from a different time, to the point where it's quite distracting to anyone who watched the show.

The highlight is the electronic-infused score. As to the rest, it's a mediocre action piece full of nonsensical jumps, comical caricatures, and a plot that says very little. Of course, BSG set a high bar, and this miniseries is at least better than some of the trashy entertainment out there, but it isn't very good.

I mean, I just don't even know what they were thinking! This series was too wonderful to be picked apart for scraps by people who clearly don't understand the show or remember the actual facts from the series. Whoever wrote this story didn't even have the common decency to make this movie line up with the Razor Flashback webisodes that we all watched about six years ago. The only thing they got right was the snow and the body parts, but didn't include ANYTHING ELSE from the webisodes or even suggest that those moments happened at some point, meaning that at least one of these stories isn't canon. My money is on THIS movie not being canon. Some of the concepts were interesting, like the character of Rebecca Kelly. But her story just didn't fit with everything we already know about William Adama.

I really wanted to like this, because I could never quit BSG, and I will watch anything that ever gets made with a BSG logo on it. And I think the people who created this film were relying on fans like me to bring in money, regardless of how awful the story was. This just really didn't do justice to the series and its magnificence at ALL. I am very disappointed. After watching it (and during), it just felt like someone had killed my dog.

I recently heard rumors that they're coming out with another BSG project. If it's anything like this, please don't go through with it! Please stop making BSG spin-offs; quit while you're ahead. BSG and Caprica were great. Let's not ruin them after the fact.",1387324800,4,1656,4.498338870431894
5041127,3,B006ZL2T66,"I enjoyed this, but it lacked the emotional depth that made BSG one of my favorite series of all time.  Many of the characters seemed overly-cliche, especially after having exulted in a series whose strength was that it made us see humanity in a new light.  The men were muy manly, grrrrr, which was fun but in retrospect felt shallow and almost cheesy.  See below the spoiler alert for my opinion of the main female character.

The deleted scenes should have been kept in the main story.  It was sort of sad to watch them without CGI in many cases, since almost the entire set had to be rendered digitally.  They helped me care more about Adama, and gave his relationships depth, rather than the otherwise-inexplicable abrupt respect and desire we saw emerge from his co-pilot and passenger - without more context in which we see him kick serious butt while somehow fitting basketball-size nads into his flight suit, this made his character feel somewhat like a Mary Sue.  Nevertheless, I would have loved it if this had developed into a spin-off series.  I can't help it, I think I'd watch anything from this franchise.

SPOILERS FOLLOW

Seriously, a fracking femme fatale bordering on a Bond Girl in a series whose female characters were always so complex, skilled, macho and unfrothy?  Every other time we saw a betrayal on BSG, the motivation behind it was presented with sensitivity, the inner conflict in the treacherous character was explored carefully, and we saw how it ripped them up to feel cornered into making the choice they did.  Not so with this lady.  This dippy flapjack trod the worn-out trope of being resented for her authority over the men, desired for pretty much just her looks (because she had no character to speak of), and turning on humanity because bending over in the face of an overwhelming threat _always_ works out great - amirite ladies?  Let's risk our lives in a hopeless one-way mission just to grease up the rest of the species for conquest.  Sure!  That's consistent: brilliance and suicidal daring always go hand-in-glove with craven submission.  Right.  Because she's a girl, so naturally submission is the default even if she has to thread through battlestar wreckage while under cylon fire, fall 50 feet, battle snow monsters, hike through an icy wastleland, and shoot the people who've been on her side, all the while risking discovery and execution by her allies, in order to get the KY on the target.  Because yes, surrendering to machines makes perfect sense, since obviously machines have compassion and/or a use for a slave race, not.  She should have crucial insight into the nature of the Cylon since she helped design their minds, but she was very wrong.  No software engineer would be this much of an illogical bimbo.  This character was so disappointing and unbelievable that at the end of the show I was left with the impression that the writers were teenagers.  The fact that the men didn't shoot her in the face instead of leaving her where she lay once they knew what she was doing was the last straw.  Her character was treated as a 2-dimensional ""lady"" instead of a person, which is a massive regression from previous BSG standards.  At least she got to be used for the only thing a lady is good for, though?  So the entire thing wasn't a big fat exercise in disillusionment for our boy Adama?  Oh goody.

Okay, I got that off my chest - now for the reason I wanted to write a review.  I'm a skier, and there are a few things that would have absolutely delighted me.  Since there was a major scene in a ski lodge, it would have made perfect sense for the characters to have ridden some snow on their way to the objective.  Picture it: three badasses getting all XXX on the slopes while being pursued by cylons on skis, who are, get this, cruising down the mountain at 60 MPH in a power wedge.  So great.  It was awesome that they portrayed the fabled snow snake (something we joke about with kids when they fall, that a snow snake grabbed their ski) - but man, cylons on skis, maybe built right into their bodies, would have made my day.  Picture them catching huge air while firing on the humans.  Pew pew pew!  And then wrecking into flaming chunks!  LOL!  Yard sale flambe!  It's not like this humorous diversion would have detracted from all the psychological profundity that was missing.

Sidebar: Snowmageddon was also ruined by - in addition to the entire plot and all the special effects - the lack of awesome snowriding shots.  Seriously, a movie set in a resort town with world-class snowboarders as characters, and one pathetic shot of laddering is all we get??  GO BIG OR GO HOME.",1387065600,2,4653,4.665847665847666

5041133,2,B006ZL2T66,"As a prequel to BSG,  the plot had merit, but the way it was carried out left a bit to be desired.

One thing I can't stand in a story is a ""stupid hero"". I thought the character of young Bill Adama was a much too cocky know-it-all, for someone fresh out of an academy, entering a war that's been ongoing for 10 years. He also had a seemed to lack an appreciation for the people who had been fighting it.  The writers should've done some research here, because in real life, youngsters like that are put in their place VERY quickly by the more experienced veterans. I found it very hard to like him.

He did some smart things, beyond what one would expect of a rookie pilot (unrealistic), but he also acted inexplicably stupid at times, which I also found unrealistic.

Even the garbage compactor monster from Star Wars had a cameo role.  Just unbelievably bad and did nothing to contribute anything meaningful to the reimagined BSG universe.

For me, the late 70s feel may have been the only thing missing but I can even work that out in my head. The story is set in the first Cylon War when Adama was a rookie pilot. So everything will be antiquated from what would be to come. The Cylons weren't all shiny and didn't have the cool electronic voices that I love (missed that alot). Glad the vipers and razors were kept largely unchanged. I really hope they make more movies rather than this be a pilot for a TV series. I think it would be better that way. All and all I think BSG has been redeemed by this movie. I didn't like the remade TV series and feel they should have left it alone. For true BSG and sci-fi fans I recommend this Blu Ray DVD definitly worth the money. By the way, I was 6 years old when the original TV show aired.",1379289600,2,958,4.074074074074074

With few exceptions, all great looking work.

With the advent of Bluray, I've been far more discerning in my video purchases, replacing and adding only key movies and tv shows in my collection. This is one of them.",1379289600,,576,4.693069306930693
5041206,2,B006ZL2T66,"Including the Bluray and DVD together is a good value, however I did not find the movie a good continuation of the Battlestar franchise. The title is somewhat odd, as they removed the Chrome cylons from this movie that are supposed to be there at this early time. But there is plenty of blood!

Loosely based on ""Gun on Ice Planet Zero"" from the original series, this direct to DVD movie does nothing to tie together Caprica with the 2nd series. This franchise clings to life like a moaning Centurion. Where to begin on the problems here?

The Cylon base star can spew out 200 Cylon Raiders in .3 nanoseconds, all twirling at impossible-for-humans g-forces. We are shown one of these old Base Stars hovering over a major city as it is being wrecked. This base star looks enormously more expensive in materials and technology than the 50 megaton nuke missiles they used in the 2nd series pilot. The disparity in effectiveness is embarrassing between that pilot and what these base stars could do 50 years prior. Why switch to cheap missiles later on? Why can't a base star hovering near a major city cause more damage than what we are shown? Serious plausibility issues here, how could the humans not have lost the 50-years-ago war in a matter of days? The old Cylons are seemingly invincible and perfect, they would never have needed Baltar to open the computer defenses, if they had 50 years to improve on what we see here.

The jumping off ship (""Osiris"") has very poorly matched CGI with the human actors in their cramped bridge. They take damage that appears to blow up their entire human component section, yet we switch to the actors who are shaking around with steam and sparks. If the Cylons can overtake human ships this quickly with just the first shot, why was this war taking so long for the Cylons to win? The more effective they show the ""scary old Cylons"", the more unbelievable they ever got to film a 2nd series.

Lots of issues with what we are shown. Why do humans routinely fly around without their spacesuits on? Those bubble canopies do not look too sturdy (as we are reminded in the opening minutes of this movie). The dumbest part was after the Cylons had consolidated their hold on the orbit of the ice planet, swarming the planet with Cylon raider patrols and a deadly base star, a ""rescue ship"" somehow bypasses the certain death hovering above and rescues our heroes. How? No explanation for stupidity, with a final kitchen fight scene ripped off from the original Jurassic Park (replace cgi velociraptors with cgi junk-face Cylon centurions). What happened to the centurion look that they were supposed to have 50 years ago (on ""Caprica"" and ""Razor Flashbacks"")? Why does the dual Vulcan cannon on the raptors (the ship not the dinos) look like they weigh substantially more than any other system on the jump-capable starship? Would they really designate more room to aft weapons than fuel or radiation shielding systems (which is a clear plexiglass bubble canopy of questionable value)? Finally, why wasn't everyone in Battlestar Galactica's hangar bays blinded by the ridiculous LENS FLARE from every direction? A blind crew is the best way to beat the ""toasters""?

Speaking of the toasters, I was vaguely uncomfortable with the racist terminology involved. No issues raised here for the audience of the moral issues of humanity verses machines. The story closes with the head machine telling the activist that they hate her as much as the other humans. Does hate seem like a useful component of machine intelligence? Nothing was explored here as to motivation, this could have been explored more. Nothing wrong with action, I hope the cast has more opportunities in future installments.",1379030400,,3718,4.830455259026688

5041213,3,B006ZL2T66,"This is a difficult review as I am a massive fan of Battlestar Galactica, and would argue it is one of the best series of all time.  The entire series, all four seasons, including the standalone films Razor and The Plan, fill a world out like no other.  Sadly, Blood & Chrome is beyond low budget and adds next to nothing to the BSG universe.  Actually, as countless others have said, it kind of takes away from it as it flies in the face of continuity that has been established and will leave true fans scratching their heads.  I have never been one of those that is against blue and/or green screen as I think it can look outstanding and often keep the budget down.  Here, though, it's humiliating.  The lense flare is laughable as it is in every single scene at a level that boggles the mind.  Had that been taken out, I wonder if it would have been much more watchable.

The story itself is not bad, but, again, does it fit into the established universe?  I'd argue the IDEA shown does but the execution of it does not.

In the end, do you like BSG?  Then you owe it to yourself to own the four seasons and Razor and The Plan.  Blood & Chrome can go either way, almost like flipping a coin.  If you wish to complete your collection, then, of course, pick this up and hopefully you will enjoy it, but if you do not get it, you really never need wonder what you missed as you missed nothing.",1377907200,2,1393,4.231060606060606

5041237,1,B006ZL2T66,"This just sucked.  I'm sorry, but it just proves to me that Eick really is not the creative force behind Galactia.

I think they made this more action oriented because of all the complaints about Caprica not being like Battlestar Galactica.  Caprica was never supposed to be like BSG...it was supposed to be about how the Cylons turned into a people that turned against their creators.  It dared to do this and so was hated.  This piece of garbage instead tried to be like the most action oriented of all the BSG episodes. The problem is that not only did it take that way too far, but it also waited until the very end to finally talk about what happened during all that time after Caprica.  It really didn't give any new back story, and that was the only reason I wanted to see this new film in the first place!

The Cylon snake was the moment when I wanted to punched the television.  This was a direct violation of the BSG Bible in keeping things ""naturalistic"" instead of going off into typical Sci-fi.  RDM always was adamant that the action was part of the lives on Galactica but it was ultimately about the characters.  This went off into ""pie in the sky"" science fiction.  There is nothing wrong with ""pie in the sky"" sci-fi.  But, BSG and Caprica were compelling character studies.  That is why I loved both shows so much.  They simply were compelling, because you came to know each character as a genuine human being (or Cylon!).

I wonder if David Eick might be the reason behind this tragic episode in the BSG universe.  He did write the stupidest episode of the entire BSG Universe with ""Hero.""  ""Hero"" was so awful, so stupid, made no sense in any context.  The whole idea of them letting some pilot that looked like Bob Marley go free because somehow the Cylons knew that Adama just happened to be the one who shot him down was simply absurd.  And, this movie or webisodes or whatever the frak it is supposed to be is just absurd.

So, I think I will choose to ignore ""Blood and Chrome"" completely.  The idea that the android at the end sounded like Six was also completely stupid beyond belief.  The humanoid Cylons were created by the Final Five (and Cavil helped with the others).  Why couldn't we have had a movie about the Final Five arriving and creating the humanoid Cylons and then Cavil killing them and that plot line.

The problem was I simply did not care about these characters at all.  They did not engage me.  They were all new and all boring.  At least Dean Stockwell was wonderful with not-so-great material in ""The Plan.""  This movie was the worst episode in all the BSG history.",1376784000,3,2613,4.478813559322034

Now back to Blood & Chrome, this starts off before Galactica and for me works very well to explain things. I thought for unknown actors they did a good job playing the parts.

5041327,5,B006ZL2T66,"""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome""

Originally presented as a series of webisodes, ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" is a tense, stylish prequel to the super-faboo ""Battlestar Galactica"" series, featuring Luke Pasqualino as a still-green William Adama, fresh out of the academy and eager to battle the Cylon horde.

""Blood & Chrome"" is well-written, well-paced, and has surprisingly good graphics and special effects for what was essentially an on-spec pilot episode. It plays well as a movie-length film, and the only downside is that the powers that be at Sci-Fi (or any other cable/digital/broadcast entity) didn't green light this to become an ongoing series. Yes, the ""Caprica"" prequel turned out to be pretty dismal, but this show looks much better and more tightly focussed, and raises a number of interesting, unsettling issues about the history of the Human-Cylon conflict. Fortunately, Pasqualino is pretty baby-faced and young: I suppose it's possible he could still take up the role later on if the BSG creative team can get this series off the ground, even if it takes a few years.

Anyway, if you're a Galactica fan, have no fear: this is exciting, satisfying, intelligently written and well-made.  It's no ""Caprica""; you will enjoy watching this show. The only problem you'll have is when it ends and you realize, that's it -- that's all she wrote.  Sigh. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1373068800,,1418,5.17467248908297

Over processed grainy picture, shaky camera and lens flare usurped the storyline and was very distracting. I was happy to see the Extras on the disc to actually see the fellows responsible for this as they pat themselves on the back for such a great recreation. At least with older films, we can remaster the original. Unfortunately, they created this as a ruined work of art from the beginning and there will be no turning back.

5041424,3,B006ZL2T66,"Blood & Chrome is a decent enough movie, but it feels spiritually distant from Ron Moore's BSG television series. The TV series had a much grittier, real-world feel. Blood & Chrome by contrast feels a bit more Hollywoodized, like what I'd expect if Hollywood took over the franchise. Seems like there's more of a focus on battle scenes and adventure than the sort of intellectual/moral questions that the TV show explored so capably. It's not a bad movie, but it's like the equivalent of JJ Abram's Star Trek movie for the BSG franchise.

Blood & Chrome also seems inconsistent with the characterization of Admiral William Adama from the TV show. Luke Pasqualino lacks the sort of intensity that Edward James Olmos brought to the character. Pasqualino's Adama seems too flippant, too much the hotshot. He also seems too thin and tall to be Adama. By contrast, I thought Nico Cortez did a much better job bringing the character to life in the TV movie Razor. According to Razor, Adama's first mission wasn't a space battle, as the character claims he hadn't gotten any kills yet, so the plot also seems inconsistent.

I think Blood & Chrome could have avoided some of these problems by just not using Bill Adama as the main character. If you're just looking for an adventure set in the BSG universe, I think Blood & Chrome will do you well. However, don't expect a revival of the TV show.",1368489600,,1387,4.703703703703703

First, the lens flair was too much. It didn't look at all like flair but exactly the effect I get on my smartphone camcorder when there's finger oil all over the lens. I suspect this was done to hide the low special effects budget. It would have been better if they'd left it out. My wife couldn't even finish it. It was giving her a headache.

This needed much more story development. Introduce the main character and shove them into a movie with two other unknowns on something very narrow. The whole thing felt like video game story.",1367712000,,721,4.413533834586466

I think it gives an exciting, action-packed glimpse into the first Cylon War through Bill Adama's first mission.

I realize that the production values can falter in spin offs from time to time, but this was pretty deplorable. What is with camera flare in the future? Seriously, once or twice is kind of visually interesting, but the whole movie makes me think you're just trying to hide the nonsense you don't know how to shoot.

Somewhere along the way it became a web series only, not to be broadcast on Sci-Fi (or SyFy).  Once the promise of higher production values was off the table there was little hope that the story would be coherent or that the characters would have any real development.  One can only do so much in 5-8 minute spurts.  Taken as a whole we get a mostly entertaining story that largely doesn't hold up to scrutiny.  The special effects are actually not bad considering what they had to work with.  Lots of detail in the background that is at times distracting, but mostly fun, providing realism to completely fictional situations and locations.
Overall, there isn't much here.  The plot does not make sense.  The big reveal at the end invalidates the entire narrative and some of the performances are not good.  If you are a big fan of the show you should pick this up only to round out your collection.  We'll never get the Ron Moore series again.  Caprica died a premature death just as it was getting good.

5041694,4,B006ZL2T66,"In 2004, the sci-fi series ""Battlestar Galactica"", a re-imaging of the 1978 series would be featured on the Sci-Fi Channel.  From its three-hour mini-series and four more seasons that would last through 2009, the series would receive critical acclaim and would win countless awards.

The original series was about humans who have lived in peace after a war against the cybernetic race known as the Cylons (robots originally created by humans and later rebelled).  With humans living in planets known as the Twelve Colonies, the Cylons launched a sneak attack on the colonies and literally causing devastation and death to the the human population.  Only 50,000 of the billions of humans survive and those who do survive are escorted on civilian space ships.

The series would introduce the Battlestar Galactica, a military capital ship that survived attack but was to be decommissioned.  And the responsibility of taking care of these humans on his ship is Colonial Fleet Officer Commander William ""Bill"" Adama.

And would feature the adventures of his crew as they would try to find a safehaven for humankind, to find the Planet Earth and to find a way to defeat the Cylons.

To best explain how or why the humans created the Cylons, a prequel that takes place 58 before the events of ""Battlestar Galactica"" was created and the series was known as ""Caprica"" (which would last one season) and would feature the father of William Adama.

When there was discussion to make a ""Battlestar Galactica"" prequel as a video game with live action cut scenes, the plan was to create digital reconstructions of the sets of ""Battlestar Galactica"" but set around 40 years before the events of ""Battlestar Galactica"".  Creating a virtual set, SyFy was pleased with the development of the project and wanted the storyline that was created to be made into a two-hour pilot.

So, in 2011, shooting began for the prequel known as ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" which would originally be planned for an online release.  By November 2012, the series would be released as ten 12-minute acts and was featured on Machinima.com and was aired on SyFy in February 2013.

VIDEO:

""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 widescreen).  The film was 90% pre-production, so a lot of what you see on screen is visual effects.  Cast was shot with green screen and the visual effects team worked their magic to make this film look good.  And I have to agree, the visual effects were fantastic!

From the look of the ""Battlestar Galactica"" and its interiors to compliment the timeline of a younger William Adama to the look of a chilly frontier or battles in space, the film/online series benefited from today's technology to make things integrate with the cast members and nothing looks fake when we see the characters and the backgrounds/visual effects.  Everything looks real, well-lit and for the most part, looks fantastic on Blu-ray.

I didn't see any artifacts, banding or any negative issues during my viewing of the film.  ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" looks great on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The overall film sounds very good with directional audio being used during the fight scenes through the surround channels.  I was hoping for a bit more immersion with the surround channels and also LFE, but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack was good.

Subtitles are in English, Espanol and Francais.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  Deleted Scenes - (29:22) Featuring 13 deleted scenes (note: deleted scenes are with green screen and not with finalized visual effects).

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a fan of the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" and also even more of a bigger fan of the first three seasons of the re-imagined ""Battlestar Galactica"", watching ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" was a positive and enjoyable experience because it made me remember why I enjoyed the re-imaging to begin with.

One thing that made me angry about re-imagining was where the writing went in the fourth season.  Having come out strong in with the first three seasons, I felt cheated with the fourth and with ""Caprica"", it was not what I was hoping for.

""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" was exciting, action-packed but also featuring a storyline that is not too convoluted with characters.  The original kept introducing people and not knowing how to keep those characters going and it became a matter of ""who do we kill of"" and ""Who should we make into a Cylon"".  And unfortunately, those situations were the sign of the times (mid-2000s) and we saw it with ""Heroes"" and ""Lost"", introducing too many characters and not knowing what to do with the.

So, the efficacy of ""Battlestar Galatica: Blood & Chrome"" is that it's essentially about three characters.  Sure, there are many other characters introduce in the series, but the writers use these characters as a base for the three primary characters.

William Adama is an ensign that is so full of himself.  Macho playboy fresh out of the academy and is so cocky, you can see what his son in the future, Lee Adama, was able to inherit from his father.  But for this film, it's about how a character grows and most importantly, seeing close-up of how the war was nothing like he expected.  Things that you were taught at the Academy were not necessarily true.

Opposite to Adama is Lt. Coker Fasjovik, a man who has come close to death many times and with a month left on active mandatory service, he just wants to live and see his wife.  But he has been pulled into this mission which was supposed to be routine, but ends up being his most deadly mission that he has ever experienced in his lifetime and now he's not sure whether or not he will survive.

And then you have Dr. Becca Kelly, the beautiful engineer that help create the Cylons.  A woman who is determined to complete her mission which hundreds and thousands of people would sacrifice their lives in order to make sure she achieves her mission.

But what is that mission?  That is what audiences will find out as writers set the audience up for something surprising but also a fitting ending of this film that makes you craving for more.

The Blu-ray release features the unrated version not seen online and I'm not entirely sure how many minutes are added to the unrated version and what the primary differences are but there some visuals that may be a little gory or a very short steamy love scene which was nothing to watch your back over.  But I would assume it's the former and what the three characters find inside of this ski resort, now being used by Cylons.

Picture quality is fantastic, considering that the series is nearly all created in post.  The film is pretty much using current technology to showcase visual effects without using actual sets.  And a lot of acting within green screen.  And what I liked about this film is that the visual effects integrate with the characters remarkably well.  There is none of that fake background scene look that you often see in films, the crew behind the visual effects did a great job of making things look real.

And it's a shame that the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series didn't have the same technology that they do now (or perhaps they did but it was too expensive) because the visual effects team really did a magnificent job.  May it be the flights in outerspace and the battles that take place.  To the overall look of the Battlestar Galactica, looking robust and new as it was featured 40 years ago with interiors that look fresh and new, not like the decommissioned, old version that was featured in the TV series.

But the picture quality on Blu-ray for ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" is fantastic.  I didn't see any artifacts or any problems whatsoever.  Lossless audio was also well-done.  Maybe not as immersive as I would hope but there was still good directional sound coming through the surround channels but was looking for more immersion during the fight scenes and a bit more LFE.  Special features included nearly a half hour of deleted scenes but also a cool featurette on the visual effects.  Wish there were more special features (perhaps I have been spoiled by the previous ""Battlestar Galactica"" season box sets which included many extras) but for the most part, this Blu-ray release is quite solid!

Overall, ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"" was fantastic.  It captured the spirit of what I enjoyed about the re-imagined series (the moments I enjoyed from the first three seasons) but most of all, keeping things simple for the pilot, focusing on three primary characters without trying to bulk up the story with convoluted storylines of other characters.

So, the pilot was fantastic, acting was also well-done and visual effects were stunning.  I really do hope that a TV series does happen for ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"". It contains the magic and also the action of what made those first three seasons of ""Battlestar Galactica"" so fun and exciting.  Wonderful storytelling and I hope that ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome"" does become a TV series or even an online series, because the SyFy channel needs more quality sci-fi shows and this film showed promise.

Exciting, action-packed and thrilling from beginning to end, if you enjoyed the re-imagined series of ""Battlestar Galactica"", you will enjoy ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome - Unrated Edition"".  Recommended!",1364601600,,10211,4.929198361614979
5041695,4,B006ZL2T66,"An interesting storyline depicting Bill Adama as a newly commissioned officer on his first assignment and mission with the Colonial Fleet. It has lots of action and is well put together, even if the movie was digitally rendered on all the backgrounds for the most part. A couple of the story details do not concur with what we know from watching the series and the movie Razor, but it doesn't take away from the overall connection with the entire series and its history. It is nice to see the Galactica in its prime and what it was like during the early days of the first Cylon war.

5041724,4,B006ZL2T66,I hadn't heard about this prequel movie till I saw it on Amazon. I LOVED the BG series and hated it when it ended. So it was nice to see something new.

5041727,3,B006ZL2T66,"As far as the look and feel of BSG Blood and Chrome is spot on. With just enough mix of the out of date tech we see in the series with the advanced tech of Caprica, Blood and Chrome looks and feels amazing. The story; however, is lacking. I was hoping to learn more about the evolution of the cylons from toaster to skin job as well as greater insight into their developing beliefs about humanity and independence. Instead I was given a story about a young Odama being the pawn of a secret military mission to give humanity an edge against the Cylons and go on the offensive. The characters lacked depth and emotion so it was hard to really care about what was happening to them and the idea of ""what does it mean to be human"" was completely absent as the Cylons, with a couple of exceptions, were acting as mindless robots hell bent on our destruction.

If you're looking for a bit of nostalgia and same amazing special affects in the BSG universe with minimal advancement or building of the mythos then you'll be satisfied watching this film. But be warned you hard core fans; this is NOT a movie that will engage your sense of wonder and mystery about our humanity.",1364428800,2,1168,4.407407407407407

5041731,2,B006ZL2T66,"This completely lacked the charm of the BSG series, and you never really got invested in any of the characters.  Half way into it we were hoping it was going to end soon.",1364342400,4,170,4.151515151515151
5041732,5,B006ZL2T66,My husband is a huge Battlestar Galactic fan and had been waiting for this to come out on DVD.  We had it shipped as soon as it became available.  He really enjoyed the storyline.,1364256000,,179,4.235294117647059
5041733,5,B006ZL2T66,"For all those die hard Battlestar Galactica fans, this is one for you.  It's fantastic.  The plot is good and it is very much in the same style as the previous installments.",1364256000,,173,4.375
5041754,5,B006ZL2T66,"There are no other words that can describe this prequel other than ""fracking awesome."" Although I will argue that I wished SyFy (god I hate typing that idiotic name) just aired this in the first place instead of 10 minute segments per week, and then having to wait forever to be released on disc/digital to own format. But maybe it was the smartest way to increase the fan anticipation for more Battlestar Galactica. Well, for somebody who refused to watch it on youtube, my hype was matched accordingly. The entire duration of this prequel was worth more the viewing time than the entirety of other prequel series, Caprica. I guarantee that if you were a fan of the 4 season Battlestar Galactica, you will be demanding more after the credits roll.

For the other things that come in this pacakage, what is there not to like? a DVD, Blu-ray copy, DVD, digital, and...well there is UV, but at least 3 out of 4 things are worth having in this package. Blu-ray quality is awesome just like the Blu-ray versions of the main series. Even though there was a tremendous, (in fact more than BSG) CGI used, it still looked a hell of a lot better than Lucasfilm's prequels. My only complaint was the strange J.J. Abrhams lens flares. Other than that, it was scifi thrill ride. To be honest I think only nit picky people will have issues with this package.

Totally worth it's price. Enjoy it!",1364169600,,1382,4.5910931174089065
5041755,3,B006ZL2T66,"the special effects and quality of the video were excellent, but the story itself lacked.  while the premises of the story was good the way it was told lacked. like the ending of BSG on Sci-Fi Channel",1364169600,,200,4.405405405405405
5041756,2,B006ZL2T66,"If you're as big a fan of the Moore/Eick ""Battlestar Galactica"" reboot as I am, then you eagerly dove back into that world when B&C was released. I originally started watching it online, but after 2+ installments I quit. I decided to watch it as a movie. So, when it premiered on the Syfy channel, I eagerly sat down to watch an early adventure aboard the Battlestar Galactica.

Unfortunately, the Battlestar Galactica was hardly in the movie at all. Virtually the entire story takes place away from the ship. I might not have minded that if it were a GOOD story, but I found it weak, as if someone threw a bunch of note cards together and called it a script. And then there are the VFX. There was so much much lens flare and what I refer to as halo-lighting (intense background lighting that bleeds over around the edges of foreground objects...and people) in this movie that it made J.J. Abrams' 2009 Star Trek farce look like it didn't have any by comparison. I found that terribly annoying and distracting. I have the good fortune of having a way to contact VFX supervisor Doug Drexler directly. I discussed this issue with him and he explained that work lights on the flight deck could very well cause this effect. Okay, that makes perfect sense to me. I've seen such lights cause that effect in real life. However, that doesn't explain its presence in the rest of the film. In the end, I turned off the television after the movie feeling quite disappointed in what I had just watched.

BUT... they were soon to release an uncut, unrated edition on BluRay! Surely THAT would be much better, as all those minutes that had to be cut for television would be restored! I bought it, and watched it... and except for a two-second side shot of a woman's naked breast it's the same film. That's right. The ONLY footage in the uncut unrated version that wasn't in the televised version was that shot.

I REALLY want to see more adventures in the BSG universe, but if they produce more I hope they will return to what made the series so good.",1364169600,5,2037,4.514905149051491

5041783,5,B006ZL2T66,"I hated the BSG remake; Razor was a nice separate effort, but generally - unlike so many viewers out there, I simply did not like the second BSG series.  That, reader, is caveat one.

Caveat two:  Witness the smoking crater left behind by Lucas' Star Wars prequels.  Yes, you must.  Many viewers felt that performances were flat and appearances were off when actors simply moved in front of a greenscreen.  Somehow, the result felt as flat as a weather report.  Since all the physical sets for BSG II were struck and sold off years ago, everything in Blood and Chrome would have to be done in prequel fashion - all against a greenscreen.

Hmm... caveat three:  Many viewers compare Blood and Chrome's geeky young Adama unfavorably with the husky Husker shown in Razor years ago.  They point out that impetuous young pilots are a cliche.  True and true, but remember that Blood and Chrome features Adama senior on his first mission out of the Academy.  His physical and emotional type is therefore apt.

Some hate the ""video game feel"" of Blood and Chrome.  Indeed, Blood and Chrome was originally meant to BE a video game, but just grew and grew.

So how can I like it?  Let me tell you.

First, the look:  I hated the hastily-constructed sets of the second series with a passion.  They lacked detail and texture.  Since the premise involved humanity eschewing computerization due to the possibility of Cylon infiltration, all that glorious ""electronic wallpaper"" that ol' sci-fi consumers like me like simply wasn't there.  In Blood and Chrome, the effects designers weren't constrained by physical or budgetary constraints on sets.  The wartime hanger bay and bridge are feasts for the eyes, making the second series' sets seem even more wretched in comparison.

Second, the plot emphasis:  BSG - in any iteration - should be a war story, not a prime-time soap opera.  The endless exposition of the second series, leavened only with a small sprinkle of nice exterior effects shots here and there, is reversed here.  This is wall-to-wall action.  If your preferred entertainment is to see endless human/human, human/Cylon, and Cylon/Cylon bickering (the holy ""conflict"" espoused by embittered Trek expatriates like Moore), it is not central here.  Don't worry; there's plenty of moral ambiguity in Blood and Chrome, but it's not virtually the only thing.  An extended dogfight inside a space wreck does feel ""gamey,"" but many a good film adaptation feels ""stagey;"" it doesn't ruin the entertainment value of the film.

Third, the antagonism between the sexes in Blood and Chrome is more tolerable than in the second series.  There is better balance here, with no Starbuckette chewing the scenery.  Inevitably, there is a flitting appearance by a proto-Number Six, mouthing her holier-than-thou's, but not enough to ruin the recipe.

So if your tastes are like mine, enjoy.  If not, just pop the second series into the player and have some ice cream.",1363910400,,2950,4.953061224489796

Edgy and unapologetic without being hopeless.  Great use of CGI to make the show appear far more expansive (and expensive) than it really is.  I agree that sometimes the effects take over the show, but this particular outing seems to have strong characters and a story that could have stood above the effects.

Perhaps Ron Moore not being involved with the project is the reason that it doesn't quite reach that emotional chord that the reimagined series touched upon. Perhaps the timing just isn't right because of the allegorical nature on the previous series in conjunction with our post 9/11 world view... when it was still a fresh wound on our national psyche here in the US.

With that aside. I felt the plot was fairly engaging, with enough twists and turns to keep a fan engaged. The acting is pretty much pair for the course of the entire series, no one give a bad performance and there are definitely several memorable performances in my opinion. I thought that several of the differences between the series and the movie created a feel that this was really taking place 40 years before the series, which was appreciated.

5041890,4,B006ZL2T66,"This tells the story of a young Adama, and one of his first missions after being assigned as a pilot on Galactica. The story takes place after the events of the Caprica series and long before the Battlestar Series picks up. You get a bit of insight into what he was like in his youth.  They very much portray him as a hot head who is always looking for a fight.  You do not see any of the characters from the original series.  At this point the Cylons are still just the chrome versions, although see the beginnings of the ""skin job"" versions at the very end.

It seems people fall into a couple different categories about this.  Much like the Caprica series they either love it or really hate it.  I liked the series, but was not so devoted to seeing just those characters that any kind of spin off would be awful.  It is really just an extension of the universe that was created for that story.  It is like a long episode, telling a single story and that is it.  It does have some twists and betrayal going on much like the series had.  In the beginning of the story it makes it seems like the war could end, but of course there is no big resolution at that point.  No you are not going to get Edward James Olmos as Adama, but if you can get past that and just enjoy the story and the fact that you are getting new Battlestar stories in some form, then this is worth adding to your collection.",1363305600,,1395,4.167910447761194

5041893,4,B006ZL2T66,"Like so many others here on Amazon, I wish that Syfy would pick up this pilot and bring BSG back.  It is a solid production and certainly better than any of the other shows Syfy is currently offering.  There are moments that seem borrowed from JJ Abrams, Star Trek such as an opening scene similar to Kirk's Kobayashi Maru test and Adama's first encounter with Galactica, ""This is the girl that's gonna give it to ya..."".  Awkwardly, there's also a reference to Galaxy Quest when Adama flies his raptor between the ""squishy-smashy"" things in the Archeron's still active jump drive.  Despite all that, this production has the heart of the BSG we know and love.  the characters are passionate and heroic. I think that Luke Pasqualino does a fine job as the young Bill Adama.  The Cylon Centurians are vicious and frightening.  I wish that they had been given more screen time.

I understand that Blood and Chrome was shot completely in ""green screen.""  I have to say that it is impressive.  The lighting and color palette is other-worldly.  Yet, I wasn't distracted by it.  In fact, it added to the ambiance and mood. I highly recommend Blood and Chrome- especially if you are a fan of (both) original shows.",1363219200,,1206,4.690476190476191

5041896,4,B006ZL2T66,"I have mixed feelings about ""Blood and Chrome.""

Considered as a ""thing in itself,"" and forgetting for a moment about its connections with Battlestar Galactica, I like and respect it. It has good effects, reasonably good actors, and is a tightly told story.

But in the context of the regular BG series, overall it seems a little shallow.  It's essentially BG re-imagined for a young male adult audience (18-23 year olds) (playing up the military experience, young men proving themselves, a (very) little sex and a lot of explosions).  The story isn't bad - it makes a nice prelude to BG in its way, and also references the spin-off series Caprica.  The plot is pretty good but suffers a little from having been broken into bite-size chunks due to its being originally formatted as a web series.

Are these things bad?  Not necessarily. The unusual pacing (due to the webisode story story structure) is a little jarring at first, but once you get into it it's fine. The producers know their audience, and tailored Blood and Chrome effectively to that demographic.  Like the title implies, there's lots of fighting and testosterone.  I would say if you're young, and a guy, and can relate to the ""young man goes to war"" fantasy elements, you'll probably enjoy it... what's not to like?  If you're female, and/or older, you may find it less engaging, lacking in some of the more subtle and disturbing elements that made Battlestar Galactica such an effective commentary on the human condition, and so interesting to watch.",1363132800,,1520,4.8565891472868215

5041999,4,B006ZL2T66,"I am a huge fan of BSG and own the entire series on Blu-Ray.  When I heard initially about Blood and Chrome, I was really thrilled that we might actually see a new series come about taking place in the BSG universe.  Then i heard that Sci Fi decided against another TV series.  Then I heard that this was made into a web series.  For some reason, I never looked for it.  Boy was that a mistake on my part.

So I watched part of it on Sci Fi the other week but sadly had to switch to watch The Walking Dead (no this disk is not better than The Walking Dead).  However, the amount I did watch made me really want to purchase this.  Now, having watched it all the way through, i have to say that Sci Fi passed on a real opportunity.  If the producers could make what they did with the effects and budget that they had, and make people want to watch it and own it, that really says something.

Understand that there aren't big name stars behind it, although there are a few faces that you will recognize.  Also realize that the special effects aren't up to Avatar standards, but then BSG really never rested on that.  The story is good and engaging.  The performances are better than anything on the CW (ok, faint praise, but still).  And it sets up an intriguing story line with more than a few threads to tug on.

In the end, this could have been a show well worth watching.  And the disk is well worth seeing.  Do yourself a favor if you are a BSG fan.  Watch this disk.",1362441600,,1469,4.148936170212766

So the movie kept itself very true to the original show and filled in some blanks along the way. I just keep wishing the original show would come back and pick up where it left off or at least make a few more movies like this one. Please,1362441600,,550,4.009090909090909

5042003,1,B006ZL2T66,"Having been a big fan of the 2004-09 BSG series, I watched this new ""movie"" with fairly high expectations.  The fact that Ronald Moore's name is no where to be found on it should have been clue that this was not going to be good. However, I certainly did not expect it to be as bad as it is.  The thing that was so great about BSG was it's ability to constantly surprise the viewer, to provide those ""Holy crap I can't believe they did that!"" moments.  In comparison, Blood and Chrome is stale boring typical TV.  Every character is a paper thin stereotype and every plot development is obvious from a mile away.  The only good thing I will say is that the production values are OK, assuming one likes lens flares.  Obviously there is a lot of CGI, some of which looks good, some does not, but this was true of the 2004 series as well.  Really, it's the writing that kills this show, but there are other problems as well. I made a list of them.

*Warning, Spoilers Ahead!!*

1. Cliches abound.  Every bit of dialogue at the beginning of this show sounds like it was copied from every other film you have ever seen about military pilots/soldiers.  It's not original nor is it interesting.  The ""cocky young pilot teamed with jaded short timer"" thing was particularly irritating. Kinda like Lethal Weapon in Space.

2. Why is Captain Kelly a space marine decades before he was born? Does this mean he was a cylon too?  According to Battlestar Wiki, at least 12 of the actors in this film appeared in either BSG or Caprica, or both!  In a few cases, these were pretty memorable supporting characters like Captain Kelly or Jordan Duram.  Considering that BSG is about cylons that appear as multiple copies of the same person, recycling actors in this way is a really bad idea.

3. Why do the cylon centurions look new?  Shouldn't the centurions look like the old school chrome models that were in the flashback scenes in BSG Razor?  I found it funny that a show with ""Chrome"" in the title did not use the chrome toaster model centurions.  And why did the centurions eye not move back and forth?  It's the one instantly recognizable feature of all cylon robots and they didn't use it.  Lame.

4. Cylon snakes.  Seriously, what the hell was that?

5. The plot was a bit convoluted to say the least.  From what I can gather, the plan all along was to rely on a rookie pilot to transport a (secret) human traitor through cylon territory to meet up with a group of (dead) space marines so she could reveal the location of a secret colonial fleet.  This was all done as an elaborate counter intelligence operation to lure the cylon fleet away from where the colonials plan to attack.  I'm no military genius, but what is the point of intentionally revealing to the cylons the fact that there is a secret fleet at all?  To gain the element of surprise?  They already have that, its a secret frakking fleet! Anyway, with FTL drives giving both sides the ability to appear instantly where every they want, aren't all attacks surprise attacks?

6. After traipsing through the barren frozen wastelands of CGI Hoth, Adama and co. find a ski resort.  His copilot plays the piano.  Adama gets laid.  This is supposed to make us feel bad for Adama when he later realizes she is a traitor and leaves her for dead.  At least that's probably what the writers thought.  It doesn't work.

7.  Apparently, cylon centurions groan in agony when they die.  Not sure how this makes sense on any level.

8.  In almost every episode of the 2004 BSG firearms were barely effective against cylon centurions.  In Blood and Chrome a pistol is powerful enough to destroy a cylon raider with a few shots.  Fired from the open cockpit of a viper.  I am not making this up.

9.  Remember how in BSG Razor they got an actor that kinda looked and sounded like a younger Bill Adama?  This time they didn't bother with that little detail, instead casting some guy with zero screen presence.

10. We learn that FTL drives are kinda like the chompers in Galaxy Quest that exist for no other reason than to provide a deadly series of obstacles for our protagonists to escape through using proper timing.

Since Ronald Moore was not associated with this sorry excuse of a movie, I think we can regulate it to ""non-canon"" status.  Think of it as fan fiction with production values.  That's really all it is.",1362441600,24,4359,4.517285531370039

It is not uncommon for films of this genre to take a bit of liberty with logic but this goes well beyond that.

5042107,4,B006ZL2T66,"The original release of this on Youtube was brilliant and took me back to the Friday night block of SyFy Channel programming that included Stargates, and BSG many years ago. With that being said this prequel is as imperfect as any pilot with strong moments that stand out. Rarely have we ever seen a Sci-Fi pilot that is five stars and gets it right the first time so be careful when judging this against the rest of BSG. If you remember the pilot of the re-imagined BSG was darkness, mixed with hope at a mismatched pace and it's important to keep that in mind when viewing this. I'm going to skip the CGI, set, and design portion you've already read about and talk about some of the standout scenes.

There are many great scenes in this pilot that help it stand up strongly when viewed over. One standout scene is the initial approach of Adama's shuttle to Galactica and how the wide angle shot establishes that this is a majestic, legendary ship (even though it's best days are to come). The director plays right into your probable love for the re-imagined series and how excited you may be to see this young, aggressive ship.  Later in the prequel as our trio is deep into space many of the flying shots are a classic combination or fast motion close-ups with some typical BSG-style shaky camera action. We finally get to see Adama as the hot shot pilot who is almost as good as Starbuck and where hiss military mind and strategic planning begins as he makes an on the spot decision to ""thread the needle"" similar to how Starbuck ""brought in the cat."" The next paragraph contains some spoilers so read it with care.

One of the most emotional and well written scenes in the film is aboard the Osiris. We get to see Sgt Hadrian and Lt. Kelly recast as strong characters who understand their duty and believe in their mission. This is straight military sci-fi in that you have service members that understand their duty and what the success of their mission means to the greater effort. The moment where Commander Ozar touches the crewman is not only for reassurance, but is also to recognize their friendship, service, and confirm what must be done. This moment speaks volumes to me not only as a combat veteran, but an avid sci-fi fan. You begin thinking of all the sacrifices that have been knowingly made during the war and how a lot those are about camaraderie. THIS is the ethical part of Blood and Chrome that I feel may have been missed by many viewers.

In the reimaginged BSG many of the ethical questions are approached from a political or religious angle while this show tries to make this more apparent, they fail in the dynamic due to the weakness of the writing for Adama and further attempt to shore it up by overwriting for Cooker which is held together by the acting of Ben Cotton. Blood and Chrome has the potential to ask many of those lingering questions left over from our more recent conflicts and potentially become a lesser ""Band of Brothers"" set in space. For this to happen the writing would need to be addressed, the visuals and lighting need to be darkened (watch the BSG pilot compared to 33). I hope this gets made into a series as we're hard pressed to have any quality sci-fi let alone any military science fiction.",1362009600,3,3250,4.55042735042735

It's a shame this wasn't turned into a TV series as originally intended, only becoming a web series and ""TV Movie"".  It has amazing potential.  After all, we know basics about the first Cylon war, but the specifics?  All the large-scale battles and small-scale special operations?  All the people who became legends during it?  The evolution of all the cylon human and non-human models?  Nope, we haven't seen all that.  We WANT to see it.  But Syfy is all about ghost stories, reality shows, and wrestling.  WRESTLING!?  On SyFy?  How about we change the name back to SciFi, bring back BSG as a full prequel that takes place during the first Cylon War, bring back Firefly to pick up 5-10 years after the events of Serenity, and show old episodes of Farscape, Trek, & the various StarGate offerings?

Oh, that's because SyFy has gone the way of MTV.  The name no longer represents the programming. It's a random hodgepodge of crap that has forever removed the SyFy channel # from my brain's rolodex.

Maybe AMC or TNT would take it?  Or Starz...Seriously.  The best shows these days are on HBO (Game of Thrones, Deadwood, True Blood, Eastbound & Down), Showtime (Dexter, Californication, Shameless, The Borgias), & Starz (Spartacus)

I'm scrabling to find my Premier Episode Disk of the series, just to see his Viper that they brought back to the Battlestar's Museum.  The title ""Husker"" never made sense and to see it as a term of derision and then later a call sign was great!!!  You see where Adama become jaded and that too was part of the series that made it ""human"".  Too bad the folks who run the SCI-Fi Channel will run something like this as a one off, but not sign on anymore for a full Sci FI series that isn't Monsters or Vampires.  This series was such a refreshing change from ""SyFy"".  I'm sorry, buy Sigh is more like what the channel has become, outside of this.  I know this was mostly CGI, but it was done so well that in my book, it set a new standard.  Where an episode might have 10-13 scenes that were entirely CGI, this was all done in Green Screen and then later the Galaxy or the large landing bay was created behind it.  This series could be recreated on the cheap, using CGI instead of sets and still draw me to watch it 2-3 times on TV and then go buy the DVD.  I couldn't be happier with my DVD, unless it were to carry more hours of the series than the DVD has.",1361923200,,1268,4.056224899598393

The incredible story of a brilliant idea in need of an outlet details how audiences very nearly never saw Blood and Chrome: it was variously attempted to be released as webisode, TV pilot episode, TV movie, and ultimately web series / direct to disc movie. While the BSG fan in me laments that this promising movie wasn't picked up to start a new BSG series, I am also glad that I had the opportunity to watch the movie and at least briefly return to the BSG fictional universe. If you enjoy BSG this Blu Ray is a must purchase!

But if you are new to the series, or new to BSG universe, I cannot recommend jumping into this movie first. Due to budget and many other constraints the themes of personal conflict, spirituality, are perhaps not as well developed as in the series.

As it stands the story deserved distraction because it was so ridiculously obvious from the macho military posturing to the pre-requisite romantic entaglement and the inevitable betrayal.  I believe in the potential for any story to be well told, and fans of sci-fi know shows like this have a life all their own, but this is best discarded and forgotten.

I want to start off with my beloved bucket.....THE GALACTICA herself. They had two versions of her in Blood & Chrome. Two different crews desigend their own version. WTF? The first version was awesome, but you could tell it was incomplete. The first 4 to 6 batteries they show from the aft topside looked to small and you could see they didn't look apart of Galactica. Then they put 2 batteries over where the nukes should have been. Those who know battships know there shouldnt be batteries over the bridges that connect the flight pods to the mainship. STILL, IT LOOKED INTIMIDATING. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS MODEL.
Now the second version was designed by someone who doesnt unerstand the design & armor thickness of a warship and the excessive consentration of batteries placed in one area. The head of the Galictica.
Anyway, enough of that.
William 'Bill' Adama aka HUSKER. Now if you know Edward James Olmos, you know why he's named HUSKER. Now in 'Razor' Nico Cortez was a perfect fit playing the younger Adama. This kid playing Adama now is no 'HUSKER', HE JUST DIDNT FIT. HOW DOES RAZOR + BLOME & CHROME EXPLAIN Admiral Adamas background? The BSG ALUMNI did a great job. LSO Cpt. Kelly, NARCHO, Spl. Gage, KAG Capt Taylor, Sgt. Hadrian did a great job. COKER MADE THE MOVIE. I just want to add the unrated version is the same as the webisodes and the Feb. 10 debut.

( This show which I watched on instant video is a good flick in itself). It features a young William Adama as he joins the fleet and goes on a secret mission into the cylon controlled space. As a pilot it didn't work because the show left the galactica and went on a mission instead without the viewer getting to know the cast of the future series!.  That fact probably blew it for the network. Still it's a good story and we do get to see a battlecruiser battle a basestar. This would have made a fine series if they had made a second episode which takes place on the galactica and we would then  get to know her crew!. That's how the show should have started out probably. But scy fy shifting away from science fiction series of their own making , we will never know.  They could stop making endless bad saturday movies and instead get a new stargate of galactica show up and running. BUt who knows. I saw the unrated version which has one shower scene that is unrated , other than that the show is the same. In hd the effeccts looked great and it's just too bad this fine effort didn't see fruition as a series. But at least we finally got to see it. I don't own the blu ray but will eventually get one.

It was everything a die-hard sci-fi fanatic would want: great actors, cool special effects, good balance between action and storytelling, and wonderful writing.  I spent the summer after the series finale catching up on everything that came before it.  So, when Battlestar Galactica: The Plan was released, I purchased it without hesitation.  Boy, was that a mistake.  After just watching the entire series, BG: The Plan offered nothing new.  Then Caprica came along, failing to capture the storytelling magic of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series.

Enter Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome. WOW!  Rekindling all that made BG so enthralling, it was a good movie that left this fan craving for more.",1361577600,,799,5.2362204724409445
5042267,2,B006ZL2T66,Not enough cyclons and I couldn't identify with the characters.  It was a boring prequel.  No more back story than we already knew.,1361577600,8,131,4.6521739130434785
5042268,4,B006ZL2T66,"Trying to piggyback off the success and cult following of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica series from Ron Moore, Blood & Chrome gives us the story of a young William Adama and his first mission as a member of the Colonial fleet. Fresh out of the academy, Adama (played by Luke Pasqualino) is assigned to the powerful battlestar Galactica, where he's met with contention from his co-pilot Coker (Ben Cotton), and is assigned to escort a beautiful but mysterious woman (Lili Bordan) on a secret mission.

Originally shown in small ""webisodes"" online, almost every shot from Blood & Chrome was done on green screen. The result is A LOT of CGI, most of which looks really great. The space and aerial battles especially look marvelous, and the few Cylons you see look really good as well. There were a few action and landscape shots I thought looked kind of cheap but overall, when you consider almost the entire show was created in post-production, the effects rival a lot of shows on TV today and look very similar to those seen on the BSG series.

Blood & Chrome was created with hopes of getting a series order in mind, which probably won't happen, and because of this the story and character development felt rushed to me. There's really only the three main characters, none of which I really got attached to, and a few other supporting characters that had a few lines. Perhaps because the creators thought they would get a series out of the show, they were going to save some of the backstory and further development for later. However, as it stands the 90 minute show doesn't really tell you much about who these characters are or what brought them to the Galactica. It also didn't help that the cast is made up of relatively unknown actors who, thought they try, don't have the chops to keep up with the actors from the reimagined BSG series. The story was fun and engaging, I just wish there had been more depth.

The Bluray set comes with DVD and digital copies, as well as a few extras including a bunch of deleted scenes and a making-of featurette that delves into the visual effects created for Blood and Chrome. This behind-the-scenes feature is quite interesting to watch as it interviews most of the people involved in the creative process behind the special and gives some awesome insight into the development and creation of making a show that's most computer generated.

If you're a fan of the Ron Moore, series I would definitely check this out. It's not quite up to par with the series but is still a fun adventure that will make you want to revisit the sci-fi series.

On a side note, the 188 minutes Amazon lists as the running time is inaccurate; the feature itself is around 90 minutes and I think Amazon added the Bluray and DVD discs together.",1361577600,,2769,4.642857142857143

5042299,5,B006ZL2T66,"I'm glad that the new BSG corrects a few issues with the previous series. For one, this isn't as intentionally grainy. The visuals are sharp and clear making the BR edition look gorgeous (there was no reason to get the series on BR because they didn't look much different from DVD or even a poorly ripped digital). It also doesn't get into the new age faux-Mormon religious mombo jumbo. It is just good solid exciting SciFi. The story reminded me a bit of John Scalzi's Old Man's War series and Red Shirts in that it was brain candy for lovers of SciFi.
Like many SciFi fans, I am disappointed with the lack of hard SciFi on TV. I bought this in an effort to help support the genre and show that it can be profitable to make. Many studios just don't want to make it because of what was called the Pearl Jam Effect back in the Napster days. That would be where an audience of a type of art are more likely to pirate content then pay for it. I can't help but think that there is a relationship between the lack of new SciFi on TV and the popularity of it on the torrent networks. I'm here to say I like my pew pew and I'm willing to shell out some ISK for it (side joke for Eve Online fans).

5042315,4,B006ZL2T66,"Battlestar Galactica was one of the strongest and most successful series that Syfy ever made because of its strength of characterization, complex moral issues, fantastic writing and compelling story lines. New management at Syfy wants to capitalize on the success of the series, but shies away from the very things that made the series great in this prequel to Battlestar Galactica set during the original Cylon war, featuring a young, brash and inexperienced William Adama, so different from the redoubtable, stalwart Adama we came to know during the series. This would be fine and a way to deepen the character if the writers hadn't used every possible cliche for the eager young man full of idealism and vinegar but lacking in experience.

The show opens late in the Cylon War with a just qualified William Adama coming aboard Galactica to begin his service as a pilot. He is disappointed to be assigned to raptor duty and argues the decision. His world weary navigator looks on in amusement and dismay, in fact this character is the strongest character in the movie. The war is not going well and Husker, as Adama is known and his navigator are sent on a mission to get a scientist to a place she needs to be to possibly affect the outcome of the war, an abandoned winter resort moon with a Cylon station on it. I did like the homage to The Empire Strikes Back in the setting of the winter moon and the monster in the cave that almost kills the intrepid hero.

I'm always happy to watch Battlestar Galactica and will watch the series if Blood and Chrome is picked up, but hope and pray that the writers are allowed to transcend cliche in plot and character as evidenced in Blood and Chrome as currently constituted. The journey from innocence to experience is ever green in terms of story telling, but readers and viewers need to get something other than the hackneyed to buy into the concept. I know Caprica was criticized for being slow moving, overly complex and despairing, but Blood and Chrome is an over correction in that it is a paint by the numbers tale of a young man gaining his first battle experience.

The main moral conflict, that of the scientist Adama is ferrying around a battle has potential but is examined too facilely. Didn't the Cylon War ultimately end because the Colonies took on her pragmatic approach? Wouldn't it have been more interesting if that was addressed rather than the straight on black and white, good and evil adventure tale we are given? Blood and Chrome was entertaining for ninety minutes and I will always support the franchise with my wallet and with my reviews in the hopes that we get another series as great as Battlestar Galactic, but Blood and Chrome, while it had potential, was a mere shadow of the series. Recommended to fans but not a good entry point for newcomers. Newcomers should start with the original mini-series which is astonishing.",1361404800,3,2899,4.725296442687747

5042319,4,B006ZL2T66,"""Battlestar Galactica"" is the franchise that will not die. The original television series in the 1970s was cancelled because of the cost of production. It was then revived for a short-lived budget-crunched version named ""Galactica 80,"" which brought the rag-tag fleet of star voyagers to the Earth and less special effects. The franchise was kept alive throughout the 1980s and 1990s by way of comic books and novels.

2003 saw the launch of the rebooted version of ""Battlestar Galactica."" After a mini-series, the television show went on for four seasons. It also spawned two TV movies and several web series. ""Caprica"" premiered in 2009, proving once again audiences just couldn't get enough of this sci-fi phenomenon. Unfortunately, the show ended abruptly after two seasons.

""Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome"" once again proves you can't keep a good show down. Originally filmed to be the pilot for a new SyFy Channel series, it was decided to split it up into 10 parts and aired on Machinima.com as a web series. The entire pilot has now been reassembled and made available on Blu-ray and DVD in an ""Unrated Edition.""

Young William Adama graduates from the Academy in the tenth year of the First Cylon War. He's appointed to serve aboard the Colonial Fleet's newest battlestar, the Galactica. His first assignment is as a pilot for a Raptor transport ship. Adama, his co-pilot Coker, and former Graystone Industries employee Dr. Beka Kelly are sent on a secret mission that will take them deep into Cylon territory.

I refer to ""Blood and Chrome"" as the ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" of the epic ""BSG"" franchise. It takes place between ""Caprica"" and the 2003 series. Just like ""The Clone Wars,"" there's a surprise tie to the rebooted series as well. As R2-D2 and C-3PO do for those particular films, we have a certain character that ties the different eras together here.

Director Jonas Pate takes series creators Michael Taylor and David Eick's script and successfully drops us back into the world of ""Battlestar Galactica."" Pate has a history working within the universe, having helmed episodes of both ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Caprica."" This helps give ""Blood and Chrome"" a familiar look that matches that of the earlier shows.

The audio and video high-definition transfers give us a clear picture and highlight a brilliant score by Bear McCreary. Exceptional clarity does make the lens flare and blurred masking of some of the green screen shots more evident. However, for a television show it looks phenomenal.

There are a couple lengthy special features included in the Blu-ray edition of ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome."" A 23-minute featurette entitled ""'Blood & Chrome:' Visual Effects"" takes us behind-the-scenes of the production. 13 deleted and extended scenes clock in at 29 minutes and show us what ended up on the cutting room floor.

""Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome"" is another essential piece to the franchise puzzle for fans. It will satisfy their taste for more of this intriguing and complex universe and its characters. As a big enthusiast of all the shows myself, I look forward to more movies like this in the future.",1361318400,4,3173,5.053537284894838

The actor playing adama is not as bad as some critics say, remember this was only a pilot and the characterization takes time. The action sequences for space battles are excellent. The film shows how a series could have been made as Ensign Adama works his way to commander over time. The Galactica remake lasted for four seasons and this one could have too.

It could not have lasted an other year, Battlestar Galactica was an excellent series,but it was based on the running away defensive war . The battle scene's was supper. The story line excellent , but it was a remake and the out come was some what known. Blood and chrome is totally different . It is a defensive war, but they are not on the run. It is all new . It is the war every one wanted to see. If it was to become a TV series . It could have too running story's by using flash backs of the beginning of the war , as they shown a short clip of in this pilot. They could show the original Cylon's robots from Caprica organizing and so on. As Star Trek Deep Space Nine has shown, a series based on a war fighting for there way of life with Superior special effects can last 8 years.
 In short Battlestar Galactica Blood and Chrome is all special effects , a great start to a series and has the potential to last for years. If the big wigs would just open there minds. And not dwell the short run other series and the bottom line.",1361318400,,1231,4.129166666666666

BSG Blood & Chrome would have been a series many of us would have tuned into, especially with television being currently oversaturated with cookie-cut fantasy and paranormal programming.  For far too long, there has been a startling absence of original science fiction programs from the SyFy lineup ( utterly baffling given the great reception from the Star Trek reboot and now the exciting Star Wars Episode VII announcements ).  SyFy has made a serious error in passing this one up.  Perhaps they're hoping their upcoming series Defiance will be enough to satiate it's former viewers who used to religiously tune in to BSG & Caprica, Stargate, Farscape and other sorely-missed, legendary shows.  They might just be placing all of their eggs in one basket, however, and the simple variety that Blood & Chrome might have offered could have restored some of their dignity, not to mention their reputation.

5042334,2,B006ZL2T66,"Bloud & Chrome is ok, worth watching, but not worth money to watch.  The Battlestar universe is just too small to launch multiple series from.

You have humans and you have cylons... that's it, nothing else and with Blood & Chrome being a prequel the ending is already known to be a draw.  the pilot feels like it was done on the cheap and the writing comes across as both tired and uninspired, a real ""collecting a paycheck"" effort.

To boot their  are some very bad ideas in this pilot that succeed only in breaking the immersive experience of watching a film, 1st being the ""video goggles"" used for briefings..... Legend of The Rangers had it's ill conceived 3d weapons control and Blood & Chrome has these stupid goggles, (I've got a 60"" LCD I can loan if needed for briefings) Blood & Chrome also features weapons that don't work until they need to, and yes an almighty shotgun is the only answer on occasion which makes no sense and amounts to nothing more than a cheap writing trick, having Cylons writhe in pain gets the ""stupid decision"" #2 credit.

Blood & Chrome brings nothing new to the table because it can't.

Titanic had this issue, the audience knew the ship was going to sink but the audience didn't know who'd survive, Blood & Chrome lacks even that.

For BSG fans this pilot lacks inspiration, homogenous dialogue delivered with way too much effort mixed in with some real crap make it a less than compelling experience.  For everyone else it's a reminder of why the original series lost 75% of it's viewers before it finished, why Caprica the spinoff failed in it's first season.

I will give a solid thumbs up to the idea that the Colonies weren't doing well despite it's repeated hammering into the viewer but again we know it'll end in a draw so does it really matter?... sort of I guess?",1361232000,8,1812,4.547692307692308

But there is no way that SyFy should be the one to take it forward because like all good shows that they start, they move it around and around until they can say the ratings are not there while pushing stuff no-one really likes amid too much commercials -- how SyFy channel is able to remain in operation is beyond me as I would think the advertisers would abandon a network that cannot maintain consistant viewer loyalties with the quality production they do manage to get occasionally due to their dumb leadership. I guess they call it creative marketing cause that is the only thing they seem good at as they give up any good show even before it can be taken to the next level.

However, this would be a great jump off point to go from series to mini-series which this Galactica franchise seems able to do periodically with flying colors and maybe they would be better off going that route as they advance this particular story line.

It sets up the whole series. In BNC, you are coming into the story after the First Cylon War is in it's tenth year. Why in the world didn't they do the same thing with Blood and Chrome as they did before? It would have made a lot more sense. The story would have had a chance to quickly add more characters, the space battles would have been fantastic and there would have been a chance for better continuity of the overall BSG canon. They could have very quickly tied what Caprica was leading up to, how the Cylons decided to rebel against mankind. It was hinted at in the BSG finale. ""All this has happened before. And all this will happen again."" They should have started with the 1st Cylon War from day one with a young William Adama as a new rookie pilot thrown into battle, not some subplot, limited and boring little covert mission. They should have spent the money to do it up big and spectacular. Instead they tried to do it on the cheap. And if they did as I suggest we'd already be talking about the new BSG Blood and Chrome TV series in production to be shown on SyFy and not some failed false hope, could have been, throw away attempt to recreate the magic and success of the re-imagined BSG series- One of the best TV shows in history.",1360454400,7,1530,4.315972222222222
5042365,5,B006ZL2T66,"I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between the Unrated Cut and the Machinima Webisodes, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).

Note, the Unrated cut runs around 7 minutes longer than the Webisodes, including nearly 4 minutes of credits.  The Unrated cut also includes some extra choice swear words, such as a-hole and s---.  In summary, it's a much tamer unrated cut than unrated BSG DVDs that SyFy has previously released.

(1) When Adama, Coker, and Dr. Kelly first come aboard the Osiris, they are treat hostilely by Commander Ozar's 2nd in command (played by Ty Olsson, formerly Captain Kelly on BSG:RDM) and his Marines.

(2)  Adama sleeps with Dr. Kelly but nothing explicit is shown, minus some shedding of clothes.

(3)  Coker attempts conversation with Toth, who proves to be quite the misanthrope.

I thoroughly enjoyed the prequel and it's a godsdanged motherfrakkin' shame that SyFy decided to sit on it for so long and air quality programming like Ghost Hunters instead.  Luke Pasqualino as the cocky, young Adama and Ben Cotton as the war-weary Coker played off each other nicely, even though there was lessened tension from viewers knowing that Adama obviously survives the First Cylon War.  B&C writers still managed some interesting twists in the storyline.

It was nice being reunited with beautiful CGI shots of starship battles (the Viper/Raider sub-atmospheric battle over Djerba was a visual treat) and Bear McCreary's hauntingly familiar score.  Some of the CGI shots of the Galactica's bridge clearly looked green screened, but not bad considering that the BSG sets had already been torn down at the time of filming B&C.

Frak Caprica.  All you BSG fans out there, pray to the Lords of Kobol for continued life to Blood and Chrome!",1360454400,17,1805,5.071186440677966
5042366,2,B006ZL2T66,"It is the tenth year of the Cylon War. The Colonial Fleet is gradually being worn down by their former slaves turned enemies, the Cylons. Bill Adama, a newly-graduated pilot assigned to the battlestar Galactica, takes part in what should be a simple escort mission but turns into a major operation which could have important ramifications for the entire war.

Blood and Chrome started life as a proposed full spin-off series of the new(er) Battlestar Galactica. The first spin-off, Caprica, had been a failure and was cancelled after one season. Popular opinion has it that the show was too talky, too cerebral and simply too dull, having moved away from the dogfights and political infighting that made the original series so compelling. For this second spin-off, the proposal was to make a balls-to-the-wall action show, a Top Gun in space with Vipers and Cylons. Setting the show during the First Cylon War would also allow the show to resolve some storylines from Caprica - which took place about sixteen years earlier - and foreshadow some of the events of BSG itself (which starts about forty-two years later).

In the event, it never happened. Blood and Chrome - the proposed pilot episode of the spin-off - was not picked up and, unless the imminent DVD/Blu-Ray release sells like gangbusters, will not be in the future. As it stands, it is left behind as a curiosity and, it has to be said, not a particularly compelling one.

Blood and Chrome was not filmed in the traditional manner. With the existing (massive and expensive-to-maintain) Galactica sets all destroyed at the end of filming, the producers were forced to rely on greenscreens and digital scans to reproduce the original sets. In fact, they were able to adjust the sets to reflect the fact that it's forty years earlier, with less-advanced technology available. The same 'bones' of the original structures are there, but the detailing is different. This works quite well, giving the sense that this is the same ship at a different point in its lifespan. The quality of the greenscreen sets is rather variable, with most of them falling into the 'somewhat fake but you don't notice after a while' category. Some of them are pretty good: the CIC set is surprisingly well-done, though the fact that it's quite a dark set helps. On the other hand, scenes on the ice planet and inside the abandoned facility there are blatantly fake. There's also rather too much lens flare going on in the CGI scenes, which gets distracting after a while.

Other CGI is reasonable, though the decision was made to use very fast cuts. This meant both an insane number of CGI shots (this 120-minute TV movie has more than 1,800 shots, compared to 1,488 for the three-and-a-half hour cinematic film The Return of the King) and almost no time to appreciate them. Whilst the original show was guilty of fast-paced cutting at times which made it difficult to follow what was going on, Blood and Chrome takes this to a new level. The confrontation between the Colonial heavy cruiser Osiris and a Cylon basestar should be a tense, epic moment, but instead turns into a confusing melee of badly-cut CGI shots and explosions. Given that Blood and Chrome has resources available to it that Ronald Moore and his team would have killed to have on the original BSG pilot a decade ago, it's a shame to see them wasted in such a fashion.

That leaves the writing and acting to back up the effects and, unfortunately, neither are very accomplished. There's some attempts at characterisation which should be a lot stronger than it is, since the show really only has to focus on Adama, his co-pilot Coker and their civilian passenger Becca for most of its length. Instead it's all a bit half-hearted and actors Luke Pasqualino, Ben Cotton and Lili Bordan seem uninspired by the material, which is cliched and trite. A few attempts to lampshade the macho pilot genre of action films and series fall flat (as the show immediately employs many of those tropes with no sense of irony or intelligence). Later in the movie there is an attempt to discuss the rights and wrongs of the war and its immense bodycount, but it's all rather tepid compared to the issues that the original BSG raised on a regular basis. There's also a cameo appearance by a BSG regular which helps place the TV movie a bit better in the timeline, but even this misfires as it causes confusion with the flashback scenes in the BSG TV movie Razor, which supposedly happens two years after Blood and Chrome.

What we are left with, then, is a confusing morass of explosions, a ton of CGI (some impressive, most not), some cliched writing and indifferent performances, with occasional bursts of effort. What Blood and Chrome does prove, conclusively, is that BSG is at its heart about compelling characters, ethical conflicts and difficult-to-answer questions. Removing the ambiguity in favour of explosions and space dogfights clearly does not work. However, given that in a few years (when technology has improved a bit more) a lot more shows may be made this way, it's certainly worth watching as a hint of the future of TV production.

Of course its top secret, and of course the fate of the war hangs on it, and of course he fracks a beautiful woman. Altho you can watch it bit by bit on line, it'll be far more fun to own the DVD, since the extra scenes often made Battlestar Galactica DVDs far more interesting, and complete. Also producer/developer/writer Ron's video commentary could be used for a college class in creative writing, since he's always revealing more than just dropped scenes and insider banter, but insights into his creative process. As for the film itself, its impressive. The computer graphics are along the line of PROMETHEUS. THe camerawork include a lot of bright lights shining into the lense, for realistic atmosphere, as well as outrageous futuristic technology. From the first moments of a viper battle, thru the latest technology inside the Battlestar, the residue of Battlestars in a battlefield in space, right up to the creepiest cylon creature yet, the film is a visual feast. But I deducted a star because as fun as this movie is, its far more eye candy orienated, than anything from the 2000 Battlestar series. BLOOD AND CHROME is a film with chills and thrills, but lacking the dramatic interplay, and philosophical overtones . This film contained three characters, with a couple of other people giving a few lines. Since no one believes that SYFY will pick up the option to turn this into a series, its hard to tell if ""BLOOD AND CHROME"" might have developed more character orienated scripts during season one. I've watched the film twice now, and BLOOD AND CHROME lacks the sophistication of Battlestar Galactica. Its that simple.",1356220800,93,1791,4.856209150326797

Blood and chrome is a continuation of the legacy.  It's a little rough around the edges and I'll put the blame where it's due; the staff of what used to be called ""The Sci Fi Channel"".  News of Blood and Chrome and a short teaser of the same leaked out, most likely forcing them to allow it to be shown.  It was done with little budget and support from the network but in spite of that they did an outstanding job.  Seeing the actors that had previously played in Galactica playing different roles in this film, knowing they wouldn't make much money off of it, tells me they enjoyed the work they do, and it shows.

**SPOILER ALERT**  For starters Blood & Chrome takes place right smack in the middle of the first Cylon War! It follows a young Ensign Adama as he is assigned to the Battlestar Gallactica. Much to his dismay his first assignment is not as a Viper Pilot but as a Raptor Pilot (I loved the scene where he finds this out, he reminds me of Starbuck.) Anyways, Ensign Adama & his co-pilot are assigned to escort a civilian woman on a simple milk run. However, once out of communication range they are given new secret orders to escort her to a hidden location. They eventually discover a few Battlestars that were presumed missing or destroyed along with their crews plus a few other support ships. Basically there is a whole fleet of hidden ships deep inside Cylon Space. They dock on board a ship & Adama asks to complete the mission in his Raptor much to the disapproval of his co-pilot (He has 2 months of duty left before discharge.) Well I don't want to give away too much but they make it to an ice planet in order to meet up with some marines. You will see some Cylon Evolution on this planet. The Cylons use the planetary base as an experimental lab of sorts. There is some familiar experiments in their early phase, if you've seen BSG Razor you'll know what I'm talking about. Plus there are a few other Organic-Cylon hybrids you'll see with a very open & surprised eye. Needless to say this is a must watch for all BSG fans out there. I pray to the Lords of Kobol that they make a series out of this, there is a lot of potential here. Watch it, ""So Say We All""",1355011200,7,1914,4.258241758241758

Blood & Chrome by no means is as slick as a the reboot. Lots of green screen shots, lots of CGI that doesn't match up to the budget of the SyFy show. All in all, a good start. The story has some holes and some predictable twists along with some others you don't see coming. Luke Pasqualino as Adama seems to settle into things and could develop into a strong lead. Ben Cotton's portrayal of the warworn veteran, Coker, who can't stand his new rookie pilot is probably the strongest of the lot. The side characters are really good as well. Some of the writing is really good. While I won't write them here they are both toward the end of the last web episode, one for each side. They set up the rest of potential series very nicely. They are also pretty poignant in their own right.

All in all a good pilot for a show I would watch week in and week out should it be picked up as a series though I'm not holding my breath. Maybe a web series? It would at least be something.

How did the Cylon revolt begin? how did the republic begin to falter? who were the ancestors of the 12 colonies?-some suggestions for further movies.

They are the only channels showing anything bold or even remotely considered sci-fi. That would be a show called ""Falling Skies"", the single closest thing to sci-fi on American television. Shame.

The actual SYFY channel has completely abandoned all things science fiction. A few years ago MGM was taken over by new management and they immediately decided to cancel the following: SG:A, SG:U, the new SG-1 movie (SG: Revolution), and the new SG:A movie (SGA: Extinction).

As long as this current bunch of skin-jobs is in charge we will never get real sci-fi. Instead we get a steady diet of rediculous monster movies with horrible acting and direction. We get fed one ghost hunting show after another. We're up to 5 of those shows now right? Oh and my personal favorite - wresting. Wrestling? What the fraaaaak? I just cant wait to see steroid injected men all greased up in baby oil throwing eachother around for a buck. Yup. That qualifies as sci-fi now folks.

Unfortunately for us ""real fans"", we will never see a full blown BSG: B&C series. Not while those circle jerkers are in charge...!

  ...............UPDATE (3-20-13).................
I finally got a chance to watch this pilot/movie for the first time and mow im pipping mad! I cant believe America has given up on all things science fiction and let this one go. BSG:B&C is nothing short of spectacular. The story is compelling, with a bit of a callback to G. Baltar of the origanal series. They really know how to perfectly cast the BSG universe with the makers recasting many BSG/Caprica alumni. Us real fans will identify them immediatly. The new faces are top picks as well including the guy playing young (and dumb) Adama.

The picture quality is brutally sharp and crisp on Blu-ray disc. The audio is big and precise, as I expected, especially for those of us with surround sound systems (Definitive Technology 8.2).

The CG effects for Blood & Chrome are only rivaled in the movies! A small gripe for us computer animators - we'll instantly notice the underdeveloped dynamics programing and very quick decay rates on those effects but other than that it's all top grade stuff. I understand that the action-packed nature of the pilot/movie is to give the viewers a glimps of the kind of quality and intensity the show has to offer with following episodes. To bad that's not going to happen.

I will forever be se stunned at how something this amazing will never get off the ground. We have screwed ourselves out of truly brilliant story telling. Again. I was hoping for Bryan Singer's BSG movie to get going but I suspect after he sees this he might give up on it. Blood & Chrome is just that good!",1352592000,838,2785,4.702258726899384
