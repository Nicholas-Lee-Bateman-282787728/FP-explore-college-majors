1976626,5,B00018D3YQ,"WHAT?!  The uncut version?!  And in widescreen?!  With Raquel's commentary and that fantastic AMC documentary?!
The DVD gods have truly delivered.  The only thing left to hope for is the lost reels of ""The Magnificent Ambersons.""
So many ""bad movies"" fail to really live up to their reputations.  This movie delivers.  Originally rated ""X"", it is in excruciatingly poor taste (two words: Mae West), and would be offensive if it weren't oh so very, very terrible.
Twentieth Century Fox actually made and distributed this film, which has since been very difficult to find.  Watch the documentary first, to fully appreciate what you are witnessing.
I have only seen the cut version on the Fox Movie Channel, and even that version has the scene with Raquel strapping on the...well, I'll let you found out that detail for yourself.
Gather your friends around, and enjoy one of the great cinema bombs.  (then hold a candlelight vigil that Fox will release that OTHER X-rated studio classic in their vaults: ""Beyond The Valley of The Dolls"").",1077235200,61,1035,4.976744186046512

1976637,3,B00018D3YQ,"Why give this film 3 stars? MAE WEST!!!! She looks great in it and every scene with her is fun! Actually the film is pretty much trash and confusing with all the vintage movie clips inserted (the director cut out some of West's scenes and put these in instead).  I have to admire Raquel Welch trying her best to play out a role that is pure trash. John Huston is wasted in this film. It's also great to sell a very early Tom Sellect in a short scene - must be one of his first entries into films.  Rex Reed is just horrible with no charisma at all - He looks totally bored in the film (maybe that is the way the director wanted him to portray the character, in which case he is to be commended, but I think not).  I understand most people connected to the film did not like the finished product, and the film is a total insult to the book. If this is supposed to be campy it falls flat on its face. If this is supposed to be funny, there is no comedy here. The extra (interviews with Raquel Welch, etc.) are very informative and explain why this film is a DUD! As I said, I am giving this film 3 stars basically for Mae West (14 minutes of film),  the extras, and a valiant attempt by Raquel Welch in a thankless role.",1473033600,2,1218,4.083682008368201

1976683,4,B00018D3YQ,"Fair warning: the majority of viewers will hate this movie. You may be an exception, however, if, as I do, you enjoy watching bad movies. Not any bad movie. Most bad movies are no fun at all. There is a particular sort of bad movie that is fun to watch. The necessary element for viewing pleasure is camp, which is notoriously hard to define but unmistakable when you see it. Not everyone experiences pleasure in camp  at least not readily, but for those who do, it is hard to do better than Myra Breckenridge.

Vidals novel has something to say, and some of the message crosses over into the movie if you look for it. The gist of the plot: the protagonist, once Myron Breckenridge, thanks to the good surgeons of Copenhagen, becomes Myra. She doesnt reveal her other-gendered past when she takes a teaching position at an acting school in LA. Myra is a Classic Film aficionado who argues that no insignificant movie was made between 1935 and 1945. She asserts that every culture has a mythology from which it derives an identity, and the movies of 1935-45 form the American mythology; the actors of the era are the gods and goddesses of our myths. They define our sense of ethics, our world view, and our ideals of masculinity and femininity. Therein lies the problem. She believes the sex roles embodied in these films were all very well for building a nation and fighting Nazis, but are inappropriate to a world facing overpopulation and nuclear weaponry. She wants to remold our mythology by means of the movies, creating an America and (to the extent Hollywood movies have global reach) a world that is more bisexual and less dominated by traditional masculine bluster. The birthrate thus will fall and pressure will be eased on the nuclear trigger. A school for actors is as good a place to start on this task as any.

The traditional gender types reflective of 35-45 are embodied by two students at the film school who plan to marry. Rusty is handsome, swaggering, and a bit of an ass. His wholesomely pretty and air-headed girlfriend Mary-Ann (Farrah Fawcett) wants nothing more than a white picket fence and four children with Rusty. Myra sets out to remold them by sexually humiliating Rusty and seducing Mary-Ann. Myra considers it a great success when the shattered Rusty shouts he is sick of women. Rusty in turn becomes so hostile to Mary-Ann that she announces, Ill never marry! I hate men! Both are now better able to bring Myras vision to their future screen roles. Bisexuality is a double-edge sword, however, and Myras plans are endangered when she finds herself (the part of her still Myron) falling for Mary-Ann. In a related side-plot, casting agent Mae West reverses the casting couch by exploiting aspiring young male actors.

In many ways Myra is far in advance of its time. The film looks good, too, which counts for something. Though some critics complain about them, I like the use of classic film clips inserted into the movie; they help set the tone and make the point. (*SPOILER* follows.) While Ill in no way argue that this is a misunderstood good movie, my only real personal complaint is the deviation from the ironic ending of the book, in which Mary-Ann marries a surgically re-altered Myron. In the film, treating events as a dream sequence may have simplified bringing the plot to a resolution, but it is altogether too facile to be satisfying.

Despite being fictional, Myra (the literary one anyway) in a sense might have had some success. The marriage and birth rates indeed have fallen since 1970 to all-time lows. Gender roles have lost definition; traditional attitudes sound increasingly quaint when not actually politically incorrect. Come to think of it, maybe omitting the marriage of Myron and Mary-Ann was the correct decision for the movie after all.",1389657600,7,3802,4.798473282442748
1976684,1,B00018D3YQ,"This movie is one of the Legendary Stinkers of all time. Poor Raquel! She didn't want to be in this but she was under contract. She had no choice but decided to make the best of it. She says that initially she thought that she would be playing both Myra and Myron and that the movie would be a challenge. Someone decided that acerbic Film Critic Rex Reed should play Myron. (The title of this review is actually one of Rex's lines of dialog.) What?

There aren't enough plastic surgeons in all of L.A. and N.Y.C. combined to turn Rex Reed into Raquel Welch. There aren't enough Ace bandages in the world to flatten Raquel's chest so that she could dress in men's clothing. Adding to the confusion, Raquel and Rex have a dance number together... at the same time...

The screenwriters didn't seem to get the fact that Myra's film fantasies were just that and most of the flashbacks were happening in her mind. (She was really kind of a mess to look at.)

Everybody is miscast, particularly Mae West. What I don't understand is why Mae came out of retirement for This particular Film? She was wealthy, She owned the half of Los Angeles that didn't already belong to Bob Hope. She had been offerred comeback films before this (including Sunset Boulevard) and had turned them all down. Her character, Letitia Van Allen was supposed to be a predatory talent agent. I imagined a non-singing Ethel Merman (although I'm sure that Merman never would have accepted this role).

Mae insisted on singing the two songs: ""Hard to Handle"" (Otis Reddings' Hit) and ""You've got to taste all the fruit"" (Obvious), even though this made no sense.  Bewigged, painted up, trussed up, propped up and stuffed into (Edith Head, I think) costumes, she might as well be working from the adjoining sound stage as she croaks out her smutty dialog. She looks like the world's oldest whore. She's terrible, but doesn't seem to be aware of it.

See this for Raquel's commentary and so that you'll be able to tell your grandchildrn that you saw it. Wear your Barf Bag.",1383782400,,2036,4.626038781163435

1976696,4,B00018D3YQ,This film is for those who love fantasy and escapism The script and direction are very good and the pacing of the story very fast. It is for those who also have an open mind and are not afraid to try new and different things,1376352000,,224,4.0
1976697,5,B00018D3YQ,"This movie came out in June 1970, immediately after I turned 13. I'd heard of it back then, but then kind of 'forgot' about it over the decades, until 2013. I'm a big Raquel Welch fan, and ironically had seen all of her movies EXCEPT this one until I ordered it from Amazon last month. I was very pleased with the film and all of the 'behind the scenes' bonuses, including comments from the film makers and Raquel herself from the perspective of 30+ years later. Priceless!

I loved the irony that this film was/is considered a 'disaster' when the majority of today's films are just visual/loud all-look-alike messes; the same stupid, re-cycled 'action' picture completely reliant on the same CGI, pyrotechnics, fireballs, glass shattering etc, with any ""storyline"" being there strictly for the next race-against-time scene to justify the aforementioned. This film 'impacted' me by thoroughly entertaining me with something I'd actually NEVER SEEN before! Wow! I think it's a 'must' for any Raquel fan as she totally steals the show. I can't really compare it to any other film as it's in a class by itself, but some elements of the films 'Tommy' and 'The Rocky Horror Show' from several years later (both 1975) are there. The film WAS considered one of the worst ever, and that may have been true back then. Today it doesn't even come close of course. The real treat with this gem is what Raquel (as Myra) says, and the WAY in which she delivers her lines, particularly with West. Then and now, she's a diamond---pure class!",1370390400,9,1525,4.776515151515151

Still sexy as always she commands your attention. The scene you have to see to believe is when she sings You've Got To Taste All The Fruit, and Hard To Handle. Mae West will NEVER be forgotten.",1361145600,,349,4.223880597014926
1976701,3,B00018D3YQ,"What is there to say about ""Myra Breckinridge""? This 1970 20th Century-Fox slapstick comedy farce was based on the 1968 best-selling novel of the same title by Gore Vidal. It starred Raquel Welch as the transsexual Myra, Mae West as Leticia Van Allen, John Huston as Buck Loner, Farrah Fawcett as Mary Ann Pringle, Rex Reed as Myron Breckinridge, and Roger Herren as Rusty Godowsky.

First, let me clear the questions by saying I did not buy this DVD from Amazon.com, but from my local Dollar General for only $4. On my DVD copy it say the film is rated ""R"" although the movie was originally rated ""X"". It is 94 minutes long and comes with a few exclusive bonus features, including the special and theatrical versions of the movie, as well as the AMC ""Back Story"" documentary on the film.

I must also admit that what I heard about this movie prior to my purchase of it, was not good. My grandmother said she remembered seeing it and that it was ""awful"". I also read that the critics called it ""completely unfunny and surely unentertaining"". However, I chose to overlook this all and buy this cult classic.

Overall, the acting is poor. You can surely tell the stress and displeasure with most of the performances. You can also tell that Raquel Welch and Mae West did not like each other. (Hello, Mae refused to be seen in the same frame shot with Raquel... and it shows!) I think this movie is a bit confusing: you don't really know if ""Myra"" is real or if ""Myron"" is real, and that is not funny, it is annoying!

I think the cast for this film was great! Raquel Welch, Mae West, Farrah Fawcett, Rex Reed, and Roger Herren were perfectly cast! But I also think it would've done better with a better-written script and better director.

So, to clear up any confusions, I would not recommend this movie to anyone... unless you are a Raquel Welch fan or a fan of risqu, old-fashioned, cult classic movies. I would, however, recommend that you watch the trailer for this movie on YouTube.com. And if you do watch it, listen closely to the part were it says ""Everything you've heard about 'Myra Breckinridge' is true"". On the back of my DVD case if says that the movie is ""Weird. Wild. Sexy. Strange"", but it never says ""Good"". It also says ""Meet Myra Breckinridge. You'll never forget her!"" Yes, we may never forget that ""he/she"", but I think she will leave the wrong impression on you!

I hope I was helpful in my review... Thanks for reading!!!!",1360972800,2,2444,4.530612244897959
1976702,3,B00018D3YQ,"The story behind the filming of Gore Vidal's novel is by now legendary; the finished film has been savaged by critics since its release in 1970. In truth Michael Sarne's version isn't as bad as all that: the film offers a suggestive view of how gender constructions are constructed in different societies, and how prejudice often inhibits individuals from expressing themselves.  Hence Myra's (Raquel Welch's) desire to take revenge on those members of the patriarchy who oppress her. Sarne's film uses images of the Golden Age of Hollywood to contrast the grimy reality of present-day (i.e. late 60s) America with the dream-factory world portrayed onscreen.  There are some truly bizarre elements: with her fake blonde wig and reedy voice, Mae West resembles a hellish version of Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950). Rex Reed's acting is perfunctory, while John Huston delivers his lines with tongue firmly planted in cheek. Nonetheless the film is still worth attention,",1360972800,,992,5.272151898734177
1976703,5,B00018D3YQ,"When I first saw this movie in 1970, I was shocked and confused about the plot (if one can call it that) as well as almost everything else about it. In all fairness, I was only seventeen at the time. ""Myra Breckinridge"" is a 1970s sex farce, and its age shows. Still, I found it more enetertaining now than when first-seen in 1970; I understood the inside jokes and the jabs at every single sex topic under the sun. In a nutshell, the story, which was written by none other than the celebrated and (serious) writer Gore Vidal concerns Myron, a young man who undergoes a sex-change operation and ends up looking like Raquel Welch (!) then goes on a quest to find a good-for-nothing uncle who runs an acting school in California. Along the way, Myra/Myron breaks every convention known to man...The one question that keeps coming up is, of course, how did they ever get John Huston, the famed director of such classiscs as ""The Maltese Falcon"" and others, to appear in this pastiche? Raquel Welch looks like she's having a good time; Mae West looks like something out of Madame Tussaud's come back to life and poor Rex Reed looks plain uncomfortable in his few scenes as Myron...One of the best things about this DVD is the ""Special Features"" section. In it Racquel talks in detail of her feud with ""La West"" which is almost as amusing as the film itself. ""Myra Breckinridge"" is not for the faint-hearted; there is enough offending material in it to upset just about everyone.

1976722,3,B00018D3YQ,"The review title tells it all. Besides giving us a rare chance to see the Diva at 73 looking 37 and delivering the only grounded performance in the whole film, her ""old-time"" persona is the perfect counterbalance to the out of control 1970, where sexual *ambiguity* is suddenly the new means to sell soap.

This is not a good film; not completely bad: other pictures of the era like ""I Love YOu, Alice B. Toklas"", ""Skidoo"", Pretty Maids All In A Row"" are in the same genre - that kaleidoscopic new approach. Where effect is more important than cause.

Movie critic Rex Reed does a decent job and John Huston, yes John Huston, does a *great* job. He's ""Uncle Buck"", a washed up Cowboy star running a watered down acting school (which discourages graduation because that's too...confining).

Raquel Welch is Myra, Huston's adversary, and she takes it way over the top, exaggerating every syllable. She's after his money and also manages to take over his classes, employing zero theatrical experience. Raquel herself is so mechanical in this role, I'm not convinced her part was not dubbed!
Other out of sync add-ons involve the alive and well Red Scare and a satrirical look at the Healthcare industry.

To add to the confusion, we get countless, spruced up clips from Hollywood musicals; and from another act from Mae West's heydey, Laurel and Hardy: clips from one of their worst films, ""Great Guns"", are used. Apparently these *traditional* images are used to show the marked contrast with the new hippie Hollywood.

Myron wants to have a sex change operation and he's waiting in the operation room for his doctor. Right before he does the surgery he councils Myron not to have the surgery but Myron sticks to his guns. That's when Raquel Welch enters the picture as Myra Brecknridge.

Her acting was just as good; however, it was a shame that they waste such great talent in a movie like this.

1976728,5,B00018D3YQ,"I wonder how many people so quick to call this the desecration of a great novel actually read the book. As film adaptations of novels go, it's actually quite faithful to the material (except for its abstruse, cop-out non-ending, and the omission of a catfight between Myra and Letitia). Trashy movie? Okay, but so was the book.

Since the whole point of the book was to satirize sleazy, depraved 1960s Hollywood, cheerfully devoid of ethics or morals, where even low-budget ""B"" movies of yesteryear could attain cultural status as camp (""During the years 1935 to 1945, no unimportant film was made in Hollywood,"" Myra instructs), what choice did the film version have--made by the self-same sleazy, depraved 1960s Hollywood, mind you--but to be exactly what this movie is?

It's sad to find out what a painful experience filming was for the cast, because they're all wonderfully effective within the helter-skelter framework. (It seems only John Huston understood the material enough to have had fun with it.) Raquel Welch at least seems to be having a ball as Myra. Of course it's absurd for 73-year-old Mae West to believe she was the star (and demand top billing) and to be given two--count 'em, two--songs to do, but who else could have delivered the line ""Get your resumes out"" quite like that? Tom Selleck and Farrah Fawcett, their TV stardom ahead of them, are both breathtakingly lovely. The inspired use of old film clips to comment on the action (a device stolen by the 1980s cable sitcom ""Dream On"") lifts the film to something perilously close to art.

It's a great movie to watch with friends and drinks on New Year's Eve (more fun than paper hats and getting trashed among strangers). At the very least, ""Myra"" is a class act compared to today's show-biz parodies.",1197158400,8,1778,4.842105263157895

Based on the novel by Gore Vidal about a man who has or wants a sex change operation and becomes a woman. A very beautiful woman (Raquel Welch). The film also features Mae West, John Huston, and early appearances by a very young Farrah Fawcett and Tom Selleck.

The most controversial scene at the time was the 'rape' of Roger Herron by Myra (Raquel) with a strap on - interspersed with scenes from early B+W movies. These clips appear throughout the movie and are creatively handled.

The DVD comes with two versions the 'theatrical release' and 'directors cut' which are hardly different at all and commentaries by Raquel (self depracating and funny) and Director Mike Sarne.

Fits under the category of ""BAD MOVIES WE LOVE""",1173052800,2,811,4.690140845070423
1976734,4,B00018D3YQ,"Gore Vidal's hilariously funny satiric novel was more or less transferred to the silver screen with a good deal of the story intact, but thanks to the hopeless mess made of the screenplay by the director, Michael Sarne, none of it makes a great deal of sense.  Still, the film has lots going for it.  I believe it was unmercifully and unfairly savaged by the critics as much for its revolutionary queer message as for its failures as a narrative.  Myra is not only a transsexual (Myra was filmed only a few years after the world's first sex-change operations made headlines) but her self-proclaimed mission is to ""realign the sexes"" by turning macho heterosexual boys into homosexuals - her way of saving the world from over-population.  No wonder the critics ran from the theatres, covering their crotches as they fled!  Myra is shrewd, witty, beautiful, talented, intelligent AND she is a woman who used to be a man - in short, she was everything that queer / transgender people were NOT supposed to be in 1970.  I happen to think that Raquel Welch gave the comic performance of her (early) career in this movie.  Sarne had the presence of mind to insert old film clips as a running commentary on the plot (signifying Myra's obsession with classic films) and that portion of his vision was sheer genius.  The film clips work just fine, providing many of the laughs.  Each time a perfectly innocent film clip was used as a commentary to the high jinks in this movie, it usually yielded an extremely funny but admittedly tasteless moment.  For instance, then President Richard Nixon reportedly had the studio delete a clip showing Shirley Temple milking a goat and getting sprayed in the face with milk.  What's so bad about that?  Well, it's inserted in a scene where Myron is having a masturbatory fantasy that Myra is performing fellatio on him (in the movie, Myron frequently substitutes for or has conversations with Myra - to remind us that they are the same person).  But so what?  The tasteless sexual jokes are half the fun, and they are generally a little classier than say, Pink Flamingos.

Gore Vidal reportedly sued to have his name removed from the credits, but a good deal of his dialogue and lots of his satire is still intact.  Despite all the bad things you can say about this picture, I felt that the spirit of Vidal's book runs through every frame.  Farrah Fawcett is young enough to be practically unrecognizable, and the young manly hunk who plays Rusty (what ever happened to Roger Herren, anyway?) is dreamy enough to justify sitting through this curiosity.  Myra / Myron is such a queer revolutionary that the film seems way before its time, and in some ways, still does.  A 77 year-old Mae West had lost none of her famous timing, but the director reportedly cut about 20 minutes of her scenes.  I recall reading a rumor at the time that Sarne was incensed when he overheard a studio boss's remark that Fox was banking on Mae West's name to bring in the audience, and who the hell ever heard of Michael Sarne anyway?  I vividly recall a television reviewer remarking that Mae West had the only really funny lines in the picture, and that it was worth seeing for her appearance alone (she reportedly wrote her own portion of the screenplay).  Her quip to the cowboy after he answers her question, ""How tall are you without your horse?"" is not only the funniest moment in the whole film, it's classic Mae at her best.  The reported feud between Mae West and Raquel Welch made interesting items in the gossip columns of 1970, with Welch accusing West of making her own mini-movie within a movie (which is exactly what she did) and Mae retorting, ""Rachel?  She's a sweet thing - she has a scene or two in my picture, I believe"".  Mae got top billing, despite Raquel playing the lead character, which couldn't have made Raquel very happy, I'm sure.

Some of the cameos are funny in themselves just for their casting  -Myron's surgeon is played by John Carradine, who counsels Myron, ""Are you sure you wouldn't like circumcision?  It'd be cheaper..."" and Mae West's first conquest in the picture is a practically pubescent Tom Selleck.  She plays an actor's agent - for men only - who auditions all of her clients on the four-poster bed in her office.  Mae and Tom trade a few very funny lines - she dismisses him from her office / boudoir with the comment, ""You've impressed me immensely - I'll keep you in mind as a summer replacement.  NEXT!""  I was a 16 year-old gay man when this movie opened, and I not only appreciated her conquest, I envied her attitude.

And Rex Reed, a leading film critic of the sixties and seventies, proved (as Myron) that no matter what kind of critic you are, it doesn't mean you can act.  As far as I know, he never did another picture, unless you count his one line, two-second cameo in Superman: The Movie, eight years later.  Myra Breckinridge is pure camp - wait until you see Raquel decked out as Marlene Dietrich, or Mae West singing Otis Redding's HARD TO HANDLE, flanked by a chorus line of handsome African American studs in tuxedos.  Why is a talent agent singing in a nightclub?  Who cares - trust me, it's pure camp.  John Huston as Uncle Buck is absolutely perfect casting, and if you bother to spend a few hours reading the novel before you screen the film, the movie will make much more sense and be far more enjoyable.  The scene where Myra rapes Rusty in the infirmary was, in the novel, one of the most erotic passages I have ever read in a non-pornographic novel.  I loved this movie when it came out - despite its shortcomings - and I love it all the more on DVD.",1161907200,40,5636,4.5858283433133735
1976735,3,B00018D3YQ,"My experience with watching this film was that Mae West, who I have always adored, and wished I could have met, looked SO much healthier and vital in this film than in her final movie Sextette! It was just mean spirited that the powers that be in movies exploited one of the greatest stars of all time, who clearly was not up to making that film, when she stood near the tan body builders she looked pale as a ghost. People could have done the right thing and not released that awful film, but human beings have incredibly capacity for greed. Anyway back to the Myra movie, and Mae truly looked excellent in this one. She had tons of energy, and her comic timing was as perfect as her films from decades ago. Unfortunately the film although very ultra high camp is such a waste of Mae, and the other stars. This movie even had the great John Houston, and he too had some incredibly embarrassing lines to say. It was fun to see the young and incredibly squeaky clean Farrah Fawcett, and also a very very young Tom Selleck,who camped it up with Mae West. If you are a Mae West fan and you are looking for a movie where she makes grand entrances, and she definitely still had that star power, rent or buy this film, and you will forgive the stupidity of the majority of the film. Raquel Welch has some wonderful outfits in here, but I'm sure today she would prefer to forget this celluloid mistake. There are definitely some memorable Mae West lines in here. There will never be another one like her, she was amazing!!!! I guess this movie in its time was quite shocking, but today it is very tame, and one wonders what West wanted with this stupid movie. I almost completely forgot that this is based on the book by Gore Vidal, who too must have put his head in the sand when this appeared in the theatres, or at least retreat to his villa in Italy.",1159833600,6,1847,4.341040462427745
1976736,3,B00018D3YQ,"""I am Myra Breckinridge whom no man will ever possess..."" So began our literary introduction to one of the most remarkable characters ever invented. Gore Vidal's dark and twisted tale of a Hollywood-inspired beauty and her plan to upset the patriarchy, realign the sexes and restore the balance of power was spiritual nourishment of divine order to the sexual revolution of the late nineteen-sixties. Vidal's Myra revealed her personal thoughts and wry observations about society and sex in such an intimate manner on the page that she was soon inside the reader's head and taking us on the wildest of rides.

In the late sixties when news of the filming began, fans of the book wondered how such an outrageous story would translate to film. Foremost in people's minds was the lengthy and very graphic scene of Myra's sexual exploration and rape of a handsome young man.

The advance publicity for Myra the film heralded a glamorous Hollywood treatment with pop casting of the highest and somewhat surreal order. Raquel Welch, the leading sex symbol of the day would portray Myra.  The ever provocative Mae West, the goddess of sex herself was signed to play Leticia Van Allen, a talent agent for men and Myra's newfound buddy. Oddly, real life film critic Rex Reed would portray [...] film critic Myron. Filming was troubled; the main problem was director Mike Sarne. Vidal has suggested that the director of a film is almost unnecessary when everyone else does their job, and one can imagine Myra a far better film had Sarne been fired and the actors and cameraman carried on without him.

For the uninitiated this film can only be confusing and hard to follow. Entire chunks of the script were not filmed, or left on the cutting room floor leaving the viewer to guess what happened. If there is real pleasure to be gained from watching this film it may be best enjoyed after reading Vidal's book so you might imagine what the film should contain, or considering the script by David Giler, who loved Vidal's original work and provided everything needed to make Myra Breckinridge a unique film classic. In the 1972 book, The Screenwriter Looks at the Screenwriter by William Froug, screenwriter David Giler revealed a great deal about the dynamics behind the filming of Myra.

The double sided DVD present two versions of the film a ""Special Edition"" and a ""Theatrical Version."" Accompanying the ""Special Edition"" is a commentary by Michael Sarne, which proves (as Vidal himself said) that Sarne was the very worst possible choice as director for this film. Sarne is so full of himself and so full of nonsense that is next to impossible to listen to the full commentary. He repeatedly expresses his contempt for the material and the actors. Sarne attempts to take credit for the use of film clips interspersing the film but David Giler said they were in the script before Sarne got his hands on it. The two ""editions"" are almost identical; one difference being the film clips that replaced the notorious use of a clip of Shirley Temple (being squirted in the face while milking a goat in ""Heidi"") inserted into a gratuitous scene of fellatio. In one version we now see a canon go off, in the other a champagne bottle erupts. The only other difference is the last scene in the ""Special Edition"" is now in black and white with Sarne going to some length to explain his ""artistic"" reason for this.

Raquel Welch obviously took her role very seriously; her interpretation of Myra is earnest and impassioned. Considering Sarne's inept direction what Welch manages to get across here is a tribute to her talent. Theodora VanRunkle's fabulous costumes convey a great deal of style and contribute to some of the most sublime images of Raquel Welch on film. Welch's commentary on the DVD is interesting; it would have been good to hear more on her interpretation of the role. Her scenes with John Huston are very sharp and conjure the spirit of the book.

Mae West holds her own as Leticia Van Allen, though it would have been amazing to see her play the character as written. West looks beautiful at 76 years old, its unfortunate that she and Welch didn't get along. In the book their characters' friendship helps carry the plot. One wonders what happened to the scene between them at Leticia's beach house. Production stills from it survive, as does a witty line by Mae, included on one of the trailers. It would have been satisfying for film buffs to see these deleted scenes or other outtakes as extras on this DVD.

There is an interesting documentary included, Backstory: Myra Breckinridge. In many ways this half-hour film is better than the feature.

Apparently Mike Nichols was initially discussed as director, with Anne Bancroft as Myra. That would certainly have yielded a very different result from what we have here. Although Hollywood rarely if ever attempts to remake a flop and try for a success it would be very interesting to see this story re-filmed by someone sensitive to the original and unique message of Vidal.",1148774400,13,5026,4.821345707656612
1976737,4,B00018D3YQ,"You probably need to be in the right mood to appreciate this film. It's truly unique. Sometimes you will laugh at it, but most of the time you'll laugh with it. It has a kind of bizarre, cynical humour that I can't help but love.

The cast is wonderful. John Huston and Mae West are both fantastic. John Carradine and Tom Selleck have one scene parts, and Farrah Fawcett and unknown Roger Herren are also good. But Raquel Welch is the real star, and she does a surprisingly great job. She really carries this movie. She is hilarious, and delivers every bizarre line of dialogue perfectly.

After having seen this only on a badly pan and scanned VHS, the DVD is a real treasure. There's a short documentary and two commentary tracks, one by director Michael Sarne, and one with Raquel Welch. She doesn't seem very well prepared and there's nobody there to ask her any questions, so at times she just sits quietly, but it's fun anyway. Almost feels like you're watching the movie with her, listening to her occasional comments about herself, the movie or Mae West and telling anecdotes.

1976739,1,B00018D3YQ,"It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a shambling, preoccupied air of sensitivity could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossally misguided effort, was able to get the job. Sarne was one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been on acid to agree to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless and painfully twee actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing traffic in a supermarket aisle never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. If the film looks horribly amateurish, that's because it is.

If there is an historical marker indicating the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein: the debasement of culture. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.

Many reviewers have spoken about the intercutting of footage from other, older (and better) films. Some actually liked these clunky ""comments"" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them pointless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself, any intrusion would have to be considered a welcome relief.

In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was not a subversive and avant guard sensibility, but a paucity of invention, the clips were inserted in a last-ditch effort to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so artistically-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were virtually nonexistent, and screenwriter David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat in a corner of the set and `thought' for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the studio brass, the producers, and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brimming skull of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each fashioned from the dozens of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye, Baby, bye-bye.

As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters and poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the Lilliputian abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality, and just plain competency when compared to even the cheesiest of them. The film was doomed the day he was hired, and a very funny and original book by Gore Vidal became the jerky, manic, and supremely unfunny (except when it wasn't trying to be) Myra Breckinridge, The Meltdown.",1134777600,11,3900,4.895612708018154

1976743,3,B00018D3YQ,"Director Michael Sarne probably considered himself a maverick filmmaker gleefully taking H-wood sleaze into the 1970's, but his style and his humor are resolutely old-fashioned. He works hard at being naughty, but the film seems a far cry from the X-rating it originally received! This adaptation of Gore Vidal's celebrated novel(a pretty close match, by the way)does 'mod' better than most '60's comedies. ""Myra"" looks like a piece of candy, full of Jell-O reds and greens, creamy pastels and black-and-white Theodora Van Runkle costumes. It falters by letting Mae West strut her stuff unrestrained(her sex-crazed talent agent is now also a pop singer!)and her jokes(reportedly self-written)are smirky but not hilarious. Raquel Welch is surprisingly good as the half-crazed Myra B. (she's always on the verge of belting somebody, and you can sense her desperation and tension). Despite the picture's colorful production, there's an an obvious lack of cohesion behind the scenes, and the camera is almost never where it should be. For every gorgeous shot--like one of Farrah Fawcett smiling with Klieg lights firing up in the background--there's a mess of visual non sequiturs that leave the viewer rudderless.

This is a very difficult movie to watch. I had to watch it over an expanded period of time, because it is so very badly written, executed, acted, and delivered.

Rex Reed plays Myron Breckinridge who has a sex change operation and becomes Rachel Welch?! John Huston stumbles around; May West exacerbates her embarrassing self parody; Farrah Fawcett performs in a film that could have ended her career before it began; Tom Selleck too; but it is the film that embarrasses itself the most.

Gore Vidal's expose on what he thought would be changing sexual mores of the 1960's turns out to be less prophetic than nonsensical.

There's no cohesion to the film. Explosions and battle scenes are intercut into straight dialogue, not unlike some episodes of ""Love American Style"" from the 1960's and '70's.

Vidal is said to have been appalled at the film, but Michael Sarne has said that it was Vidal and Reed who set out to sabotage the film from the start.

In the end, it is we, the viewing public, who suffer. This is because we are the ones who've been subjected to this horror.

Don't bother about the hype of this film. It was all Hollywood whitewash for a repugnant and worthless film.

one can only imagine whether the real film is on the cutting room floor....",1117670400,5,1468,4.70703125
1976746,4,B00018D3YQ,"I watched this DVD and was surprised at how good it was. Now, let's be realistic. It is not the best movie in the world. It has flaws and every bad thing other critics have written is accurate.

If Raquel Welch had not been cast in this movie, the thing would have fallen into oblivion as soon as it was released. Nobody, not even the most fanatical fan would buy this DVD to watch Mae West. She is not good at all. Okay, okay, she sucks, what can I say? You cut her scenes out of the film, make a few additions and nobody would ever worry about her contribution or lack of it to this epic.

Raquel is irreplaceable. She is brilliant, carries the movie to its bitter (and oh, so sad) ending and is a major force. She offers an inspired performance and will remain unforgettable.

Oh, and a tantalizing tibdit for the lecherous ones: this movie was shot in the pre-DVD era. At that time nobody had envision the possibility of zoom. So what? Nothing, except the directors and censors and people of strong moral capacity, did not cover things or care about exposed parts of the human body. It is possible to explore Ms. Welch's anatomy in detail should you be so wicked. Not that you will see much of anything because she was careful. However what you can see is wonderful if it fills your screen. The same goes for Ms. Fawcet who does an excellent acting job by the way.

All in all, I liked the movie and had a lot of fun watching it.",1112313600,5,1433,4.276752767527675
1976747,2,B00018D3YQ,"From someone who read the novel first, the movie didn't shock me as much as it has some of the other reviewers. The overuse of indecent language was to be expected from a story so full of sexual innuendo. Raquel Welch, who is so stunningly gorgeous for a transsexual in this film, and Mae West tried so very hard to save the movie. The scene in which the two share dialogue is confusing though, partly because the camera never spans so that you can see both women on the screen. The intense close-ups on the two women make it seem as though they were shot separately. Despite being mildly entertained by film's portrayal of Hollywood in the 1960s, Mae West's musical number was one of the two things that kept me going through the entire film, other than the random implanting of classic film scenes throughout that would jar me from my blank staring. &#61514; This movie might be considered great for those who enjoy the loathsome films of that era, but for me, it just didn't do anything. Well, ok. It did do one thing. It made me laugh. But I wasn't laughing with the film, I was laughing at it. ;)",1109808000,2,1101,4.428571428571429
1976748,3,B00018D3YQ,"Seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions.  Now at last on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package, it will be of interest to film historians, movie buffs, and cult film fans--but it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released.

Gore Vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement on American hypocrisy, Hollywood fantasies, and changing sexual mores.  Most filmmakers felt that the novel's story, structure, and overall tone would not translate to film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen.  But studio executives soon had cold feet: Vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer-director Michael Sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen.

Studio executives hoped that Sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film, but Sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves.  Rewrite upon rewrite followed.  The cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative.  In her commentary, star Raquel Welch says that she seldom had any idea of what Myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself, and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film.  In the accompanying ""Back Story"" documentary, Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls.

The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself, which contains a host of good ideas that work individually but never consolidate into anything that approaches a cohesive film.  The basics of Vidal's story are there, but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications, it seems to have no point in and of itself.  Everything runs off in multiple directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had.  And while director Sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce, the only laughs generated are accidental.

Chief among these accidents is Mae West.  It is clear from Sarne's commentary that he idolized West; in her own commentary Welch flatly states that West had carte blanche to do what she wished, be it write her own lines or demand the inclusion of  two musical numbers or not work before five in the afternoon.  It is true that West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one-liner--but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling, to say the least.  But worse, really, is the fact that West is outside her era.  Her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self-characatures ever seen on film.

The remaining cast is largely wasted. Raquel Welch, a significantly underestimated actress, plays the title role of Myra very much like a Barbie doll on steroids; non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the entire role is essentially without point.  Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper, and Andy Devine emerge relatively unscathed.  Yes, it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be: fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, relentlessly unfunny from start to finish.  It is true that director Sarne does have the occasional inspired idea--as in his use of film clips of everyone from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create counterpoint to the action--but by and large, whenever Sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong choice.

The how and why of that is made clear in Sarne's audio commentary.  Sarne did not like the novel or, for that matter, the subject matter in general.  He did not want to write the screenplay, but he needed the money; he emphatically did not want to direct the film, but he need the money.  He makes it very clear that he disliked author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he flatly states that Reed ""is not a nice person""), and to this day he considers that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their  'homosexual agenda'--which, when you come right down to it, seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually film Vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take-off on it.

Although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community, Sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people.  When taken in tandem with the film itself, Sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic--and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project.

In addition to the Sarne and Welch commentaries and the making-of documentary, the DVD includes several trailers and two versions of the film: a ""theatrical release"" version and a ""restored"" version.  The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the ""restored"" version has been printed to black and white.  The edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored, but the documentary details what they were.  The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine.  But to end where I began, this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians, movie buffs, and cult movie fans.  I give it three out of five stars for their sake alone, but everyone else should pass it by.

1976751,2,B00018D3YQ,"This 1970 movie, based (?) on the novel of the same name by Gore Vidal defies description. First, this film appears to have little in common with Vidal's novel, as I remember it. I notice on the DVD case that Mr. Vidal ""denounced"" the film. Why wouldn't he? The movie is basically plotless. It would have needed a stellar cast to pull this off, but it stars the aging Mae West, Raquel Welch, the film critic Rex Reed and the director John Huston, along with Tom Selleck and Farrah Fawcett, not exactly great actors. Michael Sarne gets credit or the blame for directing and being 1/2 of the writing team responsible for happens here.

There are certainly some funny moments here and indeed the movie may become a cult classic. Mae West plays herself, as do most of the other actors. And she can be mildly funny in a crude Mae West way. If this movie is about sexual identity-- and I haven't the vaguest notion if it is or not, although Rex Reed/Myron may have a sex-change or, according to the director's commentary, dreams he has one-- then surely the irony is not lost on anyone that Ms. West, by the time she made this movie, was the least real ""woman"" of any of the various and sundry bisexuals, post-op transexuals, whatever, and must be as artificial as any other ""woman"" in this travesty. Surely  nobody believes she looked like that at the end of her work day.

Twentieth Century Fox posts a disclaimer at the beginning of this DVD about the opinions expressed in the commentary that go along with this movie. Both the director and Ms. Welch give their comments although I only watched Mr. Sarne's. He liked Ms. West and Mr. Huston but has most unkind things to say about Ms. Welch, Mr. Reed and particularly Mr. Vidal 30 years after he dropped this bomb on us. Mr. Sarne rambles on and on about what the movie is all about and what we are to glean from it, what he is trying to do, etc., etc. I must admit that most of his lessons sailed right over my head. Example: he says he only photographs Ms. West wearing white and black-- not exactly a true statement but who cares? -- because she heretofore had only made black and white movies. Okay! Then he enlightens us on the difference between the British use of ""camp"" and the U. S. version of ""campy."" I suspect this director is homophobic-- check out the mincing, lisping African American student--although Mr. Sarne is so ineffectual that it's difficult to care much.

Vidal's novel is quite funny and certainly worth reading. I'm not sure a successful movie could ever be made from it. The late John Schlesinger had both the talent and sensivity to have brought this novel to the screen if anyone could have. But he didn't so we are left with this. So pop in this DVD, grab your chocolates, skip the director's commentary, and laugh loudly for all the wrong reasons.",1105142400,3,2827,4.515625
1976752,1,B00018D3YQ,"I remember watching ""Myra"" when it first appeared and could barely sit through it. Most of the audience I watched it with in New York City got up and left. We all knew we had just paid good money to watch one of the most inept, God-Awful messes to ever come from a major studio. You cringe as you watch the mummified remains of Mae West totter around as if she's a wooden mannequin. Those horrendous one-liners she personally wrote herself make you wince. The very worst? A tall, handsome man says he needs to see her. Mae asks: ""How tall are you?"" He answers: ""Six feet and seven inches."" She tries to roll her eyes, and pat that plastic-looking blonde wig when she croaks: ""Forget the six feet. Let's discuss the seven inches."" Hearty har! Har! Raquel Welch is just as pitiful. She utters every line in this fluting, sing-song cadence without a drop of reality. The take-off on gays is nauseating. The black queen who minces and flutters his eyes is so repulsive you wonder what world he came from. Maybe parody was the theme.

Indeed, it has been a difficult movie to find anywhere.
I was thrilled when it came on DVD just recently.
When I first watched it, I was sort of disappointed. I expected more. What? I don't know. So I had to give it a chance. After viewing it once, I then watched it with Raquel's commentary, and then with the Director's commentary.
Raquel gave a great performance, as did John Huston (Buck Loner)
and Mae West (Letitia Van Allen) was quite attractive in this film. This was her first color film ever, and after a long hiatus from the silver screen.
There was alot of anymosity on this set, and I fault the Director Michael Sarne for this. If he hadn't been so full of himself, this might have worked better. I don't know who's in control of the script, or changes in the script, but this constant rewriting of the story didn't make matters better for the actors.
I think the acting is top rate, and the actors deserve credit for taking lemons and making them into lemonade.
I wrote to Raquel Welch recently to tell her alot of this and more, and I mean what I say.
And maybe she's right.
 In the commentary I believe she wished that John Huston had been the director. I agree with her on this. Someone who might have cared about people would have made this difficult and abstract story a success on film.",1080086400,9,1372,4.3803921568627455

8007860,5,B00018D3YQ,"That film critics mostly hated Myra Breckinridge when it was released says more about their inability to crawl outside a staid and rigid 1950s mental framework than it does about any flaws in the movie itself.  Certainly much of the criticism was on the basis of  purported ""indecency"" (eg Time Magazine, that bastion of Lucian conservatism). Myra was no doubt ahead of its time, but not by that much - 1970 after all was beyond the Summer of Love.  Of course, the critics largely belonged to an older generation (but then so did Mae West, and she brilliantly played a major role in the film with great gusto). Gore Vidal's own negative reaction to the movie version of his novel (which was itself condemned as pornography before becoming a best seller) stemmed, I suspect, from an author's understandable desire to see a film with the same name as his book be essentially the same - and of course, film versions of novels often are quite unlike the books they're based on.  As for the movie, it brilliantly uses that most iconic form of American Kulture - Hollywood - as a tool to bludgeon American Kulture in all its other manifestations - from stagnant and hypocritical sexual mores to a perverted legal system.  The steady stream of campy humor with which all this criticism is delivered should make anyone (except maybe a corpse) cry with laughter.  The cinematography is wonderfully imaginative.  I wonder if the film had come out twenty years later what the ""official"" reaction would have been.  Whatever.
