8211270,3,B000TXP53K,"My son who is 8, wanted to watch it, since he is a gymnast. And I was excited to find a movie about men's gymnastics. However, I would NOT recommend this for younger audiences. Assuming this is based on true actions back-in-the-day, how horrible those young boys endured such behavior from a coaches/parents. As an adult it was informative about the history of other countries and gymnastics. But, I would have rather not watched it with my 8 year old son. We both learned from it, and I had a lot of explaining to do.",1483401600,,518,4.463157894736842
8211271,5,B000TXP53K,A great drama movie. If you are thinking about showing it to you children I would strongly recommend to watch it alone first to decide is it appropriate or not.,1414022400,,160,4.366666666666666
8211272,4,B000TXP53K,"If you love gymnastics, you must watch this movie. You'll understand why some trainers are like they are. I recommend it.",1390608000,,121,4.809523809523809
8211273,1,B000TXP53K,I purchased this in hopes of showing it to some gymnasts. The story is difficult to watch and has too many bad words to show to any child. Very disappointed.,1389312000,,157,4.266666666666667

I love it!",1282608000,,68,4.666666666666667
8211276,5,B000TXP53K,"I consider this film to be a masterpiece that cuts to the core of what happens to athletes from the old eastern european block.  The bleakness of of their childhood, gyms that are unsanitary and coaches that are borderline sadistic, public housing that is as depressing as any low income public housing in the US.

Young talent is brainwashed, often abused and their physical limits are tested to the core.  What happens to a person who is raised in such environment?  What is their parents never learn or wanted to learn about the methods used by their children's coaches in creating champions?  And what is such champion to do once their (competitive) career is over?

Main character of this movie is a gymnastic protege Dongo.  He is a good kid, physically and verbally abused by his coach, used as a prop by his parents.  After fall of the government sponsored sports gyms, he finds his way to Canada hoping to teach young kids.  But he is not cut out for that.  Even when he means good, his actions are of kind he learned from his own experiences.  And when such actions collide with Western culture and mentality does this young man has a second chance?

One does not have to be gymnastics fan to like this movie.  But if one is, then the scenes of practice and competition is pure bonus.  The actor in the main role of Dongo (Zoltan Miklos Hajdu) is director's brother who is a professional gymnast.  That fact alone gives this film a whole new dimension.

Rimsky-Korsakov's musical score used in this film is greatly appropriate and it adds power to the story.",1250380800,2,1568,4.606498194945848
