Romantic encounter, sloppy roommate, cougar coworker, self observed boss, celebrating life during funeral, proposal, pregnancy, abortion struggle, pro-life protesters, abusive or not dad, crazy or not mom, father-aunt  hookup...

8549079,3,B00AADAJ44,"This is not a review of this sweet little film which I clearly loved enough to shell out money for, though it is a good watch, in case you didn't already know. This is a review of the item sold here, the DVD of Driving By Braille released by Green Apple.

When I first ordered this, I received a damaged copy and, initially believed it to be due to the disc coming loose or damage sustained during shipping, because the item was open box and scratched with a cracked case. I did a return and got a replacement, basically, immediately, and it was identical in flaws, something that, truly, never happens.

I couldn't conceive of how this could occur and proceeded to order the cheapest used copy I could find and then call the friend who alerted me to the fact that this film had been released on nearly two years ago and, somehow, I hadn't noticed. In consulting with her I was surprised to discover, from her story of her search for this film, that the data side of these discs are very often scratched, from poor production standards and packing issues, that is to say, they are damaged at the source, not during shipping. When she bought hers, she got several loose in package and scratched up, just like the two I received, but also got ones in cracked cases and two of three were open box. She then got one that was not loose and was just scratched up in exactly the same place as the loose ones only so very much more scratched than the loose ones.

I remembered, in talking with her, that discs don't just magically appear in a case to be shipped to our homes. DVDs are processed through layers of equipment and then placed in cases by people who don't always check for damage to the data side before placing the disc inside the case as they are looking for print errors on the picture side. As such, a friend received three scratched up discs and I got two, so far, out of five ordered from three different vendors, and they were scratched in the same places from what appears to have been equipment malfunction, not from having been loose in the package, as not all of them were loose.

So, it turns out, sadly, that this release seems to be packaged in very cheap, easily cracked/broken cases with very poor quality control in inspecting the discs. This DVD release sometimes comes without shrinkwrap, which makes it appear used when it is, in fact, new and has probably not even been opened to check for damage. And, worst of all, it is often so scratched, all around the innermost centimeter to inch of the DVD data side (readable side), that it won't even play correctly on older equipment. These appear almost as though the discs have been fed through a disc cleaning device from the mid-1990s (that we all know not to use anymore), and there is no clear explanation as to how this happened but it is a manufacturing error you should look out for.

To be clear on playback, neither of the discs I received would play because my player is, quite frankly, not that good, but when tested on a Blu-ray player, they would play, one with minimal skipping and one with more skipping. My friend reported to me that her first discs were like that but the last one, according to her, the worst scratched of all, plays perfectly on her DVD player, Blu-ray player and computer so the scratching may not be the source of the playback errors.

I wanted to post this so that you would know, if you get this in the mail from any seller, you should test it first before concluding it is a bad copy due to scratching and before deciding to return it due to it appearing damaged, as this DVD release was not prepared as professionally as I think all of us are used to at this point. It is not Amazon or the seller's fault if there are scratches around the center and so, if you are lucky enough to get one that plays well, you should hold onto that copy, and remember how many copies just two of us have encountered with problems due to manufacturing errors. For future readers, she purchased in late 2014 through early 2015. I purchased for the first time in April 2015 and will update this when I find a copy that plays.

Again, this is one of those rare times when you should test a so-horribly-scratched-I-don't-even-want-to-look-at-it type of disc, even though it looks terrible and used, before you consider returning it for damage as you may have one of the only playable copies being produced right now.. Amazon has no control over the product this vendor sends out to them so a playable copy, new or used, is a real find on this film, at least right now. Just call it a diamond in the rough, the little DVD that could, and be thankful.

UPDATE:

I've received my third copy of this and, once again, it is scratched all to you know where. It won't play without freezing on my DVD and Blu-ray players. It played last night on a friend's player though so I just gave this last copy to him and am, of course, returning the first two. Disappointing (due to whatever manufacturing error caused this) but I have now ordered one from that site we all go to, hoping the feds aren't watching. Looking forward to my illegitimate copy which I can watch whenever I want. It is a lovely film.",1429142400,5,5182,4.434873949579832
