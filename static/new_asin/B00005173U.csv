1386788,5,B00005173U,"This video is fun to watch,But you should see Ultimate street Brawls at streetbrawls.com. Whether or not you are trying to learn tricks, since it also contains skateboarding humor and the culture of boarder life. It's a great video for beginners, and it will still be useful once you master the basics. It also teaches more advanced tricks that will provide a challenge for quite a long time, since, as Hawk himself says, it takes years to master them",1004832000,2,451,4.7215189873417724
1386789,5,B00005173U,This video is possibly the most useful video for beginning skaters that has ever been made.  If you are a beginning skater buy this DVD.,996710400,,136,4.44
1386790,5,B00005173U,"ok,  Heres my review about tony hawks trick tips video. First ,I got into skateboarding not to long ago. At first I really sucked at it,and I gave up on it. Then about a week later my friend gave me a few tip on 360 shoveit,heelflip,and kickflip. I already knewhow to do a ollie and nollie. The other day my grampa bought me a monegoose skateboard and Im learning fast. Im still practiceing on the shove it,heelflip,and kickflip. I hope Tony will get this letter.who ever reads this,give it to Tony to read.  your friend,  KYLE CARSON",995328000,3,534,4.484536082474227

1386792,5,B00005173U,"The best video I've seen. It teaches you how to do many tricks in great detail, also in goofy and regular footing.  It's aimes at beginning skaters, but more advanced ones could use it too.  It teaches you how to set up your board, how to push, turn, and do tricks like the ollie, the 180 ollie, a pop shuvit, kickflips, and heelflips.  He teaches you about ramps--pumping, kickturning,dropping in, and a rock and roll fakie.  He teaches you rail tricks and ledge tricks like the lipslide, frontside boardslide, 5-0 grind and many more. I would recommend this site to all skaters.",985219200,26,580,4.6568627450980395
1386793,5,B00005173U,very good dvd to teach you the basics. i loved it i learned how to improve all the tricks i already knew how to do. thanks tony!,985046400,,128,3.7777777777777777
1386794,4,B00005173U,"This video is a good overview of the basic moves.  Tony and Kris show both goofy and regular, which is nice.  Its humorous as well.  the only problem with the video is that it doesn't cover all that much material.  Other than that an excellent video for the beginner.",978134400,10,267,4.387755102040816
1386795,4,B00005173U,"With skateboarding influencing smaller kids with Playstation's video games and ESPN's X-Games...kids can only need help. For instance, I can remember struggling to perform an olly and finally learning with help. This tape as I viewed it really showed how to do each trick and helped strengthen my friend's performance moves. If you need help with the board buy it.",975110400,58,364,5.083333333333333
1386796,3,B00005173U,Though the movie does show step by step how a trick is done its nothing like jsut doing out and practicing yourself. It does not let you know that skateboarding is much about your own style and how YOU compelete a trick. Don't waste the money...just go ask a friend how its done and learn it your own way.,1059350400,2,305,4.186440677966102
1386797,4,B00005173U,"Basically, they show tricks being done slowly and give advice on how to do them correctly.  This can be very helpful or totally useless depending on how you use it.  It is something that you only watch a couple times and then never watch again.",1056758400,7,244,4.4
1386798,5,B00005173U,"This is a great video. When I got this video I could do it all easily. Even a double kickflip. But this video will raise the self-esteem of a beginner after they had watched it. If you are looking for a video on how to learn the basics(kickflip, ollie, heelflip, boardslide, shuv it, 180 ollie)this is the video for you.",1032912000,3,320,4.35
1386799,5,B00005173U,"this is a great video to learn to skate. It shows you how to, ollie ,180 ollie,pop shoveites,kickflips,and heelflips. Next to the mini ramps it tells u how to drop in and rock to fakie.
I am a ten year old boy who can do all these tricks but heelflips.",1026000000,3,252,4.06
1386800,5,B00005173U,"Tony Hawks Trick Tips video starts out by showing you safety equipment and selection. The videos orderly  and  starts out by showing you how to ollie (that's the basic trick you need for a lot of tricks) and then goes on to more advanced tricks.  Tony keeps it an interesting and relaxed video by adding some humor after they teach you a couple of tricks, and using pro skateboarders to show you how they do it. The humor helps keep the viewer entertained, but not that you'd be bored anyways with Hawks easygoing and detailed way of teaching the tricks. It'll help you relax so you can learn the tricks better. The videos good, and not weird shaky camera, cheap sound, ect.(if Tony Hawks going to be in it, I don't think it would!) And all in all a fun instructional video. It may sound like I'm a huge fan of Tony Hawks, but I'm not , I just want to learn skate and the video was great compared to a lot of others I'd seen. And I'm impressed with the way Tony, (and the film crew)did the video, real fun! BUY IT! don't get conspiracy weird  on me, I'm not a marketer, I'm a seventeen year old girl, that likes to learn to skateboard from the best!",1020729600,2,1149,4.256880733944954
1386801,5,B00005173U,"This video is the best skateboard video I've ever seen! I bought this video about 2 months ago and I'm starting to get  good at skateboarding. First on the video Tony Hawk shows you the board set up at the Boardroom skateshop in California. He also tells you what size and shape boards,trucks,wheels,and bearings are right for beginners. Next , Tony Hawk and Kris Markovich show you how to push,balance,and turn. Next,they show you how to  do ollies,180 ollies,pop shove-its,kickflips,and heelflips. The good things they show you in these tricks are in goofy and regular footed and what you should be doing and what you shouldn't be doing and the most common mistakes. Next,they take you to mini ramp skating. They show you how to pump, kickturn,drop in,and rock to fakie. next, Tony and Brian Sumner show the boardslide. And that's about it. I would recomend you buy this video if you want to learn how to skate cause Tony,Kris,and Brian have sure showed me how to skate.",1012694400,25,972,4.779761904761905
1386802,5,B00005173U,"I bought this DVD for my son. He said this DVD was great...he's 14 years old, alot of his friends skateboard so he decided he would learn but having his friends teach him just wasn't cutting it. He now has alot of the basics down and is starting to learn tricks. This is great for the beginner.",1009756800,,294,4.175438596491228
1386803,4,B00005173U,"its a really good starters video i think the transworld starting point one was just as good if not better. they talked through things that will mess u up and other hints like that. tricks like the kickflip, heelflip, shuv-its FS and BS, flat ground 180s BS and FS, and how to Ollie. then on mini ramp/vert had rock to fakie, drop-in, pumping,and kickturns. that part was tony and kris markovish. then on rails the BS boardslide with tony and brian sumner. also board setup,pushing and other stuff like that pretty ill intro to sumner does a kickflip BS 5-0 on a rail and kris does a double kickflip... and mess-ups at the very end ull laugh at.",1008460800,4,644,4.466101694915254
1386804,5,B00005173U,"This video looks very good. I am definitely getting it. I'm not too good at skateboarding. I think something like this would encourage me to keep on trying, even when I look like an idiot. I think I'll be able to learn from it as well. You should get this too!",1005782400,,260,4.117647058823529
7929264,5,B00005173U,"It's 2016 and I imagine most people learn who don't have a friend or parent to teach them learn about skateboarding from youtube nowadays. This video is great, though. Starts with how to pick a skateboard, how to identify your forward foot, how to push and turn and ollie, kick flip, and more. It starts very basic and soon grows very advanced. It will take most people a year or more of good practice to master what is discussed in this video.",1451692800,,444,4.426829268292683

7929266,1,B00005173U,"The methods, approach and tips are ok with Tony Hawks Trick Tips.  BUT purchase Skateboarding Explained if you really want to see Best Trick Tips,  Best Explanations, Best Breakdown of Foot and Body positions, Best Successful Approach to each trick.  Skateboarding Explained (SE) also is useful longer because it goes from beginning all the way through more accomplished skateboarding.  I have used both products while helping teach others and everyone of my camp students, hands down vote for SE.",1196035200,2,497,5.253164556962025
7929267,3,B00005173U,"Tony Hawk--A great innovator and skateboarding would NOT be where it is today without him...However we could have done without his instructional video.

It was a bit unclear and was less than inspiring.

If you are looking for a instructional skateboarding video i HIGHLY reccommend Skateboarding Explained. You can buy it on Amazon too! Check it out!

It is a step by step video that gives endless possibilities and gives you lots of new ways to invent new tricks.

7929269,4,B00005173U,My son is 6 years old and new to skateboarding.  The skateboard scene can be a little mature for that age.  I previewed the DVD when it arrived and I founf nothing offensive.  Tony Hawk does a good job describing the hows and whys of the sport.  The only conflicting message was that some of the other boarders did not wear protective gear.  That is the only fault I can find with the DVD.,1180656000,2,389,4.202702702702703
7929270,5,B00005173U,"I got this about a week ago on barnesandnoble.com. It just arrived today. I also borrowed my friend's skate video with Andy  Macdonald in it and it was short and did not teach you the tricks that well (I mean that if you ask someone else who knows how to do it, they will say that Andy only said a little part of how to do the trick). His is the average skating video and the stough it teaches are as follows: Ollie, Kickflip, Shuv-it, Heelflip, boardslide, and to always wear a helmet. The video also only took about 30 sec. on each trick. Now, the stough Tony Hawk's trick tips vol. 1 skate boarding basics teaches you are as follows: boards, wheels, trucks ,bearings, safety equipment, pushing, turning, ollies, 180 ollies, shove-its, kickflips, heelflips, pumping on mini-ramps, kickturns, dropping in on mini ramps, rock to fakies, boardslides, lipslides, 50-50 grinds, noseslides, tailslides, 5-0 grinds, nosegrinds, and finally, crooked grinds. Tony also takes about 1-2 min. explaining each trick. What I am trying to say is this video teaches you way better than the competition. I highly recomend it.",1105920000,17,1110,4.873015873015873
7929271,5,B00005173U,"This is an excellent video for beginners (and parents of beginners!). My son is just getting started, after having watched Tony Hawk for many years and playing video games.
