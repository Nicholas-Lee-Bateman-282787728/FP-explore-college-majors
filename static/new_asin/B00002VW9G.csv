There's lots of love triangles, quadrangles, octoganals or whatever! Fast-paced, despite the hilarity of the show, it still manages to tug my heart strings at times and it even made me cry once. As wild as it is, there is a real story behind all the comedy, one that reaches through the screen to the reader. Highly recommended.",1004054400,,496,4.712643678160919

The Nadesico ends up finding the Crocus, one of the ships sucked into a Chulip on earth. The admiral of the Nadesico goes aboard the Crocus and orders for the Nadesico to go through the Chulip or he will fire at the Nadesico. Just then, the Jovians attack. The Nadesico embarks inside the Chulip while the admiral goes down with the Crocus. The Nadesico arrives on the other end of the Chulip which is right near the earth which is also in the middle of a battle. While Akito, Yurika and Inez are sleeping together in the recreation center, Ruri wakes Yurika up and the Nadesico wins the battle. It took the Chulip 8 months to transport the Nadesico to the other end, so a lot has happened. The Nadesico now agrees to help defend the earth for awhile. The Nadesico docks on the ship known as the Cosmos and recieve a new pilot, Akatski. The five pilots head out to fight the Jovians again and Akito gets lost in space. Yurika and Megumi goes after him, but end up being stuck with Akito lost again. Fortunetely, the Nadesico interveins. This volume was very fast and exciting. The love between Yurika to Akito, Megumi to Akito, Inez to Akito, Jun to Yurika is just too funny. This volume also explains a little more about Akito's past. Its just too good. You have to see this show!",979344000,,1420,4.4653846153846155

7916348,5,B00002VW9G,This was a very good contiuation from vol. 2.  The beginning was wonderful once the story plot started.  The Unaltered Japanese dialogue was essential to promoting the Storyline in it's full glory.  In my book this is one of  the best videos in the Nadesico series and I hope to have many more like  them,961804800,,304,4.454545454545454
