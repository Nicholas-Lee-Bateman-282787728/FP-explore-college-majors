8367127,5,B002EAYECO,I love silent movies. In 1920's William Haines was a major MGM film star. He had a style all his own. It is worth your time to check him out for yourself. I have some 10 films in my collection. Enjoy them all. This was the era when Hollywood was truly the film center of the world. The films were silent so they could be viewed around the globe. Since 1924 MGM was the studio for quality productions and had the stars to prove it. An era that is gone forever. Yet we have the movies of that forgotten time to view and judge for ourselves.,1433289600,3,538,4.084905660377358
8367128,5,B002EAYECO,"Absolutely brilliant piece of film making from silent era.  This was the first film I had ever seen starring William Haines.  I caught it just by chance one evening on TCM and wondered why I had never heard of this actor before.  It turned out Haines was top five box office from 1926-1931 and with good reason.  He could act with incredible skill and ease in front of the camera portraying brashness, comedy, pathos or whatever was needed on the turn of a dime.  Only contemporary actor I can think to compare William Haines with is possibly Johnny Dep, and that's saying something.",1432771200,3,583,4.621359223300971
8367129,5,B002EAYECO,"This is another great William Haines movie with any funny scenes. Specially those in the store and parking scene on the front of the store.

The DVD is (for not restored/remastered) in very very good condition.!!! Also the new score from 2007 is nice composed and very enjoyable (not like those old organ sounds).

Hope Warner Archive brings more William Haines movie out (so far they're survived!).",1276992000,5,399,4.940298507462686
