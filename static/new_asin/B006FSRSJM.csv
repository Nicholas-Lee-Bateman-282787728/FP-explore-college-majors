8497168,3,B006FSRSJM,"The Mortician (Method Man) is a lonely man with a scarred past, the kind of guy who keeps his mind occupied by throwing everything he is into his work. That all changes one night on the way home from work, when he witnesses a crime eerily similar to the one that made him the way he is. The Mortician is content to try to ignore what he saw, until he comes to realize it directly involves the young man he is mentoring and that inaction could destroy another family. This film was a bit of a surprise to me, in that it wasn't the horror film I was expecting. The preview made this film seem like it was horror, as do the title and cover art, not to mention it's on Lionsgate, which has become synonymous with B-movie horror in recent years. Perhaps the even bigger surprise was the star of the film, Method Man. Every single time I have seen him in a film, he's playing some thug or gang banger, so I figured that he was just another one of these rappers that Hollywood uses when they need to fill that type of role, but I was wrong. Despite the ridiculousness of a man who is nearly fifty years old still calling himself, Method Man, he can legitimately act. In fact, this film is quite dark and slow moving, even boring at times, but Method Man and the unique traits of his character, were the most interesting aspect of this film. Maybe I'm rating the film a bit higher than I should be, then again, my expectations were extremely low. The Mortician isn't a horror film and it doesn't move at a quick enough pace to even be labeled a thriller. The story is a decent one, albeit one that takes forever to get going, and the acting is much better than I would have expect from this cast. The Mortician wouldn't be my first choice by any means, but if you have the opportunity, I wouldn't skip it either.",1488844800,,1804,4.277777777777778

8497170,5,B006FSRSJM,"I knew nothing about ""Method Man"", except that he was a member of the Woo-Tang Clan,  and played the bad guy in ""Sandler's"" movie, ""The Cobbler"".  Watching this movie dozens of times,  he got my curiosity when Sandler took his character, and gave Method Man's character a ""human side"".  Through IMDB, I was able to find some of his other works, including this movie.
  Most impressed with his diversified, and less gangster role.

  Good job, Method Man.

8497171,3,B006FSRSJM,Movie was decent.  Not as terrible as some other people said. I just enjoyed seeing Method Man playing a character that wasn't a thug,1454371200,,133,4.541666666666667

8497173,2,B006FSRSJM,"I feel like this movie could have been better. I don't think it's supposed to be modern day or it takes place in a different noir reality. The movie never really builds until the end. That was just a few scenes. What could have been the interesting parts of the story, the boy and his mother, weren't shown. Method Man's acting wasn't the greatest but it wasn't bad. I just feel like if the story was told better it might have been a better movie.",1426896000,,447,4.270588235294118
8497174,5,B006FSRSJM,"The Mortician is a lonely solitary man who works for the county processing bodies for burial in a decaying city riddled with crime like a cancer sucking away its life blood. Until one day he gets a woman in who has tattooed on her Bottacelli's ""Birth or Venus,"" and gets a new porter named Noah who works there as part of his parole. Soon he discovers a boy named Kane sneaking into his mortuary and memories stir in him about his past, about his mother who was a prostitute, and learns the woman brought in is Kane's mother and that her killer was also his father a ruthless drug dealer who'll kill his own son to keep from going to prison. Now the mortician is in a race against time to give Kane something he never had when he lost his mother closure. A great independant film and Method Man does a great job.",1348704000,,812,4.279220779220779
8497175,5,B006FSRSJM,"A friend recommended 'The Mortician' to me after he had seen it himself. He wanted to find out what I thought about this movie, as he was so impressed by it.
I was open minded and decided to give it a shot. I was not familiar with the director Gareth Maxwell Roberts' work nor that familiar with Method Man. Well, what can I say? I absolutely loved the 'feel' of this movie.  It sucked me in quite quickly as not only are the visuals gorgeous, but the soundtrack is fantastic.  As the story slowly, yet precisely unfolded I found myself deeply involved in the well defined characters and the story that was being told. Even though our characters are set amongst a harsh brutal backdrop their plight is extremely heart felt dealing with grief, loneliness, confusion, and survival. There is a lot of love in this story, and I found myself identifying with so much of it and even tearing up in many places. The subtlety in the dialogue is not only clever but poetic, thus allowing me to just 'absorb' instead of being 'pushed' in to having the emotions that I did. This is also credited to the actors who portrayed their characters (with what little dialogue they had) with such deep honesty and clarity that is a testament to their skills. I found The Mortician' to be a unique piece of cinema. It is a far cry from the millions of cookie cutter films that are churned out every year that are so predictable and leave me feeling empty. As the credits rolled at the end of this film I heard myself say ""Wow"" out loud, and I felt the urge to watch it again. I have to say this movie 'The Mortician' got me! And has become one of my favorites. It is a solid, extremely creative and seriously well made film that is brave and so different from the norm.
I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see something unique.",1332288000,5,1814,4.395833333333333
8497176,2,B006FSRSJM,"The Mortician (Method Man) is a shy dysfunctional man. His social life consists of a prostitute he visits for off screen sex. He speaks as little as possible. He has a second job/hobby as a taxidermist. In spite of what seems as two incomes, he lives in a run down place where he walks to work past buildings that look like they are in a war zone. I don't think the name of the city is mentioned. I suspect Memphis as he travels to Almaville, Tn.

Our Mortician has flashbacks to his youth which intensify when they bring in a dead woman with an elaborate tattoo of Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus, a painting which hung in his home as a child.

Meanwhile he has a ""porter"" (E.J. Bonilla) who is on parole and acts like a thug. There is a young boy who has witnessed a murder and is a person of interest to the killer.

The film goes on with very little action until one scene...and then it is about over. The movie was dull. The small boy's life is supposed to mirror the mortician's life as a child. That was not enough to make for an entertaining movie. The editing was poor.

N-word, F-bomb, brief sex, no nudity. Deals with prostitution.",1330128000,2,1145,4.336448598130841
