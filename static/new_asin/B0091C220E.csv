5241066,5,B0091C220E,"I can still remember as a kid watching Perry Como with the family, having him be a large part of out Holiday Spirit.  This Special has some of my most poignant memories of Perry Como and it's a down right pleasure to finally get the chance to share this with my kids and grand kids. My parents will be revived with life after getting this for their Christmas season. A MUST BUY!",1352246400,17,378,4.25
5241067,5,B0091C220E,This DVD is a compilation of all the best moments from the Perry Como Christmas specials that were shot all over the world in the late 70's and early 80's!  It is chock full of celebrity guest appearances which are great.  But the best part is seeing Perry singing all of your favorite Christmas Classics like only he can do!,1352246400,7,325,4.4
5241068,5,B0091C220E,This is a must Perry Como Christmas DVD. One of the best Christmas shows that I own. I give it a 5 star rating.,1412812800,,111,3.6666666666666665

5241071,5,B0091C220E,"I was so happy to see this release. I first saw it from my local library but loved it so much I decided to buy a copy. It has 5 or 6 of his annual Christmas specials, each with their own special guests joining him (for example, the Williamsburg special had John Wayne as a guest). Also visited are Mexico, Vienna, Paris, and Israel. Of course there were several of his renditions of ""Ave Maria"" as well. I definitely recommend this one.",1390176000,3,436,4.329268292682927
5241072,3,B0091C220E,"It was beautiful, but christmas in Ireland is still my favirite. They don,t have specials for Christmas on Tv anymore. Which is probably a good thing. I can,t imagine Perry having people doing half the things they do today and call it entertainment",1388793600,,248,4.790697674418604
5241073,5,B0091C220E,It is good to know that I can find such entertainment of years past.  I was a great fan of Perry Como!,1388620800,,102,3.6363636363636362

5241075,3,B0091C220E,I think Christmas isn't Christmas without Mr. C. I like this DVD. Be advised that it is not HD quality - sound is just Ok and the picture quality varies. I have better quality on my old VHS tapes. But it is a nicely edited cross-section of some of his later specials . I don't mind the editing and as far as the same songs - well those are worth repeating.,1387411200,,356,4.028169014084507
5241076,1,B0091C220E,"Perry Como Is Magnificent but this DVD is only highlights from various shows
so provides just small portions of specials in the late 1970s and 1980s. More
satisfying is the MPI DVD release of the entire ""Perry Como's Christmas Show""
from 1974 with The Carpenters. You get the whole classic program plus lots
of bonus material. Hopefully more complete Como TV presentations will be
issued in full format and better quality but this Christmas Around The World
compilation is just an appetizer.",1386028800,2,491,5.0
5241077,5,B0091C220E,"This is everything we hoped it would be and more, one of the greatest Christmas collections out there.  My family has traveled to Quebec, Williamsburg, Paris, Mexico and Salzburg, Austria, many times, and are very happy to see these places as backdrop to one of the great singers and a great collection of traditional Christmas songs, including many religious songs which remind us of the true meaning of Christmas.  I am sure we will watch it many times.",1385510400,4,455,4.82051282051282
5241078,5,B0091C220E,"This was a great Christmas show performed in many different countries  around the world by Perry Como.  Loved seeing the different Christmas traditions and hearing Perry's voice again!  He had some great guests on performing with him, great choirs

5241081,5,B0091C220E,"When someone spoke of a classy person, one always thought of Perry Como in this vein.  He was a very understated man and singer whose soft-spoken style and grace made you want to make sure you didn't miss any of his TV appearances and specials ... and this Christmas special(s) is one of 'em.  He was a crooner in the best sense of that description, and one always remembered that he could laugh at himself as he did many times during his TV shows and specials.  G-d doesn't make 'em like Perry Como anymore or else the world would be a better - and more musically melodious - place!",1369353600,7,583,4.330275229357798

5241084,5,B0091C220E,Very enjoyable review of the great television shows of Perry Como.  The San  Antonio show should have been included in the package.,1361232000,,131,4.909090909090909
5241085,5,B0091C220E,i grew up hearing and watching perry como and his christmas shows every year were a real tv special hit.,1360454400,,104,4.25

5241087,3,B0091C220E,"I only gave the Perry Como Chirsitmas special three stars because I felt there was nothing exciting about it.  I think this videos would appeal more to the older generation.  Also, some of the songs were repeated, but in a different country.  I liked the Andy Williams Christmas special much, much more.  It's more lively.",1359590400,,322,4.8
5241088,5,B0091C220E,We loved watching this movie at Christmas time.  Our dad (who passed away) loved Perry Como.  It will become a family tradition  from now on every Christmas to watch this movie!,1358640000,,177,4.645161290322581

5241090,5,B0091C220E,"This DVD captures moments from a few of Perry's Christmas specials of the 1970's and 1980's.  These specials were always a very classy affair, produced with what are known today as ""high production values.""  While we get some different performances of the same songs, this is not a problem; there is nothing unpleasant about hearing/seeing Perry's moving, stunningly beautiful rendition of Franz Schubert's Ave Maria more than once.  My only wish is that Perry's estate would release each of these specials intact, as they were originally broadcast.  I'm sure there is a market for them that would justify the expense of tracking down approvals of his guest stars.  If for no other reason, these should be made available to allow future generations to know that there was actually a time when gentle, reverent beauty was possible in the entertainment world.",1358380800,15,857,5.0928571428571425
5241091,5,B0091C220E,"For so many years Perry Como's TV specials were a must show to watch druing the Christmas season. His themed specials took us around the world to view the most fantastic sights in the universe.  This is a very entertaining DVD and a must for everyone to own. If you're from the younger generation, you should experience what our Christmas TV specials used to be like.",1358035200,2,367,4.5606060606060606
5241092,5,B0091C220E,"This video is a good compilation year's of memories watching Perry Como's Christmas specials. As a kid, I remember looking forward to his specials every Christmas. Even though the video quality is not the best I still enjoyed watching it.",1357776000,,238,4.975
5241093,5,B0091C220E,"The Perry Como Christmas specials were always eagerly anticipated, and this compilation of excerpts from some of his shows done internationally is a wonderful reminder of those much-missed programs.  The only thing better would be to have these specials released in their entirety.",1357603200,,281,5.534883720930233
5241094,5,B0091C220E,We had this on VHS and were thrilled when it came out on DVD.  This and other Perry Como DVDs have been a Christmas Tradition in our home since he was on TV.  Wonderful!,1357430400,,169,3.9411764705882355
5241095,5,B0091C220E,"For those who recall Perry's weekly TV show of the 50's and his superb shows during Christmas week, this will bring back many wonderful memories. He sings all of the songs/hymns that we loved: Oh, Holy Night, Ave Maria (by both composers), Silent Night, Panis Angelicus, etc. His voice is in fine form, and as always, he is warm and genuine in relating to the audience. The setting is not in a studio but at sites such as Colonial Williamsburg, Austria, The Holy Land, Paris, Canada and Mexico. He is accompanied by stars such as John Wayne, Debbie Boone, Angie Dickinson, and performers including the Vienna Boys' Choir and Ballet Folklorico. This video will become an essential part of your celebration of the Christmas season and will remind all who view it of the unique talent that was Perry Como, one of our national treasures!",1357430400,6,833,4.751724137931035
5241096,4,B0091C220E,Perry Como had that special voice and this video proves just reinforces that belief. This Video of Perry's Christmas songs brought back a reminder of Christmas in the 1960's.,1357344000,,174,5.0344827586206895

Service was prompt and professional and we really enjoyed watching this on ChristmasEve!  I remember growing up and watching variety shows as my parents never missed any, and PerryComo was certainly one of my favorites.  Best version of 'O Holy Night' ever.  The price is right and this is a must for a true Christmas experience.",1357344000,2,419,5.0144927536231885

5241100,5,B0091C220E,One of the greatest advantages of being of a certain age is to remember Perry Como. His rendition of songs especially Ave Marie is unforgettable. The holiday spirit of past is relived when you play this dvd,1357171200,,206,4.594594594594595
5241101,5,B0091C220E,"Memories are sometimes all we have as we age.  My wife and I watched Perry Como Christmas Around The World as tears of joy ran down our face.  This DVD will now become a Christmas Tradition.

Buy it and enjoy.",1357171200,,209,4.175

5241103,5,B0091C220E,"It was wonderful seeing all the longtime stars and most of all seeing Perry at the Sacre Coure in  Paris and even more moving, hearing him sing my favorite Christmas song, ""It is he Christ who is born today"". He even had the same comment I had when I first looked up from the stairs where also stood and said ""This is as close to heaven as you can get"". That is just how I felt too.",1356652800,2,382,3.961038961038961

5241106,5,B0091C220E,I already had this on VHS and love it so much I wanted to get it on DVD.  I grew up watching Perry Como with my mom and love watching these holiday specials.,1356566400,,157,3.757575757575758

5241108,4,B0091C220E,"Skip this and get The Perry Como Christmas Show https://www.amazon.com/Perry-Comos-Christmas-Show-Como/dp/B00EMLRKFG As for this DVD, as noted by another reviewer, the video and audio quality are not what they should be. This dvd would have benefited tremendously if the company had taken advantage of imaging technology to actually upgrade the image quality to HD. As it is, some of the scenes look almost as though they were taped off of a television screen as opposed to using the original tapes. With the economical processing power and computer imaging capability available today, there is really no reason for a studio to release a product with picture quality that is this bad. For example, distance shots are so distorted you cannot make out Mr Como's face let alone his features and there is considerable video distortion when any of the subjects are moving. Additionally, the audio could have been cleaned up and balanced across the different segments. Also, as noted by another person, becaused this consists of different specials that have been cobbled together some of the songs are repeated. One thing viewers can do to improve the viewing experience is to set your HDTV from a 16:9 to 4:3 aspect ratio. This will not eliminate the image problems mentioned above but will reduce their effect. Hopefully someone will get the message and produce a full HD quality release of this dvd. Compared to the video and audio quality of other dvd releases of old television programmes (e.g., A Ford Show Family Christmas - also available on Amazon), this one is poor indeed.",1356393600,16,1577,5.069230769230769
5241109,5,B0091C220E,"Although not like the traditional Christmas special with dancing,singing and fake snow. This trip around the world with Perry Como shows other Christmas traditions backed with beautiful scenery and the still beautiful voice of Perry Como. A must for anyone who grew up watching the Holiday specials of Crosby,Williams and Hope.",1356220800,,327,5.431372549019608
5241110,1,B0091C220E,I ordered this DVD because of the great reviews it received on Amazon but I was really disappointed when I watched it. The picture quality and sound quality are poor. The musical selections are repeated often as Perry moves from one country to another. How many times do you want to hear the same song? Many of the shows were poorly written and the producer made numerous blunders. It is very obvious that most of the scenes were filmed in the summer or fall. If it was in a bin at K-Mart for $4.99 I would tell you to buy it but it is not worth the asking price. Save your money.,1354665600,19,580,4.1875
5241111,5,B0091C220E,I am so thankful to have grown up in the years of Christmas television specials.  Perry Como has the most calming soothing voice and sings songs of Christmas with such meaning. This DVD is a real treasure and I.m thankful to have it in my collection!,1354665600,,250,4.434782608695652
