8441833,4,B004UMG3HI,"While the blu ray versions are far from blu ray quality, they are vastly superior to their std versions which are blurred and less than appealing. the content itself is fabulous and these really keep the boredom at bay for the duration of my workout. I love these as they don't direct you to what rpm or pulse rate you should be at, thats up to you. the music is good on some and worse on others i find my ipod works the best for me. Since no one else offers anything like this with out the annoying instructor I'd say these are the best available. I own like 9 of these this title is one of my favorites. I'd give it 5 stars if it were up to blu ray standards.",1387411200,,661,4.015151515151516
8441834,2,B004UMG3HI,"The actual movie isn't too bad.
Music is okay.
The disk itself is very cheap and looks like it was manufactured in someone's house and the label printed on a cheap ink jet printer.
I have serious reservations about how long it will last.",1370563200,,237,4.409090909090909
8441835,5,B004UMG3HI,I got the original twenty-two videos a couple years ago from the Bike-O-Vision website and then found out they came out with many new videos and bluray too. My husband and I do a lot of RV travel and I've been up and down the California Coast many times but never by bike. But when we're at home the Bike-O-Vision videos are perfect to give us the same feeling as being out on the open road. I highly recommend these videos for indoor cycling.,1343347200,,443,4.285714285714286
