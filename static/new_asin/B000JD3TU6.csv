8150008,4,B000JD3TU6,"I bought this to go a long with a Christmas theme for my nephews. I have had a habbit of buying them gifts with a theme such as ""knights"" etc. Last year I decided the coast guard should be the theme, largely because I got an excellent fisher price coast guard boat for the younger one, and a Tonka Coast Guard Helocopter for the older one. The coast guard is also often overlooked for kids. Fireman, and policemen they know....but really I can think of no more heroic example in our culture then these, and seldom is there ANYTHING on them for kids to see.  I was a little concerned that the last story might be a little shocking to the younger nephew as it tells a very sad story fo the sacrifice the brave men and women constantly risk. However it proved to be maybe the most important part in instilling in them a respect for these true ""heros"" and what they risk for people on a regular basis.

I would say this is a great video for anyone interested in the Coast Guard, from age 8 and up!

Video is great quality, and the stories are interesting at any age. ""Semper Paratus""",1261180800,,1079,4.279411764705882
