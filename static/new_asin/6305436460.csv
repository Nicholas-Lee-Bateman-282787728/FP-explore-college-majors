7890473,4,6305436460,"These movies are issued by a myriad of companies.  I only have this set so I can't comment on the comparative quality.  I can state that I am satisfied with the quality of this Roan set.  That is, the images are mostly crisp and there wasn't much hiss.  The price is a plus also.

I Liked ""Time of Your Life"" best.  It has a good quirky cast and plot.  The acting is also first rate.  It has a certain stage play feel to it.

""Blood On The Sun"" is a more than adequate suspense yarn.

""Something to Sing About"" is a fun movie.  Its kind of a comedy-musical-drama.  Nothing too serious.",1094428800,19,585,4.171171171171171
