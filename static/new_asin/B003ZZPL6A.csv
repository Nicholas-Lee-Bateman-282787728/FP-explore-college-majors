8411430,4,B003ZZPL6A,"Here in Vermont, we had an opportunity to be part of FDR's park-to-park system.  The Green Mountain Parkway was designed at about the same time as was the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Laurie Davidson Cox, the chief resident landscape architect for the National Park Service, did an exemplary job meeting many objections to the original Vermont parkway plan, which would have been more of a skyline drive approach.  Cox moved it off the summits onto the flanks and into the valleys.  Eventually, the Green Mountain Parkway and National Park were defeated in a statewide referendum in 1936, but that's another story.

What I like most about the Blue Ridge Parkway documentary is that its treatment of the controversies over building the parkway truly exemplifies the debates in other states about similar proposals: taking land out of production, skyline vs flankline approach, questions about environmental effects, arguments among business groups (in this case Tennessee vs. North Carolina).  I also appreciated the commentary from regular folks in North Carolina as well as the observations of the academics.  It packed a lot of information into one hour.

That said, I would have appreciated more background on the claim that Cong. R.L. Doughton ended up horse-trading with FDR over the Blue Ridge Parkway: Social Security in exchange for the North Carolina route.  Sometimes, politicians don't like to put that kind of back-room dealing on paper.  Yet, a bit more information on that score would have been nice.  Also, during the period the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Green Mountain Parkway were being debated, an enormous row was occurring within the hiking and wilderness communities between Benton MacKaye, the originator of the Appalachian Trail idea, and others over bringing roads into wilderness and park areas.  (For more information on this, see Paul Sutter's ""Driven Wild: How the Fight Against Automobiles Launched the Modern Wilderness Movement"" and Matt Dalbey's ""Regional Visionaries and Metropolitan Boosters: Decentralization, Regional Planning, and Parkways During the Interwar Years."").  One more quibble:  Where was Stanley Abbott in all this?

Still, I appreciate what Bruce Bowers did here.  His production gives you a taste of what makes the Blue Ridge Parkway very special.  I may even have to go down there someday.

Lastly, a couple of ironic twists.  While Vermont rejected a parkway and national park, it was Vermonter Calvin Coolidge who, as President, signed the legislation authorizing the creation of both Shenandoah National Park and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  And, it was a Vermonter who was the first American to draw a Social Security check thanks, evidently, to the Blue Ridge Parkway.",1354320000,2,2731,5.292343387470997
8411431,5,B003ZZPL6A,"""As a result of serving twenty five plus years as a seasonal interpretive ranger on the Blue Ridge Parkway and because I authored the pioneering history of the Parkway, I a frequently called upon for interviews regarding the historical and cultural legacy of the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Some of those interviews become television programs.

The latest, and by far the best program, is that of Bruce Bowers whose ""THE BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY: A LONG & WINDING ROAD,"" is ably documented, has a well flowing commentary, and is superbly illustrated.
