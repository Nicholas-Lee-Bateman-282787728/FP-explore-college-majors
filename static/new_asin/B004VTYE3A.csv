4484528,2,B004VTYE3A,"I found the movie to be a waste of time. First, don't expect it to be all that sexy. For the most part it is boring and pointless. I found myself wondering why anyone would even talk about it. I will never waste time with it again. Since when did surgery become sexy? I suppose there is some freak out there that could get into that weird idea but I wouldn't want to meet them. Skip this one.",1413504000,2,392,4.038461538461538

4484530,5,B004VTYE3A,"Do you like thumbing through Gray's Anatomy? The book, not the show. Do you like looking at, palpating, and tracing your loved ones veins? Or getting the stethoscope and listening to their heart and lung sounds? If you do, this might be the romantic movie for you. There is a beauty to the inside of the body that only some people understand, respect, and love. Clearly the negative reviews are not those kind of people.  This movie explores a deep admiration for the functioning of the human body intertwining it with obsession, boundary pushing, and falling in love.",1401926400,4,568,4.795918367346939
4484531,1,B004VTYE3A,Couldn't watch it due to it pausing very couple of minutes and then back tracking. I watched it on my new Kindle that I only had for maybe a week. Very unsatisfied.,1393545600,,164,4.15625

4484534,1,B004VTYE3A,"Don't waste your time on this movie. It moves extremely slowly, the subject matter is bizarre to say the least, and the setting is dull. Even if you want to brush up on your French this isn't too helpful. Forget it. One star is overrated.",1331856000,9,238,4.311111111111111
4484535,1,B004VTYE3A,The movie sucked. The acting was bad and the subject matter was disgusting.  Perverse! A waste of time and money.,1325721600,4,113,4.65
4484536,2,B004VTYE3A,"Sigh, a horrible ending. Disgusting, long and NOT romantic.  A disappointment.  Strange but the lead characters resembled each other so, it seemed incestuous...creepy.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1319932800,19,212,5.774193548387097
4484537,5,B004VTYE3A,"I read reviews for this film, here, and elsewhere before I watched it, and am frankly amused by the ""Yuk"" reviews. They do nothing but perpetuate that stereotype of who cares what is going on inside as long as the outside is perfect. These characters  and I believe partly due to their professions  wanted to know EVERYTHING about each other. Did they go about that in a safe manner ? No... But that takes away little from their intentions, and by the end of it you really do see full on a very deep bond between them. I also think this film is a perfect metaphor for loving entirely as opposed to just the surface. I found this to be an excellent piece of art.",1316649600,52,661,4.28

8444058,2,B004VTYE3A,"Sorry but between her smoking and the numerous radiation exposure---I'll be surprise if this character makes it to 30! As an acute nurse the ending was hilarious.  Add to her radiation exposure, smoking, stupidity and thanks to the ending I guess her fate will be death by sepsis----yuck!  Florence Nightingale would be totally disgusted. A fun date night movie, for us healthcare workers, acting bad....but the ending could possibly be a cult classic, therefore 2 starzz.",1494892800,,472,5.197368421052632
