8728929,5,B013VVQV16,"I subscribed to Gaia through Amazon video just to watch this documentary and it did not disappoint. It is absolutely fascinating, giving me more details from what I first learned from Dr. Emoto in What the Bleep Do We Know nearly 12 years ago. I have to wonder why this science/knowledge isn't more readily adopted. If everyone understood it and took actions to modify the way we treat, view and consume water,  the world would be a healthier, happier, more vibrant place. This film will definitely have a life changing impact on me and I can't wait to hear the reactions of my loved ones as I share it with those around me.",1463443200,,624,4.522123893805309
