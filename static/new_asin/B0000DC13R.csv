1924032,4,B0000DC13R,"I've been a huge fan of Weird Al for nearly 9 years now - and when I found out about the first DVD with his music videos, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately I didn't get my hands on a copy early enough and now they're all gone. I'm very jealous of my friend who managed to get his hands on one.
Anyways, so first chance I could, I placed a preorder for this DVD. I'm extremely happy with it, and recommend it to any Weird Al fan.
There is just ONE thing I dislike. The video is extremely grainy -- even the newer videos like The Saga Begins, and All About The Pentiums have grain, not just the older ones. It's really annoying and kind of disappointing. The audio isn't too bad though -- but it's not as clear as it could be, compared to other Music Video DVD collections by other artists.
Other than these technical blunders, it's a great collection.
Buy it now!",1068163200,7,858,4.237804878048781
1924033,5,B0000DC13R,"This DVD is awesome! It includes all 24 of Al's music videos, and they all look and sound great. The DVD is slightly different from ""Weird Al Yankovic: The Videos"" because the videos on this collection are not in order. They mix them up, and it makes it even more fun to watch them. The DVD also has some great special features. These include a rare 1981 performance from the old NBC Tomorrow Show. It's a performance of ""Another One Rides the Bus"", and Al didn't even have a band yet. It was just John ""Bermuda"" Schwartz banging on Al's accordian case. It's really cool to see such an old performance! The DVD also includes a couple of clips from the old ""Weird Al Show"". These are ""Lousy Haircut"" which was also played on Al's recent concert tour, ""Lasagna"", and ""Livin' in the Fridge"". It also includes a photo gallery and onscreen lyrics. Overall, this DVD is jam packed with entertainment!",1068076800,128,894,4.559006211180124
1924034,5,B0000DC13R,"I just got threw watching this DVD.  I found one easter egg, Go under ""Extras"" then go over to ""The Weird Al Show"" and press up on your DVD remote.  There will be the Archival footage shot in San Luis Obispo, CA in December 1979 for the song ""My Bologna""",1067904000,,254,4.06
1924035,5,B0000DC13R,"I have ""The Videos"" dvd, but this will be a bit better, with two more videos, but i thin that this should have been held off until a  couple of videos were made from poodle hat, beacuse ya know, the only new think on here is the bob altv thing, which isn't really worth it, bu im still getting it cuz im A HUGE AL FAN!",1066608000,2,318,3.8181818181818183
1924036,5,B0000DC13R,"The long wait is well worth it!  All 23 of the greatest music artist in the world's film clips along with the AL TV clip for Bob are on the one sensational DVD.  Getting hold of a copy of the previous The Videos DVD was impossible and in the long run I guess a good thing because now you get all the songs on one DVD.  It is still worth buying the Live DVD and UHF for the film clips on them as, UHF, The Saga Begins and It's All About the Pentiums film clips do not have the behind the scenes commentary on this DVD.  Plus those are two great DVDs in their own right anyway.
It is great to be able to watch the Fat film clip and others which previously you could only see in your memory.  Some songs did not stick around in the charts to actually see the film clips, so if you missed them you can see them for the first time here.  There are subtitles for all the songs if you want to sing along, but as previously mentioned unfortunately no behind the scenes documentary style commentary, which is a bit of shame as they are extremely funny. Would have also liked to have had some AL TV interviews included, like were shown at his concert but alas, you can not have everything.
It is interesting to see the difference in budget and style from the early film clips like Ricky and I Love Rocky Road compared to the polished expensive gems of later album clips like Jurassic Park, Gump, Amish Paradise and The Saga Begins.
Nostalgic value as well as entertainment is all in the one great package.  There is also a photo gallery on here although it is not as expansive as on the other two DVDs.  This is a must buy for fans of comedy, buy this DVD but buy UHF and the Live DVD as well.  For once, we here in Australia actually have something by an American artist released before those in the USA do, but believe me it is worth the wait and your anticipation will not be disappointed.
Of course there are heaps of great songs which were never made into film clips so buy the music albums as well.",1066348800,16,1994,4.171875

Of course we all know the classics like Fat, Like a Surgeon, and Eat It. And now we get the newest video on DVD also!

1924096,5,B0000DC13R,"This collection of Weird Al Yankovic videos is an absolute treasure for all fans. It is an anthology of every one of Al's most memorable videos since he started out in the early 1980s. I remember growing in the MTV era and looking forward to who Al will be parodying next and he rarely ever disappointed.

Watching some of the videos now makes you realize what a true genius Al really is. The video for ""Bob"" was a hilarious parody of Bob Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" using all palindromes (words & phrases that read the same reversed). The video for ""The Bedrock Anthem"" was a clever blend of two Red Hot Chili Peppers' songs (""Under the Bridge"" and ""Give It Away""). The ""Jurassic Park"" video was a visually stunning spoof of the popular movie franchise. My two favorite videos, ""Amish Paradise"" and ""Fat"" are timeless classics that are just as funny and clever as they were when they were released decades ago.

The only thing that I wish was included were the ""Al TV"" segments that aired sporadically on MTV from 1984 to 2006. They would have fake interviews with stars like Sting, Tom Petty and Ozzy Osbourne where Al would use real interview footage but change the questions. Hopefully some day, these segments will be released on DVD.",1414195200,,1249,4.698630136986301

1924102,5,B0000DC13R,"In case you have not noticed, ""Weird Al"" is immensely talented.

But be warned, you really have to know the original videos that he parodies to get your full dose of enjoyment. Hit YouTube as needed, AND THEN watch the parodies. There are a few videos that are not parodies of other videos. Those can be enjoyed by themselves. But if you were a baby in the 80's, it really pays to do your YouTube homework BEFORE.

So read the notes, and proceed accordingly.

There are only a couple of the oldest videos that are not too hot. But the rest... even the ""extra"" material is great.",1403136000,2,578,4.383177570093458

He says if anything he will be making digital copies after this album is made.  This album has been put off because he has had his gull bladder removed in 2013.  But he is okay, he even took a picture of himself after surgery to let people know he was okay.  My favorite albums are... Alapalooza, Straight out of Lynwood, Running With Scissors, poodle Hat, and off the deep end.  Bad Hair Day wasn't too bad either.  Apocalypse is a bit retro for Al, but it is okay, and in my collection.  I own all of his albums, and two 3 DVD's including his hilarious classic UHF movie.",1392768000,,742,4.176056338028169

1924123,4,B0000DC13R,"It took me a while to appreciate ""Weird Al"" Yankovic but somewhere between his 1979 Knack parody ""My Bologna"" and the 2003 release of this ULTIMATE VIDEO COLLECTION, I caught on. ""WEIRD AL"" YANKOVIC: THE ULTIMATE VIDEO COLLECTION comprises videos of two dozen of Yankovic's best-know musical lampoons, complete with a D.V.D. menu from which you select by clicking on quotation marks, as in ""Weird Al.""

Speaking of ""My Bologna,"" I did not notice the link to it in this D.V.D. before returning it to the rental service but as I understand, ULTIMATE VIDEO COLLECTION includes its video. As for Yankovic's other hit from the early days, ""Another One Rides the Bus,"" ULTIMATE VIDEO COLLECTION has a live television performance of the song but if a video was made, it's not included.

I never heard ""Dare to be Stupid"" or ""Bob"" before viewing ULTIMATE VIDEO COLLECTION. Yankovic's dead-on takes on Devo and Bob Dylan impress me; if you know the folk music parody film A MIGHTY WIND, I think ""Dare to be Stupid"" and ""Bob"" come across as authentic as the original folk songs composed for that movie.

Not to thought police ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, but it disappoints me to hear him refer to a woman as a slut in ""Gump.""

""Weird Al"" Yankovic hit just as the music business moved from being radio-centered to the M.T.V. era. Viewing ULTIMATE VIDEO COLLECTION, I notice Al Yankovic is a natural on camera. While he mugs in some of the titles, in others he gets right in character. Maybe the 1989 U.H.F. movie didn't further his career but it would not surprise me to see Yankovic do well were he to get a chance to do some acting in a television show or another film.

The man can sing, too. And is it me, or does Al Yankovic look a little like both Paul McCartney and David Byrne when he comes out from behind his eyeglasses and wigs?",1363046400,,1821,4.57361963190184

I think he only watched 1 other movie during the trip.  None of us minded wether or not he kept his earphones on or not because we had fun listening along while he watched.  About halfway through the trip he realized he could turn on the subtitles so now I think he knows the words to most all of the songs (at least his favorites!)

Totally awesome DVD, it'll make you laugh your head off and sing along. One of my favorite vids is ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"". It's a style-parody of Extreme. The video resembles their ""More Than Words"" video. In this song Al sings so earnestly about how all these ""little"" things his S.O. is doing or has done to him makes him think that maybe she doesn't love him anymore. The video is too funny. It reminds me a little of the Monty Python scetch ""Salad Days"". Then at the end of the video Al goes kind of crazy. I don't want to give too much away, but it's very funny. ""UHF"" is another great video too. Leave it to Weird Al to imitate almost a dozen artist in one 4 minute long video. Also included are clips from his awesome movie of the same name. (Which I loved btw) Another great one is ""Bob"", his homage to Bob Dylan. The song is about how Bob's lyrics seem to make no sense (kinda a similar theme in his ""Smells Like Nirvana"" song). The video is a parody of the Dylan song ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"". A cool note on the song is that he uses all palindromes for the lyrics. (They read the same forward and backward) Very clever, and I would guess time-consuming. But very worth it! I could go on and on about it but just buy it and check it out for yourself.

All the Weird Al classics (up through Poodle Hat) on video.  Little kids can laugh at the slapstick comedy, older people appreciate the humor in both formats.

But also what made the rest of the videos so funny was some actors guess star on some of the videos Drew Carey on track 3 It's all about the Pentiums, Track 2 Amish Paradise with Michele Piffer, so on and so forth.  But if someone was to ask me my honest viewpoint on what were my favorites I would have to tell them Smells like Nirvana, Gump, Jarassic Park, Headline news, and This is the life.  But don't get me wrong I ended up enjoying 22 out of 24 videos on this DVD of the artist Weird Al Yankovic.

This DVD is perfect as it is and doesn't really need anything better than what's on it. I personally think that some of his albums need DVDs with music videos {with the exception of Al's latest: Straight Outta Lynwood on the dualdisc}....but this is almost cooler because this would then be several of them put together as one that you can watch AND listen to, rather than watch some, listen to others and only imagine what they may be like if you could watch them.

The best of the older videos are; ""Fat"", ""Eat It"", and ""Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies""(from UHF).  I also love ""Jurassic Park"" (parody MacArthur Park), ""Gump"", ""The Saga Begins"", ""Amish Paradise"", ""Bedrock Anthem"", and ""Smells Like Nirvana"".  His original videos are fun too, especially the songs ones he wrote for movies; ""UHF""(from UHF),  ""This is The Life""(from Johnny Dangerously), and ""Spy Hard""(from Spy Hard). My absolute favorite from the collection though would have to be ""Bob"".  Everything about it is simply perfect.

The attention to detail in all of the videos is remarkable.  I enjoy ""Weird AL's"" music and videos, the parodys and originals.  I enjoy this collection very much and look forward to more ""Weird Al"" in the future.",1169769600,3,890,5.034246575342466

Worse yet, the newer songs include offensive elements and reach new lows for crudity. Never mind that I don't want my children to see these; I don't want to see them, either. They aren't funny.

1924181,5,B0000DC13R,"Great DVD. from the King of Parodies, Contains almost every video he's ever made.

List and Description of The Videos-

1. Fat- Parody of ''Bad'' By Michael Jackson, Shot on 3/12/88
This grammy award winning Video was shot on a culver city soundstage on a subway set donated by Michael Jackson himself. For this video Al's make-up nearly took 3 hours to apply.
2. Amish Paradise- Parody of ''Gangstas Paradise'' by Coolio shot in Febuary of 96 with appearances by Florence Henderson who plays the Michelle Pfeiffer role in this tale of life on the mean streets of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. One shot in this required Al to phonetically sing the lyrics backwards while walking in reverse through a busy barnyard.
3. It's All About The Pentiums, Parody of ''It's all about the Benjamins'' By Puffy Daddy Video shot in July of 99, this video features cameos by two of the funniest people in the world-, Emo Phillips and Drew Carey.
4. Smells like Nirvana- 1992- Parody of ''Smells like Teen Spirit'' By Nirava, Rolling Stone put this on their list of the top 100 Videos of All Time & Al was nominated for best male performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. This video also used the same janitor as in the video Smells like Teen spirit. Dick Van Patten also turns in a stellar performance.
5. You Dont Love me Anymore- 1992, This song is an Al Original although the video was closely modeled after ''More than Words'' by Extreme.
6. Bedrock Anthem- Parody of Under the Bridge and Give it Away by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Shot in 93- This video was shot on the same exact patch of dessert as the original. The Bee Girl from the Blind Melon video makes an appearance, as does Al's Aunt Dot.
7. Gump- Parody of ''Lump'' by The Presidents Of The United States Of America shot in April Of 1996, Al tells the complete story of Forrest Gump In under 2 minutes. Pat Boone appears in a bench cameo.
8. Jurassic Park, Airing October 93, Parody of ''MacArthur Park'' by Richard Harris-This video went on to be nominated for a Grammy and is still a big favorite in animation festivals around the world.
9. Headline News- parody of ''Mmmm,Mmmm,Mmmm,Mmmm'' by the Crash Test Dummies aired in Oct of 94 and set the legends of John Wayne Bobbitt, Tonya Harding and Singapore Caning victim Michael Fay to the tune of 1994's most hummable hit.
10. Dare To Be Stupid- Although an original composition, 1985's ''Dare to be Stupid'' is a homage to the group Devo, as well as, of course, Al's Motto in Life. I have to say this video is brilliant. This is one of my favorite Weird Al Videos. It incorporates Devo style with Weird Als Genius.
11. Eat It- Febuary of 1984, Parody of '' Beat It'' by Michael Jackson. Al's Grammy Award Winning Parody ''Eat It'' was an immediate international success.
12. Like A Surgeon, Parody of Madonna's '' Like A Virgin'' filmed in March of 85, this video was filmed in an actual hospital that had gone out of business. This, along with the videos ''Dare to be Stupid'' & One More Minute were done as part of a home-video release and television special called '' The Compleat Al''.

13. UHF, shot in June 1989- The video shot for the Original Themesong from Al's Movie was perhaps his most ambitious to date. Al and his band parody in order: Guns n Roses, George Michael, Robert Palmer, Prince, Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel, ZZ Top, Billy Idol, The Beatles, INXS & Randy Newman. Also features guest appearances like Michael Richards & more.
14. Money For Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies- Parody of Money For Nothin' by Dire Straits shot in January of 1989 and was also the centerpiece of Al's Movie UHF, This video features the computer animation of Rick Morris.
15. One More Minute, 1985- This original sick and twisted Elvis like Doo-Wop love ballad has become a perenial favorite among the relationship impaired. Al's long time band members  Jim West, Steve Jay and Jon ''Bermuda'' Schwartz supply the cheesy choreography. Also watch for Al ripping up a picture of the woman who inspired the song.
16. I Lost On Jeopardy, Parody of Jeopardy by Greg Kihn, shot in 1984, is a nostalgic tribute to the old Jeopardy game show. Cameos by original host Art Fleming & original show announcer Don Pardo. Al's mentor Dr. Demento, Al's real parents and Greg Kihn himself.
17. This is the Life- filmed in 84 its a 1930's flavored original and was the theme song for the 1930s gangster spoof ''Johnny Dangerously'' with Micheal Keaton and Danny Devito.
18. Living With A Hernia, Parody of ''Living In America'' by James Brown. Filmd in 86 this parody was shot on the same stage where the Godfather Of Soul shot his scenes for Rocky IV.
19. Spy Hard- Al's third movie theme was the title song from Hollywood Pictures action Spoof Spy Hard starring Leslie Nielson. Shot in 96.
20. Ricky- Parody of ''Mickey'' by Toni Basil, Filmed in April of 83, this one was Al's Music Video Debut. This was arguably the first comedy video ever shown on MTV.
21. Christmas At Ground Zero- This cheery Phil Spector inspired original tune about death, destruction and the end of the world was largely banned by broadcasters, that somehow decided it was a tad morbid to play a song about nuclear annihiliation during the Holidays. A compilation of cold war era scare tactic footage is capped by a live-action shot filmed in the Bronx. Airdate. November 21, 1986.
22. I Love Rocky Road, June of 1983, A Parody of Joan Jett's ''I Love Rock-n-Roll is a tribute to Al's favorite Ice Cream Flavor.
23. Bob- Shot in June of 2003, This is a homage to Bob Dylan's ''Subterranean Homesick Blues'' video  Which was part of the Documentary Dont Look Back.  Filmed in an alley in downtown L.A. It was shot as part of an ''AL-TV'' special that aired on VH1 10 Days Later.
24. The Saga Begins- Aired June 1999, A Parody of Don Mclean's ''American Pie'' is an MTV Unplugged take-off on Star Wars- Episode 1, The Phantom Menace. Shot in a blistering Hot Mojave Desert & a comfy air conditioned soundstage in North Hollywood California.

Special Features- Extras Include clips from the Weird Al Show, a rare 1981 performance clip from NBC's The Tomorrow Show, a photo gallery and on-screen lyrics option!!!

I also hear theres a hidden Easter Egg on the Special Features Section, Highlight ''Weird Al'', then press up and youll be treated to the video ''My Bologna''.

1924182,5,B0000DC13R,"Unless I had a shot of scoth, a shotgun, and Dan Rather, but that's a story for another time.  This DVD basically features ALL of Weird Als music videos, do I need to repeat myself? ALL OF WEIRD AL'S MUSIC VIDEOS!  Not only that but it has a rare 1981 clip from his performance on NBC's The Tomorrow Show, playing his song, Another One Rides The Bus, as only Weird Al could do it.  Also it has clips from his long past show, and a photo gallery of them on the set of many of the music videos.  If this isn't getting you to go out and own the Ultimate Weird Al Collection, nothing will.

It branches from his early years way back in 1983, to the year 2003, a 20 year branch of videos, 24 videos total, all of which are uteraly hilarious.  It also has a little info behind each video and it's making, all of which have something interesting in them.  Need I say more?  BUY THIS DVD AHORA MISS!

Great Quality you can watch them all or pick your favorites to watch.  It has some older footage of Weird Al in the bonus section that is interesting for fans as well.  I found it interesting.  I like it and my kids have probably watched it a dozen times already.  If you are debating between this and his greatest hits CD's then choose this.  This has almost all the songs from his greatest hits vol. 1 and 2 anyways.",1138492800,8,560,3.990990990990991

1924186,5,B0000DC13R,"Usually, when you think of Weird Al Yankovic, you think of a bunch of silly childish humor with the songs that you might have heard over the years.

Yes, you probably heard ""My Bologna"", ""Eat It"", ""Another One Rides the Bus"", etc, etc.  Yes, all that silly Dr. Demento oriented humor.

It's one thing to hear some of those songs.  But, it's fabulous to watch these really cool videos.  Weird Al is alot more talented than you give him credit for.  I play this DVD almost every day.

If you just watch the videos of ""Smells Like Nirvana"", ""It's All About the Pentiums"", ""The Saga Begins"", and the other videos totaling 24 videos plus some unique extras, you will love this DVD.  It's definitely something to play at a party.

Watch it with the subtitles on your first few times.  Yes, Weird Al sings quite clearly, but you won't want to miss a single lyric as you watch these videos.  You'll be on the floor laughing!

Even his song ""Bob"" is quite clever.  It's a Bob Dylan-esque style passage of lyrics, all done in palindromes.  (Sentences that read backwards the same as forwards.)  For example: ""Rise to vote, Sir"",  ""Do geese see God"", ""Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo"",  ""Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog"", ""Race fast, safe car"", ""Do nine men interpret, nine men I nod"", ""Rats live on no evil star"", ""God a red nugget, a fat egg under a dog"", plus so many more.  Even ""Bob"" is a palindrome.  But, I'm sure he hasn't created all these palindromes.  But, he did arrange to have many of them follow each other so that they will rhyme.  I mean, that's a challenge. I see these palindromes and others on a website called palindromelist.com  Check that out. It's kinda fun.

""Jurassic Park"" is a claymation video to the theme of Richard Harris' ""MacArthur Park"", ""Beverly Hillbillies"" is done to the video of ""Money for Nothing"". ""The Saga Begins"" to the song structure of ""American Pie"" (Don McLean). Plus there's ""Amish Paradise"", ""Fat"" done to Michael Jackson's ""Bad"", ""Living with a Hernia"", etc. etc. etc.

Even his own songs ""One More Minute"", and ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"", are side-splitting hilarious!

One hilarious video after another.  Great drinkin', partyin' entertainment.

Not recommended for misery-seeking, generally happy-just-being-depressed surly people.",1136246400,11,2274,4.778920308483291
1924187,5,B0000DC13R,"Being a fan for nearly fifteen years, I knew that this DVD was a must buy and it really is. You get all of Al's music videos all the way up to his videos from the album ""Running With Scissors"". If you love Weird Al and you love his crazier music videos, than this is for you! If you have never heard of this comic genius, this is for you!

I'm always amazed at how he comes up with the parodies he does; and even more amazed how his original songs, that aren't a parody of anything, are just as great. This comes with a small booklet that has about a paragraph each telling about the origins and history of each song.

The extras are few but gold. You have Weird Al's first TV appearance singing ""Another One Rides A Bus"" and you also get clips from The Weird Al Show from 1997 which I used to watch. On that you get mini-video parodies:

""Barber"" a short parody of Prodigy's ""Firestarter""

""Lasagna"" a short parody of ""La Bamba""

""Looking in the Fridge"" a short parody of Aerosmith's ""Living on the Edge""

Not only that, but it has Al's first appearance on TV, which is rather embarassing to watch, and the opening animation to his children's TV show.  All of his videos are pretty decent and my favorites are FAT, Ahmish Paradise, All about the Benjamins, and the spoof on the Phantom Menace.  I even liked the cheapass ""Bob"" video that he probably did with a camcorder in an alleyway with some cardboard signs all in one take.  Or at least it looks that way.  As a huge fan of Al and his work, I dare you not to buy this. You must pay tribute to Al by buying it!  ;-)  I mean, come on, the man can turn armpit farts and dentist drills into fine music.

One thing I didn't see mentioned was that this DVD actually has captions available so you can see all the words and sing along if you want to. This is a plus I always enjoy with concert DVDs, but unfortunately many of them don't include captions. If they do, many only include what is being said between songs and not the actual lyrics to the songs themselves. Not so here. You get them all...so sing along if you want, or just read along to get some of the laughs you might have missed because you didn't quite know the exact words.

If you like Weird AL's type of humor, you're gonna love this DVD. The videos are great! And since Al takes on the role of a new ""character"" in each video, it's like getting a disc with 24 different bands on it!

1924197,5,B0000DC13R,"There are just so many acts that actually don't seem to realize how good music videos can be, without overexposing imagery. While there are many acts like Britney Spears and Usher that have made interesting but oversaturated videos, there really is no feeling to what makes a good music video. Unlike all those acts, Weird Al Yankovic is one of those acts that was just born to make music videos. His songs alone are just good, but what makes him a great video artist is his videos. They are just chock full of zanyness and they are just very, very funny. Unlike most videos, his are just better and better when you watch them, and now they are on DVD for the first time.

Weird Al Yankovic: The Ultimate Video Collection is a remarkable video collection that definitely reflects this wacky video artist. There isn't any video this is missing on this collection, unlike most music video collections that does miss out here and there. The collection includes some of his best videos, including a couple of them that haven't been seen on television at all including great videos like Fat, Eat It, Smells Like Nirvana, Bedrock Anthem, Its All About The Pentiums, Amish Paradise, and Like A Surgeon, to name a few. The videos have been remastered very well, and doesn't at all seem to dissapoint anybody for a moment. It really is just something that really is worth the laughter.

I think that the Weird Al Yankovic ultimate video collection is one of the best music video collections on DVD ever. Although his recording are funny, it is his videos that make him a star. I think it is just sad that his videos aren't on television anymore, except on VH1 Classic. This is a must buy for anybody who loves his zany videos.

1924198,5,B0000DC13R,"What's funnier than listening to a Weird Al CD?  How about watching the videos to his hits?  Yankovic really knew how to convey the absurdity of his songs in image, even though most of them were of his parody songs.  For me, the 1980's was my introduction to him, and looking back, most of his videos parodied the original videos themselves via sight gags.  Sure, some of the material may be non-PC today, but that's what made the fun of it.

They range from his Madonna-like rolling on the floor in the medically-oriented ""Like A Surgeon,"" with even a lion making a cameo appearance, Al in Michael Jackson's leather black studded outfit in ""Fat,"" fat suit added, of course, red leather jacket in ""Eat It,"" and James' Brown's fancy stage dancing in ""Living With A Hernia.""  But the duplication of the computerized animation of Dire Straits' ""Money For Nothing"" in ""Beverly Hillbillies"" taken from UHF, as well as Mark Knopfler's dayglo bandannas, is simply remarkable.  And for sheer silliness, check out the Devo-inspired ""Dare To Be Stupid.""

Al's status as pop culture collector and wizard at turning it into his art can be demonstrated in ""Ricky,"" a B&W replication of ""I Love Lucy.""  It briefly turns into colour at the end, where a cheerleader makes a cameo appearance, in reference to the fact that the song was based on Toni Basil's ""Mickey.""  Using the 1950's B&W clips of ""Duck and Cover,"" scenes of mushroom clouds, and various crude animation for ""Christmas At Ground Zero"" put a silly if not twisted spin on what the US still ridiculously feared as late as the 80's.

The claymation of ""Jurassic Park,"" based on Richard Harris's ""MacArthur Park,"" can't be all that bad for having Barney being decapitated by T-Rex, and the dinosaurs and Al are all pretty funnily realized.  And ""Bedrock Anthem"" -remember ""yabba dabba yabba dabba dabba doo now"" has got to be the most surreal, although the shot of the Bee Girl from the Blind Melon video getting pushed offstage is funny in itself.

Of his newer oeuvre, ""Amish Paradise"" has got to be the funniest, with Al decked out in the height of Amish fashion, black hat, beard and all.  Best gags include the phone that hasn't been used and the implied innuendo of Al churning butter when an Amish female walks by.  Noted for a nonspoken appearance by Florence Henderson.  ""It's All About The Pentiums"" infuses Al's goofiness with the flashy high energy concert and a series of Dilbert-type office cubicles, where the fans are all yuppy-type executives.  And there are enough sight gags to make ""Smells Like Nirvana"" a newer classic, set in the same school as ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""

Wanna see Al bald?  Then check out ""Gump"" where a guy with a haircut eerily like Forrest has all sorts of misadventures with his box of chocolates intercut with scenes of Al and his band.

The lightweight ones, performance clips involving a few laughs are the ballads ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"" and the Elvis-like ""One More Minute.""  Al could've done more with ""The Saga Begins"" as that too is a performance clip with Al in a Jedi robe.

Of note are a few videos for songs that aren't on any Weird Al studio album.  Foremost is ""Headline News,"" set to the Crash Test Dummies' ""Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm,"" and tells of the then-topical events of Michael Fay being caned in Singapore, Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.  And when you have comedian Judy Tenuta as Loreena Bobbitt-watch out!  ""Bob,"" set to a Dylanesque number complete with harmonica, is modeled after the ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" segment of Dylan's Don't Look Back, and has the ingenious method of singing in palindromes(!!!!!)  ""Spy Hard"" is merely the opening titles of the movie, with most of the credits removed.

The bonus features include Al's first TV appearance, on The Tomorrow Show, where he performs ""Another One Rides The Bus"" with his partner John Schwartz, who has a suitcase for a rhythm instrument and silly noisemakers around his neck for him to blow.",1106438400,7,3972,4.7944199706314246

1924200,5,B0000DC13R,"There are only two other artists that I would dare mention in the same league as Weird Al Yankovic, and they are Devo and Spike Jones. Like Devo, Al had the mind set of the music video down better than just about anyone in the business. And like Jones, Al knew that well placed bangs and clatter spun around popular songs could make riveting entertainment. When he combined the two elements and was on full throttle, Al was never anything less than brilliant.

Take what is probably his most infamous video/parody, ""Eat It."" Michael Jackson was slowly creeping towards 23 million ""Thriller's"" sold, and Al saw a perfect target in the mock ""West Side Story"" scenario of ""Beat It."" By using some of the same sets and actors from Jackson's video and then caricaturing them flawlessly, he made a video that was as riotous as Jackson's was ground breaking. Same goes for ""Fat."" But time and time again, Al proved himself to be adaptable. From the ""All About The Pentiums"" send up of Puff Daddy to the ""Dare To Be Stupid"" homage to Devo, Al was completely at home with a wide variety of musical styles. He could write an ace parody like ""Amish Paradise"" and show the original's kinks (Coolio didn't like it very much, but hey, why DID he say ""fool"" every verse?). Or he could take a genre formula and write a great period piece with a sly wink (""Johnny Dangerously's"" theme ""This Is The Life"" or the doo-wop laff-riot ""One More Minute""). It's also more than a little telling that near half the acts Al poked fun at on this DVD are no longer around.

Perhaps the purist measure of Al's greatness is not only the longevity of the work here, but his obvious affection for the music. Unlike many satirists of rock and roll, (Steve Allen and Stan Freeburg both come to mind)  who did their parodies out of dislike for the music, Al loves the stuff and the artists involved knew it. Devo once commented that they thought ""Dare To be Stupid"" was their favorite Devo song, Mark Knopfler insisted that he play on the ""Money For Nothing"" parody, and Kurt Cobain said he knew that Nirvana had made it when ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" got Yankovic-ed. That's why this DVD is a five star artifact. It has a special place in the all too few music DVD's that I have in my collection.

PS: Just as much a reason to have this, the ""Tomorrow Show"" performance of ""Another One Rides The Bus,"" with 'Bermuda' Schwartz banging the accordion case and Al playing barefoot!",1105574400,3,2441,4.540909090909091
1924201,5,B0000DC13R,"Weird Al Wankovic's ""The Ultimate Video Collection"" is great fun.  Yankovic has had a sucessful career at parodies, and to this day, while Yankovic is still popular, it is great to see that Yankovic has released a DVD with twenty-four music videos, all of which are all the videos Yankovic has ever done.  The videos for the parodies on this DVD are parodies of songs, movies, and television shows. I can think of nothing better than to have a DVD that contains over an hour of every Weird Al video on one DVD.  Here we have videos of Yankovic's parodies of movies such as ""All About The Benjamins"" (which, on this DVD, is ""All About The Pentiums""), and a few other famous movies, while songs by artists such as The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Madonna, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Nirvana, among others, are being parodied also.  One video on here, ""Bedrock Anthem"" is not only a parody of ""The Flintstones"", but of two songs by The Red Hot Chili Peppers also(""Under The Bridge"" and ""Give It Away"").  There are also extras on this DVD, which include clips from ""The Weird Al Show"", a rare 1981 performance clip from NBC's ""The Tommorow Show"", a photo gallery, and an on-screen lyrics option.  Weird Al Yankovic is a master of parodies, and if you are a Weird Al fan, you should check out this DVD.",1104624000,2,1307,4.564102564102564

If you turn subtitles on you can karaoke along with Al too. The only drawback is that the video quality on some of the selections hasn't been restored (or it wasn't all that great in the first place-not sure) so it's a little grainy.

He's lucky there are enough of us that are nostalgic for all things Al, because his newer works, that are among his best, have not been as popular as they should be. Its amazing to me the people who upon hearing that I listen to Weird Al think the last thing he put out was Smells Like Nirvana. Running with scissors was probably Al at his best but All about the Pentiums was barely shown on TV.

While the collection of videos alone is worth the price you pay, it is quite disappointing that the disc is devoid of special features. It would have been nice to have some of his live material( other than Tom Snyder) and his Al TV interviews that are hilarious. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

 So what brings this down from perfect, I hear you ask? Well, first of all, I'm not really fond of some of the videos as can be seen, but the thing that really annoys me the most is when you watch the videos, there's always this flickering going on at the top of the picture that's really irritating. I think that's ""grain"", but whatever it is it really lets the quality down. Also there's not to much special features apart from the great photo gallery and the lyrics, but I guess I can't complain, they chopped the special features off for the Region 4 version (which is what I have). Either way if you're an Al fan and are debating whether to buy this or not, do buy it, because it shows how Al was able to maintain quality through these three wonderful decades and if you like Al, you won't find a better product.

--------------------------------------------------

It shouldn't pose much of a problem to put together a DVD containing a collection of music videos. So how come the makers of this disc got so much wrong?

1. The videos are not in chronological order. That right there is a major no-no.

2. There is a layer change-type pause inbetween EVERY video (I think they put each video on it's on Title and my player has to pause in order to retrieve the video). Because of this, some of the extreme end of the audio for each video gets cut off.

3. There are some compression artifacts, such as at the very end fade outs of ""I Lost On Jeopardy"" and ""The Saga Begins"", and after the movie clip montage in ""UHF"". Considering the total length of the videos is 86 minutes (plus another 10-15 minutes for the bonus features), there should not have been a need for very much compression, so there should be no artifacts at all.

It should also be noted that the Spy Hard video has two titles: ""Spy Hard"" and ""Opening Title Sequence by 'Weird Al' Yankovic."" The one on his previous DVD release (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weird-Al-Yankovic-The-Videos/dp/6305075654/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weird Al Yankovic: The Videos</a>"") has no titles at all. Of course, in the film ""Spy Hard"" all of the titles are present. This means that there are now three different versions of this video.",1088899200,6,1953,5.46843853820598

The first time that we saw it, we laughed our heads off. Al is so talented and hilarious! I agree with another reviewer that some of the blood and guts scenes aren't for younger children, but other than that, it's a great entertaining DVD that you can even pop in and play without watching it if you like his music. We've watched it about 10 times so far and nobody has gotten sick of it yet.",1087516800,4,515,4.319587628865979

1924214,5,B0000DC13R,"I'm basing my review on the region 4 version of Al's DVD, which has no extra features, just the 24 videos.  And what videos they are.  I have been a big fan of Al for 2 years now.  Before buyibg the DVD I only saw the Eat It video.
All of the Videos are well set out, well presented, and fit in well with the lyrics.  The sound of the video is equal to that of the various CD's.  The songs are identical to the various CD's.  The only difference is that UHF Video is cut a little compared to the CD version.  I prefer the DVD version.
Another way of telling how good the videos are is comparing his 80's videos to his 90's & 00's videos.  Both sets are of high quality.
In conclusion You should buy this DVD.  For Al fans, this is the only way to get all of Al's songs on one disc.  For people who are undecided if Al is for them, These some of Al's best songs, and the videos have been put together briliantly, and the video quality is very good.

If you enjoyed watching and listening to Weird Al's great spoofs and originals, haven't seen them for years and years, and have heard that they are now available on one DVD and you think you would love to see all those funny videos again:
You may find that they were funnier in your imagination. [Sounds like Paul Simon's Kodachrome, doesn't it!] You may find that you have forgotten the videos the parodies are based on. You used to enjoy all the jokes on Madonna and Michael Jackson, but now you can't remember their video clips and there is something missing.
This was my first reaction. But I am over it and am now enjoying them as much as I ever did.
