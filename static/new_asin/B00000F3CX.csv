to cover the later years. The production is among the best I have seen. There is nothing that Edward Fox wore that I would reject.

10 second scences required different wardrobe. I know Edward was a careful and distinguished dresser , but James Fox oudoes him on all counts. The sets and dress were equal to the story",1126483200,4,383,4.093333333333334
1200678,5,B00000F3CX,"...and possibly as close to this story as we can now get given that social values of 1936 have long since died and changed immeasurably. The story is well known, we all of us have a notion of the bare bones, here the meeting of the two through to the develpoment of the story and their undoubted love for each other is depicted beautifully. Fox is superbly crusty and full of emotionless Britishness, Harris is slightly the bright young thing/fliberty gibbert but she reveals more of the character of Simpson way beyond the demonised manipulator she has been cast as by history. Excellent and compelling viewing with fantastic period detail.",1118016000,10,641,4.836363636363636
1200679,4,B00000F3CX,"""The King of England and the woman for whom he gave up a throne"" has nearly passed into legend, as has the much re-recorded abdication speech give by Edward VIII in which he explained in his own voice (kings by tradition had no right to express personal opinions in public) that all he wanted was to be with the woman he loved. Whether or not she was a scheming Lady Macbeth who wanted to be a queen will never really be known, but it makes an interesting challenge for an actress who plays the part of the American, twice-divorced Mrs. Simpson.

 I was delighted to learn that A&E has restored the 1978 mini-series, ""Edward & Mrs. Simpson"" in a boxed set of two DVDs (AAE 71753). In seven episodes of 50 minutes each, it tells the tale of how Edward (Edward Fox) first runs into Wallis Simpson (Cynthia Harris), becomes obsessed with her, drives all of the higher-ups in the British government half mad seeking ways to satisfy their master and at the same time stopping a marriage which could not constitutionally exist.

 As scripted, Simpson is no sympathetic character but a woman used to getting what she wants, even if it is  the next King of England. Unhappily, Edward (who is called David throughout the series) is shown to be a spoiled brat who often puts his pleasures before his duties; and by the time one might really feel sorry for him, some can only say, ""What did you expect?"" and ""You got what you thoroughly deserved.""

 As fine as Fox and Harris are as actors, there is none of that special ""chemistry"" needed to convince us that these two were (or at least that he was) so madly obsessed with each other. And while there is much talk about how fascinating Wallis was to all who met her, the viewer hardly sees anything matching that description.

 But what a pleasure it is to see consummate actors do their stuff, especially supported by such British stars as Nigel Hawthorne, Peggy Ashcroft (as the outraged Queen Mary),  John Shrapnel, David Waller (as the long-suffering Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin), Patricia Hodge (from the Rumpole series), and too many others to mention here.

 A final irony is found in the bonus feature, ""Wallis Simpson"" from A&E's Biography series, when we are told that Simpson was carrying on another affair all through her stalking of Edward! It would be interesting to know how this would have changed the script if this information were known back then.

 In sum, although I think that just under six hours is far too long to carry this story and keep things sparking (150 minutes would have been about right), I can still recommend this set for the acting, the period dcor, and the discussions it is bound to stimulate among the viewers.",1109203200,76,2695,4.646315789473684
1200680,5,B00000F3CX,"This mini-series gets my vote as the best TV biographical drama ever made.  The acting, as is the case in most of these British productions, is superb, with Edward Fox's letter-perfect portrayal of the self-destructive Edward VIII serving as the show's centerpiece.  Fox conveys the Prince's boyish charm, as well as his fatal weakness, callowness, thick-headedness and insecurity, so well that you could almost swear you were watching an old newsreel.

The script (unusually for a television docudrama) is also near-perfect--witty, historically accurate, and full of a subtle irony perfect for describing a social/political crisis that was part tragedy, part farce.

Even if you think you have no interest in poor, silly Edward and his self-inflicted downfall, watch this production anyway.  You won't regret it.",1103241600,8,813,5.472
1200681,5,B00000F3CX,"This outstanding British TV-film, originally broadcast in 1978, was dramatized from Frances Donaldson's magisterial 1974 biography of the duke of Windsor. Of all the biographies written about this sad, complex man, Donaldson's dominates the field, as the duke's official biographer admitted in his preface. The 1978 film outstrips any yet made about the duke and duchess, especially two lamentable TV films:  ""The Woman I Love"" (1972), with Richard Chamberlain as Edward VIII/ duke of Windsor trying to act royal opposite a most unconvincing Faye Dunaway as Mrs Simpson, and ""The Woman He Loved"" (1988), with Antony Edwards mumbling incomprehensibly opposite an even less convincing Jane Seymour (in the worst old-age makeup ever inflicted on a TV audience).

""Edward and Mrs Simpson,"" in contrast, is impeccably cast and acted from start to finish.  I imagine the existing Royal Family's displeasure with yet another TV film about their most famous black sheep may have been all that kept this film from receiving the public awards it deserved.

Cynthia Harris is the most believable Wallis Simpson on film--an American woman mystified by the intricacies of life in Britain in the 1930's, when an island kingdom struggled to preserve the ghosts of Empire.  As prince of Wales/Edward VIII/duke of Windsor, Edward Fox flawlessly combines brittle arrogance with the fatal misunderstandings of the realities of his position that doomed Edward's reign. Even lesser roles are superb: Nigel Hawthorne, best remembered for his turn as Edward VIII's mad ancestor George III, marvellously captures the difficult position in which the king's advisor Walter Monckton found himself in 1936.  Amanda Reiss as duchess of York (then Queen Elizabeth, finally the late Queen Mother), bears an uncanny physical resemblance to the real duchess and conveys that lady's apprehension and fury as she grasps the implications of the crisis with which Edward's love for Mrs Simpson confronted his brother and frail heir-presumptive the duke of York (later George VI, father of Elizabeth II).

In addition to the excellent acting, the film realistically portrays British life in the 1930's and the role the nation's outlook played in ending Edward's reign.  Costumes, sets, cars, even cigarettes without filters (a point often overlooked in period films set before the 1950's)--all these combine to re-create a society now long vanished.  Understanding just how that society functioned is vital to comprehending how it could have come about that a king, regardless of his popularity as prince of Wales, could find himself left with no choice but to abandon throne and people because his prospective wife was unacceptable to an Establishment of whose strength and influence Edward had somehow managed to keep himself almost entirely ignorant.

Perhaps nothing sums up this fundamental conundrum better than the director's inspired choice to accompany the film's credits with a popular song from Edward VIII's youth:

""I've danced with a boy, who danced with a girl, who danced with the Prince of Wales! It was simply grand--he said, 'Topping band!' and she said, 'Delightful, sir'....""",1095724800,11,3158,5.35959595959596
1200682,4,B00000F3CX,"After watching this on BBC I knew I had to have it and I knew just where I could find it.

1200684,4,B00000F3CX,"""Edward and Mrs Simpson"" is a dramatization of the Abdication Crisis of 1936.  The first parts, which deal with Edward's meeting Wallis Simpson and falling in love with her, are well done, highly dramatic but staying close to the real events. Things get a bit tedious towards the end when the show focusses more on the negotiations between the King, the Prime Minister, and the other Parliament and Commonwealth leaders than on the two principal characters.  Even so, ""Edward and Mrs Simpson"" is well worth the money.",972604800,11,517,4.931034482758621

1200772,3,B00000F3CX,"Thanks to the Lady Georgiana books by Rhys Bowen (starting with Her Royal Spyness), I've gotten interested in the British royalty of the 1930's and especially the scandal involving Prince and then King Edward and the American Mrs. Simpson.  I decided it was time to learn a bit more about them, so I checked the 7 part mini-series Edward & Mrs. Simpson out of the library.  I almost gave up part way through the first episode, but despite some weaknesses, I'm glad I stuck it out.

As the first episode opens, we are introduced to the future King Edward the VIII (Edward Fox) as he plans a trip to Africa.  His biggest concern is which of his mistresses to take with him.  Even though he's in his 30's, he hasn't found a woman to settle down with, and continues his relationships with usually married women.

But then he meets American Wallis Simpson (Cynthia Harris).  Already divorced once, she is on her second husband, Ernest (Charles Keating).  The two quickly become part of Edward's inner circle of friends and are even invited to his country estate for weekend trips.

As the two grow closer, Edward's father dies and Edward becomes king.  But now Edward has to make a choice.  Will he remain king or marry Wallis?  Or is there another option where he can marry a twice divorced woman?  Would the country and the laws permit it if he did?

As I said, I almost quit in the middle of the first episode.  It was the production style that just got to me.  It involves many quick scenes with hardly any set up or explanation, and I spent forever trying to figure out just exactly who some of the people were and what was going on.  Even now, I don't quite get who a few people in that episode were.  Once Wallis arrived, I was able to follow things better, although the next episode was again hard to get into and follow.  By the third episode, I was fully on board and began to really enjoy the piece.

Not to say that things ever truly got better, but once you knew to expect some abruptness and got to know the key players, it did get much easier to follow.  It also helped that I got to know both of the leads and really did feel for them as they fell in love.  Edward becomes king at the end of the second episode, so much of it is spent on the almost year long efforts to reconcile the law with Edward's desire.  Contrast that with the 3 or 4 years that pass in the first two episodes, and you can see another reason the show gets better.

Maybe it's just that I'm the wrong audience.  This was a show made for British TV back in the 1970's, so maybe I just don't get the style they used.  It also shows in other ways, like the incidental music used in a scene but rarely between scenes and some of the scenes that seemed pointless to me.

But I did get into it as the story unfolded.  Once they slow down time, as it were, and start really focusing on the politics of what happened, it's hard to stop watching because you get drawn into the people and events depicted.

One thing that really helped me get into the story was the acting.  I liked all the players, and it made me root for all the characters to wind up happy (even though I already knew the outcome).  While I have heard that Wallis was not at all happy with how she was portrayed here, I thought the series did a good job of making both her and Edward sympathetic characters.  This was especially true when the scandal hit the press.  You gain a new appreciation for what celebrities face.

I also couldn't help but look at how far we've come.  Here was a scandal that lost someone his throne over divorce.  Now, people rarely blink at it, even for the British royalty.  Frankly, I think that's a sad commentary on our culture.

The mini-series consisted of seven 50 minute episodes, and they are included on this two disc set.  The picture could be a little better and sharper, but it is certainly watchable.  The set was released here in America by A&E, so the only extra we get is their Biography of the two principle players.  I watched that last, and it really helped fill in the gaps I still had from the show itself.  In fact, I almost wished I had watched that first.

Because of my interest in the people and time period, I am glad I watched Edward & Mrs. Simpson.  If I hadn't been already interested, I probably would have passed.  I recommend it, but only for those who want to learn more about this story.  The show won't survive casual interest.",1433376000,,4434,4.332928311057108

1200816,5,B00000F3CX,"With a Master's Degree in English History, I loved it.  This is why Edward VIII abdicated the English throne to become the Duke of Windsor.  Parliament would not approve the marriage of King Edward VIII and Wallis Warfield Simpson because for one thing she was an American, and the other reason, she was twice divorced.  She had non-scriptural reasons for her divorces.  The Bible does not view incompatibility as a scriptural reason for divorce.  The Bible gives only one reason for a scriptural divorce and that is adultery (fornication), so the Church of England (Edward as King would have been the head of the Church of England) would not approve the wedding either.  They stated they would have no adulteress as Queen of England.  When King George V died, Edward's father, Edward automatically became King.  He talked with his mother, Queen Mary, and told her he would abdicate because he could not carry out his duties as monarch, without the woman he loved beside him as his wife. The next in line to become the monarch was George VI, the father of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  All of this is brought to light in this video!  Excellent!!

It finishes when they marry, so many of the post-wedding years are not mentioned. It would have been nice to make a second series, since they were very interesting, starting with them giving the Royal Family many a headache and they were kicked out to the Bahamas.
I just came across a book about their personal letters between 1931 to 1937. It is of astonishing  banality and just silliness.
Her life was just parties, dinners, cocktails and trying to grab a  dollar from everybody. His were ""I want to kiss my sweetheart good night"".

1200899,3,B00000F3CX,"The title of this review is a quote from Adolf Hitler in reference to Mrs. Simpson's qualities as hypothetical Queen had she won the gold, which it seems likely she wished to do. The Fuhrer met both she and her husband, the late King of England, when the newlyweds visited Hitler at Berchtesgaden in 1937.  What there is nary a whisper of in this seven part mini-series from 1978 are the extremely pro-Nazi sympathies of both Edward and Mrs. Simpson.

Now it is told that Hitler's favorite movies were KING KONG and SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  Who can comprehend the ultimate psychological and aesthetic reasons for his cinematic predilections?  There is simply no accounting for taste! Just as one is left not truly knowing what it was magnetized the Prince of Wales to the social-climber Wallis Simpson.  The fairytale of it all being about LOVE is pretty much in dispute.  Perhaps the marrying a twice-divorced woman that would force the King to abdicate was more an excuse to quit a throne he never really felt comfortable sitting upon.  Perhaps the Prince longed to be a Pauper and, with a masochistic streak that is common in men in powerful positions, perhaps he found his domme in Wallis.  Hitler, too, it is said, craved scatologic debasements that truly ran afoul of the Wagnerian persona that was the dictator's public facade.  History in the spotlight may show surface warts and blemishes, but torrid Truth often thrives best in dank darkness and steamy shadow.  Like mushrooms at night, much is the story of Mankind.

So entertaining though this production most definitely is to those in the dark as to the fuller picture, once one knows that infernal more, the mini-series seems to be precisely that, more entertaining than truly educational on an emotional level.  EDWARD AND MRS. SIMPSON is, actually, more of an examination of British law and politics and custom than it is about LOVE.  There is no scripted or otherwise spark twixt the two leads, no hint of an understanding as to what it was between them.  None of the perplexed cast of characters ever even asks either one of them what it is, precisely, they so much love about one another.  Perhaps, historically, more contemporaneous folks were in the know as to the true reasons for the attraction which led to abdication than we sideliners and spectators will ever know.

In some of the other reviews, mention is made of a biography of Mrs. Simpson as extra.  I have the two-disc A&E DVD, all five hours and thirty minutes of it - but there is no extra biography to be found on either disc.  Strange.

1200907,4,B00000F3CX,"I have had this on VHS many years and have looked at it many times. I ordered the DVD hoping that it would be remastered.  Apparently it has not been remastered.  It is somewhat better than the VHS tape but not a lot better. I've never seen a more annoying portrayal of anybody than this of Mrs. Simpson. It may be accurate but if that is really the way she talked then I can't imagine anybody being able to stand to be around her for more than l0 minutes at a time. And, while Mrs. Simpson was not young and not a beauty, I think they could have found a little more attractive actress for the role. I always had the picture in my mind of Mrs. Simpson as someone with a soft southern voice, gentle manner, immense charm, the ability to convince others that she was pretty.  She would have a wonderful sense of humor and would have been able to convince others that she found them fascinating. The way she plays it just doesn't fit to me at all. Cold and calculating is a better description of this woman. And, I agree with another viewer that there is no real connection between them. One gets no sense of a deep love on either of their parts nor a real sexual connection between them. He had a history of becoming involved with married women but this time he apparently got involved with the wrong married woman. One who would suck him into the affair so deeply that he didn't know how to get out nor did he really want to. In her madly egotistical mind and her ignorance she really thought that she could be Queen of England. Royal children were traditionally under the thumb of domineering Nannies and it's possible that he never grew out of his thinking that love and domination were one thing. There has been much talk of things that she learned in the far east that enslaved him and this may or may not be true. I just think he was really looking for a way out of having to be King and used this as what he considered to be the honorable way out. After all, he was already doing a crappy job of it before the abdication.  He had to put on an act to convince her that he didn't want to abdicate as apparently she never gave him a minute's peace. In the end, of course, he did. All in all it was the best thing for the country. I guess God really does move in mysterious ways. Edward VIII would have been a disaster as a war time King and there is no doubt in my mind that England would have come under Nazi control under his rule. If you can stand her voice and her unattractiveness, this is a very good series about what happened during that period of time. The part of Edward is well cast and played.",1353196800,4,2607,4.208

Both run a continuous 2 hours, with no hourly interruptions for titles or end credits. Thus, six one-hour chapters have been reduced to Parts One and Two.

I've never seen ""Edward & Mrs. S."" in its full 350 minute form. Even subtracting 15 minutes for excised credit scrolls, that means upwards of an hour of programming is missing.

As is often the case when you've waited so long to see something again, I was a bit apprehensive.  Would it be as good as I remembered? or had it become made of gold because I'd fogotten it?

Not disappointed and it is an excellent transfer to DVD.  I have seen several movies/mini-series on this subject and this is still the best. The mannerisms of the King and of Mrs. Simpson were even spot on.  The ""Biography"" episode of Wallis Simpson was a nice bonus feature. It's funny that, when Cynthis Harris showed up on Seinfeld years later (Jerry's mom, I think), she was still ""Wally"" to me!

The complicated behind-the-scenes drama is amazing. If you have read Ralph Martin's superior biography ""The Woman He Loved"" (available on Amazon.com), you would have a clue, but otherwise you will be surprised at how much a British king's life is not his own to command. You will get lost in the show and forget these are actors, as is the norm for Brit TV.  Understated = well-done.

1201002,4,B00000F3CX,"The scandal that brought down a King is examined in detail in this 1978 English miniseries.  We meet Edward, Prince of Wales (Edward Fox), who eschews royal responsibilities and propriety in favor of a rather hedonistic life style.  He'd had a string of affairs before he met Wallis Simpson (Cynthia Harris), a once-divorced, married American woman in 1931.  She is shown to be a calculating spider, he the willing fly.  When he becomes King and insists upon marrying her, his actions threaten to destroy the monarchy.

Edward Fox is perfectly cast as the spoiled and boyish Prince; it is a pleasure to watch him completely inhabit the character.  Cynthia Harris, on the other hand, is never believable as Mrs. Simpson; none of her lines sound spontaneous and her stiff acting weakens the show.  The supporting cast, including Peggy Ashcroft as Queen Mary, is wonderful, but the scenes where Edward's advisors endlessly debate the sticky situation are tedious.

Still, it's a fascinating story despite its faults and it's fun to watch the Royals' private lives.  3.5 stars.",1275436800,6,1073,5.051136363636363
1201003,4,B00000F3CX,"We have recently developed a fascination with the era of the 20s and 30s both here and in Britain. This in part may be due to experiencing the worst financial crisis of our life in the last two years.  The era pre and post 1929 crash and depression and WWII serve as a window into what these two societies were like and how they managed to come out of these exceptionally trying times to thrive in years to come.  That said, about the Masterpiece Theater ""Edward and Mrs. Simpson"", a very well done series and worth the watch with some caveats.

The story line is well told by many other reviewers so I will not repeat it here only to say it is a good history lesson about how the British view their royalty and the love affair between the King to be played brilliantly by Edward Fox and Mrs. Simpson also brilliantly played by Cynthia Harris.  I agree with all the other reviewers that both of these excellent actors capture the character of the selfish nearly childish, self absorbed playboy Prince of Wales and the social climbing somewhat devious getting her man at all cost, Mrs. Simpson.  The settings are period correct and the transfer from the original screening to DVD was very good.

As mentioned by some reviewers the storyline did drag at points and more time could have been spent on the Prince and Mrs. Simpson rather than all the stogy British parliamentary figures.  It is understandable that as part telling the story that has fascinated people since the abdication to this time, we would want more salacious details, more sumptuous gowns, and jewels as the upper royal class was prone to wear even to breakfast.  Queen Mary with multiple strands of pearls mid day may have been a window into the reason for the decline in the Royal family's popularity.  Being American I know the British would strongly disagree as they do not like anyone criticizing their Royalty.  The long drawn out dialogue and hand ringing by the aids to the King (This is where Royalty trumps logic.  They refer to him as King yet he has yet to be crowned so would he not still be the Prince?  Understanding the British Royal ""system"" as an American could consume a lot of time!)  although at times boring and slow showed how much time they spent trying to figure out Mrs. Simpson's motives once she was divorced and what the Kings intentions were towards her in terms of marriage.  As much as it was slow paced and somewhat boring towards the middle of the series, it did contribute to the historical understanding of why he could not marry Mrs. Simpson as King, leaving the question of abdication as the only solution.

More interplay between Edward and Wallace during this time would have offered up more insight into the character of these two individuals and who was really the driving force in Edward's future.  Wallace seemed very insecure about letting him out of her sight for any length of time given his reputation for being a play boy and the fact he was under great pressure by his family and a cast of many self serving politicians to do the right thing and just keep her as his consort.  Historically that does seem to be the British solution.  Edward could have married a woman he did not love, pop out a couple of Royalty and gone about with his affair and still be king.  This is the Prince Charles modern day solution.  All this leads to the question of whether or not Edward would have made a good King or was the country better off with his brother on the throne?  If you are looking for this series to provide insight into this question you may be disappointed.  It leaves this up to the viewer to decide if anyone could be that crazy in love with a cloying older woman that he would give up the position to which he were born and bred to assume.  Maybe you have to be British or have studied the Royal family to get all the innuendos and subtleties.

The miniseries is worth the time to wade through the slow parts and perhaps understand how the British handle crisis around their Royal family. Now it is on to another miniseries about Albert and the Queen mum!

As a final comment, I realize the British are very sensitve about criticism of their Royality by anyone but themselves.  Having several good British friends I hope they will forgive me any treading on forbidden water by an American!",1263081600,2,4310,4.5433376455368695

1201008,4,B00000F3CX,"Having long been intrigued by the tale of Edward VIII, the English king who gave up the throne to be with the woman he loved an American divorce named Wallis Simpson imagine my surprise at discovering that there existed this miniseres. Not only was there a miniseries about the subject but that one of my favorite actors (Edward Fox) was playing the famed King himself. The result is a rather grand, if slightly overlong, historical drama.

As in the case of many a historical drama, the cast is fine one. Edward Fox gives one of the finest performances of his career as the famed King Edward VIII from the dashing playboy Prince Of Wales to the man who gives up the throne for the woman he loves. Cynthia Harris gives a nice performance as the woman he loved Wallis Simpson though she does have a tendency to overact. Thankfully both Fox and Harris share a nice chemistry between them that makes them quite convincing as the famed couple.

The supporting cast is fine as well. David Waller gives a fine performance as the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin who tires to keep the government together in the midsts of the crisis caused by the title characters as does Peggy Ashcroft as the famed Queen Mary. From Nigel Hawthorne as Edward's friend Walter Monkton to Wensley Pithey as Winston Churchill to Charles Keating as Wallis husband Ernest Simpson to Marius Goring and Patrick Troughton as opposition leader Clement Attlee the cast is a fine one and makes this drama well worth seeing.

Things are strong behind the camera as well. The sets by Allan Cameron and the costumes by Jennie Tate perfectly capture the spirit of the 1930's in which this famed story took place. The score and opening song by Ron Grainer also captures the atmosphere of the 1930's as well. Even better, the script by Simon Raven (from the biography Edrward VIII by Frances Donaldson) is a true highlight. With its attention to details and events the script gives a detailed study of a royal romance that doesn't quite end happily. The dialouge in particular makes the production stand out and gives the whole production an epic quality thanks to the wonderful direction of Waris Hussein.

If the miniseries has any fault it is that it seems overlong. At seven fifty minute episodes (or right around six hours) it feels as though it could have been trimmed down at times. There aren't many slow moments in the miniseries but one wonders if those scenes trimmed could have made Edward & Mrs. Simpson slightly shorter.

Despite is length Edward & Mrs. Simpson is a fine drama. From its two leading actors to the supporting cast, production values, direction and writing this is a fine example of the art of the miniseries.

1201035,4,B00000F3CX,"""Edward & Mrs. Simpson"" is the best available dramatization of the events leading up to the abdication of King Edward VIII, but it could have been so much better.  Part of the problem is that there was so more to the story that could have been told, but wasn't told here.  The last few weeks just prior to the fateful event were filled with enormous tension-much more so than this production was able to present. Supporters took to the streets; Stanley Baldwin and the cabinet were in frequent session dealing with the momentous events that were transpiring; the air was charged; Wallis WAS in fact looking for a way out, she was in danger, and many in England held their breath.  And there was the very provocative possibility that  while these things were going on Wallis was ""two-timing"" Edward/David with a handsome young car salesman.  At least she was seeing him behind his back. That ""fact"" probably could not have been added to this British production at the time it was made, as Wallis was still then alive.  Still, a more complete picture would have made a gem of a film or series, but it would be an enormous challenge. The story is high drama befitting an opera as much as a mini-series.  Nevertheless, this is the best we have and we should be more than happy to have it.  Subsequent efforts have been pretty terrible. This is a gem but not a diamond, not quite.  The characters of Bertie and Elizabeth are not well drawn and casting for those parts was not very good.  But in the final analysis I would say: don't pass this up if you are interested Edward and Mrs. Simpson and the abdication crisis.  Grab it while you can get it!  The history, as far as it goes, is pretty accurate thank the Lord; the clothes and period details are near perfect and beautiful and worth the price of admission.  Two final points should be made: Edward Fox is terrific as the Prince of Wales/King/Duke; and the addition of the A&E ""Biography"" series program on Wallis is a nice conclusion to the set.",1160956800,21,1997,4.544692737430168
1201036,5,B00000F3CX,"I like this Thames Television/A&E  version immensely.  It's in color of course.  Edward Fox and Cynthia Harris are Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.  The setting, costumes, dialogue: all these are so authentic.  Whenever I see this version, I feel overwhelming sympathy for both Wallis and Edward.  I tend to feel that love trumps duty in a competition when opposed to an institution that has several ""heirs.""  For a job such as that, anyone can follow the traditional protocols, but for a real love there are only the two individuals.  The real evil in this story was that the Duke of Windsor's family did not forgive him for so many years in support of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon's (Elizabeth II's mother; George VI's wife) revenge.  Boooo!  Now how noble is stubborn revenge???  And how noble is it to risk everything for love???

I am appeased when I realize that exile was not too bad for them, nor was a frivolous life of pleasure, as opposed to giving up a love that stood the test of time by doing what institutionalized mindsets want.  I feel that if you don't have a chance at real love, then hey, . . . love a dog, cat, or your job.  But if you can give and receive love, then this is a miracle not to be missed.

Of course, there are stories of how Wallis abused the Duke, and how he was some kind of wimp, but I find far better and stronger evidence to support their mutual love.

Please see the A&E Biography Documentary at the end of Disk 2.  It is a needed conclusion to what happened after the wedding.

It's difficult to believe it is already 25 years since it aired on television.  Amazing how time flies and history repeats itself. The acting is superb.  The actors are almost the mirror-image of the actual Edward and Wallis Simpson.  There is one scene that is worth the price of the two discs: When the Duke of Windsor's girlfriend returns from her visit to the US, is invited to the Duke's home for tea and is startled to see her best friend, Mrs. Simpson rush in with the Prince acting as if she owns the place.  There is the wink and the nod that told the world: this is serious.  I never tire of looking at that.

At the time people in certain circles couldn't get enough of the Prince and Mrs. Simpson.  Then, when they fell out of favor and were banished from England, those closest to them were banished as well.  The same thing pretty much happened after Prince Charles and Lady Diana's divorce.  Those people close to Diana were no longer welcome at certain events.  Now it's Charles and Camilla.  The people who rallied to their side after the separation are safe, for now.  For such a small island England has mesmerized the world for centuries and centuries.

While the Charles and Diana story will be around for some time, 100 years from now, people will still be reading and talking about the Duke of Windsor and the American, Mrs. Simpson.  This film gives you the entire story from beginning to the beginning of the end.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a deep affection for England (as do I) and a love of history.
