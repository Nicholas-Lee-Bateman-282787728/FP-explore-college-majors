6648736,5,B00NG1K2QM,A great film with all the wonderful murder mystery twists and turns. Highly recommended viewing!,1416355200,2,96,5.466666666666667
6648737,3,B00NG1K2QM,"The plot is pretty basic in that Private eye Jim Noble moves into a loft apartment in Tampa that seems to be a haven for gay men. Then one of his neighbours is found dead in the complex pool  the police think he drowned whilst intoxicated but one of his friends thinks otherwise and hires Jim to find the killer.

This then is a routine whodunit where everyone has a motive and alibis are always shaky. The acting is all pretty much above average but some am dram wannabees did make the final cut; there are no bedroom scenes but partial nudity. For an independent made on a shoe string effort it actually holds up rather well. The problem is the actual plot and it is waffer then  that is where it falls down.

This is gay themed though and as such will not be what everyone is looking for, but if you want a border line good film with some notable acting or you just want to support independent gay cinema  then give it a go.",1444435200,,927,4.214689265536723

6648742,1,B00NG1K2QM,"OUT TO KILL A FEW BRAIN CELLS would be a more descriptive title.  Why is it that gay men cannot elevate themselves when it comes to gay-themed art?  Truly, this film requires you to accept ALL stereotypes, except the one where gay men have talent.  Insipid dialogue, truly childish acting and a lack of direction are what killed this film.  And knowing one of the actors in this film doesn't even help me like it more, it makes me respect that person even less. Wow, this was worse than watching paint dry and not half as thrilling.",1435968000,3,532,4.453608247422681
6648743,4,B00NG1K2QM,"Most of the reviews of this film are so superficial, overly picky, and hypercritical that they overlook the relationship dynamics, possible clues, and fail to guess an ending that certainly redeems what is often wooden acting and the limited almost claustrophobic setting. This is not Shakespeare and should be approached on its own terms. Out To Kill takes place in a gay loft complex in Tampa.  Into this world of ""complex"" characters (pardon the pun) comes a new tenant, private investigator Jim Noble (Scott Sell). He is quickly taken under the wing of Gene Sherman (Rob Moretti), a self-appointed matchmaker and manager, and gradually introduced to a number of other occupants. One individual in particular, Justin Jaymes (Tom Goss), acts like a narcissistic queen bee who enjoys bragging about his ""pollinating"" ability. He also likes to display his anatomical attributes and persists in appearing naked in public, especially when floating in the Complex pool. (An early scene gives us a rear view shot of Justin emerging from said pool.) Needless to say, he is loathed by all (except perhaps Gene). Shortly after his initial introduction, he is found floating in the same pool dead from an apparent drug overdose. Except for a possible short lived shock, no one really cares. However, Gene does. He believes that Justin was murdered and hires Jim to investigate. There are any number of suspects owing to the past wreckage that Justin left in his wake.  At this point I must concur with those who found fault with the acting and dialogue which came across as strained and stilted at times. Nevertheless, there is a possible murder to be solved and a possible murderer still loose. For the viewer here is the fun part. If it was murder, who did it and why?  As we follow Jim's investigation, one suspect after another are eliminated. In the meantime, Jim has begun to hook up with one of the other tenants, a dentist named Vic (Mark Strano) who is sorely lacking in self esteem.  Jim's attention brings Vic out of his shell and the two are shown kissing, in bed together, and walking along the Florida coast.  Love is seemingly in bloom despite the fact that the two appear to be mismatched. The new state of bliss is suddenly interrupted when a wheelchair confined resident (laughingly referred to as the ""Rear Window"" viewer) summons Jim and Gene to his loft and tells them that he saw who killed Justin.  It was Vic the dentist!  J&G immediately rush to Vic's loft only to discover...(No ""Spoilers"" Here).  The pace of the movie now picks up and a sequence of events and revelations rapidly unfold leading to a finale that, thanks to a delicious twist, should leave the audience open mouthed.  In retrospect, we have a good murder mystery which is fully explained; a bit of eye candy depending upon one's tastes; and touches of humor along the way from various characters which can be appreciated by those willing to look past some of the exaggerated and hammy acting.  Aside from ""Rear Window"" man, we have the ""Three Steves"" (Steve, Stephen, and Steven) who live together in one of the lofts and are fun to watch, an overeager young real estate lady who makes some unintentional inappropriate yet humorous remarks, and Rob Moretti's constant flitting around like a ""mother hen"", though he means well and has a very human side.  Out To Kill is definitely not trite and the title may even be a ""double entendre"".",1435190400,2,3421,4.820819112627986
6648744,2,B00NG1K2QM,"This flaccid & thoroughly un-suspenseful murder mystery suffers from a predictable script and a completely miscast acting ensemble. Not a believable moment or person is to be found throughout the entire thing. The Florida locales are nice, though. As for eye candy, it is fine as far as it goes, but it does not belong in a murder mystery that is supposed to be taken seriously. Also,  the audience should care for the murder victim or at least one or any of the suspects, otherwise they will not be interested in any ensuing investigation that takes place afterward. For me, artifice is the true culprit here.",1428969600,2,610,4.754716981132075
6648745,3,B00NG1K2QM,"I give it 3.5 starts on a 5 star scale. The story could use a little bit more development, (I felt it needed more suspense built into the story) but it was okay enough to watch 2X and I don't mind owning a copy.

6648749,2,B00NG1K2QM,Acting is OK. This film isn't as thrilling as you'd expect for a murder mystery.  I think the writers were torn between two different genres trying to be a gay drama mixed with a detective story.,1425081600,,195,4.416666666666667

6648761,2,B00NG1K2QM,"Although the plot line has been presented many times in films (such as ""the butler did it""), this is rather a poor attempt in introducing the plot line into a gay community. The dialogue was quite stabbed in style, apparently insensitively recited from cue-cards, and emotionally disconnected from all other characters. As such the characters portraying the individual parts failed to convince, and also their inaptitude to motivate the viewers with mature acting abilities, the connection between the director and audience did not succeed. This resulted in a total lack of connection rendering the film synthetic and spurious. It can only be hoped that director Rob Williams returns to his stronger forte as witnessed in Long-Term Relationship.",1420156800,4,745,5.3760683760683765

6648763,1,B00NG1K2QM,LOL! NOPE. Try again. Everyone involved in this movie should be banned from any and all artistic endeavors for life. This was painful. I have to assume the other reviews are from people involved with the studio? Or joking?,1418169600,18,222,4.717948717948718

6648765,5,B00NG1K2QM,"Just finished watching ""Out To Kill"" released by Guest House Films.
Rob Williams wrote and directed this engrossing murder mystery that is filled with delicious twists and turns that should make it strong contender for the movie section of the Edgar Award this year.
When Jim Noble moves into his new condo in a loft complex in Tampa, Florida, he's immediately drawn into the daily lives and conficts of his new neighbors and friends.
Wanna-be singer and neighbor Justin Jaymes [played brilliantly and unabashably by singer Tom Goss] sees Noble as the next notch in the bedpost in a long line of sexual conquests sicne the passing of his husband three years ago - the Professor.
Gene Sherman's - the complex's Mrs. Kravitz and adorable matchmaker - wants to set Noble up with Jaymes, but thinks Jaymes should consider Noble for his next husband.
At a pool party, where an angry ex-lover throws a drink in his face, Jayme's does make a sex date with Noble, and also one with Vicar - the shy dentist.
The next morning, Jaymes if found floating face down in the pool.  The police think it was an accident due to an overdose of drugs the pathologist found in Jayme's body.  Both Vicar and Noble claim that they weren't at Jaymes' before he was killed and are cleared by the police.
Sherman thinks Jayme's was murdered, and since Noble said that he was a private investigator, he hires Noble to discover who murdered Jaymes.
Noble is at first very reluctant to start a murder investigation when all signs point to Jaymes having overdosed on drugs.
Yet because Sherman  was appointed the executor of Jaymes' estate he convinces Noble to investigate.  Noble soon discovers that his new home is actually a hotbed of seething tensions and hate.
With ""Out To Kill,"" Williams has crafted a crafty and ingenius murder mystery that challanges viewers out of the-oh-so-comfortable shells what we weave around ourselves.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1416960000,5,1939,4.866666666666666
6648766,5,B00NG1K2QM,Our favorite genre murder mysteries. We're pretty good at figuring out who done it. This one actually stumped us. Had to watch it a second time to pick up the clues we missed. Not like us to miss them. Very well written. Get this movie and see how well you do in figuring out the murderer.,1416873600,3,289,4.178571428571429
8677808,1,B00NG1K2QM,"This didn't deserve even one star. For a murder mystery, there was ABSOLUTELY NO SUSPENSE! The plot was very weak, and the ending made no sense. In fact most of the movie made no sense. The acting was horrible. I like supporting LGBTQ films, but this one is one you should skip.",1524614400,,278,4.365384615384615

8677811,5,B00NG1K2QM,"Have to give 'Out To Kill' 5 stars. It was no better, or no worse than straight ensemble murder mystery movies like the classic 'Murder By Death' (1976). These movies provide no more, no less than they promise - a hour or so of comic suspense; and they are so much better than TV - no commercials. Only downside is I am too good at figuring out who the real killer is.",1484006400,2,368,4.125

8677814,3,B00NG1K2QM,"This movie is a conflicted recommendation, that is a good rental/streaming viewing for the multiple flesh-candy and for handsome Scott Sell's natural performance.  This investigative murder mystery is fairly engaging with all of its paint-by-numbers plot and sophomoric writing.  Most of the performances are amateurish and the storyline is filled with fun red herrings.  I liked the conclusion with Scott Sell's character carrying mostly every scene up to its final wrap-up ending.",1462838400,,482,5.666666666666667
