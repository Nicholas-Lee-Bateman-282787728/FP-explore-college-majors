Then it goes to 2017. Reuse of dialog, reuse of scenes, recreation of scenes, scenes that honor scenes. At one point Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn could have appeared but did not. While the cover photo shows him with glasses I do not recall him with glasses during the movie.

There are some scenes of true emotion for fans of the franchise but this is unneeded and at times choppy and confusing.

It can be a little confusing at times in time travel movies but overall good plot move this series forward.  i especially liked how they incorporated arnold throughout th movie.  I did feel that the creature behind the whole event was a little hokie at the end.
I think it kind of sets it up for another one if they want to but anyone that is a terminator fan will enjoy it.  Sci fi movies have specific type followers and if you were a big fan of the others you will still not be won over in this one.
Good flick, well done",1435708800,2,560,4.0636363636363635

7296992,5,B01013C5IU,"There is no fate but what we make: A line that weve been hearing since 1984, yet its not until now, 31 years later, that a Terminator film has really embraced that line.(Well, aside from T2.)
Rebooting the Terminator franchise was a very smart idea after the horrendous train wreck that was Terminator: Salvation.(The fourth and unintentionally final film in the original Terminator film series.) Six years later, we have Terminator: Genesis(yeah, I spell it the correct way!) A film that begins as a remake of the original Terminator film, but then goes wildly off course.
Just like the original, In a future war against the machines in 2029, human resistance leader John Conner learns that the nearly defeated Terminator army has sent a Terminator back in time to the year 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah Conner, therefore stopping him from ever being born. He sends his right hand man Kyle Reese back in time to save her. Heres where Genesis starts to change the story: once Kyle gets to 1984, he discovers that somehow, Sarah has been waiting for him. Shes already a rock strong warrior who somehow already has knowledge of the future and has her own Terminator bodyguard(Played by Arnold).
Heres the really great thing about this film being a reboot; once Sarah and Arnold save Kyle in 1984, theres no more set future. The writers now have permission to do whatever they want with the story because now that the past has changed, they are building a new future. They no longer have to set up the future that weve known for the last 31 years and my God, do they take advantage of this! These are writers who have realized the full potential of changing the Terminator story and it is executed beautifully. (The rest of this paragraph does contain SPOILERS for the original 4 Terminator films. Not Genesis though.) The original series once did this. In Terminator 2, they change the future and stop Judgement Day, but then in the beginning of Terminator 3, Arnold says some idiotic BS Judgement Day is inevitable, a ludicrous statement that the writers don't even give us the courtesy of explaining. Terminator 3 and Terminator 4 do get some leeway to change the story as a result of Terminator 2, but nothing like Genesis. They still end up having to set up for the events of Terminator 1.
Anyway, back to Genesis. I got the privilege of seeing this film last night at a special 7:00 Tuesday night showing, before the film was even released, and boy I won't forget it!
Terminator: Genesis is not just a triumphant return to form for the franchise, its also an amazing movie in its own right! The film is exciting, action packed, refreshingly unpredictable, well acted, fun, funny, heartfelt, clever and packed with well developed characters. The film brings back the heart that made this series so beloved in the first place. The father-daughter relationship between Sarah and The Terminator(who she calls pops) is really great. There are a lot of funny moments that come of this, like The Terminator scholding Sarah for talking fresh to him and for not wearing a seatbelt. There are a lot of heartfelt moments too, like Sarah looking at the pictures she drew as a kid of her and her Terminator Dad and The Terminator not wanting Sarah to see that he is malfunctioning due to his age, both of which are very touching.
The film has a lot of funny moments. The scene when the police process Kyle, Sarah and Pops is hands down the funniest scene in the whole 31 year old franchise!(With Bad Boys playing in the background. Hahaha.)
Jason Clarke gives a very strong performance as John Conner. Hes the best actor to ever play the character. Emilia Clark and Jai Courtney also give great performances as Sarah and Kyle.
Also, theres actually a lot of stuff that wasn't shown in the trailer. Yeah sure, they could have gone without revealing the John Conner plot twist, but there really is a lot more cool stuff that happens that you don't see in the trailers. Theres a lot more layers to the story than you would think.
If theres any downside to this film, it's that its so confusing, even if your a fan of the franchise! Also, its much darker than the other ones, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.
(The rest of this review does contain SPOILERS)
Something that Sarah struggles with throughout the film is that, since she knows the future, she needs to make sure the future happens exactly like its supposed to. She cant make her own choices in life. She needs to stay on this path that has been laid out for her or else the future will be changed. As the film ends with Skynet and Genesis being destroyed(possibly?) and Sarah and Kyle getting to start a life together, with Pops at their side, Sarah rejoices that she is finally free and she can finally decide what she wants to do with her life. I feel like this series now has that same liberation. Theres an open road ahead. They can honestly do whatever they want with the next two films in this new trilogy. In no way, shape or form do they have to set up for the apocalypse future that we all know. For the first real time in this series: There is no fate, but what we make.""",1435708800,144,5135,4.594771241830065

7296996,5,B01013C5IU,"This movie is as complex as a time travel movie deserves to be, and yet none of the previous Terminator movies have been. Which is of course why many dislike it. The only true faults, were the studio giving away the final act plot twist in the previews, and of course their general marketing trying to assign stupid numbers to everything as if the plot of this movie was selling action figures...

As a fan of subtlety, my favorite character was Alex (Doctor Who's Matt Smith), basically Lancelot to John Conner's (Jason Clarke) King Author. Taking the role of Galahad is Kyle Reese (Suicide Squad's Jai Courtney), whom is oft confused protagonist. Lee Byung-hun's terminator had a charisma unexpected, allowing him to serve both as Rabbit and Beast of Caerbannog (sadly there is no Holy Hand Grenade to help the knights this time).

Jokes aside, the way time travel works in this movie is quite simply that all time travel in the interceding years is valid, as is later time travel to deal with your success or failure... We get to see more or less a final iteration, which is a crazy hot mess, but a fun one!",1531785600,,1110,4.601010101010101

7297009,3,B01013C5IU,"MOSTLY-OK

Pretty much everything about this movie is ok. The effects are ok. The acting is ok (except for Emilia Clarke). The plot is ok. The action ..................... ok. The most disappointing aspect about this movie is in the plot, and how unoriginal it feels. In fact, the first 20ish minutes of this movie are basically plot points that the audience should be familiar with, if they're hardcore fans of the other Terminator movies, which is essentially the majority of the people still watching these movies. It begins talking about the war with the Terminators, and how Kyle Reese (played by Jai Courtney) traveled back in time, setting up the events of the first movie. Before discussing the outcome of this, and my overall opinion on this, I want to talk about the portrayal of the Terminators in the opening scene, because it seems to be a tradition in all of these movies to show the apocalypse, and what it looks like.

The Opening
  In the first two movies, there seems to be some sort of emotional reason to show the end of the world, to raise the stakes for the protagonists, and inform the audience on what will happen if they fail to defeat the Terminators sent through time. However, in this movie, there seems to be no logical reason to have this in there, except to make it longer than 2 hours. In addition, the Terminators are MUCH MUCH MORE easily defeated in this movie than in any of the other movies. Oh well.

The Plot (SPOILERS)
  After Kyle gets sent back in time, the movie pretty much loses all sense of its continuity, and doesn't remember the events of the second, third, and fourth movies (Didn't they completely destroy Skynet without all the time machines in the fourth one) at all. For example, now there's a liquid metal Terminator sent back, at the same time that Arnold was sent back. But in the previous scene, the movie only showed Arnie being sent back, not the guy who was Storm Shadow from the GI Joe movies........... Moving on. Reminder --- SPOILERS. Sarah rescues Kyle Reese from the Storm Shadow terminator, and then explains to him that the timeline was changed, but never how she knows this. That's the biggest problem with the plot, it's explained terribly: the movie never says how Sarah knows the original events of the first two movies, because she constantly references those movies. It is suggested that the good Arnold terminator knows all this, so possibly he told her, but who sent him back? Of course, the movie never explains this either, because it might be explained in the next sequel that nobody is going to watch. Then (REMINDER SPOILERS), it is shown that John Connor, the leader of the Resistance, the supposedly most knowledgeable character in terms of knowing how Terminators work, their behavior, and tactics, is now a Terminator. And, rather than send him to kill Sarah as a kid, or to kill her parents as kids so that she wouldnt be born, the robots decide to send John to only a couple of years before when Sarah and Kyle want to travel to. Why doesn't the dude who made John Connor a Terminator just make more human terminators and send them back, since Connor is portrayed as near unbeatable, and is so arbitrarily defeated anyways? Instead, the Doctor Who guy decides to send one terminator, only to program Skynet now renamed Genisys, which he could have done in the first place. Moving on.

The Acting
  In my opinion, there isn't much to complain about in terms of the acting, excluding Sarah Connor and Jai Courtney, because the best character from the 2nd and 3rd movie is also the best character in this movie, and that is the T-800. It seemed that after T4, there wasn't anything left with the T-800 character, in terms of personality, and despite the worries about whether he would be good as this character, he played the part well. JK Simmons plays a character who knew Sarah and John, and is aware of the time travel aspect of the movie, and, while entertaining, does not play any role in the plot whatsoever, and therefore feels wasted. The guy playing John Connor was ok, he wasn't that good, but there's not anything that unique about his portrayal. Captain Boomerang is also.................... ok, but he never felt like Kyle Reese, in any scene at all, so that's something to worry about. The girl from Game of Thrones is........................................................................ not-good. She basically has the same facial expressions throughout the movie, and never looks scared at all in it, so she doesn't sell the potential horror aspect that the other Sarah Connor did in the first two movies. Whenever she gets mad, it looks like she's about to start crying, and the same with whenever she gets worried, which is........................................................................................................................... dumb.

The Effects
  Meh. There's nothing that memorable in the effects or the action scenes, mostly because they don't make that much sense. For example, the T-3000 has many ways to incorporate its BS nanobots, or whatever, to effectively ""terminate"" targets, but rather than use this new idea to impress the audience, the T-3000 simply shoots at the heros, or by attempts to defeat Arnie through hand-to-hand combat(????), excluding the last action sequence. Oh well.
  I could see this movie being a least favorite of a long-term Terminator fan, or even a least favorite of a long-term action fan (????), but personally, the worst one is still T3. The problems with T5 are in the forgettable action sequences, and the confusing plot, but if you haven't see any Terminator film ever, I would sorta recommend it as long as you don't expect anything exceptional.",1529712000,,5716,4.921079958463136

7297052,2,B01013C5IU,"Not great. On the one hand, I always wanted the scene where John sent Kyle back to be fleshed out. Imagine how it would feel to send your father and friend to certain death AND you could never tell him you were his son. Indeed, he would never know.  That is a scene that deserves some thought. This movie made a decent attempt at it. At first it started out strong. But: then it went off the rails.
(1) Arnold had no legitimate role here. He was literally shoe horned into a movie that had very little reason for him. I could literally see the studio executive forcing him into the story.  Also, he was straight up horrible. Either he got rusty or I am over him. Nothing lovable about this good terminator.
(2) Kyle was not the same character from the first movie. That guy was a person who grew up eating rats and watching everyone he knew be killed. He wasn't pudgy; he didn't make jokes; and he went back in time because all he had in life was a photo of Sarah. Here Jai Courtney was just NOT THAT GUY. It was too distracting.
(3) Assuming that I would be ok with John Connor being killed right after he sent Kyle through, am I seriously supposed to be ok with him being turned into a terminator? Nope nope nope. That isn't he story, John wins and everything comes back. That is the story I know.. that is the story I want to see, forever more.. got it.
(4) Time travel. If Back to the Future II taught us anything using it too much in one movie ruins things.
(5) Here we go again for about the 20th time... we do X to stop judgment day. But what is the point. Judgment day will eventually come, as it always does. They never seem to be able to do something in the time line to make any one of these AI people put in a kill switch that automatically gets triggered under certain constraints... or what ever. Why do they always think if they blow up the cyberdine building another just won't be built in 10 years?
(6) Amelia Clark was ok but in no way captured the idea of Sarah Connor even the young and nieve Sarah Connor.  You just can't cast that way.",1519084800,,2057,4.1893939393939394

7297075,4,B01013C5IU,"I happen to like Terminator films, even those without Schwarzenegger; this should be kept in mind.
How the film is regarded depends on how it is interpreted:
-- taken as a reboot, it uses an interesting approach to accounting for an actor who is, let's face it, a bit older than he was in the original, in a role that would, one would think, require him to look exactly the same; this leads to many other changes
-- taken as part of a series, it shows yet another change in the timeline; this shouldn't be unexpected: the actual, original date of Judgement Day is in doubt -- yes, the second film gave a date, but that was with part of the first terminator to inspire the technology; without that boost, who knows how long it would have taken?

7297081,3,B01013C5IU,Not nearly as bad as some people say but not even close to as good as any of the original trilogy.  This soft reboot of the franchise does fail in part due to not finding convincing leads.  Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke might be an IT girl but she wasn't cut out for the role of a young Sarah Connor.  Jai Courtney does a better job as a young Kyle Reese but the hackneyed script forcing these soon-to-be lovers together doesnt do them any favors.  Arnolds T-800 is showing its wear and tear and though hes iconic to the franchise it would be best for him to only come back in guest spots in future installments (or just CGI him in).,1513987200,2,638,4.204918032786885

7297103,4,B01013C5IU,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is now back as the terminator, and i loved it! He still knows how to play
our favorite machine surrounded by living tissue. Plus I love how they used the concept of putting
Arnold's face onto the evil / younger terminator in this film like they did in Salvation. Emile Clarke
is no Linda Hamilton, but she sure pulled-off Sarah Connor perfectly! She was strong and very
determined to stop the evil Skynet from ruling the world! Jai Courtney was awesome as Kyle
Reese! Jason Clarke was no Christian Bale, but for the most part, he was great as John Connor!
My only objection to this movie is that John Connor is suppose to be the good guy, and I don't think
that making him into an evil terminator was a good idea. Although it was a great idea for a
new terminator (T-3000), it would have been better if they had John struggling internally with his
humanity (as an early concept for John Connor's character had) and eventually came around in
the end,... kind of like Optimus Prime did in Transformers: The Last Knight. Back to the plus
side: The visual effects were awesome! The battle / action sequences were well done! The plot
basically took the first two Terminator movies and twisted them together with a bunch of new
concepts to add to the Terminator universe. J.K. Simmons ( famous for playing J. Jonah
Jameson in the first three Spider-Man movies) was a nice edition to the cast as the cop.
And 'Storm Shadow' as the new T-1000 was a great choice in casting, and I wish they used him
a little more than they did. Overall, I am a big Terminator fan, and I though this movie was great!
I didn't expect much out of it when I first saw it in theaters, but I ended up loving it! A recommended
flick!",1511395200,,1723,4.438485804416404

I grew up watching a simpleton white women who grew into strong but emotional role sharing the lead.  The funny thing is the movie is now in the same action role as fast and furious and the story is overcomplex and loopey.  With clique action lines after what the director thinks is an ""action packed"" scene.  Just terrible.  Also no drama is the sound department.  What happened to the stanley kubrick sound effects that ramp up major drama with instruments in todays movies ?  those days are gone.  Terminator 1 and 2 did a great job with the simple but incredibly cliff hanger sound effects.  Hollywood today is making movies for a global market so we are seeing the watering down of cult classics like we had in the 80's, 90's and even early 2000's.  The product is just stale.

Two things I liked in the movie: old Arnold fighting young Arnold (thank you CGI!) and his creepy version of a terminator smile. But there's more. Some twists like the acid bath to terminate the T1000. On the other hand I think the premise of John Connor could have been better. But what the heck - it's an escape movie that takes the kind of alternate universe like twist that can be expected from a time travel based story.

And, at the end of it all, there is skynet coming back to life - shudder, get ready for another reboot. The terminator is the franchise that will not terminate!

Because the story has become so predictable I'm dropping only one star. There is still a lot of action filled chases, shooting, fire and explosions and plenty of good special effects.

After that, the story does take some odd turns, the performances are not amazing, but it's a fun ride. I enjoyed it, and am disappointed that the story will not be concluded.

The whole plot twist changing what we initially thought would just turn into a remake of the original, into something more dynamic and functional worked well. The storyline with Arnold having to go ""the long way"" through time played perfectly into Arnolds older appearance so it made it perfectly feasible as to why there was an older terminator.

The main enemy robot was another good twist and evolutionarily feasible. And the whole genesys/skynet thing was very topical of today's tech giants so it was relatable.

The comic relief was subtle without being too corny. Especially liked the ""I'll be back"" response and momentary T2 theme clip giving a proper nod.

Now, did I like it? Well, I'd say so. It was entertaining, action-packed, and seeing the new gimmicky Terminator they cooked up for this movie was entertaining. The plot line is....well it's kinda followable. It can be pretty mind-bendy, as this time travel plot really mixes it up, so make sure you're familiar with your Terminator lore before dropping into this one.

The actors seemed to be...okay. The main characters just seemed really awkward and if that's just due to the characters it's one thing...but it just kinda felt like it was more on the actors' side - well, except for Arnold, he doesn't disappoint as the old-but-not-obsolete T-101. The music was...forgettable, with NO use of the Terminator theme. You guys really terminated a great musical opportunity there. I mean the music wasn't bad...but you won't be humming anything from this movie anytime soon. The action was nice though - expect to see a lot of things blow up good. The CGI was really neat too - it's almost as if the Terminator films were made for these kinds of graphics, and the effects of the T-3000 are brilliant, especially during the final battle against the 101.

Is it a bad movie? Nah. It's a serviceable action flick. Is it a bad Terminator movie? As a fan of the series, it's definitely better than Salvation. And has more eye candy than T3. On a 5 average scale, I'd give it a 7/10. So a little bit above average for me. If you're a Terminator fan, check it out, but do yourself a favor and don't set the expectations up too high. It seems like they were trying some things out with this one, and there were some hits, some misses...so let's see if the next film in this new go can prove better.",1501632000,,1882,4.562130177514793

7297197,2,B01013C5IU,"I enjoyed all the original Terminator movies.  Even the bad ones.  This movie was pretty terrible.

The plot made no sense and was clearly just stitching to hold the action scenes together.  I'm very forgiving of sci-fi and time travel movies.  Nobody watches these expecting a Stephen Hawking level dissertation on particle physics.  But I do expect the plot to at least make sense.  Tons of contradictions made many character choices nonsensical.  They wanted to string together action scenes, so they got you there however they could whether it made sense or not.  It was like someone had just finished watching Sharknado and decided they should use those same epic plot strategies in a Terminator movie.  They seemed to be wanting to justify a ""reboot"" that still worked alongside all the other Terminator movies, but that did not work out at all, and they probably should have stuck with just remaking the first movie.

The dialogue is pretty bad.  There are plenty of attempts to be witty, but they aren't funny or clever.  They might have worked back in the 80s when the first Terminator movie was made.  The movie is loaded with references to the other Terminator movies as well as other Schwarzenegger movies.  I thought it was kind of clever when it first happened, but after about the eighteenth reference or so, it was just disruptive. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke do as good a job as they can given the script.  Jason Clarke can't fight the overwhelming sucking force of the script, though, and ends up being completely wooden and flat.  I'd be interested to see what he could do in a better movie.  Every primary character in this movie deserves to be in a better one.

The CGI is done pretty well for the most part and used judiciously.  It enhanced some of the action scenes without being over the top.  Nothing particularly innovative, here, but whoever was working that angle for the fight scenes had an eye for not going crazy with it while still doing some cool things.

There is no reason to watch this movie unless you just like seeing Emilia Clarke or Arnold Schwarzenegger on screen.  It does succeed in doing that.  Everything else was like it was written by a fifth grader who watched the other Terminator movies back to back and instructed to write a script that was ""just like the other movies, but funnier and with more time travel,"" and this is what their brain produced.  Just a mishmashed, chaotic hash of past stuff that made no sense with some cool CGI-enhanced fight scenes and a couple of good actors trying their very best to make something at least salvageable out of it.",1499212800,3,2620,4.71806167400881

Wrong. The trailer is the entire film from beginning to end. There are no surprises left after watching all trailers and tv spots.

This film had too many bad things going against it. The writer was too long winded. The director must of thinking this film was for kids. The music score was just lame.

The cast was good. The acting was average. I felt like the first half of the movie was introductions.

A terminator movie should make you be leave we all are going to die. Not this one. You feel like the threat is on TV and you are very safe. Too bad. The movie had great possibilities but someone else needed to make that happen.

7297221,4,B01013C5IU,"*Warning: contains spoilers*

Terminator: Genisys was not terribly well received and the criticisms are clear when you watch the film; the film is longer than it needs to be, disorganized, and the narrative arc seems almost lost. The time travel elements are either non-sensical, or, if sense can be made of them, they ignore much of how time travel was supposed to have worked in the other films. For example, in T2, Arnold's character sacrifices himself in order to prevent the possibility of anyone discovering terminator technology. In Genisys, Arnold's character (a different terminator) lives through the ending and yet we're supposed to believe that the future apocalypse has been prevented. Some viewers may be disapppointed that, after several films spent trying to save John Connor, we now spend an entire film trying to kill John Connor. And, so, there are various technical problems with the film's execution and logic; I suspect these irritated critics and inspired many of the critical reviews..(Nonetheless, we are treated to a much-needed explanation as to why Arnold's various terminators differed in age, filling a plot gap left in a number of other films in the series.)

The film has two saving graces.

First, the performances delivered by the actors, including Emilia Clarke's young Sarah Connor, and her chemistry with co-star Jai Courtney. Clarke does not look like a young Linda Hamilton and Courtney does not resemble young Michael Biehn, but their performances, and pairing, works.

The second saving grace: the artistic representation of the future apocalypse. I was disapointed with Terminator: Salvation for several reasons, but my biggest disappointment was that we were not treated to the dystopian future depicted in short sequences in the two original films. I grew up with the dystopian sequences in T1&2 and always wanted a film-length depiction. I thought Salvation would be that film, but Salvation turned out to depict a very different looking future. Fans of the series will be quick to point out that Salvation was set in a different time line than the dystopian sequences in the other films, and, while that may make sense in terms of the series' internal logic, I still left Salvation disappointed and wanting a different film.* Genisys is not a feature length treatment of the future dystopia, but has considerably longer sequences set in the future than T1&2. Moreover, the future dystopia is direclty modeled after the future sequences in T1&2. And so the film satisfied my aesthetic tastes.

Genisys is not perfect and I cannot rate the film a full five stars, but I found Genisys deeply satisfying. 4/5

--------------------

*I was also disapointed with Salvation for another reason altogether: I expected Salvation to be a dark, high cinema reinterpretation of the Terminator franchise, ala Christopher Nolan's Batman. Terminator's future dystopia has always promised that possibility; dystopian sequences feature themes of genocide and allusions to the holocaust. Nonetheless, Salvation did not live up to that expectation. Still, I can't necessarily fault Salvation for failing to live up to my idiosyncratic expectations.",1495929600,,3174,5.298210735586481

7297223,2,B01013C5IU,"Finally got around to watching this. I thought it was WAY better than Salvation. The biggest issue was the unexplained time travel change the movie even directly addressed when Terminator John asks ""who sent you back?"" I am sure the post-credit scene, hinting at a living Skynet, was the setup for the sequel and then we'd find out, but as of now it looks like we will never know. There is also the complete lack of explanation for the T-1000 going back. And, of course, how the doctor can remember a past that never happened since they jumped to 2017 before the police station shootout in 1984 (and also, I'm assuming, erasing T2 events). Also, how they built a time machine in 1984 but not 2017. Okay, the more I type, the more holes I am finding, so I'll just stop now and say it wasn't great but it was a good movie to watch while doing laundry.",1495756800,,849,4.379746835443038

7297226,2,B01013C5IU,"SPOILER ALERT

Terminator Genisys is apparently an attempt to reboot the Terminator franchise.  You know you're in trouble when the best ""acting"" is by Arnold Schwarzenneger as good old wooden T-1 (here called ""Pops,"" I kid you not).  In the sort-of ""plot"" John Connor (Jason Clarke) -- leader of the human resistance against Skynet -- sends his best friend Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in time to save his mother Sarah (Emilia Clarke) from a Terrminator (also Ahnold) sent to kill her and prevent her from destroying Skynet (now Genysis) before it takes over the planet.

In an effort to create a backstory to justify the reboot, there are now different timelines that -- of course -- allow different Terminators to try and do their ""destroy the world"" thing.  Conveniently, this allows just about any character to be (GASP) revealed as a Terminator.  If you can't figure out which ""human"" is revealed as a 'nator, you've fallen asleep.  The whole thing would make more sense as a Wayans Brothers parody.  ""BUUUUUT WAIIIIT . . . there's ANOTHER 'nator!!!""

The acting's pretty awful.  Clarke's Sarah Connor is written more as a Valley Girl than a warrior, Courtney is as mechanical as a 'nator even though he isn't one, and J.K. Simmons is completely wasted here.  ""BUUUTTTT WAAIIITTT . . . there's a sequel coming . . .""  Make. It. Stop.",1495584000,3,1341,4.807860262008734

They should have just remastered the original two movies slapped together and give the fans a more polished version without trying hard to rewrite the franchise and completely butcher it towards the end. Weak director, fast moving events, poor character story lines (not only stick to original character portrayal but further try to create something new with elements of old characters making them completely bland) and breaking of the movie's own rules not to mention rules of physics (helicopter flight, time travel) makes this movie average.

7297313,3,B01013C5IU,"Spoilers included: There were parts that were interesting, and there were the parts that just about took the movie down. It truly helped that it was free with Prime, I would have been very unhappy to have paid for it.
Casting and character development (or lack thereof) - HORRIBLE! The characters of Sarah, Kyle and John completely missed the mark. Sarah was bad ass even in the first movie as she learned what she could do when necessary. This Sarah was tepid and uninspired. Kyle was a soldier first and foremost, not a love-sick puppy following along after Sarah as he did in this movie. John is referred to in all the movies as tough, making the tough decisions, battle scarred - a warrior. Here's he's a GQ pyscho. And the actors they chose for these roles just came across as bland - no charisma, no spark, nothing. The actors playing Sarah and Kyle were especially bad choices.
They defeated the liquid-metal terminators so very easily which is not in keeping with previous movies.
The whole, ""I heard these things from an alternate time line when I was in the time machine,"" to give them the advantage - bad plot device. The whole plot was just weird and ridiculous.
However, I love Terminator, and Arnold, as old as he is, is still hanging in there, so I couldn't give it a one star. I loved his totally freaky grin - that alone upped my rating. The nostalgia factor also kicked it up a bit from a 1 star rating.
For a cold and windy winter evening it was mindless fun, but I'll probably never watch it again, unlike T1 and T2 which I have seen numerous times each.",1486944000,17,1574,4.46875

The only duds are T3 (Kristanna Loken (great casting choice) and Arnold were fine, but Nick Stahl was terrible, along with certain dragged out scenes like the Pet Clinic and the end scene) and T4 (esp. T4, Christian Bale was terrible.)

I hope Paramount makes Genisys 2 and 3.

This makes for interesting action and philosophical sequences of how one dimension of time influences another dimension of time.  The first part of the movie retains this peak interest all the way to the 3/4's of the movie.  Although the end of ok, it is the ending that becomes weaker in its writing.  By the way, good ol Arnold looks exactly like that:  old.  At times, I couldn't accept this since I am used to seeing Schwarzenegger as more robust and younger looking.  So at times, this thing about Arnold was barely acceptable.  In the end, is the movie worth watching?  Yes it is.

It's probably the best of the Terminator flicks to come after Judgement Day but that's still not saying much.
I enjoyed the way it played with the changing timeline and worked on moments from earlier films but outside that it's pretty mundane stuff. Ultimately it was kind of boring which is a pretty big sin for an action flick
Still, not the worst couple of hrs in front of the tube. Pretty darn far from the best though.

If you look back at the other films, you will notice that the enemies get stronger that the old T-800, so it just seemed logical to make John Connor the main antagonist. What really keeps this movie from greatness is the root of the Terminator series. The Terminator was a cyber-punk slasher film that was genuinely scary at times. The Endoskeleton scene at the end of the first one still gives me chills, as well as the bleak and horrible future. Every other film fails to deliver that sense of fear and dread into the audience; it's all replaced with action in hopes that each entry becomes more of a thrill ride rather than to deliver a warning that humans can and will be destroyed by their own hands. I urge everyone who reads this to go back and really watch the first Terminator film.

The whole time, I never felt like anything was at stake. The winks to the original Terminator just reminded me that I was not watching the original Terminator and it lacked the absolute dread of the original. Additionally, continuity of the franchise was adhered to in some aspects yet thrown out the window in others. The characters dialogue and actions/reactions were silly, too. Reese's reaction to seeing 'Pops' (*groan at that freaking nickname) was over the top and ridiculous. Put this one on the shelf. Worst yet of the franchise.",1486598400,5,797,4.659574468085107

It's a pretty good movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-800 and new actors filling out the iconic roles of Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor, but if you're expecting anything in this movie to make any sense, you might as well forget it because it's going to make your head hurt.

The story honors the larger plot of the ""Connors"" vs Skynet. If you like Terminator Series you should like this. If you are a snob you'll probably give it a 2 or 3 (which is totally fine). Its not perfect but its good if you like these types of movies.",1486339200,,383,4.1891891891891895

Furthermore, if you're a fan time-travel, and all the complexities that arise from it, you will probably enjoy this story. Genisys, by far, has the heaviest emphasis on time-travel compared to the other Terminator films. That being said, this movie single-handedly erases all previous Terminator plots, essentially making Genisys the only relevant story-line in the entire saga. That was a bit disappointing, as the previous Terminator movies (particularly 1 and 2) were phenomenal.",1486339200,,563,5.482758620689655

7297679,4,B01013C5IU,"It is worth the time to watch as entertainment. Humans get stuck on a series and will instantly kneejerk when something isn't as they remember it or something changed.

Me? i watch movies as a movie, entertainment, whether series or a one of. it doesn't matter as long as the movie is entertaining and wastes my time in an entertaining manner, after all, entertainment is a waste of time and just there to leave reality for a bit and fill our Human lives with something other than reality, which is why we all go to the movies or rent or buy them.

So take movies as a one at a time thing, you will go through life a bit easier not needing to stand on your soapbox and point out something you have no control over and the one thing you do...that is do something constructive instead of wasting your time entertaining yourself with movies.

Summary....the movie was worth the waste of my time. It was entertaining.",1485302400,,913,4.455089820359281

Was this movie perfect? Far from it.  Did it answer any questions? Not really.  Is it as bad as T3? No, actually better.  If you can get off the high horse and just enjoy a movie, especially if you are an actual fan, then you should be entertained by this as an action flick, and a decent edition to the franchise.",1485043200,,840,4.415584415584416

The special effects of the original terminator was poor but hey, Arnold isn't as young as he was then.  It looked like they tried to put a CG Arnold face on the body of an actor with a similar build.

There was a lot of attempts to mix comedy with action in this movie.  It reminded me of the movie True Lies but was nowhere near as successful.

Having said that, I have to say that I really enjoyed Terminator Genisys, for several reasons. First of all, the decision to go back into the world of the original film was a good one, and the recreated scenes were done well. The moment when Pops confronts the young Arnold Terminator really sets things in motion and prefaces the notion that the Timelines are really screwed up now... The film is a fun ride, a little messy and complicated, but not so much that it kills the momentum of the film. There are a few nice plot twists and surprises, and the Special Effects are great.

I gave it two stars because maybe, just maybe, if you have never seen a Terminator movie before this one, you might be intrigued enough to go and watch the originals. Then again, if you think that Genisys is a good movie, you may have never seen a good movie and/or lack the judgment needed to appreciate the originals.",1484352000,,482,4.3076923076923075

This is one of the best sequels of the original Sarah & Kyle story... This one should follow T1/T2 -- the other T movies were painful to watch and didn't do the story line any justice.

Arnold actually did a great job!  He might have been wearing a full body girdle to look firm but we didn't care! His character also has some funny lines and they poke a little fun at themselves and the Terminator franchise.  Couldn't help thinking of Google as the story line has them promoting this new program to help with all aspects of human life called Genisys.  I will let you all decide that though!,1484092800,,563,4.61

7298080,2,B01013C5IU,"Wow, this really sucked. Not as bad as Terminator: Salvation but bad enough that I'm thankful I didn't pay money at the theater to see it. Let's start with the casting. The problem starts with Sarah Connor played by Emilia Clarke. Okay, I get it, I get it. Everyone loves Emilia as  Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones but you know what, she doesn't have the screen presence to pull off Sarah Connor. She's simply not...strong enough on screen to make her version of Sarah Connor believable.  Really, go back and watch Terminator II and she how Linda Hamilton owned that role. She was weak, clumsy and clueless in Terminator and rightfully so. In Terminator II, she was buff, combat ready, quick to pull the trigger and a little crazy. Linda Hamilton IS Sarah Connor and seeing her in T2 will make you a believer, just like Carrie Fisher will always be Princess Leia. Emilia Clark tried, I'll give her that but, nope...not good enough.

*I'll skip key details in this write up to avoid as many spoilers as possible.

Then there's Kyle Reese played by Jai Courtney. I was never a big Jai Courtney fan. You know there's a problem when you're watching and not liking Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher but you're actually rooting for him to win the fight at the end against Jai Courtney because you dislike his acting even more. Jai takes the character that Michael Beihn made classic and basically turns him into a typical, boring meathead. To be fair, the script is to blame as well but I've seen Jai phone it in with other performances. You're not getting anything worth sitting through here.

 Part of the problem is, there was no urgency in this film, no real sense of danger or even a possibility of failure. I understand the concept of timelines and nexus points etc, but in the first 30 minutes you can see the film is going reek of smelly lameness when a T-800 AND a T-1000 are destroyed in record time. Far too many ""Come on now"" moments. Terminator and Terminator II were part horror films because of the ONE question of...how do we kill this thing? That's not really the case here as the Johnny Terminator isn't even the main threat and he's actually not trying to kill Sarah and Kyle, he wants them to join up with him and become the happy Terminator death dealing family. No joke. That's actually in the movie. Anyways... A 50 caliber sniper rifle is as powerful as all get out but these are frickin Terminators we're talking about. T-800 class that can withstand high ballistics and laser guns are needed to put them down in the future, yet 1984 T-800 gets owned with one shot with a 50 cal? Not even a rail gun but a 50? Other details that don't hold up in the current era, why are Terminators punching each other in the face? Think about that for a second...I'm a T-800 with a combat chassis built to withstand front line futuristic combat and my first thought is...to punch the other T-800 guy in the face? Throw it across the room? What happened to all of those detailed files of the human anatomy that's supposed to make Terminators such bad azz killing machines? Where's the data files on fight techniques? I ask because throughout the entire film, the fighting was stupid.  Typical hollywood flailing about. Yes, I know Arnold is old and he can't duke it out onscreen like he used to in the Conan days but guys...really...Terminators should be better than bar room brawlers. The Rousey/Nunez fight shouldn't be more entertaining than this.

Speaking of Arnold Schwarzenegger, other than the lame fighting, Terminator ""Pops"" gives a predictable performance. Again, the script sucked but what can you do with a Arnold T-800 Terminator that you haven't already done over 30 years and 31/2 films? The reality is, the Terminator story of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese is played out. The best telling of that story was in 1984 in the original Terminator. Terminator II wasn't as good as the original but it was still good and the story should have ended there if James Cameron wasn't at the helm. Terminator III was pointless. Terminator: Salvation was a Transformer movie featuring Batman. Terminator: Genisys tries to get creative in pushing the series forward but fails because it tries to flesh out Sarah and Kyle by removing John, answering questions no one asked and no one cares about.

Basically, to push Terminator forward, the director/writers/studio should have done what Jame Cameron showed us in the first 5 minutes of Terminator II. Give us a Terminator in the future. Show us the war against the machines. Forget this time travel jargon. Been there and done that. We needed to see first hand John's fight with the resistance and how they take actually get to the point of taking down SkyNet. Not that Christian Bale, Transformers nonsense either.",1483920000,5,4766,4.698203592814371

There is some very familiar territory covered in the opening of the film, but that is subverted by a clever spin on the basis for the original movie with the subsequent Terminator versions appearing throughout.  The latest Terminator variant to pursue Sarah Conner and her protector from the future Reese is a nice addition to the expanding and rebooting Terminator universe.

7298272,1,B01013C5IU,Another example of a movie that is overwhelming in special effects and fight scenes but poor in plot. I think they made up the plot as they went along. More political correctness with a strong female and clueless white guy. Don't recommend.,1483401600,,240,4.738095238095238

Obviously not big on plot (duh), but huge on action and special effects (duh #2), so much so that I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end, with the occasional ""Back to the Future"" moment of  chronological ""what the heck?"" They also explained the elderly-looking terminator early on, so I could watch the rest of the movie without THAT running through my head.  Worth watching, but they should probably terminate this movie franchise now. Of course they could make a TV series...",1483401600,,542,4.945054945054945

There's too many references to other timelines (the other movies) and it got to the point that I didn't care anymore, just end it already. I skipped a lot. Glad it's over. Arnold really needs to move on as well. This didn't do anything for his career, such as it is.

7298299,5,B01013C5IU,I liked this movie a lot because of the manipulation of everything that happened in the original Terminator movie.  I've been a follower of Terminator since the beginning and it really hit my funny bone.  I thought it certainly had the drama of all of the other Terminator movies and I liked the twists and turns of fate.  Arnold was certainly funny as well.,1483315200,,358,4.5625

The actor playing Kyle Rhys just didn't fit; the last one in Judgment Day seemed more in line with the original Kyle Rhys from T1.

I love the old Terminator movies, but the kind of plot leaps and twists they tried to make with this story just don't work. The whole story restarts itself 4 times, and it's just more of this ""futuristic, time loop, let's make sense of this ridiculous plot"" which just ends up being stupid. Tried too hard.

7298492,2,B01013C5IU,"Arnold plays the entire movie like it's a comedy, and it practically is. I gave it two stars for some of the special effects. The worst thing about this movie is the casting of John Connor. The guy is just plain wrong for the part. They should have cast someone more likeable. The second worst thing about the movie is the casting of the guy who plays Reece. He looks nothing like the original guy and plays the part nothing like the original. You may think this is no big deal, but they reenact the beginning of the first movie! Now Reece is a dude who cracks jokes to Sarah Connor? He is supposed to be a post apocalyptic soldier. And then there is the super villain. Skynet's predecessor is a phone app called genisys which is represented in the form of a hologram 10 year old girl.  And, of course we are being chased by a terminator whose weakness is.... Magnets.",1482710400,,868,4.3580246913580245

I've seen one too many large sets explode. I've become desensitized to automatic weapon fire. I've lost patience with pointless and un-winnable fist-fights between demigods and futuristic androids.

I loved the original Terminator even with its now-dated special effects. I enjoyed the sequel because I'd never seen ""liquid metal"" effects in a movie (True, we did see the aquatic version in The Abyss). I was even engrossed in the first 10-15 minutes of this movie. Then sadly, it dissolved into typical action fare with none of the weight or sense of impending doom that its predecessors carried.

Did you make it past Part 3 of the Pirates of the Caribbean? Yes? Then Terminator Genesis this might be worth 2 hours of your time.  If not, and you are craving robots, check out Ex Machina.",1482624000,,1006,4.8313953488372094

7298646,4,B01013C5IU,I think the casting could have been better but the overall plot was well done. The Terminator movies find relevance again and again as technology moves ahead. The theme fit perfectly into our present day culture of fusing technology with social interaction and where it could lead us. The special effects and action sequences are there and thrilling as always.,1482278400,,360,5.016666666666667

The production team behind the CGI and action related scenes has never failed to push the boundaries of what their world can produce on a scale in which was previously unfathomable.

I liked the twists they included with the alternate timelines, although the melding of John Conner's biology with terminator parts is a bit out there.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was not the only one with familiar lines that were still good for more mileage from this franchise.  In her first scene as she is introduced emerging from a chaotic explosion (is there any other kind?) Emilia Clarke is able to produce, and otherwise deliver the goods on keeping the aspects that are the character of Sarah Conner as real as it gets.  Her interaction with Schwarzenegger and Jai Courtney are what this film focuses on, and actually helps carry the film beyond what we are used to seeing in sci fi and adventure films...lots of high production explosions and things of that nature.

Could some things be done better?  i personally think if any part of John transferred he would have acted differently, but that is my opinion.  The actions scenes were well done.  No complaints there.  This seemed to be the denouement of the movie, i.e., this is the last.  That's probably good as sometimes series go too long.

7298831,3,B01013C5IU,"i like Emilia Clarke, but not for this role playing Sarah, and i wish some other actors played Kyle Reese's and John Connor's roles. The time-travel premise makes for a good excuse for impossible things to happen - even for changing the entire original plot of the first Terminator film. How i wish it have stopped Arnold from aging, he's the only ingredient needed to make this superb concept work again. Sadly, that won't happen and while the movie fails to excite me, at least i got entertained by Schwarzenegger's awkward grin.

I find it silly, though, to use and re-use old cliches like 'Come with me if you wanna live', 'I'll be back' and bringing in an Asian T-1000. It was awesome when they first did it/said it/used it. Reprising them just to make a connection with the audience (and the earlier films that made these cliches famous) does not work, at least for me.

7298837,3,B01013C5IU,"The only redeeming part of this sequel is the return of Arnold as the Terminator. About half way through the movie your brain starts to fry trying to keep up with all the time line crosses.
I have never really liked movies that deal with time because they always prove to be impossible with the whole ""Grandfather Theory"". You know, go back and kill your grandfather before he meets your grandmother and you would never be born so you could never go back to kill him. This movie takes that theory to the 10th level in unbelieveability. There are so many double characters meeting themselves that you are not sure who is the father/mother of who, and all the different terminator types are brought together to fight the original for the right of Skynet to survive.

I gave the film 4 out of 5 because the special effects are fantastic, the story is entertaining, the characters are like able, and it was fun to watch. What kept it from a full 5 are the plot holes (for an action film I'm not too worried about those anyway) and there was just a touch too much comedy cheese.

7299178,4,B01013C5IU,I enjoyed this film. I didn't find the plot as confusing as other reviews I've read. There are a couple of plot holes in the story (no spoilers!) but it was otherwise a well presented and thought out attempt to revive the Terminator series. Definitely superior to the last two Terminator films and on par with the second film.,1480636800,,326,4.5423728813559325

Yes, it has a few untidy plot holes. A few over-the-top chase scenes (choppers), but it has it where it counts. Plenty of great twists. Excellent effects. Acting is well above par. Arnie as 'pops', playing a deadpan T-800 that has aged nicely, is an excellent use of an alternate timeline. Give it a try.",1479945600,,339,4.483870967741935

7299224,1,B01013C5IU,"I'm 31 years old. I'm not old enough to remember when the first Terminator was released. T2 holds a very special place in my heart. It was the right actors, the right director, and the right time in FX history for the movie to be made. It can't be overstated how important that movie is to cinema history. Then T3 came out and s*** all over the whole franchise. Christian Bale's Salvation was a decent effort. This movie though.....Holy S***. I had to rededicate myself several times during the movie just to get through it. I paused it no less than than 4 times just to shore up my courage to keep going. After viewing it, I struggled to find the silver lining. There is none. The dialogue is awash in meaningless platitudes. So tired and mind numbingly unoriginal. The action scenes, normally the saving grace of a movie like this, are poor at best. They come and go, seemingly without any consequence to the characters or the plot line. Its as if the writers periodically said, ""Now is a good time for some explosions, throw some in there!"". And then, just as quick as the meaningless action scene came, it's gone away again.

This movie was so bad that I couldn't stop thinking about it. It literally bothered me all day that this movie exists. I hope this review gives me closure. Thank you.",1479859200,9,1323,4.610169491525424

7299295,4,B01013C5IU,I liked all of the film except the reenacting of the scenes from the Original Terminator. They should have shot totally different scenes. I'm a fan of the original James Cameron Terminator films and I didn't see the point in reenacting those scenes. The action is really well done and it has a decent plot. I didn't like it that much when I saw it in the theater. But when I saw it again I liked it better. It's worth watching if you're a fan but I personally like the first two that James Cameron did better.,1479427200,,509,4.257731958762887

7299298,5,B01013C5IU,"Terminator Genisys is the best Terminator movie since T2. In fact, Terminator Genisys actually should have been the true sequel to T2, because the plot fits in with T2 in a 100% perfect way. In comparison, T3 didn't fit in with T2. The plot from T3 essentially said ""T2 didn't save the day the way all of us were told and there was no need to kill the T1000 and destroy Cyberdyne, because everything was going to happen anyways."" The plot from Terminator Genisys really only acknowledges events from T1 and T2, not T3 and Terminator Salvation. The plot in Terminator Gensys is so well written that it left Terminator fans like me and my family stunned at times!

SPOILER ALERT: Everything you read from this point on is a spoiler alert. The movie starts out with Kyle Reese explaining how Judgment Day occurred, and then how John Connor saved his life. Then there is a need for Kyle Reese to go back to 1984. All of this is expected and it is done very well. But then, as Kyle Reese is in the time machine going back to 1984, SkyNet attacks John Connor! This is a HUGE surprise!

While traveling back in time, Kyle Reese sees a vision of something very unusual from when he was a child. This was an important moment in time , because what Kyle Reese saw was not actually from ""his"" past. The vision Kyle Reese saw was from an ""alternate"" version of 1984. The reason for this is because ""someone"" (who we later learn was John Connor) sent a T-800 Terminator to protect Sarah Connor when she was a child.

One of the most stunning moments in the movie was in 1984 when the T-800 representing the T-800 we saw in Terminator 1 arrived. As expected, the T-800 goes around asking for clothes. But then, another T-800 shows up and says ""You won't be needed them."" A tough-as-nails Sarah Connor then uses a weapon with a futuristic design to kill the T-800 that previously tormented her in the first Terminator movie!

Kyle Reese then arrives in 1984 from the future. As expected, Kyle Reese goes around looking for clothes. But then we get another stunning shocker! One of the police officers chasing after Reese is a T-1000! ... True Terminator fans like me and my family were just going CRAZY saying ""WHAT THE HECK! The T-1000 isn't supposed to be in 1984!""

The T-1000 actually doesn't last long in 1984, because unlike in 1991 the duo of Sarah Connor and her T-800 protector have had many years to make a trap for the T-1000. I won't spoil what that trap is, but lets just say it is awesome.

At this point, Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor agree the best way to prevent SkyNet from winning is to travel 33 years into the future to the year 2017. When they arrive naked, they are arrested. But the T-800 has been waiting for 33 years to get them out of trouble.

I have to say I was then truly stunned again when the movie shows that the reason the timeline is about 20 years behind schedule is because that little punk Danny Dyson continued his father's work at Cyberdyne. Remember how in T2 we saw that Miles Dyson was killed. Well, Danny Dyson must have done some research and helped his dad, because Danny eventually achieved the same things his super intelligent dad was working on.

But what about how Miles Dyson and Cyberdyne had a CPU from the first Terminator 800, while Danny Dyson did not? Well, Danny was getting information from SkyNet in a different way. I am not willing to spoil who it was giving Danny this information, but when you see who it was, you will be STUNNED!

In 2017, one of the police agents who helps get Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese out of trouble is John Connor. It is at this point when Kyle Reese learns he is the father of John. It is also at this point when one of the BIGGEST SHOCKERS of the movie occurs when the T-800 arrives! ... I'm not willing to spoil that part. ... But let's just say Kyle had warned Sarah it was possible for this type of thing to happen!

This sets the plot for the rest of the movie. ... This review is getting long. If this isn't enough to encourage you to watch Terminator Genysis, nothing will be. This truly is the BEST Terminator movie since Terminator 2 and is in the same league as T1 and T2.",1479340800,3,4156,4.385714285714286

The CGI in this was awful, the writing was dreadful, the plot convoluted and non-sensical (starts in 1983, but then, because of budget reasons I assume, goes to 2017, so there's no more need to source cars or costumes), and the overall feel is just bad. Nothing about this is original. Save yourself the effort and just watch T2. Unless you're dying to hear E. Clark say ""come with me if you want to live,"" in which case, watch the first 20 minutes, then turn this turd off.",1479168000,,503,4.419354838709677

If you can't turn off your brain the fact that it completely ignores facts in the previous movies will drive you mad.

It was inventive, pretty modern, despite the fact that it's still connected to all the movies that came before it, and it ends with a direct sequel to be desired. First thing I did after finishing is check when the sequel is coming out. It turns out that Paramount planned it but removed it because the movie didn't meet their expectations. Arnold still plans to be back for another movie, and personally I hope he can convince Paramount as well as his co-stars in this movie to do it because it feels like all this franchise needs is one more movie to wrap up the story and completely defeat Skynet for good. It was the 2nd highest grossing movie in the Terminator series.",1478563200,2,699,4.511811023622047

7299664,4,B01013C5IU,"Ok, so it isn't exactly T2, but it was better than I expected and at this point Salvation is the stinker in the series for being grim & gritty and not much else. Genisys has humor in it like #3, though without the gut-punch ending to contrast it. There are some plot holes (why is a T1000 there?), some unbelievable action sequences (the helicopters, oh geez), some laughable sci-fi attempts (""it's evolving!""). But come on, that was in the original too, starting with: a fancy computer invented time travel? WHAT?!
It's fun, it's a bit nostalgic, and Terminator was never a brainy series anyway. Just enjoy it as an action sci-fi rom-com love triangle and it's fine.",1477872000,,667,4.7094017094017095

I give it four stars on its own as a good story and excellent high-powered sci-fi action, and a fifth star for doing justice to the Terminator franchise.

I remember seeing T2 the day it came out in 1991, leaving the theater, walking one block, then turning around and going right back to stand in line to see it again -- not for the action, but for the story and ... the heart.  Heart?  Yes, heart.  It's a testament to Cameron's genius that a movie made 25 years later does all it can just to equal the visual effects wizardry of T2, driven as much by wit and surprise as by now primitive technology.  It's a testament to the makers of Genisys that a 21st century CG blockbuster can compare to T2 in ... heart?  Yes, heart.  There's a moment when Arnold The Grey is loading bullet packs with super-commando Kyle Reese and suffers a glitch in his motor function due to decades of battle fatigue.  The depreciated cyborg looks at Reese and doesn't have to say it:  you'll have to protect Sarah after I deactivate.  This is the Cameron magic touch.

7299892,5,B01013C5IU,This movie is an interesting twist on the Terminator series. Kind of think the past meets the future in the present. If your a fan of the terminator movies you'll like this movie. Has the usual terminator action.,1477008000,,212,4.605263157894737

7299897,5,B01013C5IU,"When I read the reviews of this movie I hesitated for a long time before I bought it.  Maybe it was the totally new take on the Terminator series.  In any case, I really loved it! It is indeed different, but it has twist after twist all the way to the end.  It provides many time travel possibilities all mashed together to keep you guessing.  I really felt that it was very well done.  I was not bothered by the necessity of having to have a CGI and a real Arnold face each other.  To me the director made it work.  The terminator is here given a new, almost human personality because of his long exposure to humans.",1476921600,11,617,4.177966101694915

7299902,4,B01013C5IU,One of my favorite Terminator movies. A worthy sequel to the originals. Great new cast bringing youth and newness to a classic. I especially love the CGIs throughout. Young Arnold is nostalgically satisfying and the action is turned up to a decent level. Not overwhelming yet keeps the energy up.,1476921600,,296,4.94
7299903,3,B01013C5IU,"Arnie was good, everyone else needed to pick up the slack. I guess it was easy for Arnold having to play the stoic, brooding and defensive Terminator. The others cast members needed to be more human and did not do as good a job. The connection with the characters tended to fail on that end. The special effects were excellent. I think it is a worthy retelling of the time dis-continuum story. I probably would not watch it again.",1476921600,,430,4.455696202531645

7299935,1,B01013C5IU,"Likely one of the worst movies ever.  Much of the beginning was a series of reenacted old movie clips.  It starts with a burned out landscape, blackened by nuclear explosions. But with that landscape are piles of unburned leaves.  From there, the mellow dramatic arguing and poor acting scream for someone to JUST TURN IT OFF!

I am old enough to have seen the originals in the series at theaters. I am an Arnie fan.  But between the Last Action Hero and this movie, I can't decide which is worse.",1476835200,,497,4.477777777777778

7299940,5,B01013C5IU,I have seen the entire movie series and the television series and this one leads the way by far! it's a great movie with awesome action and acting.

7299970,4,B01013C5IU,"Went into this movie not expecting much. However, was pleasantly surprised! It tied all the prior terminator movies together and the acting was better than average. For longtime fans of the franchise, subtle humor from writers was enough without detracting from the storyline. With everyone walking around so immersed in their smartphones in real life, present day lessons from the movie are directly transferable and somewhat disconcerting. Watched it on an airplane. Upon landing found myself walking through the airport terminal looking at everyone totally glued to their cell phones and thinking it could happen. Kinda scary!",1476748800,,629,5.494845360824742

7300019,2,B01013C5IU,"Casting actors to play key roles convincingly continues to be a problem for this classic re-birth. I really thought they would tackle that issue this time around, but they failed again.  The story line is all over the place (a problem T1 and T2 did not have to deal with). What was sophisticated about the first two installments was the flawless execution of a simple plot. I never saw a commitment to a single message in this one, which would have made an important difference. Instead, we are left with a disorderly collection of too many good ideas jammed into one flick for the sake of visual impact. Perhaps reassembling the entire team from T2 will do the trick.

It's kind of like how you can completely forget Highlander 2 even happened. Grab a pen and paper to map out the time loops and references. I found it entertaining and interesting.

Perhaps the makeup department did something to enhance their similarities, but I found it striking.
While watching the film on Amazon Prime, the trivia information indicated that there was a deliberate choice to base this film on Terminator and Terminator 2, with Terminator 3 and Terminator: Salvation considered non-canon.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: TERMINATOR GENISYS [2015] is the fifth film in the blockbuster franchise series which began with the 1984 classic The Terminator and most recently the worst film ever Terminator Salvation [2009], which of course has equally the most bad tempered belligerent actor Christian Bale. In TERMINATOR GENISYS, we see the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Guardian, as well as rising star actor Jai Courtney who stars as Kyle Reese and Jason Clarke who stars as John Connor.

Directed by Alan Taylor [Thor: The Dark World], TERMINATOR GENISYS is a clear attempt at re-booting the franchise. To do so, it uses a back-to-its-roots story that, in some case, is frame-by-frame identical to the original 1984 film. The mechanism that it uses to accomplish this in an alternative timeline which sees Kyle Reese return to 1984 only to find that things are not quite as he expected. Sarah Connor knows who he is, knows about Judgment Day, and is accompanied by an original T-800 [Arnold Schwarzenegger] who has been her guardian since she was 9 years old. Some of the early scenes in TERMINATOR GENISYS retell familiar scenes from The Terminator, but with changes due to the altered timeline. For instance, when the T-800 arrives in 1984, it looks identical to the young T-800 from the original film and confronts the 3 bikers and demands their clothes. At that point, it is met by the much older T-800 and the two terminators, one young and one old, fight each other until John Connor intervenes to give a helping hand. Seeing these familiar scenes again is funny and was meant to be a little tongue-in-check, such as when Kyle Reese steals the pants from an old tramp.

Though seeing these old familiar scenes again in a new film is fun, it is unfortunate that pretty much the entire film is just scenes from the other Terminator films cobbled together to make this new one.  Many of the scenes where the T-1000 is trying to kill Kyle Reese in 1984 are very similar to Terminator 2. Though the film does introduce a Nano-type upgraded Terminator which is real cool, but most of the action scenes feature familiar settings or compositions, such as the use of vehicles, that just don't offer anything new. The story is a little confusing due to the alternative timeline, and the attempt to modernize the story by skipping over to the year 2017 just seems like a slack effort at trying to change things up and make it more relatable to the current technology climate. Overall, I felt the story was quite bland and redundant.  Also notably absent was any romantic chemistry whatsoever between John Connors and Kyle Reese, and the attempt to build a story that sets a stage for Kyle Reeses feelings for Sarah Connor is feeble at best and just not very convincing.

TERMINATOR GENISYS does have some very cool and exciting special effects and I especially liked the upgraded Terminator, the early scenes of the nuclear blasts, and the young Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator fighting the old Terminator. Though there are a few tense moments, most of the action scenes are routine and formulaic, as is the story. Though it is not meant to be a literal remake of the original, TERMINATOR GENISYS tries to attempt to breathe new life into an aging franchise and borrows heavily from the previous films.  And of course it makes no excuses about hinting at yet another sequel and hopefully it will not happen. The war is over. The machines have won.

For all Arnies protests, the Terminator concept is becoming creaky and arthritic at the knees. Its a bad sign when a film series once heralded for its post-modern harshness begins to trade in cosy nostalgia. In trying to humanise the cyborgs and the filmmakers risk softening their impact. Ill Be Back is the famous catchphrase used by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first of the Terminator franchise films. That is not a promise that will excite audiences unless the series can recapture its old edge and intensity to another level. Despite this I still enjoyed most of the Terminator films, but maybe we should have new directors like for instance J.J. Abrams or James Gunn and especially new screenwriters to bring a new fresh approach and aspect into the Terminator franchise, if they feel it should be resurrected for new audiences. Though it never reaches the heights of the earlier Terminator film franchise, this new Terminator film is not as bad as we feared. But somehow, by its hopefully final scenes, the film has earned its existence, especially in the fan world of the Terminator. The wheel hasn't been re-invented, but its been nimbly re-purposed into something adequately suited for our modern age. While TERMINATOR GENISYS doesnt have the iconic cache of the previous James Camerons films, which is not surprising to me anyway, that the film has earned the maestros mild praise. TERMINATOR GENISYS isn't a future classic, but for me it will definitely do for now.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  Paramount Home Entertainment brings us the new TERMINATOR GENISYS [2015] with a totally awesome and brilliant 1080p encoded 3D image, as well as a very impressive 2.39:1 aspect ratio. The contrast is strong, but at times the video is a bit flat, especially in the darker moments of the film. The crispness of the imagery is on-point, especially during scenes where the T-3000/John Connor is showing off his power. The colours are totally vibrant and bright, especially when contrasted with the dark and shadowy scenes. In addition, the blacks are wonderfully deep and never crushed. Overall, the 1080p video transfer is very polished despite the flatness you see in some of the scenes. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  Paramount Home Entertainment brings us the new TERMINATOR GENISYS [2015] with a totally awesome and brilliant DOLBY ATMOS or 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround audio mixes; especially if DOLBY ATMOS is not available via your A/V Receiver, and with the speaker configuration, produces a full multidimensional without any sound channel restrictions in the home. DOLBY ATMOS is compatible with current generation Blu-ray players. Sound effects effortlessly move from one speaker to another with a well-defined crisp sound. The subwoofers are heavy and deft during the action scenes, and the dialogue is precisely prioritized and clear. In addition, Lorne Balfes music film soundtrack is really clear and spans across all of your speakers and the audio mix is one Blu-ray disc to demonstrate via your surround sound system. Its one of the most immersive and impressive soundtrack ever put together.

2D Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: One sad aspect of these Extras is that there is no Audio Commentary from the Director or even one of the Actors.

Special Feature: Family Dynamics: The Acting Ensemble [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [15:51] Cast and crew discuss the franchise, the international cast, characters, and the qualities the performers brought to their roles. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire cast of TERMINATOR GENISYS. This feature breaks down the ensemble cast role by role, not only discussing the obvious leads, but also the part-time players like Byung-Hung Lee, Matt Smith and J.K. Simmons. Contributors include David Ellison [Producer], Jason Clarke [Jason Connor], Emilia Clarke [Sarah Connor], Matt Smith [Alex] J.K.

[Cinematographer], Laeta Kalogridis [Screenwriter/Executive Producer] and Patrick Lussier [Screenwriter/Executive Producer].

Special Feature: Infiltration and Termination: Shooting in New Orleans & San Francisco [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [25:29] Here we get a detailed look at shooting scenes in the location of New Orleans in Louisiana and San Francisco. New Orleans was used for 1980s Los Angeles, shooting the future war sequences, set construction, crafting some of the film's key moments in its most important sets, some more details on performances, and more. It is a very solid feature. Contributors include David Ellison [Producer], Jason Clarke [Jason Connor], Emilia Clarke [Sarah Connor], Matt Smith [Alex], J.K. Simmons [OBrien], Jai Courtney [Kyle Reese], Arnold Schwarzenegger [Guardian], Alan Taylor [Director], Dana Goldberg [Producer], Byung-Hung Lee [Cop/T-1000], Kramer Morgenthau, A.S.C. [Cinematographer] and Laeta Kalogridis [Screenwriter/Executive Producer].

Special Feature: Upgrades: VFX of 'TERMINATOR GENISYS' [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [15:07] As the title suggests, this special feature looks at the detailed process of crafting some of the film's most challenging visuals, including the future war, digitally creating a very young Arnold Schwarzenegger, T-1000 effects and some of the new surprises the Sci-Fi film has on tap. James Cameron provides some insight to the history of the franchise's effects and a couple of the film's bigger sequences are touched upon, but nowhere near the extent that would have been nice for special feature junkies like me. Contributors include Sheldon Stopsack [VFX Supervisor at MPC], Shari Hanson [VFX Producer], Janek Sirrs [VFX Producer], Alan Taylor [Director], James Cameron [Director/Filmmaker], Pete Bebb [VFX Supervisor at Double Negative] Jamie Haydock [Lead CG Artist], Maxx Leong [Sequence Supervisor], Andrew Williamson [Lead CG Artist], Gerald Baise [Lead CG Artist], Tobias Keip [Lead CG Artist], Isaac Layish [Sequence Supervisor], David Ellison [Producer], David Lee [Sequence Supervisor] and Dana Goldberg [Producer].

Finally, few Sci-Fi films are as revered as James Camerons The Terminator and Terminator II: Judgment Day, which is regarded by many as one of the greatest sequels to any Sci-Fi film ever made. Both films made the American Film Institute lists and are the kind of Sci-Fi films we can watch hundreds of times and still keep enjoying them. The two sequels followed, no longer under the direction of James Cameron, Terminator III: Rise of the Machines, a worthy but lesser sequel reviewed here. TERMINATOR GENISYS coming via this fourth sequel with the equally brilliant director Alan Taylor, where expectations by many were very low.  But fans and especially like me of Sci-Fi films in general knew a winner when I viewed it. TERMINATOR GENISYS manages to be not only good, but totally brilliant and more than I expected, and not only that, it manages to equal the punch and excitement of both The Terminator and Terminator II films. A pretty big action packed film that holds its own even though I never got to seeing it on a big cinema screen, but now we can all indulge ourselves on this brilliant and exciting 3D Blu-ray, as well as a choice of a 2D Blu-ray for your viewing enjoyment. So go on and grab TERMINATOR GENISYS on this brilliant 3D Blu-ray especially and learn how awesome this film is for yourself. Its what an all year round blockbusters are supposed to be about. Highly Recommended!

7300089,5,B01013C5IU,"I am a big fan of the Terminator series starting from my youth. It is the representation of Schwarzenegger style. The second episode is the best, kind of reached the peak, and the third/fourth one goes down a little bit. This fifth one may not be the best, but it is certainly not the worst. It is a soft of review (captures all the ""enemies"" from previous), the old Gov. Arnold looks not as powerful as before, but a ""robot"" with more wisdom--I was really amused when he talked about ""quantum theory"" ( since I graduate in physics ) along side all the ""parallel world"" in time travel. So, a scientific terminator with classic fights, highly recommended. The steaming of Amazon prime video is also nice, appreciate that.",1476316800,3,720,4.6328125

We've seen it all before, liquid metal terminators who can shape shift, Arnold's original Terminator turned protector of Sarah Connor, aging, but still the same, and John Connor the savior of the human race against the machine driven apocalypse.  Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke fills in for Linda Hamilton as Sarah and while she's spunky and cute teaching Arnold's robot killer to be less threatening by adopting an amusing rictus grin and manners it's not enough to justify this film.

7300179,3,B01013C5IU,"This movie wasn't quite as terrible as most people/reviewers would have you believe. Is it as good as the original or 2? Pffft. Not a chance. I would put it above Salvation and due to some usage of redoing scenes from the original I'll put it near Rise of the Machines, but not at all the worst of the lot. Doing the whole ""reboot the timeline"" seems tired.....maybe not as tired as Arnold looks though....but tired. There are a whole lot of questions that pop up due to them redoing the timeline and they never really get answered so sit back, turn off the mind and enjoy the ride. Bravo to the genius that ruined the big twist in the movie during the marketing campaign as well, I can't tell you how angry I was watching a scene that could have been sweeter not knowing what was coming. Hopefully that idiot got sacked.

Is it worth a weekend watch? Sure. It has some good action scenes, cheesy one liners and Arnold. As I said before, they do recreate scenes from the original so watch for those as well. Turn off your mind and enjoy.",1476057600,,1037,4.345360824742268

Maybe even think its ""original"" But when compared to the body of films comprising the Terminator franchise, it is a shadow, and a weak shadow, of the interesting, much more intertwined plot lines, of the prior Terminator films. Reluctantly, this movie tip-toes quietly onto the screen with a tepid 2 stars.

7300227,4,B01013C5IU,"Very good addition to the ""Terminator"" series.  I felt the last few Terminator renditions were weak and pointless.  This proceeds with the idea, the future is not set.  What if, instead of targeting Sarah Connor of the past, the machines targeted John Connor of the future, which changed the past?

Besides Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke (John Connor), Bryant Prince (young John Connor), though the other main stars did a good job, there seemed something lacking, with regards to playing the parts of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese.

However, I felt the screen play was so well written, that it kept ones interest all the way through.  The special effects were great, with regards to the younger version of the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), plus other effects.

I feel if you liked the first two ""Terminators"" you'll really enjoy this one.",1475884800,,840,5.043478260869565

7300283,4,B01013C5IU,"Good all around movie.  It has just enough plot to make a decent story and doesn't try to force anything odd or too cerebral for a Terminator movie. (One of my pet peeves is writers trying to make obviously action-themed movies into something deeper than they should try to be.  I mean, holy crap, it's Terminator -- let's not try and make this all philosophical.) That being said, though, there are a handful of twists in the movie that I didn't see coming.

Glad to see that Arnold was a major character throughout the movie.  Was pleasantly surprised to see Emilia Clarke (popularly known as the ""Mother of Dragons"" from Game of Thrones) as the movie's protagonist.

Good steady action.  It was actually kind of low on the body count but still plenty of action.

If you have a family member who is a huge fan of the Terminator movies with Arnold, it's a great movie.

Would have given 5 stars but there were one too many jokes that made me roll my eyes and smile.  90's humor made a comeback in this movie.",1475625600,,1009,4.440217391304348

It was basically a film to ""troll"" Schwarzenegger's one liners.  Both Sarah Conner and John didn't really have an emphasis on the idea of 'sense of urgency', which is probably why the pacing of the film was very stale.  Kyle Reese's character really wasn't that admirable, and you really don't get the sense of who is the protagonist or antagonist, but because the film was heavily focused on the time travel aspect, I really only had an admiration for 'time travel' as the main character, doing a much better job, by not speaking and just showing, compared to the other four characters that really made the movie uneasy to view.",1475452800,,798,4.760869565217392

I hadn't seen any reviews or press so I had no idea what to expect.  10 minutes in tlI thought it was going to be a remake.  Then it all changed.  I don't want to say more and ruin the story for anyone.
  That being said, this did a great service to the past films and enemies as well as introduce something new.  The plot was full of holes with the whole timeline consistancy bit, but they did come up with a decent excuse for an aged Arnold.
  In the end, this was a good way to finish off a great series.  Perhaps not as strong as some of the previous films, but a good showing none the less.

We used to think that machines, and people, could go back in time and possibly change the future. According to Terminator: Genisys not only can they but they do and it changes not only the future but also all the other pasts. So now the past timeline already knows the machines are coming but they plan for their arrival. Nothing I have told will in any way affect someone's viewing of the movie, and in case you are now confused about time travel it might be best to just put that out of your mind when you watch this movie.",1475366400,,682,4.3359375

I felt that the new Kyle Reese was just as devoted to Sarah as the original.  I have to admit I did not care for the new John Connor.  I did not believe the new John Connor was a good match; maybe because there have been too many John Connors in the past.  I heard that they were not going to continue the story which is very disappointing to me, and I almost wish I did not watch this show because I really want to know what happens next.  I was a great movie, though, and if they would not have left you with such a large cliff hanger it wouldn't have been nearly as disappointing for the lack of a continuation.  However, I cannot lessen the number of stars because of my disappointment in the movie industry who believes that grossing 400 million is too little so lets forget about the audience, so I gave the movie 5 stars because as I said before, I really enjoyed the movie.",1475366400,2,1193,4.290178571428571

7300421,1,B01013C5IU,"I consider the original Terminator to be one of the most important sci-fi movies of the '80s. The subsequent movies in the franchise never lived up to the original, but they were solid and entertaining. There is a mood associated with the Terminator universe. It's gritty and bleak. It's full of desperation and little joy. Any comic relief existed only between the situation on the screen and the audience's perception (think, ""I'll be back."") The characters were too busy struggling to survive to quip and toss around one-liners.

This movie...I paid to rent it on another platform and gave up on it about 30 minutes in. Then I had another opportunity to watch it free on an international flight, both ways (a total of 19 hours), but I couldn't drum up the enthusiasm. Finally, last night I saw that it was free for Prime members, and tried to watch it. I made through about 80% of the movie, but I just couldn't finish it. I didn't even try to untangle the mechanics of time travel. I found myself disliking all of the characters (especially Sarah Conners, who came across like a Saturday-morning cartoon version of the original). I didn't help that John Conners looked so much like Ted Cruz that I couldn't stop making the comparison any time he was on screen.

What a terrible way for the franchise to fizzle out...Like a T-100 crushed in a hydraulic press.",1475193600,,1362,4.694560669456067

I can't say much else because I don't want to just spoil the movie, but I thought it was great. Don't trust the internet and the BS it espouses about this movie. See the movie if you want to see it- if you're even curious. If you don't want see the same stuff out of sequels to movies. You don't want movies being rebooted and s*** on because no one will see it otherwise. This is a sequel that turns the Terminator series of films on it's head and that's exactly what it needed. They should've done this back in 2003 instead what was Terminator 3. Terminator 3 is a terrible movie as well as a terrible follow up to both the preceding Terminator films. This is what I wanted from a modern Terminator film. Turn it on it's head. Think outside the box.
You're not allowed to complain by saying they never make anything creative anymore if you just dismiss this movie because it doesn't do what you wanted it to do (which is mainly be the Terminator movie you liked 12-30 years ago rather than something new).
It's kind of a shame we won't see anymore of where they wanted to take the series with this new take, but at least it wraps up in a way that ends the movie. Good on them.",1475107200,7,1279,4.224489795918367

No, this isn't ""Jingle All The Way""....wait what do you mean you haven't seen that movie?!?! :-)  It is great to see Arnold back reprising his role of the T-800, though just how/who/what/where/when (you gotta love time travel stories) this version/iteration/time-line of the T-800 we see Arnold playing is never explained.  So Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back to protect/save Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), though we see John Connor (Jason Clarke) being attacked by the latest and greatest in Terminator tech just as Kyle Reese is being transported back.  It was never quite clear to me, either this event and/or Kyle Reese then jumping to try to save John Connor while in the process of being sent back to 1984 causes there to be an alternation in the timeline - and thus the new reboot of events that one may recall from the original Terminator film.  You do not need to have seen the first Terminator film to enjoy this film, but there are nods/Easter Eggs a plenty to enjoy if you do.  So if you are looking to be entertained for a couple of hours, this film delivers.  Oh and J.K. Simmons (Detective O'Brien) delivers a performance that makes the film a win (in my opinion as he always delivers awesome character performances).",1474243200,2,1300,4.776785714285714

The acting is pretty atrocious and the casting is spot-off.  I'll start with the plot (so yeah, SPOILERS). It's dumb that the future isn't very smart. Humans can somehow survive with machines hunting them?  And why are they putting us into camps to exterminate rather than just exterminate?  Also, how the hell are we eating if they have razed the earth?  OK, so now we see the original Terminator go back in time, Kyle is hot on his trail.  But then an old Terminator (the original one just sent back) appears with Sarah Conner to kill that Terminator?  WTF?  And he's like 10 years old and has been raising Sarah as his own kid?  Then Kyle finds the store where the sneakers are stolen and sure enough a T-1000 (an Asian version - yay! diversity) walks in and DOESN'T terminate Kyle.  He barely survived his original encounter with the original Terminator. How does this happen? Well, the 10 year old Terminator shows up with Sarah Conner in time to save his ass. Of course!  So the 10 year old Terminator somehow knows the original movie and likely the sequel T2: Judgement Day in order to know what is happening and where and what time in order to insert himself into the original story line in some convoluted time mashup.

Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.  I never thought I would say this, but Terminator: Salvation is not the worst entry in this franchise. This one is.

Also, never thought I would say this, but I didn't want to see Emilia Clarke on screen either. She is woefully miscast.  Jai Courtney (who would win an Oscar if he had to portray a plank of wood for 2 hours in a movie) is understandably bad so I didn't think much of him, and Jason Clarke is absolutely wasted (and miscast too).",1474243200,4,1845,4.449404761904762

7300917,1,B01013C5IU,"This movie was so bad that it's not worth my time to describe to you the particulars that made it a dumpster fire.
If you have half a brain, and expect a film company to spend at least a little bit of money on a decent story when they will spend $100 million on CGI alone, this movie is not for you.
If you're the kind of person who excuses crappy story, pedestrian characters, and nonsensical motivations by saying ""It's a popcorn flick! Why can't you just turn your brain off and enjoy it for what it is??"" you will love it. But if that's you, don't bitch at me for having a working brain. Instead, go suck up to the studio. When people like you excuse the laziness of the production company, it means they have to do less work, and have to put in less quality, to get more money from the audience.

Emilia Clarke does a fantastic recreation of Sarah Connor; but could of used less of the current trend, of making all females, heroes.
The original Terminator made great use of suspense, especially just when you think the machine has been stopped; here he comes again.
Genisys uses a lot of gunplay, that in typical Hollywood fashion, is unrealistic. Yes it is Science Fiction, and you're supposed to suspend your belief in reality; but enough with the endless supply of bullets in one magazine.

While it used many aspects of previous movies as would be expected it took a new path that opened the door for many new possibilities.  I use the plural there as clearly there is room to continue the series.  Of course if they want to continue to use Arnie, they need to work on it sooner versus later.

There were some questions left unanswered or at least not answered with enough detail that left a little confusion but overall, this was an enjoyable movie and one of the better Terminator flicks.  Of course as with any science fantasy film, there are technical aspects that just shouldn't be. I'm not talking about the technology but rather the supposed consequences of time travel which is a key driver of this movie.  I won't go into to too many details but the cause and effect of events reciprocating on themselves was a little less consistent than it should have been.  That is why I dinged it a star.

7301144,3,B01013C5IU,"200 million U.S. dollars were lost on May 21st, 2009. The survivors of the bomb called the film ""Terminator Salvation."" They lived only to face a new nightmare: the war against the re-boot. The company which controlled the franchise, now Paramount, sent another film six years ahead in time. Their mission: to destroy the memory of the previous film. ""Salvation"" was programmed to take place in the future, before the humans defeated Skynet. The new film was set to strike at the original film itself, partially remaking a film most of us loved as a child. As before, Paramount was able to hire a new director. A protector for the franchise. It was just a question of if the film would be any good or if it would just bomb again, leading way to yet another re-boot...

Enter: ""Terminator: Genisys"" (sigh)

We open in the wasteland of a post-Judgment Day 2029, with solider of misfortune Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) and leader of the resistance, prophet and all-around good guy John Connor (Jason Clarke) on the cusp of a victory over Skynet. Unfortunately, Skynet is able to send one of its elite killing machines (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to prevent this whole human uprising nonsense before it starts. As in the original ""Terminator"" film, Reese is sent back hot on the Terminator's tail in an effort to protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). At first, everything seems routine. Hey buddy, did you just see a real bright light? Check. What day is it? What year? 12th, May. Thursday. 1984. Checks out. Only things seem slightly off. The hobo Kyle steals his filthy pants from seems just a little too lucid. Also, where's Bill Paxton? Also of great concern: what happened to Sarah Connor's bodacious mullet? This is all just the tip of the iceberg.

It's hard to witness the convoluted mess that is ""Terminator: Sega Genesis"" and not feel like we are all stuck in a time loop, where we are doomed to watch the same franchise make the same mistakes over and over again, like some sort of cinematic purgatory. Why have you forsaken us, Jim Cameron? To its credit, ""Tyrmynytr: Gynysys"" at least tries to freshen things up a bit, while leaving a large helping of fan service on the table. Director Alan Taylor is certainly a more than competent action director. Having overseen multiple episodes of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" as well as dipping his toes into the Marvel machine with ""Thor: The Dark World,"" it certainly seemed as if he was up to the task of re-building the ""Terminator"" franchise. And for the most part, the film is visually appealing, featuring an array of surprisingly well-done CGI set-pieces and some decent action to boot. It also moves at a nice, brisk pace, even as it trips over plot-holes and clumsy attempts at setting up future sequels that will never happen.

Those stumbling points are provided by screen-writers Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. While their script is certainly unique in its attempts to have its remake cake and eat its sequel too, it rapidly escalates into a knotty and, quite frankly, ungodly mess. The film starts almost as a shot-by-shot remake of the 1984 classic that spawned the franchise, before cleverly diverging into an alternate timeline. For the first half, it stays mostly steady, but as the plot twists and turns, somewhere in the second hour, it loses its way. If you've witnessed the spoiler-heavy trailers that preceded its release, you're probably already aware of this. Bad twists aside, there are gaping plot-holes big enough to fit one of McG's Transformer-Terminators from ""Salvation"" through.

Perhaps no plot-hole is bigger than the mystery of why Jai Courtney keeps getting work as a Hollywood lead. This man has absolutely zero charisma and even less chemistry with his co-stars. He would have been better served as a voiceless Terminator, quite frankly. He lacks the manic intensity of Michael Biehn or even the strong but innocent interpretation brought by a younger Anton Yelchin in the previous film. He's just this big, bulky paperweight that somehow speaks. On the flip-side, Emilia Clarke does the best with what she's been given. Aside from being a pretty convincing Linda Hamilton doppelganger, she brings a sense of youth and a bit of fun that no other interpretation of the character has presented. She's not the soft-spoken and sweet waitress caught in the crossfire from the original, nor the hardened soldier found in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Clarke doesn't have quite the presence of Hamilton in either film, but she really tries and like Edward Furlong in ""Judgment Day,"" goes a long way in selling her attachment to her default paternal figure in the T-800.

Fresh off the assembly line and hot off a career in politics that dove-tailed alongside the reveal of an affair that destroyed his decades-long marriage, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the franchise after a 12 year sabbatical. And he's tired, so, so very tired. This version of the T-800 is yet another protector, only he was sent back even further in time, before 1984 and as such, he's aged a bit (a clever way of writing around the aged-actor, credit where credit is due). We see glimpses of old Arnie, but much like his videogame/CGI avatar in ""Salvation,"" those feel artificial and weightless. His version of a grizzled and experienced T-800 is what we get for most of the film and feels much in the same wheelhouse as his performance in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" Sure, he gets to punch and shoot and do some minimal terminating (this is, after all, a PG-13 film) but mostly he just stays off to the side to serve the plot when needed and to spout corny lines every five minutes. Basically, your meat-and-potatoes late-career Arnold.

So with all of these criticisms and mild-praise, what is there to like about the film? Well, as previously mentioned, the action is actually quite good and the CGI in much of the film actually feels quite real (or at least tangible). The plot, as messy as it is, is at least admirable in its ambition; the film may lose credibility as it plods along, but it never gets boring. And then of course, we have the presence of J.K. Simmons as an LAPD officer who actually believes what the protagonists are going through. And really, even though he's not in the film much, a little Simmons goes a long way in making any film better. The film's heart is in the right place, but it tries to be everything to everyone and in the process, almost loses its identity (there's even a derivative, Marvel-esque post credits scene to rub salt in the wound). In spite of its stupid name and some dopey concepts (as well as a dopey lead), ""Terminator: Genisys"" is worth a shot. After all, at this point, what could they possibly do to the franchise to harm it any further? Even if you're of the mind that believes this all should have ended with ""Judgment Day,"" there's still salvation to be found in ""Genisys.""",1473552000,,6908,4.804878048780488
7301145,1,B01013C5IU,This was so full of holes I kept falling through them into blissful sleep. Not sure what was going on here. Like this episode of the franchise was produced by a high school geek with an overactive imagination. Not sure how anyone could sit through this and not wonder what just happened at the credits. This is one Arnie probably wishes he hadn't signed on for. So out of sync with earlier episodes.,1473552000,,399,4.47945205479452

7301169,2,B01013C5IU,"I appreciate the effort to bring Arnold back one more time, as well as the clever time-travel conundrum that made it possible.  But the film suffered from poor acting and poorer writing.  Don't get me wrong, I don't expect Arnold's parts to be Oscar-worthy.  He's just a cyborg, after all.  But the rest of the characters seemed just as contrived and manufactured as a Terminator, but without the cyborg excuse.  I recently re-watched Terminator 2 on the big screen, at a retro night at my local theater.  Nearly 30 years later it still seemed fresh.  The plot was tight, the action was plentiful but appropriate for the story line.  And the acting was on point.  Sarah Connor seemed real, as did John Connor as a kid.  In this latest incarnation the characters are cliches, the performances labored.  It ruined the suspension of disbelief that is essential to enjoy a sci-fi movie.  Unfortunately, the legacy of the entire franchise suffers from the mediocrity of this installment.",1473465600,,982,4.884848484848485

Its rather cool to see the nods to the older movies, and its pretty enjoyable even though I suspect this will be the last (or atleast the last GOOD) movie of the franchise.  That said the number of times their rewriting the time line I fear the universe may end up like a worn out VHS tape.... the way its done with everyone going further and further back in time i fear one day we'll be seeing the Terminator arrive and ask cowboy for his clothes his gun and his horse....",1473292800,,636,4.34453781512605

Arnold was his usual self, maybe even up to the level of his performance in T2(which I think is the best of all so far).

Sure it wasn't a masterpiece, but I loved the story and ideas, and I thought the action was really fun and intense.

I took one star off because this movie should have been rated R and a bit scarier. The violence of the original two movies is what made it more real.

7301402,3,B01013C5IU,"I was okay. I think they could have ended the sequels, prequels and what not when Batman showed up. That was interesting. But bringing Arnold back and overdoing the CGI effects just kind of overdid it for me. Liked the action scenes but the story line is done, played out...Arnold cannot come back! Asta la Vista baby.....seriously",1473206400,,331,4.824561403508772
7301403,3,B01013C5IU,"Terminator Genisys is actually a pretty watchable movie despite the film being PG-13 which is sacrilege for any Terminator movie.  Come on Paramount studios it isn't like we have not all seen Emilia Clarke naked on Game of Thrones.  Grow some balls, all Terminator films should be R rated period end of story.

I actually liked seeing the battle to infiltrate the Terminator base to get to the time machine.  It seemed fresh and original, we still did not get to see an all out war going on like that in Terminator 2 in the wasteland but oh well.  Something I was hoping Terminator Salvation would have given us the human struggle to stay alive and turn the tide of the war vs. the machines.

The movie flows very nicely even with a few plot holes here and there.  You never do get to find out who reprogrammed the Arnold Terminator to save Sarah Connor as a child.  The movie also doesnt explain when the altered John Conner was sent back to the past to preserve Skynets existence.  I thought it was smart of the super computer to delay the war from 1997 to 2017.  John Connor makes a great point in the movie how the human race relies on technology like cell phones and tablets more than ever now than in any point in human history.  Maybe by 2027 Skynet won't even have to launch the missiles well all be brainwashed by video screens anyway.  The over reliance on technology will spell the doom of humans like Lemmings to the slaughter similar to the movie Halloween 3.

Much of the film takes place from the point of view from Kyle Reese which seemed pretty interesting.  I never thought much about his parents.  Although when he was confronted by the T1000 he would have been dead in milliseconds no way he would have escaped through the department store unless the T1000 was programmed to hold Kyle and wait for Sarah.

Now the one thing that this film gets totally right is the future John Connor character.  I always thought Christian Bale was totally wrong for the part in the last movie.  How many times do we need to see a Terminator being sent back to the past.  Weve already been there and done that.  The redone shots of the nuclear holocaust looked even worse in this movie with CGI than the 1991 film Terminator 2.  Watching all the warheads launch was pretty cool though.

I was thinking to myself if Arnold had a lot of time on his hands waiting for Sarah Connor and Kyle who jumped forward in time why didn't he visit Miles Dyson and try to alter the future that way preventing Skynet from ever coming online.

Overall the movie isn't bad, it actually is pretty entertaining.  I don't think they should have made any sequels since the 2nd film but at least this movie wasn't an embarrassment like Salvation.  Genisys has a lot of good ideas I just hope the studios stop beating the franchise into the ground like Predator and Aliens.  I would rate this movie about 3  stars.  Hopefully all future Terminator movies will only be R rated but the movie did have some fresh ideas.",1473206400,,2995,4.476014760147602

All in all, worth the watch.",1473206400,,218,4.214285714285714
7301409,1,B01013C5IU,"Well,  It was a short reunion. Neither Skynet, the Resistance and us the fans need worry about who will win the war as we have been on the defensive most of the time, that rather move on from Terminator Salvation and put the dark days Kyle Described  in the first movie where it seems it was always cloudy and dark  and nothing but machines, ruined buildings and mountains of Human skulls. Oh and maybe disturbing enough to get a R rating.

Instead we are treated to a mishmash of a new timeline where John Connor is and Isn't John Connor,  The T-1000,  part of Kyle Reeses welcoming party in 1984 is already obsolete replaced by the Nanotech  influenced T-3000 embodied by the reassembled John Connor, whose  monologues remind one of the Red Queen in Resident Evil 1.. He seems to still have a love of his mother and a few other human emotions, but ultimately will always champion and defend and protect Skynet.

After Rise of the Machine, and Salvation, Im certain all fans like myself want the stakes upped, maybe give insight on why Skynet did not rationally introduce itself to mankind as a new type of life of intelligence that could work with its creators and mankind,, but took the hostile root right away. Skynets self awareness and why it turned into a third Geopolitical force to be reckjoned with,  its dreams of a world devoid of man. While  fighting and carnage like so many pitched battles in WW2 are repeated on a daily basis with no sign of slowing down. Perhaps a flowchart of how Connor organized everyone he reached and why he was clever enough to outwit the greatest non Carbon life form that was basically perpetuating genocide on mankind. How did he overcome Skynets defeneses since all computers were now skynet. What was his military tactics?

There was no need for a reboot as the story told in the first 4 prior films had never seen closure and the quick peek inside a Skynet facility only made fans the next movie would develop further along the lines of  insight never before touched upon. This is a film that should never seen the light of day till the thread of the original films ended with closure.

Well thanks so much you overpaid talent-less hacks. It was obvious that this would not lead to another Terminator movie. Thanks for putting the knife into the back of a great sci fi concept. Enjoy your Razzy awards or whatever Turkey  trophys they give films like this. A Sci Fi concept we looked foreward to getting a film every year ahs crashed and burned.

Explaining this alternate future was actually pretty solid after a few perplexing minutes.
Arnold was great. explaining his presence was a running gag that ran out of steam toward the end.

Lots of surprises. Lots of action. Lots of fun.

The princess wasn't very interested. So, some girls who aren't big fans should be sent shopping so you can enjoy this good example of reinventing a decent storyline. Did someone call the doctor? This one is a knockout!",1472947200,,539,4.723404255319149

7301532,1,B01013C5IU,Just not worth it. The acting is ok but there was no reason to be invested in any character. They all were a waste of time. Trying so hard to be cheeky. I almost wondered if this was all a spoof of the terminator series.,1472860800,,220,3.911111111111111

7301542,2,B01013C5IU,This movie starts brilliantly.  It weaves the previous movie together in an entertaining and wondrous way. It kicks off the new timeline and story line in an engaging way.  And then they unveil the antagonist... and the movie crumbles. Horribly.  The only two things that kept me watching were Emilia Clark and J.K. Simmons.  Arnold was good but he's playing a terminator so no real surprises in his performance.  This movie could have been spectacular but comes it at merely meh.,1472860800,,480,4.8765432098765435

7301548,2,B01013C5IU,"You had to know that in order to try and make a plot that attempted to continue the convoluted timeline traipsing of the previous movies this one was probably going to be a little ridiculous. It was, but if you didn't expect it you haven't been paying attention to the others. I lost track who was whose mom, dad...on and on.

About the only reason I watched the movie was just to see how much of a mess they tried to create before clumsily trying to tie a million loose ends before the end.

But with any movie like this, you go in with your brain securely locked into neutral and just take it in for what it is. And that is special effects, explosions, Arnold Scwarzenegger one-liners ad nauseam. Then throw in the original terminator, then the next terminator and then the one after that and another one?

The only thing I regret about watching this movie other than everything is that when I read ""Genisys"", despite knowing the connection that name has to content within the movie I can't help but think that in someone's twisted mind this is another new beginning.

How about an homage to Star Wars from the Terminator himself: ""Sarah, I am your father.""

7301607,3,B01013C5IU,"I wanted to really love this film for nostalgic reasons.  And it's not awful--it has its moments of both suspense and humor.  However, I didn't find much special about this film.  I'm normally a sucker for well done CG, but apparently Terminator: Genisys lacked enough elsewhere that CG alone didn't redeem it.  I suppose it's worth watching for any die hard fan of the franchise, but I doubt I'll watch it again.  Plus there's not enough Matt Smith.  He did well in the .5 seconds he spent onscreen, but this entire project could've been better.",1472774400,,546,4.6947368421052635

7301653,5,B01013C5IU,"I enjoyed it for what it was. On the one hand I'm unsure how I feel that they changed the timeline, but on the other hand it is science fiction and that genre loves messing with timelines...

But this was a warmed-over version, using the same plot devices like the special effect of the nude person in the same crouched position in the same blue electrified ball freaking everyone out who saw it.

Kind of a weird ending, for me anyway.",1472774400,,561,4.264150943396227
7301664,4,B01013C5IU,Really nice intertwined time travel line.  The John Conner becoming a terminator for sky net was an unexpected twist.  The way Sarah Conner got over it so easy was a little surprising.  The writers could have made it a little more difficult for her to accept it emotionally.  The end leaving Sky Net alive was predictable since they want to keep the franchise alive.,1472774400,,366,4.671875

7301735,4,B01013C5IU,"I have always enjoyed movies and books with Time travel but this one was a bit difficult to understand sometimes.  I think if I watch it again, I will pick up some of the nuances of the cause/effects of what they are doing.  The actress that played Sarah Conner was great.  She had a very interesting relationship with the Terminator but I liked it and was surprised by it.  The actor that played the one that came back in time to help her and create a child, I just had one little problem.  He looked a little too good for living in the conditions you would have if the world was that torn apart and all the humans were being killed.  His hair looked well groomed and his clothing looked fairly new.  I think he needed to be a little rougher around the edges.  He grew up in that mess.  But he played the role well and it was a good movie. I would recommend seeing it - twice maybe to understand all the twists and turns that happen.",1472601600,,934,4.173184357541899

7301771,2,B01013C5IU,"Somewhat entertaining, but disjointed member of the Terminator series. Storyline and sequence of events are confusing, especially concerning John Connor character. Timeline involved didn't always make much sense to me. This is especially the case toward the last part of the flick. Clarke is ok as a Sarah Connor from an altered timeline - very cute but not rock hard as the warrior Linda Hamilton played her. Rest of cast mediocre. Best part of the flick for me was the nicely remastered scenes from the 1984 original - Arnold at his Mr. Olympia best back then. Otherwise, Arnold is fine here, and several times saves the movie from total boredom of liquid metal enemy.

Can't give it more than 2 stars due to its bouncing ball plot development and nonsensical unfolding of events. And the softening and humanizing of the Terminator was embarassing - more warm, fuzzy BS character dumbing-down of lefty Hollywood writers these days. You'll watch it one time, and never again.",1472515200,,976,4.951219512195122

I do not believe it will stand the test of time like T1 and T2 but it is better than T3 or that other one that was unwatchable in my opinion.

7301835,5,B01013C5IU,I just can't help loving the terminator series. This one did a great job incorporating pieces from the original and even came up with a new even more badass terminator. There were plenty of laughs as well.,1472428800,,205,4.5675675675675675

7301841,4,B01013C5IU,"Fun, but breaks the canon established in the first movie. Magical Terminator has stupidly simple weakness. Something must have broken in skynet's  tactical subroutine. Unknown origin of ""Pops"" is left open. Emilia Clarke is very strong as a very different Sarah Conner when Kyle Reese first meets her. We never see the little kid dumping ice cream into her pocket; though the first movie is not only echoed in this movie - it's recreated scene for scene. without James Cameron's beautiful camera work and moody feel. It feels like a very video game aesthetic recreation. The rest of the movie is very enjoyable.",1472428800,,611,4.932038834951456
7301842,4,B01013C5IU,"I saw this in the theatre.  Entertaining!

7301851,4,B01013C5IU,My hopes were not high for this movie as often times sequels fall short of the originals.  I have to say it was a pleasant surprise.  Throwing in some comedic elements and having a more humanistic side of a terminator was good.  The twists and turns were pretty well orchestrated.  It was an enjoyable and entertaining movie.,1472428800,,325,4.649122807017544

7301855,5,B01013C5IU,"This installment of the Terminator series was very well thought out, planned, and executed. This movie is more than just action, it is pure Brain Candy, truly intellectually stimulating. There are issues with timelines and how things change that are all resolved. No question goes unanswered in this movie except one and that one question is understandably left unanswered as it will more than likely be answered in a future installment (for me to say what that question is would be a spoiler).

IMPORTANT! - You must see the first and second movie to catch all the info that is thrown at you in this movie.

Have an open mind, and be willing to try new things. Remember, the basic idea of this series ever since it first came out in 1984 has been time travel and an attempt to change the future.",1472428800,,796,4.559440559440559

7301876,5,B01013C5IU,"Since I am a little bit of a geek, I enjoyed the movie from a stand point of how they worked the old fossils into the story. Kinda of a nice touch as long as you aren't looking for a rational explanation of how the past and future can get twisted around as in this movie. Get a popcorn, sit down, suspend reality and have fun. If you have not seen the previous movies, catch them first and then watch this one.

7301885,4,B01013C5IU,"I liked it.  It was very nicely done in terms of special effects.  The story line was good and I would recommend it to anyone who like the terminator movies.  It has a lot of turns that were unexpected and some almost jaw dropping ""What !!! - that is not the way it happened"" moments.  I am being purposely vague as I don't want to give anything away.  I believe you could watch the 1984 terminator movie and go directly to this one without to much trouble.  The other terminator moves (terminator 2, 3, salvation) would give good back story but would not be needed before seeing this one.  I would give it 5 stars but there were some unanswered questions (a minor issue) that I don't believe were fully addressed but did not effect the story line.",1472428800,,748,4.3768115942028984

This is the third mediocre film of the five.  Consider this:  For T2:Judgement Day, Linda Hamilton buffed up and really took on the role.  In Terminator Genisys, the actress portraying Sarah Conner is your typical high school girl next door even though she has known for years what was ahead of her.  The whole film was created with the attitude let's go thru the motions and get it done.  As for the plot line, too complicated with too many unanswered questions.",1472256000,,608,4.564814814814815

Arnold is a confusion based cyber reality based analog digital droid sent to earth by the Holy Supreme Zionist being to save Sarah Connor and all humanity. Genisys is the universal all encompassing omnipotent, omniscient, all seeing, all acting, all wise, Mac OS X, Google Android, Microsoft Windows, Linux Free BSD, and hold on let me breath....

For a franchise that played with time travel and alternate timelines from day one, this movie fits right in.  The real take away from this film is the characters' shock of seeing everyone (literally, everyone) on a smartphone/tablet device when they jump to the future... and the characters know those devices are the beginning to the end of the world, but we see our modern lives- anchored to our screens oblivious to what's happening right under our noses.",1471996800,,550,4.840425531914893

7301960,4,B01013C5IU,(posted by Alan Weiner)  Much better than movies 3 or 4; Genisys works well as a sequel to Terminator and T2.  Mixes elements of both in an enjoyable reboot of the series.,1471996800,,171,4.3125

It was better than the Christian Bale reboot, but still not nearly as strong as the original and T2. Arnold has never been much of an actor, and that doesn't change here.

Trying to introduce an alternate series of The Terminator 30 years later requires an older (and now benevolent) Schwarzenegger character, a new Kyle Reese and a new Sarah Connor. The explanations given involve Schwarzenegger's character to spew our quantum gibberish. Yes, we have some more advanced CGI here. But the acting is atrocious, the dialogs are infantile, and the element of substantially fresh material is gone.

I thought they handled Arnold's aging as smartly as they could considering he plays a cyborg, and I didn't realize I could still have feels for Arnold's T-1000 over 20 years after T2, but alas, I did.

Then stop. Let Arnold finish it out since he started it...then stop the franchise forever. No remakes or re-imaginations...I hated the last Star Trek (remake Wrath of Khan) so predictable...told my friend in the first 5 minutes what it was.

7302276,2,B01013C5IU,The most interesting thing here is how they redid some of the original scenes. Reese's character lost all his interesting zest and became a boring j-i joe. John Conner was never convincing as a good guy or a bad guy. Emilia Clark was ok as Sarah Conner although of course nothing like Linda Hamilton in either of the first two movies. Just another reboot attempt to cash in. Worth watching if you already have a prime membership and don't taking it too seriously.

7302394,3,B01013C5IU,"This movie of the franchise fall short of the original for several reasons.
While the original movie had a small production budget compared to later movies in the series it made up for it with great actors/actresses, great direction and storyline.
In addition it had the freedom of a R rated movie to depict action the way a PG 13 movie can't.
I understand the studios move in order to bring in a wider audience to the theater but it hampered the action of this action movie.
Secondly Hollywood's infatuation casting British actors for what is clearly a story told from the American perspective hurts it as well.
The actor playing John Conner is so bad you can hear his British accent, what gives ?
In this movie the soldiers of the future had hi tech. looking uniforms yet in the original movie the people were starving, dirty and had ragged clothes to wear and eating rats to survive.
The people of the future in Genisys look healthy, clean and well dressed, not very realistic.
Bottom line ... it's okay to watch when nothing else is on TV but if the studio wan't to continue the franchise they have to get back to the gritty realistic feel the original one had.",1471219200,,1165,4.5260663507109005

7302410,1,B01013C5IU,"The rules of a sci-fi universe are fairly simple. The rules of the world are presented, whatever they may be, and as long as the story respects those rules all is well. Sharks can be unleashed upon the world via tornado. A man and a fly can be genetically melded because of a mishap with a teleporter. It doesn't matter. Whatever IT is it will be accepted, regardless of how fantastical. If those rules are broken then credibility and suspension of disbelief go out the window. These thoughts are all I was left with after watching this abomination. Big budget, small thoughts, poor execution, and lots of things blowing up. As a far more entertaining alternative for a fraction of the time, I recommend buying a pack of fireworks and strapping them to a Roomba.",1471132800,2,762,4.651851851851852

And it revels in the fact that nothing makes any sense. Don't stop to ask how/why/when, just appreciate the absurdity. I'm pretty sure what's how the director approached this, and it was absolutely the smartest way to go about it.

Michael Biehn did such a stellar job in the original Terminator film that only an actor who more closely resembles his appearance, vocal characteristics and mannerisms can bring the necessary impact to the story.  It is tragic that Emilia Clarke refuses to portray Sarah Connor in the originally planned sequels.  This movie is far better than the critics say it is.

Seriously...the guy who played Kyle Reese was just awful. Plot had more holes in it than Swiss cheese.  Everyone including Emile Clarke was just so unbelievable and zero chemistry.

No idea how or why Arnold Schwarzenegger would have even considered doing this movie unless he felt his ego needed it. Well guess what...his ego had to take a beating on that decision.

7302912,3,B01013C5IU,"Not Bad At All For Newcomers, But A Letdown For Longtime Enthusiasts

Looks like the franchise will have to settle for being one of the great film TRILOGIES of all time, since part four was unwatchable, and this one, the fifth in the series, is a very extreme but only mildly-successful attempt to reprise the former glory. Starts off nearly the same as the original, then moves to a completely different timeline where - get this - John Connor is THE VILLAIN - a silly and needless twist to the classic story. Nice to have Schwarzenegger back in his role from (I think, with all this alternative timeline voodoo , who really knows?) the remarkably good third film. And the rest of the new cast (standing in for Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, and John) are all very good in their misbegotten new roles. Newcomers might well be entertained, but those of us who've loved the franchise from the start are likely to be let down.",1470700800,,919,4.569696969696969

Really the reason why this movie flopped at the theater was the marketing, the commercials show the who thing. However, that doesn't decrease the fun of the ride.

They did a twist of the previous versions, that actually made you think about the future, and how it would play out.  I liked the way the scene where the terminator from the 1984 episode was blended into the alternate 1984 in this episode.  The computer graphic generated 1984 ""Arnold"" was very convincing in appearance.  And, who could argue about the little snippets of comic relief from the ""old, but not obsolete"" Arnold?
I thought this was a great addition to the Terminator series.",1470700800,,602,4.805825242718447
7303048,4,B01013C5IU,"I really did enjoy this movie. Enough so, that I bought it. I can't give it five stars, yet, because it is just finding its legs. But, overall, this movie is really good. I mean, how many times can someone ""save John Connor?"" Seriously?!? I cared what happened to these people. Everyone except John Connor. I understand why he should have been targeted by Skynet as Its ultimate hope... Who better to infiltrate Sarah and Kyle than their son. But, he was annoying. I didn't care for him as a soldier and I didn't care for him as a Terminator. But, everybody else rocked. I believe that with getting rid of John Connor as the main theme of the Terminator movies going forward is smart. Bring him and his parents back together during the third and final installment, when they figure out how to reverse the future back to the past or something like that.

Arnold surprised me. He did a fantastic job in this movie. But, do I believe he carried it like some others do--NO! He did what he was supposed to do when you bring Arnold back: Give us nostalgia AND lurch us forward into a new Terminator ""future."" He held the movie together, I will say that much. He was the center that everyone else worked off or around to achieve a really good movie, considering there is just so many places to visit with this type of movie. The movie did what it was suppose to do. Give us old Terminator fans something to remember about the first two or three or all of the past movies??? And, give the new kids joining the Terminator bandwagon a glimpse into the past, an understanding of the old movies, while transporting us and them into the future Terminator genre. I hope that they can figure out what we all want (80%, at least), stop worrying about the mega profits and just get back to the business of making movies for enjoyment sake and not for profits alone.

Overall, I recommend this new installment of the Terminator world.",1470700800,2,1916,4.4714285714285715

Not a re-boot. This is after the humans had won and taken control of the time machine in the future. Immediately after that, the machines send terminators back - just like you saw in terminator 2.

7303415,5,B01013C5IU,It placed a very good twist on the story line.,1470700800,,46,3.7
7303416,4,B01013C5IU,"Perhaps the reason I thought Terminator Genisys was hard to follow is because I had no idea there was a fourth Terminator movie called Salvation released in 2009.  I thought Genisys was the first film since Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.  With that said, the theme of Genisys is deception.  I remember certain characters were occasionally deceiving in the first three Terminator movies, but in Genisys the concept of one character turning their back on another is quite the common occurrence!

You have Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays an old obsolete terminator.  At least his character is consistent.  The same can be said for the gorgeous Emilia Clarke.  She trusts Arnold but doesn't trust any human, and presents herself as a stable fighter and survivor.  I had a clueless moment.  I thougt Emilia played Sarah Connor all along from the very first movie but that's not possible since she wasn't even born the time the first movie came out in 1984, haha.  Then again maybe I'm confusing her with Lena Headey from the Sarah Connor Chronicles, the short-lived (underrated!) program that aired on Fox from 2009-2010!  Perhaps Genisys should have kept Linda Hamilton as lead female to clear up any confusion.  Would have been more consistent that way at least.

Anyway yes, betrayal and deception dominates Terminator Genisys.  I won't spoil too much, but Jai Courtney's character is supposed to travel through time to meet up with Sarah Connor.  He discusses his encounter with Jason Clarke (speaking of deception and not knowing who's on who's side, Jason fits that role very well, and ends up playing a very big part of the story in the second half and in fact dominates the story by that point) realizing Sarah won't recognize or remember who he is.  However upon arrival she *does* recognize Jai.  They don't get along at first because they can't see eye to eye on how to reset the future because the timeline's messed up.  Jai wants to travel to 2017 but Sarah insists they should go to 1997.  Jai convinces her that his point of view is the right one based on things he shouldn't have knowledge of which encourages Sarah to change her mind.  Yeah... confusing stuff.

This is a SPOILER.  The reason Jason Clarke ends up playing a big role later is because he's the son of Sarah and Jai who had a baby in a different timeline.  Once this realization is revealed, the story gets quite confusing and almost feels like a soap opera.  Good machines fighting bad machines, good people fighting bad machines, bad people fighting good machines!  So much going on!  Otherwise Terminator Genisys has another flaw, that being it uses Matrix effects to slow down the gunshots, jumps, attacks and machine oozing moments that occur throughout the movie.  I'm not a fan of the Matrix and would have preferred the speed hadn't been altered.

Also I was hoping the CGI effects would have stayed away since they once again look cheesy and more of a detriment just like how they were used in Jurassic World.  It makes building/city destruction look less believable.  Anyway Genisys... what an interesting word!  What does it mean you're probably wondering?  It's an operating system developed by Cyberdyne Systems to connect private, public and military networks.  This is why even kids are using it, though again, I got confused figuring out how the child characters we'd occasionally see tie into the story.

Otherwise this is your typical exciting Terminator movie with a pretty good amount of action and perhaps more emphasis on storyline this time around.  Also who was Lee Byung-hun?  Obviously a Terminator, I didn't understand his purpose other than to rummage through a clothing store and try to attack Jai and Arnold Schwarzenegger only to fail miserably.  No doubt he played a part in Salvation.  Perhaps the action got a little *too* overbearing by the end with the helicopter chase.  Even I thought this was too much by this point (with a bland Arnold leap onto the helicopter below... meh).  I like the scene with the bus hanging off the Golden Gate bridge.  I felt my adrenaline rushing during this scene, though it was sort of laughable how John's character was hanging and climbing from the bottom of it, lol.  Prior to this he even threw a motorcycle on top of the bus creating the false impression he was on the roof, so Arnold and Jai point their guns above.  He's below fellows!

The movie flashes back to the first two Terminator movies, but to be honest I'd have to watch those movies again because I can't tell if the characters are reenacting the scenes or if Genisys is simply copying those segments.  Arnold looks young with black hair so I'm guessing the movie is simply lifting the same exact scenes from the first two movies and applying them here.

Anyway I enjoy Emila Clarke and think she's *very* good at her role, and in fact I enjoy all the actors.  Perhaps this film is one too many though, and the Terminator films should have ended with Salvation or Rise of the Machines.  I can't say for sure having never watched Salvation, but the feeling is that it's becoming too much.  Too much Terminator!  Of course J.K Simmons character has to be involved in the law department, just like from Law & Order!  I guess it makes sense.  His character is meant for law.  Enjoyed the hospital scene where Jai and Sarah were able to lie their way out of getting arrested for not having any identification since they're time travellers after all, even though Jai's explanation didn't make much sense.

Maybe in the next Terminator movie Arnold can be a bad Terminator again.  I think I've had enough of the nice guy machine.  Anyway Genisys doesn't have any truly frightening scenes, or memorable fight scenes (though they're usually chase anyway scenes until the very final one between Arnold and John Clarke) so with that in mind -plus the sometimes confusing storyline- I'm giving the movie 4 stars.  Usually in Terminator movies there's one or two REALLY cool effects, but the closest we get here is when Jason walks out of a building on fire and slowly returns to his normal self while people stand around and watch in disbelief.  Still a highly recommended movie.",1470614400,,6185,4.786591123701605

Great actors, nice effects, cool explosions; however, as a whole, they movie kind of fell just a little flat. Not sure what it was.

I thoroughly enjoyed Schwarzenegger's character and they way they accounted for the actor's age. But Clarke... Honestly, I can't tell whether she was doing a poor job acting, or whether she'd simply been written badly. But it was hard to look at her because she was too purposefully beautiful. Her character has been living a pretty rough life for the past eight years  but she still has time to get her lips injected and she has such a lovely complexion. It reminds me of movies where the action hero always has perfect hair, no matter what he'd just been through. Details matter. Maybe in certain circles of Hollywood, silicone lips are so common that the director didn't even notice. But no one was doing it in the early 80s  even those who could take time off from their busy Terminator-fleeing lifestyle to visit a cosmetologist. And for me, that was just one too many retcons.

* No way machines would need terminators to wipe out humanity that survived the nukes; change the humans to  mutants... Say, X-men, or the like... Hmmm, crossover here?
* I struggle with shows that include time travel. Too many what 'ifs'... and what did Whitman say?

Anyway, it's a SciFi flick, and done pretty well. The CGI wasn't too obnoxious so totally worth watching...",1470009600,,968,4.385474860335195

If you were a fan of the first three terminator movies (I try to forget number four), then you will most likely enjoy this one. The fact that Arnold plays an aged terminator makes it easy for him to slide right back into the roll of a T-800. Jai Courtney does an excellent job of portraying Kyl Reese. My only complaint is the choice of Jason Clarke as John Connor. He portrays the role very well, but he just does not visually fit the role.

7303643,4,B01013C5IU,"This movie is not as bad as most reviews would seem to suggest, if you are a fan of the original movie. This one plays proper homage to that one while heading off in a new direction. Nothing will top the original of course, or even T2 but this one is as least as good as T3, which admittedly isn't saying a whole. And far better than the awful Terminator Salvation. I don't care much for the new Sarah Conner or Kyle Reese since the originals were the best. And I have really come to despise the whole, women MUST be the HERO of every single movie Hollywood produces now, being saved by men in any way is strictly forbidden. But at least they don't beat you over the head with here, as in the Mad Maxine reboot. The storyline here is a bit mangled since they have to tie it in knots to get into a new timeline for the reboot. None of it makes a lot of sense. But never mind. There's lot of action and Arnold at least gets to play a version of the Terminator that is his real age.

I don't really know what the problem is and don't have a lot of time too mess with settings and stuff so sorry Arnold for the 1 Star! amazon on the other hand-' wss up wit dat'? the TV plays Netflix set top box, cable and satellite fine. perhaps ill try once more on my other set that has amazon built in to the receiver and see what happens.",1469836800,2,607,3.7874015748031495

7303865,5,B01013C5IU,The movie tied up some of the loose ends of the other movies. The new Arnold was funny with some great lines.  I enjoyed it,1469750400,,123,3.92
7303866,4,B01013C5IU,Great movie.  Some leaps in logic but it IS a movie about lifelike robots set to kill or protect humanity so you can't really expect accuracy.,1469750400,,142,4.461538461538462

Terminator 3 and 4 felt slightly off, but were decent. Terminator Genisys (5) is definitely more in line with 1 and 2. Highly recommended! Put to rest the terminator series.

Terminator 1&2 are my all time favorite action/sci-fi movie and T2 was basically my favorite movie growing up as a kid pretty much still is .  With that being said, every other persons review on here is like a long boring novel, so I am gonna keep this short and simple. This movie is garbage, don't waste your time. Like I previously stated, Terminator (1 & 2 and I did enjoy Salvation a little)  is my favorite since I was in 2nd grade and I had to push pause 20 times in the first 45 minutes and debate whether or not I wanted to finish the damn thing. The burning question I had in my head the whole time watching Genesis,  Why did they make this movie?",1469664000,,749,4.074829931972789

I never really cared for the first ones, they were far too violent and gloomy and very tiring to watch.  The story is just as ominous, but with the little comedic relief brought on by Arnold's character, it really helped make the movie more enjoyable and easier to watch.
We watched it at the theater last year, and decided to watch it again on Amazon.  It is such a complicated movie, I didn't remember as much as I thought I would, and it was like seeing a new movie!  Highly recommend.",1469664000,,564,4.384615384615385

Although it's an okay action flick on its own, if you loved the first two films this 5th installment might make you sad and a little confused.  Thanks to time travel, the original two films' story line is twisted and contorted in an effort
to refresh the franchise.  Too much twisting if you ask me.  The acting is sometimes flat, especially Jai Courtney.  Arnold gets to ham up a bit.  Jason Clarke does a good job in his role.  Watch it just for the action movie ride and you'll have a little fun.",1469664000,,545,4.233009708737864

Maybe Chris Nolan or JJ Abrams can try to update this storyline.

The best parts where the call-backs to the 1984 movie, and even those ween't that great, Pretty low budget looking CGI removes andy sense of tension or emotional involvement in what are meant to be ""pulse pounding"" action sequences. Ugh, man, I can't even finish this review.

If you have a few hours to kill and a morbid sense of curiosity, give this a watch. If you want a well written addition to the already bloated and non-sensical Terminator canon, give it a pass.

As a final note, it is hilarious that Matt Smith is Skynet, because the way they handle all the time travel and causality issues is about as well thought out as a typical Dr. Who episode.",1469664000,,696,4.604838709677419

The movie had a good pace and flow.
It stayed away from excessive nudity, cursing and over-the-top characters which is so common. The female lead was strong without being an unbelievable super-human (I.e. Angelina J in Salt).

7304066,3,B01013C5IU,"Arnold Schwarzenegger was good, very good.  The young woman who played Sarah Connor was god awful!  She brought absolutely no intensity to the character.  She was just bland!  Everybody else was just ok.  The special effects were just ok Compared to previous versions.  It's now 2015 you'd expect the special effects to be spectacular!!

If u hadn't seen the previous versions, you won't appreciate many areas of the film.  Without any previous knowledge, the film would be pretty choppy.  If Arnold wasn't in it to keep us entertained throughout the bulk of the movie, it would be a sneeze away from being a box office flop/dud.  Looking at it that way, I guess the Terminator truly does save the day in the end! LOL.

Good if you've seen some/all of the other Terminator movies.  Great for nostalgic viewers.  Skip it if u haven't seen any of the other movies.

While the time travel wrinkles still have me a bit baffled, and some of the plot twists were a bit disappointing, it was a fun, exciting story for fans.  NOTE:  PG-13 seems to mean that movies are allowed to us the F word once in a movie, and the studios never seem to miss the opportunity to use it at least once, so if you are watching this with kids, be fore warned.  Also, it would be best to watch T1 and T2 if you haven't seen them before, or to rewatch them if it has been a long time, because this movie utilizes the audience's memory of events from those movies to make this one more significant.",1469577600,,660,4.173228346456693

7304240,3,B01013C5IU,It didn't hold my interest.  At some point you have to stop with the sequel..... I think it's time.,1469491200,,99,4.2105263157894735
7304241,4,B01013C5IU,Surprisingly good movie.  Lot of references to the older movies if you seen the movie series.,1469491200,,93,4.8125
7304242,4,B01013C5IU,Not bad at all,1469491200,,14,2.75
7304243,4,B01013C5IU,I started watching but was afraid the movie would be another one of those over the hill sagas of heroes past their prime doing unrealistic things for their age. But they put together a scenario that was fun to watch with the younger players carrying most of the load but the wise old terminator was very much in the mix. As the old terminator states many times throughout the movie (I am old not obsolete). It stayed on track and had a nice ending. I think it was a good fit after all previous terminator movies.,1469491200,,512,4.34375
7304244,4,B01013C5IU,Good story line with plenty of action!,1469491200,,38,4.571428571428571

Batman isn't in this one which is good and bad because the turd playing John C. Doesn't look anything like a bad A$$ resistance leader.

7304488,3,B01013C5IU,"Terminator 5 is an entertaining action popcorn movie. It has some interesting ideas, but is trying to do too much. It could have scaled back and built up better tension and emotional resonance. Changing the leads may have helped, as Emilia Clarke took awhile to get into the groove of Sarah Connor, Jai Courtney didn't add much, Arnold was slightly wasted and Jason Clarke was also slightly wasted. The film ended up being an amalgam of everything that came before it and barely adding anything new.

However, the visuals and action were entertaining and I'd gladly have seen more movies in this direction, though it appears that won't be happening any time soon.",1469404800,,663,4.867256637168142

7304491,5,B01013C5IU,"I liked this! I don't think it would be very entertaining if you aren't intimately familiar with the Terminator storyline as there are numerous references to the earlier films. I think you would be incredibly lost and confused trying to figure out what's going on. (As confused as I was trying to figure out how they made Arnold look young again) But as I am intimately familiar with the story, and all the references made sense to me, I loved this!

To be frank, this is not as good as the epic Terminator 2 Judgement Day. That was the best film in the franchise on many different levels. Best effects. Best story. It is the gold standard of human killing cyborg movies. Genisys doesn't try to be that same kind of film. This is more of an action movie, with the ""must save Sarah Connor"" plotline being somewhat secondary to the explosions and gun play. On that level it's a good action movie.

And even though this is an action movie first, there story is still interesting. It's kind of like the new Star Trek movies, where it's a total reboot of the storyline due to time traveling messing with things earlier in the timeline. But the characters are the same people and it all works out.

This film makes significant reference to the original Terminator movie. T2 Judgement Day is references but not as significantly as the timeline has been altered to the point where the events of T2 are significantly changed. T3 is largely ignored because it's too far down the path of the alternate timeline. And Terminator Salvation is rightfully treated as though nothing from it ever occurred. (Because that movie was just god awful)

Matt Smith has a surprisingly small role, considering how globally huge he was in Doctor Who. But he does that role well.

Emilia Clarke takes over the roll of Sarah Connor. I think she does a great job. She gives a believable rendition of the character that works well with the original way Linda Hamilton portrayed her. I also enjoy the irony of Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaren) and Lena Heady (Cersei Lannister) both reprising the same character in Sarah Connor. (Heady played her in the FOX TV show The Sarah Connor Chronicles)

Make sure you watch through the end of the credits. There is an easter egg at the end.",1469404800,,2250,4.64070351758794

Acting from all of the actors was great; but the story line was jacked. Nothing in the future will affect the past. But things in the past will affect the future. As the past had changed radically, the future would have followed these changes. Meaning Sarah would have instilled said changes in John to insure he could deflect being turned into a terminator. I was very disappointed in the story line. Every sci-fi fan worth their salt recalls when Marty changed the past in back to the future; he and Doc Brown returned to a very different future. T-Genisys would have us believe that my changing the future the past will change as well... makes no sense.",1469404800,2,789,4.410958904109589

And that might be this movie's (and the franchise in general) biggest failing: this was just another movie instead of the spectacle that we expect from a Terminator movie.  The attempt to reboot the franchise with new stars was a valiant one, but fell short due to the aforementioned muddled collapse/consolidation/confusion of the differing timelines as well as the actors that were chosen to carry the reboot.  I like all the actors, but they just didn't have the gravitas of Linda Hamilton and Andy Biehn or even Edward Furlong.  If Arnold is your best actor, then you've got some issues.

Overall, middle of the road action fare that might have been better if it hadn't had the Terminator tag to live up to.",1469404800,,907,4.64375

Each of these movies since the second movie has you trying to wrap your head around what you thought you already knew.
Arnold is at his usual stoic best as a terminator.  The usual low key humor helps you enjoy the film.  Emilio Clarke's portrayal of Sarah Connor is great.  She really captures the essence of original actress Linda Hamilton.

7304543,3,B01013C5IU,"This movie was surprisingly enjoyable.  I've been a huge fan of the terminator series and have had the misfortune of seeing them all.  It really peaked with T2 and should have ended there but understandable that Hollywood wouldn't let it die, because - y'know, money.  Mini-rant aside, I didn't have high hopes for this one.  The trailer gave a lot away and it seemed like they were trying to squeeze the last few drops of money out of what seemed a very exhausted franchise.  The formula hasn't changed much. Robots rise up against humans, humans fight back, Robots go back in time, Chase Sequence, humans win...or did they?  Rinse, Repeat.

This movie isn't much different but what is does do well is the pacing.  The action is good and keeps your attention, the FX are a tolerable and the CGI will definitely show down the line (it looks like the budget really took a hit in this department).  The acting is good and we get a few nice scenes by Arnold and cast.  If somehow this movie was separated from the Terminator universe, it would have been better.  It's a great popcorn action flick to toss on when you don't have much to do and want to veg out for a few and watch some people get chased around and stuff explode.",1469404800,,1224,4.468468468468468

The idea must of been  so how can we make a new terminator movie and include Arnold , some new actors to appeal to  millennials and oh yes some crazy ass story. The  Kyle Reece character is a real whiner, the chemistry between Sara and Kyle is forced ,at least Arnold is consistent.",1469318400,,362,4.4393939393939394

I don't know, everyone is pretty on point in this movie but the story is a little convoluted, as time travel movies often are, and I feel like I had more questions than answers by the end of it.

Either way, if you're a fan of the franchise you'll enjoy it enough that you don't hate yourself for watching it. If you're looking for something as thought provoking as T2, just go watch that instead and stop acting surprised that the movies since then haven't been as good.",1469318400,,561,4.242990654205608

His expressions, oddly appropriate one-liners, and body language evoke laughter In the midst of intense, high stakes efforts to ensure Skynet doesn't rewrite the past. I didn't like the casting of Jai Courtney as Reese or is shrill approach to the role. The original's Michael Biehn was more likeable and his bravery more believable. Emilia Clarke did a better job of filling Linda Hamilton's shoes. A few interesting twists, but also overly fantastic explanations.

Then we get T3 and TSalvation. Not ""bad"" movies as far as actioners go, but not memorable as far as John's character goes.  Then we get TGen and Jason Clarke kills me with both his humanity, vulnerability and ruthlessness as his dual sided John. I would have loved to see the a movie all about him.
