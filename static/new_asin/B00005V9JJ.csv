7956201,5,B00005V9JJ,What are the 4 movies? 1. Fighting Caravans starring Gary Cooper and Lily Damita. 2. The Light Of Western Stars starring Victor Jory & Russel Hayden. 3. Drift Fence starring Buster Crabbe & Tom Keene. 4. Heritage Of The Desert starring Randolph Scott in his first starring role! These classics speak for themselves. I am a western fan who loved every one of these.,1107561600,8,364,4.703125
