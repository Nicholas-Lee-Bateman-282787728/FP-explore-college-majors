OK.  I am adding on to my review as I hadn't watched this film before I came to it's defense.  (So, hit me already.) Obviously my defense was for the original film THE MUMMY, however, this one is of value to me because of the information/interview with Boris Karloff's daughter.  I found this fascinating and a treasure I will keep.  The other info was fun esp with the double entendres (spelling?) and fun take-off on Elvira.  The last interview was great, too.  All in all, I liked it and am glad I bought it",1465516800,,758,4.514705882352941
8249452,1,B00138YKL8,Amateurish home movie level . Very disappointing.,1463616000,,49,6.142857142857143
8249453,1,B00138YKL8,"This is not the great Karloff film. This is only a short (30-minute) documentary about the film--and a very lame one at that, barring the interview with Sara Karloff.",1225584000,5,166,4.758620689655173
8249454,5,B00138YKL8,"Many, many years ago, my family and I who came from ""the land beyond, beyond, the land past hope and fear"" owned and operated the very first fast food chain called ""Hannibal's""! ""Imhotep"" as I was known to my friends and regular customers, developed a method of seer-ing and slow roasting mummies that would have my people coming from miles around on their lunch breaks(from building the pyramids)to sample my delectable ""Yummy Mummy"" sandwich!

Seer-ed on an open pit, then slow roasted in a oven with just the right amount of tana leaves, leaving the inside tender and falling apart, but making the bandages crisp and full of crackling flavor! Folks could enjoy this tasty treat while listening to the works of Han's J Salter and Frank Skinner that was piped in to this pioneering establishment.

The tana leaves were a new addition to our family recipe, that seemed to work well with our new sandwich additions ""Yummy Mummy Hand"" sandwich and our ""Yummy Mummy' Tomb which was a heaping bowl of our signature Mummy flesh in a tomb shaped bowl if you will, then covered with a Jack Pierce spearmint gum sauce.

Our ""Yummy Mummy"" sandwich is celebrating an Anniversary and has a ""new and improved"" taste with a crispier Transfer and new extra dripping with delicious atmosphere!

This one's for you Metamorpho for the many enjoyable hours of reading your wonderful ""reviews""

Metamorpho for PREZ! :-)

I wrote this review to add to the Universal The Mummy 75th anniversay release of the original film, but I already reviewed the first release of that film and Amazon groups all the releases together so..........I put it under this niffty little non profit Mummy 75th tribute DVD which is very cool!",1223942400,3,1699,4.841379310344828
8249455,1,B00138YKL8,This would warrant zero stars if it were not for the Karloff interview and it was a non profit production. Half the DVD is on how the DVD was made!,1219017600,,147,3.933333333333333
8249456,5,B00138YKL8,What Perry Shields has done for the memory of the Universal Classic Horror Genre is nothing short of greatness. This is one not to be missed. Add this one to your collection.,1201737600,,174,4.46875
