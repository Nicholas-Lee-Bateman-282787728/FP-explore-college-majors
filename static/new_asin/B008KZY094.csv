5372557,5,B008KZY094,"This unusual movie is intriguing and enjoyable.  A unique mix of horror, drama and suspense.  The way the story wraps around itself at the end is both chilling and heartbreaking.  I think I'll have to watch it again to better understand how the girl's trauma grapples with the ""evil in the well.""",1481328000,4,296,4.653846153846154
5372558,4,B008KZY094,Pretty interesting view of psychological trauma and consequences of emotional stress.,1481068800,,85,6.818181818181818

5372560,5,B008KZY094,"Dead Soon is a creepy and compelling exploration of psychosis. From the opening sequence, we're drawn into a riveting, surreal world. What really happened at the well? Is Alena telling the truth, or is she making it all up? The film accomplishes that rare achievement: we really care about the main character, and her psychological process is intelligently drawn. As the film progresses to its devastating conclusion, we're with it all the way. Strongly recommend.",1361059200,2,464,5.2
5372561,5,B008KZY094,"this film proves that there are still movies out there with substance . Good writing , good casting .....I've recommended this film to at least 3 people. I really enjoyed the commentary with writer ,director Michael Morris. Fun stuff. ....wouldnt surprise me if this film became a cult classic......just say's.....",1356220800,2,314,5.3
5372562,4,B008KZY094,"The movie starts out pretty fast with the chase scene to the well.  As the mystery builds around what is tormenting the girl, it begins to twist and turn into different possible answers for what lies beneath.  Aleece Jones is an actress to watch.  This is definitely low-budget indie fare, but I was relieved it didn't follow the typical indie horror formula.  More of a thinking person's puzzle.",1355702400,,396,4.779411764705882
5372563,4,B008KZY094,"This film was made for very low budget, but the production value is first rate. Not a mere gore-fest, this is a journey into a psychological rabbit hole, and the lead actress is excellent.",1354924800,,188,4.5588235294117645

8545270,5,B008KZY094,"I give it five stars!
The movie is 100% metaphoric.

Spoilers ahead.
The people who metaphorically died were prob. people in her life that she hurt...
She was already damaged and saw people close to her as the enemy.
Not a lot of ""neat effects""...
it's just a story!",1488844800,,266,4.428571428571429
8545271,3,B008KZY094,"Flashbacks have their place, but seeing the same scene two or three times gets very boring. The story was good and I really liked Aleece Jones. Certainly not the worst I've seen.",1487980800,,178,4.59375
8545272,1,B008KZY094,"Some low. I'd get movies are quite good, but this one isn't, there's no reason to watch. ",1485388800,,89,4.235294117647059

8545276,4,B008KZY094,"This is a bizarre movie.  It is interesting, gripping, somewhat confusing, but in a good and mysterious way.  I am reminded of the first few times I saw the ancient classic, ""Carnival of Souls.""  If you liked Carnival of Souls, I think you will enjoy this movie.  It is offbeat, unusual and probably won't appeal to some, but I found it entertaining and a uniquely told story.",1482019200,2,376,4.567164179104478
