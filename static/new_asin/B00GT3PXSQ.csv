I thought it was reasonably priced for such a large collection, inclucing the extra movies. Not being a fan, though, I have no comment on the content.",1427932800,,265,3.925925925925926

8627267,2,B00GT3PXSQ,"First the Good. It is good to see this old Western favorite appear in DVD. Amidst all the other offers for this series, this one is a direct transfer and has six bonus full length ""Djando"" movies. The other series are DVD-R. I spoke to TGG production company about this and they helped guide me to this particular set. The Bad: The packaging of this series comes in four clam-shell boxes, each containing four discs. However, they are stacked on a central spindle which is a wee too short to hold them all. Hence any movement and the top two discs are likely to come off, leaving discs loose in the box, with the inevitable scratching of discs. The marketplace supplier was most helpful and immediately sent out a replacement set but the same thing occurred again. The Ugly: While TGG stated it will replace any discs that don't play or skips, the customer is left with the expense of sending discs to them at his/her own expense, and if they want discs stored safely the expense of buying replacement clam shells where each disc sits on its own hub. A classic case of poor production/manufacturing. It those extra expenses don't bother you, this is the set to get.",1416700800,8,1165,4.578947368421052
