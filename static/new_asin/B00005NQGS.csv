7947643,5,B00005NQGS,I always enjoy anything Judi Dench. Seeing her with Michael was wonderful. It is a sweet comedy and I loved it.,1374969600,,111,4.333333333333333
7947644,3,B00005NQGS,"A typical British comedy, although not as funny as ""Fawlty Towers"" or ""Are you Being Served?"", it still is hilarious in most cases. A willing woman and a doubtful man. What a combination!",1321056000,,187,4.696969696969697
7947645,4,B00005NQGS,"This is a series you can watch over and over again--anything with Dame Judi Dench is a sure winner---I am lucky enough to own just about everything she has ever been in,I guess-- from this series it went on to AS Time Goes By and then Cranford--hopefully she will continue for years to come !!!!",1282694400,,295,4.381818181818182
7947646,5,B00005NQGS,"Judi Dench is a joy to watch and together with her in-real-life husband Michael Williams they are a perfect foil for each other.  While sometimes it appears a bit dated the co-stars and guest stars produce a wonderful series.  The whole four part series is a must view for anyone who really enjoys good british programming.  I have purchased the whole series because I had such great memories from watching it in the eighties.  I must say it does not disappoint.  The comic timing is pure genius.

A must view.",1181001600,,510,4.611111111111111
7947647,4,B00005NQGS,"I have already had the occasion to review the first two sets of the Britcom called ""A Fine Romance"" with Judi Dench and real life spouse Michael Williams as a goofy couple who meet, fall in love, cohabit, but never quite get around to the question of marriage. In fact, their failure to communicate what is on their minds motivated the earlier episodes as much as Hamlet's indecision is the basis of that story.

 At the time, I commented how refreshing it was to see Dame Judi play a less than mature woman who solves problems by hiding in closets or running off to Europe. Indeed it is with a sudden trip to Brussels that episode 19 begins and the next seven involve the dithering attempts of Williams to propose finally (under the most Monty Pythonesque of circumstances) and her attempts to cope with the final commitment.
 Unhappily, the basic joke is stretched far too long over the 8 episodes in this set; and the two become merely annoying after a while. Granted, Dench can set the table at a roar with the slightest movement of an eyebrow, and some of her double takes are classic. However, even she cannot carry a storyline stretched far too thinly.
 So I go to only 4 out of 5 stars on this one, but I assure you that there are still more laughs per tape-inch in this 3rd set than in most juvenile American sitcoms.",1000166400,20,1326,4.466942148760331
