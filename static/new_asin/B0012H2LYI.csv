8245951,4,B0012H2LYI,"I'm a big Twins fan and Gillian Chung being my favorite. This is not a bad little horror flick from Hong Kong from 2007. Loaded with college hotties and of course my hottie Gillian Chung. So the movie is about a bunch of hot college coeds going amok, all hell's breakin lose kinda stuff. Not the best horror film out there, but does have its scary moments. And for me, any film with Gillian is a must have!",1412294400,,406,4.217948717948718
