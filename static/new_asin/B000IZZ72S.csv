It is the most arcane & little understood branch. They are well done, informative & worth the while of any citizen who might like to learn something of our government. Three Supreme Court Judges speak & then entertain a Q&A session with questions fron high school or college students.  It did reinforce my belief that The United States is indeed a Happy Accident of history. A covergence of time, place & people that created a document we have lived under for 220 years & going strong. It may be the most influential & important piece of work this side of the New Testamant. It easily could have failed in another time without this particular blend of men. They were plutocrats to be sure but with the Bill of Rights & ammendments added from time to time make it a document for all of the people. Not a perfect document, it was written by imperfect men. But along with the faith of Americans it survived even the most strenuous of challanges, The Civil War.
  Actually the third dvd was a bit more entertaining, at least to me citing specific cases that came before the court.

The questions presented are well thought out and answered in a language understood by youth in today's society.

I would highly recommend this to Jr. high school and especially high school teachers as an aid in explaining our country's Constitution and federal system.",1233705600,,497,5.371794871794871
