8079732,1,B000ATJND6,"I ordered this film, as I have run out of stock, since a few years.
I was involved myself in the making of this movie (see [...]), and I know how the original film looked like.
The technical quality of this DVD is simply unacceptable. The image is blurry, and there's hardly any contrast. It has become one grey look, certainly far away from the original.",1346976000,,355,4.393939393939394
8079733,5,B000ATJND6,"When reviewing dance, it can, at times, be difficult to classify the choreography as ballet, modern ballet, modern dance, jazz. etc.  In this case it is simple: this is pure modern dance.  The term is difficult to define exactly, but if you see enough of it, you get the idea.  This dance film is called ""Achterland"", and is performed by the dance company, Rosas. The choreographer is Anne Teresa De Keersmacher.  The dancing is very light hearted and a little comical, but very interesting, usuing all types of groupings, from solos to full ensemble.  The music is quite noteworthy: Eugene Ysaye's unaccompanied violin sonatas and Gyorgy Ligeti's piano etudes.  They are played onstage by Irvine Arditti(violin) and Rolf Hind(piano).  There is some slight intereaction between the dancers and the musicians, which adds to the comical nature of the dancing.  There are some routines involving women and their high heel shoes.  They act kind of sexy walking around and also take them off and put them on.  It's amusing!  The dancing is done on a stage with no sets or background, other than the studio, itself.  The dancers are wearing ordinary clothes.  The camera is not a special feature as in a ""dance-for-camera"" film, but simply records the action.  These factors give the film the look of a rehearsal documentary, but this is not a documentary.  This aspect tends to cause the viewer to relax and focus on the choreography(perhaps it has the same effect on the dancers!).  The sound quality is excellent, but this film is shot in black and white, on 35mm, Fuji film.  It was filmed in Brussels in 1993, but it looks like the black and white films of the 1950's!  It has a slightly grainy look.  I don't understand how this can be, since 35mm, Fuji film should give a much better result.  Anyway, the image quality is good, but if you are looking for that digital sparkle on your screen, you will be disappointed.  If you are a modern dance fan and you don't mind black and white films, this is highly recommended.",1153785600,13,2019,4.744252873563219
