174903,5,1401927297,"I think this is an awesome DVD for getting back into the the routine of exercise. You can increase and vary excercise patterns of all the exercises on the DVD at your own pace. Coach Nicole breaks the routines down at a very nice pace. Each set is about 10 minutes until you customize your own set up of the DVD exercises. Very nice exercise DVD! Supports some of the goals covered in ""The Spark"" book by Chris Downe.",1265846400,13,417,4.291139240506329
174904,3,1401927297,"I would have enjoyed knowing how this related to people over 60 in terms of difficulty. I've made the effort to attempt all of the exercises, but find some not accommodating to stiff joints.",1264550400,11,190,4.617647058823529
174905,5,1401927297,"This video contains seven 10 minute daily workouts plus a 15 minute aerobic segment.  The first time I did the first workout, that 10 minutes flew by so quickly, I did it again!  I'm far from being in shape so I did have to work at some of the moves but Nicole is sincerely warm and personable and reassuring about different fitness levels working at different rates.  She's a real person; attractive and fit but not one of those glamor models that you know are phony or out to make a buck.  SparkPeople.com is genuinely about the members, not about the founder as some other fitness websites are.  I'll use this DVD every day and enjoy it!",1264291200,73,640,4.435897435897436
174906,5,1401927297,"Once again, Coach Nicole and SparkPeople have put out a great fitness product! I was stuck indoors yesterday because of a snow storm, unable to make it to the gym for my usual strength training and cardio workout, so I popped in the DVD and did a few of the 10-minute workout segments. Let me tell you, Coach Nicole worked me hard! And she did it with that winning smile and wonderful attitude of hers! This DVD is for people of any fitness level; Nicole lets you know how to modify each exercise if you need to and even tells you how to ramp it up if it is too easy! I especially love the ""Strengthen and Lengthen"" segment - it made me feel taller and more flexible after doing it just once.

BONUS: The DVD includes a 15-minute heart-pumping, cardio workout! And guess what? It is FUN! :)",1262908800,52,790,4.302013422818792
174907,5,1401927297,"This DVD makes for a great workout.  Following the program has helped me achieve exactly what it promises, I feel more fit, look a little firmer, and have more energy.  I especially like that all the exercises are scalable.  If you are stronger in one muscle group or movement, you can make it harder and then lower your weight for the next one.  Nicole is very personable and seems more ""real"" than many other fitness DVD personalities.",1262736000,14,437,4.636363636363637
174908,5,1401927297,"Great workout DVD for a ""real"" person. Coach Nicole is so easy to relate to. The exercises are challenging yet doable for any fitness level. Coach Nicole is great at making sure you know how to modify the exercise to your own personal level. Coach Nicole also explains in a way that is easy to understand and follow.

174910,3,1401927297,I like it but its not quite for me-im a little more advanced and I probably should have thought more about this before I bought. but a GREAT video for beginner lifters-I think ill just use heavier weights,1383782400,2,204,4.394736842105263
174911,5,1401927297,"I love these little workouts! Quick, simple, no nonsence, to the point 10 min sessions to fit in when you don't have a lot of time. Also very effective!",1375228800,,152,4.275862068965517
174912,5,1401927297,I love that no matter which workout you chose it includes the warm up and cool down which is really nice.  I have watched Nicole on Spark People and really like her style and commitment to movement.  Always has suggestions on alternate moves to either slow the pace or increase it. All workouts are just 10 minutes which is great when you don't have much time. I have other workout videos by Nicole and I think I like this one the best of all.,1370736000,3,443,4.261904761904762
174913,5,1401927297,I absolutely love it and use it daily.  I have recommended this to many of ;my friends and family and have purchased a second copy for my daughter.  Thank you so much for your fast shipping.,1368230400,,190,4.25
174914,5,1401927297,"Nicole is a great fitness coach. Buy this, do a reasonable diet (really just healthy eating habits) and be on your way to fitness and weight loss. Nicole has been my coach for a few months now. I've went from 250lbs to currently 210lbs since Sept 2012! Check out SparkPeople.com as well!",1367712000,,287,4.538461538461538

174916,5,1401927297,This is really a great DVD.  It really shows how you can exercise for 10 minutes a day.  Sparkpeople is really a great plan.,1357084800,,124,4.125

174925,4,1401927297,I purchased this dvd because I have the 28 day bootcamp dvd and really enjoy it.  This dvd has multiple different 10 minute toning workouts targeting various parts of the body.  It is not a cardio DVD.  It has a very basic production value and is just one person demonstrating exercises.  There is a bonus cardio workout that is about 15 minutes.  I like the Bootcamp DVD better but this is a good supplement.,1336348800,2,409,4.472972972972973
174926,4,1401927297,"I like that the exercises are effective and can be done in 10 minutes.  I did the lower body exercise, but I'm looking forward to trying the other 7 as well.",1333929600,,157,4.064516129032258
174927,2,1401927297,"I was completely out of shape after getting surgery so I wanted something that would not take long and would ease me into it. However these workouts were WAY too easy. I barely even broke a sweat when doing multiple workouts, and I was completely out of shape!  I think this should be geared towards extremely out of shape people.  I wouldn't buy this again.. I don't know how anyone gets anything out of these workouts.",1332720000,7,420,4.5131578947368425
174928,5,1401927297,Quick - short workouts that are easily adjustable to varying fitness levels.  Coach Nicole explains exercises - moves -- when to exhale & inhale -- things to watch out for.  Good instruction - Good program to enhance your established workout or to begin with if you don't have an established workout reigme.,1328400000,,307,4.884615384615385
174929,4,1401927297,"Love this dvd as an add-in to my cardio routine.  Nicole effectively works different body parts in only 10 minutes - so you can do arms one day, abs one day, etc.",1325548800,4,162,4.0625
174930,5,1401927297,"This dvd is ideal for beginners (who have some base fitness level) and intermediate exercisers. Over four months, I have lost 30 lbs by changing to a permanent, healthier diet and exercising (primarily using the dvd everyday and some jogging once or twice a week). One note: You will need weights and a yoga or exercise mat for some exercises on this dvd. This is a good dvd to use to lose weight and maintain a level of general fitness. If you want to get ripped however, this is not the program for you.",1325116800,15,505,4.382978723404255

This Spark DVD is probably my favorite.  Coach Nicole is wonderful - she comes across as your average, fit girl-next-door, not an overly perky, hardbody athletic trainer.  I'm old enough to think of her as a lovely daughter-in-law.  Love the 10-min workout segments and I, too, usually do 3 or 4 of them back-to-back to get a more demanding workout.  The moves are not complicated and are very user-friendly for beginners.  If you're not in good shape, rest assured that Nicole shows or tells you how to simplify almost everything, encouraging you to ""just keep moving.""

174932,5,1401927297,"This is an great dvd from an awesome Healthy living, free site. It will go quite nicely with the Fitness Tracker and my program. Begins with easy exercises for each day of the week.",1319932800,,181,4.352941176470588
174933,5,1401927297,"If you are busy and have 10 minutes to spare, then this is the DVD for you!
Head to toe exercise routines with little to no extra equipment, except a set of dumbbells and a floor mat.  Also a 15 minutes cardio routine.  Excellent DVD.
Kudos Nicole!",1318032000,,248,4.25531914893617

174935,5,1401927297,"Coach Nicole is awesome!  She's informative and motivating without being perky or annoying. She doesn't yell or make you feel inferior.  She shows you easy modifications that will work for any fitness level.  The workouts and stretching each day are about 10 minutes, so you can easily fit in your strength training. Needs little equipment, just a fitness/yoga mat, a chair, and a set of hand weights.",1312416000,4,401,4.955223880597015
174936,5,1401927297,Love this workout video. Its easy and you can fit it in any schedule. You can do as little or as much as you can do. This is a fun and simple workout video! A must have for anyone!,1309651200,,180,3.641025641025641
174937,5,1401927297,"Most of us don't have a lot of extra time to exercise and/or are pretty new to exercise.  This video is great for beginners and busy people!  Coach Nicole leads you through 7 strength training exercise routines and they are all 10 minutes or less.  Who doesn't have 10 minutes? (The other day, my family was going out and my husband was being slow to get ready. Instead of waiting impatiently, I just popped in the video, did a 10 minute workout, and by the time I was done, he was ready.) You can do one or more, up to you. Each one targets a different area, such as abs, arms, and lower body.

Summary: Buy this video now! You won't regret it!",1301011200,4,645,4.219512195121951
174938,5,1401927297,"This video is setup for ""10-mins a day"" individual workouts, but you can choose multiple workouts to play back to back or the same one multiple times for a longer workout. It's definitely geared toward beginners or those who just lack a lot of time or motivation to go all out. It's not for the die-hard fitness folks.

I use SparkPeople dot com and you can essentially get the same workouts for free on their website or on their youtube page. I recommend Spark for any ""beginner,"" though, and this DVD is no exception.",1300665600,3,519,4.5212765957446805

I was really huffing on the Call on your Core 10 minute segment and I could feel my sides and abs really working! If you do different day segments with her 10 minute Cardio Blast Video you can see your body transforming into muscle. I have been doing her videos for about 3 months now and will continue to use them to get better results. So far I have lost over 12 pounds and 10 inches all over.

174944,5,1401927297,"I loved this DVD because it's made of 10 minute workouts. The instructions are very clear; she gives plenty of alternatives for various levels; and is extremely encouraging.
The bonus cardio track is wonderful too, it was very tiring for me in the beginning.
A great way for beginners to get committed to workouts without being overwhelmed by the exercises or the time they require.",1285200000,11,382,4.892307692307693
174945,5,1401927297,Let me just start off by saying there's no way to not like Coach Nicole! She is very warm and personable! This is the perfect DVD for the busy Mom (like me!) that is almost always in a crunch for time. These workouts are just 10 minutes a day and THEY WORK! Come on.... Who can't find 10 minutes a day? And on the days you do have more time just double up and do the workout twice! It's a must have!!!,1284681600,7,401,3.902439024390244
174946,5,1401927297,Item was exactly what I was looking for. It leads you through a number of 10 minute exercises. The  10 minute workout for arms has been great for rebuilding strength and  flexibility on a damaged shoulder.,1283040000,4,205,4.666666666666667

It also has a bonus 15-minute cardio session if you want to add that to your strength session. I have the Jillian Michaels 30-Day Shred, but hardly ever use it because I prefer Nicole's low-key approach. I wanted to give this DVD as a gift, but couldn't find it on the Sparkpeople website. So, I crossed my fingers and checked with Amazon. Awesome! I HIGHLY recommend this DVD. It  is entirely user friendly. Nicole's approach is nonthreatening and reassuring.

I like that each work-out is 10 minutes. I have a lot of DVD's that I have quit using because sometimes after longer periods of time I am done working out, don't have the time or the trainer drives me nuts. You can follow the Day 1, Day 2 etc. schedule they give you or just pick what you want to work on that day. 98% of the time I end up doing 2 or more workouts in a day, as it is only 10 minutes each. If you are a beginner, you will not be disappointed with this. The work outs are not too intense so you will not get discouraged. They are intense enough that moderate fitness level people, like myself, get in a good work-out too. If I skip a couple weeks and then do a work-out, my muscles are very sore. I love the coach and the fact that she is real person. I really don't want a coach that has a 6 pack and barely sweats each movement. I am going to look for more SparkPeople workout products to add to my collection. I am 31, work full-time and have 3 kids and a husband, if I can fit this in you can too!

She is encouraging without being condescending.  The format allows you to customize your workout to meet your needs, fitness level and time requirements.  The 15 minute cardio segment is a great way to warm up for a session and Day 7 which combines yoga & Pilates moves is a good cool down.  I like to target 3 areas in a workout session and since the DVD always returns to the menu (rather than advancing to the next segment) I am able to select the sessions I want. The moves are challenging enough to give me a good workout.  This is probably the best DVD in my collectino.",1420848000,,713,4.574803149606299
