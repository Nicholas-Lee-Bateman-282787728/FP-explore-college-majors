8198638,5,B000R3447K,"I am a high school teacher of Spanish and have many students who talk about immigration very carelessly. I don't think you can have a discussion about immigration legal or illegal without understanding what people go through to get here.  Additionally teaching them that the debate is about policy and NOT about pointing fingers at people who risk their lives to come here. No matter what your political view is, the movie is a must. We can agree it is looking at the perspective of the travelers and if you call that liberal, oh well.

I don't think I changed all of my students opinions completely but we did make great strides to accept that the issue is much bigger than ""it's illegal and we need to deport them."" I think they also gained great insight into the challenge we face as people and a cycle of racism that exists here. If you are pointing fingers at immigrant workers and saying they are causing the downfall of a whole country then it IS RACISTS. Lots of right wing conservative talk show hosts like to say these people are using the ""race card"" and they are so ridiculous and ignorant.

I also recommend looking at Southern poverty laws lesson plans for teachers as they have some good readings.  If you have a conservative high school class, be careful to not be too liberal or they just write you off as a brain washer apparently.",1276905600,10,1349,4.539094650205762

It is powerful in its simplicity.  I've used this as a training tool with social workers, police officers, health care providers and others, and it always has been well received.",1194220800,15,391,4.82089552238806
