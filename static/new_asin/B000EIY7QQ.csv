8110519,3,B000EIY7QQ,"The film, ""Dead Friend,"" may appeal to some viewers, however, for those of you who like different and suspenseful films, you might find this film to be a disappointment. I found the film to be average at best, and below average in scare factor. This is not a great film, but it might appeal to some. The film centers on the life of a female college student named Ji-won Min (Ha-Neul Kim) who suffers from amnesia due to an accident. As she tries to put her life back in order, something ominous is occurring: Her former high school classmates are winding up dead---and all of their deaths are related to water. As she tries to remember her past, she has visions and dreams of a girl drowning, and what she thinks is a ghost following her.

Moreover, there is a connection to the deaths of her former classmates and the ghost. As the film progresses further along, the viewer will discover just what connection Ji-won and her former classmates have to this vengeful ghost. There are not very many surprising twists and turns in the film, and the ones that are present have been done to before numerous times, and much better. Plus, it you're like me and have seen a number of horror films, and Asian horror in particular, you will not be surprised. However, there are those who will find the film entertaining. As Ji-won turns to a male friend to find out what is happening, they both begin to investigate the ghost.

Also, the woman Ji-won must race against time to solve the mystery before she too becomes a victim of the ghost. This may sound a bit familiar [Ringu anyone?] However, the film does have its moments of creepiness. Not enough to sustain my interest. However, the ending is not too bad, an unexpected one at that. I highly recommend viewers to rent this film before purchasing it, because what may, or may not be suspenseful to me, may be to you. As horror is one of those genres where each of us will have our likes and dislikes to a particular film. Therefore, rent it first. I found the film to be just an average, to below average film. Recommended with caution. [Stars: 2.5]",1169856000,,2094,4.522427440633245
8110520,5,B000EIY7QQ,"Just like every other Korean horror movie I've seen, this movie combines creepy imagery, beautiful aesthetics, gripping suspense, and a mysterious plot that slowly unravels until everything makes sense.  If you like movies that combine horror with mystery, and do it wonderfully, then this is yet another great one from Korea.

I'd like to add one note.  I often hear people saying that a movie has ""ripped off"" The Ring if they see a ghost portrayed as a girl in a white dress with long dark hair covering her face.  Many Westerners think that The Ring created that image because they first saw it in that movie.  However, it is a traditional description of a ghost in East Asia, so it's to be expected that a ghost will take that form in an East Asian movie.",1154390400,7,760,4.5588235294117645
