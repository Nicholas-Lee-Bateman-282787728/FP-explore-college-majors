8431584,4,B000ZM1MNW,"I only resist the 5th star since none of these movies are digitally restored. Then again, if they were, you'd never find a bargain like this. If you are a fan of film noir and do not own Detour or D.O.A, you need this and it's a great start to a collection. The other volumes in this series are also very good, and when you get 9 or 10 movies for around $10 you really can not complain. Each set has at least two that are genuine classics of the genre, and for about $30-$40 you can have a whole collection.",1242864000,,507,4.02970297029703
