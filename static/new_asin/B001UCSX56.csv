8343269,4,B001UCSX56,"Interesting book, mostly common sense, with some sound suggestions for improving ourselves.  I keep it handy to remind myself of these suggestions.",1494115200,,147,5.681818181818182
8343270,5,B001UCSX56,"Great material, well presented. Material like this taken up by mass media would make dementia extinct.",1452038400,2,102,5.4375
8343271,5,B001UCSX56,I love watching any of the PBS programs with Dr. Amen. He presents his information in such a way that you can relate and understand how important it is to treat your mind with respect.,1374883200,8,184,4.285714285714286
8343272,3,B001UCSX56,"Some good info. Didn't feel I could watch with my little ones around with some of the language I personally didn't appreciate (many ""OM_"") and two of the stories he tells were not quite G rated either. I am thinking of trying some of his more recent stuff to see if it has less of what I don't appreciate.",1358208000,7,305,4.186440677966102
