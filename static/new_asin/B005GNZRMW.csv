4691995,5,B005GNZRMW,I found this movie REALLY REALLY good and funny at times. I hope they make more. Orlando Bloom playing the bad guy for once was a real nice extra.,1330128000,4,146,4.068965517241379
4691996,1,B005GNZRMW,"Air ships, and Matrix moves in this Victor Hugo's classic was dumb for a period piece. Fire the screen writer, and anyone who approved this crap. What a butcher job of a beloved classic!",1329696000,6,186,4.5
4691997,1,B005GNZRMW,"Let me just say that I did not enjoy the purchase of a movie ticket for The Three Musketeers. I found the Cinematography, lighting and acting to have major flaws from all incoming angles and was thoroughly disappointed. I was hoping for an action movie that wasn't cheesy. Quality is this movie's shortcoming and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE AT ALL!!! Chocolate bars are much more satisfying even though I would like one with vanilla and strawberry flavouring as well as chocolate.",1329436800,8,491,4.788235294117647
4691998,2,B005GNZRMW,"As a kid I loved the 3 Musketeers and the young witty teenager who became the fourth.  In this version there was good, bad and UGLY...

The good. Action, sword fights scenes, acting and logistics (the set, the colors, the cloths and scenery were first class.

The bad. The plot started-out well enough and then CGI computer effects, writing shortcuts and flying boats made a promising movie just plane lame and stupid. As a Syfy nut myself, I can leave reality at the door, but I cannot suspend it to a point of total stupidity, and you can not fix stupid.

The ugly. About 30 minutes before the movie ended, I could not help but think the writers wrote this movie into a corner. Instead of thinking a witty and/or plausible way to tie up all the loose ends they made, the writers figured the average person is a dolt (idiot) and if they threw a bunch of CGI and lame excuses and bizarre explanations that people would become confused and forget how bad and implausible the story became. What I am really disappointed in is with a movie with as many good to excellent actors, that none of them went, ""You got to be kidding me!"" and forced the writers into fixing this honorably story line. Well I guess I can now assume all parties involved in this flop were only too happy to cash their pay check versus delivering a real memorable and classic film.",1329350400,13,1350,4.4534412955465585
4691999,5,B005GNZRMW,"I loved this movie, mostly for the cinematography and costumes (silver-buckled shoes, capes, etc.), but also because it was very entertaining and lovable -- though i was rather disappointed with the two instances of foul language (the ""s"" word is said twice). But other than that, it is quite adorable and exciting.",1328832000,7,315,5.076923076923077
4692000,5,B005GNZRMW,"I must say that I loved this adaptation of the Three Musketeers, and I have seen most if not all of them.  Of course it was not true to the book, and we were sure of this going into the theater, as the preview and movie poster had air-ships on/in them.  I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It was hilarious, action packed, somewhat romantic and did I mention -  it was hilarious!

Bottom line: Is this a great period piece - no.  Is it an amazing piece of drama - no.  Is it completely true to Dumas' novel - no.  Will it win an Academy award - no.  What it was was sheer entertainment from begining to end.  I am pre-ordering it today, and highly recommend it to anyone!",1328400000,13,686,4.090225563909774
4692001,1,B005GNZRMW,"I realized going in that this would be very different from Alexander Dumas' masterpiece, but I just couldn't get past how terribly all the characters were portrayed.  None of the main characters are gentlemen, the king is weak and good for nothing, and Milady uses strength and martial arts, rather than seduction.  The motives for almost every character are also completely off.  The romance and honor are both absent in this film.  Normally I can tolerate movie adaptations of books that I enjoy, but this movie was just terrible.",1327881600,46,532,4.943820224719101
4692002,5,B005GNZRMW,"The story may be al ittle weak, but sometime you just need a great action movie with similiar styles to mission impossible.  I highly recommend this movie!  Stunts and action sequences are remarkable!",1327881600,29,200,5.03030303030303
4692003,3,B005GNZRMW,"If you're looking for your next movie to showcase for great 3D, The Three Musketeers delivers the same great 3D you've seen in Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, as Paul W.S. Anderson returns as director and has not lost his 3D touch (currently filming Resident Evil: Retribution 3D, which looks equally great from the 3D trailer as of Jan 2012). How good is the 3D here? Anderson learned his 3D from the Fusion 3D used on Avatar. Any more questions? Exceptional 3D in depth and the occasional pop outs.

Moving on to the movie itself, I went in with the expectations that the film would deliver interesting, like-able characters, a decent storyline and plenty of great action. They sort of got the last part right, but the rest is debatable IMO.

Characters: The lead hero is portrayed as an arrogant jerk, and the Three Musketeers are directionless, without a goal when the film gets underway. So who do I root for? Milla Jovovich of course. Too bad she didn't have a bigger role. Orlando Bloom appears, but does little more than talk for the few moments he appears.

Storyline: The story needs a strong goal right from the start. Without it, the film feels directionless and pointless. Just some clueless characters wandering about waiting for something to do, is how I perceived it. And I wanted to enjoy the film, but by the end, I didn't care how great the 3D was, I couldn't wait to leave the theater. But that's just one opinion. Another viewing might change the bad taste.

Action: Good action when it appears. The sword fights are good, but fencing is limited in the amount of jabs and strikes you can do. More creativity is welcome here. The other action scenes, ranging from Milla squeezing through some obstacle courses, to an in air battle of floating ships, are pretty well done and woke me up in the theater, but if you don't care about the characters, it's still hollow action.

Visuals: Great scenery and elaborate costumes if you like the style, top notch lighting and cinematography. Solid special effects.

If you like Pirate movies, then you may very well enjoy this. The setting is France, with all of the etiquette, pomp and circumstance, frilly wardrobes and prissy attitudes to go with it, notably displayed by the intentionally annoying King.
Decent at best.

Film: 5/10
Story: 4/10
Characters: 6/10
Action: 8/10
Visuals: 8/10
3D: 9/10 EXCELLENT.
Overall: 6/10 (not an average, saved by the 3D and action). If you need another 3D action movie for your 3DTV, the 3D will not disappoint. The movie on the other hand...",1327622400,90,2536,4.75
4692004,4,B005GNZRMW,"If you can imagine Resident Evil's Milla Jovovich in (and occasionally out of) hoop skirts, you're off to a great start. The Three (plus one) have been done so many times you might think it's played out. Hardly!  Starting with the classic political intrigue, this adds some Mission Impossible-style exploits, steam-punk aerials, all-out effects, and the doofiest British royal on record. And, for once, we get a modern action/adventure babe mixed in.

Hardly for Dumas purists, this popcorn-worthy flick dishes out what it promised: excitement, surprise, and utterly forgettable commodity entertainment.

Last time I watched it, I threw a tangerine at the tv.  So, in conclusion, this movie is awful and the cast is untalented. Well, by cast I mean Logan Lerman. He's a joke. Thank you for your time.

4692027,1,B005GNZRMW,"I started watching this on Amazon Prime and had to stop 30 minutes in.

It tried to capture the fantastic dialogue of the 1974 version and combine it with the high paced whimsy of the 1993 version, as well as bring in a steampunk component (for some random reason).

The main actor (whose apparent claim to fame is from the Percy Jackson films) falls completely flat on his lines and style for this film. The Musketeers are okay, but suffer from the poor adaptation of the books and dialogue to the new script.",1488758400,,510,4.473118279569892

4692032,3,B005GNZRMW,"There are definitely fun parts of this movie. The fight scenes are entertaining and the costumes are very fun. The acting is sometimes contrived but overall it hits on the satirical feeling well. While I respect each of the actors in this movie, the cast does not fit well. Corden is funny as usual but seems like a character from a different movie just plopped into this one. It felt like they were trying to achieve a tone similar to Stardust with fantastical historical fiction but it was a miss.",1485561600,,499,4.555555555555555
4692033,3,B005GNZRMW,"This is a simple review and a short one (No Spoilers!):
I came because I love the The Three Musketeers and most of the cast. It felt campy, but a good campy. If you are wanting a movie with video game like CGI with some good ridiculous fun, this movie is for you. If you have a rainy day with nothing to do and wanting to pass the time or are bored, this movie is for you. If you love any or some or all the cast, you'll hopefully enjoy seeing them in action. Overall, a fun entertaining movie!

I must warn you that this version of the Musketeer story bears the same relationship to the other Musketeer movies as the Wild Wild West bore to more traditional TV westerns.  I can't say a whole lot more without spoiling it for you.  I have a strong suspicion that Alex Litvak and Andrew Davies grew up watching Monty Python and reading Mad Magazine.,1481155200,,524,4.350515463917525

4692045,4,B005GNZRMW,"This is a Euro-made version, which deviates radically from both the novel and history in favor of action, adventure and martial arts.  It's good, of sort.  It owes a big hat-tip to ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" (and a host of other movie precursors).

Settings & scenery are quite nice.  Photography and CGI are good (within their budgets).

Dumas could likely have gotten along with this movie's characterization of the Musketeers (Porthos in particular is strikingly done), DArtagnan, Cardinal Richelieu & Rochefort.  He was gallant enough to have applauded Milla Jovovich as Milady (doing many of her own stunts, yet) but would have despaired over her wholesomeness and lack of subtlety.  He'd disown Buckingham & Louis XIII outright, and would be outraged at the characterization of Constance.

Dumas would, one suspects, be charmed by the idea of sky-ships - but maybe not so much, placed in this story.  He'd be livid that Milady never gets around to strangling Constance, and more so that Milady isn't beheaded on Athos' authority.  Lots of threads left dangling, here.

4692113,5,B005GNZRMW,"Okay, before I get into the review, I want to preface this by stating that tastes are subjective.  There are many people out there who think that the likes of Precious, Good Will Hunting, etc. are great films, while I on the other hand find them to be boring snoozefests.  When I see a movie I am looking to be entertained, not see a bunch of depressing drama slop that happens every day in real life.  On that note, this revision of The Three Musketeers definitely takes quite a few liberties with Alexandre Dumas' story, and it goes to extremes at times with trying to show the technology to be way ahead of the time period (ie the Will Smith version of the Wild, Wild West).  The actors do an okay job with the story and it can be entertaining and fun, but if you are going into this expecting an exceptionally well adapted version of the book then you will be disappointed.  For the best story adaptation to film I recommend the mid 70s Three Musketeers and Four Musketeers with Michael York and Co.  Where this adaptation really shines is in the fact that is visually and audibly stunning.  The 3D on this film is definitely impressive.  From the get go, it takes you on a Walk across the map of Europe with Army's represented by figurines as it explains the tensions and politics of the era.  The best way I can describe it is that it is probably the closest you would get to walking across a life size Risk Board complete with figurines.  The movie always has good depth but there are some visually striking scenes that really stand out (ie the front of a ship sticking straight out into your living room, or a Musketeer pointing his sword straight at the viewer and feeling that the tip of the blade is touching your forehead).  It should be noted that I was viewing this with an Epson HC2000 projector on a large blank living room wall and using Samsung 5100SSG 3D Glasses.  The whole movie is a plethora of eye candy and will not leave you wanting.  In the audio department, I can say that it is equally impressive.  If you have a decent 5.1 surround sound with a decent sized sub (ie 10 inch or 12 inch woofer) it will shake the house more often than not and do a great job of emulating canon fire, explosions, etc.  I have a Dayton Audio SUB-1200 ($138.50 shipped from Parts Express) and it shook the house so much during the film that I had to turn the sub and main volume down quite a bit as there were quite a few parts that about blew me off the couch.

So in conclusion the movie itself is a fun but silly adaptation of the book, but for audio and visual effects, you will be hard pressed to find it's equal for less than $8 shipped and is well worth it even if you strictly use it as a 3d reference quality disc.",1442534400,7,2730,4.292397660818714

4692137,1,B005GNZRMW,"Where to start? This is easily -- definitively --- the worst film I've ever seen. I would give it zero stars if I could. Negative stars. I've seen a lot of movies. I've seen a lot of bad movies. But not one comes close to this one. I've seen movies that I would consider poorly made, poorly-directed, poorly-cast, poorly written. But this movie has it all. It's so bad that I wouldn't endure it again if you offered to pay me. A million dollars. Every year until the end of time. You could literally offer to make me richer than God and I wouldn't watch this movie again.

With a promising cast of relatively well-known and respectable actors, it seems like a safe bet from the previews. No. Guess again. Never have I been so enraged by a film -- and to call this SPECTACLE a film is *generous* -- that I have screamed obscenities (and later, howled exasperatedly) at the screen. If it demonstrated even the slightest hint of being self-aware, it might -- MIGHT -- be acceptable as a comedy. But it's not. It takes itself seriously. Which is actually more impressive as an act of delusion than anything else. Like who wrote this? Who penned this script and felt that it was acceptable in any way, shape or form?  It was around the point that one of the Musketeers gave a horse a parking ticket in Renaissance France that I lost it. I don't think you understand. HE GAVE. A HORSE. A PARKING TICKET. YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS. WHAT KIND OF DISEASED MIND COMES UP WITH THIS?

After watching for only ten minutes, you want to throw the nearest object through the screen. After twenty minutes, you start to wonder if it's an elaborate practical joke organized by Christoph Waltz. After thirty minutes, you consider ritual suicide to purge this movie of its sins and to leave the cruel and inhumane world that would produce this kind of cinema. Logan Lerman is the most atrocious actor I've had the distinct displeasure to watch fumble through the ""swaggering young rogue"" trope, which is cringe-inducing at best and vomit-inducing at worst. One wonders how he managed to make a career of acting. One wonders how the editors managed to sit through post-production without hurling themselves out of the nearest plate-glass window and hoping for the best.

I'm not done. Sit down. This movie has like fourteen villains. Too many villains. The Musketeers have more enemies than, well... anyone. The Church wants to kill them. Orlando Bloom wants to kill them. Milady wants to kill them. Mads Mikkelsen wants to kill them. You want to kill them. Their own country thinks they're loose cannons who don't play by the rules. And to be honest they're right. The Three Musketeers are domestic terrorists. They slaughter and maim LITERALLY DOZENS of marshals in the streets of Paris without any repercussions. Instead of their escaping punishment being endearing, it's just baffling. The King is more concerned about his wardrobe than running his country. AND IT'S STILL AWFUL.

The thing is, this movie doesn't play by the rules. Any rules. You expect literally anything to happen in it, because it shocks and appalls at every turn. Like if space aliens came down and the scenery started melting to the soundtrack of ABBA's Dancing Queen, you might be like, ""Oh, it's a surrealist film. I get it now."" But it holds on to this pretense of being ""clock-punk"" or a ""re-imagining"" of the time. Like come on. I'm not five. And this still doesn't make any freakin sense.

Just when you think it's finally over, you think you've survived, you realize that the ending is setting itself up for sequel. The gall.",1435363200,10,3583,4.706539074960127

I gave this 2 stars:  1 for casting and 1 for Special effects.

I also TOOK AWAY stars for casting.  How is this possible you ask?  Simple.  You take the 3 musketeers, Orlando Bloom, and Mila. So far so good.  5 stars right there.  Subtract D'artagnon, his love interest (who is so totally and completely unremarkable and possibly one of the worst actresses I have seen for a long time),  and the king and queen whos acting skills come to mediocre at best.

My feelings for this movie was like it was lukewarm.  Some hot water in there, mixed with some very cold water and you get...  tepid.

Not Good, Not terrible, just ......  unremarkable and completely forgettable.

To see a rendition of one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time fail so miserably...  Sad days.",1426464000,,805,4.602836879432624

I'm amazed by the sheer awfulness of the script, acting, directing, editing and action sequences. Dumas is rolling in his grave with laughter or agonizing pain that there was yet another miserable attempt to remake a great story.

To be fair the acting was done okay. The action choreography was sup par but the editing of this movie made it equally worse. Trying to put Matrix style action into a sword dueling movie does not flow well even if they were wanting to go well over the top on the action. Lastly but importantly the script to movie left much room to be desired. The situations were predictable and story isn't trying anything new if it wanted to appeal to a younger hip audience. Thank goodness people in that bracket are smart enough to know crap from quality.

4692204,3,B005GNZRMW,"This movie constitutes the most effective use of 3D effects to have ever graced the Silver Screen within close temporal proximity to Avatar, featuring some of the most majestic architecture, the most elaborate stage sets, the most intricate and impressive costume design, commendable integration of sound effects, great stunt choreography, and great eye candy by way of the stunning, Milla Jovovich, who is featured in this movie showcasing her gorgeous legs, and the ever alluring new comer - British actress, Gabriella Wilde, who will literally take your breath away in what constitutes a modern take of the classic French tale of the three musketeers.

The story revolves around Miladys plot with the King of England, in collusion with the French Arch Bishop, to plunge the two countries into war in order to depose the infantile French King so that the Arch Bishop will be able to seize the reins of power by stealing the French Queens jewel necklace and creating suspicion in the French King that his Queen was having an affair with the King of England by implanting a love letter alluding to the Queen having offered the necklace (which was given to her by the French King) to the King of England, and the Arch Bishop suggesting to the French King that he put the Queen to the test by asking her to wear the necklace to a ball, with the three musketeers and the son of a former musketeer saving the day by retrieving the neck and returning it to the Queen, thereby, allaying the Kings fear that his Queen was unfaithful, thus, avoiding a war.

4692222,3,B005GNZRMW,"I didn't expect much from this film, to be honest.  My Three Musketeers was the 70s era Richard Lester films, against which no other filmed version has ever held up for me.  However, with a cast that included Ray Stevenson, Matthew MacFayden, Luke Evans, Christophe Waltz, and Orlando Bloom, I figured that even if the writing was poor, it would at least be interesting to watch.

Unfortunately, the script made so little use of Stevenson, MacFayden, and Evans -- who played Porthos, Athos, and Aramis respectively -- that it was hard to recall that this was supposed to be their story.  What little they got to do, they did well, as I would have expected.  Waltz and Bloom pretty much did all the heavy lifting in the film, and they were delightful.  Bloom has a knack for comedy that he rarely gets to exercise, so it was nice to see it put to use here.  The rest of the cast was dismal.

I'm guessing a lot of money went into the look of this film.  The costumes were gorgeous, and so over the top that they were almost like characters in their own right.  It's sad to note that some of the hats did better jobs than the actors wearing them.  And as for the steampunk elements, and martial arts nonsense... honestly, by the end of the film, they bothered me less than the crappy script and silly performances.

So all things considered, I enjoyed some elements of this film, while others were eye-rollingly disappointing.  I'd say that if you go into it expecting to be mildly amused but nothing more, you'll be fine.  You might actually not consider it two hours of your life you'll never get back again.",1409270400,,1608,4.5

4692240,2,B005GNZRMW,"Oh my word, this was a bad movie. You can tell from the first 2 minutes that it will be unpleasant to watch.

Unfortunately, I kept on watching hoping for it to get better. The truth is, it does get slightly better, but not by much.

It's really sad this kind of movie is not made to leave a legacy as well as make a profit, it clearly was made just to make money. That's business I guess, but I can't imagine anyone having interest in reading the novel after watching this adaptation.

So what's wrong with it?
-It's so bad it almost feels like satire, but it's not intended to be! At least I don't think so.
-Casting - I love mostly unknown actors, but pick some that fit the roles! d'Artagnan is a horrible child in this version. And the Cardinal? Oh my, he's about as evil as a bunny rabbit. The only person that can act is the Queen and she gets about 2 minutes to do it!
-Plot - Holes left and right. And are we supposed to believe that there is actually chemistry between d'Artagnan and Constance? It's painful to watch their forced interactions.
-TONS of overdone CGI - And I mean nearly EVERYTHING. It ruins the entire experience. A distant cutaway is one thing, but it's nearly everything, including anytime there are more than 10 soldiers on screen.
-Absurdly over the top with little grasp on reality - Everything from flying boats to invincible characters.

What's good about it?
-The costumes are very well done. This is where it gets confusing. Why do such a good job on those (even if they are not historically accurate), yet bomb the rest of the movie?
-There are some beautiful interiors of buildings.
-Like mentioned before, the actor who plays the Queen does a good job.

Overall it just doesn't have any magic and doesn't feel special in any way. If you're going to do a bad movie, that's fine, but don't ruin such a great story. Poor Alexandre Dumas must be rolling in his grave.  I know movies are incredibly complex to make, but I can't possibly imagine any director with any sense of pride or quality would release this to the public.

It has the character names, places, and somewhat of the same time period, but that's pretty much it. So, if you are looking for authenticity, look elsewhere.

The movie is oddly cast. I watched this purely to see Ray Stevenson, I also like Matthew Mcfayden, but they are both really not great musketeers at all. It's as if someone said, ""Those guys are great actors! Let's get them for our next film"" without considering what the film was. This is a bit of an antiquey comic book action movie. They really don't fit that mold.

The writing is forgettable. The dialog is cliche. Very unoriginal.

The settings and costumes could have been really intriguing, but they are juxtaposed with airships, a naked woman on a rooftop, intricate electronic security systems, sparkling clean cities and people, a main character who looks like he belongs in an 80s rock band, and other things that just aren't period, it makes for an odd and unsettling mix.  It just doesn't make sense. That is the bottom line of why this movie doesn't work. It just doesn't make sense.

Reading all this you might wonder why I gave it 3 stars and not lower. Call me a sucker for Ray Stevenson. I can't explain it otherwise. :)",1391990400,,1318,4.737991266375546

Mostly you get to witness the actors having the time of their lives as all good productions of the story have afforded us in the past all the way back to Gene Kelly and Lana Turner et al.  Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovitch are the biggest names aboard stateside and both are no strangers to the action film genre.  The old tale has been told in every possible fashion in its many many film incarnations and so Paul W. S. Anderson (known mostly for the Resident Evil franchise) takes it in the pure action and fun direction of the modern cine-plex blockbuster and obviously has a heck of a time doing it.  For a period piece it's fun to see the formula applied to the ultimate buddy pic.  I found the 3D really added to the overall enjoyment of this particular movie when it does not to many others released these days.  Milla Jovovitch is a joy to behold and Orlando acquits himself very well but neither over shadows their fellow actors in this brisk and bawdy boisterous adaptation.  I had fun at the movies again and these days that's as rare as a good story.  The picture and sound are equal to the task on both the Blu-Ray and The Blu-Ray 3D.  In short, if you are a fan of Dumas' novel as I am and have seen all the productions done then this particularly frantic version is a worthy addition to your collection.",1386374400,2,1368,4.354330708661418

4692271,3,B005GNZRMW,"When this movie first came out in theaters I wanted to see it because of the trailers which showed Mill Jovovich sword fighting; however, it did not get great ratings and I decided to wait until the film was out on DVD.  I purchased this film for a bargain price and I viewed it last night.  Though it had its moments, with some great but too short sword scenes, I was a little disappointed.

You would think that with stars such as Milla Jovovich (Who I love in the Resident Evil series etc.), Orlando Blood, Logan Lerman and Christophe Walz the movie should have been great.  It shows the importance of having good screen writers and a more compelling story line is to making a movie a success.

One of the ways I use to judge a movie and decide whether it is a great, good, fair or bad movie is as follows:  A great movie is the kind I know I will view over and over again and still enjoy it.  A good movie I usually want to see at least twice.  A fair movie is one in which one  time viewing is enough.  A  bad movie rating is one that is  a total waste of  time viewing.

In conclusion, this is an okay movie but not in anyway memorable.

4692276,2,B005GNZRMW,"What an utter waste of talent. Truly, what a waste of a classic novel. It's too awful to even contemplate in depth, but it's pretty much a travesty. Despite the extremely talented cast, millions spent on special effects, a musical score clearly borrowed from Sherlock Holmes, beautiful costumes , and a well-known director, this version of The Three Musketeers is an epic failure. Logan Lerman is way too young to play D'Artagnan. He looks young, and he acts young. His ""romance"" with Constance is a joke; they are mistmatched beyond anything I've seen recently. Matthew Macfadyen plays Athos admirably, but his constant brooding nature gets tedious after a while, and he has very little else to do. Luke Evans is Aramis, and it would have been an excellent casting choice-if he stayed true to his novel character. Here, I have no idea whatsoever who he is supposed to be. Is he a priest? Does religion matter to him? Ray Stevenson is Porthos and I can't find any fault with his character. He is Porthos to me. Then there's Milla Jovovich as Milady. Cunning, beautiful, dangerous, and apparently a martial arts expert. Her role is so eye-roll inducing, I nearly stopped watching the movie because of her. Mads Mikkelsen as Rochefort is really good, but a bit cartoony. My big gripe is with Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu. This is a man who is supposed to inspire fear, a manipulative, evil sort of character who here is so utterly confusing and at times even a comic relief. Mind boggling. King Louis is useless here, acting like a spoilt, whiny child who is more concerned about the latest fashion than his own country's affairs. Orlando Bloom is the only one apparently having any fun here as the wicked Duke of Buckingham, but again it leads nowhere.

This film is so disjointed and ridiculous I can't even be sure if we, the audience are supposed to take it seriously or what. The steampunk genre gets thrown at us at random and before you know it, you've forgotten what the actual plot of the film is. Oh yes, the perilous affair of the Queen's diamonds that the musketeers have to recover in London within a 5 day time period. Wow, I'm susprised the director even remembered to keep SOMETHING from the novel intact. I could nitpick this thing to death but it's not even worth the effort. I was so dissapointed as I was really looking forward to a newly updated, true adaptation. I guess I'll keep waiting.",1380585600,,2418,4.702830188679245

4692281,2,B005GNZRMW,"Before watching The Three Musketeers, I asked myself how it could be rated so bad. Sure, critics are never partial to these sorts of movies, but I had hopes that it would be an action-packed, fun, crowd-pleasing adventure with some good acting. After all the cast was amazing. Excluding Logan Lerman, who has all the skill and acting range of a small pebble, the cast had the excellent Matthew Macfayden, the icy-cool Luke Evans, the electrifying Mads Mikkelsen (coolest European actor ever!), the peerless Christoph Waltz, and the flamboyant Orlando Bloom. You couldn't go wrong with that A-list. Or so I told myself, because, evidently, you COULD.

So I give you My Reasons Why The Three Musketeers (2011) Sucks:

1. The Cast: What -- it's greatest advantage is also it's greatest downfall? Pretty much. Let's start with Logan Lerman, in the most miscast role of all time since Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. Lerman can't act. Sometimes he chooses roles that fit him better (Percy Jackson), but his roles so far are mediocre at best, and this is a phenomenally bad role (I have hope for him, though, in the future). Nobody attempts even the faintest shadow of an accent, French or British, speaking instead in whatever accent they deem easiest. Matthew Macfayden is a phenomenal actor, but he comes off here as just silly, and Ray Stevenson is turned into a stupidly strong fighting machine. Luke Evans is the ONE good thing about this movie, I swear, as he manages to keep his dignity about him AND be cool at the same time. Bloom and Waltz chew up the scenery with their OTT roles, but neither actor is showing off their true range. Mikkelsen is usually the coolest actor onscreen, but is reduced here to a mere caricature. Milla Jovovich becomes a juvenile sex symbol, and Juno Temple is miscast. I could go on and on...

2. The screenplay is ABSOLUTELY atrocious: The dialogue is abysmally bad, filled with uber cheesy oneliners and modern slang that sounds absolutely foreign in the mouths of such fine actors (you actually begin to feel sorry for Macfayden). You can have Daniel Day-Lewis and Bobby de Niro in your movies, but if you give them bad lines....they will still sound bad.

3. The CGI: this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen in a mainstream blockbuster. It is painfully obvious and terribly out of place. Be prepared to grimace, groan, and be shocked at just...really poor computer generated imagery. The slo-mo, the airships, the cityscapes...it's all really bad.

4. All that steampunk nonsense. Airships, wires that act like lasers, hidden crypts, modern technology, and all that stupid stuff about Da Vinci designing all these fantastical machines....oh, and one more: AIRSHIPS. In the early 1800's. Because that's so stupid we need to say it again.

5. Distance yourself in EVERY way possible from the original book. Take the most beloved work of French literature ever (aside from Les Miserables), with peerless action, humour, and characters. Then tear that down piece by piece, substitute with your own terrible plot, and garnish with slapstick. Enjoy.

6. Shoot for mediocrity. To this day, there has still never been a film adaptation of Dumas's Three Musketeers that has fully satisified me. The finest one to date is the Michael York 1973 version, starring Oliver Reed, Charlton Heston, Faye Dunaway, and Michael York as D'Artagnan. The 1993 version with Chris O'Donnel, Kiefer Sutherland, and Tim Curry is silly but loads of guilty fun. The Three Musketeers (2011) has no wish to set itself above or apart any from the previous film versions. That's why it sucks.

PROS: Luke Evans?...uhh, costumes?....uhh...

What more can I say? This is a pretty bad movie, not even worth watching to entertain you for 1 and a half hours. Watch one of the older versions, read the awesome book, but stay away, because this is not worth watching. 2 rapiers out of 5.",1378339200,3,3895,4.871601208459214

4692322,1,B005GNZRMW,"I saw this movie in the theaters on my 21st birthday. For anyone who has seen it, you understand, surely, that that is a tragedy.

I don't even know where to begin. The film certainly seemed promising enough. Glitzy steampunk reimaginings - pleasing to the eye. An all-star cast including Matthew McFayden, Christoph Waltz, and Orlando Bloom. A very intriguing trailer.

And then they all opened their mouths.

The screenplay is a load of tripe, a real piss-poor conglomeration of modern slang and ""hilarious"" quips that make me wonder if Alex Litvak and Andrew Davies know what the words ""hilarious"" or ""quip"" mean. I swear to God, when the word ""retro"" came out of Orlando Bloom's mouth, I wanted to poke him in the eye and everyone in the theater who laughed when he said it.

As for the rest, I can't EVEN. I'm not trying to *spoil* anything (good God, as if I could spoil a movie this rancid), but not only are we expected to believe that the musketeers are no longer swordsmen, but reincarnated as ninja war machines, the characters are stripped of nearly everything that made them loveable and worth remembering in the first place. They are now flat, dull semblances of their former selves designed merely to look good while prancing around Anderson's admittedly amazing sets and landscapes, spouting crap lines to get cheap laughs. I swear, they only let Aramis remain a priest as a way to somehow set him apart and make him cool, untouchable.

Milla Jovovich was just Resident Evil's Alice all dolled up. Christoph Waltz... I don't even know what he was doing in this movie. I like to think he was tricked or it was way awesomer at the start and some crazy contract made him stay through the finish. His character, Cardinal Richelieu, was watered down to the point of meaninglessness. In the end, when his mindnumbingly dull plot to take over the crown was discovered (and thus my pain at having watched such a movie near its end), he does nothing. He's just like, ""Oh man, I really wanted to be secret King of France, but now that you musketeers have stopped me. Oh well. Maybe next time, guys."" And the musketeers look at him and... let him go. BEGIN SCREAMING AT POINTLESSNESS OF ENTIRE MOVIE. Also, apparently people don't die when they fall from airships. Didn't know that. Must log it away for future reference.

Another barf inducement: the old boy humor. Ugh, just so nauseating. Yes, make your manservant sleep on the porch so birds poop on him. So hilarious! Make jokes about how hot you are when you, let's be honest, have a dressed-up mullet. So attractive! Put down women, the entire sex of which was only included to be delicious, necklace-stealing, lady-in-waiting eye candy for the bros. Yay!

This is where I get even snootier because the worst part of this is that everyone who heard me say that I did not enjoy this film, not at ALL, said (and please say this in your head in a voice as whiny as possible - I sure am), ""It's Paul W. S. Anderson. What did you expect?""

Hmm... what did I expect? FOR IT TO SUCK A WHOLE LOT LESS.

***I have heard a lot of people blame the existence of this movie on Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. I will say that I love that movie. I will also say that it is a pretty dumb interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. It is a glammed up, tricked out caricature of a much loved character, turning him from a crime-fighting genius into a gutzy, attractive, P.I. ninja/professional wrestler/vessel of all human knowledge. The reason Guy Ritchie got away with it was that it was done WELL. The design is beautiful (also very steampunk), the music is INCREDIBLE, and the dialogue is effing brilliant. It's not hard to forgive the obvious differences when comparing the books to the film because enough of the old Sherlock is preserved. The viewer can be convinced this is a new Sherlock, like the old but reimagined to be as smart, sexy, and funny as they want. And that is the big, fat, freaking difference. /endsong",1360108800,2,3962,4.624466571834993
4692323,5,B005GNZRMW,"The story in this movie was inspired by Dumas' The Three Musketeers.  I say inspired because the story has been changed.  Dumas' characters are there, the period is right, but this is not the same story that Alexandre Dumas wrote.  Don't let that turn you off.  This is a fun movie to watch.  Quite frankly, the original story needed to be modified for the modern audience anyway.

The story begins in Venice where we find our Musketeers on a mission to steal Leonardo DaVinci's engineering plans for a flying ship.  Unfortunately, they are not the only ones who are interested in the plans.  The English are also interested in building a fleet of flying ships in order to have the capability to invade their rival nations.  The trio successfully disable the guards and evade the security traps to the vault.  Now in possession of the document, the group then decides to make their escape.  A short time later, Milady DeWinter betrays them and steals the document, delivering it to their English rival, the Duke of Buckingham.

Fast forward six months.  Relationship between France and England have deteriorated.  To take advantage of this, Cardinal Richeleu wants to trigger a war between the two nations, hoping to take the throne from the king during the resulting chaos.  DeWinter, who works as a double-agent, steals the Queen's prized necklace and plants false evidence pointing to a romantic relationship between the Queen and Buckingham.  The Cardinal, hoping this would force France's young King Louis XIII into declaring a war with England, manipulates the monarch into testing the Queen's fidelity.  The necklace, a gift from the king, was taken to England by DeWinter.  Richeleu manipulates the king into thinking that the Queen had given the necklace to Buckingham, as a sign of affection.  To test the Queen, King Louis decides to hold a ball.  He then specifically instructs the Queen to wear the necklace to the dance.  Constance, the beautiful lady-in-waiting to the Queen, makes a desperate plea to the young D'Artagnan to recover the necklace in time for the ball.  D'Artagnan and the three musketeers agree to sneak their way into England and steal the necklace from the tower of London.  The date of the ball is only five days away.

The Musketeers, now four in number, retrieve the necklace and steals one of Buckingham's flying ships along the way.  The Cardinal, not one to be easily discouraged, sends his henchman, Rochefort, to intercept the musketeers on their way back to France.  With an improved flying boat of his own, Rochefort confronts the musketeers and forces young D'Artagnan to give up the necklace.

Logan Lerman heads the all-star cast, playing D'Artagnan.  Milla Jovovich, Mads Mikkelsen, Matthew MacFadyen, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Ray Stevenson, Juno Temple, Freddie Fox, Christoph Waltz, and the very beautiful Gabriella Wilde round out the supporting roles.  I would have to say that all were great in their respective parts.  Particularly Orlando Bloom as the very arrogant Duke of Buckingham.  Gabriella Wilde is just breathtakingly beautiful as Constance, the love interest of D'Artagnan.  Paul W.S. Anderson, Milla's husband, directed the movie.

This is a fun movie to watch, blending flashy action and light comedy into a very watchable story.  The terrific cast is what made the movie work.  There are a lot of elements here that have been changed from the original story.  And this is unlike any of the other previous movies made from the source material.  Let's just say this movie was inspired by the original material from Dumas, but has a story all its own.  In other words, the original story has been given the Paul W.S. Anderson treatment.  I highly recommend this movie.",1359417600,3,3734,5.0

I enjoyed it. There's a lot of action, some laughs, and a couple of eye roll moments - one of the women does a couple of dodging fight moves worthy of The Matrix.
I've never read the book, so I can't comment on how well it follows that, but the four musketeers are all arrogant, but fun to watch - and you really end up rooting for them!

4692333,3,B005GNZRMW,"If you're a big fan of Barry Sonnenfeld's 1999 steam-punk remake of Wild Wild West, then you'll probably love this interpretation of The Three Musketeers.

The story casts Logan Lerman as D'Artagnon, Mathew MacFayden as Athos, Luke Evans as Arimis, and Ray Stevenson as Titus Pullo, a Roman Legionaire who's skill with a sword is matched only by his love of wine and women. Actually, Stevenson plays Porthos, the musketeer who's skill with a sword is matched only by his love of wine and women. The story begins in the early 17th century when French black ops  team consisting of Athos, Porthos, and Arimis break into a super-secret underground vault in Venice to steal Leonardo Davinci's secret plans for giant for schooner shaped dirigibles. The manage to steal the plans only to have Athos girlfriend Milady (played by Milla Jovavich) betray them to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). From there we go to rural France where D'Artagnon, the son of an impoverished former musketeer leaves home to seek fortune and adventure as a swordsman.

From that point on it's all fights and chases. It's just like every other Three Musketeer movie except a lot of the action centers on high speed chases and aerial cannon battles between wooden blimp. Also, many of the musketeers have very modern super-abilities.  Portho has the super strength to rip chains out of the wall. Another Musketeer has a steam-punk frogman suit. Another dives off rooftops like Batman. Miady is a super cat burglar with grappling lines hidden in her clothing.

The Three Musketeers is basically silly fun. 9 year old boys will love it for the swordfights, blimp chases and explosions. 13 year old boys will like it even more for the exposed cleavage.",1356566400,,1725,4.914089347079038

The story follows the adventures of D'Artagnan and the 3 musketeers set in France in the early 1600s during a time of power struggles and intrigue between the king and church.

This movie is a loose remake of the original taking general themes and protagonists but developing new specific plot elements. The general tone is comedic bumbling by our heros keeping them safe but it just doesn't feel right for the seriousness of the stakes (death). The young, hip actors are trying to make a modern, fast-moving drama that retains one's attention but they lose the sense of intrigue, suspense, and gravity that marked the novel.

I was terribly mistaken. And I thought the '93 version with Charlie Sheen was bad! Little did I know.

With this you get a lot of bad acting, corny special effects and pathetic dialogue. The only thing good about this movie is the setting and costumes which are breathtakingly beautiful. Other than that...this movie is a dog. Oh wait, excuse me I'm wrong. Actually this movie is more like what the dog leaves behind on the carpet.

It's 2012 and Hollywood has access to super technology that could've really made this film a masterpiece for the new generation. Instead we get an MTV version of The Three Musketeers and Orlando Bloom with a pompadour.

4692346,1,B005GNZRMW,"A previous reviewer was absolutely right to ask if there was a rating lower than 1 star. This is unfortunately another example of a mostly excellent group of actors given really clunky dialogue and inserted into a silly film. Its amazing to remember that the fun story of the Three Musketeers was already written. Its not like they came up with a goofy story and made a bad movie out of it. They just took an exciting story and made a stupid movie out it. I've seen all the actors in this movie before and have enjoyed their work, but they just had nothing to work with here. The only one who I thought did sort of a bad acting job was Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan. I didn't believe him in that part for a second.

On the plus side, this is one gorgeous-looking movie. You could pause it at pretty much any point and be looking at a work of art on screen. Great costumes, fantastic sets and scenery, and pretty-nice CG.

So, to wrap up: Beautiful-looking movie, good cast, terrible dialogue, silly story, bad to terrible acting, horrible direction. I just bought this at a good price from Amazon and it is the first one ever that I will be immediately selling. I was extremely disappointed with this film and feel sort of bad for the actors involved in it. I usually defend Paul W.S.

I sat through the whole thing with my 10 year old. Even she said - ""Daddy, what in the world was this about?"".
This disgrace of a flick is an insult to the action genre. The acting was some of the worst, I've ever seen. Logan Lerman has reprised his role as Percy Jackson, with about the same results. Perhaps he should take up knitting as a main source of income, because he sure sucks as an actor. Orlando Bloom has always been a Pretty Boy on the screen. I guess, if you can't act, you should at least have the looks, but even that is slipping. The rest of the cast didn't fare any better.
Cinematography is hysterically funny. It's like watching Pirates of the Caribbean 3 through the eyes of Jar Jar Binks.

Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way, and even with top actors like Christoph Waltz, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Orlando Bloom, and Milla Jovovich involved, `The Three Musketeers' is a really flat and forgettable affair, the kind of movie where you just can't seem to find anything to hold onto.

The actors did their best, but the characters were just too cardboard to feel anything for, the humor was more miss than hit, and even then it was only chuckle funny than laugh out loud, and the action was too superficial and done-before to be engaging - I commented in an early scene that `Milla was going Resident Evil' and wasn't surprised to find Resident Evil series director Paul W.S. Anderson is at the helm - and the whole film just felt like it was chugging slowly along.

It's a case of a lot of gloss and little substance, but a film is trouble when it struggles to even make the gloss work.

Not only was it extremely clean (besides a few hilariously placed cuss words and chest-showing damsels in distress), but it was just freaking phenomenally incredible. Do I make sense here? Is my brain befuddled and therefore befuddling you? I'm befuddled. This movie befuddles me. Hopefully you can make sense of this... ;)

So what was there in this movie to look forward to, to love?

First off, great music. If you listen to the soundtrack, you'll understand. Paul Haslinger - look him up.

The modern vibe. I wasn't sure if I was going to like that part of it, but I did. Man, oh man.

Then there was the cast. Ohhhhhh!! Whoever did the casting is a genius. These actors/actresses were perfect for their roles. I don't remember if there was once a line uttered wrong for the scene. Nothing about the actors and their talents was cheesy. Even actors (coughOrlandoBloomcough) who I've never appreciated the acting of were perfect for their parts and said everything perfectly and did everything perfectly. Was it the director or something? Dang, these guys nailed it.

The filming was beautiful, as was the editing and CG. Oh man I want to live some of those scenes just because of the color and the way everything was so lifelike...and yet not.

Then there were the costumes. HOLY SMOKES I wanted to wear every single dress in this movie; heck, I would have even tried on a man's outfit just for the sake of it. They were all extremely colorful and grand and beautifully detailed.

They did all their own stunts. I mean, come on! Does it get better? Yes. Yes it does.

Then, there was the dueling, the sword fights. It was like...art. Seriously, every move was like a hand-crafted porcelain from a master, perfectly placed and excellently choreographed, like a dance, or a poem.

And the story line/characters. What the heck! It was fantastical. The story line was nonstop action and adventure. Every plot and subplot was carefully placed, every line written for a purpose and for the immense enjoyment of the movie-goer. I couldn't believe my eyes - everything was so intense, all the colors, all the action. Toward the end, I thought I was in the climax, but no, I wasn't. Things kept going wrong - and getting worse. I thought I was seeing the end, but then some other problem arose and was bigger than the last. The final blowout scene was satisfying and amazing. The best scene. WOW.

And....I've been saving the best for last. Drum-roll please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

LOGAN LERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ok, so I've had a thing for this guy since I saw ""3:10 to Yuma"", where he played with my all time favorite (Christian Bale) and nailed his role. In ""Percy Jackson"", he was the best thing about that movie (which sucked). And now, here, in this movie, he not only has a leading role, he has, what appeared to me, *the* leading role.

Let me give you an example of how good Logan did at taking on his role. You know those characters, those who are new at whatever their task is, those who are very innocent an nave and who do extremely embarrassing things that make the reader/watcher cringe in horror for him/her? Well, D'Artagnon could have been one of those characters. He did do some things that showed his naivety, but I never once cringed in painful embarrassment. I laughed. Heartily. Because the things he did were funny, and lessons learned. And even if the girl didn't fall for his flirty charms, I DID. Like, from the moment he opened his mouth. From the moment he whipped out that beautiful sword and fought off like twenty men before he received help.

How did he do it? I ask myself. He perfected his role, made for laughter and entertainment, as well as a character who you could respect even while he is learning. That is what I call fantabulous acting. I hope he becomes one of the greats. :D

And those are the reasons why this movie gets a 10/10 from me!! :D (And why you should somehow go see this movie right now!!!)",1347840000,8,4346,4.595607235142118

4692361,3,B005GNZRMW,"Six feet under and rotted in the soil, Alexandre Dumas is rolling over furiously. Heck, even the makers of the much reviled THE MUSKETEER are turning over in their graves (never mind that they're probably not even dead yet). THE MUSKETEER was deplored for its shabby updating and lame use of anachronisms and its swapping of classic swordplay for a more Eastern fighting approach. This latest incarnation of Dumas' classic literature comes along and lifts that same ill-advised blueprint but adds a more pronounced Michael Bey sensibility. 2011's THE THREE MUSKETEERS is louder and bigger-budgeted and peppered with even more anachronistic touches, such as that scene in which Aramis meets D'Artagnan for the first time and he issues him a traffic citation. It's a jarring departure, if you're a stickler for faithful adaptations. Me, it depends. I enjoyed Johnny Weismuller's Tarzan films even though his interpretation of Tarzan was a far cry from E.R. Burroughs' vision. But I can't make up my mind whether to rate THE THREE MUSKETEERS 2.5 out of 5 stars, or 3.5. I had fun watching this, but there were things that seriously bugged me.

The world ushers in the dawn of the 17th Century, a tumultuous time. After the assassination of his father, young King Louis XIII ascends the throne. But his inexperience and feckless nature allow his chief advisor, the manipulative Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), to expand his power base on the sly.

You may spot traces of Dumas' original narrative, but it's been garishly gussied up and liberties have been taken. Young and brash D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) of Gascony rides to Paris to make his fortune, harboring dreams of becoming a Musketeer. But no sooner does he set foot in Paris than he offends in quick succession three disapproving citizens and makes an appointment with each to settle accounts by way of duel. These three, of course, are Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, the three most notorious in the ranks of the Musketeers. When the sneery Cardinal's guards interfere, D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers quickly join forces and by so doing spark lifelong friendships.

But D'Artagnan is still far from realizing his goal. The Musketeers, under Richelieu's calculated ministrations, have fallen on hard times, are rendered obsolete, are reduced to swilling cheap wine and quarreling with the Cardinal's guards. Seeking a righteous cause around which to rally, D'Artagnan and his new friends unearth a dangerous conspiracy spearheaded by Richelieu and the treacherous Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich). This bit of plot territory is familiar enough: the Musketeers must retrieve compromising jewelry and so defend the Queen's honor and prevent a war. Only, in the book, I don't remember a storming of the Tower of London or huge, battling airships or flamethrowers. Or Milady de Winter taking such a physically active role and indulging in bullet time sequences. In that sense, the role perfectly suits Milla Jovovich.

So, listen, if you can find it in you to put aside director Paul W.S. Anderson's bastardization of the source material... and I know that's a hard if... then you just may have fun with this latest iteration. We get a hint that this would be a departure when the film opens up with the Three Musketeers conducting a black ops in Venice. Anderson (elsewhere known as Mr. Jovovich) has a knack for staging stunning visual panoramas, even if sometimes plot and narrative are suspect. I like this version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS on several fronts. Most notably and as mentioned, the astonishing visual aesthetics. The film does justice to costumes and sets and location. It captures the grace and opulence of French architecture, never mind that the film was shot in Bavaria. Other than the distracting spoken anachronisms, it's a fun and irreverent take. The film executes a series of dynamic action sequences, with Aramis being played up as the man of the cloth who fights with ninja-like precision. Thankfully, there actually are nice bits of swordplay and enough rousing swashbuckling to recollect THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. The tone of the characters mimics the original, only extremely exaggerated. As ever, the burnt-out Athos (an excellent Matthew Macfadyen) proves to be the most complex and interesting Musketeer. Unlike other adaptations, this film does focus more on Athos and Milady de Winter's history. Milady de Winter belongs in the Femme Fatale Hall of Fame, and, as Athos learns, you roll the dice when you have truck with a temptress whose attributes include a ""gift for corruption and a penchant for betrayal."" There are slow bits to this movie, and eye-rolling bits. And, more often than not, the stabs at humor miss the mark. The anachronistic elements could've been downplayed or just done away with. And I wasn't entirely sold on Jovovich as Milady or Orlando Bloom as the Duke of Buckingham. But it's worth a watch for the visual spectacle and the slick action. But you may wince when you hear a demoted-to-street patrol Aramis handing D'Artagnan a citation and accusing him: ""Your horse took a dump on the street."" You can apply that as a metaphor, if you like.

4692363,4,B005GNZRMW,"This was a fun updating of the beloved action classic full of youthful exuberance and outlandish costumes with a Matrix feel for the whole affair.  Porthos, Athos, and Aramis are played out as superhero agents of France's dolt of a king who's heart is really in the right place (and, oh, his horrid outfits are cringe-funny!) and who all come into contact with rash, young D'Artagnon who helps to restore their faith in the Musketeers and their liege.  Milla Jovovich (of Resident Evil fame) plays the scheming, double-crossing Milady de Winter in league with a fey Duke of Buckingham (played by Pirates of the Carribean's Orlando Bloom) and the costumes and outfits they wear are a huge part of this film's outlandishness.  The quite literal air ships are very cool and if only they would have been real!  Outlandish is a good word to describe this bit of fun fiction (directed by much maligned Paul W.S.

4692365,3,B005GNZRMW,"Whenever I watch a ""period"" film that's liberally punctuated with anachronistic elements, I automatically assume the writers are either too lazy or stupid to properly research the period in question (hoping instead that viewers won't notice their mistakes or believe that they are hip and edgy because of them!).
I will say this movie was beautiful to look at.  Obviously, a lot of money was spent on sets, locations, and the incredible costumes (the wigs were another matter).  Less money was used on the screenplay and it shows.  As mentioned by others, the story had a tendency to wander from the source material.  When it bothered to adhere to some of the plotline, it came across as Classics Illustrated for those who have no intention of reading Alexandre Dumas' book Les Trois Mousquetaires.  Worse, this new, and supposedly improved, story began as a caper flick, complete with slow motion action sequences (a device I've never understood nor appreciated as it defies the term action).  At least the swordplay was fun.  I won't even go into the balloons or the pirate battle in the sky.  They could be looked upon as either stupendous or just plain stupid.  Really, dirigibles, has someone confused their centuries?
As for the actors, with their accents askew, only a handful redeemed themselves, the rest were just an odd assortment of misplaced thespians in search of their character.  The worst of the lot was Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu.  His performance was flat, every scene in which he appeared he failed to register.  If it wasn't for the red outfit, I wouldn't have known he was there.  Also less than impressive was Mads Mikkelsen as Captain Rochefort.  Where was the menace?  He was supposed to be the chief villain behind the evil Richelieu.  An eye patch does not a villain make.  Another odd choice was Milla Jovoich as Milady de Winter; did no one think to clue her in as to what type of movie she was making?  Yes, standing out is usually a good thing, here, she was just out there.  And then there was Musketeer Junior, Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan with his decidedly American accent.  Hello, where were the French in all of this!?
Once it was over, with the obvious threat of a sequel, I was left wondering if I really enjoyed what I just saw or not.  I honestly can't say I hated it, but I also can't say I loved it either.  Which leaves me with the dilemma, to keep or not to keep?  (I bought it used and in pristine condition.  Cheap.)  Maybe I will watch it again.",1343347200,5,2502,4.670480549199085
4692366,1,B005GNZRMW,"You would think that one director would sit back, look at his work in its entirety, and say: ""Hey! That's a great film! I feel satisfied in the job I have done, through the art I've perfected."" You would think they would do that, but Paul... Webster-Gusterson(Whatever) has given us a new example of how that is not at all a part of film-making, anymore. In this review, I will outline some of the ways that Gary Paulson(Shut up, I know there's a Paul in there) betrayed both the writing of Alexander Dumas and the people of France by simply not thinking about what he was doing... AT ALL.

Reason number 1: This isn't resident evil! Be creative and pick another intro!

So basically Paul Crackin-bush decided that a ridiculous break-in sequence, with weird character profiles, was a better idea than actually having something interesting that perpetuated the unfolding of a good plot. Instead we deviate away from the book entirely with some crazy Indiana Jones excuse to look at Milla's boobs... Not that I'm complaining. We find out later that what they were stealing was a set of plans for a balloon that does nothing but break the laws of physics in a plot-armor kind of way. But I'll get to that later.

Reason number 2: No one cast this film properly or bothered to make the dialect consistent.

So for those of you outside of the ""Biz,"" movies are usually cast by character type. You match a character type, like a lady from the days of yore, it's usually a safe choice to cast you in exactly that role. Orlando Bloom, in this movie plays the exact opposite of his type, and it shows. In his more successful films(Lord of the Rings, Kingdom of Heaven, Pirates of the Caribbean) He plays pretty much the same character; an quiet youth devoted to a mission, which is a brilliant place to put him. In this he plays exactly the opposite; they try to make him outgoing and evil. I tried to make my paycheck bigger by using white out... but that didn't work either.

This is such a general problem throughout the film, that it really makes me wonder if anyone put any effort into this at all. Even D'artanian's father has a Brooklyn accent. What gives?

Reason number 3: Cliches and stolen lines.

Every line in this movie either makes no sense or has been stolen from another movie. It's not even subtle, they set up the dialog specifically to use stolen lines like: ""Anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something."" We've all seen the princess bride! Constance is snarky for no reason, M'lady says predictable things that still manage to seem out of character; really the script is such a cluster f**k I can't list all of the problems with it.

Reason number 4: The flying machine and the fact that Paul Anderson-Smith doesn't know how to use google earth.

So this aspect of the movie is so wrong in so many ways, it's really going to be difficult for me to explain in full detail. So in case I miss something, here's a summary: Being in a balloon does not make you go faster, and you cannot travel to London, from Paris, and back in five days by horse and boat! It's impossible and you'd know that if you spent time hitchhiking through Europe, or have spent any time there at all. Even just looking out a plane window you'd be like:""Damn, that shit's kinda big. Maybe I should rethink this movie thing... Entirely.""

Anyway, the main problem comes into play when they make a big deal out of a war machine, that is essentially a ship tied to a balloon(moving target), that Orlando's character has built. It's all wrapped up in secrecy and kept very hush hush until HE LANDS IT ON THE KINGS FRONT LAWN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM! Guess it's not a secret anymore, guess that opening WAS a complete waste of time, like Blair said. When everyone knows everything about what the threat is, and looks up at it and goes:""Hmm... Pretty cool, I want one,"" watching a movie becomes as tedious as watching a guy work out a complicated mathematical proof.

So after this, there's a plot to frame the queen for sleeping with Orlando's terribly unlikable character, by planting some jewels in the tower of London or whatever(I've read the book, and I'm still confused by the motives in this movie). The king tests her by saying: ""Wear the jewels I gave you, in five days... Cause I want you to be pretty and stuff..."" She discovers that she doesn't have them and the real plot starts, I guess.

So let's do some math!

We have five days. It takes them one day to realize and alert the musketeers, so now we have four days. Calais is 181 miles away from Paris, that trip, if you don't want your horse to die before you get there is a good 2 to 3 day trip. Then you cross the English channel and travel all the way to London... Wait... We're already out of time. Guess the queen's been exposed by now, just in the time it took to get there.

Do you see what I mean? There's no possible way that this could work at all.

Number 5: So the master plan is...

Okay so here's the stupid master plan, to get the diamonds back, in the following order:

Step 1: Have D'artanian get captured.

Step 2: Hijack M'lady's carriage.

Step 3: Steal an airship.

Step 4: Use the airship to save D'artanian from the arrest that did nothing.

Step 5: Hijack M'lady's... um carriage?

Step 6: Sail back to France in a balloon.

If it was so easy to steal an airship why didn't they just do that. Better still: Why not just wait for m'lady to get in the carriage and gang up on her. Seems much easier and it's only two steps.

""But Blair, they could only do that stuff because D'artanian was a decoy! Be fair!""

You mean this fortress exhausted all of the men guarding it to go get D'artanian. That makes even less sense.

There are so many more facets of this movie that don't make any sense, I really would die of exhaustion writing all of them down. But really the point of this rant is this: When it comes to making movies like this, you need to make it accurate to give us a reason to care about the tension in the story. This has no attention or care put into it, and is basically garbage shoved onto the screen.

The only thing it's good for, at this point, is to supply us with a reason to laugh at the director's expense.",1343174400,15,6212,4.412073490813648
4692367,1,B005GNZRMW,"I have read The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas and have seen many of the movie versions.  This is by far one of the worst movies based on Dumas' work right next to The Musketeer.  While Matthew Macfadyen did a good job of being Athos and Luke Evans was ok as Aramis, there was so much of the characterizations necessary to create Athos, Aramis, Porthos and D'Artagnan which was missing.  Where was the womanizing Aramis (except in the opening scene)?  The worst casting by far was D'Artagnan.  From the messed up hair, to poor acting Logan Lerman could not even attempt to pull off the arrogant Gascon.  And Milla Jovovich as M'Lady de Winter and Orlando Bloom as Buckingham were horrid!

But despite the miscasting I still gave the movie a try only to watch it revolve around flying ships...  No plot, horrible casting, and bad acting makes me wonder why this even made it onto a movie screen in the first place.",1342915200,4,918,4.588957055214724
4692368,4,B005GNZRMW,"This movie was great for what it was intended to be:  mindless fun action.  I am surprised by all the negative reviews that complain about how unrealistic and unlike the books it was.  Hmmm... the flying ship on the cover didn't give that away to you?  If you like movies like Tomb Raider, The Rundown, etc., then you will probably like The Three Musketeers.",1342137600,8,358,4.546875
4692369,2,B005GNZRMW,"I know, this is an easy target. But the weirdest thing is, the hack screenwriters actually read the source material! To wit --

- They get a lot of the names right for minor characters, like Jussac;
- In the first duel, Rochefort gets distracted from killing d'Artagnan by Milady's arrival;
- Porthos really does sponge off women in order to afford the latest fashions;
- Aramis really does sarcastically pray for his enemies after killing them (that's actually in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twenty-Years-After/dp/0199537267/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twenty Years After</a>);
- Athos really does take Richelieu's written indulgence from Milady by force;

-- and so on. And where the movie does depart from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/source-material/dp/0486456811/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">source material</a>, a lot of its visual invention is actually pretty good. The ""toy army"" visuals in the opening make it clear that we're going to emphasize the fun, adventurous part of the story. And the reinterpretation of the musketeers' appearance is quite clever. Porthos as a shaven-headed, leather-clad tough guy is a good way to make him comprehensible to a modern audience. He's supposed to be imposing and brawny, and these visual cues convey that more clearly than the more historical depiction with long hair and lace doilies. Richelieu's contemptuous flattery of the king is perfect. The king himself becomes an effete teenager desperate for the queen's approval. He was much more cruel in the book, but this is a surprisingly good way to set up his jealousy of Buckingham. And, although d'Artagnan is a smirking, self-absorbed jerk...well, that part is actually kind of accurate.

So the film-makers aren't talentless. The problem is that they have no respect for their audience. I know, it's Hollywood and that's hardly surprising, but still, one dares to dream.

For example, the film-makers wanted their movie to appeal to pubescent boys. I can just imagine the boardroom meeting: ""All right, people, this brainstorming session will determine our bottom line! If we don't make our target ticket sales, you hack writers are out on the street! Now, what do the little SOBs like nowadays?"" ""Flatulence!"" ""Ninjas!"" ""Explosions!"" ""Hot chicks!"" ""Maybe we can make them fly? They did that in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B00005JPNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>, and kids love Transformers."" ""What about kung fu? That's what they do in those Japanese cartoons, right? Kids love those!"" ""All right. Flying kung fu ninja chicks OK with everyone?""

So, yeah, the good guys and bad guys fly on airships, and they launch explosives at each other, and stuff blows up. Needless to say, this leaves little room for dialogue. In fact, the need for more explosions seems to force the director to cut out parts of the script, so that the remaining dialogue is incomprehensible. So, Milady gets thrown off the port bow, and the bad guys are holding Constance hostage, and then Athos suddenly stops and makes a speech to d'Artagnan about the importance of seizing the day and living in the moment, as opposed to blind loyalty to king and country, whereupon d'Artagnan is motivated to save her. Leaving aside the question of whether this is in character (hint: no), it makes no sense. In this situation, rescuing Constance coincides with the king's interests. And if he meant that her safety is more important than the king's mission, attempting a rescue actually endangers her more. I think that no one read over the script, and this part is only there because that's the part in movies where the aloof guy is supposed to say something to motivate the brash guy.

Also, the duel with Jussac is turned into a big kung-fu set-piece in which the musketeers slaughter about a hundred dudes. Contemporary directors have problems with this sort of thing. They mistakenly believe, having played too many bad video games, that fight scenes are more impressive if the heroes are shown single-handedly mowing down dozens of inept, faceless bad guys. In fact, the opposite is true. In the book, this duel takes place between four musketeers and five Cardinal's guards. This number of opponents is sufficient to make the scene immortally gripping, because the guards are part of an elite, some of the best swordsmen in France. A one-on-one duel can be terrifying, as long as the opponent convincingly looks like he knows his way around a deadly weapon. With a horde of opponents, however, there is no chance to demonstrate any actual fencing skill, and the scene is reduced to magical kung-fu decimating incompetent enemies while the camera impotently spins around.

There's also some of that jolly old broad humour dealing with d'Artagnan's defecating horse and Planchet's alleged obesity. You know, there is nothing wrong with appealing to pubescent boys. But, during the past 100 years, The Three Musketeers has had no problem appealing to them. The thing is, the novel went for a rise. It appealed to their desire to be smarter, stronger, and more skillful, to their curiosity about the world, and to their fondness for rituals and secrets. The idea of political sophistication was interesting to them. Really, people are capable of more than Hollywood directors think.",1341619200,4,5426,5.421800947867299
4692370,4,B005GNZRMW,"Another movie version of ""The Three Musketeers"", how refreshing and how utterly tedious of an idea. The Musketeers successfully pull off a heist they are betrayed by Milady (Milla Jovovich, ""The Resident Evil"" franchise) and the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise).

So as we all know the Musketeers must reband together, they gain the help of D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman, ""Percy Jackson and The Olympians: The Lightning Thief""), go through to the country and France and bring peace. Of course they must also fight in some good fight sequences, have some good banter and keep the pace of the film going along good even though this has all been told, retold and re-retold many times before.

At least this one has some flare to it and a good cast, Bloom is the usual cheesy and unsavory villain as The Duke, Jovovich is simply stunning, Lerman makes for a good young hero and the Musketeers are entetaining also. As stated before the action sequences are well done, the action doesn't get anymore overblown than your standard action movie and well its mindless entertainment. Its not what I call great or even very good, but its decent and lively enough not to be too boring throughout. **1/2 out of 4 stars.",1341187200,4,1237,4.775700934579439

It is the exact same story that's been done 100 times already but they added in DaVinci's flying machine or some such thing...I couldn't even get into it enough to pay attention to the details because it was so utterly disappointing right from the beginning! My kids distracted me from the flick and I was happy to let them because I was so bored....

Throughout the entire movie the main character D'Artagnan's hair was plastered to his metaphorical and literal huge head. I really hated this movie. Don't Buy it.",1339459200,,476,4.817073170731708
4692376,2,B005GNZRMW,"I watched only 30 minutes of the ""Three Musketeers"" before being driven away by all the strutting egomaniacs.  For a movie to get 3 stars or more, it has to be at least good enough to keep me watching the whole thing!

A tip to film-makers who want their films to be popular: give the ""Good Guys"" some likeable qualities.  Make them human, don't make them utterly invincible, and even give them a few weaknesses.  Most people don't like pompous, invincible, cocky egomaniacs, if they are supposed to identify with them as the Good Guys.  In the ""Three Musketeers"" it seems as though the whole cast is full of arrogant megalomaniacs.  It's just that the 3 ""good"" Musketeers are the smiling, ultra-confident type of egomaniac, while the bad guys are the frowning, evil type.  And then there's the ""boy"" Musketeer, D'Artagnan, who seems to be a cocky teenage superman (extremely unlikeable), and the female lead, named ""Milady,"" is the cocky, back-stabbing, sexy type (also very unlikeable, although she is on the Dark Side).  Then, of course, are various other types of bad guys, the worst being, of course, the Cardinal, who is a hypocritical, religious egomaniac, and the evil Rochefort, who is a nasty egomaniac.  30 minutes into this thing, I realized that I didn't like any of the characters.

Then there's the gimmicky, ""gadget"" flavor to the movie, where, for example, a Musketeer dispatches about 5 soldiers with some sort of whirling machine-gun crossbow.  The gimmicky gadgetry seems silly & distracts.

But when the Musketeers along with D'Artagnan are surrounded by about 50 soldiers, and then proceed to easily slaughter them (D'Artagnan acrobatically dispatching about 20 himself), I had had enough.  I had to quit watching it.  I was really cheering for the soldiers to get in some good sword licks on some of those cocky jerks.  Maybe even dispatch one, or at least make them sweat.  Nope, all the poor soldiers were bascially cannon-fodder for the Supermen Musketeer Assassins.  Perhaps better actors could have made me care more about their characters.

Being a huge fan of the Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, and Michael York version, the new casting looked great. Matthew Macfayden is wonderful and he was terrific in the new version of Pride and Prejudice so he's not the issue, nor is the rest of the new cast. How could it all go so terribly wrong? The new script was ridiculous. It bears little resemblance to Alexandre Dumas' story. Perhaps it should have been positioned as a parody or fantasy version like Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Slayer. Then people who are fans of the original version of the Musketeers series would not be so puzzled by this version. This new version is a prime example of how dangerous special effects can be in the wrong hands. A total waste of a great cast, a classic story, and a huge budget. The end of the movie sets the story up for a sequel. If indeed that is the case, I hope there is an intervention before this tragic cinematic release is continued. There is always hope for a better script and less CGI. Remember Star Trek: The Motion Picture (terrible) vs. Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (terrific)?

It was similar to slow death with the sound of nails on a chalkboard while getting water-boarded 183 times like Kalid Sheikh Muhammad.

The historical line is so far from anything remotely accurate, which would be fine, but the story line, character development and ChuckyCheese vibe of the movie had me squirming in my seat the whole time.

I am literally considering buying this movie just to break it into one-thousand pieces like the scene from office space. I have been traumatized and completely offended by the powers that be whom allowed this movie to happen.

4692385,4,B005GNZRMW,"I've been a fan of the Musketeers since I saw the 70's versions.  Disney's rendition was just bleh... The Musketeer was cool.  The 70's ones were awesome.  This one is closer to those, imho, and threatened to unseat the original as my favourite, but I don't think it can quite cut it... close, though.

* SPOILERS BELOW *

I really don't understand why people are complaining that it's an action flick... or super-hero-esque... that's what the Musketeers are! I personally don't care whether or not it remains ""true"" to the original story, whatever, exactly, that might mean.

Though the story is a little used because of the previous movies, it feels pretty fresh. But they did actually put some effort into the characters and plot and made them different than in the older movies, but just as good.

That they made D'Artagnan younger and gave him an age-related dynamic with the Louis was neat.  That they made him that young also fit with his cockiness much better than the older incarnations in the other movies.  Louis was hysterical, and I'm glad they made him somewhat of a twit. The dialog was witty, funny, and well written (except for one part below). The sword fighting was extremely fun to watch, which is part of why I like the originals so much.

That said, there were a couple of things that weren't so great.  I hate that ploy where writers give the main character some witty remark early on in the movie, and have him repeat it at the end... IT'S LAME, and it was lame when it happened in this movie.  It wasn't, however, a deal killer.  Milla Jovavich was disappointing, though, and she's the reason I had to give the movie only 4 stars.  She left the role feeling pretty empty, which is sad. I haven't enjoyed a single movie of hers since  The 5th Element.

None of the characters, I thought were particularly interesting. The acting I thought was average.

The actual filming was brilliant. The colors, the buildings, the scenery, the special effects, the costumes, all very good.

The action scenes were reasonable. What struck me was the lack of blood in them. People getting hit by swords but no blood. It seemed so fake.

4692394,4,B005GNZRMW,"Since the 1800's, the tale of ""The Three Musketeers"" has entertained generation after generation.

Beginning with the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the 17th century tale would feature a young man named d'Artagnan leaving home to join the Musketters of the Guard which consisted of Athos, Porthos and Aramis.

And within this last century, there have been musicals, films, games and animated TV series based on the characters featured in the novel.

But as the story has been retold countless times, there was no doubt that the story of the Three Musketeers would receive a film adaptation and for filmmaker W.S. Anderson (""Death Race"", ""AVP: Aliens vs. Predator"", ""Resident Evil"" films), in order for the story not too be to banal or boring, and attract a new generation of viewers, it was time to change things up by tweeking the storyline and also modernizing it.

And so, screenwriters Alex Litvak (""Predators"") and Andrew Davies (""Bridget Jones's Diary"", ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"") would be responsible in giving audiences a new fresh storyline featuring the Three Musketeers and the characters created by Alexandre Dumas.

The 2011 film would feature cinematography by Glen MacPherson (""Rambo"", ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"") and music by Paul Haslinger (""Underworld: Awakening"", ""Death Race 2', ""Crank"").  And while this big budget film would utilize modern technology for CG, Paul W.S. Anderson also wanted realism and that was to create actual sets of the airships, to shoot in Bavaria for its use of French and Italian architecture and also for its talent to undergo swordfighting bootcamp.

The film would earn over $135 million in the box office worldwide and now the film will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Summit Entertainment in March 2012.

VIDEO:

""The Three Musketeers"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and as one would expect for a big budget action film, the film looks absolutely beautiful.  For one, there are a lot of vibrant colors featured in the outdoor scenes, but it's the location of shooting in Bavaria that lends to the film feeling it's 17th Century and most importantly, CG that helps compliment in the recreation of that world.

The production and set design, along with costume design is magnificent and on HD, you are able to see the detail of the clothing, to the sparks flying when the metal swords are striking each other and also seeing the clarity and detail of the surroundings of the area. The CG work is quite impressive and for the most part, this is a vibrant and well-detailed film.

I didn't notice any edge enhancement, artifacts or banding while watching this film.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are nice and deep and overall, this film looks beautiful on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Three Musketeers"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.

As one can expect from an action film, not only do you get immersive sound during the action sequences, the music composed by Paul Haslinger sounds wonderful.  First, the action sequences.  From the clanging of swords, cannon balls being shot from airship to airship, explosions galore and wonderful panning from right to left, left to right.  And while the second half does feature most of that immersive sound during the action sequences, dialogue and music is crystal clear as well.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Three Musketeers"" have entertained generation after generation for over 150 years.

But for those of us who grew up watching ""The Three Musketeers"" in cinema or cartoons, while the swashbuckling swordsman storylines were great decades ago, for this society use to immersive video game playing, big budget special effects and heroes that have a ""cool factor"", bringing ""The Three Musketeers"" to a new generation is rather tricky.

Bring in director Paul W.S. Anderson, known for action films such as the ""Resident Evil"" films, ""Death Race"" and ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" and a person who is willing to modernize and give a refreshing perspective to the storyline but also targeting this new generation who may have passed on reading or watching anything that would have to do with ""The Three Musketeers"".

And while listening to the audio commentary by Paul W.S. Anderson and him describing a scene which was inspired by the video game ""Assassins Creed II"", I knew immediately that he's going after an audience who loves their popcorn action, an audience who loves special effects and of course, having the beautiful Milla Jovovich in another action role does not hurt at all.

But with that being said, Anderson is known for popcorn action films and in no way or form was he going to recreate the films that were made in the past.  This was going to be straight-up action like his previous films and for those who are familiar with his work, you know what you're going to get.

First the positives.  What I enjoyed about ""The Three Musketeers"" was the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson wanted to make D'Artagnan as he was in the original book, an older teenager.  I also liked the fact that he shot in Bavaria and instead of sets created or CG buildings, we are seeing the actual architecture of long ago featured in a film.  Granted, to recreate popular buildings in Paris, there was CG used but still, there is no denying that this film looks good, from its design, set design and even the costume design.

Another positive is the fact that Anderson wanted to achieve realism by having the talent undergo bootcamp and learn how to use a sword.  This went for several months and it shows in the film.  Another is building sets, especially the airships and then using CG when needed, but not use CG to completely build the airships.  So, that was a positive touch.

Also, the characters seem rather fun, especially having Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovich as the antagonists.  It was great to see everyone also belittle the servant Planchet and if anything, this was a good popcorn action film that delivered in action and special effects.

The bad news which may be bad for those familiar with the series is that this is not the same Three Musketeers that many people grew up with.  While the Three Musketeers are featured in the film, this is a story primarily focused on D'Artagnan and some may feel the ego and bravado was a bit too overbearing.

Some may also roll their eyes of the modernization of the film.  With people battling with airships, yes...17th century wooden ships that are flying in the sky with blimps using Leonardo da Vinci's blueprints.

And last, a storyline that is driven to action scene after action scene while the storyline is there, it's more to boost its action sequences.  Swordfights, airship fights, etc.

And for those who want a cinematic experience with strong characters with awesome character development and a deep, intellectual storyline, this film is not it.  Once again, look at Paul W. S. Anderson's oeuvre and you know that he is a director that specializes in action films and he rarely deviates from that.

I personally have enjoyed Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" films and I usually know what I'm going to get with his films and with ""The Three Musketeers"", it was what I expected, a popcorn action film set in the 17th century with modernization and plenty of action and I enjoyed it to the point where I hope there is a sequel.  I never came to this film expecting anything deep or cerebral because I was familiar with Anderson's work and in a sense, his storyline does play to a new generation of audiences who enjoy popcorn action films with plenty of special effects and fighting such as ""The Pirates of the Last Caribbean"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Alien vs. Predator"", ""Transformers"", etc.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic.  Colors are vibrant, detail is amazing and the film looks great on Blu-ray and I can say the same about the lossless audio. Great use of panning of audio from the surround channels, plenty of immersive action sequences that fill up the soundscape and dialogue and music is crystal clear.  And also you get plenty of special features, although I tend to not like ""making of"" being offered by watching the movie a second time.  I prefer to have these separated.  But it is subjective and that is my own personal preference.

Is it keeper?  One may want to rent it first to see if it's for them, but for those who enjoy Paul W.S. Anderson films or action films in general, it may be an action film they may want to have in their Blu-ray collection.

Overall, ""The Three Musketeers"" is an action-packed film that features impressive special effects, wonderful costume set design and a fast-paced storyline.  It's definitely not the same ""Three Musketeers"" that many have grew up with in the past but a modernized, reboot of the characters for a new generation of moviegoers who love popcorn action films.",1336176000,3,10205,4.899825276645312

4692404,3,B005GNZRMW,"I really enjoy period piece movies and the story of the Three Musketeers. My favorite version being the 1993 telling of the story starring  Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, and Tim Curry. That version had a sense of fun, whimsical adventure which is lacking in this movie. I was very excited to see this movie because the visuals looked stunning and they certainly are. Although the story does deviate from the classic tale by Alexandre Dumas, most filmed version have taken license with the plot, just not to the extent that this current incarnation of the tale does. Having said that, my complaint is not with the story line itself just some of the mechanization of the plot; namely the use of the airship.

I understand the need to suspend disbelief in movies such as this but the inclusion of flying airships made it a bit to difficult for me to do that at times. It just seemed so out of place and it had me rolling my eyes at times. I will say that it is very nicely designed and rendered in the film.

My other complaint with the movie is the development of the characters. Generally in the telling of the story the main protagonist is Cardinal Richelieu. However, in this version the ""bad guy"" role is spread out among four characters;  Cardinal Richelieu, Captain Rochefort, the Duke of Buckingham and the Countess de Winter. With evil spread across so many characters motivations are a bit diluted. Also, the  Musketeers themselves seem bland and a bit dark and depressing for my tastes.

Now for the positives. This movie is a feast for the eyes! The CGI in this movie is stunning and spectacular. The sets and the costumes are great and the movie really transports you to another place and time and I do like that aspect of the movie. Freddie Fox gives a very humorous and over-the-top performance of a spoiled fashion obsessed King Louis XIII. Juno Temple is equally charming and delightful as Queen Anne. The sword fights and the action scenes are also exciting and well filmed.

If I were ever to try to watch it again, I would have to try and look at it as a comedy rather than an action film.  I've seen 5 different versions of the 3 musketeers, and this is by far the worst.

4692411,2,B005GNZRMW,"I seriously hate it when movie writer's, producer' and director's dumb down classic literature or history to ""grab"" today's younger audiences. This is a prime example! Very little has to do with the actual book. It's not even true to the character's of the book. The Indiana Jones-ish booby traps are ridiculous, that not even a great inventor the caliber of Leonardo DaVinci could have thought up during the period of which the Three Musketeers takes place. Especially since DaVinci himself would never have thought of a need for such a vault. They never go to Italy, they never get kicked out of the Musketeers, (nor has the muketeers been disbanded as in other film adaptations). Constance isn't the Queens Lady-In-waiting either, and she's married. That aside, the entire concept of the movie is crap.

Did they write the story first and hire Milla Jovovich second or the other way around. Milady is cunning, but not the limber acrobatic, mission impossible drop from the roof, Resident Evil kick butt villain portrayed here. Orlando Bloom is utterly wasted and looks ridiculous. His hair is an 80's flashback nightmare! I do enjoy Logan Lerman; however he is wrongly cast as D'artagnan. In the novel, his character is almost 20, so his casting was spot on for the age. I had trouble believing him as D'artagnan. He is still young and a relative newcomer; I do not believe that he held his own against much more seasoned actors. I do look forward to watching him grow as an individual and an actor.

The flashy style used to capture the kids is out of place. The weapons used by Athos in the beginning you would expect to see in an over-the-top, unrealistic martial arts film. Buckingham's war ""ballons"" is more Avatar, The Last Airbender than 17th century Europe.

The only reason I gave it to stars rather than one is because at the very least my kids should enjoy it (hopefully), so my money won't be completely wasted. well, they'll enjoy it until they're mature enough to read the real story (not the kid friendly versions).",1334620800,,2033,4.769886363636363

I personally wouldn't have cast Lerman as D'Artagnan because, to me, he looks like he's about 12 (I much perfer something closer to Chris O'Donnell's version). The rest of the casting was pretty fabulous!  Orlando Bloom as a villain was hilariously refreshing.

I ordered the product and as always Amazon shipped it very very promptly.  I popped it in and to my surprise I actually enjoyed this film.  It gave my subwoofers and buttkicker option in my chair a real workout in the scenes with the cannon fire.  The 3D affects were fantastic.  I recently learned about settings for my 3D TV which were somewhat hidden and having adjusted them I have to say watching 3D is fantastic.  I adjusted the brightness and contrast with a test disc and was able to compensate for the affect of the 3D Glasses.

I have to say story wise I was quite surprised that Orlando Bloom was not one of the Muskateers and was a villian.  I enjoyed the casting of Christoper Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu, he is always a great villian as in Water For Elephants and Inglorious Bastards.  I did like the casting of the Muskateers in the version with Keifer Sutherland and Oliver Platt.

I was happy to see that the door was set for a sequel, which I hope they make.  According to Wikepedia the movie was financially successful.  I think that 3D may catch on as the hardware gets better as I went through two TV's and Three Players before I got to where I was happy and satisfied with the results.

But for all the glitz and explosions, it plods along like an old horse. On very big problem is the lead played by Logan Leman. I am sure he is talented but this was not a good role for him. He was stiff, unconvincing and incredibly dull to watch. The other actors too were bogged down by a very poorly written script. There was a (in my view) a very obvious attempt to mimic the humor in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. The ""new and improved"" story-line was hard to follow and just plain boring. The thing is this is a good story and it could have been a terrific movie. I really have to wonder how this went from ""neat concept"" to ""crappy movie"".",1333843200,2,986,4.423076923076923

Logan Lerman is pretty cool, and Milla Jovovich, Christopher Watlz, and Ray Stevenson are always cool.

Unfortunately, I'm still waiting.  This is a comic book-like adaptation which is poorly casted, heavy on computer generated imagery, and without the slightest regard for realism, sophistication, or historical accuracy. (17th century zeppelin ships...really?!)  Even though it had a few admirable moments, words simply cannot express the pure lunacy and absurdity of this picture.  At no point will you feel like you're living in the time and place of the story, and isn't that what watching movies is all about?

I would only recommend this film for youngsters with short attention spans or people who love not films, but video games.

If you really want to see a musketeer film achieving greatness in every category (casting, costuming, direction, cinematography, etc.) there's no doubt you need to see Richard Lester's ""Three Musketeers"" and ""Four Musketeers"" filmed back-to-back in 1973.

Overall, I thought this movie was pretty good despite all the negative review. I was actually really interested to watch this in the theaters a few months back.

This movie is pretty much like The A-Team (lots of ""thoughtful planning""), Mission Impossible, The Matrix (slow motion action) and some Assassins Creed (Da Vinci's projects and technology) put together.

This movie was entertainingly funny and great for the family and kids, nothing to worry about with ""adult content""; just a few kissing scenes nothing more. You won't see any guts flying out from the swordplay/gun fights in this movie. If you're looking for action and [few] laughs then this movie would be the one to watch. I also liked how the storyline was unpredictably unfolded all the way to the end so all my guesses aren't always correct.

My only complaint was that I was left confused on who is the antagonist(s) of this movie in the end and some (or maybe half of the) scene transitions were too subtle/confusing like things were left out. I guess I'll found out later if there is a sequel to this movie. :]

Other than that, this is a pretty good movie and my mom actually wanted me to buy this movie now a week after we watched it. I actually preferred this movie more than Immortals, in my opinion.

And another side note, I thought Aramis was played by Orlando Bloom this whole time... but he actually played the Duke of Buckingham (Luke Evans played Aramis) and I never noticed (a quick search online with their faces side by side is like 95% alike). Also, this movie didn't have to be 100% accurate because it's not a documentary.. some people might not mind that it isn't (like myself) and some people would mind that it doesn't add up right.",1332720000,5,1994,5.1419753086419755

4692434,3,B005GNZRMW,"Alexandre Dumas' classic story has been told over and over again, but never with quite as much imagination as this. Set in a time of opulence, it features quick-witted assassins, diabolical villains, and flying ships setting sail in stormy skies.

Every partnership must eventually end, and it is unfortunate for Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) that it ends with a betrayal by the woman he loves. Lady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) has not only broken his heart but made off with the object of his desire, a set of plans for a flying ship by da Vinci. Her choice to support an English rival Lord Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) over him leaves him devastated. But then, the Musketeers haven't much to do these days, since the youthful and foolish king has no further need of them, and the city of Paris is run by the Cardinal's Guards.

Four years later, this does not bode well for young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) when he arrives intent on becoming a Musketeer, with the swordsmanship skills and attitude to prove it. He is not in town for more than an hour before he has collided with Athos, refused to pay a ticket given to him by Aramis (Luke Evans), and insulted Porthos (Ray Stevenson). His intention to fight all three of them in individual duals goes amiss when the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard orders his arrest, leaving the Three Musketeers and their tag-along to stumble into the midst of a diabolical plot intent on catapulting France and England into war. The order of the day is to save the queen, out-maneuver Buckingham, and outsmart the Cardinal (Christoph Waltz)... on the ground, or in the sky.

What can I say about this movie? Ten minutes in and I was cringing over how awful it was. Normally, I really like Milla Jovovich, but she is horribly miscast here, lacking any screen presence or chemistry with her costars. Everyone else ranges from decent to mundane, all except for Bloom, who is having such a good time twirling his mustache (sometimes literally) that we cannot help but enjoy his scene-stealing performance. He appears to be fully aware of how absurd the entire thing is, but doesn't mind a bit. Unfortunately, we're expected to root for the budding romance between young DArtagnan and one of the queen's ladies in waiting, but neither of them can act their way out of a paper bag and have zero sexual tension. However, I will say that once you get over the rampant absurdities, this movie does become a lot of fun. Its main flaw is trying too hard and relying on too many gags, but by the midway point I was enjoying myself, and the final twenty minutes are terrific, ranging from the air battle to a swordfight on the roof of Notre Dame.

In all other respects, this film is absolutely gorgeous. Shot in real locations rather than sets, it presents us with the finest of French and German architecture, with breathtaking panoramas and exquisite interiors. The costuming is also gorgeous, from ruffled petticoats and underskirts to tailored pantaloons. Now and again a lovely musical score creeps in, and the CGI in the last half is flawless. This film is so stunning on Blu Ray that I'm tempted to forgive its faults for that alone. The cheekiness of this movie is evident from the opening scenes, in which the image freezes and the name of the character is splashed across the frame. Either this kind of silliness is going to hook you in or it isn't. If you are looking for a quality franchise the caliber of Pirates of the Caribbean, this is not it, but if you simply want to be entertained and gawk at some gorgeous costumes, give it a rental. It may not have much substance, but it certainly has style.",1332374400,4,3631,4.65990639625585

4692436,1,B005GNZRMW,"Given what I saw in the trailer, I wasn't expecting much. It's good to see that sometimes, you can judge the book by its cover.

This flick was random. The plot was random. The acting was random. The time period was random. The cinematography was.... well... I'm sure you get it by now. If someone in the production team for this film had a wild hair, it got incorporated into the script. Mission Impossible rappelling bit? Check. Steampunk style airship battles? Check. Oriental martial arts wired combat? Check. Indiana Jones/Lara Croft tomb raiding? Check. High flash rapier duels? Che... oh wait... most of the rapier fighting was outclassed by brawling. But at least there was a lot of brawling.

The core concept behind the Three Musketeers is the often quoted ""all for one, one for all."" It describes how personal loyalty, honor, and courage can and MUST stand against corruption no matter how much power (political or religious) backs the actions of villainous men. But in this adaptation, it's all about independent action... treachery and betrayal from within... lost hope... and trickery to ensure that everything turns out all right. Maybe that sort of 'shades of gray' storyline seems necessary to appeal to today's audiences; but if so, we should all be horribly shamed by our part in it.

Ironically, the one big deceit in the original (Anne's infidelity with Buckingham) is flipped into the reverse... a plot by the Cardinal that sends the diamonds to England to force the French King into going to war. Anne and her young King are evidently supposed to be the naive, innocent romantics of the piece. Fortunately, the heroes are able to capture an airship (literally a period wooden galleon suspended beneath vast canvas balloons - complete with fore, aft and broadside cannon placements) and save the day. Well... except for that fleet of airships crossing the channel there at the end. We wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to set up our sequel, would we?",1332201600,10,1976,4.927927927927928
4692437,3,B005GNZRMW,"There have been numerous filmed versions of Alexandre Dumas' swashbuckling tale THE THREE MUSKETEERS over the years, my favorite of which remains that starring Gene Kelly and June Allyson. Some have been good, some have been bad and many have been so-so. But it's been a while since one was made so I guess it was inevitable that we have a new one thus we have this latest version from director Paul W. S. Anderson, the director behind the RESIDENT EVIL series of films as well as 2 ALIEN sequels.

Right off the bat we notice a change as the original story has portions tossed aside and new more modern items included. The original 3 Musketeers - Athos (Matthew McFayden), Aramis (Luke Evans) and Porthos (Ray Stevenson) - are aided by Milady de Winter (Milla Javovich) in finding their way into the secret archives of the Vatican in hopes of stealing plans draw by da Vinci for a flying ship. The archives are protected by all sorts of traps that seem more along the lines of things we'd create these days than then. Once they take hold of the plans, they are betrayed by de Winter as she drugs them and hands the plans off to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom).

Several years pass and things change. A young man named D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves his family home in the hopes of joining the legendary Musketeers where his father once served. Along the way he has a losing fight with Rochefort (Mads Mikkelson), a high placed official in the government run by Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Waltz) but is saved by de Winter. When he arrives in Paris the brash youngster soon finds himself involved in not one but three duels with various men he bumps into not realizing that these are the legendary 3 Musketeers.

Before they can fight, they are set upon by Richlieu's guard and a sword fight ensues where D'Artagnan proves his mettle with the legends. Upon finishing they are called before the king to be chastised. Except the king rewards them instead while haphazardly telling them to behave. Thus the group of four are united and their loyalty to the crown and not to Richlieu, who hopes to take over control, demonstrated.

With the exception of the opening the movie thus far sticks to the original storyline. It continues with a necklace belonging to the Queen in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham but instead of her having gifted it to him here we have de Winter stealing it. That gives us more of an opportunity for Javovich to have a larger role than in the book as well as a chance for her to display the fighting/action techniques she's displayed in other roles, perhaps because he husband is the director. You think?

A dance is planned and Richlieu plants in the mind of the King that the Queen could prove her loyalty to him by wearing the necklace since he was the one responsible for de Winter stealing it. With only days to save the Queen the Musketeers are sent forth to retrieve the necklace and save the day. Along the way they come across various plans to stop them as well as numerous steam punk modernistic weaponry, including the flying airships. I have to assume that the makers of this film felt that today's youthful crowd would be hard pressed to accept anything less than a video game mentality when it came to weapons and fighting sequences.

All of these minor quibbles aside the film is an enjoyable piece of entertainment. The action sequences are well filmed and the effects are dazzling. The acting is far above what one would expect for something like this and the characters well though out and performed. Perhaps the only thing that seems odd is the number of various accents displayed when all characters involved are supposed to be French.

Anyone renting this will have a fun time at the movies so much so that it might even be worth adding to your collection should you be a swashbuckler or Musketeers fan. It will definitely offer you an evening of entertainment. My only major gripe comes at the end when a set up for a sequel is clearly put forth in the most unsubtle manner.

4692441,3,B005GNZRMW,"The poor acting for the roles of Cardinal Richelieu, Constance and Rochefort's captain of the guard  leave a LOT to be desired, and while a bit better in their performance, even Athos and the Duke of Buckingham (played by our beloved Orlando Bloom) were disappointing. (I give kudos to the Queen Anne in this version which was very well acted by Juno Temple).

The role of D'Artagnan is played by an actor with a face of an 8-yr old, the body of a scrawny 12-yr old boy, and one you are hard pressed to believe he'd ever had the slightest experience with any girls. While he seems to pull off the action movements smoothly, he is just all around NOT BELIEVABLE in this role and so (I believe) was a poor casting choice for a main character.

They (seem) to have spared no expense on the sets and costumes, and the addition of DaVinci's vault and his ""flying war ships"" were brilliant updates to the usual story, but they went a bit too high tech having laser beam security (of all things) in the queen's jewelry vault, and Melady using a small blow of powder from a compact to be able to see the beams.

BOTTOM LINE:  It is not without flaws, and in my opinion does not hold a candle to the 1993 version, (starring Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Tim Curry, Oliver Platt, Michael Wincott, and Chris O'Donnell - which is a tough version to beat!) but the sets, the DaVinci updates to the story, and the fight scenes are very enjoyable - (at one point they even slow down the action sequence for you, which I'm sure you'll appreciate) - so it's ABSOLUTELY WORTH VIEWING if you enjoy swashbuckling type movies.  Those who have not seen the 1993 version will surely think more highly of this version.

NOTE:  If you haven't seen the 1993 version I mentioned, I highly recommend that one - it's superbly done and very enjoyable.",1332028800,5,1825,4.492447129909365

There are no cars allowed on this island.  This castle is an exact copy of Versailles.  The film makers probably could not get permission to film in Versailles.  King Ludwig of Bavaria was a huge fan of the Sun King, Louis 16th and he dedicated several rooms to him which are inside this castle.

So it was no surprise that his rock 'em, sock 'em 3D update of Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers was not very good; even the Oscar-winning talent of Christoph Waltz could do little to save it. The story, pretty much recycled and beefed up with big action sequences and CGI, is familiar: Brash, young D'artagnan must team up with the titular trio to take down the scheming Cardinal Richelieu, who has disbanded the musketeers. Throw in a big supporting cast that includes Orlando Bloom, Mads Mikkelsen, Milla Jovovich, Juno Temple, Til Schweiger and more, and one would think it had a chance. Unfortunately, Anderson's The Three Musketeers has nothing new to set it apart from the long line of adaptations that preceded it, yet executed what it did have so poorly that it isn't worth watching.

4692456,5,B005GNZRMW,"It always amazes me that Hollywood never gets tired of doing remakes of some of their films, always trying to get it right. In fact, I was recently reading about the obsession of trying to make the best ""Great Gatsby"" version of them all, with new one of them coming out soon.  All these feelings came to mind when watching the newest remake of ""The Three Musketeers."" And let me tell you that I quite enjoyed this movie. It is what we go to the theaters for: it is exciting and fun and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, as the production is majestic and quite colorful.

The story is simple, but you can tell that a lot of thinking and planning went into designing it for the screen. The opening is fascinating, as a voice, using a map with miniatures, tells us that ""It is the dawn of the 17th Century and after the assassination of his father, the young king Louis XIII ascends to the throne."" We are also told that the king (Freddie Fox) is surrounded by enemies, including his advisor, feared Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), who is developing a plot to overthrow him. Enter Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), who makes an amazing entrance like a ninja; Aramis (Luke Evans), who does the same as sort of Batman; and Porthos (Ray Stevenson), who will remind you of the Joker. And this I say in a good way, as their appearances immediately tell you that this is great casting and that we are in for some fun. We also meet Milady De Winter (Milla Jovovich), a sexy, talented partner, who we will sadly discover is also a double-agent. The four of them team up to steal a blue-print of a DaVinci invention from the DaVinci vault in Venice. They succeed, but Milady fools the musketeers, and we learn that she was working for the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Enter, then,
D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman), who we meet while saying farewell to his parents, because he is leaving for Paris to become a musketeer. As fate has it, he does meet the musketeers, who at this time are down on their luck and fame, or, as Athos says, ""obsolete."" However, a valuable necklace with diamonds is stolen from the queen, and D'Artagnan convince the musketeers to get their act together and get the necklace back, And that is when the adventure begins.

It is understandable that some people do not feel right about how the classics are taken to the screen in a certain way, especially if the ambiance or the story doesn't reflect the environment of a given historical period. But modernization brought special effects and other things that make the studios compete to see who outdo each other. And that is what we get with this new, dynamic version of the Dumas' novel. I truly had a great time watching the action sequences and the great production design, which generates a great mix of history, due to its scenarios, and remarkable cinematic techniques. The way the movie ends, opens the possibility of a sequel, which is uncertain, given that the film sadly did not fare well at the box office. However, I hope that they find a way to do it. The DVD includes audio commentaries by cast and crew, making-of documentaries, deleted and extended scenes, and more. (Germany/France/ UK/ USA, 2011, color, 110 min plus additional materials)

4692458,1,B005GNZRMW,"When I saw this movie I was hoping for a great swash buckling costume drama. That was not what I got.  This movie was ridiculous, that was really the only word for it. I cannot imagine what the people who put this thing together were thinking. The plot staggers all over the place without any substance. There is no drive to the story, no point to carry the story along. None of the heros made any connection with me, and did not leave me caring what happened to them. My impression of the King of France was to wonder why anyone would bother to fight for him.  The villians were just plain silly.  The Cardinal, supposed to be the main driving mastermind villan of the story, instead comes across as vague, bland and uninteresting.  The Duke of Buckingham was played more like a villain from an old cartoon show. There is a difference between comedy and farce, but you would not be able to tell that from this movie, which was pure farce.

The sword fighting and special effects were nice to see, but nothing in the plot made any sense. The number of totally absurd things that happen are endless. You have whole fleets of flying boat/dirigibles, machine guns, flame throwers, intricate ""Temple of Doom"" type traps.

Plus a Milady character who is a James Bond/Indiana Jones superspy. She slaughters an entire company of well armed musketeers in one scene, all while garbed in an elaborate French court gown, complete with nine layers of petty coats, and never even musses her hair. She sword fights better than Zorro, evades booby traps better than any cat burglar, again while never getting her wardrobe unsettled. And all of this happening in the 17th century!  And so on and so forth.  I like a good fantasy, but this was utterly ridiculous!

It was a relief when this movie came to an end. If you like swashbucklers, or the Three Muskeeters, don't waste your time with this one.  If you are just curious, rent it but don't buy. It is not worth the time it took to watch.",1331596800,7,1976,4.540845070422535

This is the rare type of movie that is exactly what I expected. I thought it was gonna be boring with good fighting...and that's exactly what it is. The beginning and end are great but the story aspect is drawn out. I think that the main reason it felt that way is because this story has been re-done so many times that it begins to lose impact with every version. I don't really blame anyone for that but you can only do the same thing over and over before it becomes boring. Another example of Hollywood running out of ideas. Overall, not bad, not good, just OK.

4692460,4,B005GNZRMW,"Anderson started out as a great visual director, and while he gets the ""kid in a candystore"" syndrome that has killed the plotting of many of his films, his visual flair working on someone else's script elevates this film far past the wince-inducing bad previews. It doesn't hurt that the cast is top notch...all three Musketeers give great portrayals, d'Artagnan becomes charming after the 1st 3rd of his scenes, all the baddies are well-cast (although it appears poor Mads may have had physical problems during the end sequences that they were trying to cover), and even the incidentals, such as d'Artagnan's father, stand out in great performances. Jovovich shines in almost anything she does, and she's excellent here.
Constance....we need to drown Constance. The one misstep in casting. It's like trying to watch Keanu Reeves in Shakespeare.

The script is where the problems occur. It's not that they took liberties...what they changed all logically makes sense in an alternate tech timeline and are really quite well done if you don't hate the fact that they changed things. It's certainly better than the Disney script. It's not that it's a badly structured script...it's not.
No, the problem is that they don't know when it's good to be over the top, and when it's too much. For instance, the first act is fun, but too much, too fast (complete with comic booky Guy Ritchie style introductions)and too Mission Impossible: The Steampunk Years for the majority of the rest of the film. It makes the climax, which should be over the top for this film, a little anti-climatic.

But when this film works, it really shines. There are scenes in this film that just play like the scenes you'd remember from your favorite comic books as a kid, with punch and visual flair. There is an undeniable charm to this film that makes me want to own it on Blu and watch it every now again, despite what it does to the source material. (And there'd be a great drinking game trying to find all the nods to all the films made.)

Heart throb Olando Bloom who would have made the idea Aramis, plays a bad guy, The Duke of Buckingham. Aramis is instead played by Luke Evans. Milla Jovovich, stars as Milady de Winter the double agent, the love of Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) and Orlando Bloom. Ray Stevenson is a delightful Porthos which we don't get to see enough on the screen. D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) enters town looking for adventure on his odd looking horse named ""Buttercup"" which is not very manly, even in France.

D'Artagnan wants to join up with the trio, which due to budget cuts and the control of the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) has been dissolved. Through various circumstances they are joined together and have a new quest. Milla plays a woman who is skilled with the sword. Her slo-mo moves which she perfected in Resident Evil combat are used in this film. Likewise the foursome fight overwhelming odds.

Gabriella Wilde, plays Constance, a lady in waiting who has the heart of D'Artagnan. She delivers to them their impossible quest, one with little chance of success, having to fight and elude armies in two countries. A negative aspect of the film is the anachronistic warship which gave the movie an uncomfortable ""Wild Wild West"" feeling, perhaps for the teen appeal. RPG type fighting.

I did not go see it in 3d because personally 3d doesn't do much for me but the 2d experience was great. What I really enjoyed about this movie was that it had a little bit of everything, funny characters, semi-engaging storyline, romance, action, and good looking men ;)

To me the storyline was just right for the film, there was a lot going on with the characters interactions with each other and they did a good job of playing back to things that happen early in the film and adding twists, confusion, and even a few surprises. The characters all have their quirks from D'Artagnan's cocky statements to King Louis' insecurity's and childlike attitude. The film has an overall funny feel to it with a good deal of jokes and silly encounters which I really enjoyed. There's nothing like going to an action movie and getting some laughs out of it as well.

The romance aspect was small but effective as it helped move the storyline along in different ways. Different characters had to deal with different aspects of romance and each issue helped push the plot and characters in ways that were both expected and unexpected. As for the action all I can say is wow. I love watching a good sword fight happen and this movie was full of excellent swordplay. Along with swords, bombs, explosives, and guns were all used adding to the action.

This movie is not a tradition rendering of the Three Musketeers and has a steam punk feel to it making it a Three Musketeers for the modern age. Overall it was fun to watch and enjoy.
