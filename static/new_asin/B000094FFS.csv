1878418,5,B000094FFS,"This is not my style.  I balk at the opportunity to review a ...DVD flick (free shipping) suited for guys that enjoy T&A.  But I couldn't hold back this time.  While this movie review expresses my opinion about the 1984 period film (fashion, music and all the other foo-foo's), it is a guy's delight because of Karin Mani.  She is definitely the ""Alley Cat"" - the title of this film.  Visually she is a steaming beauty with a bod that any man would die for.  No silicone here...she is a living doll.  But why I share this review with all of you is because I admire what ""Alley Cat"" stands for.  This ""low"" budget film is extremely ""high"" profile.  It's all about a woman that takes out her frustration and revenge on the scum of the earth - the ""male jerk"".  She fights justice and mankind to stand up to the decadence and decay of society...namely the male species...JERKS!!!  Guys...rent this film for two reasons.  1 - It is a portrait of true female beauty.  2 - It is a sobering opportunity for every guy on the planet to appreciate, love and respect women as human beings - not sexual objects.  ""Alley Cat"" has poor acting...a lame script...a nostalgic music score seldom heard (understadably)...and a placement in film that many would consider ""B"".  Guys --- Karin is a beautiful physical specimen...from her neck down.  But when you give her a check-up from the neck-up, she stands for everything a woman desires...respect...love...understanding...romance and mutual intellect.  How did I get all of this (for not much money) DVD via Amazon.com???  Watch ""Alley Cat"" and you'll completely understand.  Right on Aretha Franklin.....R-E-S-P-E-C-T!!!!  A solid 10 in the low budget crime drama genre.",1078099200,16,1705,4.833910034602076
7989094,4,B000094FFS,Saw this movie back in 1982 and it was so hilarious that I couldn't stop laughing at the action scenes!,1452816000,,103,4.2
7989095,5,B000094FFS,the film was alright Karin Mani plays A young woman who's grandmother is killed by some thugs for some thing that took place earlier even though she makes attempts not let it get to her she some how comes across them again and again but unknown to the thugs she has A black belt in Kung Fu and is she deadly. The film has lots of violence and action also some nudity.,1420848000,,367,4.111111111111111
7989096,5,B000094FFS,"Alley cat is a very good film.
I'd like it better if it were Blu-Ray/but as far as DVDs go.
It's about the best you're ever likely to see.
The DVD is at least anamorphic.
Which is saying more then for the original Studio.
If you're a fan of this film.
Then .Until a Blu-Ray release comes along this DVD is the way to go",1419033600,,319,3.923076923076923

7989099,5,B000094FFS,"I bought this for one reason....and one reason only....Karin Mani nekkid!!!!

How did she not become a huge B movie or other star?  Those nice full lips, slim little waist, beautiful face, and best of all an extremely nice set of huge bazoomas!

Seriously, it's worth it just to see Karin.",1396483200,4,289,4.627450980392157
7989100,5,B000094FFS,and it's been in my head ever since. Finally bought it and it's a fine example of early eighties ridiculous. It's horrible and horribly fun.,1393200000,,140,4.64
7989101,4,B000094FFS,Female revenge films are one of my favorite genre of films and this one from Scorpion Releasing is better than most. Pretty good for a low budget effort.,1386115200,4,153,4.5
7989102,5,B000094FFS,"Under the assumption you are an individual that loves 1980s/1970s exploitation films then you are in luck.  Are films like ""Savage Streets"", ""Ms. 45"", ""Death Wish"" (series) and ""I Spit on Your Grave"" your idea of guilty pleasure entertainment, if so I am pretty certain you will love ""Alley Cat"".  This movie not only is an exploitation revenge film, but it also falls under the umbrella ""so bad it is funny"" realm of movie watching.

The plot is extremely simple; Billie's grandparents are attacked by a ruthless gang.  Then when justice goes astray Billie needs to take the law in her own hands.  It should be noted that Billie is obviously a master in the art of karate so this gang (who is led by an Adam Levine stunt double) better watch out.  There is plenty of cheesy action, gratuitous female nudity, laughable acting and even provides a bit of ""women in prison"" aspects. I would also bet a great deal of money that Karin Mani's (Billie) stunt double is an Asian man.  Oh and don't forget to keep your eyes open for the scene where Billie is dressed just like Rainbow Bright.  Has to be seen to be believed!

I have really enjoyed the DVD treatment that Scorpion Releasing has been producing.  In addition, I love the introductions and closures that Katarina (Leigh Waters) provides.  She is very knowledgeable about the films and appreciates that they are very tongue -in-cheek yet have a place in cinematic history.  As for the picture quality/remastering, I would say it is near perfect, especially considering the age and obscurity of this film.  As for the sound, it is pretty good, however there are times I heard some feedback.  I am not sure if it was the source material or a transfer issue.  It didn't ruin my viewing of this film at all.

This DVD provides a play only or play with Katarina Intro, I prefer the latter.  There are some trailers for other Scorpion Releasing movies as well as the trailer for ""Alley Cat"".  The other bonus is Katarina doing an interview with the producer of ""Alley Cat"".  I have yet to watch this feature, but it runs about thirty minutes long.  I am very pleased I went ahead and grabbed this flick.  It will certainly be viewed again in the future; it is total camp and pretty trashy.  I wish to god they still make movies like this.",1365120000,13,2285,4.5763546798029555
7989103,1,B000094FFS,This is a very poorly made movie the lighting is awful and the script is terrible. If they used proper lighting you could at least watch the movie but as it stands i suggest you save your 10.00 bucks.,1128211200,3,200,4.153846153846154
