1387088,5,B000051SHA,"I have read many accounts of Nikola Tesla, his life's story, inventions, and sad demise of an amazing inventor, visionary, and genius. This PBS documentary is excellent and I recommend it highly to schools to teach the TRUTH, and the true inventor of radio.
This documentary covers from birth to death of Nikola Tesla, and accurately portrays much of what I have read, and even more obscure facts on the man.
The video goes beyond the death of Tesla and explains the everyday appliances around us sprung forth from the inventive mind of this man. His ""death ray"" is also examined and a good discussion of particle beam weaponry follows. Reagan's Star Wars program is also discussed, along with HAARP, the super secret microwave array in a remote part of Alaska.
Tesla was truly a man who knew the secrets of electricity, some of his concepts some are only really beginning to understand. His thoughts on capturing free energy and transmitting it around the world was truly a humanitrian concept and the video explains how he was stopped by greedy capitalists and how he died a penniless man. His work continues to live through us all that are touched by wireless communications, electrical devices Tesla invented, and the fascination with resonance, a key to unlock the very secrets of nature's electric dynamo -  the earth itself.
I only regret this movie lasted only 90 minutes. I wished it had talked about his electric car, although they showed him in the vehicle, they didn't really talk about it.
Get the video, you'll not be disappointed in this fascinating man!

1387089,5,B000051SHA,"This PBS Home Video, about 90 minutes in length, does a wonderful job of conveying the genius that was Nikola Tesla. This is the best and most well balanced video I've seen on the life and accomplishments of America's premier underrated scientist/inventor. Watch this tape and then look around your house. You'll be amazed in the ways in which Tesla impacts our everyday lives. It'a about time that he receives the overdue recognition he so richly deserves.

Truly, it deserves 2 and a half (2.5 stars; maybe) -Poorly researched, this account cant even quote the man correctly.  Nikola was the genius behind everything you are blown away by.  And even the every day mundane stuff we all take for granted.  The man desrves more than this.  Don't watch this and think you know the reality.  Are you a Millennial?

1387105,5,B000051SHA,"So far the best and most credible bio I've come across on Tesla. Though a lot of the fandom and conspiracy theories surrounding this man has been fun to explore.  Loved David Bowie's portrayal of him in The Prestige. He's just a fascinating figure who deserves wider recognition in both history and popular culture.

Aside from all of his technological contributions shown here, I think the most interesting part of this video examines how a good man with good humanitarian visions, who rose from very little on his own, could be swallowed up and forgotten thanks to greedy big business and lesser talents who wanted to (and did) exploit and capitalize on his genius. It's just kind of a sad reality that you can't make it on raw talent alone... you have to possess some cutthroat business/marketing savviness of your own to survive the competition. Tesla failed to protect his commercial interests... in the end, others (Edison, Marconi, Westinghouse, Morgan) exploited him in one way or another.... and/or got very wealthy with his inventions and made lasting names for themselves... and Tesla ended up penniless, rejected, and forgotten.

Why there is so little about him and relationships with women and why he never married is also interesting (he had many germ phobias and obsessions which discouraged such relationships)... though I would have liked to hear more.

Definitely recommended for those interested in learning more about Tesla's life and the evolution of so much modern technology.",1480204800,,1499,5.106122448979592

Does not hide how there is a correlation between the highly gifted and some degree of social dysfunction, which applied to the life of Nikola Tesla. Uninterested in money, but good for the service of all, while pursuing his goal of free energy (not Gibb's free energy) but free power to all, by tapping the energy of the earth, it's magnetic field, his numerous inventions were stepping stones toward his higher goal of utilizing energy to better life for all. His mutual induction motor, to which the patent rights he sold to Westinghouse, revolutionized the distribution of electricity, in alternating current form. He even tore up the patent rights to be paid royalties for every single horsepower produced by AC electricity, which would have amounted to trillions today, if he had not torn it up, in the interest of his company whose leader had ""over-extended"" its means. Tesla was both genius and utilitarian, if only politics and bankers not interfered, but had he the resources he needed at all times, his life's realization could have revolutionized the world, as his ""minor"" inventions had, and still do, which he only saw was less important; the means to his real goal of a better world devoid of war.",1412553600,,1242,4.919047619047619

This was also the first time I ever heard anyone connected with Westinghouse confirm that there was some kind of documentation relating to Tesla's and Westinghouse's agreement regarding royalty payments.

Tesla's personality also makes him lovable through his vulnerability -lack of social abilities- though, it reminds us on how capable, useful & powerful the human mind can be.

They credit Tesla for inventing alternating current power, which is not at all correct.  Tesla was (one of) the inventors of three-phase current.  The whole discussion of HAARP and particle beam weapons was very scatter brained and inaccurate, more like something produced by the History Channel than by PBS.

I think we are still waiting for an excellent professional history of Tesla.  Just as one example, few Tesla fans mention that Tesla did not believe in radio waves, but though signals and energy were being conducted through the Earth as electric current, or conducted through the plasma of the ionosphere.  They also never mention his patent battles with Galileo Farraris.  Although Farraris' patents came before Tesla's, he charmed and convinced a jury that he had a sort of mystical vision of the invention earlier, and was thus ""first to invent"" even though Farraris had been ""first to file"".  Like Edison and Marconi, there is also an historical criticism of Tesla that is absent from the writings of zealous followers.",1391385600,4,1174,4.954081632653061

The rest of the documentary is an overview of his story.  It does have a lot of archival footage and quotes, but it does not get into specifics such as how he originally got funding from JP Morgan, etc.

Some of the documentary is first person with Stacy Keach as the voice of Nikola Tesla. Elisabeth Noone is the narrator.

We learn how his life is intermixed with Mark Twain, William K. Vanderbilt, J.P. Morgan, Westinghouse, Thomas Edison and Guglielmo Marconi.

The actual technical side is held down as it is a Nikola Tesla biography, not a technical how to. On the note you can tell that this documentary is a tad dated as they have a fascination with the strategic defense initiative.

In any event it is good to know more about Tesla and his part in history.

1387471,4,B000051SHA,"I picked up this documentary because I got really interested in Tesla after watching ""The Prestige"" starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.  I suspect I'm one of many that fall into this category.  I mean, I knew who Tesla was prior to seeing the movie, but I realized that outside of the Tesla Coil, I really didn't know much else about the man.  So I took it upon myself to do a little research, I picked up this DVD and picked up a biography by Margaret Cheney (who actually is interviewed on this DVD to my surprise!).  I'm a little over half done the biography as I'm writing this.

Anyway, this documentary was put out by PBS and I've been quite pleased with their documentaries and television shows in the past, so I didn't feel I had anything to worry about in terms of quality.  I was quite correct for the most part.  It's really not a very light hearted documentary and I would say it's even a bit dry at times.  However, the content is very fascinating and tells you all the major things you need to know about this phenomenal inventor.  Basically we would be dealing with a lot of power issues today if it wasn't for Tesla's alternating current.  Usually in the United States (at least while I was in school) everyone talks about Thomas Edison and all his amazing accomplishments, but there are very few who mention Tesla, whom essentially enabled the world TO be lit with Edison's invention.

The documentary takes us from Tesla's humble beginnings in Serbia and his rising interest in engineering during the industrial explosion in the late 1800's.  The documentary goes into detail on all his major accomplishments and some of the controversies he had to deal with.  It touches on the war of the currents between Direct Current and Alternating Current.  It also shows that Marconi for a long time was credited as the inventor of radio, but later it was decided Tesla should technically have that honor.  It also touches on Tesla's first work on robotics with his remote control boat.  From there it goes into his later years when Tesla fell more into himself with little public appearance and would make grandiose public announcements, but none of which came out of them (publicly at least).  I found this last section the most interesting, especially things concerning the lost Tesla papers (which there wasn't much depth on, unfortunately).

The details of all of the above are very fascinating and the documentary is rife with all kinds of photographs of the time.  However, this feels like a general overview of Tesla's life and accomplishments.  It doesn't really delve into the nitty gritty of the situations like you would get in the biography I'm reading.  Though the documentary goes more in chronological order of Tesla's life, which is something I like, because some books seem to be formatted based on his inventions and he invented a lot in the late 1800's, but they never got major recognition until later, so it was nice to see it spelled out for me in terms of a real chronological order.

I would definitely recommend this documentary to anyone who wants a broad overview of Tesla's life.  If you're already well versed in Tesla and his works, this probably isn't what you want to get, because it's very rudimentary in its information.  I thought the documentary could have had a little more to it with such a quirky character.  Tesla's phobias were certainly well known to the community around him!  Unfortunately we are left with strictly an information exchange and it does feel a little dry towards the end.  However, having known somewhat little about Tesla and his fascinating life, I did walk away feeling much more informed and I suppose that is the major point of a documentary.  Personally, I'd recommend it.",1210291200,104,3753,4.75

I watched it with my boyfriend's 10 yr. old daughter (pretty sharp for her age!) who was excited to learn about Tesla's impact on our civilization today & was curious as to why she wasn't learning more about him in school. I'd like to know the answer to that myself! He harnassed the power of Niagara Falls, invented the alternating current giving us the ability to transmit electricity over great distances, gave us the fundamentals of computer and missile science...and had an eccentric, interesting personality to boot. He mingled with the likes of Mark Twain, William K. Vanderbilt, J.P.Morgan, and Thomas Edison. I highly recommend this dvd for anyone who gets excited about amazing inventions (that work), science, the utoptian dream and conspiracy theories!",1208390400,41,1105,4.9144385026737964

1387475,3,B000051SHA,"I really wanted more from this video, speaker's weren't so clear as for an International english movie, scientific documentation, pictures, movie, may be better and, cold and poor Tesla's movie representation. Historical facts were Ok but poorly representated in the video. At near future I will buy other Tesla's videos to get mi opinion wider about this but now I prefer ""The Secrets of Nikola Tesla"".",1120435200,3,403,5.121212121212121

1387477,4,B000051SHA,"This film is a wonderful tribute to a man who has never received the credit he deserved for inventions that we still use and take for granted today.  He was not primarily interested in money or the business side of his inventions and therefore, others whose names you will readily recognize, received credit and a place in history which should have been shared.
My biggest problem with the movie was the irritating heavily-accented voice-overs of Mr. Tesla's diary entries, and quotes by Stacy Keach.  I found it very distracting to have to try to interpret the accent, and would have found it much more entertaining if Mr. Keach would have simply used his normal speaking voice.
Otherwise this film is worth watching and you will be amazed at the genius of Nikola Tesla.",1060387200,5,771,4.7894736842105265

Hugely ripped off by Marconi and Edison (he who denied that alternating current was the future or would even work) and also had US government backing. Many Tesla inventions are taken for granted today and wrongfully attributed to Ed. or Mar. That is shameful.",1501027200,,386,5.142857142857143
