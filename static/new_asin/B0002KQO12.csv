It did not fit him what so ever and he played it very poorly!!! Also,,,bad picture quality, bad story line and the fights were nothing special.  Yeah,,in the end he did a few things,,but like I said nothing special.  I would not recommend this flick what so ever!! I'm gald I only paid $3.89 Canadian!!",1147392000,,454,4.580246913580247
8028441,2,B0002KQO12,"A poorly filmed, poorly produced, poorly transferred, hard to make sense of, and deceptively billed feature.  Gordon Liu, who plays an evil ruler, is given top billing, but appears in no more than 10 minutes of the movie, with barely 4 of those 10 minutes engaged in kung fu.  The title, Raiders of Buddhist Kung Fu, seems to have no bearing at all on what happens in the storyline.  It's apparent that Gordon Liu owed someone a favor, or desparately needed rent money that week. . .

This movie definitely bears the imprint of Godfrey Ho, who directed it.  Fight scenes are not well choreographed, with telegraphed punches and kicks, people beginning to fall before blows are even administered, choppy camera work and see-sawing battles where each party absorbs dozens of lethal blows, but shows no signs of their effect.  Then there's that ""goy-yoy-yoing"" sound that accompanies the really telling blows.  It's not until Gordon Liu fights, in the last few minutes of the movie, that a battle scene takes on any grace or realism--man, the guy was good!  His ultimate demise is (literally) ""for the birds,"" since it is glaringly obvious that the evil Liu is more than the match for the triumphing, good-guy/hero of the film.

The dubbing offers ample comic relief, and in most cases carries the film along through its dry and redundant course.  Most memorable line by Gordon Liu: ""You're all a bunch of idiots!""

The deceptive lure of Gordon Liu's name was the only thing that prompted me to purchase this film.  His four-minute ""cameo"" probably wasn't worth the $3 I paid for the DVD, but at least I got another glimpse--brief as it was--of the inimitable Gordon Liu.",1116374400,5,1668,4.814035087719298
