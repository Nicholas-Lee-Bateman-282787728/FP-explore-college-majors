8404454,5,B003SL61GK,"This DVD was an excellent choice for us.  We are working on silver elements of waltz in our second year of dancing, and are attentive to styling as well as patterns.  These lessons are well organized, clearly presented, and at just the right level for us.  This is a very helpful tool for review, as well as for noticing new details as we progress.  It is well worth the price and will be watched many times.  We will likely purchase more of their CD's for other smooth dances.",1323820800,,477,4.375
