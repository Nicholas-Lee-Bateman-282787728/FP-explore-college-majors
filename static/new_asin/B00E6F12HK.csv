5893472,5,B00E6F12HK,"This is an amazing film about one of the greatest bands I have ever heard. Great interviews, amazing music and an in-depth view into the life of the band members who are extremely gifted but not commercially successful (at least to the point that they should be).  If you enjoy the Gourds, you will love this film.",1381276800,4,314,4.508771929824562
5893473,5,B00E6F12HK,"Great documentary of one of my all time favorite bands. Couldn't have been done any better.
If you're a Gourds fan, it's a must see. If you're not already a Gourds fan, you WILL be after you watch this! I like to use this dvd to convert folks :-)
I've watched it several times, and it never gets old. Five stars all the way. This is the first time I've ever taken the time out to write a review on Amazon, if that tells you anything!",1381276800,7,433,4.046511627906977
5893474,5,B00E6F12HK,"A perfect film to celebrate and get to know each of the members of The Gourds--essential for those who love their music and a great introduction to hook those unfortunate folks who do not yet know about them.

I was fortunate to have received an advance dvd copy of the film and have watched it three times on three consecutive days.  The film conveys the energy of their performances, the skill and passion of each member--Jimmy Smith, Keith Langford, Max Johnston, Claude Bernard and Kev Russell.  Kev Russell and Jimmy Smith write most of their songs.  You get a real sense of their stylistic differences and how they ultimately complement each other so effectively.  But what I really liked was the filmmakers' emphasis on how the combined contributions of every member form the unique sound and soul of The Gourds.

All the Labor evokes the essence of the title of their most recent album, Old Mad Joy.  There is joy and humor throughout.  The funniest moment is the surprise about Kev and his liking of grilled fish.  And their love and respect for each other shines through every frame of the film.  Watching this great film is a wonderful way to rejoice about a unique band that should be more recognized.

Set for release in November, All the Labor would be a great Christmas present for any Gourds fan or anyone who loves pure American music.  Get a bunch of copies for your friends.  And then get out and see them whenever you're lucky enough to do so.",1377388800,6,1463,4.624031007751938

8602040,5,B00E6F12HK,"I'm sure this film doesn't capture everything that is The Gourds, but it took me back to the first time I listened to Gogitchyershinebox as a teenager on the way back from Hastings with my best friend. The Gourds' music has accompanied me on road trips, through breakups, in many of my own performances, and the odd drunk afternoon. If you ever had great moment listening to these dudes, you should get this",1399075200,4,407,4.589041095890411
8602041,5,B00E6F12HK,I love this band and the live shows were awesome. I certainly hate that they disbanded. They will be sorely missed. This DVD is awesome I totally enjoyed it.  I wish that this DVD had come out like years ago so maybe The Gourds could have had hits on the radio.,1396828800,2,261,4.117647058823529
8602042,5,B00E6F12HK,"The Gourds, despite releasing 11 albums and touring constantly have somehow managed to remain largely unheard of and unappreciated by mainstream listeners and the media. Their music is an eclectic mix played by a rag-tag and loveable bunch of rogues who are unpretentious and inspiring. This dvd will serve as both an introduction to the uninitiated and a welcome addition to the collection of devotees. 5 strs and 10 out of 10.",1394928000,4,428,4.958333333333333
8602043,4,B00E6F12HK,I think the documentary is a must for Gourds' fans... only wished there was more footage of the early days.,1394582400,,107,4.4
8602044,5,B00E6F12HK,"I've been listening to the Gourds for as long as I can remember, kind of like when you figure out you've been married to your wife for 10 years, feels like it's been a lot longer than that. This is a band I will always love just hopeful I will get to see them all together again some day. I don't know what happened but I hope it comes back together. This DVD is the best ever and I have a feeling it will be one of those I watch over and over again. It's a must have for any Gourd fan. If you're not a fan and you've heard them, I'm sorry, you'll never get it.",1389312000,,561,3.8034188034188032
8602045,5,B00E6F12HK,"A wonderfully crafted documentary about a skilled and passionate group of musicians who work incredibly hard. Life on the road, interactions between the members, and awesome performances are all in this film. Highly recommended.",1381276800,4,228,5.735294117647059
