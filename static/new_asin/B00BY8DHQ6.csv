5681835,3,B00BY8DHQ6,"The English Teacher had all the early indicators of a breakthrough storyline for the floundering key protagonists who had found fresh inspiration based on a play written by a former student. However, the narrative lost its momentum as it grappled with characters on the verge of completely stepping out of their comfort zones only to turn back shortly later. As a result juicy plot development fizzled leading to predictable events. The cast were an excellent group and their contribution helped offset some of the shortcomings of the film.

5681850,4,B00BY8DHQ6,"The English Teacher surprises with a charm all it's own.  I didn't know what to expect -- it surprises in many ways.  The beginning of the story is predictable, a lonely woman looking for companionship through online dating, while teaching English literature.  She runs into a former student, a failed writer, and takes him under her wing--after pepper spraying him by mistake.  The movie is full of little surprises like this, and rocks along with several more unexpected turns.

At times I was embarrassed, but thought the English teacher's innate honesty, and, bravery in facing a difficult situation both admirable and honest.  She's made a terrible mistake, but redeems herself.

I watched this movie as research for an article that I'm writing for a newspaper, and this is simply one of the worst movies that I've ever seen-  Yes, it's truly that bad.  The actors and actresses are all clearly very talented, but not even this cast can salvage a script which is this poorly written-  and the saddest part is that the basic idea behind the story line isn't bad at all, it actually had potential.  The characters are mostly stereotypes, the characters so overly-stereotyped that the movie very quickly takes on a cartoon-esque quality, in fact cartoons are easier to take seriously than this movie.  As a romantic comedy, on a scale of 1 to 10 I'll rate this one a zero (0), it's neither romantic nor funny, just trite simplistic garbage.  The best thing that I can say about this movie is that fortunately, amazon will give me 25 trade- in value for my used dvd copy, which is really all this is worth.",1399852800,,943,4.47953216374269

5681859,4,B00BY8DHQ6,"Julianne Moore gives a memorable performance as Linda Sinclair, a stodgily cool, attractively nerdy high school English teacher who finds herself in a compromising position with a talented former student whose play she's promoting  to the school's administration and Thespians. While I loled once or twice, most of the consistent humor is of a drier, more satirical variety. This film does a nice job of compassionately satirizing a number of institutions and stereotypes, and this is one English teacher that really knows how to keep at least some of the class's attention without asking them to think too hard.

Notwithstanding the mock Masterpiece Theater narrator, THE ENGLISH TEACHER is quite light comedy in the end, without a lot of character depth or conflict development. Though it's pretty tame stuff and looks like it could be rather uneventful, plenty happens throughout its short (90-minute) length.

Not to sound snooty, elitist, or anything else, but it seems that someone would need one and preferably both of the following in order to really enjoy THE ENGLISH TEACHER:

A) Some familiarity with the world of Secondary Education, its various workplace clichs (""Just take it down one level, please,"" etc), and sensitive legalities--admin's concern about the possibility of a lawsuit if they allow the students to put on a play that ends in bloody murder, etc.

B) Some familiarity with (and interest in?) classic American and British literature. While the frequent allusions are nothing heavy, it helps to know a little about who Lord Byron was, the basic plot of Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN, and so forth.

I strongly recommend this film to anyone who falls under those categories, particularly those who teach English. Some current high school students (and parents) with relatively sedate tastes may also like it. Those outside these perimeters may be rather bored by THE ENGLISH TEACHER.

Nothing really wild happens beyond some implied sex, a lot of realistic profanity, and generally sensitive subject matter.",1397260800,,2029,5.243827160493828
5681860,4,B00BY8DHQ6,I really enjoyed this movie.  It was in a magazine and it highly recommended it.  I finally got to see it and it's fabulous.  A must.,1395360000,,133,4.038461538461538
5681861,5,B00BY8DHQ6,"I personally have been a fan of Julianne Moore since ""Nine Months"" In this, she plays not only a proper and disciplined English high school teacher, but literary heroine to a former student who cannot get his play, ""The Chrysalis"" produced in New York.  Flanked by a wonderful cast of young students and her co-partner in bringing the play to life on a high school stage, and Drama teacher Carl Kapanis, played by Nathan Lane in his classic comedic form.  If you enjoyed ""Little Miss Sunshine"", then the added appeal of Greg Kinnear as the student's father is very good.  I found nothing offensive in this film.  it is a comedy, and sadly, with the kinds of devices our newest generation is growing up on, these things can and do happen.  It was also a prize to see an independent film give the audience so much rather than hearing it cost 200 million to produce another - that's a lesson ""The English Teacher"" can give to all of us.  Recommended 14+",1393891200,,950,4.526315789473684
5681862,4,B00BY8DHQ6,"Not surprisingly, ""The English Teacher""is about a high-school English teacher (Julianne Moore), a forty-something unmarried woman who is totally devoted to her work. Due to a chance meeting at an ATM one evening, she encounters a former student who's barely half her age and whom she recognizes only after she sprays pepper spray in his face. This is one of the funnier moments of the movie. However, the movie takes a somewhat more serious tone when the English teacher becomes committed to the play that her former student (an aspiring playwright) has written and spearheads a crusade to use it for the semi-annual high school production.

From this point on the movie takes us through a series of misadventures, in which she and her former student have a brief but decidedly unromantic sexual encounter in her classroom, her ex-student and the lead character in the play become romantically involved, and her brief liaison becomes public knowledge. All this takes place against the background of an attempt on the part of the school administration to change the ending of the play, because as written it is too ""dark"" for a high-school production.

In the end all of the main characters come across as being flawed people, driven by their particular agendas. As a result, it is hard to identify a character who is truly likable (or for that matter, truly unlikable). Moreover, despite the conflict that arises from these conflicting agendas and all the hurt feelings that result, somehow everything gets neatly and quickly tied up at the end and everyone is living happily ever after.

If you treat it for what it isa fairly lighthearted movie that isn't quite realistic""The English Teacher"" will provide you with an hour and a half of decent entertainment.",1393027200,,1760,4.979591836734694

5681873,5,B00BY8DHQ6,"How did I miss this movie?  I was at the library the other day and I noticed it on the shelf, read the synopsis on the back, and who was in the cast, and I brought it home.  Today I watched it and was completely taken in!

The story is about an unmarried high school English teacher who is very passionate about her job so much so that even in her spare time she is surrounded by books and novels of writers and even her social life is wrapped up in the lives of the people in books.  Enter a former student, Jason, a recent graduate of NYU who has written a play that no one wants to not only read but perform.  Eager to help, Linda(played by Julianne Moore) persuades the administration to put on the play using high school students.  The drama teacher, Carl, kind of a flamboyant guy who didn't quite make it as an actor, is only too enthusiastic.  Nathan Lane is cast as Carl and excels in the part as he goes about making this production into something that Broadway would envy---it's even more evident as the costs mount up!  By the way Linda is footing the bill!

Things start to go haywire when there is some romantic and sexual feelings happening on the set that involve Linda, the leading lady, and Jason.  Then to throw the wrench in all of this is Jason's dad,  played by Greg Kinnear, a successful doctor who thinks his son should have a more worthwhile career.  There is a lot of miscommunication, Linda's reputation is at stake, and a minor accident causes all this to come to a head.  Will the play go on in it's original form?  Will Linda keep her job?  Is Jason's dad the tyrant he is made out to be?

All the roles in this movie were very well played.  I wasn't familiar with Michael Angarano who played Jason but he really captured the raw emotions of someone trying to write, becoming emotionally involved with not only producing his play but with the players and also getting along with his dad.  Julianne Moore as Linda is a very vulnerable woman who has spent so much time in the literary world that she has lost touch with how the real world works and that the people in it are not always as they seem.",1386460800,5,2127,4.301507537688442

5681881,3,B00BY8DHQ6,"Though certainly not a unique approach to films there is a certain uniqueness about this fun tale.

Linda Sinclaire (Julianne Moore) is a single, 45 year old English teacher in a small Pennsylvania town who is past a time she feels qualifies her for marriage. She runs into a former student, Jason Sherwood (Michael Angarano) who is a failed play write back from New York. She reads his play. Loves it and wants to produce it with the high school drama club. After some himming and hawing he agrees and the resulting trip prove problematic for all involved.

This is no great shakes. It's just a good time. The directing is meat and potatoes, but the story holds a few surprises. Certain things I thought would happen in the third act show up in the second so it had me guessing as to how this mess was going to work itself out. And you have a cadre of good actors holding things together. Julianne Moore might not have been the best choice as Sinclaire because it's simply too difficult to hide her beauty and sexuality. Michael Angarano is a likable kind of guy in all his flicks and he's no less so here. Greg Kinnear, likewise, is very likable. He does a decent job here but he could have used more screen time. Nathan Lane is made for this kind of role and he fits nicely. The writing is decent and I liked the wa the sticky situation worked itself out. It wasn't too pat. The music was light and airy. Befitting to the content.

This isn't five star cuisine. It's more like a trip to Joe's steakhouse. When you're done you're done but the ride was worth the fair. Just sit back and enjoy.",1383868800,2,1594,4.396610169491526

5681888,2,B00BY8DHQ6,"THE ENGLISH TEACHER begins with a pleasant, British woman's voice narrating the back story of our lead character, an English teacher/spinster named Linda who has lived most of her life in books. The narrator describes Linda and her life in cutesy, tongue-in-cheek terms. I'm not really a fan of voice-overs -- they're one of the laziest elements that a scriptwriter can use -- but I figured this was an attempt to place the film along the border of a fantasy genre, to prepare the audience for a story that was meant mostly as a fable.

What happens is that Linda, one night, meets up with an old student (Jason) who has been trying to become a playwright, but whose senior project has been rejected by every company he's sent it to. Linda offers to read the play, is touched deeply, and decides to put the production on at her high school. From here, she encounters staff members who are worried by the play's dark undertones, a director who can't stop spending her money, horny actresses, Jason's seemingly unsupportive father (Greg Kinnear being Greg Kinnear), as well as a -- whoops! -- sexual indiscretion with the playwright himself.

In a movie where a disembodied British woman is narrating much of the action, it's important for the comedy to be in both the characters as well as the events, and unfortunately almost no one in this movie is either interesting or likeable, let alone both. Nathan Lane's director is the most enjoyable person to watch, but he disappears three-quarters of the way through in an awkwardly obvious plot contrivance that the movie doesn't even bother to apologize for (don't worry; he just as inexplicably reappears to take his part in the grand finale). Nearly every character seems to switch personalities multiple times and for very little reason at all. Jason, especially, is a pretty annoying guy, and although you only get to see/hear glints of his supposedly powerful play, none of those glimpses appear to belong to something especially unique or touching.

I know that the film is meant to be a lighthearted throwaway -- all for fun, some might say -- but the characters and plotting are so schizophrenic that it feels like it's trying to be three different kinds of funny and cute at the same time, and the effect is jarring and overdone. I was going to give the film three stars until the penultimate scene, when Jason's play is finally performed and viewers are treated to their largest sample of the play, yet: the ending. It is composed of pretty much every hackneyed, trite, Hallmark-level cliche that you'll find in comedy romances, but the film treats it as if it is an overwhelming breakthrough for both the characters and the audience. At a moment where comedy would've been most appropriate, the movie goes for sincerity, and in the goopiest, schmaltziest way possible. It's like a cake that's 80% frosting. Sure, we all love frosting, but eat too much of it and you get sick. There should also be substance there, and this film pretty much has none. If you've got the stomach for the overly-sweet, you might like the film, but I ended it with a belly ache.",1379894400,2,3114,4.762962962962963
5681889,3,B00BY8DHQ6,"And those who can't teach, teach gym.  That's from Woody Allen, and maybe it's too bad that he didn't direct this movie.  It's a send-up of Middle-American morality, but it never succeeds in becoming anything more than a pleasant little film.

I invoked the overused cliche for my review title because that's the well from which this little drama springs.  It is the thwarted desires of the English teacher (Julianne Moore) and the drama teacher (Nathan Lane) which drive them to produce the corny, but mildly promising script by the former student (and spoiled brat) played by Michael Angarano.  The play in question is called ""The Chrysalis"", which in itself is kind of a corny metaphor for high school.... the place which is supposed to incubate successes (and largely produces failures).  Michael Angarano's ""Jason"" appeals to the deeply ingrained sense of inferiority in his former teachers... and at one point, he honestly reveals his contempt for them, to Moore's character.  By that point, Moore's English teacher is experiencing an unrelenting fall from grace largely because of Jason's manipulations.

Moore and Lane are basically what makes this film watchable, and Moore in particular.  She is excellent in her comedic portrayal of a repressed (but still attractive) middle-aged woman who is a victim of her own politically correct nature.  In fact Moore is so good, she will probably remind you of at least one person that you know.

This movie reminded me of both ""Waiting For Guffman"" and ""Election"" in its close to the bone portrayals of small town personalities, and high school viciousness.  But it never rises to the level of ""Guffman"", which is absolutely hilarious.  ""The English Teacher"" is a film, like its subject, that remains trapped by its own primness and lack of ambitions.",1379894400,,1802,5.067796610169491

5681892,4,B00BY8DHQ6,"It's not really as sordid as it seems. But you have to watch it past the awkward parts, mostly the first third or so? The ending is a nice touch, and is actually very original in how it's presented. At first I thought it was rather tasteless, and making everyone look horrible, but later it makes more sense; maybe none of them really knew how to respect and value themselves, and that's what caused the trouble in the first place. If you can stick it out through the grimaces, and some genuine laughs, in the end you will feel better about everybody involved. Certainly better evening entertainment than your average blockbuster fodder.

p.s. There seems to be a polarizing aspect to this film, drawing strong reactions from reviewers. I suspect it has to do with the sex, which, although limited to one scene and presenting no actual nudity, goes against certain social mores. It also presents its characters' flaws in a way that can be cringe-worthy at times. Again, I almost didn't watch it to the end, but was glad I did. Themes many seemed to have missed are transformation and new endings: Is it possible to write a new ending to your life, no matter how habitual and constricting it may have become? Can you just walk out of a life story that doesn't fit you anymore, and never look back? Given these subtexts, the ex-student's play title, ""Chrysalis,"" is more a hint at the messages in The English Teacher than about the play itself.",1379116800,2,1442,4.6328125
5681893,2,B00BY8DHQ6,"Julianne Moore, as usual, acted very well in this movie. Just found the story could have been more rounded and the characters were really shallow. There wasn't any growth from the characters except for somewhat with Julianne's character. I wouldn't advise this one.

5681895,5,B00BY8DHQ6,"Julianne Moore does a splendid job portraying the spinster English teacher. Which is kind of hard to believe that she'd ever be one. I mean, c'mon, it's Julianne Moore. Anyway, the subject is serious and there are some touching scenes but it manages to keep the tone light and comical throughout the film. And Nathan Lane is always great!",1378684800,4,338,4.745762711864407
5681896,2,B00BY8DHQ6,"We all fall into the trap of picking movies inhabited by our favorite actors. Julianne Moore (The Big Lebowski, The Kids Are Alright, Children of Men) is a favorite of mine, and so when the English Teacher made its debut it became first in my movie queue. What a mistake. The movie's plot and script are trite, predictable, and uni-dimensional and its A-lister roster which include Broadway thespian Nathan Lane (The Birdcage) and always funnyman(although not so here) Greg Kinnear (Little Miss Sunshine, As Good As It Gets) and Michael Angarano (Almost Famous, Red State, The Forbidden Kingdom)can do nothing to save this 93-minute yawn fest. The story revolves around a dedicated but dull English teacher who, unlucky in love, throws her passion into the development of her students' lives (thought this cliche about English teachers ended with Diane Keeton's Looking for Mr. Goodbar).  When former student Angarano reunites with her at an ATM, Moore mistakes him for a mugger and subdues him with blasts of pepper spray. She learns that lIfe (on off Broadway) has been unkind to him and that he returns to the embrace of his small town with unpublished script in hand.  In her e finds an ever faithful cheerleader who champions his talent and doesn't resist his sexual advances which result in classroom seduction (where else, but on the school marm's desk).  Of course her straight laced feathers are ruffled (and titillated), and it isn't exactly non self-interest that causes her to take this floundering student under her wing.  She talks the high school powers that be into producing his play and the movie fun is supposed to begin, but merely takes a nose dive going forward. The plot would not have been so bad if the characters hadn't been scripted so poorly. Moore as the mousy English teacher, Kinnear as a controlling father (he wants his son to drop the whole Broadway thing and just go to law school), Lane as the artsy but failed drama teacher (Lane plays to type), and Angarano as the misunderstood student/author might all go down a bit easier with a big bowl of popcorn and a brew. Skip this one!",1378598400,2,2116,4.837016574585635
5681897,5,B00BY8DHQ6,Good story line. Excellent acting. Just happened to find it. Never heard of it before but I was pleasantly surprised.,1378252800,,117,4.9
5681901,3,B00BY8DHQ6,"""The true romantic is always alone and must ever be on guard against a dangerous world."" Linda (Moore) is an unmarried English teacher with a passion for teaching her students, when Jason (Angarano) a former student of hers shows up and fills her in on his life. After graduating from NYU he has become a failed playwright and his overbearing father is forcing him to go to law school. After reading one of his plays Linda talks the school into producing it which causes tension between him, his father, and the school as well as bizarre love situations. Based on the cast alone I was very much looking forward to seeing this. Greg Kinnear is one of my favorite actors and Julianne Moore is great in everything. The idea didn't seem all that original or exciting but the acting more then makes up for it. It seems like every movie made about a teacher involves an English teacher and most of the time they are very good. This is really a toned down, less classic version of Dead Poet's Society in the way that the teacher tries to help a student realize his potential against the wishes of his father and the school. I am in no way comparing this to Dead Poet's Society but it is worth watching and I did enjoy it. Overall, great acting and funny, very much worth watching. I give it a B.",1378080000,3,1288,4.415966386554622
5681902,4,B00BY8DHQ6,"I agree with you that the characters in THE ENGLISH TEACHER got it backwards by overlooking a 25-year-old playwright making out with an ""underage"" high school student, and condemning a ""legal"" 40-year-old English teacher doing the same thing with the playwright.  But, wasn't that the point of the movie?  To show you how things are not always what they appear.  At that point in the movie, almost everyone thought the English teacher was a horrible person and the playwright was an angel.  Why?  Because she made out with her former student, who she also lied to about the ending of his play.  But then we later find out that the playwright/former student isn't so wonderful after all.  He took the easy way out for the ending of his play as he did in his real life.  He lied to his father about going to law school.  And he made out with an underage student.  All very immature and childish behavior.  Suddenly, the tables are turned around and by the time we get to the end of the movie--we have a little bit more respect and compassion for the English teacher.  Yes, maybe she didn't handle the whole play production very well--but at least she tried and did the best that she could.  And somehow she realized that's what the playwright's father tried to do too.  And the playwright--well, he just comes across as a problem child.  IMO viewers should not see THE ENGLISH TEACHER about a teacher and her former student.  They should see it as a film about PARENTING because that's what the English teacher and playwright's father were trying to do.  Who said there wasn't character development in this film?!",1377907200,2,1611,4.656028368794326
5681903,4,B00BY8DHQ6,"Alas an aging maidenly English teacher breaks out of her routine when she falls for a much younger former student. Hollywood has produced many variations of the inappropriate teacher/student theme, but this film stars Julianne Moore which adds a touch of grace and class to the role of English Teacher. Also Nathan Lane helps to push the comedy along. This movie nicely answers the  question of couples sitting home on a Saturday night, ""I dunno; What do you want to watch?",1377907200,,473,4.839506172839506
5681904,1,B00BY8DHQ6,This movie had great actors but gave us a message that was absolutely despicable. A 25 year something play writer propositioning an underage student without any ramification or moral comment is reprehensible.  I wish I could use stronger language but what the hell is going on.  We can't let things like this be normal.  We keep projecting a careless attitude towards appalling behavior not to mention it's illegal. Yet we think the worst is that the 25 year old did it with the 40 year old teacher. Geez we can't get more backward. There was absolutely no point in this movie. It was disgusting and had no comedic value at all.  The women were projected as weak stupid idiots. I will be boycotting Hollywood even more.  They cannot get their acts together.  I am deleting this movie and I am sorry I bought it. I was disgusted by the content and so should others. I have a daughter and a 4yr. old granddaughter and all I can see this movie doing is endangering their future. I am sorry that the actors chose to be a part of this project. I won't be jumping in to see their movies that fast in the future. The people that gave this movie a good rating should reconsider their tastes for the foul.  IT IS A WORTHLESS OFFENSIVE MOVIE!,1377648000,7,1232,4.448888888888889
5681905,4,B00BY8DHQ6,"When you look at the cast for this film - a movie that I don't even remember playing in theaters - you'll wonder why you never heard of it before. (I sure did!). Julianne Moore and Nathan Lane are just two of the names and you can add Greg Kinnear (""As Good as It Gets"""")  Nikki Blonsky (Hairspray) to the list. As you will find out on unusually long 27-minute ""Making Of"" Featurette (which features interviews with much of the cast and excepts from rehearsals - rather than the usual clips from the film you just saw) this was a really low-budget ""independent"" film which was made from start to finish in under a year. It was filmed in New York City and the nearby Hudson Valley (subbing for a fictitious town in Pennsylvania) which allowed it to get both Broadway acting talent and Broadway set designers (essential for the ""play within a play"" which is one of the fun parts of this 93-minute film.

But I haven't even told you about the plot (and maybe this is the first review here that you are reading). We'll, if you've read my other reviews on Amazon, you know that I'm not a fan of ""spoilers"" and this is another film that the less you know about before you watch it, the better. So I'll suggest that you limit yourself  - for now - to short reviews. What I will tell you is that it is the story of local playwright whpo goes to New York where his play is rejected. He comes home and finds that his former ""English Teacher"" would like to have his premiere at the local high school. ThaT'S IT. That's all I'm going to tell you of the plot. If you like theater or if you have an interest in drama departments in high schools, I can recommend it even more. The twists and turns will bne better enjoyed if you don't know much more.

In addition to the ""making of"" featurette I mentioned earlier, there is one deleted scene (which really isn't important and I'm glad it was deleted) and the Theatrical trailer. I'm told the same features appear on both the DVD and Bluray.
I gave the film four stars - though it might go up to 4.5 - because there are a few story lines that are left hanging. To tell you more would give away too much. This film was obviously made with great love by folks who care. It's listed as a comedy though there is not much to laugh out loud at. I'd prefer to call it a light drama.

The film is being released by Cinedigm as part of their Tribeca Film Festival catalog.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Nathan Lane's character is the same one he plays in everything - with the exception of ""The Good Wife"" where he was excellent.

How this miserable, hillbilly saga got off the ground is a testimony to Hollywood's conviction that America is a sick, soiled society.

This is not a film that pretends to answer the big questions about ""why we are here"" or ""how to save the world"" nor does the film pass judgment on choices made. Instead, The English Teacher focuses on the small realities of how we create and contend with the messes in our individual lives as we careen along dealing with relationships and work, and how those choices we make effect everyone from those we have little interaction with to the people we care about the most. The English Teacher references a few pieces of great literature and many of the great writers of modern times while never forgetting that a 90 minute romantic comedy could be easily sank with such weighty themes. The film bounces along perhaps a bit predictably through a few mud and muck filled pot holes to an ending that we all wish we could arrive at after committing mistakes both small and catastrophic. The wonderful cast of staggeringly talented actors teeter on the brink of the absurd but in the end it is their collective giving in to the premise while playing right to the limit of believability that makes it all work,  The English Teacher is a beautiful drive down a favorite country road, one we look forward to taking again.",1477872000,,1319,4.636752136752137

The characters are likable and fairly believable, with the exception of an exaggeratedly boorish assistant principal (at least that's what I think his position is; it's never clearly stated) and to some extent the young girl who has the lead in the school play. She starts out as a very pretty, 'sensitive"" girl and then morphs into a  spiteful and cruel (with some justification) creature. The transition is jarring, considering the light-hearted atmosphere. But not to worry; she turns nice again at the end!
The ending, with the playwright (well-played by Angarano) finally feeling validated, is affecting. On the whole, well directed, acted, and filmed. The story is somewhat fantastical, a bit like one of Shakespeare's comedies. Not to be taken as a serious commentary on high-school relationships!
