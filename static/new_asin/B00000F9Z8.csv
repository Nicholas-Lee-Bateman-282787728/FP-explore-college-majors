While We were growing up he always wanted to be the best.

The Perfect Ride shows that he is.

Wade will always have that ride to remember and pass down thru our family.

Some of the family is still looking for copies so if you have a used one to sell please put it up on amazon. We will buy it.

This video shows how hard bull riding is and how truly amazing Wade's PERFECT ride really was. This also shows the dangers involved if you are not aware of the skill involved.

I recommend this for all Rodeo lovers. It will always be a great memory.",1112227200,,586,4.008620689655173
7907608,3,B00000F9Z8,"This video really threw me...I sat and watched it with my nine year old son who loves rodeo.  We were swaying with the music and the twists of the bulls.
This video entertains you with some clips of youngsters riding steer, a bit of bull and rider history, and some real swinging rides. The narrating is done by a professional announcer and a stock breeder.  They give you some extra insight on the bulls and the riders.
The main thing that threw me was that it all ended so soon.  I was pumped up and strapped in for more...but when a good ride lasts for eight seconds it would take quite a few rides to make a full length feature film.
This is not a full length type film, but it is very informative and entertaining, you can witness the PERFECT RIDE...",980121600,2,755,4.302816901408451
