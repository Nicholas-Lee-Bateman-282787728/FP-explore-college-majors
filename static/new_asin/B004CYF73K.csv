4330029,2,B004CYF73K,Very poorly done. Interviewer was ill prepared. Cast members were disinterested. Matt LeBlanc stared at his shoes the whole time.,1405641600,2,129,5.5
4330030,2,B004CYF73K,Not that interesting. Only  three cast members  were  there.  .It was made in the  early days of the show so not much  insight into the show.....all in all pretty boring!,1404432000,,170,4.5
4330031,3,B004CYF73K,"Disappointed that the actors who play Monica, Ross and Phoebe were unable to attend. Although one of the writers/producers tended to dominate the conversation it was overall worth watching.",1393113600,3,189,5.551724137931035
4330032,4,B004CYF73K,"I love that the Paleyfest panels are available on Prime. If you like TV and are looking for something to have on in the background that you don't have to pay close attention to visually, these are perfect.  A great way to find out the inside scoop on how your favorite characters came to be and what the process is for getting the show from the writer's room to your TV set.",1388534400,,374,4.194444444444445
4330033,5,B004CYF73K,"At 62, I still love this show, try never to miss the re-runs.  what can I say, still love Joey!! How a u doing!!!!!!!",1379030400,,117,3.875
4330034,4,B004CYF73K,"That tongue-in-cheek statement above was made by Matthew Perry during the cast of FRIENDS' time in the sun at Paleyfest, and it's only one of the funny comments he drops on that day, on October 4, 1996. This live onstage panel discussion took place when FRIENDS, in terms of name branding and universal popularity, was in its white hot phase, going into the show's third season. Half the cast showed up for this one: Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, as well as creators/executive producers David Crane and Marta Kauffman, executive producers Kevin Bright and Michael Borkow, producer Alexa Junge, and writers Jeff Astrof and Mike Sikowitz. We are informed that Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, and David Schwimmer had prior commitments. I'm trying to accept that with grace.

It's a no frills DVD, and yet it gives us what we want, full and uncut. Things kick off with the playful onstage panel chit chat already underway with Robert M. Batscha, President of the Museum of Television & Radio (which later became the Paley Center for Media), acting as moderator. Batscha conducts a lively but brief interview with the cast & crew. Almost eight minutes into the DVD, he turns the Q & A session over to the audience, and the fans' interactions with the panel make up the rest of the show.

All in all, the program - what's captured on film, anyway - runs 46 minutes long and reinforces Matthew Perry's rep as a naturally funny guy. Fifteen years later and especially if you've bent an ear to the audio commentaries on various FRIENDS complete Season DVD collections (I'd recognize Marta Kauffman's chortle anywhere), there's not much that you won't already know about FRIENDS. But this 1996 cup of nostalgia still goes down nice. Familiar topics are covered - you've heard them all before - such as the genesis of the show and where the actors were in their career at the time they were hired (Perry mentions the pilot he'd shot just prior featuring the premise of baggage handlers in the year 2194). Questions are raised about the show's overnight success, the cast's chemistry, the whole Ross and Rachel thing, and, of course, the Rachel hairdo. As someone who considers FRIENDS his favorite sitcom series ever, I was pretty happy with this product, even with only half the cast. Along with some insight, the elements that we've come to associate with FRIENDS are present: the good rapport, the double takes, the easy banter. In this panel, the producers weigh in as much as the actors. Maybe my favorite insert-foot-in-mouth remark comes from creator/exec. producer Marta Kauffman who presents an example of an actor unexpectedly altering the dynamics of a role. She says: ""Joey was very different before Matt came along. He, uh, he was... smart."" And then watch as Kauffman goes on to nicely dig herself out of that hole.",1325721600,8,2830,4.869294605809128

4330071,3,B004CYF73K,"Was more of the writers talking. Matt LeBlanc really didn't have much to say. Matthew Perry was pretty funny. Jennifer Aniston was her cute self. David Schwimmer, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow had previous engagements.",1426636800,,218,5.257142857142857

4330073,2,B004CYF73K,"I really wanted to like this because Friends was such a well written show, and one of my personal favorites, but the interview was not very well constructed. First off, only half the cast was present, and I understand the other three were busy with previous engagements, but the actors present did not even seem to want to be there. It was awkward watching Aniston answer questions so dismissively, and her prolonged bragging about how hard the show creators had to try to hire her in the first place was a little painful.
As a Friends fanatic it was pretty insulting that the actors as a whole seemed so distracted and uninterested. Overall, I was expecting much more and was looking forward into getting a glimpse of what the actors are like out of character, but this was very disheartening to watch.",1422662400,3,803,4.661971830985915
4330074,4,B004CYF73K,"Fun watching all the creative, intelligent, fun folks involved with this iconic series.  I was a little disappointed the entire acting cast wasn't present.",1415923200,,155,5.458333333333333

8423833,2,B004CYF73K,"It's annoying that is starts in the middle of the session and not at the beginning. 1996 was the height of ""Friends"" mania so it's interesting to hear from the young Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry. Perry is naturally charming and does most of the talking for the cast (he was also asked the most questions), Jen is adorable, and LeBlanc kinda seems like he wishes he was somewhere else. The behind the scenes scoop from the creators, producers, and writers was cool. I liked hearing about the day-to-day breakdown of making an episode. Not the best but good to see once! A true ""Friends"" fan will appreciate it.",1467072000,,630,4.684684684684685

8423839,2,B004CYF73K,"It was interesting to see the stars, but the content was disappointing.  A mic was too close to one person who laughed loud and long, interrupting the flow, and the subjects did not cover any of the questions I would have asked.  The overall effect was raucous.  The cast/crew were having more fun than the audience.  I gave up after 10-15 minutes.

James Lipton, where are you when we need you!",1427760000,,395,4.507042253521127
