2561612,2,B000FDE5U8,"Mee-Shee is a movie that lacks any real punch, but is basically entertaining enough for young children.  Unfortunately, some out of place foul language create an unpleasant situation that many parents might well choose to avoid.

The film follows the discovery and subsequent interations with a loch ness monster type of animal by a 9 year old boy and those close to him.  There is some action and the film makers did a decent job of making the ""monster"" cute and likeable.  Most small children will find this film entertaining without being too scary.  This film is NOT geared for adults, who will probably find it overly simplistic.

A couple of things might discourage parents from showing this to their children.  First, the language is not sexual or overly profane, but several words that are used repeatedly are the type of words that most parents wouldn't want their kids saying or hearing.  Second, the boy's father intentionally and with a smile destroys some equipment belonging to an oil company (the company had done nothing wrong in this film) and the incident is looked upon with smiles by the boy and all of his friends.  The moral of that scene is that all oil companies are bad and that it is OK to destroy their equipment without cause, even if they pay your salary (the boy's dad was employed by this oil company).

While the movie was close to decent, parents concerned about moral issues and foul language should not feel like their children will really miss anything by avoiding this film",1154390400,8,1510,4.75095785440613

2561618,3,B000FDE5U8,"Maybe children won't be aware how boring Mee-Shee: The Water Giant is, but I certainly was!  The first half of the movie is basically total nothingness about a boy and his father taking a trip to Canada and the boy meeting up with an Indian girl around his age and finding out there's a huge, mysterious monster in the water.

There's no adventure, mystery or excitement for the first 30 minutes- just boredom.  Perhaps when I say ""nothingness"" it's actually an example of such a predictably written story that I've seen a thousand times, that someone who HASN'T been exposed to this kind of storytelling would think of it in a more positive light.

I thought the actual water giant was a really big exaggeration but again, perhaps your kids wouldn't notice since they're so young and usually can't notice or pick apart such mediocrity.  Overall, it's not a terrible film but I find that the weak storyline really hurts it.",1335225600,2,923,4.708074534161491

2561621,5,B000FDE5U8,"We had never heard of this movie before about a month ago. On a boring TV Saturday afternoon I thought ""Why not?"" and flipped it over. This movie was incredible!!!! The ""Creature"" and story were wonderful. We fell in love with the whole package. It was so great to find that it was available on DVD at Amazon, so I sent for it immediately. I've recommended it to many people since, and have even shown it to a few. They've all loved it!! It is truly a real family movie which one just can not hardly find any more. If you have small children, older family members that are fussy about language and the like you don't have to be afraid of showing this one to them. Get it, get some snackies, and sit back and enjoy. OH YEAH, it is not a HORROR movie!!!!!!! Oh one more thing---there is a great surprise at the end!!",1245456000,2,814,4.2243589743589745

Good father/son relationship movie, as well. There is excitement, suspense, adventure, and of course the prerequisite bad guys (why?!) ~who don't do any permanent damage.",1229904000,,334,5.090909090909091

2561626,4,B000FDE5U8,"Although the title may have you thinking of a Japanese Animated short, this is a live action movie similar to the Lochness one that is out. This takes place in current day Canada. When a young boy must go with his father to recover an expensive drill bit in a deep lake he is peeved. After all his father has promised multiple rides on the rollercoaster and they haven't seen the theme park yet. It takes this kid a while to realize his dad isn't the only selfish one in the family, but he does after making friends with what appears to be a cross between a Walrus and a Plesiosaur. His decision that dad doesn't need to blow chunks at the theme park to make him happy shows he is growing up and becoming aware that his personal feelings aren't the only ones to consider.

The story centers on a child falling in the water and being saved by a giant mammal while his dad is in a deep submersible trying to salvage a drill bit. His dad runs into some unfriendly salvagers to give the story a villain. This villain is not only nasty to people, but to the water giant as well. Never annoy a water giant as there may be parent water giant that will spank you. This movie kept my interest and I imagine it would appeal to most kids. Definitely a family friendly movie. If you enjoyed ""ET"" you will probably like it. Frank Oz's company did a nice job on the creatures. If you liked this be sure to catch ""The Waterhorse - Legend of the Deep"". Good quality DVD with decent replayability.",1210809600,,1480,4.285714285714286
2561627,5,B000FDE5U8,"Mee-Shee: The water Giant  DVD

This movie is kind of a cross between E. T. and the Loch Ness Monster. The movie is a little over the top with many unrealistic occurrences. However, it is fun and the kids really enjoyed it.

The parts that some people may be offended by are when the boy uses the words ""die furball"" to a stuffed animal. This is a realistic reaction for a kid that just had his dream of going to Disney Land destroyed! The other offensive phrase was when a little girl calls the boy ""dirt bag"". Personally, I didn't think the movie needed to add these phrases but that is all the negative wording that I heard in this movie.

There is some violence in the movie especially at the end that might disturb young viewers. However, most of the movie is mild. Another thing that some people might object to is that the bad guys supposedly worked for Green Peace. We felt that they worked for a rival oil company and just used Green Peace as their cover. The movie doesn't really elaborate.

If you're an adult, you'll probably pick this movie apart and find all the things wrong with it. But if you're a child, you'll really enjoy the story line. My kids couldn't get enough of this movie which really says it all. It's no more violent than the Lion King or other Disney films.

Recommended for families with pre-teens or so.

2561628,5,B000FDE5U8,"Let me begin by saying that I first viewed this with trepidation -as it sounded really cheesy.  Yes - at times, there are some of the standard villain/good guy/kid stuff scenes - but overall, this is really a fun movie!  My kids (8 yrs old) love it, they get scared when they think Mee-Shee is in trouble, they get excited when all is well (no spoilers...), they laugh a lot, and really stay engaged in the story. Even better, I really think they take away the lesson of caring for others as a message.

Acting is good - it doesn't feel forced, the animation is actually pretty well done - and it's a movie I have enjoyed watching with my children more than once!  It's quite kid friendly, teaches without being obvious and a nice departure from cartoon type movies (which I also enjoy...)  Definetely worth a watch or two!",1193702400,2,823,4.46
