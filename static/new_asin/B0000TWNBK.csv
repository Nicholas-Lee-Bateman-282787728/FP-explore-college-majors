1945944,4,B0000TWNBK,"***....""And Texas, Phoenix-like shall rise, with Freedom's pinions proudly spread;  hailed by those Spirits of the Skies, that on ""her"" altars nobly bled""..
(ode to Crockett - pg 364 of ""Alamo Traces"")***

This is not a movie, it's a documentary, hosted by Dennis Quaid, who did plug his movie during the forwards.  This ""History Channel"" DVD version of the story of The Alamo is a very good accompaniment to any reading done by history enthusiasts regarding Texas or the Alamo.  While it makes every effort to give a fair and balanced accounting of the high running feelings, the political climates and the way Texas was first colonized illegally, (even featuring a very emotional insert by a female Mexican historian)it should be noted that there was quite a lot more to it than that. In the haste to present a ""balanced view"" of both sides, it somehow missed quite ""enough"" focus on ""enough"" of the underlying causes of the Alamo crisis, for a proper in-depth ""history channel"" accounting; at least in my estimation, since I have sought out and read some fine Mexican history too. True enough that the settlers were usurpers and started infringing on Mexican-held land ""anywhere they pleased"" with the aid of corrupt land speculators (Jim Bowie being one of them) and the Mexican government decided to put it down before it could rise up.  But the real issue was with the Mexican government itself - and it's ""principles of governance"" after they ""were settled there under Mexican rule"" that began to cause the unrest. And that could be construed as a ""fair and balanced"" approach to history too, because it affected Tejanos as well as Texicans, and they stood together to take the split from Mexico.  (some of the older films made of this conflict were indeed, preposterous)

Because: The Mexican government at the time was a brutal and corrupt dictatorship, and even more so against their own people further South where the power was concentrated. That was what the Mexican Revolution was all about much later, in 1910, when Zapata attempted to do the same thing himself for the Mexican people, who had had the very life blood squeezed out of them by the corrupt government; ruling them with injustice, ""taxation without representation) and a bloody, iron hand under the ""Honor Amongst The Bureaucratic Thieves"" format.  (To read more on THAT subject from an excellent source, I recommend: ""Zapata and The Mexican Revolution"" by John Womack, Jr.). In my own view, the siege at the Alamo is given much more weight of meaning when taken in context with what was happening to the people of Mexico under rulers and military men like Santa Anna.

The final example is how the bodies were treated after the Alamo defeat - burned instead of buried.  Perhaps it was due to nothing more than prudence; perhaps it was a problem that need to be dealt with hastily. But perhaps too, it was the final insult; the culmination of the ""red flag"" that was still flying.  Take no prisoners, bury no bodies.

The final battle immediately later at San Jacinto was quite a blow to the ego of Santa Anna, who liked to compare himself with Napoleon.  Perhaps the Napoleon slogan should then have been modified to read:  ""God is on the side of the strongest batallion - except at San Jacinto"".

Nonetheless, if one is interested in History of the Southwest, this ""history channel"" DVD is another good place to compare notes with what one has already read.  This film also includes some special features afrter the film about the life of Davy Crockett, and another regarding the early years of the Texas Rangers, which I found intensely interesting.  That's another era of Frontier Justice that won't win any ""political correctness"" awards today, but strip away the ""now"" and replace it with ""the then"" and it is readily apparent why it started off the way it did and subsequently evolved into what it became later and is today.",1299369600,9,3908,4.826347305389222
1945945,3,B0000TWNBK,"Great job with the details of the Alamo and the scenery. However, these folks sort down-play the heroes of the Alamo. They are critical of the US Government and at one point make the claim that the US Government was no better than Santa Ana. It is all about trying to be ""politically correct."" I would have mixed feelings about showing this one to just anyone. I would not want others to think I agreed with everything stated against our heroes of the Alamo.",1226793600,8,458,4.464285714285714
1945946,2,B0000TWNBK,"Overall, an average documentary (disc 1) that tries to view both sides of the battle for the Alamo and San Antonio.
However, I found it rather apalling that some historians are now labeling the heroic leaders inside the Alamo, as ""drunkards"", ""criminals"", ""land swindlers"" and ""wife abandoners"", claiming that their main reason for leaving the United States and heading to Texas was to escape their problems and crimes.
They then label General Santa Anna as a great military leader, much like Napoleon.  They forget to mention that Santa Anna was a brutal dictator and later captured without a shred of military insignia, and had to be identified by his own men.
Just another example of Revisionist's history.
If you want to know what more likely happened at the Alamo, I suggest you read, Walter Lords book, ""A Time to Stand"".  By far the best literature on the subject.",1187654400,9,871,4.878378378378378
1945947,3,B0000TWNBK,"I am actually going to revise my earlier review a bit, as I recently screened this documentary again, after doing more research on the topic.  My earlier comments remain mostly valid, but I need to add a few more concerns.  As another reviewer noted, the narrative of the documentary sometimes presents speculative conclusions as verified fact.  Granted, the conclusions are based on some evidence, but that evidence is not always so reliable as the documentary would suggest.  The annoying phrases ""most historians agree"" or ""most historians now accept"" are misleading.  Historians always argue and almost never agree...especially on a topic so controversial.  I guess the idea was to make the documentary seem authoritative.  Watch the documentary, but don't accept everything presented without finding out more about the Alamo.  I've been reading about the Alamo for over 40 years now, and the more I learn the more I am convinced that there is still much solid research that needs to be done.",1086566400,25,996,5.142857142857143
1945948,3,B0000TWNBK,"While containing numerous positive elements the video, unfortunatly shows a subtle bias twoard some major characters especially on the side of the rebels.  The program accuratly depicts all of the characters as flawed individuals.  In some cases, such as Bowie and Travis seriously flawed.  However, instances of extremely honorable behavior on the part of some major characters are, unfortunatly, omitted.  For example, that Crockett lost his seat in congress for opposing the dispossession of the Native American population  in the Southeastern United States is, unfortunatly, omitted.  This display of integrity and honorable behavior by Crockett gives an invaluable insight into his character and should have been included.
That films about the battle of the Alamo tend to show the Mexicans as vicious at best and sadistic at worst is generally true.  There are examples to the contrary. An example is John Wayne's movie, The Alamo. While not a great or historically accurate film, John Wayne's epic is very sympathetic to the Mexicans. In Wayne's film Santa Anna is shown behaving chivalrously in letting the women and children evacuate the Alamo and saluting Susanna Dickenson as she and the other survivors leave the fort after the battle.  In this movie Crockett defends a Mexican woman against an American who is persecuting her.  Juan Seguin has a significant, and positive part in the film.  In the depiction of the probing attack defenders of the Alamo praise the courage of the attacking Mexicans.  And Richard Widmark, as Bowie, waxes eloquent in his love for Mexico and the Mexican people.
The program misses an opprtunity to use more of the de la Pena diary, now conceeded by most to be substantially authentic, allthough otherwise its sourcing was good.
On the subject of casualties, it is interesting that Santa Anna claimed the number of casualties among the defenders to be 600.  It is possible that he picked this number because it exceeded his own casualties.  All things considered, it seems likely that several hundred Mexican Soldiers died in the battle.
In short, a very good documentary missed a chance to be a great one.",1071619200,28,2148,5.1203438395415475
1945949,2,B0000TWNBK,"This is a unique look at the Alamo, but not a particularly good one.  I have found that some History Channel documentaries are grossly inaccurate, and I suspect this one of just that flaw.  Everyone knows something of what happened at the Alamo--the movies, books, and legends of the battle that took place there are many--but this film seems to concentrate on removing the myth from the Alamo, and of dismissing as fable most of the stories about that fateful battle.
The problem, however, is that the film is not very convincing in its dismissal of legend.  It denies that Col. Travis ever made his famous line in the sand, and that the defenders of the Alamo were there only because they thought reenforcements were coming soon.  It alleges that Davy Crockett surrendered, and that he was executed while pleading for his life.  I have no problem with dispelling myths in an attempt to retain history, but there is a problem with all of this:  there were no American survivors.  How are we to know that Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie did not die fighting?  The very problem of this film is that it is every bit as speculative (and sometimes more) as the 'legends' it is trying to disprove.
I agree with the makers of the film that the Alamo legend has gotten way out of proportion.  The Disney movie and John Wayne films about Davy Crockett and the Alamo have made the man into more of a myth than a reality.  But the fact remains--we cannot know exactly what happened that day.  So, with that said, is it so bad that we want to make heroes out of Bowie, Crockett, Travis, and the others?",1050192000,29,1587,4.513986013986014
