8540194,5,B009DA73WG,"The two classic neo-realist gems from Visconti would be enough to recommend this collection.  ""Ludwig"" is very long, but all the real location photography makes it worth it.  ""L'Innocente"" may be second tier Visconti, but that is still better than most.  4 films that are not shown much anymore.",1470009600,,295,4.979591836734694
8540195,3,B009DA73WG,"I recently received my copy of the ""Luchino Visconti Four Film Collection,"" purchased for a rather hefty $100+ from a vendor whose name I shall not mention here. And I must say that I was rather disappointed with the package I received!

I am unreservedly a fan of the films of Luchino Visconti, While I've seen only two of the films in this set (""La Terra Trema"" and ""Ludwig""), I admire them both greatly. I've also seen ""The Leopard,"" ""The Damned"" and ""Death In Venice,"" and those also rank among my favorite films. I have yet to see ""Bellissima"" or ""L'Innocente,"" but I have a feeling I'll really enjoy those, as well.

The problem with the used copy I received from the vendor is that while the item I ordered was referred to as being in ""Very Good"" condition, it turns out that the copy I just received today was some castoff from a public library! And it's quite obviously been through quite a few people's hands, all five discs being covered with scratches! And the packaging also reflects the item's status as a library castoff, seeing as how most public libraries tend to store their DVD box sets in these multiple-disc storage cases to save space. I don't know if this particular box set originally housed the individual DVD's in separate cases, but the packaging of my copy sure looks like a space-saving library job to me!

I know, I know. I'm probably being waaaaaaayyy too finicky about the matter. For all I know, the discs in this package will play completely fine and I won't have any problem whatsoever. (I can only hope...) The fact of the matter is, I probably became interested in this item far too late! I wanted to get a brand new copy, but for whatever reason Amazon is out of stock. I don't even know if this collection is currently out of print or not (although I know that all films in the set except ""Ludwig"" are still in print and available separately).

I suppose time will tell if that $100+ will have been worth it. I'm certainly keeping my fingers crossed, and I certainly hope I don't get any sort of stuttering, skipping or picture breakage! The bottom line is...When I put down over $100 of my hard-earned money to buy a copy of something which is listed as being in ""Very Good"" condition, I don't expect to get some castoff from a public library with all five discs covered in scratches from passing through God only knows how many hands!

So, like my headline says: The films are great, Luchino Visconti is great, but my particular copy leaves much to be desired!",1429142400,6,2501,4.536585365853658
