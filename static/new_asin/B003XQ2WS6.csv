These dvd's have helped me grasp the concepts within my books a little more. It's great when you don't have to will power to sit down and read a book. I have also found watching them repeatedly to learn the concepts less painful than originally thought, as I am the type of person who falls alseep though lecture easily.

I found the material within these dvd's is good and covers most of the things I will be studying although not completely indepth.

To the people who critise these series of course it isn't supposed to be a complete text book on the subject, no text book/dvd is. But for those of us who have a hard time retaining information or people who are about to sit an exam its a great overview.

Love love these series and wish there were more!!!",1336608000,4,896,4.3532934131736525
