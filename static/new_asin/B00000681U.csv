7903936,4,B00000681U,"Is it just me or does anyone else find it suspicious that they have released literally every other ''best of'' DVD  by the SNL Alumni but Chevy Chase? something very strange here & if it indeed is an oversight & not a conscious omission, it is absolutely ridiculous! come on people, get with it already!",1424044800,,303,4.509090909090909
7903937,5,B00000681U,"I have one unit at my place where I can watch DVDs and VHS ... This is rip-roaringly funny! ... A precursor to many of Chevy's later characters, in the movies: Clark Griswold, Fletch, Emit Fitz Hume and Ty Webb.  I don't know what happened to this guy, I wish he would do something funny again.  He's too bitter and all caught up in political things ... Someone tell him, people liked him when he was funny.  His couple guest appearances, later on, on SNL are hilarious as well on video!",1310774400,,487,4.329670329670329
