1078613,5,6305813027,"I'd heard a lot about this series in the past, but I'd never actually watched it until purchasing this box set. First impressions............Slightly odd, slightly twisted. Martial arts, combat, romance and characters who  change into different things when splashed with cold water, Ranma changes  from a dark haired boy, into a busty red headed girl, and back again with  hot water, this is definitely not a boring story.  Differing from the  excellent Tenchi OVA set, this story of Ranma doesn't start at what can be  called the beginning, and at first this caused some confusion. However  watching some of the extras on the three discs, the story explains itself.  Suddenly from initially being slightly strange, with gender bending  characters, the story has now become addictive. I've now watched this set  several times, and it keeps getting better. The presentation and picture  quality are excellent, equalling that of the Tenchi box set. All in all  this is an excellent package in presentation, story and content. If you  enjoy the Tenchi Muyo series, Ranma is a must for your collection. If like  me you haven't seen any Ranma episodes before, this set is a great  introduction, and although it may seem strange at first, it is highly  addictive and very enjoyable, it's a purchase you won't regret.",961632000,9,1310,5.023255813953488
1078614,5,6305813027,"In 1995, I took a job grading standardized tests while working on my degree.  My first assignment was grading essays written by 11th graders in Oklahoma.  And while many of the essays were dreadfully composed, one  student in particular wrote an excellent essay on Japanese Anime.  At that  time, I had searched for animation that matched the humor, edge, and wit of  the classic Warner Brothers' cartoons, and had met with little success.  In  this essay I graded, this student used Ranma  to illustrate the best  characteristics of Anime - bilingual puns, hilarious situations, and  subjects that certainly would not qualify as politically correct.  Shortly  after the essay, I sampled many of the various Anime and Manga distributed  by VIZ, and to my disappointment, found much of this genre poorly written  and poorly animated.
 I found Ranma , however, an exception to the  mediocrity that plagues so much Anime and American animation today.  And in  my opinion, this collection of stories is of better quality than the  television series or feature-length movies.  Without exception, the  animation of the OAV series surpasses that of the television series and  compares favorably with the two theatrical releases.  I also find that the  pacing of the OAV episodes is better than both theatrical releases.  In the  OAV series, the timing of the gags is impeccable, the characters are well  developed, and the satire, while sometimes gentle, is often razor sharp.  And if you investigate the stories more closely, you will find that Rumiko  Takahashi has a knack for retelling Japanese myths and legends in hilarious  ways, often turning your every expectation on its head (Reawakening  Memories, Hell Hath No Fury, and One Grew Over the Kuno's Nest).  And, when  you compare the quality, length, and cost of the OAV series on DVD to that  of the movies, the OAV series is the one to buy.
Finally, should the  student who introduced me to this amazing series read this review, thank  you.",959299200,25,1994,4.98776758409786
1078615,5,6305813027,"Simply put, Ranma rules, the OAVs are amazing. They are a must see for anyone, a fan or new to Ranma. Buy them today, you won't regret it.",959126400,,138,3.9642857142857144
1078616,5,6305813027,"If you are buting this DVD set it means you actually know Ranma's history, so I'm reviewing just the DVD presentation. The case is very original, all three DVDs come together, the box unfolds and shows the DVDs. It has a  space for a booklet, but there is only a sheet with the episodes list, I  think they should make a booklet or something. The DVD menus are fine, easy  to use, maybe more colors in the menus were needed, but it's ok. The last  DVD has all the op. and ending from the original japansese edition without  credits, so, you get the RANMA DOCO LD for free. It has the transcription  of the Animericca interview to Rumiko Takahashi, and other goodies. The  subtitles are just too yellow for my taste, but you get used to them. By  the other side, the subtitles are very close to the original japanese  meaning. For example, in An Akane to Remember (OVA Special) Ranma says in  english (dub): ""There's something you don't know: Akane is  mine!"", but in japanese he actually said something different... and  the subtitles are according to that. So, I suggest you to buy this DVDs if  you are a Ranma fan, the price is just great, and you'll be very happy with  them.",959040000,17,1179,4.4485981308411215
1078617,5,6305813027,"All I can say is..Finally! I rented the 1st of this series by accident at a Blockbuster one day and all I can say is... I as hooked! The stories funny, the charecters interesting and the voices were the best I had seen  in any dubbed anime. The Episodes on this set are the OAV (Original  Animation Videos)that were released sporadically while the series  continued. For example in my all-time favorite episode ""Stormy  Weather:Growng Up with Miss Hinako"" - We are introduced to Hapossi  long before he was introduced in the series. Still, without watching the  series, you can and will enjoy this set. A MUST for any Ranma fan!",958867200,6,628,4.663636363636364
1078618,5,6305813027,"Well, since Ranma is an older series and most likely anyone buying the dvd set will probably know the general plot to Ranma, I won't go into a synopsis on the OAV series in this set. I'll comment instead on the  presentation. First off, the box is encased in a plastic see-thru slip  cover ala Fushigi Yuugi. It even opens up ala Fushigi Yuugi. There are  pictues of Ranma, Genma, Shampoo, Moose, and Ranma's mom?(Or Akane's) in  the inside covers. The disc hub is unfortunately that ungiving, unmoving  hard hub that feels like you can split a disc while removing them. Be  careful with the discs while doing so. Also, included in a side pocket to  the sleeve is a sheet detailing the episodes in order along with a general  synopsis of the story. Picture quality in this set is great. Crystal clear  although I did find one minor picture glitch in my first disc. Subtitles  are done in yellow with black background which is a bit harsh on the eyes.  The subtitles also seem to shimmer a bit. I find it's a little bit  annoying, but liveable. Still, despite some minor quips, the set is worth  its price if you're a Ranma fan.",957916800,32,1127,4.465686274509804

1078620,5,6305813027,"A must see for any anime fan!  the animation is good and so is the dubbing.  this is not your typical anime, Ranma is engaged to one of his fathers firends three daughters and the series is his story and hardships  in living with jellous would be sutors and his own curse.  You cant really  say much more or I would give away too much of the plot.  Needless to say  Ranma 1/2 is verry addictive, I was hooked after the first episode.  Hope  they put more of this serries on DVD.",955238400,7,478,4.108695652173913
1078770,5,6305813027,"Fist I want to say that I bought the two disc DvD set, and I had no extras, which made me mad at first, but I am a forgiving person! Anyway all the episodes were good except the third episode, even though I saw Ranma's mom for the first time (I've seen seasons 1-6) It was very... boring at times. My favorite episode would have to be the first one. It was so nice to finally see Shampoo get her revenge on Ranma for treating her like dirt.

  Anyway, the opening for the first six episodes was boring, but the opening for the other half, was cool. I liked the song in both english and Japanese, (Though it is louder in Japanese) The ending for both is... ok. Also in the second episode where they do Karaoke, The english is... TERRIBLE! I cannot stand it in english, it's just bad.

  I recommend watching the tv serie before this though, because it expects you to know who EVERYONE is. Also, almost EVERYONE is in this. Everyone meaning, the gambling king, Ling-Ling, and Lung-Lung, and all them other people(Even the people from the darn tea ceramony episodes.)

  Now, this series does raise some questions. First WHY does Ranma want Shampoo to love him if he ""Doesn't"" like her? Second (Also last) Why wasn't Hinako in the tv series? She would have been a great character! Now, there are many episodes for fans of Ranma & Akane, and also a little Ranma & Shampoo.(Yay!)

  Overall, if you want a great Ranma series, this is a great direction to look!",1116633600,2,1455,4.428571428571429
1078771,5,6305813027,"I don't own this yet but I will be ordering it soon.  One thing I can tell you about it is though that one of these so called OAV episodes is acually a movie. Yes one of these is acually the third movie, it's that the style of it was so simular to an OAV that it is confused with the OAVs alot. You will enjoy this product though because all of Ranma 1/2 is good.",1075680000,2,363,3.776315789473684
1078772,5,6305813027,"Here it is, the best Ranma 1/2 episodes of the Ranmaverse.  The animation is top notch.  Lots of people who see this will probably notice that Ranma's (female) voice is different compared to the others.  Another stand out is during the ""Tendo Family Christmas Scramble"" while the girls are singing karaoke, they sing ""Little Date"" (the second opening theme) in english, if you know the song, they forget to say the lyrics ""Fall in love!"", you can also tell because their mouths are moving but nothing is coming out.  Besides these two things everything is terrific.  Sorry for pointing out a few defects, but I just had to bring it up.  Still don't let these little, almost microscopic defects ruin your decision of buying it, it is worth every penny.",1061424000,3,751,4.7384615384615385
1078773,5,6305813027,"I have to say, this is probably one of the best Ranma 1/2 series out there.  The art is just amazing.  The only thing I though was out of place was some of the comedy moments where people went flying.  It just didn't seem to fit into the incredibly art, awsome fight sceens, and touching moments.  But hey, it was funny anyway.  This series has a lot of fan service foe Ranma/Akane fans.  The end of ""An Akane to Remember"" is really sweet.  Also for fans of this stlye of Ranma 1/2 art, the second Ranma movie ""Nihao my Concubine"" is a must see!  For new fans, if you haven't seen the first series, see it!  It has a bunch of important plot points.  Like why Ryoga is in love with Akane, why Shampoo thinks Ranma is her fiance', and why Akane and Ranma fight so much.  It will really help you appreciate the comedy in the other series!",1052438400,,835,4.188679245283019
1078774,5,6305813027,"If you are hesitant about getting this, as I was at first, go with it. It is totally hilarious, especially the first one, with Shampoo in the 'Curse of the Contrary Jewel'. I was waiting to see the 'Tendo Family Christmas Scramble' and was not disappointed, especially with the Kareoke done by Doco. There are a few sweet episodes, with 'Akane vs. Ranma! I'll Be the One to Inherit Mother's Recipes!'
Overall, the best ones would have to be a two-parter, episodes 7 and 8, 'Reawakening Memories, Parts 1 and 2.' Hilarious and touching, with introductions of one-shots characters that you won't soon forget.
This also includes 'Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix' which was released as a movie in Japan. In 'Oh Cursed Tennel of Lost Love! Let My Love Be Forever!' pay very close attention to the names, which will have you cracking up if you know anything about old television shows.
The entire collection has amazing animation, better then all the seasons and the two movies. The extras are great. It has detailed floor plans of almost the entire Tendo house, trailers, an interview with Takahashi, character profiles and over a dozen music videos by Doco. Doco is the group that the voice actors of girl Ranma, Akane, Nabiki, Shampoo, and Kasumi formed. Even if you don't speak Japanese, you should still love these. The songs are beautiful and the animation is great as well. This collection is the perfect buy for any Ranma 1/2 fan.",1044748800,,1437,4.775100401606426
1078775,5,6305813027,"Ranma 1/2 fans absolutely need the OAV series to have a complete set! The OAV series are the origiaal animes released after the Ranma 1/2 series had originally ended. All of the OAV's are extremely funny, very vibrant as well, because the animation is a little different, plus you get to see the original Japanese dialogue intros and outros for each one (or for you Ranma fans, the DoCo videos).
This is really cool too, plus if you get the boxed set, no more running around trying to find some of the harder titles like ""Desperately seeking Shampoo"" and ""Akane and her Sisters"". Plus you'll be saving so much money when you buy the set instead of buying each one, one by one which will add up VERY quickly. If you're an old Ranma fan, then you need this one. If you're new to the Ranma 1/2 series, unfortunately you'll have to go all the way back to the 1st Season, because you won't get it otherwise. Again, check out the OAV series, and if you haven't make sure to get the other boxed sets!",1038873600,,993,4.372972972972973
1078776,5,6305813027,"If you don't know the story of Ranam 1/2 its about a boy named...Ranma Saotome who went training with his father (Genma) in Jusenkyo, China. This training ground is cursed and has Springs of drowned SOMETHINGS, While training Genma falls into Spring of drowned Panda, so when splashed with cold water, Genma turns to a panda and splashed with hot water turns back to a man. And Ranma...well he fell in spring of drowned girl. So you gessed it, he turns into a girl.
Animation is top notch (like the MOTION PICTURES)
The first one (Shampoos Sudden Switch...) is by far the best! Order this now!
This OAV set is wounderful!
There are 12 all together and 4 of then (All on second DVD) are in two parters! (LOL Soan crys all through #6!)
They also added some cool stuff like all the music videos from the VHS versions! (You just got to love Baled of Ranma and Akana)
Anyway i do recomend this for alll Ranma fans and for all ANME lovers out there!!",1023148800,,944,4.4
1078777,5,6305813027,"If you want an introduction to Ranma, this set is not good for you. If you loved the tv seasons and manga, you just found the spot. This dvd contains 12 episodes (OAV) that means they are not part od the tv series, but aditional standalone chapters. In fact, they are 10 complete stories, because the second dvd has two stories of two episodes each, but believe me, they are the best ones.
Excelent quality, in japanese and english versions, but you'll prefer japanese with subtitles. Also, each AOV has its own opening and closing songs, but they were replaced on each disc by the ones dubbed to english. The good news is that all the original songs were placed in the last disc, without the anoying credits!!!.  Those are the DOCO songs, the group of voice actresses of the serie. Some of the best songs from Ranma. If you have the cds (DOCO first, DOCO second or DOCO Karaoke), now you'll have the videos!!!!
So, If you know Ranma universe, let me get you interested in the stories: Will Akane really change Ranma's love for another boy from her past? Why is Ranma trying to win Shampoo's love? Would the terrible Tunnel of Lost Love (the couple separator) torn apart Ramna and Akane's love? What! Kasumi doing REALLY BAD things!!! Why, would that be because Shoun Tendo had two more dauthers who figth better than Ranma and Akane together, and came to reclaim the Tendo's DOJO? Well, Ranma better gets to figure out how to win the final battle, against a teacher who can stole her opponent's power with a coin (without lossing his class). How does it sound?
Enjoy it.",1022544000,2,1571,4.570921985815603
1078778,4,6305813027,"I bought this series as my entrance into Rumiko Takahashi's world of Ranma and in hindsight, this wasn't a very smart move.
That doesn't say I didn't enjoy this series, which I did, but it left me with questions unanswered. How/When/Why did Ranma get his curse exactly (explained in the first TV season), why is he afraid of cats (als the first season), etc..
That said, as this OAV series takes place much later in the TV series, it took a few viewings to get the most out of it.
The packaging is familiar to that of hte Tenchi Muyo ultimate OAV collection (cardboard fold-out with plastic holders for the dvds), sturdy enough but I'd prefer jewel-cases to protect the dvds even better.
The DVD menus are simple, yet effective, and only the last disc contains any extras. Annoying is that the language is English by default (I prefer the original japanese), but that's a minor thing.
The transfer is good, but has some rainbows and pixellation here and there. It's too bad they didn't use the original Japanese masters, the quality is still good, but there's hard credits and subtitles everywhere, which I would've preferred to be optional.
I won't say much about the episodes themselves (read the editorial or other reviews), except hat I enjoyed them a lot.
This set is perfect for anyone already acquainted with Ranma.",1020211200,,1322,4.752173913043478

1078869,5,6305813027,"The OAV series of Ranma 1/2 is definitely not for those who have never seen the series before.  The OAVs pretty much assume you know quite a bit about the series and go from there.  I would STRONGLY suggest you watch the first few seasons of the TV series before you watch the OAVs.  But when you do . . . it will be worth the wait.
The OAVs for the Ranma 1/2 series are exciting, are VERY well done both graphically and musically.  The storylines are awesome, and well outside the standard panty-stealing, aqua-transexual stuff we usually see.  Almost every one of the OAVs is an adventure of some sort, although a few of them are more like gloried TV episodes - such as the Christmas special one.
Over all if you like Ranma 1/2 you will love the OAV series.  If you like anime in general, but have never seen Ranma 1/2 I would watch a few episodes before you dive into the OAV.",1006560000,,879,4.265060240963855

All the episodes here are based on stories in the later Ranma 1/2 manga(comic books).It starts around book 20 and I'm still seeing the stories in book 30 (Japanese books, the Viz graphics versions are in the same order but they seem to put 1&1/2 Japanese manga into one of their graphic novels.) They seem to keep the same continuity as the books mostly, so if you're a solid Ranma 1/2 fan you'll be happy.
The film quality is pretty good and the stories they chose seemed to work on film.

1078871,5,6305813027,"Technical:
This Boxed set features 12 OAV episodes.
This set of 3 DVDs were mastered well and shows off the high quality animation. There are very little compression artifacts. I had to look hard to find one. The sound is Dolby Digital 2.0 in Japanese and English (although the English version sound like the bass should be turned down a notch).
Story:
This set was not intended for newcomers to the Ranma  world. There is very little to no character introduction in this DVD set. For those looking to see the Ranma series from the beginning, take a look at ""Ranma 1/2 Digital Dojo - The Complete First Season Boxed Set.""
The first episode starts right off with a zany comical love triangle between Ranma, Akane, and Shampoo. But that's the way most of these episodes are: A zany wacky comical love triangle.
Ranma:
The Ranma  series is a story about a boy who is training at the ""Anything goes Dojo of Martial Arts."" A while ago, Ranma's father took him on a quest to train when they ""fell"" into a curse. Now Ranma, his father, and other characters is this series have to be careful around water. The curse turns Ranma into a girl when he is soaked with cold water. Yes, he actually morphs into a girl, his father turn into a Panda bear! Warm water turns them back to normal, but you can guess how a boy turning into a girl can create some ""interesting"" situations.
The real story is centered on how Ranma and his fianc, Akane (don't) get along. Their problem is that they both love each other, but they're just to stuck-up and arrogant to admit it. Throw in three other women who are trying to steal Ranma's heart, and other men who are trying to steal Akane's and you have a real winner!
This is a lighthearted romantic comedy that I think everyone will enjoy.
Not for little kids though, slight language and brief nudity.",1003536000,7,1825,4.493975903614458

1078873,4,6305813027,"This DVD set is a great compilation of the Ranma OVA series, with the obvious added benefits of DVD media
Although these are original anime stories, regular Ranma fans will realises that many of these stories could easily have been included in the TV series and could be argued that the quality of the some of the stories are not worthy of OVA treatment.  There are a few stories which are a bit 'special', but none have the predictable story line of Ranma and friends running to save Akane from trouble, or any random acts of chaos around the neighbourhood in an attempt to introduce the audience to the characters.  The stories are variety, some have plenty of action, others with less action, and more focused on the characters realtionships
The art of the DVD is excellent, however this can also be said of some of the later Ranma TV series as well.  The only real difference is the length of each epsiode, which runs for a 30 mins (incl credits).  The voice acting by Viz is done well, and this includes good lip synching (which is why sometimes does not match the subtitles, but the context remains the same)
The DVD contains standard scene selections, choice of two audible languages and english subtitles.  Extra features are only included on the third disc, which include some sketches of the Tendou household, character summaries, some short music videos, and an interview with Takahashi Rumiko (creator).  The DVDs are strictly region 1 NTSC encoding, so it would pay to check out compatibility with your DVD player.
I enjoyed the variety of stories in this set.  You can get tired of the same old story in Ranma for too long, and I certainly enjoyed this far more than the Ranma movies.",992217600,8,1698,4.677852348993288

The animation is beautiful and the stories are clever and cute. ^_^  It's a good choise for anime fans who like the puffball kinda stuff, but feel that there are WAY TOO MANY EPISODES OF RANMA 1/2!!!  A feeling I share with many of my friends.  While some episodes are good, and the first season is very funny, they get old and you have to sift through the bad stuff to find the really good ones.  These bad episodes my friends and I have lovingly dubbed ""The Crack Episodes.""  We feel that the animators, writers, and/or Voice actors were high on crack when the epidode was made.  Every anime has them, but Ranma has too many of them.  Save yourself the troube and get the OAV because all of them have the best stories.  My advice would be to get the first season, OAV, and movies to get the most out of the funny but tiresom series.

But...  the OAV episodes are noticeably inferior to the Original TV series.
If you are an avid fan of the TV series, that has  watched a lot of episodes from each season, you'll be somewhat disappointed  by this OAV series.
It just doesn't really capture the personality of  the original TV series. I just didn't feel the Ranma magic in this one. I  can't place my finger on what is missing--perhaps some story elements are  weak and the comic timing is off.
On the positive side, the animation is  great and the DVD is packed with many features.

1078878,5,6305813027,"Ranma 1/2 is a highly popular ramantic martial arts comedy.  Gender roles, food and splashing water are the basis for physical comedy; while the fact that Ranma has multiple fiancees (Akane, Shampoo, ...) provides the basis  for romantic comedy.
I've seen more than a few Ranma episodes/movies,  and this OVA series easily reigns supreme. In contrast to other Ranma  stuff, this series provides deeper insight into the Ranma and Akane  characters.  Without viewing this series, you won't know who they really  are.
As expected of an OVA, the quality of animation was great. However,  the ""Love Panic"" theme song was a special delight.  Juxtaposition  of the Japanese and English tracks reveals a rare bi-lingual synergy.  Credits free ""Music Video"" version is in a bonus track.
The  ""Desperately Seeking Shampoo"" episode is my all-time favorite.  The true feelings of Shampoo, Akane and Ranma are revealed.  If you're not  into the Shampoo  character, you probably will be after seeing this one.  ^-^
Exceptional cuteness was in the ""Japanese Doll"" episode.  I  also noticed special extra cuteness in the box set enclosure with comic  images hidden under the DVD disks and on the plastic protective  sleave.

7895404,5,6305813027,"This is a 12 episode OVA that continues the Ranma 1/2 story. I'm not sure where this fell chronologically in relation to the series, but it doesn't conclude the anime. It's more like just extra fun, if I had to describe it. It starts off strong with a story about my favorite Ranma 1/2 character, Shampoo. She comes across a jewel that reverses her feelings for Ranma. This bothers him, so he pursues her and attempts to win her back. There is also a Christmas episode, a hot spring episode where Akane body swaps with a cursed doll, an episode where Kasumi is possessed by an ogre and nobody has the heart to knock the demon out of her. There are several other hilarious episodes in this OVA. Most of it is just fun, a lot like the series.

What makes this stand out is the production quality. The animation is on a completely different level than the series. The soundtrack is different. I think I like it a little better. The voice actors are the same as well. Most fans of the series know that Ranma was replaced with Richard Cox somewhere in the middle around episode 65 or so. Sarah Strange does his voice in the OVA. I'm assuming the OVA takes place in the first half because of that. That's not really important though. What's important is that this is a great OVA. I was very happy and pleasantly surprised. The case looks good and comes with a decorative clear plastic sleeve to protect it. I think that fans of the series will enjoy this DVD set.  I highly recommend it.",1363564800,,1481,4.401459854014599

My husband has been a Ranma 1/2 fan for a long time and has painstakingly collected all of the box sets. When we found this OVA set, we were shocked to find additions to the series that neither of us had even heard of. Needless to say, our collection is definitely complete with this purchase and each episode complements the original series well.

Each episode is its own contained adventure that explores the large cast of interesting characters and gives long time fans a chance to see new scenes and awkward situations between their favorite pairings. I watched this set before ever seeing Ranma 1/2 the original series and still had a great time viewing. You don't need much back story to enjoy the comedy and antics here!

As for packaging. The art on the cover is bright and clean. On the back you see Ranma in girl form dressed as a tiger. Rawr! When you fold open the box (this is not a typical DVD box) you see a large picture of Ranma in girl form in a swim suit and on the right is a picture of Ranma's mother in a beautiful kimono. Fold out one more time to finally get to the three DVDs. They are snug and secure and feature Mr. Panda, Shampoo in animal form, and Moussee in animal form on the discs as well as the back panels beneath each disc. Very cute! A sturdy, clear plastic slip slides right over the box to keep the beautiful artwork protected and clean.

The episodes included are:
Disc 1:
Curse of the Contrary Jewel
Tendo Family Christmas Scramble
Akane Vs. Ranma! I'll Be The One To Inherit Mother's Recipes!
Stormy Weather Comes to School! Growing Up With Miss Hinako!

Disc 2:
The One To Carry On: Part 1
The One To Carry One: Part 2
Reawakening Memories Part 1
Reawakening Memories Part 2

Disc 3:
Team Ranma Vs. the Legendary Phoenix
Oh Cursed Tunnel of Lost Love! Let My Love Be Forever
Hell Hath No fury Like Kasumi Scorned
The Two Akanes, ""Ranma, Look At Me!""

It's a great mix of nearly love scenes and battle scenes, as well as quirky comedy and even some new characters.

The total run time is about 375 mins.

To wrap this up... If you enjoy Ranma, then you need to add this beautiful little set to your collection, no doubt! If you enjoy anime, do it!",1293926400,,2385,4.329596412556054
