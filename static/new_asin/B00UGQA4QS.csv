7039205,5,B00UGQA4QS,"Let me just say that this busy career girl desperately needed this DVD. I make one of Jeff's recipes on a Sunday in 30 minutes and I swear it lasts me the entire work week! Jeff not only shares specific recipes, but shares his tips for building your pantry to quickly throw a hearty meal together. It's extremely healthy and lost cost. I use organics and apply his concepts and I still come under my grocery budget! The varieties are endless... Regarding a DVD versus reading a traditional recipe book-- if you are a visual learner, you will find that you remember his concepts because you watched him do it. The DVD is a little repetitive, but it's several months since I have watched it and I still remember everything. Thank you Jeff for helping me improve my health!",1323820800,22,770,4.546762589928058
7039206,1,B00UGQA4QS,"I purchased this DVD in hopes of learning how to put together delicious nutritious meals, fast.  What I got was what looks like a (poorly made) home video of basically one recipe repeated 5 times.  Throwing a few canned and frozen ingredients in a pot and just heating it up is not cooking.  Nor does it give the dish any flavor.  The recipes all taste awful.  If you eat crap food to begin with and don't have any taste buds, then you might like this DVD but otherwise, all the recipes taste like warmed up V8 juice.  Maybe if a little bit of olive oil (which won't kill anybody) was added (along with salt, which Jeff says can be added) and if the food was actually allowed to cook properly, maybe half an hour, to allow all the flavors to blend together, then maybe these recipes might be edible.  Otherwise, save your money.  And what's with the two girls (his neices I'm assuming) ooohing and awwwing every 5 minutes?  Very annoying!",1321747200,28,938,4.43859649122807
7039207,2,B00UGQA4QS,"I wondered why this wasn't offered as a cookbook instead of a DVD. Since I don't have a lot of time to make dinner, I also don't have time to watch a 2 hour DVD.  Now I know why it's not a cookbook.  There are 5 main meal recipes, a few smoothie and side dish recipes plus the principle that if you use his 5 basic ingredients, you can make a wide variety of dishes. I'm not a cook. I don't make up my own recipes nor do I want to.  This video was a waste of money; I am not at all pleased.",1301356800,27,490,3.6923076923076925
7039208,5,B00UGQA4QS,"I probably have 20 video's on healthy eating and this is the best one I've seen.  My wife and I live in the Bahamas and have watched it twice. I also printed out the recipes. We went down and bought a two Month supply of food for $240 (Bahama prices which is higher than the States).  We love to eat this way and whats great about it, everything is ready in 10 Min. and healthy.

7039209,4,B00UGQA4QS,"Pros: The recipes are simple and easy. Jeff Novick shows how to make lunch or dinner meals, plus a few other breakfast and dessert items. Sometimes the camera moves to an odd angle, but the overall presentation is very good. Jeff explains how he came up with these recipes and presents his extensive background in nutrition and cooking. Having young children help in the kitchen shows how easy these recipes really are.
Cons: Most of the meals are too similar, although our family enjoyed eating all of them. Using a different base for some of the recipes might help with providing more variety. Jeff's assistants sometimes make rather innocent, although distracting comments.",1289260800,41,676,5.044642857142857
7039210,3,B00UGQA4QS,"I have been trying to embrace the vegan lifestyle and thought this would be a good start but I was a little disappointed.  For those who are already vegetarian/vegan, this may be a great dvd for you, but I tried 4 of the recipes so far and have not cared for any of them.  My family (carnivores) really disliked it.

The recipes are very simple and you can get a dinner prepared in about 10 minutes so I will say from that aspect it was good.  I'm just not a fan of some of the spices used I guess.  Additionally, every recipe (for main dinner) uses a tomato sauce base, either whole canned tomatoes or chopped tomatoes or tomato puree so I didn't care for that.",1287878400,33,662,4.222222222222222
7039211,5,B00UGQA4QS,"Cooking healthy food is cheaper, faster, and easier than buying drive-thru fast food.

""Shopping the grocery store perimeter"" is just one option. Canned, frozen, bottled, and packaged foods can be a delightful component of a whole-foods plant-based diet.

Recipes are history. There are only ingredients and proportions - and all proportions are ""to taste.""

Salt and sugar are not necessary to produce good taste.

These are some of the surprising themes Jeff Novick demonstrates in his Fast Food DVD. Food purists may at first be shocked, but Jeff demonstrates how to construct healthy and tasty whole-food meals using ingredients from a can, freezer, bottle, or package. He uses familiar foods generally available in grocery stores. He uses tools and equipment everyone is likely to have in their kitchen. Each meal takes about 15 minutes or less to prepare and cook. He estimates that the food ingredients he uses cost about $4 per person per day. He makes a convincing case that healthy and tasty whole-food meals are cheaper, faster, and easier than buying fast foods at a drive-thru.

On a separate included CD, you get a printable pdf version of all the recipes he creates. But he makes clear that ""recipes"" should never interfere with your own creativity. Vary all ingredients and proportions to your taste.

If it matters to you, all of his recipes are sugar, salt, and soy free.

This DVD is a mind-opening adventure for whole-food advocates. Jeff points out that whole foods can retain their nutrition and flavor even when canned, frozen, bottled, or packaged. Check food labels to be sure you are getting just the food you want, and not a bunch of unwanted ingredients and unrecognizable chemicals.

I had only a few minor quibbles with Jeff's presentation. In a few demonstrations, he uses a steel bladed knife to cut whole tomatoes while they are in his cooking pot. That technique will dull your knife blades and scratch your pots. Instead, use a plastic knife to cut the tomatoes while they are still in their can, or just buy diced tomatoes. He also regularly tosses the water from the salt-free cans of beans he uses. That looks like a waste of good broth to me.

Those quibbles don't affect Jeff's overall outstanding presentation. He shows whole-food advocates that modern food packaging techniques can fit in perfectly well with their food choices. He combines ""cheap, fast, easy, healthy, and tasty"" themes in a way perfectly suited to modern lifestyles. That's all quite an accomplishment.

Fantastic.  5 ingredients.  10 minutes.  Nutritionally balanced.  He has several basic recipes and you make them how you like them.  He gives you numerous variations to get you started.

7039222,4,B00UGQA4QS,"For people with limited time and modest cooking skills, this video provides a simple foundation for healthy meals. Each meal has a balanced compliment of whole grains, legumes and vegetables and provides the main course for a healthy dinner. While there is a need to add berries and other fruits as well as seeds and nuts in limited portions to provide a more balanced nutritional foundation, the speed and ease with which you are able to prepare these meals gives you plenty of time to branch out to include other foods.
As for flavor, most of the meals are lightly seasoned and the flavors are mild, but he encourages you to experiment and season them more to your own personal taste. If you are new to salt free eating, it will take a while to get used to and you may want to add a little salt in the beginning until you are able to make the adjustment, but you will learn to appreciate the milder, more natural flavors over time and reap the health benefits.
In my opinion this is one of the easiest and quickest ways to provide the core of a healthy diet. The four stars is because it is not a complete foundation. The Global Burden of Disease Study, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation shows proof that increasing the amount of fruit in your diet is the biggest factor in living a longer healthier life.",1453766400,5,1321,4.462809917355372

The bonus is that each meal costs WAY less than any fast food restaurant you could name. He uses only foods that can be purchased at a regular grocery store.

Older kids, college kids, people who say they ""can't cook"" and those who are just busy can all do this. Best of all, this is the kind of food preparation information that everyone needs because this is healthy food that fills you up, is good for you, and will help you lose weight. All of this with no compromise in flavor or limiting portions. If you want to keep it simple, this is the one DVD you need. Make your kids and your spouse watch it so they can learn to make dinner when you aren't around.

7039253,5,B00UGQA4QS,"I am newly converted to the concept of low fat, plant based eating. After watching Forks Over Knives and after reading The Starch Solution - I had all the WHY information I needed to change the way I eat and the way I feed my family. I even had a bunch of recipes since I bought quite a few useful cookbooks. I found that the problem was my menu planning, shopping, and cooking was just too complex to make the change consistent.

I am so glad I found these videos by Jeff Novick. I bought all three of the Fast Food series. This one is the one that made the biggest difference and finally made the low-fat, plant based eating a reality for me and my family.

I make the dinners in big enough batches that they are available for lunch the next day. I also start most of my mornings off with his fruity oatmeal and make that in a double batch as well. I like it hot with some light soy milk for breakfast and then I have a little bit later in the evening cold a bit like a dessert crumble. I also keep a bunch of the burgers from the Fast Food 2 video and salad fixings and cut up vegetables in the fridge so that is another option for lunch the next day.  I also keep a veggie rich soup in the fridge as well.

What felt so different and complex now is so easy. My total meal prep time for the day including cooking is 20 minutes all day long. Breakfast, 5 minutes and my personal dessert is already made now. Dinner is five minutes for prep and to get water boiling and 10 minutes cooking and lunches are already made. The only day I cook more than that is once a week I throw together a pot of soup to keep in the fridge for any meal alternatives. (Although the burgers do add 10 minutes time to meal prep since they sit in the fridge for 10 minutes before cooking.) Also, it only takes me about 2 minutes max to clean up my kitchen when my meals are made.

I am convinced that these DVDs are the reason I was able to successfully make the change to eating and cooking healthy 7 days a week. I have recommended them to my sister and to my mother who are also trying to eat plant based.",1359417600,55,2087,4.068126520681266

I highly recommend this DVD!",1347062400,9,786,4.542253521126761
7039258,1,B00UGQA4QS,"In this video Jeff takes to hours of your life away to talk down to you about how to open cans & cut bags. There are less than 10 recipes with names like: Pasta Primavera! ( yes, he uses the exclamation point. No that doesn't make it taste better or more creative.) or Mexican Fiesta. Really? Here, let me save you $24: dump a can of tomatoes, a can of beans, a bag of frozen veggies and some spices in a pot and serve it over brown rice or wheat pasta and you have made ALL of the recipes in this video. Oh, you want variety? Just change the types of veggies, beans and spices and supposedly you have a whole new meal! Genius, right?? Ya, I didn't think so either. Really really disapointed. Total waste of money.",1343433600,31,714,4.181159420289855
7039259,5,B00UGQA4QS,"I love this new way of cooking! And guess what? I'm not the only one doing it. Jeff Novick, one of the nutrition medicine gurus, made a fun video teaching several dishes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, and dessert. They are
amazingly similar to the ones I've been inventing lately. I highly recommend the DVD, Fast Food Volume One. It would be a terrific homeschool homearts class especially because it features two cute homeschooled sisters. It has given me oodles of ideas.

I only have two problems with it. First, he is a very messy cook. Second the girls double dip. I know these are trivial to some, but I am a neatness and germ freak. If this had been my video, I would have made sure only the proper things for each meal were out, that dips were served in individual portions, that the garbage can was empty before beginning to shoot, that the sink was filled with hot, soapy water to allow cleaning as you go, and the girls would have done everything with Jeff supervising. But, hey, he's making money selling videos, and I'm only buying them.

My husband saw the trailer for volume two, burgers and fries and insisted we buy it. It will arrive Thursday.",1338854400,9,1168,4.557142857142857
7039260,5,B00UGQA4QS,"Easy recipes and a fun, encouraging approach.  and of since it's Jeff Novick, the nutritional value is outstanding and based on scientific fact, not fads.",1337472000,5,154,5.16
7039261,5,B00UGQA4QS,"Jeff Novick's Fast Food DVD is simply AWESOME!!!  I got it because I follow the McDougall plan and I needed fast and easy ways to make on-plan meals.  This DVD MORE than delivers--to the point where I almost never maky anything BUT ""Fast Food"" meals anymore.  What's great is that there are really no recipes--once you learn the basics, you can create whatever you like with whatever you have on hand.  I can toss a meal together in 10 minutes no matter what b/c I always keep canned no-salt-added beans and tomatoes, rice, and frozen veggies on hand. It really is that easy.

Jeff's Longevity Soup is my favorite ""recipe."" I've never made it the same way twice and I've never not completely enjoyed what I made.  I make huge vats of it and then eat it for a solid week.

I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. It really is that useful!",1337126400,12,839,4.444444444444445
8706481,1,B00UGQA4QS,"If you are already a vegetarian or vegan, you may find this DVD and the others in the series helpful. I am new to this type of diet. I downloaded the pdf and watched the entire DVD. What is shown on the DVD is very different on the pdf. The names of many of the dishes are different, sometimes the pdf has ingredients not on the DVD and visa versa, the amounts to measured are also different and I found myself constantly writing the corrections on the pdf. Jeff also has two assistants, twin teenage girls, that I am guessing are either vegan or vegetarian. I say this because of they way they look and how they react to tasting each prepared meal.. The girls are unusually thin, One of the girls wears a sleeveless top exposing her arms that are extremely thin. It's hard not to look at them. I prepared the meal I thought I would like the best, the potato cauliflower curry, and I thought it tasted awful. Really awful. Again. if you're already a vegan or vegetarian, you may like this DVD. Remember to write the recipe corrections.",1527552000,,1035,4.395833333333333

Enough! I found my solution. Novick R.D. will teach you how to make a big pot for the week in 10 minutes (no kidding! 12 minutes tops! I timed it!). You can cook a grain while you make the delicious stew or buy ready-made frozen grains and you're set for the week!  I also buy my groceries online. I created a fixed list for every week cooking and it's click and go! I'm 12 pounds lighter in 20 days! Crazy good stuff! Buy it might save your health.
