704440,5,6303686834,"Yes it would if we could get Hollywood to produce films that are timelessly fresh as the great ""Shampoo"".

 Warren Beatty is unforgettable as George, a shameless womanizing cad of a hairdresser, who effortlessly beds every woman that crosses his path.  They usually do that at his salon, as they all wait for George to ""Do"" them, in more ways than one!

George naturally has several girlfriends who he tries to keep from knowing about the others, but of course they all find out.  Goldie Hawn is just adorable here in her little velvet brown baby doll dress, and exudes a helpless little girl type charm from every pore.  She lives with George, when he's not with various others.  Lee Grant is his married lover, whose husband Jack Warden is the patsy.  He plays his role quite sympathetically.  There is Julie Christie as the girl who George really wants, and the only one who doesn't want him.  Now that IS realistic cinema.  There are other quickies of course.  A not to be missed young Carrie Fisher scores some real ""Love"" between tennis lessons before her mom gets ""done"" by George when she arrives home, and finds her daughter took her appointment! George goes about his day to day activities, without a hair out of place, no matter how often, or how many women try to seduce him.  A drunken Lee Grant creates a memorable scene when she visits George under a table they are seated at with several other people.  For more, YOU need to watch!

What is interesting here, besides the wonderful flavor and mood of the late sixties captured in the music, free love attitudes, fashions and mod ambience, is that it took place in 1968 and was released in 1975.  It covers the election eve of 1968, the whole start of the Nixon era, released at the end of the  Watergate era.  Maybe that can be called dated now, but it gives you a real flavor of what the world of politics and attitudes were.  It is interesting and very unusual to see a film that is set in a time period, so close to the actual era that just preceded it.  There is less than a decade between the 1968 era theme,  and the films release in 1975.  For this reason, it was perfect for it's day, and in my opinion remains so today.

There are way too many wonderful moments to list here.  If you haven't seen this film, you are truly missing a classic piece of what made the late sixties and mid seventies so special.  If you didn't live it, here is a film that will give you a great vcarious feeling that you did.",1041638400,16,2476,4.424778761061947

704442,5,6303686834,"Hal Ashby's Shampoo is a wickedly funny satire of the hedoism of the sexual revolution of the 1960's and 70's and the big hangover our nation experienced when the party finally ended. Warren Beatty is wonderful as George, the bed hopping hair dresser who seems to do his thinking with something other then his brain. Kudos, also for Goldie Hawn and Julie Christie in supporting roles that really matter. Look for a teenage Carrie Fisher in a hilarious one on one with Beatty. This movie is best summed up in a line of dialogue from the Hawn character, who tells the itinerant hair dresser, ""you know your always running around to someplace, but you never seem to get anywhere"".",983750400,3,677,4.697478991596639
704620,5,6303686834,"For those wanting to remember what pre-Star Wars Hollywood was like, this set is just about perfection. All three of the movies show significant dating and unintentional humor, and are all the better for it. The filmmakers trying to be relevant and fashionable means that this was an inevitable consequence. Therefore, the silly ending of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice is not only appropriate, but perfect. The neo-giallo world of Eyes of Laura Mars is stunning in its casual use of real NYC locations, so preferable to the fax Toronto we have gotten too used to. And, finally, Shampoo is at once frustratingly pretentious and disarmingly comedic, with grapplings of early feminism battling against what was thought to be insightful political theater.",1499904000,,747,5.032258064516129

704624,4,6303686834,"After the sad passing of Carrie Fisher we wanted to see all her films. Somehow I never caught Shampoo in 40+ years on cable TV. I found a DVD copy, the transfer was OK although the colors were very washed out.
Shampoo is a bit of a slow mover, but still entertaining. The cast has a parade of celebrities from the early 1970's like Lee Grant, Goldie Hawn, Julie Christie, Jack Warden etc. Carrie Fisher has a small  role as the teenage daughter of Jack Warden.
The movie is set in 1968, yet it has a 70's vibe to it filled with LA hipsters smoking weed in hot tubs and sexual promiscuity.
Dont take Shampoo too seriously. It's a fun romp through the late 60s/mid 1970s with an outstanding cast.

704629,4,6303686834,"Co-written by Warren Beatty (who stars as the hairdresser stud) and directed by Hal Ashby, this film has dated in some ways but remains fresh in others given that the many female characters are  single-minded, liberated and determined to get what they want. Unfortunately almost none of the characters - male or female - is very appealing. Most are selfish, devious and greedy. not to mention shallow. Only Goldie Hawn's character Jill  appears to have a kind heart but she also comes across as weak, dependent and boring  -  not to mention stupid. Julie Christie, Lee Grant, Carrie Fisher and Jack Warden all play highly flawed people: only young Carrie's character Lorna evokes any sympathy, perhaps because she is so young and maladjusted.. A catchy Beatles soundtrack and lots of bed-hopping does not alter the fact that at the finale the viewer feels empty and depressed. Perhaps that was the intention. Low self esteem, loneliness, vapidity and desperation are the characteristics of these Shampoo Wives, Husbands and Singles..",1486944000,,1033,5.130952380952381

704796,5,6303686834,"Bought yrs ago...1st thing...you throw away ""Bob & Carol & whatever"".  Garbage.  Now we've got a magnificent portrait of CA life in the late '60s.  ""Shampoo"" begins w/ ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" by the Beach Boys in the background & it only gets better w/Paul Simon's tunes & Warren w/his ladies all at the top of their game.  Also it's Carrie Fisher's exceptional screen debut...may she RIP or simply continue to rock on w/her mama in Heaven.  Everyone has an agenda in this film & all the more interesting when it's an election year.  If I were Jackie...dumb enough to stay w/George while knowing the wise decision was Lester.

"" Eyes of Laura Mars"" is ever so watchable if you like pretty things to look at.  Isn't that what fashion's all about?  Faye/her clothes & apartment...Wow!  The pretty models she photographs so well are a delight.  Even Tommy Lee Jones looks incredibly handsome & well dressed for a NY City police detective i.e. no doubt the best he looked in any of his many films.

The big hair is worth seeing, fun to see these actors still young.  There are some decent dialogue moments with Beatty and his co-actors, but the script in general kills whatever this story is supposed to be.  Billed as a send-up, comes off more as a tribute.  And oddly, this '75 movie is set on Election Night in '68, without much reason given as to why.  Yet the big hair-styles and the me-me-me mindsets and lifestyles seem to be clearly in the mid-70s.

With Trump in the news, the movie also comes across as politically incorrect.  Is this Warren Beaty's confession about how many women he bedded and how hectic his life was?

704888,3,6303686834,"""Shampoo"" is an enjoyable movie that seems to be mostly a light comedic romp.  Most of the people depicted seem to be unhappy and in some form of crisis.  Personally, I think the most enjoyable aspect of this movie at this time is the ""time capsule"" aspect of it.  The movie was shot in the mid 1970s and set in the late 1960s.  It is fun to see the stars from that time and landscape, vehicles, etc...  Goldie Hawn co stars in the movie and I felt she was excellent.  Lee Grant was also in the movie and was awarded an Oscar.

Other that the movie did not mean much to me.  It is the sort of movie I like to watch when I am too tired to think.  I have come to respect Warren Beatty as an artist.  I think he does a good job in this movie, but I don't feel the movie really has a point.  Warren Beatty appears to me to be a serious artist, playing a light weight person.

704890,4,6303686834,"This is a fun collection for the most part.  BCTA is a classic of the 1960s, when California was a center of affluent experimentation in sexuality, spiritualism, and work.  I saw it as a youth and was fascinated with its frank portrayal of the marriages of a group of friends, where fidelity, commitment, and love are tested.  This alone is worth the price of admission.

Shampoo is a 70s classic, in which the glorious culture of 60s California is replaced with hedonism, celebrity culture, and greed.  It is quite brilliant, with Beatty at his very best as a superficial and awful man whose life is out of control.  The acting is brilliant, including Carrie Fischer's first film appearance.

Why they tacked on the third film, Eyes, is beyond me.  It is supposed to be a thriller, but simply doesn't work and ends in the stupidest of cliches.

705178,5,6303686834,"""Shampoo"" is -for me- one of the best movies of the 1970's, that great 'decade under the influence', when even major American studios were mostly making high profile, personal movies, with great dialogue and elaborated scripts, directed by incredibly talented and unique directors, and produced with a distinguished handsome class, delivering movies that were just fantastic, because they were more about ""the people"" and about life and its path, than about grand, but viciously empty special effects, or all too the same, comic's books' adaptions, and, dreary, never ending sequels as we get today for the most part. This one was by excellence a famous box office hit, and, also a complex film, in a way, so layered with an elegant and yet realistic tone, handling so perfectly the sexy, controversial, political, and, social material, while being essentially a wildly entertaining sophisticated dark comedy. It tells about the lives of people used to their status and privilege, and of those around them, making fireworks with a solid script, written by its star, savvy producer, and outstanding filmmaker, Warren Beatty, and, by a Robert Towne, who was at the time, after having penned another great movie such as Polanski's ""Chinatown"", one of the hottest screen writers in town, certainly knowing very well, not only the concept but also all the developments of a scenario that always rings true, as also as directed with great style, and psychological finesse, and attention to details, by a master, the awesome Hal Ashby. The movie is just sparkling with a sizzling cast of stars in top shape:  from Lee Grant, hilariously bitter as the cleverly infuriated matrona Felicia, to a Jack Warden playing billionaire and man of honor, Lester Cowan,and, delivering possibly his best performance ever,  in a motion picture, and let's not forget Goldie Hawn, amusingly nailing down her character of neurotic upcoming Hollywood's actress who's also one of those madly in love with their hairdresser, who is an incurable dreamer and Don Juan, a Lothario of the late 1960's, who gloriously rules the town, but, might be up for the overly due moral lesson needed, over a couple of extremely crucial and very busy days (and nights) in prime Beverly Hills, culminating over the evening of Election's eve 1968, with Nixon being elected at the power, while a never so well depicted west Los Angeles, and its pathetically wealthy and  flawed crowd is misbehaving and living the very fast lane, with a back drop so properly and lovingly reproduced that makes you think of a modern Sodom and Gomorrah, but that nails down the town, as good as only very few movies ever have! There's also Tony Bill, quite controlled, and toned down as a filmmaker trying to bring on some integrity to the mix,  and, Carrie Fisher, making of a small role, a very important, and defining appearance, perfectly rendering her unhappy and lustful young heiress type. But, i believe that, over all,  who clearly steals the show here, it is a formidable Julie Christie, looking as radiant as ever, making of her high profile, spoiled mistress role, one classic character in Films: she is glacial as she is on fire, sharp and carefree, jaded ,and outrageously beautiful and damned, a lifetime's role and performance, that enhances the material to the top, molding a classic piece of work, thanks also to a fantastic makeover complete of a fabulous platinum hairdo, and, of the most daring and chic high fashion wardrobe worn with noble nonchalance: her performance is stellar here, and always makes the movie shines anytime she is in, conveying also with intensity toward the end, after a roller coaster of events, a very special turn of bitter sweet romance,  that is key to the success of the narration, and to the transformation, and, perhaps ""growth"" and redemption of our vain, cheating, and, ambitious protagonist who learns it the hard way, unmercifully, in the cold lights of the day. He's definitely commanded by a never so buff and handsome, Warren Beatty, indeed in a state of pure grace, bringing to life his playboy/Beverly Hills hairdresser's role, with gusto and charming recklessness, truly deserving of the real major movie star's turn. The chemistry between him, and Christie, is also intoxicating and sensual, driving everyone wild, and not only during that infamous dinner party's scene, other great cinematic moment, and, memorable comical achievement, acted with all the perfect timing, and more, and, at the same time, telling us quite a lot, about that society and that time, in a fashion that goes way beyond the comedy of manners, reaching high momentum, in what is a great and perfectly structured, wonderfully designed movie, as we -sadly- hardly even ever see anymore. And, that's also possibly why ""Shampoo"" is not only funny and insightful, but, grows, and keeps on growing on you, with its own characters, and, its pitch perfect tale of morality, that ultimately delivers the goods with a nostalgic, consistent tone, deconstructing cliches, and feelings with cleverness, and that style, you'd see so magnificently orchestrated as it is, only in the best Hollywood's movies, and so ""Shampoo"" is definitely one of them, brilliantly passing also the test of time, i must add.",1441584000,9,5266,5.061059907834101

He co wrote the script and directed and I don't think he ever got enough credit for this piece, although it was popular at the time. This was Carrie Fisher's debut acting experience and I see how much talent she had way back when. If she had been able to pull it together she might have had an incredible acting career, but she had other issues. I think the comic edge of the writing coupled with the great timing of the acting is superb. There are poignant moments as well.

It's certainly funny, and it has moments of real sadness, insight and sharp edged political satire.  The way these upscale, self-involved Los Angelenos of
1968 partake of the free-love freedom of the 60s, but lose the associated political consciousness - completely ignoring Nixon's impending election -  is a valid an interesting observation (albeit one the film kind of beats to death).

But the story of George, an uber-hip promiscuous hairdresser, and his assorted bedmates never quite feels like it has the depth it pretends to, nor is it as funny as it wants to be.

Beatty is good playing a send up of his own image, but I felt so aware that he was doing exactly that, that it sort of took me out of the film.  He also makes George SO shallow, that while I could enjoy his adventures, and feel pity for the sadness underneath, I never could feel emotionally touched at how lost he really is.  Julie Christie, Lee Grant, and Goldie Hawn are all very good, although each woman comes dangerously close to portraying a caricature.

His character is so passive, even in the love scenes, it's hard to see how or why he was a sex symbol (in this film at least). Maybe it's a you had to be there 70s sort of film. But is it a satire? Is it a morality play of sorts played out in decadent 60s L.A.? Or is it a comedy? Honest to god, I don't know WHAT this film is in the end and I think the main reason for this is that IT doesn't know either.

705702,5,6303686834,"I always wonder, when I look at old films that I once liked a lot, whether they will hold up in time.  I really don't remember any strong my reaction to Shampoo, which I saw shortly after it came out.  I think I enjoyed it but dismissed it as kind of silly.

Now I think I enjoyed it a lot more.  The script is very smart and manages to be both hilarious and serious.  The cast is stellar in every sense of the word:  Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn, both at the height of their physical beauty (although they have both aged remarkably well) are a sheer delight just to look at.  Warren is awesome, as always, despite the most ridiculous hairdo ever to be plopped on the head of a leading man. (With the possible exception of Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking.)  Lee Grant gives one of her  many sensational performances, Jack Gilbert takes what could have been a stock character and gives an added dimension to it, and Carrie Fisher shows her intelligence and presence in her first film appearance.

Others here have likened the film to French sex farces and there is certainly an aspect of that, which gives us the hilarity.  It is so much more, though...a comment on the times, a perceptive picture of an obsessed Casanova (without dwelling too much on the psychological wierdness of it).  It's greatly entertaining, with the costumes, the parties and the many, many great scenes.  The scene with Warren and Julie in the bathroom, as he does her hair, is hot, hot, hot.  There were certainly sparks flying between them in those days.  It looked like they had all they could do to keep in character.  The scene where she disappears under the table in the restaurant is also hilarious.

Yes, it's definitely a film of its time.  I recently saw Blow Up again, Antonioni's film which portrayed the London version of the same swinging 60's.  It captivated me the time it came out, but bored me now. But Shampoo, which was not as highly regarded as BlowUp strikes me as a film which will endure for a long time.  Warren Beatty is one of those people whose glamour and great looks hides the fact from many that he is one highly perception and intelligent person.  He knows how to make a smart social commentary that is also great fun.",1218240000,2,2225,4.485074626865671

Why would it have been difficult to make the wardrobe consistently 60s--and what better expert on what 1968 should look like than Goldie Hawn, a co-star in the film?  They got cars and women's skirts  right, but most of the male clothing (including bizarro, button-pocket jacket-shirts) and accessories (giant, translucent sunglasses, e.g.), and male hair (Beatty's semi-believable Morrison-quoif excluded), and some  of the women's clothes, e.g.,  Julie Christie's pants outfits, scream ""spring of 1975.""  The Shampoo production people forgot that 1968 fashions looked a heck of a lot more like the mid 60s than the mid 70s.  I am sure they were blind to this at the time--it can be hard to recognize the ""historical"" quality of one's current haircut or clothing.  But the hair knows.

Of course Felicia's husband Lester (Jack Warden) is having a fling with Jackie as well. The musical beds get as complicated as a John Updike novel. COUPLES comes to mind.

Beatty, Hawn, Christie, Warden and Grant give hilarious good performances in this satire of the sexual excesses of the late 1960's and the politics of Nixon et al.

Warren Beatty plays George Roundy a Las Angeles hairdresser who yearns for his own salon and becomes entangled in the lives of four different women and the man who is somehow connected to all of them. In order to get his loan George approaches businessman Lester Carp (Jack Warden). The problem is that George is sleeping with Lester's wife Felicia (Lee Grant), Lester's girlfriend Jackie (Julie Christie) and Lester's daughter Lorna (Carrie Fisher). George is also in the middle of a failing relationship with his own girlfriend Jill(Goldie Hawn). The confusion results in a sex comedy that AFI considers  one of the 100 most funny but the movie has lost quite a bit of its edge over the years.

The disc I viewed was bare bones with no extras. Columbia's transfer was kind of grainy and soft and the mono sound while adequate  to the souce material was a little tinny. Watch it as a piece of 1970's nostalgia and as a classic but don't expect greatness.",1203033600,,1116,4.707692307692308

Beatty plays George Roundy, a not entirely bright but nimble hairdresser on a motorcycle who is much beloved and desired by woman.  The women doing most of the desiring are Lee Grant (Felicia), Julie Christie (Jackie), and Goldie Hawn (Jill).  Jack Warden plays Lester a successful investor who, to his chagrin and ultimate amusement, learns that his wife, his mistress, and his daughter Lorna (Carrie Fisher) are being bedded by the guy he thinks is gay.  (Shades of the sham eunuch in the harem!)

This is a premise that many in the Hollywood Hills could not resist, the irony cutting so beautifully through the canyons and swimming pools and the lavish parties.  Most of the action takes place on that November day in 1968 when Nixon and Agnew were swept into the White House by the ""silent majority.""  Lester and his friends are quite pleased and are celebrating as the election returns come in.  Meanwhile George is trying to raise money so he can open his own shop since he's got the ""heads.""  Keeping the heads though turns out to be more than he can handle--and to be honest jumping from bed to bed several times a day with several different women might be too much for any man.

Will Georgie-Porgie, puddin' pie (who kissed the girls and made them cry) get the money for his shop and the girl he loves--and which girl is it, that he loves?  Goldie Hawn wears a micro-mini (but there's no peeking!) and Julie Christie sports a short pony skirt with boots while Lee Grant has to play the eldest woman.  Now, who gets George and would she really want him?

Some nice sixties/seventies Hollywood decadence graces the screen along with free love and don't bogart that number.  In the background there are a lot of mug shots of Nixon and Agnew in juxtaposition as a kind of joke since the movie was made in 1975 not long after Watergate.

Beatty, playing a role said to be patterned after makeup artist Jay Sebring, is competent and wins our sympathy, maybe because we know he's never going to amount to much.  Or does he?  Lee Grant won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress, but to be honest I thought Julie Christie was better, although they both were good.  Actors carried this with Warden and Hawn also putting in strong performances.

Shampoo is not so much funny as it is amusing.  It's like a superior sit-com without the laugh track, but in no way is it a ""defining"" Hollywood film.

WHile much is said about the historical place of this film; its worth noting that the film has a timeless quality - it does a brilliant job of dealing with love, lust, realtionships, overlapping relationships, trust, human nature, the meaning of life etc.  In the same way classic greek and roman comedies show that as things change things stay the same.",1177891200,5,809,5.052631578947368
705776,5,6303686834,"""Shampoo"" is probably the most sophisticated sex comedy ever made in this country. It's a very clear-eyed (and very funny) look at how love and lust get inextricably mixed up with up with power, money, position, and politics. Of course, contrary to almost every critique posted here, George (Warren Beatty), the philandering Beverly Hills hairdresser, is the primary victim of the rules of the game, late-60s Southern California-style. Unlike the protagonist of the great Renoir movie, George doesn't end up dead, but he's left alone, abandoned by all the women he's bedded, looking like a naive fool. And that's George's sin--he's an uncynical romantic in a world that doesn't know the difference between felt emotion and deliberate calculation. He sleeps with women because he genuinely likes them. For him, taking a woman to bed is an extension of doing her hair--it's an intimate act in which he makes her look and feel better. All the other characters in the movie use sex as part of a larger plan--they each have some separate goal on their mind, which they achieve in one way or another, and George is left behind with his silly emotional and sexual vulnerabiliy. He's Don Giovanni in reverse--the boy who can't say no because he actually gives a damn--and he pays a steep price for his availability. Playing a slightly out of it dupe, Beatty has never been better or more dazzlingly glamorous. And he's surrounded by a flawless ensemble cast--Lee Grant is simply astonishing as a deceived and deceiving Beverly Hills matron, and Julie Christie, in her flared pants and mini skirts, is peerlessy sexy as the 1968 version of a Rodeo Drive courtesan. Thanks to Robert Towne,  ""Shampoo"" also has some of the most natural, unforced, yet revealing dialog ever heard in an American movie--nothing is stylized or italicized, but every nonchalant remark hits target like a polished Wilde epigram.

705777,5,6303686834,"SHAMPOO harks back to the glory days of Hollywood to the famous incident at Ciro's (the night club) when Paulette Goddard added spice to her career by slipping under a table to give an evening's worth of excitement to director Anatole Litvak, thereby sealing her reputation as a party girl who really didn't care what anyone thought.  (In another version of the story, Goddard and Litvak both vanished under the table simultaneously and had sex on the nightclub floor on the feet of their friends.)  In any case, SHAMPOO recalls this incident by having Julie Christie slide out of her banquette to take care of the hairdresser, George Roundy (played by Warren Beatty) even though her ""boyfriend"" (Jack Warden) is hovering dangerously close by.

SHAMPOO also takes its cues from British Restoration comedy like Wycherley and Congreve, a world of cuckolded gentlemen, odious bourgeoisie, discontented wives, and boys on the make, re-locating the center of the gilded universe from London to Los Angeles in the late 1960s.  As in Congreve, the husbands believe it's safe to leave their wives and daughters alone with George because he's a dandy/aesthete/hairdresser.  That suits him down to the ground, for on the bodies of these ignorant women he can have his revenge on the men who treat him as a tradesman, a social inferior.  The picture has a slightly dated air, as if to say, we're different now than when the action of this film is laid, which might be difficult to apprehend today.

Beatty is fine, though his haircut doesn't recall the 1960s as much as the mid 70s when the film was produced.  As the typically 60s sex objects George dallies with, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn are perfectly cast, almost too perfectly, they hardly seem to be acting at all; their haircuts and their clothes set the scene and call ""cut"" at the end of each take.  Kathryn Blondell, the insanely talented Hollywood hairdresser, did the real hair work here, at the beginning of a long career which has included just about every movie Goldie Hawn has done since (Kate Hudson too!), as well as such period pieces as APOLLO 13 and BIRD.  She is the master at making women look great on screen, and not just leading ladies, but supporting players and extras too.  But this might be her best work-other than the futuristic styles she gave to Paul Verhoeven's STARSHIP TROOPERS.",1129766400,22,2359,4.843283582089552
705778,3,6303686834,"The main reason why guys liked Shampoo is because they wanted to live the life that Warren Beatty was living.

Even the star of the hairstyle reality show Blow Out (Jonathan Antin) said that Shampoo was his inspiration to become a stylist.

How many other Warren Wannabees followed along that same path?

Too many, I'm sure!

But, today it's not  really that hard to live the life of the character in Shampoo, if you have just a little game.

Don't get me wrong, Warren does look good, but his motorcycle is stale and his hair is ridiculous.

Plus, the females that Warren's character was bagging are either not that fine or too old.

I mean Carrie Fisher looked OK in no bra and whatever age she was at the time, but hardly a total hottie.

Goldie Hawn, probably the cutest one of his conquests, is a relic of the 60's, a whiny pain for the most part and nowhere near as fine as her daughter Kate Hudson who is more the prototype of who's out there now for the taking.

And Lee Grant and Julie Christie were in their mid to late 30's! And back then girls in their 30's...looked like they were in their 30's!!!

So, right off the bat, you kind of lose your interest in 'being like Warren.' It's just not worth taking your chances on such so-so girls in this post-AIDS world.

Plus, the movie's  supposed 'shocking' scenes -

1) Where Carrie Fisher says ""I want to F____ you"" and

2) When Julie Christie says ""I want to s___ his c___""

are more embarassing than erotic. Call me crazy but low rent, trash-mouth, drunken lout chicks just don't turn me on like they used to.

Finally the movie's politics are a complete joke.

It's basically Hollywood liberals making making fun of the corrupt Nixon administration.

But Hollywood liberals, in fact liberals in general, lost ALL moral authority to decry corrupution in the Oval Office after they excused and sat on their hands during the FAR MORE corrupt Clinton administration.

And it's that sensibility...that smug leftist cockeyed view of the world that tried to juxtapose Warren's carnality with Nixon's corruption as a social political statement... that dates this movie more than anything.",1124582400,7,2142,4.661333333333333

705780,4,6303686834,"""Fair is foul, and foul is fair,"" say the Three Witches in _Macbeth_, and the principle holds true for the film _Shampoo_.  Released in 1975, and one of the leading members of what are now being called ""70s films,"" _Shampoo_ is the story of George Roundy, hairdresser in beautiful and sun-blessed City of Angels.  Perhaps no other film in Hollywood has been placed into more capable hands -- Hal Ashby, the remarkably disciplined but expressive director (as in Roundy's rides on his motorcycle through the Hollywood Hills); Robert Towne, veteran screenwriter who won an Oscar for _Chinatown_; and Warren Beatty, one of Hollywood's greats, and swordsman of renown.  The film follows Roundy as he enjoys what he seemingly enjoys most, the company of women, and as he seeks to start a business, his own hair salon.  But in the film, as the Three Witches say in _Macbeth_, fair is foul, and foul is fair -- which is to say that in _Shampoo_, roles reverse and appearances deceive.  Roles reverse in the central characteristic to Roundy -- his enjoying the company of women.  For in Roundy's world, the courter has changed to the courted, and the courted, the courter.  Why it is, or even whether it must be or ought to be is perhaps fit for another discussion -- but it seems hard to argue, to this reviewer, that the traditional role for a guy in courtship is to be the courter, and the traditional role for a woman, to be the courted.  In Roundy's world, however, things somehow have got reversed.  He does no courting -- he doesn't stop his movement seeing an angelic brunette walking down the sidewalk and chase her down, he doesn't time his exit from a bank to catch an arresting blonde on her way out.  He does no courting.  For it is women who court him.  He's walking into his shop and a woman slams on her brakes and bats her eyes for his attention, he's waiting for one of his ""friends"" (most likely how he'd introduce her to someone) at her house and, while he's killing time, her daughter comes on to him.  So in Roundy's world, things have got themselves reversed.  The cause of the reversal is significant and important to understanding Roundy.  Roundy's very existence is you might say ""half free-will"" -- half free-will because on nearly any matter, he is only forced to make half a decision.  For in constantly being courted, he is essentially being offered decisions for approval or rejection.  In being constantly sought-after, half of his decision-making process is completed for him.  His life is thus a whirlwind -- from an observer's point of view, he might be seen to do things in a roundabout fashion.  And so he ends up having sex with the young daughter, Lorna (played by Carrie Fisher), of one of his friends.  How does such a thing happen?  Because he's only ever forced to make half a decision.  And yet in Lorna's courting him, which she does with vigor, there is a lesson as well.  For she comes on to Roundy by saying, ""Wanna f---?""  And to this Roundy agrees.  However, when one of his friends courts him by indirectly asking him to fix her hair, he turns her down.  And so a lesson to be seen here, as well, is that as Roundy has a thousand and one offers at any one time, he takes the most direct and most clearly communicated.  Thus roles reverse in _Shampoo_.  But appearances deceive as well.  Perhaps appearances deceive in no better way in the film than in the manner that Roundy is forced to act in order to start his business.  For Roundy secretly has his own master whose altar he must kneel before -- the bank.  In seeking to start his own hair salon, he must do the courting.  He must go to a bank and apply for a loan.  It is he who is doing the approaching, it is he who conforms to the standards his master will demand of him.  Indeed, no longer is it one of his friends who is putting on just the right top or just the right perfume for Roundy's approval, but it is Roundy who is putting on just the right jacket and putting his raffish hair in just the right place for the approval of his master -- a bank manager.  Tellingly, he invites none of his friends along with him to the bank -- he's aware of his reversed role, and he doesn't like it, but there is nothing he can do about it.  Denied his first attempt at a loan, he must later go see another banker, Lester (played by Jack Warden).  Lester is the husband of one of Roundy's friends.  And here too appearances deceive -- for Lester believes Roundy to be gay, and so Lester would be quite shocked to learn that Roundy is enjoying the company of his wife.  And indeed appearances may so deceive in this world that the end is a deception itself.  For the end of _Shampoo_ is often seen as bleak and despairing -- Roundy in shock as the only person he decides he can trust, leaves him, and breaks his heart.  But is Roundy's heartbreak forever?  It's hard not to look a few months into the future and see Roundy motoring along Mulholland Drive on his motorcycle, a friend of his speeding up beside him in her car, flagging him down, smiling devilishly out of her car, asking him if he wants to f---, Roundy suppressing a smile, glancing around.  Glancing at what?  At nothing.  Roundy shrugging, and then Roundy off on his motorcycle tailing behind the girl in her car, having already mended, or if not mended, at least forgotten -- maybe! with hope! -- his heartbreak.",1064966400,3,5371,4.480452674897119
705781,5,6303686834,"Cheers to Johnny Depp, Sandra Bernhard, and Julianne Moore for citing this almost forgotten '70's classic as one of their all time favorites. To most, Shampoo is looked at as a Beatty vanity project, a dated box-office hit, or just dull and not worth your time. It's a shame because it's one of the best films of its time and is probably the last example of a sex comedy having any sly wit, sophistication, or style. The character of George (Warren Beatty) is based on Manson family victim Jay Sebring -a close friend of Beatty's- and his quest for maturity and respect cuts through the dozens of meaningless, in-your-face type comedies of today. No, it's not an overbearingly gross, laugh-'til-your-side-aches ride with lots of gratuitous nudity and forgettable one-note characters;  the film builds at a carefully constructed pace and -using humor as an undercurrent and beautifully soft neutral colors as its visual look -packs a slight emotional wallop at the end. It's as close to an American art film comedy as you're going to come.
The collaboration of screenwriter Robert Towne (Chinatown) and director Hal Ashby (Harold and Maude, The Last Detail, Coming Home) is a small dream and together they create some beautiful magic: the subtlety of Towne's very funny dialogue never becomes monotonous like a bad Broadway farce and Ashby's camera allows a viewer to discover hidden depths in Goldie Hawn, Carrie Fisher, Jack Warden (Oscar nominated), and Lee Grant (Oscar winner). All the performances are first rate but Julie Christie as George's true love interest steals the movie with those wonderfully expressive eyes and her classic drunk scene. (One of the best visual jokes in the movie is the backside of the black cocktail dress she wears at the election dinner.)

I owned the Criterion laserdisc version of Shampoo and saw a great print on the big screen but this digitally remastered DVD treatment is nothing short of fabulous. The visual look of Shampoo is very important since as the story gets deeper so do the colors (watch the scene where George cuts Jackie's hair in her bathroom while they both glow in the fading afternoon light) but you could never tell from the VHS tape copies or even on its scatter-shot television appearances. This transfer does the film justice but unfortunately there are no special features whatsoever. A making-of documentary or even a commentary track (with the exception of Jack Warden all the principal actors are still alive) would have made this edition a great feature in your library. It's still worth buying but also just a bit of a letdown. Regardless, you can view Shampoo as either a lumbering, relic-like snapshot of its time or a morality tale with depth, humor, and some class. A richly rewarding viewing experience awaits the viewer who sees the latter. Enjoy!",1043366400,61,2822,4.976694915254237
