8418566,2,B00486UTXK,"The service of Artiflix is good, but the quality of this DVD copy was very bad. It looks much like watching a 3-D program with no 3-D glasses. I couldn't watch very long. It hurt my eyes.

When I asked about picture quality before I purchased, I was told by Artiflix that they use the ""original source"" for their copies. This was NOT from any original source unless that source was a bad VHS copy.

Nice people, good service, not good viewing.  Waste of money.",1301788800,,460,4.3882352941176475
