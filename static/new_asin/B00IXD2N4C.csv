6302009,4,B00IXD2N4C,"Here's what makes the film good. The story is interesting, the acting is excellent, and the complexity is fascinating in the extreme. It was great seeing Liv Ullman in the role of the elderly Norwegian mother.

However, this movie required too much explanation and the point of view was weird. The only person who knew the truth was the protagonist. It would have been far more interesting if we knew the truth and she was discovering it. However, that would have been impossible considering that the protagonist knew everything. No one else who mattered had any idea what was going on.

I was not disappointed and am glad I watched the movie. I learned something about the long-term effects of World War II on the Norwegian people. And the acting was superb. My only recommendation is to watch this film with the internet readily available.",1406937600,2,841,4.793103448275862
6302010,5,B00IXD2N4C,"For me, five stars. Some have written that the plot is implausible. I did not find it so. I had never before heard of Juliane Kohler until coming across this movie on Netflix, but I now expect to see everything I can find with her. She is absolutely rivetting, with an astonishingly expressive face.  In fact, at nearly fifty years of age, she is more beautiful than she was in movies ten and twenty years earlier.

Too, Liv Ullman is wonderful as her mother. I haven't see Ms. Ullman since the many movies she made with Ingmar Bergman in the late 50's and 60's, as well as the wonderful ""The Emigrants"".

The rest of the cast is also quite good.  But Ms. Kohler, oh my, oh my.",1406592000,,677,4.307086614173229
6302011,3,B00IXD2N4C,"An implausible plot, but the film keeps your interest",1406073600,,53,5.0
6302012,4,B00IXD2N4C,"I am almost never disappointed when watching a 'foreign' film.knowing that Liv Ulman was in this is what first caught my eye and then the very compelling story - being a history buff - made this an easy choice and I liked the film very much.  I wish there were more like it.  I'd like to see the original Danish ""Wallander"" again; Netflix had it but I switched to Amazon months ago.  The original was/is,  so very goodnot that the BBC's ""Wallander"" isn't and Kenneth Branagh is a fine actor.  I just really could feel the original in my bones,  it was so very well done.  I will keep hoping that Amazon will keep..finding the excellent films coming from other countries.  Luther,  is also ""excellent""I have no idea how many other BBC/series 'we' aren't aware of are 'out there' !
Keep up the search Amazon for these superior films!",1405987200,,831,4.523489932885906
6302013,4,B00IXD2N4C,A nice surprise! A very good movie and we didn't even mind the subtitles.,1405555200,,73,4.285714285714286
6302014,4,B00IXD2N4C,"this film crawled along with a pace that probably could have used some punch. a well thought out and executed spy work with beautiful photography and highly believable characters. with a little more 'spy stuff' it might have come off better. it comes across with deep, norweigan stoicism, depression and fatality.",1404777600,7,313,5.1568627450980395
6302015,4,B00IXD2N4C,"This taut, spare, compelling thriller shows us that wars are never over for the individuals  or for the communities and nations engaged in  and affected by war.  Set against the historical threshold of the tearing down of the Berlin wall,  this film shows how WWII, Norways role in it, East Germany's continuing loyalty to many of the Nazi ideals  reaches with heart pounding force and reality into the eve of the 21st century.  The reveal at the end is positively shocking.  And for me, a  great history lesson.  A good gift for your local video library and a good addition to your own permanent collection.",1404604800,15,608,4.714285714285714
6302016,4,B00IXD2N4C,"After a series of total duds, I finally found this one which was extremely entertaining and well-done.  Plot kept my attention as well as good acting and writing.",1404518400,2,162,4.785714285714286
6302017,4,B00IXD2N4C,"This is a fascinating story about an event in history about which I knew little--the children born of Norwegian women and occupying German soldiers.  I did find it difficult to understand in the beginning but was glad I stuck with it.  For me it was of value more as a history lesson than a credible human drama.

 I loved the Norwegian scenery, particularly their beautiful homes.  All the actors were first rate.  It was wonderful to see Live Ullamn again.

6302018,4,B00IXD2N4C,"In giving this chilling film a four-star rather than the five-star rating it probably deserved, I confess that my American values may be at work. I would classify this as a political-horror film of the continental European variety, in which there are only villains and their victims and absolutely no heroes. I am not exactly certain why I found this film so disturbing that it actually gave me nightmares, but it might have something to do with the way in which it raises uncomfortable questions that it never answers about the role of the German Democratic Republic in the transition from the post-Nazi era to that of the mighty ""reunified"" Germany.

The Soviet ruse for stealing American identities for the purpose of planting spies in the US has been well-known for at least fifty years. It involved obtaining the names of people whose deaths were never a matter of record in the United States--in most cases those who had emigrated to the US from Eastern Europe and then gone back there to die. Zwei Leben suggests that ""Aryan"" women in Nazi-occupied Europe who had been impregnated by German soldiers, had their children wrested from them and spirited to Germany as part of the Lebensborn program. Forcibly held in orphanages in the post-war period and estranged from their non-German families, who knew nothing of their whereabouts, these children were either coerced into spying for the GDR when they came of age or, if they refused to cooperate, were murdered so that their identities could be exploited as cover for those who were willing to become part of the East German espionage apparatus.

The ending is more moralistic than realistic--and somehow not in keeping with the rest of this masterfully told but very cynical story, which unfolds before the viewer like a macabre reality TV show run amok.",1428364800,8,1813,4.921568627450981
6302019,5,B00IXD2N4C,"As opposed to some reviewers, I did not find the plot confusing. Great cinematography, acting, and story line. A very good and incredibly sad film.",1425859200,,147,4.92

6302021,4,B00IXD2N4C,Wow! True story. The whole Hitler catastrophe has spread so much unimaginable destruction into the world in ways that we we will never know. So many lives destroyed.,1416009600,,165,4.928571428571429

6302023,4,B00IXD2N4C,"Well written, acted, and developed throughout the entire movie. Very entertaining. I didn't think it was slow; I felt it was suspenseful and quite intriguing. Amazing what the past still has hidden of such poignant, true stories.",1413072000,,229,5.216216216216216

8645911,5,B00IXD2N4C,"Magnificent acting, but so sad.  The children abandoned by the Norwegian government, because so many were turned into spies by east Germany.  All the lives ruined.  Ken duken as the German lawyer is one of a,stellar cast.",1506211200,,221,4.918918918918919
8645912,5,B00IXD2N4C,"This is a great movie. Interesting, original, the right amount of action and character development, and very thought provoking.  There's some violence, but not too upsetting at all in terms of graphic details. A couple references to sex that could be a little embarrassing if your kids or parents are present, but in the end hardly worth mentioning. This movie is extremely good and not to be missed. You'll want to see it more than once.",1483401600,,438,4.7631578947368425

8645914,5,B00IXD2N4C,The story is true so is the acting. The acting by all four members of the family is so powerful and believable that you will be glued to the story even-though you have to read CC at the same time. A must see DVD. Bravo.,1457136000,2,219,3.888888888888889

8645917,5,B00IXD2N4C,"A gripping story that deals with historical events along six generations (1944- 2014) through the time, that will include Nazi officers, a besieged Norway, a missing daughter, an impatient mother.

In sum, a puzzle of facts that will develop through your eyes until the very end. You will be amazed due this sinister web of control over the individual liberty, the Big Eye announced by Orwell will make its implacable presence destroying dreams, hopes and illusions.

Brilliant, shocking and arresting from start to end. Liv Ullman fabulous as always in this smartly directed film.

Another brilliant German filmic gem. Not to be missed.",1438560000,,637,5.165048543689321
8645918,5,B00IXD2N4C,Excellent movie.  It takes a episode of history that few in the US t know about and weaves an amazing suspense movie. This reflects on post war Germany -- both East and West; Norway's unspoken history of the children of shame.  The Lebensborn children.  I won't say more and be a spoiler.  Just watch it -- you won't be disappointed. Warning it is dark.,1437177600,4,353,4.46875
