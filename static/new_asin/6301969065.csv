390885,4,6301969065,"The Human Comedy is the story of a poor family whose strong love for each other help them through all times of crisis. The father of the family has just died two years ago, and the oldest son (Van Johnson) is away at war. Now Homer (Mickey Rooney) is the man of the house and his job at a telegraph office sustains the family. He's still in high school, so we see the way he interacts with kids his own age as well. Also, we peek into the lives of his younger brother Ulysses (Jackie Jenkins) and sister Bess (Donna Reed).

This film is terribly sentimental and very biased toward family and Christianity. However, sometimes it is too sentimental and instead of seeming genuine, it comes off as a bit forced. The lessons are true, but they're presented in a way one would speak to a four year old. The story and performances are still good, but one would expect that from such a wonderful cast. It is certainly refreshing to watch these types of feel-good films to escape from the pessimistic attitudes in modern movies.",1165708800,,1020,4.483870967741935
390886,5,6301969065,"This is a unique drama, one of those unusual dramas where there are no villains, no evil people. Yet, it's not a sweet-and-sugary movie, either. It's simply a ""slice of life,"" as they say, or ""Americana."" In the case, about life in a small California town during the middle of World War II. It is very true to the book written by William Saroyan.

The story features genuinely nice people who trust one another, respect one another, have manners, read the Bible and say their prayers, do what they are told and apologize if they are nasty....not exactly what you've seen in films in the past half century.

Although the film is a bunch of vignettes featuring a number of characters, Mickey Rooney is the central figure and I wonder if he ever was better. He is outstanding in here. I never realized what a good actor he was until I saw this movie.

Frank Morgan also was memorable in here, and I usually didn't care for the roles he played many times. But here, he's very serious and honest and real.

The ""slices of life"" include Rooney and his family, school friends, his job as a telegram delivery boy; Morgan and his drinking problem; James Craig and his romance; Van Johnson and his army buddies and Jackie ""Butch"" Jenkins and his little friends. Also of note are three young military men making an appearance, actors who became well known by the end of the decade: Robert Mitchum, Barry Nelson and Don DeFore. Donna Reed, Fay Bainter and Marsha Hunt add the female touch and a big dose of wholesome beauty. This has a deep cast, as you can see. There are other recognizable actors in here, too, such as ""Alfalfa"" (Carl Switzer) of ""Our Gang"" fame.

This picture of ""Americana"" is so innocent compared to today, it is almost shocking. A kiss was a big deal; nobody locked their doors at night; the girls went out on blind dates with the soldiers and all treated each other with respect.

It's a very sentimental film, which is another reason I like it. It's a sad comment about film critics who think that ""sentimental"" is a dirty word, but even those cynics still had praise for this film. It's so well done that it's hard not to praise it. If they just release this on DVD, perhaps more people would discover this gem.",1145750400,25,2225,4.522388059701493
390887,5,6301969065,"This film is both unique and profound.  There isn't a wasted scene in this film--in fact, it is crowded with poignant and profound images to go with the great words and acting. I found myself hanging on every word, enjoying every scene in this romantic vignette of the World War II homefront. Mickey Rooney delivers his finest performance, especially when he reads a letter from his brother (played by Van Johnson).  The co-stars would take up a whole page to describe, but it appears that MGM brought in every up and coming star to this cast. Share this one with a good friend. (for some reason, Ted Turner has yet to turn this into a DVD, so try to tape it off TCM when it plays).",1135814400,7,682,4.404761904761905
390888,5,6301969065,"The Human Comedy is one of the old standards, a patriotic, sentimental smorgasbord of home front Americana that every family should watch together.  On surface it's comparable to ""Sunday Dinner For A Soldier"" and ""The Fighting Sullivans,"" but overall a better picture.  It has a sad part, but is also uplifting, with many humorous and poignant scenes.

Mickey Rooney (Young Tom Edison, Boys Town, National Velvet, etc.) plays teenage Homer, who takes a job in the local telegraph office delivering messages - many of tragic news, since it's the height of World War II - to friends, acquaintances, and strangers throughout his home town, Ithaca.  His older brother Van Johnson (30 Seconds Over Tokyo, In The Good Old Summertime, etc.) has gone off to fight the war.  His  younger brother Ulysses - Useless to his friends (Jackie 'Butch' Jenkins, who also appeared in National Velvet and Our Vines Have Tender Grapes)  - is just five years old and discovering life with daily wonder.

Homer looks up to the manager of the telegraph office, James Craig (Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, Lost Angel), and the elderly telegrapher, Frank Morgan (The Wizard of Oz, The Shop Around The Corner), who requires, ""in the event of drunkenness - mine, not yours,"" a degree of understanding only a child can provide.  Homer clashes with a schoolmate, learns from his teacher, misses his brother, all in scenes with Leave-It-To-Beaver flavor.

Meanwhile Ulysses visits the town Library with his older friend Lionel (Darryl Hickman, who appeared in numerous movies including Keeper of the Flame and The Tingler, and whose brother Dwayne played Dobie Gillis).  Neither can read, but they sure are awed just to look at all the books, all of them different.  Later they join older boys stealing apricots, then Ulysses learns the meaning of fear from a mechanical man in a store window.

Homer's sister, Donna Reed (It's A Wonderful Life,  Ransom) entertains three soldiers on leave, played by Don DeFore (Ramrod, Ozzie and Harriet), Barry Nelson (A Guy Named Joe, Airport), and a very young Robert Mitchum.

Ray Collins, who went on to play Police Lieutenant Tragg on Perry Mason, plays the spirit of of Homer's late father, who narrates at the beginning and end of the film.

All of these actors play their roles well to make the movie effective, including the children.  Others in the cast include Marsha Hunt (Valley Of Decision, Lost Angel) as James Craig's girl, Fay Bainter (Our Town, State Fair) as Homer's mother, Clem Bevins (Wake Up And Dream) as the apricot owner, and in bit parts Morris Ankrum (who often played a judge on Perry Mason), Frank Craven (Our Town, Jack London, Penrod And Sam, etc.), S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall (In The Good Old Summertime, Casablanca), Carl Switzer (Alfalfa of the Little Rascals), and many others.",1125792000,14,2813,4.963752665245202
390889,4,6301969065,"A fine film.  It's pure, distilled, Grade-A, all-star, all-American, accept-no-substitutions, concentrated, three-hankie, melodramatic, sentimental, heartwarming, white picket fence, patriotic wartime schmaltz.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.  Mickey Rooney stars as Homer Macauley, a bright-eyed, fresh-faced, optimistic teenager living in Smalltown, USA during the height of World War Two, when all able bodied young men, including his older brother, have gone off to fight against the fascists and save civilization itself.  Still, even with soldiers passing through town and cannons crowding the trains that are headed back East towards Europe, the war is still far, far away, and civilization can still be saved right here, back on the homefront.  Taking his brother's place as ""the man of the family,"" Homer learns about hard work, fair play, compassion for others, and about disappointment and heartbreak as well.  It's all unremittingly corny, but that's entirely the point.  This is not a modern movie -- it isn't cynical or packed with obligatory violence, nor is it politically nuanced or notably subtle.  But it is a fine document of its time, sort of an ultimate exposition of the best and most cheerful face that mainstream, white America could put on the underlying grimness that a total war mobilization meant for America and the world.  It's a piece of homefront propaganda, but no less true to life, in its way, than any other film of the time.
The screenplay by William Saroyan is set in the author's home in California's fertile San Joaquin Valley, and while he makes sweeping nods towards the Valley's legendary cultural diversity (omitting, for the most part, blacks, Jews and Germans...), Saroyan gives Norman Rockwell a run for his money in the sentimental Americana category.  A couple of the religiously-themed scenes may be suffocating to secular or nonsectarian audiences, but other than the film's persistent preachiness, it's a fascinating slice of wartime historical hokum -- worth checking out its time capsule qualities, as well as for entertainment value.  Plus, it's packed with loads of great character actors and all-star cameos, including Frank Morgan (aka The Wizard Of Oz), as Homer's older mentor, Don Defore and (a very young) Robert Mitchum as babyfaced soldiers on leave, and Carl Switzler (""Alfalfa,"" of the Little Rascals) as a teenage hooligan.  This movie is sappy, sure... but it's also worth checking out if you have any interest in understanding American society at this critical juncture in our national history.",1077580800,46,2572,5.323456790123457
390890,5,6301969065,"This has always been one of my favorite films, since I saw it on TV about 30 years ago. Sentimental & Corny? Sure, but those who take the time to feel the deeper message will be rewarded. Apparently, some of my reviewing predecessors kept their minds closed to the depth (yes, that's right) of the story. First of all, this is a fable; a commentary not on life itself, but about life as it ought to be. The fact that it involves Ithaca, and characters named Homer, Ulysses & Marcus suggests Greek tragedy (the irony of the title) and the Greek chorus (the father). I couldn't possibly deny the fact that there are plenty of sappy moments, but they are layered & blended with some quite profound lessons. Let's not forget that in 1942 the war was at its absolute peak and enouragement like this was not only welcome but very necessary. Mickey Rooney gave a relaxed, centered performance, probably his best; Frank Morgan, Fay Bainter, James Craig, Marsha Hunt...all wonderful. How can you not feel for Homer when he has to deliver a singing telegram to his girlfriend...sent by his rival? Clarence Brown, known for heart-tuggers (The Yearling, National Velvet) came thru with flying colors, juggling the very complicated events & episodes into a coherent narrative. Say or think what you want...I was moved and touched by the over-all power of this film. It is quite verbose, and some of the preachy little speeches might've been shortened, but the substance of those little speeches hit home powerfully. Home, family, work, love...all those things that matter...are portrayed here as they ""ought"" to be, and after the tragedy of Sept 11, I welcome this little reminder of the things we have that are taken so much for granted. UPDATE: I have the DVD, and I'm quite happy to watch it again. A wonderful film experience.",1008374400,78,1817,4.789808917197452
390891,2,6301969065,"Though William Saroyan's original work had many a deficiency, and indeed had much excessive flag waving, the characterisation, lighter scenes, and inclusion of a few other ""supporting players"" made it a bit more believable. This film is tedious, totally ""preachy,"" and one in which few characters seem at all like anyone who actually walks the earth.
The Saroyan novel, for all its excessive patriotic references, basically dealt with a young man's growing to maturity. Mickey Rooney's efforts to make Homer Macauley a likeable teenager are noble, but the film version reduces him to one dimension. Young Ulysses, who has a certain charm in the book, seems a cartoon character. Mother Macaulay is the worst of all - delivering weighty pseudo-wisdom in awesome tones that would put one in mind of the wax figures who sat in ""Grandma Predicts"" booths at Coney Island.
The ending (which I'll not reveal, though it is obvious from the first scene) is sad but realistic in the book - grotesque in the film. The very last line Homer utters, and which is not in the original, is an attempt at inappropriate cheer that comes out as macabre.
Much more could have been done with a cast such as this, but the adaptation is one of the worst.",976838400,6,1229,4.80188679245283
390892,5,6301969065,"In today's society where everything seems to be based on cyniscim, this movie is absolutey refreshing.  It takes you back to small town life that has all but vanished from the face of America today.  Some viewers may find  it trite and corny, but I saw the sweetness in it.  When Mickey Rooney  reads the letter from his brother Van Johnson it never fails to bring tears  to my eyes. I found this movie touching, and a far cry from the craziness  in the movies we see these days.  I like remembering what life was like  back then.  A time when neighbors were neighors, and everyone in town knew  each other.  If you don't watch this movie, you are missing a gem.  I  recently wrote Miss Helen Hunt who also starred in the movie with James  Craig and thanked her for making this movie, she graciously wrote me back  and gave me her autograph even though she must be in her eighties,but shes  a product of the old hollywood, when stars were really stars. Watch this  movie you won't regret it.",924134400,61,991,4.3812154696132595
390893,1,6301969065,"This film starts off in a troubling way.  You look down from the clouds at the town of Ithaca, CA. You get a voice-over narration from a character you  soon learn is the dead father of the family you're about to meet.  This is  just the beginning of a relentless artillery barrage of syrupy  sentimentality. The story focuses on the character of Homer, played by  Mickey Rooney.  His older brother Marcus, played by Van Johnson, is a  soldier fighting in WWII.  Another important character is his younger  brother Ulysses, played by Butch Jenkins.  Aside from male characters all  named after Greek or Roman figures, there is a cast of underdeveloped  female characters whose primary purpose seems to be acting saintly.  Indeed, the whole family is too saintly.  The film is a series of contrived  scenes all designed to tug your hearstrings, most of which leave you  embarrassed.  Perhaps the most ridiculous element of the plot concerns the  character of Tobey, soldier-friend of older brother Marcus.  Tobey is an  orphan who hangs on Marcus's stories of family life as avidly as a hungry  dog might chew a soup bone. The movie culminates with a strange and, in my  view, twisted homecoming which is even more unbelievable than the rest of  the plot.  The best one can say about this film is that at least MGM spared  us from author William Saroyan's original vision, which would have  delivered four hours of this mawkish nonsense.  The novel Saroyan wrote,  based on this screenplay, is, alas, as disturbingly awful as the film  itself.",923097600,6,1541,4.837837837837838

390955,5,6301969065,"Many may find the story here overly sentimental at times but nearly every sequence is underlined with humanity. It effectively captures the time in which it was produced and I would submit that this is Mickey Rooney's finest performance. Frank Morgan is also quite moving in his portrayal of a sad, aging alcoholic. It all takes place during World War II when young men from across the country were heading to war, some returning injured, some not returning at all. Families endure the struggles of worry, privation, normal (yet not-so-normal) lives and cope with hopes and fears, large and small. Most of the script centers around Homer's (Rooney's) family but various people within its orbit are effectively brought to life in multi-layered fashion. Dated only by the time period evoked. The emotions, rather, are eternal. Direction and cinematography are great compliments as the tale unfolds. A wholly satisfying movie experience!

Thus, this sets me up to really like this movie, but it's beyond that. The town, the simple story, just truly pulls you into the town. Rooney is great, but it's the town and the spirit of the movies that drive it. If you are watching this type of movie, I'm going to guess that that same spirit is something you'll love. Donna Reed is a nice touch added in, and we see the first appearance of Robert Mitchum as well. If you have any interest in this type of movie, then it's probably a must see.

I was born the year after all hostilities ceased but saw this film early on and when life was still pretty much as depicted here.  Small city and town America meant most everyone knowing everyone else and most everyone caring for everyone else.  A time when your neighbor became a trusted friend and doing something for someone else was not a thing that made your wallet fatter. It was a time of unlocked houses & cars but most of all...unlocked hearts.  As told and seen through the eyes of the now deceased Matthew Macauley, played by Ray Collins, the patriarch of this family, the story is one of unity, love, friendship, hope undaunted and American ideals. Homer Macauley, portrayed by Mickey Rooney, takes a job at the local telegraph office delivering telegrams after school while his brother Marcus, portrayed by Van Johnson, is away at war and serving their country. Homer means to help his family during this time so his mother, portrayed by Fay Bainter, doesn't have such a difficult time keeping life and limb intact. Throughout his days at school and work he meets and learns wonderful lessons from some interesting & valuable people about living and becoming a man!  Michael Craig, Frank Morgan, Donna Reed and Marsh Hunt round out the cast and that little freckle faced kid, Jackie ""Butch"" Jenkins, gives a very memorable performance as Ulysses Macauley.

391030,4,6301969065,"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties.
While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring.
Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson. There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father.
While this film is not exactly what I'd call electrifying, it celebrates life and the human ability to persevere regardless of the circumstances. The remastered copy is easier on the eyes.",1344297600,3,1863,4.993569131832797

391052,5,6301969065,"Born in 1945, I was given the name of my father's cousin, an infantryman who died in Germany in 1944.  I have seen the telegram that came to my aunt from the War Department with the news of his death.  In this 1943 film, Mickey Rooney plays a telegram delivery boy who must often deliver the news of a lost or wounded son to families in his small California town.  For me, the film is excruciatingly poignant.

Viewed more than 60 years later, there are flaws in this film -- overlong patriotic monologues, unlikely hymn singing, and a simply impossible ending.  These flaws, however, are more than redeemed by the wonderful interaction between the young telegram delivery boy ""Homer"" (Mickey Rooney) with elderly telegrapher ""Mr. Grogan"" (Frank Morgan), and by the tragic surprise in Mr. Grogan's last telegram.

Looking back on old films, we are now alert for how they portrayed race.  There are contrary notes in ""The Human Comedy.""  A picnic scene intended to show America's immigrant diversity includes only white ethnics; it jars.  Yet Asian-Americans in uniform are clearly shown on a troop train, and the omission of African Americans is balanced with an opening scene of a passing train.  The white engineer ignores a boy's eager waves, while an African-American hitching a ride on the caboose is cheerful and open.  Embarrassed by the lack of inclusion, did director Clarence Brown add the scene as a chapeau?

Long and wordy scenes in the film, with some special effects, come across today as too sentimental, yet they deserve our attention.  The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther called them ""maudlin gobs of cinematic goo.""  During the war, however, there were 400,000 telegrams delivered to American families announcing the death of a service member -- a now unthinkable scale of tragedy that touched the whole of America.  In this film, author William Saroyan, screenplay writer Howard Estabrook, and director Clarence Brown gave Americans ways to think about and speak of death and sacrifice.  All agree this was America's ""good war.""  Who can now criticize this film's attempt to help grieving Americans cope?

The reading of a letter to Homer from his older brother in uniform now seems overlong, too perfect.  Yet, wasn't that a letter we all would write if we could, or keep forever if we received it?  Those times still reside in our hearts.

391053,5,6301969065,"I hadn't seen this film in many years. Willam Saroyan wrote this Oscar Wining Film (Best Screenplay - Himself) so long ago, during the height of W.W.II and set it in a small California Town. The times, have changed dramatically since then, but it's incredibly soothing and reasuring to know that basically, down deep, people have not. Not in the ways that matter most. This film should make a home in your movie-hearts forever with the truly memorable characters, situations and performances by it's expert cast, headed by the very young Mickey Rooney. Mickey Rooney you say? This Rooney performance got him a Best Actor Oscar Nomination in 1943 alongside Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper amongst others - not bad company to be in. The black & white cinematography by Harry Stradling is superb, as is the transfer of the entire movie. Though the film lost out on the Best Picture Oscar (to 'Casablanca'), it's remained my very favorite film of that year! They literally don't make films like this anymore.

391054,2,6301969065,"I read the book long ago (twice, I think), and liked it very much. I just saw the film
today, and except for some good acting by Mickey Rooney and Frank Morgan, and the charming scene in the library,
I didn't care for the film at all.
(I'm going to read the book again, soon.) Wikipedia points out that the book differs from the film.

Here's what Wikpedia says:

Saroyan wrote a movie treatment and a screenplay that he was asked to direct. He was paid off and removed from the project when his film proved to be more than two hours long. Saroyan was not at all happy with the film as completed by Brown, and he wrote his novel from the script he produced. The novel was published at the same time as the film's release with the intent of countering the film version of the story. There are noticeable differences between the film and the novel, including a stronger characterization of Ulysses, the small boy, in the novel and far fewer scenes of sentiment than were incorporated into the film by Estabrook and Brown (social criticism is also much blunter in the novel).[2] Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, who suggested that this was his favorite film, also suggest a very definite ""MGM house style"".

I do remember one small difference between the book and the film: in the film, the librarian says to the
children that she has been reading books for many years, and she emphasizes that it has enriched her life. In the
book, the librarian says that she has been reading books for many years, and she can't say that it has made
much of a difference in her life. (I remember laughing at that - Saroyan's biting humor, I guess.) The book also has the charming scene in the library, with the two small boys. Saroyan has always been one of my favorite writers, I'd say. (except for his book ""The Adventures of Wesley Jackson,"" which was terrible, I thought.)(P.S.: I became a librarian, myself!)",1320451200,2,1891,4.50728862973761
391055,4,6301969065,"You can put this movie up alongside ""The Fighting Sullivans"" and ""Since You Went Away"". In other words: superb.

Very much of its time, very sentimental, some heartbreaking scenes, good acting throughout. You feel sad after watching it but...you don't feel rotten (modern movie makers take note).

The fact that America could keep churning out these wonderful movies is a testament to the Hollywood studio system. We'll never see their like again.

This is one of the young Mickey Rooney's best roles, but it's full of warm, familiar faces. Maybe some of the propaganda now seems a bit embarrassing but, as said, it's of its time and at least you knew who the enemy was.

There's a terrific scene when the youngsters go ""scrumping"" (taking fruit from an old feller's yard)which is virtually the same one as in the ""Sullivans"". Wonderful.

391057,5,6301969065,"AT LAST IT's BEEN PRESERVED on DVD--and it's ABOUT TIME!! You can hurl all the insults you want, but they won't begin to affect the magical, dreamlike (but somewhat off-beat) effect of this unique film, created by Saroyan as a screenplay first, then adapted as a book afterwards---Louis B. Mayer's favorite among the films produced under his rule.

Certainly, a jaded, elitist snob will reject the overt sentiment of ""The Human Comedy"" but, then again, the deep and mysterious dimension, the warm, tender mysticism that springs from this gentle, homespun tale of a community united during the darkest days of WWII will obviously have eluded them.

A PAGEANT OF SMALL-TOWN AMERICANA, a series of insightful little vignettes about human nature as seen through the eyes of a 15-year old boy who must assume the role of head-of-the-family during the War. I mean, c'mon...the film opens with the voice and spirit of a dead man hovering in the clouds over the verdant fields of his former home town; this is NO ORDINARY TALE of war-time tragedy, but Saroyan's own uniquely emotional view, he being an Armenian immigrant who saw nothing but the greatness and goodness of his adopted homeland, the good old U.S.A.; got a problem with that? --then go spend your time (and vitriol) elsewhere!

MICKEY ROONEY---great actor? Watch this film and decide for yourself. Check the scene where the Mick reads aloud a letter from his brother Marcus--you will witness an utterly masterful example of emotional power and restraint. His reading could serve as a textbook for anyone who presumes to understand the actor's craft.

FRANK MORGAN--""the great Oz himself!""---great actor? - again, watch and decide.

Young Mickey Rooney, who quickly learns life's lessons as a war-time telegram delivery boy, discovers a surrogate father in his boss, played by a strapping young James Craig...a kindly, highly principled young guy who is in love with an absolutely ravishing young Marsha Hunt. But we really don't understand their relationship until an intriguing, lovely scene in a moonlit garden outside of her family's ritzy home, accompanied by Herbert Stothart's breezy, tender background score.

I'll admit that Marcus (Van Johnson) picks up that dang' accordion and leads his army buddies in song at least ONE-TOO-MANY times during the film, but it is his friendship with his pal Toby, a fellow soldier who was orphaned (and thus exists without an identity in Saroyan's cosmic view), that provides the film with its most curious and uplifting conclusion (which one reviewer here even describes as ""macabre!""). Saroyan sought to offer his mystical, magical concept of the ETERNAL FLOW and RENEWAL OF LIFE as solace for a grief-stricken America, which was desperately in search of comfort in 1943.  Yeah, it may seem a little clumsy and naive at times, but so what? There are simply too many fascinating and excellent things to comment on in this magnificent film, itself a two-hour TAPESTRY of small-town American life, produced during the heyday of the legendary MGM studio.

AND SPEAKING OF 9/11: There is a scene fairly late in the film, where James Craig and his lovely bride (Ms Hunt) are out for a drive in his convertible. They slowly cruise through a sunny park, where an International ethnic festival is in full swing, with dancers of many nations performing. Mr. Craig comments on each dance, while Herbert Stothart's music brilliantly combines the various ethnic rhythms and tunes with a gorgeous, underlying ""My Country 'tis of Thee"", thus underscoring the fact that these ""diverse"" immigrant groups, despite their cultural differences which they celebrate, are all essentially---profoundly---AMERICAN.  The young couple parks the car overlooking a beautiful California vista---vineyards, fields, mountains, while behind the car we see a shimmery, sun-lit pond and a delicate bridge, across which children seem to dance; it is a vision of pastoral, radiant beauty, which mirrors the emotional ecstasy of the newlywed couple. And, after having shared their dreams of their future first child, Mr. Craig tells his bride that he has decided to enlist in the Navy (and this shortly before he must help young Mickey deal with the devastating emotional blow that we...and his  chracter....felt was coming all along).

And such is the fascinating, one-of-a-kind magic and deceptively simple puzzle of ""The Human Comedy""; you simply CANNOT judge it as if it were a standard war-era film.

Oh, yes...when my wife and I first watched the folk-dance scene described above, she commented that it was ""awfully hoaky.""  The next time we watched it together was three days after 9-11, and the SAME SCENE left us both weeping like little kids.

AT LAST, Turner/MGM/Warner Home Video---WHOEVER is responsible---THANKS for finally releasing this great film on DVD.  And Mickey Rooney and Marsh Hunt are STILL WITH US, and will hopefully be able to enjoy what very well may be their greatest film achievement!!

391059,4,6301969065,"The movie ""The Human Comedy"", (1943) is a dark, melancholy slice of life taken from the home front, during World War II.  The movie centers on the Macauley family, and begins with the voice of Mr. Macauley speaking from the great beyond.  ""I have been dead for two years"" he says, while we, the viewing audience are watching the youngest Macauley, Ulysses, looking at a gopher pushing up dirt around his hole.  ""My beliefs still live in the faces of my family"" the disembodied voice from beyond tells us as we are introduced to the other family members.
The second son, Homer, (Mickey Rooney) is a telegraph messenger and is the link between families as he makes his rounds and is deeply affected by each encounter.  His telegrams usually mean that some poor soldier has died, and it is Homers job to give the family the bad news.
At Homer's office, Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan) is a philosophizing, gentle old drunk, who tells Homer, to help him in case of excessive drunkenness.  ""Water in the face if a shrug does not work, followed up by black coffee.  If you see me in the street in the fit of drunkenness don't make fun of me, as I am a sensitive old man, and not taken with public ridicule"".
The third son, Marcus, (Van Johnson) is a private in the army and has a child hood sweetheart who lives next door.  Marcus and his buddy, the orphaned Toby, are preparing to go to war.
Mrs. Macauley is seen as a kind of everyone's mother, speaking in kindly soft tones, and the camera filter softly blurring her image as if to make her appear more saintly.  She seems to tell the audience that everything will be ok, a reassurance greatly needed in 1943.  With the war raging on, and the dead soldiers mounting, it is not hard to imagine the movie-going public hanging on her every word.  When young Ulysses asks his mother where his father has gone, she responds in a soft voice, and tries to explain to the young boy, and the audience, her very motherly views on death.  ""The end is the beginning"" she whispers.  The dead husband then appears in a ghost-like fashion, and kisses her lovingly on the head.  There couldn't have been a dry eye in the theater after that scene!
Homer, the messenger, takes a telegram of a soldier's death to the soldier's mother, Mrs. Sandoval.  Mrs. Sandoval cannot read English, and asks Homer to please read the telegram to her.  Homer, clearly shaken, says, ""It says your son is dead Mrs. Sandoval.""  Homer is going through some changes now, as the country was then, and says to his mother, ""School seems so silly now.""  Homer's character is reflecting the mood of the country as it tried to deal with all the deaths coming out of the Pacific and European theaters.  Also by choosing a Hispanic mother, the audience is being reminded that we are all in this together, and that we are all Americans.
There is also an interesting side story going on at the same time.  Mr. Spangler, Homers boss, is dating a society girl that he really likes.  The problem is that he is of working class and he does not want to mix with the wealthy.  He refuses to wear a tie and says that they will just have to take him as he is.  He meets the girl's family and friends but does everything in his power to keep a distance.  It was not until the girl tells him that her grandfather was once a day laborer, that he realizes that there is not as much difference between them as he thought.  This is to further illustrate to the audience that we are all equal in some way, and that we are all fighting for the same cause.
Donna Reed is Homer's sister Bess Macauley.  One of my favorite scenes is where Bess and Mary meet up with some soldiers and go to a movie together.  They all go as friends, with Bess and in another message to the audience, we see Mary feeling that they are helping out the war effort by being nice to the GI's.  One of the GI's says very poignantly ""I guess you don't get to understand your country until it is in trouble.""
Van Johnson is killed and Mr. Grogan receives the telegraph.  He dies of an apparent heart attack before he finished typing the message, and Homer finds him slumped in his chair.  Homer is stunned by the message and the death of his friend.  Mr. Spangler arrives to help deal with Mr. Grogan and to console Homer.  As Homer and Mr. Spangler are playing horse shoes in the park Toby the orphan arrives from the war.  Toby has adopted the town of Ithaca as his own, and has memorized all the names of Homer's family, as well as the streets and buildings of Ithaca.  Toby finds the Macauley home and is standing in front of it dreamily as Homer arrives home.  Homer recognizes the soldier as his brother's best friend Toby, and invites him in.  This can be seen as a message to Americans to welcome all the soldiers home.
The sappiness and war time propaganda in this film is never ending.  It is also one of my all time favorites!",1235520000,4,4885,4.400890868596882
391060,5,6301969065,"This is a film for people willing to surrender to the story.  Writer William Saroyan meant his story to be a common-man epic, which means that the language is sometimes heroic or epigrammatic - as epic language is supposed to be - and the storyline contains the possibility of the supernatural and the divine; and yet the characters are all ordinary people in smalltown America.

In short, this is what Americans wanted to think of themselves, at their best, during World War II.  If you expect realism, you will be disappointed; if you can't give yourself emotionally to a film, you will find it sappy.

The subtle reactions of the telegraph news in the book gets replaced with patriotic banter or perhaps even propaganda. The acting is corny and Andy Rooney who plays the messenger Homer spends far more time in the book with subtle interaction than speeches to the film audience.
The film is an interesting time capsule into a simpler time when line between good and evil could be believed and we believed in our own illusions. Patriotic posters peek out from the background and Donna Reed's porcelain beauty haunts the screen.
