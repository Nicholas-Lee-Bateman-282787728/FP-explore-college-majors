Now, it is 20 minutes and then the rest of my day can take place. This video helped me realize what a difference simple stretches and breathing can make in my life. I am more alert to my surroundings and notice the  simple things in life that I had taken for granted for so long. I no longer feel my carpal tunnel pain, and have a better perspective on what is truly improtant in life. My chronic neck and shoulder pain have all but disappeared.",1197417600,6,587,4.017094017094017
2569819,5,B000FJTVB0,"I met Aaron Hoopes at the Manchester, NH health expo, 2007. He was giving a talk on Zen Yoga and a demonstration of his ""Daily Warm-Up"". I decided to purchase the DVD and started using it daily. What a smart thing for me to do! My body responded positively with in the first week. Now 2 months later I am no longer in pain and have lost 6 pounds. A 7 month injury that was not healing well, even though I was treated in physical therapy, was now responding. Thank You, Aaron Hoopes for putting together such a creative simple program for anyone, old or young, to heal themselves. Remember to keep breathing! Joanne B.",1197244800,6,617,4.373913043478261
2569820,5,B000FJTVB0,"I really enjoy doing this 20 min. series of simple movements.  More qigong than yoga, this DVD is similar in style to two other chi routines I've seen - David-Dorian Ross's ""AM Chi for Beginners"" and Shoshanna Katzman's ""Qigong for Staying Young"".  Very little floor space is needed as the series of movements are done standing.  Unlike tai chi which requires more travelling space, you basically stay in the same spot which works well in my small apartment.  The setting is indoors and the instructor practises in front of a brick wall with a large plant over to one side.  If I could have changed anything about this routine I'd have had it filmed outdoors in a park, but it's so calming and restful I overlook that fact.

The focus is on breathing alongside fluid body movements.  You begin by gathering chi (energy) and move on to rotating various parts of your body one area at a time, to free up energy and release tension.  It's very peaceful and meditative, yet also energizing.  The instructor is soft spoken and gives great breathing cues, although there is also the option of playing it with just music or no sound at all for when you're familiar with the breath techniques.  There are a few yoga-like balance postures included near the end, as well as a side stretch which resembles yoga, but as I said it's mostly qigong with continuous movement, and feels healing and rejuvenating, while being extremely gentle and accessible to people of all fitness levels.  I like to do this as a warm up prior to yoga or a cardio workout, but also do it on days when I am short on time just by itself, to start my day in a peaceful state of mind.  It'll be interesting to see what else the instructor puts out later, as I believe this is the first in an as yet unreleased series.",1152921600,13,1780,4.510903426791277

8123879,5,B000FJTVB0,This is a great little daily warm-up and only takes twenty minutes to complete. I felt I had really stretched every part of my body after the Dvd had finished,1402617600,,158,4.3
8123880,5,B000FJTVB0,"The focus of breathing and simple movement in this 20 minutes with Aaron Hoopes relaxes me.  I make time for it every afternoon and look forward to it. By incorporating this video into a daily practice, I have also begun to feel some sustainable benefit for recurring shoulder pain.  I am very pleased with this purchase.",1379462400,,321,4.714285714285714
8123881,5,B000FJTVB0,"This yoga warm-up is easy to do and not intimidating. It only takes 20 minutes and since it is done standing up, is perfect for people who can't or don't like to get on the floor. The warm-up includes stretches, breathing exercises and balancing exercises. Initially I found some of the breath work to go on a bit long, but I have come to appreciate the meditative quality of this part of the warm-up. Once I became familiar with the routine, I was thankful for the option of shutting off the narration and only having the music as it allows me to be more focused. It is the only yoga DVD I can get my husband to do. My first copy I bought at my doctor's office who had it on display in his lobby. I have given it to two friends who both love it as well.",1374019200,,754,4.101351351351352
8123882,5,B000FJTVB0,"Since I purchased the Zen Yoga Daily Warm-Up DVD my life changed to the better. To start the day with the exercises shown and guided by Aaron Hoopes, author of several books, makes the day and its work load much easier to take. It seems less bumpy. I strongly recommend this DVD as a welcoming start into the day.",1289520000,,313,4.322033898305085
8123883,4,B000FJTVB0,This DVD surprised me and I thoroughly enjoy it. It is relaxing and just the right length to start your energy flowing. It's great before you start work or to relax and centre yourself before bedtime.,1235606400,3,200,4.583333333333333

A lovely combination of QiGong and Yoga movements. At 20 minutes for the main program, it is perfect as a morning routine. Great for grounding and energizing. It has also managed to get me breathing better during the day - quite habit-forming I guess!",1234569600,3,412,7.098039215686274
8123885,5,B000FJTVB0,"This is a great warm-up or a mini work out!

Breathwork is a focus throughout, while upper and lower body are being worked at the same time, bringing balance to mind, body, and spirit.

Whenever I am not feelng motivated I can pop in Zen Yoga Daily Warm-Up DVD, move along with Aaron's instruction, and I am ready to go!",1233100800,4,320,4.316666666666666
8123886,5,B000FJTVB0,"I did this DVD for the first time last week.  Later that day, I had to climb a two story ladder, which is quite difficult for me since I am afraid of heights.

I thought that the exercises certainly improved my sense of balance.  I found myself breathing deeply as I ascended each rung.  Thanks Aaron - for helping to get me to the top!",1212969600,3,336,4.123076923076923
