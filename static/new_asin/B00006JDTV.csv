7970105,1,B00006JDTV,"We received our copy as a gift.  I suffered through four or five viewings before shoving it in a ""donate"" pile.

The producers seem to think that using imaginary creatures entitles them to use imaginary forms of English!  The songs, by the way they were worded, made little sense.",1235779200,,280,4.673469387755102
7970106,2,B00006JDTV,I purchased this and another Kingdom of Goode title based on the positive reviews from Amazon users.  I was extremely disappointed when I received this DVD.  The animation is just plain terrible.  The story moves along much too slowly to keep a young child's interest.  The only positive I found in this video was the quality of the songs.  My two-year-old girls very rarely ask to watch this DVD.,1061510400,,397,4.695652173913044
