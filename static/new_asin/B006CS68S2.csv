8496574,1,B006CS68S2,"The product description claims this is a DVD Audio disc; which if true would play in a car with a surround sound system such as a Mercedes or Acura.  In reality this is just a regular DVD Video.

I've not bothered to watch it, so I've no idea if it is any good.  Once I realized that it was misrepresented in the product description, I had Amazon issue a refund, which they were quick to do.  Too bad the seller has not yet corrected the product description.",1415232000,,458,4.2298850574712645
