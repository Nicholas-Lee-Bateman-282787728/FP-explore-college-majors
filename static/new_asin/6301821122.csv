372155,4,6301821122,"First of all, in a age when carmens time period is being shifted around, and all sorts of ""new"" interpretations are poaring forth, its nice to see an old style Carmen.

  As to the Performance, Samuel Ramey is the ideal Escamillio.  His dashing looks and generous Bass Baritone, mean real thrills.  He does not have a single moment of strain, and turns in the ideal Escamillio.

  Leona Mitchell is a superb Micaela.  She look beautiful in her blue dress, and sings with her usual present tone, and glorious top notes.

There are serious reservations about Carreras's Don Jose.  Von Karajan, who conducted Carmen from more than 60 years, Called the Jose of Jose Carreras, the best.  Carreras picked up the role in1982, and found it the perfect vehicle for his declining voice.  He could call forth his famous emotional intensity, and cover up his vocal problems with his vocal energy.  The role of Jose requires pathos, but not too much legato or vocal nuance.  I have the honor of having seen the Jose of Carreras at the Orange festival, on video, in 1984.  Then, His Jose was a force of nature.  Unfortunatly this Met production captures Jose only 2 months prior to his entrance of a leukemia ward.  Jose is strained vocally, there can be no doubt, and this strain occasionally marrs his commitment to the drama.  He is at the end of his rope vocally and in shows.

  Agnes Baltsa is a wonderful Mezzo for the role of Carmen.  Rather than caniving and two faced, he Carmen is as genuinly credulous and fickle as her actions suggest.  Rather than being manipulative, she is actually deeply in love with Jose.  Her voice is wonderful, with one drawback.  She has a clear register change, between Chesty contralto, and heady soprano, both voices are wonderful, but the switch can be clunky at times,

  Enjoy this carmen!! Its well worth it!",1102982400,9,1840,4.69811320754717
372156,4,6301821122,"Anticipating my participation in an upcoming production of this Bizet classic, I got the DVD of the Met's production of CARMEN.  I'm very pleased to own it, and hope that those who read this review do purchase it.
James Levine's conducting of this work is magnificent.  You can just see the passion that he brings forth for this opera.  He is paired with a very talented group of singers in the principal roles.  Singing the mysterious Carmen is mezzo Agnes Baltsa.  Now, at first glance, Baltsa's age really got to me.  She looks considerably older than her part should be.  However, there's something about her performance that just seduces.  It's a combination of the nuances in her stage movement, as well as the versatile singing range she has to offer--especially in her 1st act Seguidilla.  Jos Carerras (of ""3 Tenors"" fame) brings a certain gusto to his Don Jos, which works for the most part, but can get overdone in a few spots.  Bass-Baritone Sam Ramey offers an appropriately pompous Torero in his singing of Escamillo.
The biggest standout in this cast, however, is in soprano Leona Mitchell's portrayal of shy country girl Micala.  Her 3rd act aria ""Je dis que rien ne m'pouvante"" is SOMETHING ELSE!!  The supporting roles of Dancare and Remendado got an enjoyably slimy characterization, and Carmen's gypsy friends Frasquita and Mercdes are intriguing in the 3rd act ""Card Trio.""
My first qualm with the DVD is the lack of extra features.  Granted, this opera was filmed in 1988, but a documentary or even some production notes other than in the liner notes couldn't have hurt.  My next qualm was with 2 distracting video qualities.  First off, there are some times where some lighter pixels in dark areas were very evident and distracting.  Also on some televisions, the video quality is automatically brightened whenever a subtitle appears...
These are small things, and really aren't much of a bother when you consider the gem of the DVD:  wonderful performances onstage and in the orchestra.",1009670400,,2010,4.916913946587537
372157,3,6301821122,"I ordered this DVD and I am so disappointed in it that I have not been inclined to watch any of my collection of about 15 operas on DVD. I was attracted to this because Carreras was the tenor, and I have so many operas featuring Placido Domingo.  The version, with Carreras, is very amateurish.  I can't believe this was presented at the Metropolitan, which I think is the information given.  I am now in the process of ordering the Domingo version, and hope it will be more to my satisfacition. It took me a long time to add Carmen to my collection.  Because of its popularity,I have seen it so many times. Now, I am once more interested in watching it again - a version I can appreciate.",1009065600,6,689,4.317829457364341
372158,4,6301821122,"I love to see people obviously relishing what they do, so it was a delight to watch Levine conducting and Baltsa singing this wonderful music.  This supreme opera, however, also brings regret that Bizet's life was so brief and his marvelous works were so few.  Bizet perhaps envisioned a 20-something Carmen, but I bet that Baltsa, 45-ish at the time of this performance, would have seduced him just as she did me and Carreras's hapless Don Jose'.  Of course, Baltsa and Levine have the best parts, but that also means they carry major responsibility.  A video production needs more than just their great singing and musicianship, and those extras are not lacking.  The costumes do a lot for Baltsa, and Baltsa does a lot for the costumes.  It's not just the provocative display of cleavage, either (and Baltsa knows how to use every jiggle to get her way), but the sheer force of a powerful female personality that integrates with voice and sex to dominate the stage, as Carmen must.  Carreras is a little TOO overwhelmed, and I would have preferred one of the other two tenors, probably Domingo (Luciano, you're just too fat for this role!).  However, Carreras does pretty well, given that he plays a man powerless to escape the femaelstrom that is Carmen.  Mitchell and especially Ramey are excellent, given that all roles revolve around Carmen.  At least Ramey gets to sing about being a toreador, and he takes every advantage of the opportunity to shine.
All the while, Levine and his fine orchestra make me rejoice that I plugged the DVD player's audio cables into my stereo. It costs NOTHING to do this, folks, and it isn't difficult, either -- why pop for $400 for a ""home theatre"" kit?  No stereo? Forty bucks or so will get you a subwoofer and two good speakers to plug into your TV's (or laptop's!) earphone jack.
I disagree with reviewers who liked the video quality.  In many parts of this production, the dark picture areas have lots of light-colored noise about every dozen frames or so, with less pronounced noisy frames in between, producing a flicker about two or three times every second.  I find this annoying and distracting.  Something similar happens when I am not careful how I scan a dark 35mm slide with my film scanner, but I know how to deal with it.  The Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft certainly also knows how to deal with it, so why didn't they?  Sehr schlampig, meine Herrn!  It's also not all that hard to write a program to help eliminate pixels that misbehave (see, DG, some opera freaks are computer freaks, too). The extras, as on all DG oper(ett)a DVD's are pretty limited.  The choices for menu languages are limited to English and . . . (are you ready for this?) . . . (Are you sure?)  . . . CHINESE!  Wer zum Teufel hat sich denn DAS ausgedacht?!
The artistic aspects, happily, still make this a great DVD.  I have not seen the Domingo / Migenes production, and it may be even better, but you'll probably like this one quite a bit.",1006473600,65,2974,4.648183556405353
372159,5,6301821122,"I am prompted to write this review to correct what I perceive as a misleading previous review.  This is a sumptuous production from the Met.  The special strong points of the production, as I see it are the usual excellent Met orchestra, sets and acting, the excellent childrens' chorus, the quality of the secondary characters Micaela (Leona Mitchell) and Escamillo (Samuel Ramey), AND the quality of the singers Carmen (Agnes Baltsa) and Don Jose (Jose Carreras).  I found the singing of Don Jose relatively accurate but, more important, the style of singing and the acting seem almost perfect.  Carmen is also extremely well played.  The singing is quite accurate and the amount of energy and management of the mix of low and upper registers is quite impressive.  I have almost no reservations about this excellent production.",1004918400,51,829,5.0588235294117645
372160,3,6301821122,"This video is second to the movie with Placido and Julia as far as enjoying the opera goes.  Sam Ramey and Leona Mitchell do outshine the two principals of Baltsa and Carreras who are credible performers but certainly not thrilling.  Jose was having difficulty, as usual, trying make his instrument heard in that big house, shaking like a wet puppy from the effort.  Trying hard but always straining, making it a video best for his fans.  I've never really cared for Agnes much and she didn't change my mind here either.  Have this on LD and feel it is worth having in my collection as I liked the production which is gone now.  The other videos of Ewing, Covent Garden and Bumbry's version are also OK but the movie is still my favorite.",997660800,7,738,4.511278195488722
372161,5,6301821122,"Agnes Baltsa really steals the show with a seductive, passionate Carmen, and Ramey is phenomenal as Escamillo as well.  Carreras is appropriately tortured as Don Jose with an excellent performance.  The video quality of _Carmen_ is slightly better than the other (excellent) DG DVD releases.  Of course, the uncompressed audio is superb as well, and James Levine can do little wrong with the NYP.

372162,5,6301821122,"This outstanding work is given no better a performance than here from the principles and the fine Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus. The role of Carmen is sung with a fiery passion by the very powerful mezzo of Agnes  Baltsa. Her interaction with Carreras is emotionally powerful as well as  musically satisfying. Special mention must be given to the wonderful  interpretation of the role of Don Jose by Carreras- the best interpretation  available in audio today( note the brilliant recording with Karajan). He is  vocally poweful in the finale of Act three as well as exquisite in the  Flower Song with a soaring B-flat sung pianissimo. He totally identifies  with the character( as in all his roles really). James Levine and the  Orchestra provide impressive accompaniment, providing a pillow for the  principles(Levine's interpretation is less rigid than Maazel but not as  creative as Karajan). Regardless of this , the performance is indicative of  what a night at the opera should be.",928886400,53,997,5.130434782608695

372253,5,6301821122,"Carmen has always held a special place in my soul.  In the 50's it was Simionato & Stevens, in the 60's it was Price & Callas, in the 70's it was Horne & Berganza and in the 80' Baltsa & Norman.  Quite a long list and it definitely is not complete!  Baltsa is a sexy, almost vulgar Carmen, in other words, perfect for the part.  Price was much better vocally; technically perfect, but sterile.  Baltsa is the perfect mix.  There has been no better Carmen in my lifetime.  Carreras is sublime, no one has ever bettered his flower song, I love the b4 sung pianissimo, as written.  Ramey, as usual, is Mr. Machismo and in very fine voice (This a high tessitura for a basso).  Levine conducts with spirit, but not at lightning speed.  Overall it is as near perfect as you can get.  Buy the DVD, as this same cast is not on CD (Jose van Dam pales compared to Ramey.",1334880000,,860,4.246913580246914
372254,5,6301821122,"Until recently I had never believed there would be a Carmen to equal Rise Stevens, and then there was Agnes Baltsa.  She knows exactly who Carmen was .. not a schoolgirl, Carmen has been around for awhile, she has a miserable life working in that factory but makes the most of whatever is on offer.  Neither is she a fool, as the role has recently been sung.  And Baltsa has the voice to make it work, being easily the best mezzo ever.  Jose Carreras is the perfect choice for Don Jose and his health had nothing to do with any of it.  He didn't write the role, but he played it to perfection, better than anyone I've ever seen.  Leona Mitchell is, at long last, a truly great Micaela .. not the soppy nitwit who so often drags the rest of it down, this one is memorable for being strong enough to fit right in with Baltsa and Carreras, not something you can say for very many others in the role. Even if Carmen isn't among your favorites, you really should have this one just for the perfect combination of voices.",1330041600,6,1015,4.287958115183246
372315,5,6301821122,"I had seen this outstanding Met performance x-number of times before and finally bought it on DVD. Contrary to some reviewers I found this a crisp, clear and altogether flawless DVD transfer. There isn't a speck of dirt on it and no flicker anywhere.[As mentioned by the reviewer ""irreverent"". Das hat mit schlampig nichts zu tun. Vielleicht ist es Ihr Equipment, Herr Irreverent?]

Elsewhere someone complained about occasional electronic dirt in the dark scenes, commonly known as ""snow"". My dear Sir, It is supposed to BE snow! Act III takes place in the mountains, it is cold there and it is SNOWING. You can hardly blame Deutsche Grammophon for the stage-snow.
All in all this is the best ""Carmen"" I have ever seen. Orchestra, production, singers, all top notch; although I might have wished for a different Escamillo. Mr. Ramey just isn't Spanish, no matter what costume you put him in.
I found the last 7 or 8 minutes to be an absolute heartbreaker. Especially in view of what happened to Sr. Carreras only a few months later.

I'm glad I bought this ""Carmen"". It's worth twice the price it's going for.",1329350400,3,1110,4.776041666666667
372316,5,6301821122,"Bought this particular Carmen because I remembered it as being one of the most enjoyable evenings at the Met. Young and pre-cancerous Carreras is by far the most consumate passionate Don Jose I have seen, Baltsa definitely convincing, and Ramey, ah Ramey, aaahhhh the young Ramey!!!! Jimmy's lead of the orchestra is simply pluperfect fire. The DVD's quality is quite good.  And yes, I do recommend it.",1293580800,,402,5.0
372317,4,6301821122,"I bought this DVD because I had seen Agnes Baltsa in ""Carmen"" back in 1971 or 1972, in a Houston Grand Opera production.  She was INCREDIBLE--I had never heard a more beautiful voice!

BUT, this current Met DVD has some problems.  The worst problem is that the singers sound like they are in a different room than the orchestra.  There is no integration of the vocal and orchestral sound--the speaking and singing seem ""muffled"" by comparison to the clarity of the orchestra.

The cast is great, but Agnes Baltsa is not the most beautiful Carmen in the world, which makes the story less credible.  She certainly has the best Carmen voice ever, and she is one MEAN b---- as Carmen!  Jose Carreras is, as expected, the perfect Don Jose.  But Samuel Ramey is not very convincing as Escamillo.

On the plus side, the orchestra is FANTASTIC, as are the set designs.  There are huge numbers of people on stage at times, so it is quite a spectacle--all choreographed very well.

I enjoy watching operas on DVD, because you can turn on the ""close-captioned"" subtitles in English.  However, most opera DVD's also have distracting close-up shots that show singers grimacing (or, even, spitting!) or doing other peculiar gestures with their bodies.  That is certainly true of this Met DVD, as well.  But, that's theatre!!",1265760000,4,1310,4.816143497757848
372318,5,6301821122,"This is a fine MET production from 1988 (omg, I remember the first time I watched it on TV... now I feel old!)

Many people know the story of Carmen- it has be imitated, duplicated, made into movies, operas, musicals, etc. As I watched it recently, there's this moment in the first act where you have that ""love so right can turn out to be so wrong"" premonition. You know that even though she is enticing (and loose) and he is handsome (and dumb) this is going to turn out VERY badly. As I watched the 2nd act, I thought of the ""games people play"" where she basically says in both Acts I & II that ""if you loved me, you'd do this."" Guys AND Gals... don't ever fall for that line! That's your red flag, get outta that relationship! Well, Don Jos isn't that alert, because he's been intoxicated by what apparently was the ""Legends of the Fall"" syndrome. So many women and just one is being constantly fought over!?! OK. In Act IV when she says she loves Escamillo, I'm thinking ""and if they told you wolverines make good house pets?"" (like who'd believe this chick? she changes lovers like some people change their oil, every 6 months!) And in the end, you just feel sorry for them both- him the desperate, pathetic stalker; her the ill-fated, resolute and honest slut. jk ;)

On to this DVD. It's conducted by Jimmy Levine & he does his usual wonderful job of conducting the MET Orchestra. They do nicely too, nice dynamics and overall excellent pacing.

Our Carmen is Agnes Baltsa (a Nia Vardalos look alike- one could wish for a more attractive Carmen, but like Bette Davis, she makes you believe she is the most desired woman on the block) and she sings with passion and power. She has a *very* solid lower register and aside from a few uncomfortable moments at the beginning of Act II, for the most part she sounds completely secure in this role. She also has ringing high notes that are just out of the ballpark. I would wish for some more dynamics and shading. In the Act III scene where she sings her aria, ""En vain pour viter les rponses amres"" she is all loud. I don't mind the comatose facial expression because it suits the resignation of the song- but all loud is just brutal- which most of the time in this role, is what Carmen is.

Our Don Jos is Jos Carreras in his prime before he became ill. His singing is mellifluous and powerful. He also shades and uses his dynamics to great effect. He is also quite a handsome and dashing figure and can act. Pretty much the ideal Don Jos! His aria, ""La fleur que tu m'avais jete"" is so fabulous- his is my favorite of all tenors in this aria. And his act IV performance will completely rivet you in your seat. The 2 leads actually look a bit in the throes still of the performance at curtain call. That's a pretty tough Act IV to do- vicious and brutal (kinda like taking a curtain call after playing Martha & George in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"")

Our Escamillo is Samuel Ramey who became quite famous in this role- and with good reason. It is well suited to his voice and he also cuts a dashing figure on stage. But let's face it, dramatically, the part is just a subplot. The Michala is sung by Leona Mitchell and she does quite nicely. Her best part is in the duet with Don Jos in Act I where she is all sweetness and looks the part too. She is so lovely on stage; it is easy at times to overlook some flaws. Her aria is a little less convincing. Her diction is terrible and it's when she sings it goes out the window- her spoken lines are much easier to understand. She also gets a bit hooty at times.

All the other roles, Frasquita, Mercds and Morals, etc. are nicely done by all. The staging is great, lighting good, the costumes beautiful and it's a dream chorus.

This is a very good Carmen- it's won't be everyone's because Baltsa's Carmen is a bit on the harsh side, sexy but more dangerous than sexy- and the same can be said for her singing. But I would think few would find a better Don Jos than Carreras. Recommended :)",1244678400,4,3997,4.3355614973262036
372319,4,6301821122,"For ages I have been familiar with this opera, and once upon a time designed costumes for it, too. This version was somewhat different, but very good. The settings didn't always appear as though it was the cigarette factory or the caf of Lilas Pastias, but the acting was good and the singing excellent. Not a recent production, it still shows how good Jose Carreras is. Unfortunately Samuel Ramey didn't seem as convincing as Escamillo as he could have. Though a smaller role, it is nevertheless very important to the story.

The music of deutsche grammophon has always been well known and looked for and overall it is hard to fault the Metropolitan and these performers. James Levine leads the ever fabulous orchestra as well. I give it at least 4 stars.",1207612800,3,756,4.7272727272727275
372320,4,6301821122,"This MET production in 1987 is in many ways illustrious: two top opera stars in the lead roles, big staging and festive choruses plus good dancers.

Agnes Baltsa shined vocally here, but really, Carmen is a bit of a stretch for her in 1987 visually.

I have heard Samuel Ramey elsewhere, and must say that his Escamillo is somewhat mediocre in this production.  His two big arias lacked charisma, especially when you have Jose Carreras as Don Jose.  It would be difficult to convince the audience that this toreador is the man that Carmen would prefer over Don Jose!

Jose Carreras is in his absolute prime here - big arias sweetly sung, physically convincing, ardent in acting (he is not consistently passionate elsewhere). Most of all, he has the right characterisation for this weak-minded Don Jose. Rather than ranking him behind Domingo in this role, I would rather opt Carreras as the best Don Jose of his era.",1176854400,14,916,4.772151898734177
372321,3,6301821122,"If you are looking for a version with excellent voices, this is it!!!

If you are looking for a great ""theatrical"" production, this is it!!!

BUT I must say that I found a terrible issue in this version: Carmen (Baltsa) and Escamillo (Ramey) were not Carmen and Escamillo.

CARMEN, as far as I understand these character... she must be sensual, sexy, seductive, graceful, not rigid but loose while dancing, surrounding with its charisma, mysterious and at the same time cold, jealous and interested. Carmen must astonish like a gypsy. Baltsa was never Sensual nor graceful. Yes, she has an EXTRAORDINARY volcal interpretation... and musically is just perfect... that's Puccinis and the actual conductor work. But I never saw Carmen. You must fall in love with Carmen even though you know that that love is going to take you to the perdition. She must HYPNOTIZE us... but Baltza couldn't do it.... it's a shame. I saw a Carmen so rigid and so plain... that even though she sings excellent... I missed Carmen.

ESCAMILLO, Oh my God!!!... the male version of these Carmen. Where is that charming ""Toreador""?... he never showed up. ESCAMILLO must be charming, elegant and seductive. Ramey was just somene there singing with no Toreador feeling.

DON JOSE and MICHAELLA... Oh Yes!... great performances, great voices,great actor skills, great feelings of their character. Excellent Excellent Excellent!!!

Musically, these version of Carmen is GREAT... but... ""Where is Carmen and Escamillo""?...",1170892800,39,1490,5.1875
372322,5,6301821122,"If you are relatively new to opera as I am, Baltsa's performance of Carmen may have to grow on you - as it did on me - but you'll have no trouble admiring and appreciating Carreras' Don Jose character right away. (The role is one of his specialties.)  Back to Baltsa: You'll have to get over her physical apperance -Carmen is supposed to be 17!- as a temptress
and then you will enjoy her portrayal. Magnificent voice!
  Samuel Ramey is dripping with confidence as Escamillo, the bullfighter, and his voice is really nice.
  Leona Mitchell's voice is less than perfect in this live performance, but it is a voice I would be greatful to own.
She is a sweet Micaela, (The girl who loves Don Jose) and is rather convincing in her big aria in act 3.
  There is a wonderful supporting cast, although some of the older women in the Met chorus will gross you out in their 'cigarette-girl' costumes in Act 1!
  And now what the Carreras fans are waiting for: How was Carreras in this performance? It would take an entire book of positive adjectives to describe his stellar, passionate performance. Here you will find a great artist -in real life on the brink of being diagnosed with leukemia- singing his heart and soul out with fire, urgency, and love. He puts everything into this role and the audience -you & I- are richly rewarded!
  Conclusion: Don't miss this one!!!",1142208000,35,1364,4.57201646090535
372323,5,6301821122,"At first I have to say that a lot of operas often happen to have a wonderful tenor and a really bad soprano or vice versa. This is absolutely not the case here. Both mezzo soprano Agnes Baltsa and tenor Jos Carreras are doing a brilliant job with both their singing and acting. I think they both have a stage presence that very few can beat. Agnes Baltsa possesses a crystal clear voice, but she can also belt if that's what it takes to make the final outcome more believable. Jos Carreras' voice contains so much beauty; it's full of emotions, sensual and with that irresistible hint of honey. Like Baltsa he can also sacrifize beauty to enhance his performance.

Agnes Baltsa is just so sensual as Carmen it's no wonder Don Jos is powerless against her. I love the scene in first act where they spot each other for the first time and Don Jos is trying his best not to show any interest in Carmen who is surrounded by a crowd of eager men, but still we see him watching her out of the corner of his eye and Carmen is putting on a display trying to attract his attention. The way she's taking the rose from down her cleavage and throwing it on Don Jos is most seductive. And he's obviously overwhelmed by this woman so full of sex-appeal. The sweet and innocent Michaela doesn't stand a chance compared to the wild and seductive Carmen. Baltsa's singing is beautiful; it's filled with her usual energy and involvement and I just love her version of ""pres de ramparts de Seville"". And in ""non, tu ne m'aime pas"" she's so persuasive that it's no wonder Jos almost is giving in to her pleas about him leaving the army. She is undoubtedly my favourite Carmen.

Jos Carreras is perfect as Don Jos. Some reviewers have claimed that his acting is a bit wooden, but I disagree. He's playing a nave and shy, young man falling in love for the first time and by the way, he's also a soldier and they hardly go dancing all around the place. Like always Carreras is pouring his heart and soul into his singing. Even if this performance was very close to his leukaemia treatment I think he sounds wonderful. Just listen to the ""flower aria"" that's sung with such emotion and ends up like a gentle love song. (And I would have sacrificed a lot to be Carmen, having Don Jos Carreras looking at me the way he did that moment...) He's also outstanding in the final act where Don Jos ends up killing Carmen. They both are, actually. Don Jos is at first trying his best to persuade her into coming back to him, because he's still in love with her. And his rage at the end is very understandable, because I think we all can identify with him when he realizes that he has ruined his life because of her and in the end she refuses him. His cry (Ma Carmen, adore) after having killed Carmen makes my hair stand on end. It comes from the very deepest of his soul. During curtain call you will see Carreras completely drained of emotion. And I feel almost the same after having watched this version of Carmen. The final 10-15 minutes of this opera are worth the price of the dvd alone.

Leona Mitchell is a very sweet, but slightly nervous Michaela. Escamillo is portrayed by a brash Samuel Ramey. He has a rich, dark voice and his singing is very good. But even so, if I was Carmen I would stick to Don Jos. The rest of the supporting cast are excellent and they all make this version of Carmen very enjoyable. If you like me, happen to like Baltsa and Carreras I wouldn't hesitate buying the dvd.",1126828800,26,3472,4.371517027863777
372324,4,6301821122,"As the previous poster mentioned, this production was very close to the famous tenor's Leukemia treatment, which is unfortunate, because there are elements of absolute bliss created by carreras and other parts not so. When he really gets into the singing he is the emobiment of passion, emotion and drama, but he also seems rather stiff in parts, both in his movement and in acting(which is evident in the many spoken lines).
Agnes Balsta playing Carmen was great, a beautiful voice and probably the best actor on stage. Samuel Ramey sings Escamillo very well, but perhaps a little more emotion rather than merely singing is desired. Leona Mitchell was of course excellent, as was Levine and the Met orchestra.
This production stirs within a great respect for the opera profession, but there is an underlying hesitance perhaps the somewhat aged cast fail slightly to create the strong emotions of lust, jelousy and rage that are the centre of this opera. I have the fullest respect for carreras, and I really enjoyed this production.
But overall it was great to listen to and watch this traditionally styled Carmen.",1105488000,10,1115,4.967914438502674

He is 42 but looks 25 - a perfect Don Jose - innocent, manly, handsome and passionate.
His ""la Fleur que tu m'avais jeteee"" - the greatest love song in all music, - is unforgettable!

Agnes Baltsa, on the other hand, looks every one of her 44 years but sings, dances and acts beautifully.
Her Carmen is more  like an experienced woman of the world who has seen it all, than an out of control gypsy girl..
But still, she is the best Carmen I have yet seen, and at times she is indeed girlish and charming.",1490918400,2,570,4.080357142857143
