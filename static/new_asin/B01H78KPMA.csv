7781112,5,B01H78KPMA,Awesome. Such compassion in a serious  undertaking.,1474848000,2,51,6.285714285714286
8764813,5,B01H78KPMA,"I watched this TWICE on my flight back to the US from Beijing. I couldn't believe a practice like this existed in which people show such dedication and tenacity over a very lengthy religious journey. Im so impressed with the story itself and the production. Give it a watch, or two!",1526342400,,282,4.549019607843137
8764814,5,B01H78KPMA,"Quiet, dramatic, beautifully shot over the period of a year, and unbelievable that it is without the use of professional actors.",1516147200,,128,5.142857142857143
8764815,5,B01H78KPMA,Fascinating and beautiful,1503964800,,25,7.666666666666667
8764816,4,B01H78KPMA,"Paths of the Soul is a rather spare film, very light on dialogue.  But if you are interested in seeing something of village life in Tibet, landscapes, and the back alleys of Lhasa, this is the film for you.  The lead actors, while we never get to know them all that well, are fascinating to watch and express a lot through their expressions--or lack thereof.",1503014400,,358,4.492307692307692
8764817,5,B01H78KPMA,"I grew up in Chengdu, which is near Tibet, and I have been to Tibet.  Now I live in the United States.  This movie is real life in Tibet, about how people live and worship. It brings back many of my childhood memories.  Wonderful movie and beautifully done.",1499731200,,257,4.3125
8764818,4,B01H78KPMA,"An interesting take on a traditional Tibetan family going on pilgrimage. It shows that it is possible to retain a cultural identity even when one's old culture and religion are under threat. Very moving and beautifully photographed. It is a docudrama and apparently, most of the people are nonactors. It is Tibetan for Tibetans and not a western european take.  A view of Tibet from the inside and on Tibetan terms. Well worth seeing and contemplating.",1497744000,,452,4.947368421052632
8764819,5,B01H78KPMA,"A Super movie. Beautifully depicting these Tibetans' Impressive spiritual journey, both literally and figuratively.",1491523200,,115,7.285714285714286
8764820,1,B01H78KPMA,"Nothing against the Tibetan people who were made to appear in this Chinese propaganda film but that is just what it is. Look closely knowing this and you will see the props and the abundant food and pretend freedom and the fear behind their eyes.
 Attempting to show relative religious freedom and good life in Tibet where in reality, the people are not allowed even the right to lift their heads and speak freely. If you want to see a real movie about what's really going on then please get the movie 'What Remais of Us'. Then you will see real nomadics other Tibetans living in the reality of Tibet, the world's largest prison.",1490313600,4,629,4.517543859649122
8764821,5,B01H78KPMA,Excellent Movie. You are on the journey with them.,1482278400,2,50,4.666666666666667
8764822,5,B01H78KPMA,"Extraordinary film about faith, family and of the great people of Tibet. This is a movie that I will return to from time to time in the coming years. May they have more pilgrimages. May us all.",1479513600,3,193,4.243243243243243
