8090090,5,B000BOAUVO,Bought this for my dad who is in his 70's and housebound. He really enjoyed it. He said the video quality was good and it was good performances. Sometimes it's hit or miss with this type of video. They may advertise a couple of well known songs or singers but then the rest of the dvd is filled with singers no one has heard of...  Apparently that was not the case with this DVD since my dad loved it!,1473638400,,401,4.075949367088608
