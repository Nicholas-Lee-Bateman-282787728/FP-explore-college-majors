8079166,5,B000ARXFKK,"I love Soupy Sales. All the goofiness, the genuine fun he seemed to have while working and of course, Pookie. How could you not love that?
But here's a warning for you. You may remember the episode where Soupy's crew surprised him with a naked woman behind the door. When the show was aired, all that show was broadcast was Soupy's reaction to the naked woman. Soupy believed at the time that the naked woman was being shown to the broadcast audience and his reaction reflects it, especially when you consider the time period the show was shown in. Soupy's reaction is hilarious, but you might want to take the brief nudity in consideration if you plan to show this to your family.
Otherwise, this dvd shows Soupy at his peak.
If you like Soupy Sales and you can tolerate the brief nudity, this is a dvd for you. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.",1258416000,,852,4.364779874213837
8079167,5,B000ARXFKK,"Soupy Sales was always my favorite TV star. I was lucky enough to live in New York for some of the time he was on TV there on weekday afternoons, and his show was the biggest must-see of all (and considering that the time period was like TV heaven for kids my age, that's saying something). This DVD has selections from Soupy's 1970s revival of his classic show, and unlike so many other revivals, Soupy still had it. These shows are just as good as his classic B&W shows plus they have the advantage of being well-preserved and in color. Short of a complete series set (which probably will never happen), this is a wonderful way to re-live the times when one of the funniest men of all graced the airwaves.",1256256000,2,707,4.404580152671755
