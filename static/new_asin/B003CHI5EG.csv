4107868,5,B003CHI5EG,"The only complaint I have is that the awards are not in chronological order. However, it has award performances from when he was a teenager until his death. It shows his acceptance speeches and different tributes done for him. The DVD is 3 hours long. If you love Michael, then I think this is a DVD for you as I have found nothing like it anywhere before.",1278374400,22,356,4.3283582089552235
4107869,3,B003CHI5EG,"I think this is the first actual review of this DVD since it was released. I'm just going to share some thoughts. Well, the program length is about 3 hours long. The clips are in random order. It should have been ordered chronologically.

  What I really enjoyed was Michael in some of the 1970s award programs. There's no music here, just him presenting and/or receiving awards. So, don't think you're getting the performances from the awards shows. Often, the quality is quite poor, but given the age of some of the material, that's understandable. But the quality for some clips is quite good.

  I enjoyed seeing all the ""Thriller"" Grammy clips together (only fair quality). But when Michael received an award for ""We Are the World,"" the quality was excellent. Most of the clips have Asian subtitles (Japanese? Korean??), so I suppose that was the source for this DVD. I've seen quite a few of these on youtube but it's fun to sit down and see a lot of them at once.

  Award shows include American Music Awards, Grammy's, Soul Train, NAACP, World Music Awards, various MTV and video awards, a Japanese Legend award (made me cry--an older Michael was on the verge of tears accepting this award). Dates range from around 1974 (with Donny Osmond!) to 2000s. Again, there are NO PERFORMANCES included here. I would like to know if the ""Michael Jackson Fan"" collection includes this disc.....(?) Hoping someone will review that one too.",1277942400,53,1436,4.804878048780488
4107870,5,B003CHI5EG,"I understand your frustration at not having more information about the content of this product - I also wish they would add a good description.  But please, giving it a bad review isn't going to help anything.  I did order it and am hoping that it's as wonderful as MJ has always been.  Fingers crossed!  Keep the L.O.V.E alive.",1276560000,7,328,4.508474576271187
4107871,3,B003CHI5EG,"Without a detailed description of this product, there is no way I would purchase it.  How do we know it's not just another substandard cash-in on Michael Jackson's name and fame, God rest His soul.",1275436800,12,197,4.628571428571429
4107872,1,B003CHI5EG,"Yes, we can see the title of this DVD, but I still think it should, giva a synopsis regarding the content ... Just as most other books and DVD's have in this section.

Sorry, but I won't consider buying unless more info is added!

4107873,5,B003CHI5EG,I love Michael more the more I learn of him. There will never be another Michael! I loved him as an entertainer and even more as a person. He never let fame or the meanness of people who didn't understand him change who he was.,1386201600,,227,4.066666666666666

4107877,5,B003CHI5EG,"For those who cannot get enough of Michael Jackson, this is a great addition to your collection.

4107881,5,B003CHI5EG,"This does not even cover all the awards he received during his life...and after...but really illustrates how talented and charitable he was.

I would recommend this to fans or anyone who would like to know about his acheivements.

The DVD was as described and arrived in a timely manner.",1351296000,,287,4.836734693877551
4107882,5,B003CHI5EG,"i love this dvd as it contains all his awards. you can hear his angelic voice speak, and his words of wisdom. although not in chronological order, as long as MJ is in it, its worth watching. =)",1348704000,,193,4.105263157894737

4107885,4,B003CHI5EG,"I loved watching this collection. It was awesome to see Michael win so many awards over the years and also so many at one awards assembly in one night! Truly the King of Pop, he handles all of the award acceptances with poise, modesty, and thankfulness to his fans.  Any MJ fan would love it.
Only reason why I did not give 5 stars was due to quality. Parts of the dvd were fuzzy though not at any fault of the seller. There was no HD back in the day! But still really good stuff.",1339891200,,480,4.052631578947368

4107888,1,B003CHI5EG,"Not sure why the rest of the reviews are speaking so highly about the Michael Jackson Awards Collections. Because that's exactly what this DVD is a collection of M.J's receiving awards throughout his career on stage. Not so much fun for a real M.J, fan who enjoys his performances not so much his speeches.",1304899200,,306,4.685185185185185
4107889,5,B003CHI5EG,I truly enjoyed watching this collection of M.J.awards. It was a lot of fun and will bring back a lot of great memories of not just M.J. but a lot of other stars. Truly a must have for your collection. Thank You Amazon.,1300492800,2,219,4.116279069767442
4107890,3,B003CHI5EG,"I have or have at least viewed almost every MJ dvd/video out there.  I purchased this one because there isn't much out there of him winning any awards.  Although it was nice to see him win and watch him in those moments, the editing on this dvd is poor.  They cut clips out and splice together the ceremonies and they are all out of order datewise.  I wouldn't recommend this dvd unless you are a die hard fan and want to see everything there is.  It was just ok in my book.  But then - anything with MJ is at least ok.",1299456000,,519,4.03921568627451

However, the video production was not very good, I expected  better. This seems like

4107893,1,B003CHI5EG,"Amazon should not be selling this video. The quality is terrible. It appears to be home recordings of events that were recorded, primarily, from Japanese TV.It does not include spme of teh really great awards and presentations, like the 25th year of MTV, 25th year of Motown, etc. It is a waste of money and makes me feel totally different about Amazon.",1292457600,2,353,4.709677419354839

4107896,3,B003CHI5EG,"Well..I was not too excited about the quality of the disc, but it is always good to see Michael Jackson again..I miss him..this world is Strange without him..I love michael..I just wish the quality of this DVD was as exciting as he was. All this time Michael Jackson was innocent & he stood for truth. Now we are stuck with people who can't even sing & a bunch of I guess semi wannabes.. here's to my friend Michael Jackson(The original Classic & more).",1288915200,2,453,4.469879518072289
4107897,5,B003CHI5EG,"This DVD was an eye opener.  Michael was a creative genius and worthy of the title.  He was adored by fans and peers alike.  He won every conceivable award in the 1980's up to the mid-90's.  The quality was okay considering much of the footage was 25 years old.  I have read so much about how Michael was built up by the music industry only to be torn down.  He could not have achieved more by the time he was 30 years old.  But he ran up against some very dangerous people in the music industry who just didn't find that level of fame acceptable.  I was surprised at so much footage of his ""fan thrown"" 2003 birthday party which was not really an ""award"" (consumed about 15 minutes of the footage); however, I'm always impressed by Michael's loyal fan base and his appreciation and love shown to his fans.  I highly recommend this DVD to everyone who wants to know how really hard Michael worked to achieve his level of stardom.  He was a once in a lifetime entertainer and humanitarian (many of the awards shown on the DVD are for his charitable and philanthropic endeavors.  And this DVD is not a Sony product (or any of its affiliates).

Okay, so here we are in 2012 and I've viewed this Awards Collection video again, and here is an update.  As we approach the 3rd anniversary of Michael's death, I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE all younger viewers to get this DVD, as it's a true testament to Michael's early accolades and longevity in the music industry.  In retrospect since my initial review, I have grown to more fully appreciate Michael's musical genius along with the philanthropic endeavors of the man himself.  YOUNGER VIEWERS AND FANS, if you want to become further acquainted with the genius of Michael Jackson, I urge you to view/purchase this 3 hour video showcasing Michael's accomplishments and accolades while still in his teens.  One of a kind to be remembered forever.",1285718400,,1880,4.6006006006006
4107898,5,B003CHI5EG,"This is a great DVD of Michael receiving awards, etc.  I will watch it over and over again.  If you are a fan, you will definitely want this one in your MJ library.",1283040000,,164,3.9393939393939394

4107900,2,B003CHI5EG,"Sorry, but I was very unhappy with this dvd. You can tell that it was badly made. It was alright to see some footage from years ago but the quality was poor. Should have saved my money on something better.",1281225600,,205,4.15
4107901,5,B003CHI5EG,"Hi,
Got this as part of A Fans Collection, 4 dvd set and its my favourite so far along with The Archive and Documentary Collection disc, not sure what to say that has not been said already, except this is essential viewing, so pleased to have these all on one disc, shows all of MJs awards and is over 3 hours long, many special moments to reminisce over, thanks,",1278460800,5,363,4.27536231884058
4107902,5,B003CHI5EG,"This three hour dvd is worth watching you will walk away with more admiration for the ""king of pop"" Besides the awards you had missed through the years of mj is now at your finger tips. Even though this video isn't in chronological order, it does however capture MJ. It starts off in the 70's when Mj was a presenter on the A.M.A awards. This includes him presenting with Donny Osmand and other fellow artist. Mj also gets the help of his little sister Janet when presenting a couple of awards. Chris tucker giving Mj the aritst of the century award-real cute.

MJ honoring Barry Gordy. Then it goes into the 80's of MJ solo career and winning awards. LIke favorite soul single form ""don't stop till you get enough"" and of couse soul album ""off the wall"" you see rare clips of Mj and Diana Ross competing for favorite album, as well as winning soul male artist. Great clips. And of course the album of the history, Mj winning all those awards for thriller, it is so nice to have the entire of him speaking. Eddy Murphy presenting MJ with the pioneer award and another-it is so cute to watch this clip, this is when Eddie talks about MJ ""BAd"" album accomplishments. It goes into Mj winning ""remember the time"" song and he has an injured ankle, and Eddie giving him a bad time about it..

And of course MJ winning favorite pop/rock album-Dangerous, then it goes into the 2002 world art awards, oh and my favorite Mj winning the video of the year ""scream"" and he has the cute hair style, and Janet comes up to the podium and does most of the talking-Excellent, But when he receives the award from Morgan Freeman-I got teary eyed b/c MJ was so humbled by this mans presents and honored it was just touching. And we can't forget MJ presenting James Brown with the life time achievment award and how his speach made you cry..There is so much more awards given to Mj for his humantarian work, Millium achievement award, and when he is presenting award at the NAACP and he talks from his heart about the ordeal he was going through - Very touching

There is a clip about him talking about his ""heal the world"" foundation in its entirety-excellent, yet cute he talks about the importance of balancing a family and career, then he goes into trying to get a date in..
There is an after party show inwhich Mj goes into great detail of his goals,accomplishments, and how he truly appreciated the fans support during trying times..It last for a good half in hour, he also explains a bit more on Tommy Mottala. When Mj received his legend award in Japan he got teary eyed and it was humbling to see. There is also Mj at James Brown funeral giving a brief speech, short and to the point..

But it ends with his final curtain call ""This is it"" you can't help but cry, knowing this man had left one heck of a legacy, and what a profound career. I love my dvd, it has been remastered although their are a couple of clips that are okay, the majority of it is great quality. Who ever put this together realized shotty work don't sell. I am glad I purchased it, I can go back in time and see mj as his finest, giving and receiving awards, listening to his voice, seeing that beautiful smile that lights up the room. Knowing he loved from the depth of his soul..

I promise you won't be disappointed it is one for your collection. Thanks Mj for the memories, may we make you proud..",1278374400,105,3359,4.393890675241158
