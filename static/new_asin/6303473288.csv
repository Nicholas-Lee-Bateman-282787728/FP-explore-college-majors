7848264,5,6303473288,"This is good; however, I ordered because it was supposed to contain a short Irish film, ""Return to Glennescaul"", which it doesn't.",1523318400,,130,4.954545454545454
7848265,3,6303473288,I saw this on a PBS station.  It is three separate stories.  Orson Wells narrates and is in the third one.  But the first story about a painting in a museum.  The other two aren't as good.,1522195200,,188,4.0
7848266,4,6303473288,Two out of three were better. The third one with Orson Wells was okay.,1435622400,,70,4.071428571428571
7848267,5,6303473288,"This is a review of the newly released Odeon all-zone version in the blue & white case. It will run on your player. The Twilight Zone may exist because Rod Serling saw this in 1955. I am at a lost for words in  describing just how weird and wonderful the first story is. When the gods of cinema part the clouds for a moment, this is what you reach for. A Masterpiece! The extra isn't bad either...Orson Welles Return To Glennascaul, yet another ghost story, long lost. Picture quality is fine.",1316822400,,493,4.417582417582418
7848268,5,6303473288,"This film contains a trio of separate tales :
The first of them is the very original Ghostly doings in an art gallery . Through a so living picture the guardian of the gallery will go to another level of reality when he decides to cross a forbidden line. The otherness will establish its own codes in this wasteland .
The second tale turns around two suspects when a gril is murdered . Suspense and high caliber tension along the work.
And finally we have to the giant Orson Welles playing a weird role : apowerful lord will be plagued for the memory of a House member he ahs humiliated in public.
This collection of tales have become in a glorious reference for the future cinema connoiseurs . And may be well the inspirational motive for the creators of Twilight Zone ten yeras after .
The powerful and charismatic presence of Welles makes of it a must see , but the other two are watchable works .
What else do you need for let you sweeping for those botabvle British directors in a terror fable?
Chapeaux!",1102723200,2,1009,4.43010752688172
7848269,4,6303473288,"This is classic movies at their best.  All three short story's are great, but the last one is a delight to watch over, and over again.  Even if your not a Welles fan you'll like these stories (He is only in the last story.)",949536000,6,223,4.045454545454546
