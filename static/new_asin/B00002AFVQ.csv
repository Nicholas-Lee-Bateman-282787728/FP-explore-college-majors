A car drops off a man with a shotgun. Will there be a wedding? Baby Dumpling takes a car out for a drive on the farm. ""Whoopee!"" Can he find a needle in a haystack? Then the credits roll. The alarm clock rings, Daisy gets a reward. The 4th of July draws near, will Dagwood buy firecrackers? Is there danger? Will they eat out? They decide to visit relatives for peace and quiet. ""Throw it out the window."" Wet paint? Is there a trick about asking a question? They get the weekend off. Little Baby Dumpling is pretty smart. But not as smart as Blondie. The train takes them to the country. Will there be a mix-up over the train? A couple gives them a ride.

The beginning scene recurs, the father objects to the wedding. Fireworks for the Fourth? Will Charlie talk to Millie? Baby Dumpling learns a new skill. ""Woo Hoo!"" Does Blondie have an idea to help Charlie. Will this plan go wrong? [It wouldn't be a comedy if it didn't.] Anything that can go wrong does. Is it Blondie's fault? There is a happy accident for Old Man Tucker. Will Dagwood light a match to see what happened? Is there a lesson here?",1250467200,,1123,4.3428571428571425

Back growing up as a kid in the late 1960's and early 1970's they used to show them every weekend and i would watch them with my dad who had watched them himself in the theatres when he was just about my age back in the late 30's and 40's. I always found them hilarious, slapstick fun as a kid and while they don't pack quite the same punch today as they did back then they are still good fun.

This is the 7th entry in the Blondie series.  The Bumbsteads take a trip for 4th of July to Aunt Hannahs ranch and Dagwood is prepared with a load of fireworks.  After missing their train they hitch a ride with a young couple who is planning to elope.  The groom to be, Charlie, is played by a young Glenn Ford!  Blondie decides to help the young lovers elope.  Trouble ensues when Charlie gets hurt and Dagwood has to carry Millie out of her bedroom window instead..only he picks the window of her father by mistake and he is NOT happy.

A funny entry in the series.  Nice to know that men were as goofy about fireworks over 60 years ago as they are today.",1110240000,,1104,4.150234741784038

They decide to go to the country, but there trip isn't exactly trouble-free. Blondie helps a young Glenn Ford get back with his fiancee. The scene after Baby Dumpling drives away in the car, Blondie and the others rush out on the front porch.  There you will see a properly-hung American Flag with only 48 stars. The movie was filmed in 1940.  Alaska and Hawaii had not entered the Union until 1959.  There is your history listen for today. The next film in this series is BLONDIE GOES LATIN.",1044748800,,621,4.576576576576577
