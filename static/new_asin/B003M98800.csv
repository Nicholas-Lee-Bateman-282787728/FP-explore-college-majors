8400226,5,B003M98800,"Wow, this movie surprised the heck out of me.  I wasn't expecting much but I was wrong.  OUTSTANDING movie.  Very underrated, I am surprised it didn't get more play time in the theaters.  Rich kids, drugs, sex, and plot twists.  Good soundtrack to boot including LA punk band X.",1464307200,,278,4.591836734693878

8400228,4,B003M98800,"The movie gets much darker by the end than you expect.  It starts out as an almost formulaic nerdy high school outsider gets an in with the ""cool"" crowd who are more concerned with partying and getting high than anything else.  Then it turns to a very dark unrequited love story.  It is not the typical feel good teen movie that we have really seen since the 1980s.

It is definitely a movie that has a low-budget independent feel to it, despite the presence of Daryl Hannah as Jonah's mother, and Lizzy Caplan who is more well known now due to her role in Masters of Sex.  The writing and acting were good for what the movie was, and all the actors and the characters they played were believable in their roles.  That said, liking any movie such as this will be very subjective so I cannot say it is going to appeal to everyone.

For bonus features there is not a lot.  There is a commentary track on the film with the director and the actor who played Jonah.  There is a 12 minute making of feature, the trailer and a photo gallery.  Not a ton of material, but about what you would expect for the DVD release of an low-budget film.",1431216000,2,1133,4.276995305164319
8400229,5,B003M98800,I was thinking this was just going to be a new teen movie. But it was more then that well done movie with a Very dark end.,1425945600,,122,3.5555555555555554
8400230,2,B003M98800,"I struggled with giving this film only two stars. It had some merit but reviews are relative and I wish I hadn't wasted 90+ minutes of my life watching it. I considered my age of 53 and decided that the film may be more entertaining to my son or daughter.

It's ironic that the only character with a loving parent felt the most alone. He also had depth (choice of his reading material) and a job. The privileged kids were cool and seemingly had everything. These young adults had no jobs, threw parties at their parent's houses and drove BMWs. They hung at parties that most 18 year-olds aren't invited to. I have little doubt that such parties occur but the film's setting is only a reality if you grew up in stereotyped Beverly Hills with stereotyped wealthy detached parents. The underprivileged but loved kid is ostracized by the wealthy cool kids but somehow gets his foot in the door with the in-crowd. He resents his loving mother and makes poor choices. I've seen it before.

In my experience ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and ""Train Spotting"" are closer to reality for most. Then again, I may be showing my age with such a comment.",1356998400,8,1144,4.548543689320389
8400231,5,B003M98800,"I thought this movie was great. I have ADHD but it kept me glued to it the entire time and I had to watch this one more than once like all the other great movies I like. I think the acting was amazing. The guy who played Jonah did some really good acting with this part. I was impressed! It made me think of my own childhood and the years in high school that I wasn't popular either and it always seemed everything the poor kid said wasn't ""good enough"" or cool enough for anyone to take an interest in him except Sarah. Poor Jonah was desperate to get close enough to her and what came so easily to others, never came that way to Jonah. He had to lie about not knowing Sarah's mom was an actress when Sarah finally spoke to Jonah at the high school grad party that he showed up to by himself. Definately could relate to Jonah's shyness and his lacking of social skills in this film. well I could relate to the using drugs and partying too LOL!!!",1348272000,,946,4.146739130434782
8400232,5,B003M98800,"Jonah, a high-school senior who works as a pharmacist's clerk, falls in with the drug-addled, party-hearty group from school.

Although Jonah's social status in school falls considerably short of the popular ranking, he has had his eye on Sara, a girl from the ""in group,"" since freshman year of high school. Opportunistic motives impel Sara, her boyfriend, Troy, and the rest of their cliche to include Jonah, if only superficially, in their racy world which Jonah, likewise, uses to his advantage in pursuing Sara. As his involvement with Sara's friends evolves so does his determination to have Sara for himself, despite her relationship with Troy. One particular incident of cataclysmic proportion ushers in a sub-plot that serves as a platform for the movie.

Although a couple of the peripheral characters might benefit from some elocution lessons to remedy their nearly inaudible mumble-speak, the film's two main stars deliver outstanding performances.  Lizzy Caplan (Sara), who resembles Sarah Jessica Parker as a girl, possesses stunning beauty and deep, soulful facial expressions that communicate wordlessly. John Patrick Amedori, best known for his role on TV's ""Gossip Girl,"" shines in his sympathetic portrayal of a vulnerable person unraveling within the emotional maelstrom of obsessive love.",1323820800,3,1309,5.502487562189055
8400233,5,B003M98800,"this is a great movie!  i like these kind of crazy twisted movies that have you in awe by the end of the movie.  i had a lot of crazy experiences growing up and these kind of movies take me back to those days.  yet those days are not gone, i am just ignorant to them now like most american are.  it is crazy, the number of people in the underworld of using yet can still pull off their 2nd life.  thats basically what it is.  nothing but living 2 lives because you cant stand the one you are stuck in, so you use to ""take off the edge"".  don't worry, nothing i am babbling about has anything to do with the movie directly.  just expressing what this movie made me feel.",1292198400,4,669,4.015151515151516
