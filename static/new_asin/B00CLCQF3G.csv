5725932,4,B00CLCQF3G,"Nine screenwriters assemble the dissociate jumbled element of this second installment in the THOR series (the first being directed by Kenneth Branagh and this one directed by Alan Taylor) and despite the presence of  a very similar cast this version depends more on spectacular CGI effects than on acting. It is a movie for lovers of comic book tales and it just bounces between firestorm and dissolution of nine realms to London and back.

The plot? This synopsis makes a little sense of it:  Thousands of years ago, a race of beings known as Dark Elves tried to send the universe into darkness by using a weapon known as the Aether. Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awaits the return of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall (Idris Elba), who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown. The other good folks on Asgard are portrayed by Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stephenson, Tadanobu Asano, and the folk down on earth are Stellan Skarsgrd, Kat Dennings, Jonathan Howard, and Chris ODowd. Oh and there is a cast a thousands of Asgardians and Dark Elves to tear up the screen. The real star is the team of CGI artists.

For THOR addicts, this is an entertaining film. For others, not so muchGrady Harp, April 18",1522627200,,2586,4.765625
5725933,5,B00CLCQF3G,Another great Thor movie,1522454400,,24,5.25
5725934,5,B00CLCQF3G,"This is the Blu-ray of Thor the dark world, It worked in a Blu-ray player and showed me all the darkest of Thor's world, starting with his spiral into drug-use (mead and Bog Myrtle  ) continuing with his short-lived attempt to overthrow his Father/Brother Odin's reign of Asgard in bloody revolution and ending with his ultimate revival by finding God again..  in the church of Sigurd.

Truly an epic tale of sadness and redemption

Seriously though if you want to watch the second in the Thor trilogy this movie is worth it, if not then don't buy it",1522368000,,550,4.581632653061225

5725944,4,B00CLCQF3G,"Not a bad step up for Thor, he and Loki for different reasons take the fight to Maliketh and the Dark Elves who are intent on returning the Universe to its dark days using the Aether.  Portman again cringey as Jane Foster, offset somewhat by Kat Denning in sadly shapeless outfits. BD picture quality very good.",1514764800,,311,4.553571428571429
5725945,1,B00CLCQF3G,"Well, I've read Thor since about the eighties, been into mythology longer than that.

This movie had nothing to do with either one of those sources. I can easily compare this movie to Batman vs Superman: that wasn't about either one of those characters either. No Thor, no Ragnarok (or any epicness that this is supposed to have ftm) nor anything remotely Asgardian at all. The darkness of the end was utterly lacking by a strained attempt to make all of this as funny as possible.

It was a Guardians of the galaxy wannabe mess of sticked-together videoclips. Tried to be funny too hard, but the chaos and utter lack of character made it tiresome. Hoping Marvel can follow up with something decent... Luke Cage and Iron fist disappointed recently as well, hoping something decent will come up soon. Marvel is on a downward spiral with something like this, which was to be expected of course with everyone jumping on the superhero rage with quantity trumping quality as a result.

Such a waste of all the potentail this might have been. Plenty of sources out there to draw from, besides that there's are quite a few good actors in the movie that could have saved it.",1514678400,,1166,4.650485436893204

5725961,5,B00CLCQF3G,"I absolutely loved this film!!  So Why Did I only give this version Three Stars???
Answer:
Because It Is NOT, I repeat NOT an Unrated version of the original film.  IT IS THE SAME THING as the Theatrical version!!!!

The Packaging is Misleading!  Beware!

A True unrated version would have additional footage restored into the film, as well as footage that the rating board that would have made this film a ""R"" , ""NC - 17"", or even a ""X"" Rating.

The Theatrical Version - ""5 Stars"", I repeat ""5 Stars"".  Not this version, Due to Misleading Packaging.  On Could Call the Unrated packaging a Out Right Lie.",1468368000,3,604,4.527777777777778
