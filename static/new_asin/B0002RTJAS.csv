8031184,5,B0002RTJAS,"Great teacher, relaxing and challenging. Nice to see average bodies in video not super skinny chicks in fashion yoga outfits and hella makeup - Sets the right tone for feeling good about yourself no matter what level you're at doing the practice.  Great for postpartum ladies like myself because there's a good amount of work with pelvic floor and tummy, but I would recommend this video for anyone.",1431993600,2,399,4.867647058823529
8031185,5,B0002RTJAS,"I really like this DVD.  I rented it from the library before I bought it.  I use this one for relaxation.  The first time I tried it I felt like I woke up from a massage when I finished the DVD.  It is slow, relaxing, and not very challenging, but that is exactly what I was looking for.  The person who leads you through the DVD is very knowledgeable.  Her voice is soothing.  I like it because I can pretty much keep my eyes closed the whole time and still follow the DVD.",1421625600,,474,4.032258064516129
8031186,4,B0002RTJAS,"This is Collete Crawford instructing you in voice over as well as doing the modified versions separately from three other women who are different ages, races & weights in a simple, empty, hardwood w/yellow painted room.
She speaks very slowly & relaxed w/a kind voice, not patronizing, but something that can put one to sleep if tired. Her choice of wording is more spiritual, not medical or aerobic style. She tells you when to inhale & exhale during yoga poses & even other times to keep in tune with your breath.
It starts with you seated & breathing, then reclining doing PC squeezes to strengthen the area. Then adds pelvic tilts, then ab crunches, oblique crunches & bridge pose.
Side lying w/top & bottom leg raised for strengthening & then straight leg stretch.
On hands/knees to cat/cow stretch, then downward dog.
Standing poses only has triangle to warrior 2 to triangle & standing wide legged stretch.
Reclined has straight leg stretching upward, outward & across.
Last is a nicely guided meditation.

This is best for people who are very out of shape, rarely, or never workout, have physical limitations or very low stamina. Also for those who are very tired that day & need something light & slow paced.",1289865600,7,1217,4.822966507177034
8031187,5,B0002RTJAS,This is an excellent DVD for women of all ages.  It is easy to follow but definitely makes a good workout.  It seems like I am not working that hard when I am doing it but then afterwards I feel my muscles and know they have had a good workout.  I team up either this DVD or a Pilates DVD with cardio work and have found that to be the best workout for me.,1178582400,4,356,3.7837837837837838
