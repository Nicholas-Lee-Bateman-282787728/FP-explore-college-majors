8034716,5,B0002Y4TVK,"This is marketed to a 'beginner' level guitar player but I don't think it is really for every one. Jorma is a national treasure with a unique approach to playing guitar. His recorded history with the Jefferson Airplane and then Hot Tuna bears out that he is a one of a kind, and a visit to his 'Fur Peace Ranch' web site shows he hasn't slowed down. I concede that the Airplane could have still been a hit band without him but some of their music is incredible because of him. I have heard recordings of him playing behind Janis Joplin and early on in the 1960's possibly before dropping a lot of acid and he was magnificent then too. Maybe the LSD opened his musical perceptions because his guitar adds texture to the airplane's songs weather it is simply a single sustained note or dazzling display of of a soaring guitar solo. All the more reason Jerry Garcia not only befriended him, but spent a lot of time following Jorma with a tape recorder to aid in figuring out how he played. Hot Tuna was originally an outlet for Jorma and Jack Casady to continue playing after the rest of the airplane had packed up and gone home. I don't know about the early years but I have seen bootlegs of Jorma and Jack that were around 4 hours long. These guys love to perform and were never in it for the money or fame. Both were guitar teachers prior to their joining the Airplane. Jack seems to combine guitar playing with bass guitar playing for a very unique style I happen to love being a bassist myself. Again, being a bass player it can be uninspiring to practice day after day playing the bass part to a song with no one else around. I know most bass players are really bad or frustrated guitar players but my story is in reverse. I love the bass and play guitar out of boredom. I don't think like a guitarist and it comes across in my playing. I do enjoy finger picking. I have a hand that doesn't finger full or barr chords very well and so I adapted a method of fingering chords with 2 or 3 fingers. When I decided to seek instructional video on playing my acoustic in a finger picking style I found this video and others by Jorma and decided to try it. It is unfortunate that the 'free 2 day shipping' was in reality a 9 day shipping time because I was very anxious to get started.
 Jorma has taught guitar for over 50 years and so he knows to explain every little detail unlike most instructional video. He even details how some chords he fingers unconventionally in order to more easily play other chords. He repeats what he is teaching before moving on and he gives instruction on finger exercises that can be done anywhere and anyplace. It is possible that since I am not set in my ways when it comes to guitar that I will absorb what is taught in time. I have plenty of time too. His choice in music is best described as 'ragtime' rather than folk or blues. If you don't like ragtime music this video isn't for you. If you aspire to play similar to Jorma or simply what to know how he plays a particular riff or song than certainly buy this dvd. If you are in a hurry for it to arrive watch who you order it from/.",1499126400,,3118,4.266891891891892

8034720,5,B0002Y4TVK,"Don't think I'd ever be able to puzzle out how he plays Hesitation Blues without the DVD. He has some really interesting ways of forming chords and transitioning from one to the next.

I plan to come back to the DVD later for more study.

For me personally, didn't care for the other two songs, but having the personal instruction on that one was worth the price to me. I've been playing the Hot Tuna version of Hesitation Blues for years, but there are a fair number of parts that are much better played using Jorma's techniques and hitting the notes he uses. The way I play West Coast Blues by Blind Blake is much closer to the original. Jorma has the chords right, but uses a very simplified version. Then again, he uses finger and thumb picks which make it not possible to play the way Blake played fingerstyle.

Jorma has a really unique way of playing that is captivating, so it's worth getting the insight of exactly how he does it.

Update:

I did come back to the DVD and study further because some of the transitions stuck in my mind and had to see exactly how he was doing them. Am now finding the style Jorma uses is transferring over into other music I play on the guitar and really improving it.

For example, the way he plays three treble notes in one motion but so you can hear the separate notes - adds volume and musical interest - just sounds a lot better. There is a G7 chord he uses that is a D7 shape moved up the fretboard and I find that chord coming into other music, sometimes followed by a C chord using the F chord shape moved up the finger board, other times followed by a D chord - sounds fantastic.

He has a unique style that I've always liked. Very cool to get the insights of exactly how he plays and now I can see that some practice with his techniques is spilling over, altering and making me a better acoustic guitar player overall. So I couldn't really ask for more.",1382572800,,1913,4.3

8034722,5,B0002Y4TVK,"Jorma Kaukonen's instructional video has been so much fun to learn from and in a fairly short amount of time, play better fingerpicking blues guitar.  Jorma's skill was in breaking down complex patterns and presenting them in smaller, simpler parts.  Also, his style of teaching is clear and well-paced. You feel like you're sitting with a friend in his living room, while this master musician patiently takes the time to teach you tunes he obviously loves (and you will too).  Great instructional video and teacher!",1125532800,4,516,5.047058823529412

Not only did I find what I was looking for, but Jorma teaches his style himself!  A must have for all guitar playing Hot Tuna fans.",1004313600,2,277,4.3076923076923075
8034724,5,B0002Y4TVK,"Step by step, comfortable style, like having an old friend teach you that song you've always wanted to learn.  I've got all three of Jorma's videos and an extra volume 1 to give to a friend.  If you want to learn how to make that right hand work work a little harder, this one's for you.  The songs included are Jorma's good stuff too. (more so on vols 2 and 3)  If you're new to fingerpicking styles, hang in there with vol 1.  It may take some work but the West Coast Blues lesson is a great start.",994809600,4,500,4.061224489795919
