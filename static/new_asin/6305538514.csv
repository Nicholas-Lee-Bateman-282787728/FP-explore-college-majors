If you are as big a GI Joe fan as I, this, and really the other box sets available, are a must have.  Get it now!",1035849600,3,253,3.5454545454545454
7892018,5,6305538514,"These videos weren't for me, but I haven't seen my husband get as excited about any birthday present before these videos.  I bought all three sets of videos for him, and he just loves them!",994896000,2,189,4.4
7892019,5,6305538514,"This is one the best G I Joe video sets of the Rhino Home video series!  this set contains G I Joe Volume 1-3! Selected episodes from Rhino Home video!  I repeat, this is not the actual volume 1-3 of G I Joe, such as the G I Joe: Mass Device or the Weather Dominator! It is six episodes from the T. V. series that Rhino Home Video selected for sale and purchase. G I Joe volume 1 is the best volume  of the set because it contains the World without End parts 1 and 2 episodes.  It's one of best written episodes of the G I Joe series.  Buy it!  It is a must have for all Children of the 1980s generation!!!",993168000,5,606,3.886178861788618
7892020,5,6305538514,"This set truly makes you feel like a kid again. The cartoons are great! Share them with your children! And what's more, it has the safety and morals tips that ended each episode. Roadblock says: ""Don't let  strangers on the phone know you're alone"", and Flint teaches:  ""Don't fall victim to peer pressure"". ""And now you know...  and knowing is half the battle"". GIJOE!",950313600,10,369,4.734375
