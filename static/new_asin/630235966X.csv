7824647,5,630235966X,"""Goes Forth"" follows the trials and tribulations of Edmund Blackadder and his pals in the trenches during the war. The first tape is great, but the second it better. All the episodes are brilliant, but the last one, ""Goodbyeee"", is truly unforgettable, and contains the most powerful anti-war statement ever made in British comedy.
""Goodbyeee"" is different right from the start. All the characters are still there; Baldrick is still filthy; George is still stupid; but somehow, almost imperceptibly, everything has changed. For the first time, we learn about the characters' backgrounds and lives; about their hopes and dreams, which seem strangely sad against the grim backdrop of the trenches. For the first time, Blackadder cracks jokes which cut too close to the quick to be truly funny - they're almost sad. And for the first time, we get a sense of the characters really being mortal and vulnerable in a  way we've never seen them before; yes, they've died before, but their deaths have been comic, things to laugh at. Here, we don't want them to die.
And the character of Blackadder has changed too. He has been toned down just a little; his still easy wit is less cutting, less biting. He has a world-weary air, and often seems as though he is a man who has been fighting for so long that he has almost forgotten what he is fighting for; he just wants to go home. The war that is raging all around him all too visibly has changed him, saddened him; forced him to grow up at last and face his responsibilites.
Throughtout the history of the Blackadders, they have all run from life; tried to escape. Here, Blackadder essentially does the same thing; he doesn't want to go over the top, doesn't want to be a part of the war - doesn't want to die. But here, for the first time, we feel that his fears are justified; we actually sympathise with him. And here, also for the first time, he finds himself unable to escape, and war finds him at last.
Blackadder has died many times before in history, but never as powerfully as here, during the final push over the top.
He has tried everything he can to escape, but now here he is at last, faced with certain death and no way out. Everything is eerily quiet as the men assemble. Silence. Last hopes are crushed; last goodbyes are said, quietly, with typical English reserve. Then the command is given, the whistle's blow - and they are over the top and running. Here the action slows down, and they run in slow-motion across  no man's land, straight into gunfire. They do not get far. The picture freezes, and is replaced by a field of poppies in the sunlight - the single most poingant, memorable image ever captured on British television. The closing theme plays, slowly, in a chilling minor key. It is over.
The impact ""Goodbyee"" has had on British watchers is immeasurable. Broadcast just days before Poppy Appeal, there is no way of measuring the affect it must have had on people, young and old. Rowan Atkinson (Blackadder himself) claims that while shooting the episode, he experienced an unreasonable sense of foreboding, as though he was really going to die at the end.
Thank God Ben Elton and Richard Curtis had the sense to end a Blackadder series based on soemthing as serious as the war on a poignant, sobre note. A stupid, comedic death would have trivialised war, which this certainly did not. Also, if Elton and Curtis had chosen to create a hero out of Blackadder, it wouldn't have worked, because if he had done something truly heroic, he would have been out-of-character and far less believeable. However, by keeping him as an essentially normal human being, with faults, and not a hero, they succeeded in capturing the spirit of the war very accurately: the majority of people who died were not heroes; they were not flawless, unselfish people - they were just men.
""Blackadder Goes  Forth"" is completely unforgettable.

7824648,5,630235966X,"Blackadder Goes Forth should not be contemplated for purchasing. It should BE LAW for you to purchase it. The first two episodes on the tape are fine, funny things with expert comic timing, killer scripts and the usual cannon of genius comedians. Then we have Goodbyyeee!
Have you ever cried when  watching a comedy?  Cried hard and long? Not likely unless you have watched  this. This even beats M*A*S*H and Dr. Strangelove  for moving comedy. The  most bitter and satirical of all Blackadder episodes Goodbyyeee! is  punishing stuff. The blind stupidity of the Generals as they send thousands  to certain death is painfully played out with the blackest of humour. The  General's cunning attack plan consists of using the same useless failed  plan used the previous eighteen times because it would be 'the last thing  the Germans would be expecting'. Comprehension slowly dawns on Baldrick and  Lt. George as they realise that they ARE going to die like the others and  that the patriotic 'give 'em cold steel!' is all a cruel sham. Most tragic  of all is the self serving Blackadder whose cunningness cannot save him  this time, no matter how many outlandish plans he puts into motion. Finally  they are assembled in their trench ready to go over. Goodbyes are exchanged  and the whistle is blown. They go over the top into a hail of bulletts and  shells. The piano plays the theme true, slowly and softly as they move in  slow motion to certain death. . . I cried. You will cry. Never Again.",957398400,,1494,4.747081712062257
