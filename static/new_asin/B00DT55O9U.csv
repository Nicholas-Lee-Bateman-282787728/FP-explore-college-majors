5853919,4,B00DT55O9U,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot) com says: Finally, a fresh kind of crazy-ass chickbabes driven film! This could be a one word review frankly: AwesomeBut, that wouldnt do director and writer Geoffrey Fletcher credit enough for delivering a real interesting couple of hours to this film enthusiast.

Story goesTwo angelic young ladies are introduced as the film starts. You know something is off with them just not quite what. They are making small talk as the meander through the streets dressed as nuns with pizzas in their arms; delivery?

Fear not, you shall see soon enough. These habit-wearing vixens are packing more than stuffed crust pies. Violet (Alexis Bledel) and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan), are professional hit men  albeit they each look about twelve - and come complete with a bubble gum popping persona. Yet, don't let the doe-eyed gaze and petite frames fool you. You'll discover faster than you can say what the fu...that this double dose of danger are really into what they are doing.

As plot would have it, their next job, called easy, turns out to be not so much so. The hit known simply as ""Him"" (James Gandolfini) has ripped off their Boss and the duo are to 86 him pronto.

The best laid plans right? Well, they  literally  fall asleep on the job, and the Him gets the upper hand on the dosing damsels. And we are off on the ride. As rivalries and since-your-so-close-to-death-may-as-well-be-honest conversations keep the film moving forward like a staple gun at a craft fair.

The characters are rich and deeply carved; they could be in that secret contacts list that only people called simply Boss have at their finger tips. And, women drive the leads making the whole film fresh and, oddly, empowering for women. You really have to see the work to get that statement ; for this reviewer to sound less pro-killer.

The whole cast and crew have dressed, spoken and set the scene for the script perfectly. The performances by Bledel and Ronan utterly superb; Bledel has that whole sociopathic/ psychopathic calmness down and twinkling in the eyes, while Ronan plays with her gal smarter-than-she-acts and possibly able to dig out of the grave-fillin' for profits racket while also, frequently, dolloping in helpings of chilling indifference. Watch out for those two gals...hopefully, they each have long careers ahead for themselves.

James Gandolfini, here a third lead, the bass to the trio if you will, expertly wields his character's state of mind. He passed on, but in this performance Gandolfini he has left us to remember how wonderfully he could walk his own wire of everyday guy. How he was a maestro of great secrets seen in the flash of a brow and undertones layered deep below a smile or smirk. He also knew a good script when he read it.

The writer director Geoffrey Fletcher has made a helluva film here. Violet & Daisy is quirky enough for indie film fans to savior and on mark for any crime genre fans outside of that big-budget cookie cutter crap. Plus, the smooth story-telling by the actors walking about in their characters could make this film a lasting new classic; a Pulp Fiction for the girls is a fair thing to say, but the film seem to beg to not to be compared, but stand proudly aside.",1384819200,,3237,4.7831541218638
5853920,5,B00DT55O9U,"As I watched this  film, I thought it might just end up a cult classic.  Alot of people get shot, mostly by the two young female assassins, there is blood but not much gore if any. No nudity, but there is a bit of bad language. The movie is not fast paced, but steady. However, when people start getting shot the pace kicks into high gear real fast. This movie never lost my attention from beginning to end. The drama created by the two assassins and their intended victim is actually quite wonderfull, considering the subject matter. I suggest you watch this one and make up your own mind. I believe you will be quite satisfied that you did. Parts of this movie tend to stick in your mind well after the end credits roll. Besides the drama there is some humor and perhaps even tears for the viewer, so prepare yourself to be entertained.",1384819200,15,838,4.4
5853921,5,B00DT55O9U,"Imagine if you will a universe where Katy Perry and Taylor Swift are paid hitmen working for Danny Trejo in another cameo role. Violet (Alexis Bledel) and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) are downright enjoyable in this quirky dark comedy. This is a genius indie designed to give you a Merrillee Rush. Violet and Daisy come across an easy hit (James Gandolfini) which causes them to examine their lives...one where they met as doll surgeons and life is about a Barbara Sunday designer dress.

Some lines from the film:

About the number one killer: ""He once killed 3 ninjas with a fingernail file.""
Violet theology: ""Heaven is a place...where everything is free or at least wholesale.""
And ""Everything is a test when you are a career woman.""

Excellent musical score using classical rock tunes to give them new meaning.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.

Written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the first African-American to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay - ""Precious.""",1384041600,13,967,4.9813664596273295
5853922,5,B00DT55O9U,"A few minutes after a startling and memorable opening sequence I started to wonder where Violet & Daisy was going.

Then, somewhere towards the end of its first third, things started to turn. The characters, the language and even the style of the piece evolved and landed the characters (and me) in a number of unexpected and poignant places. The film also stayed with me days after it ended and that was the last thing I expected to happen. Violet & Daisy packs heat but it also packs an emotional Trojan horse.

The imagery, editing and sound design are of a stylized and seamless universe. The use of symbolism (I'm still processing some of it) is something rarely seen in films these days - especially in those about hip young criminals coming of age.

I've always liked many of the actors in the cast but I never imagined that they would appear in the same film. (The ensemble is just one of the odd and intriguing elements at play here.) All of the actors delivered and did so with performances that were stark departures from their previous roles. Saoirse Ronan is funny, Alexis Bledel is psychotic and James Gandolfini is, in what might be his greatest film role of all, nothing short of sublime. Veterans like Danny Trejo and Marianne Jean-Baptiste are delightful, as are rising stars Tatiana Maslany and Cody Horn.

With Violet & Daisy, some have drawn comparisons to movies like Hanna, Kick-Ass and Sucker Punch. Those comparisons seem misplaced. Violet & Daisy reaches for something very different from those films and succeeds quite daringly.

I took a chance and was quite pleased.",1382140800,49,1595,4.785454545454545

Violet (Bledel) and Daisy (Ronan) are young girls who are best friends and assassins. When they see dresses they want they decide to take one more job in order to be able to pay for them. What is supposed to be a quick one shot one kill job becomes complicated when they start to talk to their mark. They start to become involved in his life and that changes their feelings about what they are supposed to do. There are some movie I watch based on the subject. Some I watch based off the cast. Then there are movies I watch because of one person. I have been a huge James Gandolfini since the first episode of The Sopranos. The movie on its own is pretty good and I did like it, but it's not a typical assassin movie. Do not go in expecting a shoot-em up action fest. This deals with more of a conversation between the three about why killing is the right thing to do. The assassins don't want to and the mark wants them to. Different but I liked it. Overall, not a typical assassin movie but worth seeing, especially for Gandolfini. I give it a B.",1382054400,5,1171,4.095652173913043

5853926,3,B00DT55O9U,"Violet (Alexis Bledel) and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) are a young assassin duo who makes the most of their girlish looks with every job. Daisy is more playful and curious while Violet tends to take pride in overexerting herself with her work. After deciding to take a vacation, the girls are pulled back in by not only their boss Russ (Danny Trejo) but an easy job promising to pay well and go towards some expensive new dresses. What they get in their next target is Michael (James Gandolfini), whose kindness and unbelievable sense of compassion make him one of the most unique hits Violet and Daisy have ever encountered.

""Violet & Daisy"" is a bizarre film. It's this really unusual mix of crime, action, comedy, and drama. Its overall dark tone and heartfelt center that it attempts to avoid until the final act are its highlights, but are also reminiscent of the expectations one may have had for a little crime comedy film known as ""Sugar & Spice"" all the way back in 2001. While ""Sugar & Spice"" didn't deliver much of anything memorable and fell directly on its face, ""Violet & Daisy"" glides through its 88-minute duration rather effortlessly in comparison and is short, sweet, and to the point.

What's off about ""Violet & Daisy"" is its choice of humor. There's this childlike demeanor and acts like an undertone for the entire film. Since Daisy turns 18 at the beginning of the film, it isn't exactly a foreign concept. Unfortunately it often makes certain scenes feel way more juvenile than they probably should. The constant games of patty cake and thumb wars don't really serve any purpose. The internal bleeding dance at least has a payoff. Danny Trejo being turned on by Alexis Bledel's wet willy is kind of horrifying and the veterinarian joke gag is somewhat humorous when it's first introduced, but is used one time too many once the film reaches its halfway point. However the joke about the highest ranked assassin in the game, who is said to be more of an urban myth than anything else, is pretty great.

The relationship that begins to develop between Michael and Daisy and to a lesser extent Michael and Violet is what makes the film worthwhile. To be clear, you never hear Michael give his name. That name is only being used here because that's the name James Gandolfini is given in the credits. Gandolfini's character is so good-natured that he seems to genuinely bring out these tender moments in the film between the three leads that's really extraordinary and touching. The film also seems to purposely leave the viewer a chance to ask why the characters aren't doing this or that only to turn around and address the matter minutes later; not silencing their guns and using the gun left on a corpse after running out of ammo are the best examples.

There are certain concepts in ""Violet & Daisy"" that are fantastic. They're usually little things like showering on a bathtub full of corpses or the placement of two glasses in more than one scene that you find yourself admiring. It's those one-on-one conversations that make the film touching, which results in the film being this emotional journey that none of the characters expected. That childlike behavior is a result of Daisy's innocent nature, but those moments of naivet leave you scratching your head more often than not. The chapter breaks don't really seem to add much of anything to the film either and are mostly unnecessary.

Seeing James Gandolfini portray a decent guy after playing such sleazy characters in films like ""Killing Them Softly,"" ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,"" and even ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a welcome change of pace. Nevertheless, ""Violet & Daisy"" will just make you want to revisit ""Hanna"" again once it's over. Even with all of its crafty peculiarity and poignant sentimentality, ""Violet & Daisy"" is no ""Hanna.""",1370304000,9,3819,4.824427480916031

5853958,4,B00DT55O9U,"This is the second time I've seen this movie. The first time, I hadn't yet watched Gilmore Girls, so I didn't know who Alexis Bledel was. This time I watched it specifically to see her. I've also seen a number of movies with Saoirse Ronin since I saw this the first time and enjoyed her performance here as well. Plus in the meantime I have also watched Orphan Black, so it was a nice surprise to very briefly see a young Tatiana Maslany.

As far as the story and meaning of the film, your guess is as good as mine. In the trivia it said that the director was influenced by Quentin Tarantino, something that is quite obvious considering the violence, blood, and teenage characters who apparently have no morality or conscience whatsoever. Pulp Fiction and Thelma & Louise are also listed as influences. Several people have called the Violet character ""psychotic."" She may be a psychopath, but that is not the same as psychotic. As far as Daisy goes, if she was shooting blanks or not shooting at all, my question is, why did she get into this line of work in the first place? But the film does not lend itself to such questions. They are who they are and they do what they do. I'm not a big fan of James Gandolfini but his character is very sympathetic.

All I can say is, despite the violence, which was so over-the-top it was almost meaningless, I enjoyed the film both times I watched it. I think people will either love it or hate it. If you need a story that makes sense, has a beginning, middle, and end (hopefully happily ever after), then this is not the film for you. If you like something a little experimental, a little surreal, and a lot symbolic, give it a try.",1523404800,,1674,4.396774193548387

In terms of production value, it was really well done...  acting, camera work, audio, etc...  all totally on point...

And it's certainly got some entertainment value...

But the movie / story itself seemed disjointed...  And it also lacked any ""urgency"", so there was practically no real suspense...  Coupled with the lack of suspense, there is pretty much no climax and resolution...  ( yeah, I guess there is something of a resolution, but what's the point when you never had a climax to begin with... )...  If there was any kind of ""message"" the movie was trying to convey, it certainly missed it...

Entire chapters ( the movie is divided up into whatever 10? chapters...  Tarantino-esk ) could have been omitted and it wouldn't have impacted the movie at all...  What's the point of some strange dreamy flashback chapter, when it's never explained and has absolutely no bearing on what's going on in the present?  whatever...

5854026,5,B00DT55O9U,"When was the last time you saw a movie about a couple of adorable girls who also just happen to be quite professional and competent contract killers? As an added bonus, Danny Trejo appears as their boss, who gets a wet willie from Violet, which he likes a little too much for her liking, and then plays pat-a-cake with Daisy as they discuss their latest job, a man who inexplicably WANTS to be murdered, and whom Daisy also plays pat-a-cake with while the duo figure out exactly what to do with him. The girls are more than a little perplexed by his behavior, and decide they don't really want to finish the job until they find out WHY he wants to die.

This movie is like a breath of fresh air, although it might be more than a little disturbing, if you think about it, how two such very young women can be so casual and unfazed by the many pitfalls and consequences of their chosen profession. We get some glimpses of their obvious callousness early on, and it becomes even more apparent during the ""internal bleeding dance"" scene and when Violet takes her shower (no nudity, sorry).

If you're tired of seeing the same crap rolled up in different wrappers, give this one a try. Unlike most indies, it doesn't suffer from pretentiousness or an obtrusive soundtrack of obscure music. This is quite simply a rare gem of a film that unfortunately most people have probably never heard of before.

A post Pulp Fiction crime film that feels almost more anime than Tarantino.  So many contradictions.  Brutal but sweet.  Dreamy but on point (story wise).

The fact that this film is so under the radar (even with its three leads) is kind of startling.  Its a cult film waiting to happen.  In the old days you had to remember names of movies and try not to forget because there was every likelihood that unless massively popular, a film might never appear on TV again and be lost to you.  No way to share it until VHS came along.  Im buying it just in case the modern version of that happens (the disc goes out of print).  Ill want to revisit this odd sucker.

5854054,2,B00DT55O9U,"Nope. Starts out, literally, with a bang, and you might think you're in for a surrealist violent fantasy somewhere between Tarantino and Luc Besson. Sadly, the opener is the best scene in the film, which quickly reveals that writer-director Geoffrey Fletcher ain't half the auteur he must have thought he is. No movie about two gun-toting teenage assassins has any right to be as boring as this one becomes, or as tedious, especially when they're played by Ronan and Bledel. It's not the their fault, or James Gandolfini's -- all three are troupers and do what they can with what they're given. The fault is entirely in the script, which plays like a meandering, half-baked first draft that sat in the top drawer of  Fletcher's desk until his big success with Precious suddenly gave him the opportunity to make this almost total fail.",1438473600,,834,4.8321678321678325
5854055,3,B00DT55O9U,"I had hoped to like this film more.  I think I got it, in part, because Gandolfini is in it and it was one of his last 10 films before his untimely death.

He finished his scenes in 2011 and died in June 2013.  Co-starring are Alexis Bledel [from Sin City] as Violet and Saoirse Ronan [Hanna] as a pair of young, white, somewhat nave contract killers.  The killer-with-a-heart-of-gold is hardly an un-mined lode for movie plots and I didn't feel there was much new here.  But I didn't compare this to Hanna or some other films reviewers mentioned; it felt as if I were watching a cheap knockoff of Pulp Fiction without as much depth.  What I did like: Ronans innocent, wide, clear-blue eyes.  Gandolfinis acting--I haven't seen many of his performances but in at least one scene here, he was fantastic.  It's hard to discuss this plot at all without giving too much away, but I can say that Gandolfinis character was their next contract and the story of that job is the focus of the film.  Yes, there is gunfire and quite a bit of blood, and it is all treated so casually that it might contribute to the idea that violence is no big deal.  But this is not primarily an action movie [again, like Pulp Fiction]; it's more complicated than that.  My wife did enjoy it, perhaps because it has a female pair in the lead roles.",1436832000,,1321,4.417355371900826

The central issue is that it's simply not good despite some good performances from people who are somewhat old hat at this, like Gandolfini, Ronan, and Trejo, and someone who is kinda new but only sorta, which is that girl with the travel pants sisters.

Part of the reason it's not good is that it's both surprisingly tame and surprisingly boring. It's written and directed by the guy who adapted Precious. He's clearly no prude and knows how to tweak people. None of that is on display here. The content that you'd think he'd emphasize he doesn't. In the end, you have a weirdly sanitary film with a few off putting under tones that aren't explored despite being the main draw of a clear exploitation film like this. I think part of the problem is maybe a change in taste of the writer/director. It seems as though he had something rougher and wilder that was neutered due to an uptick in Oscar level success.",1431475200,,1022,4.524324324324325

5854070,3,B00DT55O9U,"Ah, the rare discovery of the truly unmarketable film. Hence the rarity of the discovery. ""Violet & Daisy"" doesnt have a genre. I think the filmmakers couldn't make up their mind, and tried a little bit of everything. And it failed on many levels. It was interesting, but just because it was so damn weird.

Violet and Daisy are teenage assassins. Well, Daisy is, but I have no idea how old Violet is, since she had a previous partner who died at least 3 years prior to the movie, and Alexis Bledel was 30 years old when the movie was made. She doesnt really act like an adult either, so its anyones guess. Anyway, they take a job from their boss, MacheteI mean Danny Trejo, to assassinate James Gandolfini (whose character doesnt have a name in the movie) but hes the least likely guy you would expect. Then Daisy starts asking questions, and the movie turns into a touching drama, interspersed with a couple of bloody shootouts and at least one really disturbing scene (The Internal Bleeding Dance, what the hell?!?).

Its got some stylish scenes, its got quirky female leads, vintage songs playing intermittently, an interesting dream / flashback scene that doesnt really make sense, and a great performance by James Gandolfini, akin to his role in ""Welcome to The Rileys'"". Its like a crime movie co-written and produced Zooey Deschanel. This is supposed to be some sort of parody of Quentin Tarantinos workshes listed under Special Thanks in the end credits and I might have understood it better if Id seen ""Pulp Fiction"".

I paid $4 for it, and Ill probably watch it again. Maybe Ill understand it better if I re-watch it. Saoirse Ronan was in it, and that was pretty cool.

And its the only movie that youll ever see where Rory Gilmore licks her finger and sticks it in Machetes ear, right before Machete plays pat-a-cake with Hanna.",1429747200,,1840,4.687306501547988

The actors and their performances are uniformly outstanding, but the real stars of this film are the surprising young female leads Saoirse Ronan and Alexis Bledel, both playing against type.  Ronan of course is best known for her role as the lethal and vengeful teenage killer-in-training in ""Hannah"" (another terrific film) and Bledel will forever be known as the sweet and perfectly adorable Rory Gilmore of ""Gilmore Girls.""  It took a while for me to look past Bledel's mesmerizing blue eyes and stop thinking of her as ""Rory"" but in the end she pulls off a very difficult role and convinces you she is a first rate actress when given the chance.  Ronan of course is one of the best young actresses around today and deserves all the accolades she gets.  Gandolfini plays a gentle variation of his usual mafia persona while becoming the centerpiece individual around which the whole story evolves.  As another reviewer mentions, the music is outstanding, as is just about every other aspect of this movie.  The ending was not as fulfilling as I would have liked and it almost calls for a sequel to show where the two young ladies end up.

5854104,3,B00DT55O9U,"So, for some reason this movie was held up in production hell for two years.  It was originally shot and released (partially) in 2011 and yet it never saw an official US release until early 2013.  Conceptually and stylistically, I can see why this wouldnt necessarily pull in big box-office numbers, and Im sure that the passing of James Gandolfini bolstered interest in its release this year (not like they planned for that to happen, but they did release this a month after his death), but Im really surprised that it took THIS long for it to drop.

It isn't anything special, but it has its merits and should be seen.

Im a little concerned that society is becoming too obsessed with pre-teens and teens killing people.  With The Hunger Games being SO successful and all these young adult series featuring young kids taking the reins and killing and killing and doing more killing and films like Hanna and Violet & Daisy (both starring Saoirse Ronan) turning teens into assassins Im beginning to worry about the collective interests of the world.

Why is this such a thing?

Im not saying that the idea isn't something to be toyed with on occasion, and Hanna in particular was a VERY strong film, but I fail to see why its become so popular.  Lets space it out a bit.

Violet & Daisy tells the story of two teenage girls who happen to be partners in crime, killing off whoever their mysterious boss requires them too.  They are in want of a vacation, and then they see a special dress they just HAVE TO HAVE and so they accept one last job, which they assume is going to be a piece of cake.  Then they meet their hit; an older man who is not only kind hearted but who has a troubled backstory and wants desperately to die.  This confuses the two girls and even makes them sympathize and connect to him.  When they save him from a rival gang who also want him dead, their bond becomes closer and soon they start discovering things about themselves they didn't know beforehand, or didn't want to confront (or divulge).

The strengths in this film lie in the acting.  Not all of it, but some of it.  Both Saoirse Ronan and James Gandolfini are strong here and help anchor the film in places where it could have fallen short.  Gandolfini had a remarkable year, which is depressing for one very big reason.  His range was certainly exemplified in the way he handled such internalized emotion, and anyone who thinks he was only Tony Soprano needs to reevaluate that stance by watching his 2013 releases (and really, most of his film work, which is very strong).  Ronan also shows a lot of character shading here, especially in her quiet scenes with Gandolfini.  Bledel is a sore spot, mostly because she just pales in comparison to her co-stars.  She also has the biggest arc (emotionally) and she cant handle it.  While Ronan is perfect as the nave partner, I really think she should have swapped roles to make this more convincing.  Ronan is just the superior actress, and Violet is the most complex character (while Daisy is more of the star).

Conceptually, I also feel like this one didn't fully cook.  There are some themes here that needed more kneeding to feel complete.  The sad thing is that it is evident that Violet & Daisy wants to say something more than watch these girls kill people but when it all ends it feels like that is all it really said.  I think making the character of Michael (Gandolfini) the most interesting and fleshed out was a detriment, even if it offered Gandolfini a chance to really pull it out.  It took the focus away from the protagonist and made their particular story less important and ultimately less memorable.

Unlike Hanna, where all the shading and development was focused on Hanna herself (with plenty of supporting development that was never distracting), Violet & Daisy doesnt really develop Violet or Daisy as fully as it should.  Yes, there are hints (Daiseys blanks; Violets rape) but they are merely mentioned and passed over for yet another plot point.

So, in closing, the film is engaging in parts but ultimately incomplete.",1389052800,3,4078,4.6300417246175245

The story is a somewhat sad... However, I really enjoyed Gandolfini's performance. If you want to see another great film with him, then definitely check this one out! The blu-ray for Violet & Daisy looks and sounds great!",1388707200,2,482,4.738095238095238
5854112,5,B00DT55O9U,"I have to start this off saying the only reason I bought the DVD was because it starred Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls. Of course this is a completely different character than Rory Gilmore. But I have to say that not once did I ever think of Rory while watching Alexis playing Violet.

The story - Violet and Daisy are young hit women (Daisy just celebrated her 18th birthday). They take on last job so they can buy a designer dress. They arrive early at the guys apartment, and fall asleep. When they wake up he is sitting in a chair opposite them, waiting. They can't understand why he didn't take their guns. After a while it is revealed he stole money from some really bad guys and would rather a quick kill by V&D rather than being tortured then killed.

I won't spoil the rest of the movie

In spite not knowing exactly what the movie was about, I'm glad I bought it. It is entertaining, humorous, and had some sad-ish parts. And it certainly was different.",1388448000,8,963,4.398876404494382
5854113,5,B00DT55O9U,"Gandolfini is amazing; a wonderful movie to watch if you really appreciate his skills.  I wasn't a fan of Alexis Bleidel until this movie, and Saorsie Ronan is amazing as usual.  Complex yet fun, childlike yet mature, a nuanced mix of characters, themes and overall wonder.",1386892800,,273,4.913043478260869
5854114,4,B00DT55O9U,"An entertaining and wonderfully shot movie, James Gandolfini playing against type (even though the film is not a total departure from his wheelhouse), Saoirse Ronan and Alexis Bledel starring as two young, hot assasins and just enough violence thrown in - this movie has heart.",1386633600,2,277,5.177777777777778

5854116,4,B00DT55O9U,"Different and thought-provoking, beautifully filmed. Not like everything else. Saoirse Ronan is always fabulous and James Gandolfini will be missed. In fairness, the rest of my family didn't like this as much as I did, but if you want to suspend disbelief and explore something different, this is a great film.",1385769600,3,310,5.098039215686274
5854117,4,B00DT55O9U,"This movie is a very light ""dark comedy"".  It is surreal and has some fresh ideas, most of which worked for me.",1385683200,,111,4.045454545454546
5854118,5,B00DT55O9U,"I wasn't sure about this movie when I saw the trailer.  I love the actresses, but I wasn't sure if they could pull off the roles in a believable fashion.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Both gave a phenomenal performance, making the characters come to life and giving depth where none was expected.  Personally I was reminded of anime characters like the Dirty Pair and Gunsmith Cats.  I am no expert on anime, so others may disagree, but that was my experience.  Gandolfini was amazing as well.  Honestly the whole cast performed wonderfully and every character was actually likeable in their own way.  The story flows quite well and the humor feels natural despite the circumstances.  Any fan of dark comedies or of any of the primary cast should give this film a chance.  It won't change your life or anything, but it will entertain you for a couple of hours.",1385596800,,865,4.66887417218543
5854119,3,B00DT55O9U,"Geoffrey Fletcher, Oscar-winning screenwriter of Precious, writes and directs Violet & Daisy, a drama about two teenage girls Violet (Alexis Bledel) and Daisy (Saoirse Ronan). They are also contract killers for a living, taking orders (unless they are on vacation) from an unknown boss through a middleman (Danny Trejo in a cameo role).

To gets some extra money quickly, Violet and Daisy accepts a job to kill a guy named Michael (James Gandolfini), but their quick and easy plan goes awry when Michael, sitting quietly in the chair, says he will accept his fate. In fact, he is more than ready to be killed by the girls.

Violet & Daisy is not an action film. The film is certainly about killers, but except in the opening it doesnt have shoot-outs. Mostly set in an apartment, Violet & Daisy unfolds like a stage play, with characters interacting with each other through dialogue. The film is talky, but the camera is stylish, providing some nice visual touch.

No one will take the films premise of two teenage girls as contract killers too seriously, especially when they dress themselves as nuns, but the tone of Violet & Daisy (whose names might be reference to real-life conjoined twins Violet and Daisy Hilton) often moves from surreal to real (and to surreal back again). The film goes back and forth between absurd (Internal bleeding dance!) and serious, but to what purpose I don't know exactly.

Obviously Violet & Daisy attempts to do something new and different, but I don't know what it really is. But I do know that the film belongs to James Gandolfini, whose subtle performance makes his sad-eyed character credible. We miss him.",1385510400,,1647,4.850533807829182

Not a big budget film, but I don't think that a film has to have a 100 million on it to get a 5 star rating.  Sweet, silly at times, but most of all poignant.  Brought tears, which is a rare occurrence for me.  Hard to classify this film.  Quite unique, well written, and well acted.",1525564800,,438,4.08235294117647

What I have trouble with is this: there really isn't a point to the movie. There isn't any kind of beginning, middle, end. It just catches everyone up in the midst and ends a little while later. There isn't a plot per se. It is just a couple of cute girls who are hitmen and they ...well...that's it. They meet a target who is nice. Then it ends. Sorry about the non-spoiler spoiler.",1525219200,,522,4.4375
