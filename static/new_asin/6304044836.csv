795022,5,6304044836,"The first major flaw in the original is Sabrina's attempted suicide. It is unbelievable and makes her a much weaker character than in the remake. The new Sabrina would never hurt her father that way and in spite of her  obsession with David, she has a quiet inner strength that develops  throughout the film.  The pathetic presence of the father in the original  is marvelously corrected in the remake. With Linus as the paternal  figurehead and his mother as the strong matriarch of the family, the entire  atmosphere changes for the better.  David Laraby is far better cast not as  a man who can't stay married but as a good man who just needs to rise up  from under Linus' shadow. The ""new"" David has character and charm  and likability far superior than the original. The viewer likes him even  though he doesn't necessarily like what he does. The characters in the  remake are far more believable, the dialog is clever, memorable, and very  funny in many places. The romance between Linus and Sabrina develops far  more believably in the 1995 version. This Sabrina is very wise and digs  deep into Linus' soul and shows him things about himself he has never seen.  He is at first uncomfortable with that, but it ultimately does a  transformational work in him. Another serious flaw in the original is the  quickness with which Sabrina forgives the horrible things Linus has done to  her. Linus has deeply violated and hurt her.  In the remake she does not  just fall into his arms at first sight of him.  Linus must reach deep into  her heart and heal the wounds he has caused. He opens up to her in a way he  has never done to anyone and admits that she is the key to  ""saving"" him from himself. Finally totally convinced of his  sincerity and love, she falls into his arms.  Critics are right when they  say there is no comparison between the original and the remake. But far too  many of them favor the wrong movie.  The 1995 Sabrina will be a classic in  its own right.  It's excellent!  It's a shame it has not yet gotten its  much deserved credit.",921196800,23,2058,4.517711171662126
795023,3,6304044836,"Now, please don't get me wrong, the movie does have its strengths- Harrison Ford as Linus Larrabee was a delicious treat and a believable role for one of my favorite actors and Greg Kinnear as David was the coup of the  century-perfectly cast! However, my biggest regretable point is Julia  Ormond (who I immensely enjoyed in Legends of the Fall). She is, sorry, too  old not only bioliogically, but in her whole demeanor, for the part and  seems like a strange choice to play the part of an innocent and sheltered  daughter of the Larrabee's chauffer, even of the plot has been updated for  the 90's (working at French Vogue instead of attending cooking school). I  guess she was the It Girl at the time. Personally, I would have loved to  have seen Darcy Bussell, prima ballerina with the Royal Ballet in the part  of Sabrina. Or perhaps Christy Turlington. (Based on all the supermodels  popping up in every other film, I do not believe it would have been a  stretch.)Understandably, anyone in a remake of an Audrey Hepburn part would  have a tough going at it, but I could not get past that one mis-cast,  though I did overall like the film. But the title is Sabrina- not that foxy  Harrison Ford!",912470400,4,1201,4.577464788732394
795232,5,6304044836,"Any movie I watch more than once is a good movie.  Yes, Audrey Hepburn was great in the original.  And who doesn't love Bogart, but Harrison Ford was a better Linus.

This one, with the actors and actresses in it was very pleasant to watch. I am drawn to movies without violence, and are actual life happenings..........or could be. If you are looking for something to watch, that doesn't leave you all tensed up when over, like a bunch of people being shot up and murdered, then watch something pleasant, such as this. I don't think you will regret it. I will have to purchase the original, made in 1952 I believe, l to appreciate the original stars that warranted a remake.",1520899200,,669,4.491803278688525

Julia Ormand was much better than Audrey Hepburn was in the original - a better actress I believe.  Great supporting cast and beautiful film work.  Maybe it was the music, the color film, but film making and acting has come a long way since the original. A lot of the stars from the olden days always played themselves in every film.

795514,5,6304044836,"Wow, what a great movie.  Love the characters and the story.  The girl is very likeable and acts terrific.  Harrison Ford kills me with that cold hard stare and stoic mumbling voice.  He is so scary in a how he controls the girl's mind.  Both are believable, but of course this is hollywood and had that richness flaunting of 50 shades of grey (the helicopter)  What is great is the under acting in what normally would be over blown emotions.
Ford is really good at the facial expressions and Ormond is so innocent and believable.  Also, the story line is well written with slight unpredictability but not so much as to make you have to figure too much out.",1516924800,2,657,4.470588235294118

795586,4,6304044836,"There were great things expected of Julia Ormond circa 1994-95 with this film as well as ""Legends of the Fall"" in which she co-starred with Brad Pitt.  Because both films either underperformed or were met with mixed critical reaction Ormond's career kind of fizzled which is kind of a shame.  She is quite good here assaying the transformation from ugly duckling to elegant swan quite convincingly.  This is also a departure of sorts for Harrison Ford playing the uptight erect business tycoon who allows his heart to be stolen by the upstart chauffeur's daughter.  The chemistry between the two is indelible and palpable.  I also liked Greg Kinnear in his screen debut as Ford's ne'er-do-well younger brother.  Kinnear was previously best known as the host of the E! Channel's ""Talk Soup"".  ""Sabrina"" is a throwback because it is an adult film in the strictest sense of the term.  There is zero on-screen sex or nudity and I couldn't recall a single swear word.  The film derives its romanticism by the simple art of conversation.  I don't assign this film the full five star treatment because it kind of meanders before arriving at its inevitable conclusion.  I would have trimmed possibly fifteen or twenty minutes from the film's 127 minute running time to relieve the occasional tedium.  Regardless, a nice film for those lamenting the loss of honest-to-goodness love stories in this day and age.",1515628800,5,1401,4.94017094017094

First off this is a remake of the 1954 Sabrina. As with all remakes when you compare them nothing is as good. I usually have the same attitude with a few exceptions. In this case I would not attempt to compare as it is not a period piece and there is no correlation other than names and general circumstances.

That being said this is a fun movie. Even though it is anticipatable and predictable the execution is superb. The dialog matches the characters and makes you feel that you are part of the movie. They did go a little overboard trying to frump up Julia Ormond for the early scenes, however she did clean up nicely.",1503100800,,883,4.378048780487805

795652,5,6304044836,"This is a film that I've seen several times. I loved the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart.  This is a remake over forty years later.  My son is a great fan of John Williams who did the music with Sting.  It is a wonderful remake of a sweet story of a young girl who is the daughter of the chauffer who grows up just outside a very rich family circle.  She is sent away because she has a crush on the younger son and she comes home beautiful and sophisticated.

I love the performance of Julia Ormond as well as Harrison Ford.  I also enjoyed the interaction of Greg Kinnear and Nancy Marchand as well as Richard Crenna, Angie Dickenson, John Wood and Lauren Holly.

Of course, the unthinkable happens and the younger son falls for her.  The older brother, a man much older than the innocent Sabrina steps in to intervene.  They spend some time together and he falls for her innocence and charm.

It is a simple romance film that holds no surprises.  It is fun to watch the story unfold and the characters  The film is often line for line from the original movie and the ending is sweet and predictable.  It is one of the reasons I enjoy it.  It is an easy watch.",1501977600,7,1186,4.3076923076923075

Anyway not sure if something did not translate in this film from original but i could not understand why she was so hung up on a jerk who never even looked her way til she got a hair cut. Of course Harrison Ford is always sexy to me so I had no idea why she would want the ugly playboy lazy jerk.
At the end the jerk dimps her for the girl with money of course and Harrison runs after her. Why I have no idea the most sickening part is her dad says you don't deserve her. In reality she is a childish jerk herself and she doesnt deserve him.",1492992000,,624,4.0

795737,4,6304044836,"Good movie. In quite a few cases, word for word from the original (1954) Sabrina, a beloved classic, and most of the story line was the same (yet if you're familiar with the story, also quite a few changes to bring it into modern times and give it its unique flavor. I can imagine it was hard for Julia Ormond to have to take on Audrey Hepburn's role (the incomparable Audrey Hepburn) and maybe that was true for Harrison Ford also, (as in, who could ever replace Bogie?) and maybe even a bit the same for Greg Kinnear having to fill William Holden's shoes. But after some initial adjustment to particularly Audrey Hepburn's immaculate characterization of Sabrina being portrayed by someone (anyone) else, I relaxed into the story just for what it is and enjoyed it. Julia Ormond was very beautiful, unique and charming, but she was a bit understated for me, she didn't have the sparkle vocally to express and touch our emotions the way Audrey did. But then slowly I got used to it just being her character in this movie and it flowed more smoothly from then on. Somehow from the beginning I was fine with Harrison Ford in his role. Even if he was Bogie's age in this (?) the fit in the ages of Julia and Harrison just seemed more realistic than Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. I found the scenery and sets to be beautiful, enjoyed the Paris scenes and ambiance and that of the Mansion, especially the outdoor solarium.

795742,5,6304044836,"It is a lovely film. Great acting all around. A real Cinderella story that all girls dream of, finding true love. This movie is a little less special, now that I've actually been to Paris, but if you don't know how nasty the people are and how dirty the streets are, you can still fall into the subtle romance of the movie. The scenes are well done. There is care taken to show, not tell, why Sabrina and Linus would be attracted to each other. It is not simply culture, but also a straightforward way of looking at the world. It is a story about two individuals finding themselves, as well as smart enough to become vulnerable to each other.",1489968000,,642,4.358333333333333

795776,3,6304044836,"This is a handsome film.  The problem is that the film's main character is decidedly hallow and empty.  Sabrina comes back from Paris with all the depth and sophistication of a student returning home from a year abroad. References to ""when I was in Paris' are really silly. Sabrina comes off as a pleasant, polite, but just a kid repeating some stuff she heard.  It is hard to believe that a guy such as Linus would be impressed.

 The character of Sabrina in this film is in need of some updating. There is no reason in a fairy tale that Cinderella cannot be sophisticated, accomplished and urbane.  Yeah, she can rekindle the school girl crush with David when home visiting dad, but the grown up Sabrina can be attracted to and attract someone like Linus.",1489363200,,757,4.57037037037037

795778,5,6304044836,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  I kept thinking how this actress, Julia Ormond, reminded me of Audrey Hepburn, and later I learned that Audrey Hepburn had starred in an earlier version that I had not seen of this same movie.  However, this Julia Ormond is really one of the most beautiful actresses I've seen in a long time, perhaps since Audrey Hepburn in the movie Roman Holiday.  Everybody else acted well also, especially Lauren Holly in a very minor role, (she looked beautiful also), but at the end I do think Julia's character, Sabrina, deserved someone better than Linus, or Harrison Ford.  My opinion though, and I'm glad I watched this movie.  It is a good movie!",1489017600,,674,4.677966101694915

795782,2,6304044836,"This thing drags its way through two hours of slooooow-motion humorless dialogue and an almost machine-like delivery of an unending miasma of uninspired lines.  If you've seen the original sparkling, humorous Hepburn/Bogart version, this endless tapeworm of a melodrama has all the panache of a flat tire.  Harrison Ford mechanically recites his text, and Julia Ormond sort of convinces as the immature tomboy at the beginning of the movie, but not as the sophisticated Parisienne she is supposed to be later on.  David Kinnear comes across as a lifeless, pasty shadow of the original David as played by the debonair William Holden.  Bogart expresses more with one glance as the 1954 Linus than Harrison Ford does during the entire movie.  It's a sad state of affairs in the Larrabee household, when the only one with a hint of emotion is the kitchen maid Rosa, played by Miriam Colon.  Two stars for scenery and sets, and that's about it for this yawner.  Before you commit yourself to two depressing hours of utter boredom, check out the 1954 original, and save yourself the reaffirmation, if any is needed, that remakes typically don't live up to the standard set by the original.",1488672000,3,1183,4.914572864321608
795783,5,6304044836,"One of the best remakes of a golden classic by the same name. Well worth watching no matter as a romantic evening or a night alone with a glass of wine and warm blanket. This is one of my all time favorite romances - right along with You've Got Mail, The Shop Around the Corner, Pride and Prejudice (with Mathew Macfadyen), Under the Tuscan Sun, and Lost in Austen, and People Will Talk. I highly recommend this movie, and the soundtrack. It is one of the most romantic soundtracks ever.",1488585600,5,487,4.4222222222222225
795784,3,6304044836,"From the stand point of storytelling, they did a great job. For the story's plot itself, it seems to be a 4 to 5 day binge for wealthy men and a starry-eyed college student. My opinion is that this plot is interesting as the intersection of these two groups are seldom seen in movies/stories that I come across. Is it worth seeing again? Perhaps if you have that much free time/ someone who gets into sharing with people stories about consumeristic tendencies and/or money buying happiness.",1488585600,,490,4.709302325581396

795877,4,6304044836,"I had seen the original version of this film with Audrey Hepburn and after watching this newer version, I must say, I was pleased seeing Julia Ormond doing justice to the plot just as well as Audrey Hepburn did. The plot is similar to the original version in that the two wealthy brothers vie for the love of their choffeur's daughter. There are some funny scenes in the movie but the main theme of the movie is romantic with some interesting underlying subplots involving character's struggles in carrying out their daily lives. I thought the acting by Julia Ormond deserved 4.5 stars with 3.5 stars for Harrison Ford and 3 for the rest of the lead characters. Overall, the plot was quite interesting and kept me glued to the screen to the end, even though I knew how it would end. It is a family-oriented movie and fun to watch, with neither sex nor violence, so I recommend it to all ages older than 12.",1486857600,6,906,4.496969696969697

Sabrina's dad and the supporting cast of maids and other household staff were funny and made a nice ensemble.

796215,5,6304044836,"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out -- and it has held up over time!  The original version with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn was so heart warming as you see Boggie become so smitten.  Harrison Ford gives you the same feeling as he starts to fall for the chauffer's daughter (Julia Ormond) while simply trying to keep her occupied after she returns from her internship in Paris.  It's hard to tell which is more touching Ford's character noticing her or Ormond's character realizing that she'd fallen for the wrong brother as a young girl....

796388,2,6304044836,"I love Julia Ormond, Greg Kinear, and Harrison Ford, I knew I would at least like the movie.  Loved the characters of Linus and his younger brother David, and Sabrina turns into such a lovely woman after her father sends her away, far away, but although totally lovely, I did find it a bit hard to watch this childlike and childish woman played out in this endearing movie.  Had that have been my child, I would have sent her to psychiatric care years before sending her to Paris in an attempt to get her the heck out of the tree, stop her peeping tom tendencies with David and his many women lovers, in an attempt to bring her out of her fantasy world and into a more real existence.  I find it hard to believe that a woman like her would have been able to form any kind of mature relationships with others her age, as she was clearly not in touch with reality at all.  How many times did her father have to tell this grown girl to get out of the tree???  So, I had to view the movie as somewhat comedic, as clearly a sophisticated billionaire like Linus would not have had a thing in common in the real world with such a childlike woman as this, and in doing so, was able to watch it all the way through, and find some enjoyment in it, for Harrison has always been one of my favorite actors, so can't be all bad.  Overall, the movie is cute, silly, story a bit ridiculous, but did not totally turn me off, and would recommend for those who love a sugar coated fairy tale type movie.",1473552000,2,1484,4.189473684210526

Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond were ideally cast, and even Greg Kinnear did a fine job in a role that I've never really liked. I'm grateful to have reached a point in my life where I can fully admit that the 1950s version of Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden was imperfectly cast, all except for Audrey who is ideal in everything. But this newer version trumps the classic version in every way, and I love classic movies. What does that say?",1459036800,2,522,4.5638297872340425

796748,5,6304044836,"Very sweet remake of the 1954 adaptation starring Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, William Holden; this one being more believable than the 1954 version as the age difference between Hepburn & Bogart was extreme.  Julia Ormond gave a perfect performance as Sabrina (the chauffeur's daughter), going from the tomboyish girl (and rather ugly duckling) in love with David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear), the flamboyant younger brother transforming to a beautiful, confident woman.  Upon her return from Paris, never being noticed by the younger Larrabee before, he is swept away (though engaged to Elizabeth Tyson - Lauren Holly) which rattles the cage of older brother Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford), the billionaire brother who is fastidiously working to merge with Tyson Electronics.  Linus sets out to end the dalliance between David and Sabrina, the measures of which are very funny in some cases (champagne flutes) and very underhanded in others.  It is a wonderful movie and definitely worth watching.",1458432000,4,997,5.412903225806452

796925,5,6304044836,"I'm a big fan of Sabrina.  I enjoyed the comical element of the film.  Harrison Ford's (Linus) interaction with prospective clients for the flat panel TV, inviting them to hit it with a hammer, bowing as he presents the hammer to the Japanese clients.  Linus pulling out a gun and shooting the screen as he argues with his brother about a girl and his brother, David, asking if this was a new way of changing the subject.

I love that the dialogue is holistic and well thought out, not gratuitous, throw away stuff.  You will see the dialogue tied up nicely as the film unfolds.

In the original film, Audrey Hepburn's Sabrina becomes sophisticated by a wardrobe change.  Julie Ormond leaves the awkward child behind and becomes sophisticated in style, manner and maturity.  Julie Ormond is a good actress, watch her revert to Sabrina the child as David invites her to a Larabee party.

This film should have been a block buster at the box office.  I predict it will continue to grow an audience befitting a true classic.",1452124800,6,1021,4.653631284916201

796980,3,6304044836,"Released in 1995, ""Sabrina"" stars Julia Ormond as an ugly duckling daughter of a chauffeur for a rich Long Island family. After blossoming in Paris for two years, she returns wherein the handsome playboy of the family finally takes notice (Greg Kinnear), but so does the all-business-minded son (Harrison Ford), which creates havoc. Nancy Marchand, John Wood, Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson and Lauren Holly have support roles.

The first 50-55 minutes are compelling and amusing drama, but when the story takes a surprising turn in the second act it bogs down with slow-moving and uninteresting romancing. Despite this, theres certainly enough good to glean here to make it worthwhile. Romance-lovers will obviously find more to cherish.

The film runs 127 minutes and was shot at Salutation House, West Island, Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, and Manhattan, as well as Marthas Vineyard.

797068,4,6304044836,"Any director who remakes a classic invites the ire of those who loved the original.  That is what happened to this version of Sabrina.  The critics panned it, and it did not do well at the box office.  However, it has since found a devoted home audience via DVD.
 Both the Billy Wilder original and the Sydney Pollack remake are enjoyable movies, but both suffer from a plot that is unbelievable, as fairy tales tend to be.  But while Sabrina is the ugly duckling who becomes a swan, the title character, she is merely a catalyst, the woman who saves Linus from his loveless devotion to business.
 This poses a casting problem for the director.  The actress must play Sabrina as young and naive, but not so innocent and vulnerable as to make the elder son, Linus Larrabee, look like a predator.  Meanwhile, Linus must seduce Sabrina away from his handsome younger brother, David (a despicable, Machiavellian task), while being sympathetic and falling in love with her himself.  Thats a tough line to walk.  Ford does it well.
 In the original, Audrey Hepburn is perfectly cast, but Bogart is far too weathered to be a credible love interest; he looks and acts like her father.  Both were superb actors, but they failed to make the romance believable.  There is no on-screen chemistry between them.  In the remake, Harrison Ford is a credible love interest and capable actor, but Julia Ormond, though she tries gamely, is miscast as the girl with enough charm to induce a hardened tycoon (Linus) to kiss off a billion dollar deal.  The closing sequence, in which Linus comes to realize his love for Sabrina and Sabrina is obliged to forgive his cruel machinations, simply does not work, in part because Ormond lacks Hepburns charm and in part because the deft comedic touch of the director is suppressed for the sake of Hollywood romance.  The ending is pure schmaltz.
 As directors, Billy Wilder and Sidney Pollack are as good as it gets.  But it is very difficult to make this story believable without a touch of magic between the leads.  Neither cast was quite able to pull it off.  The fun of both films is in the romantic complications and witty dialogue up to the final transition and that last, implausible denouement.",1447718400,,2224,4.7272727272727275

To be sure, it is a contrived Hollywood plot, but the action makes the length of the film acceptable.  Makes the typical Hollywood productions now, pale in comparison, even with their special effects, vampires, and zombies.  Guess age and viewing of many films makes one see Hollywood from a different vantage point than the current crop of critics/reviewers/viewers--makes me a skeptic or is it a realist.",1417651200,2,556,4.956989247311828

Harrison Ford plays the classic Romeo,tough but romantic, and keeps one guessing until the end.

798666,5,6304044836,"This poignant film starring Harrison Ford as the oldest son of a late billionaire businessman who by right of the first born, inherited corporate wealth and responsibility which he took to heart  a little to, seriously. His ruthless ambition was to do one thing and one thing only. That being, to get richer at any cost by using, abusing his power, lying, setting-up, tearing down, deliberately misrepresenting anyone and anything that gets in his way of solidifying billions of dollars more, in corporate deals. Even if it's his very own younger brother David and the innocent, unsuspecting daughter of his long-time, trusted, chauffer. The unscrupulous wealthy. The pompous powerful. The arrogant aristocrats and the audacious affluent. They have money, titles, power and positions. Lawyers, judges and even some legislators are in their pockets. They say and do what they want and they come and go as they please answering to know one because their enormous wealth and influence, buys and pays everybody, off. Anyone that is weak in character and can be bought off, that is. Enter Sabrina. The 'mere' chauffer's daughter who was the supposed underling, who was not educated or classy enough for billionaire David, the second son. Whose primary responsibility seemed to be to enjoy life and let his big brother do all of the corporate wheeling and dealing. But, then he falls for Sabrina. David's haughty, socialite mother takes note and informs big brother. Big, ruthless, cold, calculating, brother intervenes so that his billionaire, playboy little brother, doesn't shame the family, the family name or the entire corporation, by actually getting romantically involved with the low-class, in comparison to them, impoverished Sabrina. The blue-collar, chauffer's daughter. After all, what would people think if they saw the two of them together? Corporate billionaires have an image to uphold. They can't allow themselves to be seen romancing the butler or the maid and actually care for them as prospective marital partners, can they? Image is everything because human feelings can be stomped on or if needed, used, possibly abused but in the end, definitely dismissed and discarded. So, little brother David therefore, is immediately pressured to ditch Sabrina and initiate public image damage control and repair, by becoming engaged to another corporate billionaires  daughter. So, as to kill to birds with one stone in that, he dumps Sabrina and by becoming engaged to the corporate daughter, he also helps his big brother 'seal the deal' on a corporate merger between the two of them. Never mind who loves who. It's all about money. Right? Sabrina is given a ticket to leave the country and big brother playing the master chess game of micro-managing peoples lives, livelihoods, manipulating their preferred choices and controlling them by way of calculated deceit, thinks that he actually pulled it off. Until he met and talked with Sabrina, himself. What happened? Well, they say that 'pride comes before the fall' and that 'the harder they come, the harder they fall!' So, if you want to know what happens, watch this DVD because I think you'll be very pleased with the results. Nina Kish",1409356800,,3200,5.163776493256262

798961,5,6304044836,"I came across this movie one night as I was flipping through the channels. It was the scene where Linus comes to tell Sabrina that David can't make it because he sat on champagne glasses. I was instantly hooked. This movie is better than the 1954 original (I still recommend watching it) because of the more realistic and romantic relationship between Linus and Sabrina. While I love Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart as much as the next person and aspire to see every film they ever made, the chemistry just wasn't completely satisfying. Harrison Ford does a great job of portraying a cold, empty businessman who doesn't realize what he's missing. Julia Ormond's take on Sabrina was noteworthy too, acting perfectly as a girl who is now grown up and has to keep reminding herself she's not the awkward, unattractive person she used to be. This movie is one of my all time favorites and it encouraged my dream to go to Paris (which was achieved twice). I love the music in this film and the score done by the brilliant John Williams. Since watching Sabrina one of my favorite songs is la vie en rose which is the perfect song to express the theme of the movie and it's enchantment. I'd recommend it to everyone to watch this film because of its witty and fairytale like nature. Sabrina captured my heart almost to the point of depression that it can't be me in the film (and the Larrabee mansion). I also now have the strange desire to have a solarium in my house like the one in the movie. My point: sit back, relax, and enjoy the escape of this wonderful film.",1404777600,2,1563,4.5265017667844525

799135,5,6304044836,"If you haven't seen the 1954 movie this is a remake of, here's the basic story:  There are two brothers in the wealthy Larrabee family, one of whom is a playboy and the other of whom is a workaholic businessman.  The chauffeur's daughter, Sabrina, goes to Paris to learn a trade and comes back looking much more elegant.  The playboy is engaged to a woman from a wealthy family, which is supposed to strengthen the success of a business merger.  When Sabrina comes back from Paris, the playboy sets his desire on her, and so the businessman brother intervenes so the merger will not be ruined.  Eventually the businessman's heart softens and he stops being selfishly manipulative, and his own change causes the playboy to rise to the occasion and make things right.  It's all done with great flair and humor.

I personally enjoy this version more than the 1954 original because Harrison Ford's character has more depth than Humphrey Bogart's.  Harrison Ford and Bogart both have deadpan humor which is funny in different ways, but the way Harrison Ford's character is written is more believable, as this version spends more time on the development of his relationship with Sabrina and his inner transformation.  I really like the writing for this 1995 remake.  It is filled with ambiguity between Ford's character and Sabrina about where their relationship is at, and both Ford's character and we the audience often don't know to what extent Ford is being manipulative and to what extent he's falling in love.  The conversations they have as their relationship develops are very well written.  I enjoy each way this remake movie changes things from the original, and I feel like the flavor is a little more realistic and a little less farcical than the original, which is part of why I prefer it over the original.  Mainly I love Harrison Ford as a leading man in a romantic comedy where he doesn't have to do action stuff.  He has a depth and sincerity, and the necessary deadpan humor, which are needed for this kind of part.  Someone with a more externalized charisma like Clark Gable or George Clooney couldn't do that kind of role, but Harrison Ford can, and I consider him one of my favorite present-day actors.",1399334400,10,2217,4.782152230971128
799136,5,6304044836,Love this movie. Perfect mix of 90s style with a classic plot. All of the actors do a stellar job!,1399248000,,98,3.95
799137,5,6304044836,"I loved the older version of this film----the one with the great Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden, but I'd have to say that I really enjoy this one much more.  I went to a movie theater to see this one when it first came out and laughed out loud.  Sydney Pollack is one of my favorite directors of all time (and he was an amazing actor, as well). Julia Ormond was so stunning----I couldn't take my eyes off her gorgeous face with that lovely sunshine smile.  She looked ravishing in the green gown she wore for the party.  Greg Kinnear, in his first movie role, was so fresh and delightful, playing the wishy-washy, sometimes really goofy, David Larrabee.  Harrison Ford...... well what can be said of Harrison Ford that hasn't been said a thousand times over?  He plays Linus as a droll, sharp, and almost jaded business man.....until he finds himself drowning in love for Sabrina. I have always loved Nancy Marchand---such a great actress in drama or comedy.  I almost died from laughter when, at the party she verbally dresses down both her sons. Standing there, in that ridiculous pink evening gown with the gi-normous BOW, she so seriously asks the angry question, ""Do I look stupid?""  I was on the floor with laughter!!  Another extremely funny actress is Dana Ivey, who can spit out lines with biting sarcasm like no other. She was a scream in this one, playing Linus's secretary, Mack. Ms. Ivey's character seemed to have a better grip on the reality of the foibles of this dysfunctional family without a hint of anything but love for them.  Mack had some of the best lines in the movie.  Add to the cast Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson, and Lauren Holly and you've got yourself a fun evening!!  The 1954 version was very cool and breezy.  This 1995 version seems like a completely different, more down to earth story.",1398729600,2,1845,4.674922600619195

It's a remake of an old classic about a young girl, Sabrina, that loves a philandering rich boy played by Greg Kinnear. His stern older brother, played by Harrison Ford, is always cleaning up his messes. Sabrina lives with her father in the brothers' carriage house where he is their driver. Without going further into the story, she returns from college and things gets interesting.

While Harrison Ford always delivers solid performances, Greg Kinnear delivers a stellar performance as an overgrown brat.

I purchased this film with little expectations of enjoyment, as I am ever so delighted with the first Sabrina file, starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden.  I always found Humphrey Bogart's acting in the first Sabrina movie to be really rather wooden, excepting his a Audrey Hepburn's last scene.  But I am and always will be an Audrey Hepburn fan, and she was sensational as Sabrina.

But this in this newer version of Sabrina, the actors one and all portray their characters so wonderfully well!  I will say here, that Harrison Ford gives a much improved performance of Linus (and by a far measure more,) than Humphrey Bogart does.  The script is improved and modernized.  I think most hopelessly romantic people such as I am will enjoy owning this movie.

799729,5,6304044836,"**Spoilers below**

I've always liked this movie, and repeated watchings only make me like it more. I like it so much that even though I already own it on DVD, I plan to purchase it for my Kindle Fire so I can watch it whenever/wherever I want. It's my second favorite romantic comedy of all time. (I guess I should disclaim here that I hated the original ""Sabrina"" pretty much from the outset. I couldn't find the humor in watching Sabrina try to kill herself and Bogey just seemed unsympathetic throughout. Worse, I watched it after I saw this one and by that time I was already pretty much in love with Ford's Linus so Bogey didn't stand a chance.)

This movie is very well put together - lots of comedy, including plenty of perfectly delivered one-liners from Ford, and beautifully realistic romance scenes. The story scrutinizes both of the main characters in equal measure as Sabrina rethinks her assumptions about Linus and Linus sheds a lifetime's worth of emotional armor. Julia Ormond does a great job with a character that's often tough to sympathize with, naive and superficial as Sabrina can sometimes be. To Ormond's credit, Sabrina's romantic revelation sheds an entirely new light on the character (making Linus's ensuing confession all the more brutal).

To my mind, though, the movie belongs to Harrison Ford. I had no idea the actor who played Han and Indy (!) could imbue Linus with such subtle, varied emotions. With only a look or vocal inflection, Ford telegraphs Linus's entire unspoken backstory along with the feelings he's locked away from the world for decades. Sure, Linus shouldn't have kissed Sabrina in the solarium - but boy, does Ford make us understand why he did it: not only was Linus attracted to Sabrina, he wanted, for once, to be the guy who gets the girl instead of the hard-charging, workaholic dealmaker. The quiet anger Ford shows during Linus's talk with his mother in the office makes us feel how hard it's been for him to be the bad guy over the years - and how much he resents what it will cost him this time. Ford perfectly captures a man who, after years of accurately reading everyone else's emotions, is forced into an emotional crossroads of his own. By the end of the movie it's easy to root for the world's only living heart donor to step outside his purgatory and discover what he never thought possible. Ford's Linus is such an interesting, attractive, intelligent, perceptive, complex character that I found myself reproaching Sabrina for ever wasting one minute of her time on silly, boring David.

A few more highlights and I'll have done:

- The way Linus says ""hello"" when Sabrina drops off the pictures. His eyes light up and his voice softens, as though in that brief moment he couldn't hide his newfound feelings if he wanted to.

- The looks he and Sabrina exchange right after he asks her ""What will you tell him?"" Her eyes beg Linus to understand what she can't say aloud. His answering look acknowledges her feelings and confesses his own - with no small degree of sadness that his plan has worked so well. It's a heartwrenching combination of desire and despair as Linus recognizes the next moment will bring him exactly what he's been wanting - and the moment after that will force him to throw it all away.

- Linus's look of utter devastation after he makes his initial confession, his whole body sagging under the weight of it. He doesn't just tell the truth, he drags every last bit of his ugliness into the light so Sabrina can start hating him - and thereby getting over him - as soon as possible. To him, penance is as serious as any business deal he's ever done.

After all, the original Sabrina has been one of my favorites since my early teens (over 40 years ago). When I finally did see it, I enjoyed it because it was pretty much an entirely different story. The original story line was nicely updated to modern times when the age difference of 20s to 40s isn't as drastic as it was back when the original was made. Also, the heroine has a career (photography) in the modern version, unlike being daughter of 'the Help' with no expectations other than becoming the 'Help' herself and marrying another member of the Help. Even the playboy brother isn't as much a stereotype. I like the change of useless debutante fiancee' of the brother into a career woman in the updated version. This is a nice movie. It doesn't have the romance of the original and will never replace the original in the minds and hearts of lovers of the original Sabrina but it is a worthy movie in it's own right and shouldn't be compared to the incomparable movie that the original is.

The key is viewing it as an entirely new movie - don't compare or you'll drive yourself crazy.  I loved the woman who played Sabrina - truly magical and real.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of Humphrey Bogart; Harrison Ford was a much more relate-able and believable Linus.  I didn't really like the little side plots: (Spoiler alert ahead)  Sabrina's ends up proposing to the housekeeper and revealing he has acquired a couple million dollars.

If you are looking for a fun movie to sit down and enjoy Sabrina is an excellent choice. This is a great film for everyone in the family!  I have 4 boys in my house and they loved it just as much as my mother and I.  This is not ""just one more romantic comedy"".  It is full of plenty of one liners that keep you falling more in love with each and every character.  This story (originally written as a stage play) will captivate you in every way.  Watch it, and I'm sure like me, you will find characters similar to the people in your own life.
Harrison Ford's performance is so natural.  He, along with his costars draw you right in from the first line on.  If you have not seen it - don't wait a minute more.  Sabrina is clean, funny, and romantic.  You will not be disappointed!

The Plot:
Sabrina, a young chauffeurs daughter, spends her days swooning over the youngest son in the family her father drives for.  In an attempt to enrich her life, her father sends her away to Paris where she ultimately grows up, finds herself, and discovers life outside her crush on David.  Meanwhile back home, David has become engaged.  His eldest brother Linus is thrilled, seeing a multi billion dollar merger opportunity with David's soon to be father-in-law.
Upon her return, her childhood fantasies unfold, as David starts to pursue her (his sudden interest may or may not have a lot to do with her new makeover).  Linus quickly takes it into his own hands to see that David does not mess up the merger.  Linus creates a plan to secretly woo Sabrina away from his brother, make David's paranoid future in-laws content, then abandon Sabrina after the merger is complete.

Delivery:
As far as delivery goes, I got the movie in 2 days.  This may very depending on where you live.",1356739200,2,1778,4.455108359133127

Julia Ormond was so miscast that it was pathetic.  In her one scene when she has just arrived from Paris and is supposed to be so stunning, she simply ISN'T.  What was so bad was that they show her all the time she is in Paris looking terrible then we are supposed to believe that the day before she left Paris she got a makeover. Ridiculous. I guess nobody could have stood the comparison with Audrey Hepburn but she wasn't even in the ballpark. Harrison Ford did the best he could but he was just terribly miscast. Sometimes I've wondered - does he really think that heavy breathing through his nose is acting?

800496,5,6304044836,"I remember watching the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn and loving it, so when this newer version was on the TV, I watched it and loved it as well. Unlike some, who either liked the older or the newer version of it, I'd have to say that I liked both equally. Yes, they each have their own negative/positive moments (ie: the comment where Hepburn's ""grown up"" Sabrina was more childish acting, whereas Ormond's was more adult-like and sophisticated) I do have to agree with. HOWEVER, it is the storyline itself that captured my interest from the start, and I belive that both actresses played the role convincingly.

Possible SPOILER alert:
In my own opinion, Sabrina doesn't entirely ""grow up"" after she leaves for Paris, since one of the reasons for her going is to get away from David, the womanizing younger brother of the millionaire family her father chauffeurs. As a child/teenager, she is (pretty much) obsessed with him, while he doesn't even see her as anything but the chauffeur's daughter. But when she is in Paris, she cant seem to forget him, while he is now finally planning to settle down and marry. When she returns home, she is a very beautiful woman, with the touch of Paris elegance, and yet she is clearly not over David. He has now noticed her as a woman and is paying her the attention she's always wanted him to.

David's older brother, Linus, always looking out for the family business and money, is none too pleased with the attention David is now showing Sabrina, because David's fiancee is the daughter of their biggest business client, and one mis-step could put a halt to the contract. Therefore, Linus decides to step in and distract Sabrina from David before things go too far and ruin the merger. Long story short, they both unintentionally fall in love with each other. I think after spending time with Linus, and actually BEING in love rather than infatuated, NOW she is grown up. Which things matter more than just a silly girlhood crush. Only, Linus has always had the business-side at the forefront, and knows he may have to break her heart. Ah, the decisions he must face! What's more important, Money or love? Which does he choose?

800566,2,6304044836,"Unfortunately, I have come to this movie only after seeing (several times) Billy Wilder's classic version from 1955, starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. In comparison, Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear, respectively, pale almost painfully. Julia is stilted and lifeless from the beginning to the end, having nowhere near the charm, grace and poise of Audrey; Harrison looks clumsy and awkward in both his serious and his comic scenes, and he - despite all my affection for him - is simply not in the same class as Boggie; and Greg may be said to be the greatest disappointment, as he cannot hold a candle to the vastly underrated William Holden.

Nor do the changes in the script fare any better. The uproariously hillarious Larrabee father from the original movie is here completely omitted, while the role of the mother is unnecessarily expanded. Sabrina's Paris romance is as dull as anything and so are a number of other scenes, either lost in excessive sentimentality or artificially over/underacted. The scenes common to both movies are embarrassingly inferior in the remake. The latter, on the whole, attempts to be more serious than the original, but it only becomes a great deal less entertaining. Just compare the voice in the beginning that describes the Larrabee family and mansion: both the text and delivery are WAY superior in ""Sabrina"" (1955).

I guess without the dubious benefit of comparison, the movie is not that bad, but it wouldn't get more than three stars even in this hypothetical case. If you have never seen the original version, I suppose this may be a fairly enjoyable way to spend two hours, although many scenes leave a good deal to be desired. But if you have seen Billy Wilder's gem, better be prepared that the remake, though basically the same story, is a different affair altogether. But if you haven't, unless you have some inherent dislike to old movies, I suggest you give Audrey, Boggie and William Holden a try. For my part, I wonder why Sidney Pollack and co. wanted to make this remake in the first place. They could hardly have won against such a rival and, for my part, I repeat, they lost rather badly.",1315526400,8,2185,4.855227882037534

800659,4,6304044836,"It takes an exceptionally brave director and actress to tackle a remake of one of Audrey Hepburn's most iconic roles as the title character in director Billy Wilder's 1954 film classic ""Sabrina"".  Although veteran director Sydney Pollock and neophyte actress Julia Ormond don't exactly cover themselves with glory, nonetheless they acquit themselves well with honor.

The story begins on the Larrabee estate on the former Gold Coast of Long Island, NY.  Sabrina Fairchild, (Julia Ormond), is the very young, sheltered daughter of Fairchild (John Wood), the Larrabee family chauffeur.  The Larrabees are billionaires, with the family matriarch Maude Larrabee (Nancy Marchand), and the elder son Linus (Harrison Ford) focused on doubling the family fortune through their vast business empire, and younger son David (Greg Kinnear), a happy- go- lucky playboy intent on spending it.  Since childhood Sabrina has had a crush on David, but since she is shy and colorless, David never notices her.  On an apprenticeship to a chic fashion magazine in Paris, Sabrina finds herself and blossoms, returning home a lovely, self-assured young woman.  Her very first day back she catches David's eye, and dazzles him, quite the victory as she still cares deeply for him.  However, there is a slight hitch, David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), the daughter of the equally wealthy Patrick and Ingrid Tyson (Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson).  Tyson has an exclusive new technology that Linus wants to acquire; this business collaboration will reap additional billions for both families and companies.  If David breaks off the engagement this lucrative deal will go right down the drain.  Linus, although he personally likes Sabrina, is not about to let her turn David's head.  When David is incapacitated by an embarrassing accident at his mother's birthday party, (he sits on a pair of champagne flutes, and he gets his butt stitched), Linus arranges a potent painkiller/sedative to keep David incommunicado and moves in to court Sabrina away from David.  Little does Linus realize he's playing with fire, and not only Sabrina but he as well may wind up being burned?

Here's what works well in this remake over the original: First, the color photography, next the location shooting which has wonderful vistas of Paris, Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard and Long Island.  Being a former Long Island native I particularly appreciated settings I knew very well such as the Long Island Arboretum which was used for the Larrabee greenhouse, and it's back unused entrance that was turned into the entrance of the Larrabee estate.  My favorite though was the village street where Sabrina meets David upon her return from Paris, it was the main street of Huntington Village and many a Sunday in summer my parents would buy ice cream cones for my brothers and me as we strolled and windowshopped.  Eliminating the character of Mr. Larrabee Sr., who was a whiny nuisance in the original, was a wise choice as was building up and liberating the character of Maude Larrabee.  As played by Nancy Marchand she is a sharp, savvy executive who nonetheless deeply loves her sons.  Another plus is the wry, deadpan performance of Dana Ivey as Mack, Linus' executive secretary, or to be politically correct executive administrative assistant.  It's a small part, but she makes every line count. As Fairchild, Sabrina's father, John Wood had a warmer, more affectionate relationship with her than John Williams had in the original.  A nice touch I liked was giving Fairchild who's a widower, a romantic interest, Joanna, the Larrabee housekeeper played by another good character actress Elizabeth Franz.  A dreamy, elegiac theme song composed by John Williams and Alan and Marilyn Bergman entitled ""In the Moonlight"" is memorably rendered by Sting in his most persuasive manner.  Finally eliminating Sabrina's suicide attempt was a definite plus, I found it very distasteful and unnecessary in the original.

To flip the coin, the Paris sequence is overlong, it should have been trimmed, and Sabrina's transformation from grub to butterfly dawdles along.  Her aborted romance with the French photographer goes nowhere and doesn't advance the plot.  Also, speaking of romance too much time is given to David and Elizabeth's; it gets in the way of the story.  Some judicious editing and tightening in these areas would have helped the film's pace and put more emphasis on the Sabrina/David/Linus triangle.

Moving on to the Larrabee brothers, Harrison Ford is light years better than Humphrey Bogart, who seemed too irascible and world weary to pique the interest of the glowingly nubile Audrey Hepburn.  I could never believe she would pick him over William Holden who was younger, more handsome and charming than the dour Bogart.  Harrison Ford is much more appealing, though reserved and tradition bound, he's not ossified.  The viewer believes there is hope for him, as he starts to gradually thaw under Sabrina's charm, he reveals an inner confusion that becomes an appealing vulnerability when he begins to care for her.  Making his screen debut as David Greg Kinnear is a likeable rascal, boyishly handsome, with a quality of youthfulness that works for his character.

Now as to Julia Ormond's Sabrina, the big question does she measure up to Audrey Hepburn's?  No she doesn't, but that shouldn't be held against her, Audrey Hepburn is irreplaceable.  On her own merits, not being compared with Ms. Hepburn's, her Sabrina is charming, a keenly intelligent Cinderella for the 1990's.  She's a lithe, elegant figure, comely with her tossed glossy curls and wide sparkling smile.  In short Ms. Ormond makes a most appealing romantic heroine just is lacking the stardust that made Ms. Hepburn unforgettable.

Once when Sydney Pollack was hosting a Billy Wilder comedy on Turner Classic Movies, he made a self-deprecating comment to the effect about how hard it was to duplicate Wilder's master style, and he knew from his own experience.  I think Mr. Pollack sold himself and his movie short.  This is a guilty pleasure all dyed in the wool romantics should experience at least once.",1309392000,,6163,5.14859437751004

800866,5,6304044836,"Now, I've always loved Audrey Hepburn, one of the most charming actresses ever to shine from the silver screen. However, I have to admit, I find her portrayal of Sabrina horribly dated and stuck in the sexist mire of the 1950s . . . not her fault, of course; but she is so much the child-woman that she comes off childish sometimes, not childlike. So I can't understand the absolute reverence for the original film. Seems like film-school mantra to me (the original Golden Age version will always be revered more than any remake). I also love the way that Julia Ormand's truly ""grown-up"" Sabrina affects Linus NOT by being impish and acting like an overgrown five-year-old, but by seeing through his hardened veneer, which is in fact the way that people truly fall in love. Men don't fall for naive, impish children, no matter how gamine (only in a sexist 1950s world would people buy into that myth); they've always fallen for real women who see their true, inner nature, who upset their world by pricking through their pretenses with razor-sharp perception. And Ormand-Ford carry this falling-in-love dance off perfectly.

As I said, I love Hepburn . . . in other roles (her Eliza Doolittle is a far better acting job on her part, absolutely memorable). In this earlier film in her career, 1950s stereotype trumped reality, at least in my opinion. I far prefer this newer version.",1233619200,2,1382,4.7824267782426775

Meanwhile, David's engaged now to a young doctor, Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly) whose family is also an excellent match for the Larrabees.

When David sees Sabrina, his typical short attention span kicks in, which wreaks havoc with the Tysons.  Linus steps in to divert David.  When he tries to romance Sabrina to get her away from David, Linus realizes the chauffeur's daughter could be the girl for him.

Probably only Sydney Pollack could direct a film that would come close to the original, which starred Humphrey Bogart as Linus and Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina.  The modernization of the story is fascinating.  Harrison Ford makes as good a Linus as Bogart.  Ormond is exquisite, but she doesn't quite live up to the luminous quality of Audrey Hepburn.  Nancy Marchand is the one actor who I think is better than the original Nella Walker.

It's worth seeing both stories just as an interest to see how the story has morphed from one generation to about the third.  You may want both if you love Cinderella stories.

Linus learns of a developing affair between his irresponsible playboy brother David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear / William Holden) and the chauffeur's daughter (Julia Ormond / Audrey Hepburn).  Fearing the situation could interfere with his business plans, since David is engaged to the daughter of his business partner, Linus injects himself into the situation, with the intention of enticing Sabrina away from his brother.  His plan is to quietly entice her to Paris, from which she had recently arrived after a long absence - and then leave her there - making sure she would be comfortable and happy there, but no longer able to unwittingly interfere with his business plans.

Of course, Sabrina is not the immature, impressionable young woman Linus expects, and he is soon caught in a web of his own making.

The two versions of this story are vastly different in the details - in the 1954 release, Sabrina goes to cooking school in France.  In the 1995 version, Sabrina is an intern working at a high end fashion magazine.  Travel to Paris in the 1954 version is via ship, but is via the Concorde in the 1995 film.  It is very interesting seeing how cultural attitudes, particularly the role of women in society, changed in the course of the 40 or so years between the two releases.

I saw the 1995 version first, then went back and rented the original.  Of the two, I found the 1995 version to be much more interesting and fun to watch.  (On the other hand, my parents, who saw the original version in its initial theatrical release, have the opposite opinion!)

The supporting cast is great, delivering some of the best lines in the script - usually as very dry humor, often hysterically funny: Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson deliver superb performances as the mother and father of David Larrabee's Fiance'.  The wonderful Nancy Marchand, in one of her last film roles, is perfect as the mother of Linus and David; and Dana Ivey delivers some really memorable zingers in her role as Linus's executive assistant.

All in all, a sweet, movie sprinkled with witty, dry humor and a few hysterical sight gags: a good choice for a quiet evening in front of the TV with your significant other.

I've watched ""Sabrina"" a lot of times, and I always enjoy it. Perhaps the appeal is seeing a wealthy man do the right thing for a change. The chauffeur's daughter returns home from college in France and dazzles the two wealthy brothers at the family estate. From there, the romance and adventure begins.

I love Harrison Ford--he's very sexy and I never thought Bogie was even attractive, much less sexy and I'm 58 years old.  Julia Ormond is also far prettier than Audrey Hepburn. I liked Hepburn, she was just way too fragile looking.  It was always hard for me to see her as an adult.  In this remake, Linus'(Harrison Ford) transformation from  total workaholic to a man who understood the need to LIVE was gradual and believable.  I saw little, if any, difference in the character as played by Bogart.  And Julia Ormond's Sabrina went convincingly from awkward teen with a major crush on the younger brother (SPOILER ALERT) to sophisticated adult who discovers real love with the older brother, Linus.  I absolutely loved the ending.  Highly recommended.",1187740800,3,856,4.937062937062937
800974,5,6304044836,"Now I admit, I am very biased with this movie because my mother named me after the 1st film, so for me to be a fan of this movie is something of a no-brainer. I own both versions, and I really think each movie should be judged by its own merits. However, if I have to choose which I favor, it would have to be the 1995 re-make because I feel that it speaks more to my generation that the earlier version.

Of course, Humphrey Bogart is the strong, silent type, and Audrey Hepburn is the epitome of elegance, and they played their roles in a way that was accurate and appropriate for 1954, but let's face it, Audrey's sort of elegance for many today is somewhat unattainable. I liked the way Julia Ormond interpreted Sabrina because while she is played as savvy, she is still somewhat vulnerable, and not afraid to be so. I also liked the way she brings out the vulnerability and tenderness in Linus ""the world's only living heart donor"" as played by Harrison Ford.

A few other reasons why I appreciate the remake?

The various characters were better developed in the 2d movie. In the original it was as though they were blending in with the furniture. Linus's admin just cracked me up with her dry humor. The mother was pretty funny at points, too. I also liked the fact that Elizabeth Tyson is played up more intelligently in the re-make than in the original...and that despite the temptation in the end, David honors his commitment to Elizabeth in the end. About the only ""airhead"" was the Angie Dickenson character, but even that role was humorous. I cracked up watching her be all flirty with Linus at the dinner.

Recently, I had a chance to read the entire script from the original 1953 Samuel Taylor play entitled Sabrina Fair: A Woman Of The World. I discovered that the 1995 movie is actually closer to the script of the play than the 1954 movie.  In the original movie, there's no mention of the fact that Fairchild, the chauffer having become a millionaire over the years by listening into Larabee Sr.'s transactions, but the play and the remake do mention it. I feel that part is essential to the story as part of the issue in both movies was class distinction...albeit moreso in the former than in the latter.

My only complaint? I used to have this movie in VHS, and that version included a video of Sting singing the song ""Moonlight.""  I was disappointed that the DVD did not include this beautiful song.",1185667200,,2420,4.524027459954233

This would be great but David is engaged to another woman and this other woman brings with her a very sweet business opportunity for the Larrabee Industries run by elder brother Linus. Linus not a man to let a business opportunity pass him by because of his brother's female distractions sets out to distract the object of David's recent affections. Of course things start to go wrong when Linus develops feelings for Sabrina...

While I prefer the original I still think this version is a great movie. My main problem with it is that the younger brother isn't really good looking enough. I can see him being a playboy but honestly if I can't imagine anyone in their right mind choosing that Greg Kinnear over Harrison Ford. Did you see that guy when he was younger? Indiana Jones? Han Solo? Also when you watch this movie again it feels more dated than the original. That having been said this is a great feel good movie.",1176336000,2,1146,4.590243902439024

It didn't seem to be a case of her not being able to pull off the character; it just seemed like either she or the director could not decide whether they were doing something new or directly remaking the old version.  It would have been better if they had completely cut ties with the past.

The movie also seemed to move quite slowly, and there was very little chemistry between Julia Ormond or either of her suitors.  I love Harrison Ford, but Linus here just came off as a jerk, and Sabrina came off as too stupid to see how mean he was.  The crucial love scene between them was rushed, and far too much time was spent showing how scheming he was.

Sabrina Fairchild (Julia Ormond) is the disrespected and ignored chauffeur's daughter looming through the trees at the secret love of her life, wealthy playboy David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear).

After returning from Paris, Sabrina with a new haircut, change of clothing, and refined poise becomes the latest object of David's affection. The problem is she is the ""chauffeur's daughter"" -- and David is engaged to be married. The relationship interferes with a billion dollar merger. So older brother and financial tycoon Linus Larrabee (Harison Ford) devises an insincere scheme to steal Sabrina's heart away from David. Her vulnerability has an effect on Linus and he begins to recognize there is more to life than business deals.

801152,5,6304044836,"Sabrina is a Cinderella story for modern times, and is also a fine update to the classic film that starred Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden. Sabrina (Julia Ormond) is the plain-looking daughter of a chauffeur to a wealthy family, and comes back transformed after an internship in Paris. She attracts the attention of the family's younger, playboy son (Greg Kinnear), and his older brother (Harrison Ford) must woo Sabrina away before she spoils the marriage/business merger he has been orchestrating.

It's a very charming film, and is one of the few modern romantic comedies that makes you happy for the Hollywood ending instead of gagging at the cliche. It also avoids the typical bathroom humour and cheap gags, and stays relatively true to the original script with emphasis on character and dialogue. Some updates have been made though, sometimes to modernize (the wonder-plastic of the original has now been integrated into a flat screen tv) and sometimes to poke fun at story elements that were more acceptable in the 50s (Bogart could effortlessly kiss his brother's girlfriend and keep it within the family....Ford gets slapped). The cast is excellent all around. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn, but she makes the role her own and actually makes the Cinderella aspect of the plot more convincing. And in true 90's fashion, all the characters are deeper and more sympathetic, giving the cast more to play on.

Sabrina is a fine film, on its own and compared to the original. If you're in the mood for some retro Hollywood charm all modernized into a lovely package, you can't go wrong with this film.",1140307200,4,1630,4.967032967032967
801208,4,6304044836,"The Larrabee's are a old money but moving with the times.  They keep their business growing by keeping up with technology.  Although, a merger by marriage is not out of the question.

Linus (Harrison Ford) is the responsible older brother, David (Greg Kinnear) is his irresponsible younger brother, Maude (Nancy Marchand) is the matriarch of the family.  Their trusted chauffer Fairchild (John Wood) has a gawky teenage daughter Sabrina (Julia Ormand).  Sabrina has a fantasy crush on David.  Fairchild sends Sabrina to Paris to finish her and make her forget David.

Eventually, she returns home, a much more polished woman.  Upon her return, she runs into David who invites her to a party (not knowing she's the chauffeur's daughter.)  David is falling for Sabrina and this does not please Linus (David is to marry Elizabeth Tyson to assure the merger.)  Linus steps in and parts Sabrina and David.  This works a little too well.

This is a remake of a classic Billy Wilder film.  I will state now that the original is a near perfect film with a perfect cast, Bogart, Holden and Audrey.  But this is a fun romance with its own fine cast.

Harrison Ford is excellent as Linus and shows that not only can he be romantic but funny.  This was Greg Kinnear's film debut and proved his likeability and charm (similar to Holden who was the proverbial second lead at the time the original came out).  And Ormand had already proved herself as an accomplished actress in French films, showed that she could handle a Hollywood film.

He had to be disappointed with the result, however, for the resulting comparisons were inevitable. The story stays with the essentials: two brothers-  Ford, the older one, a serious and successful businessman; the other, the irresponsible, handsome playboy played by Greg Kinnear-  vying for the affections of the chaffeur's daughter, Julia Ormand, playing the center role in a variation of the Cinderella tale. It was updated for the modern era, including the politics and finance of corporate take-overs, but otherwise is faithful to the theme of its predecessor. Among other things, one point seems to be clear: why Ford wanted it made. It's a full-blown screen confirmation (do I mean intention?) that our Indiana Jones Superstar still has that ""thing,"" that ability to attract younger women, as his character does in the story. Unfortunately, with a stiff, cardboard performance, he demonstrates none of the irony and vulnerability that Humphrey Bogart brought to this role. Likewise, as ravishing as Ormand can be, she, too, lacks the coquettish charm that Hepburn could provide. Together, they make an unappealing pair, as there's little apparent chemistry between the two stars.  Kinear, for his part, is pretty good, as he lately has developed a real penchant for playing the cad, but he too falls short when put up against William Holden.  To make matters worse, the script doesn't lend too much aid to the cast, lacking the wit and zest of the original. Overall, this is not a worthy re-do, but more simpy boring.
Pollack would be the first one to admit that they don't make movies the way they used to. So, when he hesitated on this one, he should have stayed with his initial instincts.",1114128000,6,1877,4.987220447284345

Still I think Julia makes a good Sabrina.

And I happen to love the lady that plays the spanish maid! I thought she was funny.

Another actor was Harrison Ford. He was good as well.

David played by Greg Kinnear, was even sort of identical to the original David. I was impressed by his acting as well.

This has pretty much the same story line. The father is pretty much the same and I thought he was perfect for the part. This is still an enjoyable remake, though lacking some charm from the first.

Let's put it this way, it's modern!

Overall, I have seen it dozens of time and enjoy it. It was a good movie. I do not reccomend it as a remake, but as a comical enjoyable movie.",1103587200,7,1031,4.251282051282051
801298,5,6304044836,"Before seeing the re-make of this movie I saw the original Sabrina and found it to be very good (but, I think all of Audrey Hepburn's movies are). I love both of the Sabrina movies and I seriously doubt I could choose one over the other. Ford and Ormond both act wonderfully in this re-make. I usually seldmon re-watch movies but, after seeing this one in only 1 week I've seen it 3 times",1097452800,5,388,4.256756756756757
801299,5,6304044836,"This movie is wonderful.  It takes an already-good plot and updates it -- an ""Ever After"" for our classic Cinderella story.  The new Sabrina is more self-sufficient, worldly, and her relationship with Linus is much more mature than the variety of relationships portrayed in any movies from Hollywood's Golden Era.  It's not that the first Sabrina isn't a wonderful classic, but while that one was classic for its fairy-tale quality, and cute scenes that could never be truly be duplicated, this one meets the demands of an audience who today, wants proof that these are actually two people in love.  With Ormond's character, we, the audience, understand and participate in her transition from teenage infatuation to mature love.  There are no petty emotional mind-games here, as are so common in Bogart-era romantic comedies.

In addition, the actors themselves add considerably to the movie's success.  Kinnear's David matures as well, from playboy to partner, and it is easy to see that his relationship with his brother has played no small part in the formation of his playboy image.  Additionally, many of his lines are priceless.  Ormond delivers a few ringers as well, including my favorite, when she refers to Linus as ""the only living heart donor.""

And all this is without speaking of the music.  The soundtrack is excellent.  The score is classy for its infusion of jazz, yet made passionate by John Williams' unmistakable orchestration.  Sting also contributes a haunting ballad.  It all fits beautifully into the movie.

I cry every time I watch this version of Sabrina, and I'm not the crying type.  I highly recommend it -- not as a remake, but on its own merit.",1090195200,10,1676,4.974820143884892
801300,4,6304044836,"In addition to this movie I've also seen the older one starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, and I found that both can be enjoyed almost as two different kinds of films.  Though not without its moments of drama, the Bogart/Hepburn film was lighter, more sparkling and witty, but also a little more shallow.  In that movie, I couldn't understand the attraction between Bogart and Hepburn; they never seem to connect across their age gap.
In this remake of Sabrina, Julia Ormond gives a performance that's more mature and has more depth.  Once she goes to Paris and grows up, she truly grows up (unlike Hepburn, who is loveable but too childlike).  The love that develops between her character and Harrison Ford's is more believable; the movie takes more time and trouble to develop a plausible relationship between the grown up chaffeur's daughter and the billionaire without a social life.  In addition to that, it also has witty dialogue and funny moments, just like the original.",1089849600,49,988,4.927710843373494
801301,1,6304044836,"This is a simply awful remake of the 1950s original with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. Their roles are reprised by Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear.
Of the three leads, Greg Kinnear (David Larrabee) does the best job. I think he is a very underrated actor, especially after his excellent work in ""As Good As It Gets"". He even slightly resembles a young William Holden.
Harrison Ford does an adequate but uninspired job as Linus. Actually both Ford and Bogart were both too at least 20 years old to play Linus, who is supposed to be the older brother, not the father. This detracts a little from the romance, which is supposed to be May-September, not May-Decenber in character, but in the original film, Bogarts sheer charisma carried the day. Harrison Ford has many talents, but romance isn't one of them. He's a good performer in action flicks like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but he just has no chemistry here.
The worst of the pack is Julia Ormond, an otherwise fine British actress (""Smilla's Sense of Snow""). She is everything wrong for Sabrina -- I can only think they picked her for her smooth voice and accent, which do superficially resemble Ms. Hepburn's. But Julia Ormond is too old to play Sabrina (she was in her thirties when it was filmed and Sabrina is supposed to be about 20!) and doesn't come across as an ingenue. She is just plain painful in the early scenes, where the costume/makeup people went into overtime making her a frump with mounds of frizzy hair. Later, she is ""transformed"" with a short haircut but unlike Audrey Hepburn -- one woman who was utterly enchanting and beautiful with very very short hair, a hard look to carry off -- Julia looks just awful. It's an unflattering cut and served only to make her look even more mature, rather than sophisticated and charming.
Much of the delightful, sparkling dialogue has been chopped out, towards what end I can't imagine. Also, instead of going to Paris and training as a chef (a very acceptable modern profession for a woman!), they have decided to make Sabrina a Vogue fashion photographer (despite no previous interest or background in photography OR fashion). Frankly, I think the writers were getting ""Sabrina"" mixed up with Audrey Hepburn's other great classic ""Funny Face"", where she plays a frump-become-fashion-model. There is no other believable explanation! This also ruins her Paris experience, which was handled so delightfully in the original. If that isn't bad enough, they have innocent little Sabrina having a love affair, a point which terribly muddles the whole idea that she is a naive virgin pining for David. OK, frankly, not many girls stay virgins that long these days, but Sabrina had a reason for doing so and the additional lover (who is quite attractive) really skews the storyline off course.
As a fashion buff, one of the great charms of the original film is the utterly exquisite, iconic fashions wore by Audrey Hepburn, who was not only one of the most beautiful actresses of her day but one of the most stylish women ever, period. (Both Edith Head and Herbert Givenchy designed her costumes.) Every outfit she wore in the original film is an absolute style classic. Some, like the dress she wears to the Larrabee's party after returning from Paris -- a white, strapless gown with black embroidery and a long swishy train -- are so absolutely breathtaking that the hairs on the back of your neck go up when you see her.
In contrast, the remake ""Sabrina"" has some of the lamest, plainest costumes I have ever seen. In the identical scene (the party), Sabrina wears a drab, dark green evening dress. Not that Julia Ormond isn't attractive, but there is nothing dramatic or stunning about her appearance that would make every head turn when she enters...it's even more lame when other characters, like Mrs. Larrabee (the late Nancy Marchand, in her last role) make comments about how ravishing she is.
Actually, while the filmmakers were ""updating"" Sabrina to be politically correct, I wonder why they didn't consider making Sabrina and her chaffeur father African American or Hispanic? Certainly that would reflect the reality in the 90s of what ethnic background servants to the very rich are likely to come from. (How often do you see a British chaffeur, really? Almost never! and why would Sabrina, who was raised in the US have a British accent anyways?) I think an interraccial romance would emphasize the cultural/economic differences between the Larrabees and the Fairchilds in a way that modern audiences could truly understand. BTW: I think Hallie Berry or Jennifer Lopez might have done very well in that kind of remake, and they each have a ""star"" quality that Ms. Ormond utterly lacks. Well, just my two cents.
At any rate, this is a lifeless, tired and completely unnecessary remake. Do yourself a BIG favor and rent the original with Hepburn and Bogart and try to forget that this bloated remake was ever made.",1088467200,13,4967,4.851590106007067
801302,3,6304044836,"""Sabrina"" is a nice remake of a classic film (just invoking the names involved in the original -- Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, William Holden, and Billy Wilder -- makes you wonder why anyone dared to remake it) . . . a nice romance filled with good, not great performances.  ""Sabrina"" is a great example of what major Hollywood studios can do when things generally click -- it's a good little movie that (fortunately) doesn't seem to be trying too hard.
Essentially a retelling of the classic ""ugly duckling"" story, ""Sabrina"" focuses on the maturation of the title character (Julia Ormond, when Hollywood was still in love with her).  Sabrina, the daughter of the chauffeur for the fabulously wealthy Larrabee clan, starts the movie as a dumpy little girl, watching the fantastic Larrabee Long Island parties from up in her tree through the world's most god-awful spectacles.  Completely infatuated with the Larrabee's younger son David (Greg Kinnear, in a perfect role for him), Sabrina mistakenly confesses her feelings to the older brother Linus (Harrison Ford) before heading off to Paris for her education.
While in Paris, Sabrina works at one of those dream internships that people get in the movies - assisting photographers shoot models for magazine ads.  Surrounded by beautiful, artistic people in a beautiful, artistic city, Sabrina finds herself and emerges as a gorgeous, sophisticated woman.
Sabrina returns to Long Island and promptly runs into David, who doesn't recognize her as the daughter of his chauffeur and shamelessly flirts with her even though he is engaged to another gorgeous woman, Dr. Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), who is just about too perfect for words.  Linus, of course, being the businessminded drone that he is, instantly recognizes both Sabrina and David's infatuation with her.
This poses a problem -- Linus wants David to stay with Dr. Tyson, both for David's happiness (as he points out to David in a fun scene, ""she won't be a burden"") and because Elizabeth's dad Patrick (Richard Crenna) is in tense negotiations with Linus and the negotiations would go better if they are family.  So Linus sets out to seduce Sabrina to keep her away from David -- after neutralizing David in a most creative fashion involving a champagne flute.
Of course, during his efforts to seduce Sabrina, the hard-hearted Linus, who has always been a tyrant of a businessman, even as a child, falls for Sabrina, too.
As you can see, a fairly predictable march through the numbers of romantic comedy.  The movie's charm is in its execution.  Director Sydney Pollack brings the best out of his talented cast, particularly Harrision Ford, who returns to the comic form he demonstrated in ""Working Girl"" but has been lacking in so many of his other efforts.
The only jarring note in the movie is Sabrina's over-insistence of bringing up Paris in every conversation.  When looking at an old building on Martha's Vineyard, Sabrina inexplicably snots, ""In Paris, they would consider that brand-new.""  While it's not surprising that she would return from Paris quite affected by the experience, at times in the movie it comes across as snobby rather than charming.
But this is a minor quibble.  ""Sabrina"" is what it is -- an attractive comedy about attractive people falling in love in attractive settings by doing and saying attractive things.  Not great, not inventive, not surprising, but pretty darn good.",1086825600,6,3423,5.060390763765541
801303,2,6304044836,"The original Sabrina was a classic, with three of the greatest stars of all time -- Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden -- being directed by Billy Wilder, one of the greatest directors of all time. To be sure, the producers of this remake did their best to duplicate the magic of the first film. It's directed by the great Sydney Pollack and stars Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood, Richard Crenna, Angie Dickinson and Lauren Holly. In one way, the film is better for the casting of Harrison Ford in place of Humphrey Bogart. Ford probably wasn't much younger than Bogart was when he made his version. But Bogart seemed older than the 54 he was when the original was made. Ford, in contrast, seems much more youthful ( even with Linus Larabee's stuffy persona) and more of a natural match for Sabrina.
However, all of these quality elements are negated by the casting of Julia Ormond as Sabrina Fairchild. To be sure, Ormond is a beautiful woman. However, she has the charisma of a pile of wet toilet paper. She has absolutely none of the allure of her predecessor in the role and comes off very, very badly because of it. I know it's unfair to compare most actresses with the irreplaceable Audrey Hepburn, but this, after all, is the role she created, so she is being held to a higher standard. I knew there was a problem with the movie when I found myself more attracted to Lauren Holly as Greg Kinnear's jilted fiancee than Julia Ormond as the lead.

I agree with the reviewer who said that julia ormond should be the actress for ""The Audrey Hepburn Story"" which I would not recommend anyone to see, not Jennifer Love Hewitt. I checked out other Julia Ormond films, investing in the purchase of Smilla's Sense of Snow, Legends of the Fall, Nostradamus and have always found that a rewatch of Ormond's Sabrina was a better use of time than watching her other films. I have always wondered why Julia Ormond made so few films and so little is known of her. I would have liked to see more of her in films where an audrey hepburn calibre actress was called for. incidentally, audrey was hepburn's film name.

Several years after seeing the remake in the theatre, I watched it again some Sunday afternoon, and was surprised by the affect it had. When not compared to the sassy, comical, melodramatic romance of the first movie, this new version - considered on its own merit - is a pensive, mature romance that takes its time considering small details, as Ormond emerges as Ford's humble equal, rather than being duped by infatuation.
I watch it about every other year now, and as I grow older, I only enjoy more this movie's careful attentiveness to detail and the lack of emotional manipulation characteristic of Hollywood romances.",1078704000,11,939,5.064516129032258
801344,2,6304044836,"This is only my second online movie review--I felt quite compelled to speak out upon seeing a cable broadcast of this film. First off, let me say that I LOVE Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond, and really like Greg Kinnear. I really, *really* wish I could like this movie, but I find it so incredibly pointless ande lame as a remake! That is, if you've seen the original version with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden. No question--it's a noble effort, but I'm sorry--there is simply NO COMPARISON as to how superior this story is interpreted in the original. Why try to re-make perfection?
I'm very bummed out seeing these three excellent actors trying to recreate--or, re-realize--what is so classically timeless and charming and something that so belongs to three other actors that can never be matched! Julia Ormond is so beautiful in her own right, and she won my eternal admiration as a contemporary screen icon for her performance in ""Smilla's Sense of Snow,"" but she cannot--and should not try to--compare with Hepburn. Ditto for Ford in his recreation of the Bogart role. I say, let all three of these contemporary actors become/remain screen icons in their own right/time, but there is no way they can compete with the screen icons of that other time via this movie. Furthermore, Audrey could not replace Julia in ""Smilla,"" nor could Bogie replace Harrison in the numerous roles Ford has made classic and memorable. The updated scenarios/references in this remake are, for the most part, trivial and empty. Please, go buy/rent the original 1954 version of this film. It is simply NOT TO BE MISSED! There is a magic in it that you just won't find in this re-make, and I'm sorry (for these actors) to have to say it.",1066521600,4,1738,4.816053511705686

I guess I'm too much of a Bogart fan to allow any man to take his place. Harrison Ford, I think, was much past his prime in this movie... And nobody can say the wonderful lines Boggy did... ""It's all in the family""... Whenever Ford said all the lines, they just fell flat. Anyway... If you liked the old one, don't watch this one!

This is a gem of a flick that never quite got the respect it deserved. Julia Ormond shined in this film. It is a true pity her American Film Career never quite lifted off.
The casting of Harrison Ford was brilliant as he played off all of the character's facets.
The expansion of the character of David is the best improvement over the original film. Instead of just being a vapid womanizer, he actually gets a personality and you find yourself actually believing that he would support his brother instead of scratching your head about his change of heart.
The cast, as I said earlier, is brilliant in this film. The expanded plot lines and twists only enhance the experience.
The only detractor is that the sound is a touch funny in the film. In a few scenes, Harrison Ford sounds like he is having an asthma attacks instead of breathing.

To have someone that can't act and isn't at all attractive play a role you once played?  The horror!  I just can't believe they actually remade such a masterpiece.",1056499200,6,445,4.4875
801348,5,6304044836,"Sabrina (played by Julia Ormond) was a geeky loner who sat up in a tree watching and fantasizing about a man named David (played by Greg Kinnear) - a lovable, charming ladies' man. She later spends a few years in Paris, and upon her return home, she is transformed into a sensual, sophisticated woman. Unknowingly, David picks her up after she was seen hitchhiking (albeit with a different appearance), and slowly begins to fall for her. They both seem to get the chance to have what they (or rather Sabrina) wanted a few years back.
And here is where the story takes a few twists. David's older, wiser, and seemingly callous businessman brother Linus (played by Harrison Ford) notices the sparks between David and Sabrina, and immediately concocts a scheme to break them apart. The reason for this is because the business of which Linus is involved, was going to reach an agreement for a nice business deal involving the parents of David's then-fiance, Liz (played by Lauren Holly), but soon realizes if David falls for Sabrina, then he'll no longer have much interest in Liz, and therefore, the deal would be jeopardized. So, Linus takes it upon himself to try his best to get Sabrina out of the picture. He goes to low lengths in trying to keep David and Sabrina apart - one of them is the darkly hilarious scheme which involved keeping David on heavy sedatives, which were really intended to be minor painkillers due to an unfortunate accident involving drinking glasses. These would keep him bed-ridden and disoriented. Inbetween all of this, Linus manipulates Sabrina by trying to pass himself off as a subtly charming and romantic guy, which in return gains her affections. But, something goes haywire in the scheme -- Linus starts to fall in love with her.
It must be mentioned that the ending scene (the one before Linus flies off to Paris to find Sabrina) was quite clever, spellbindingly & inexplicably funny, but in a subtle, classy, European manner. Doesn't seem like the kind of thing you see in many films, especially in the romantic heading.
As of yet, I haven't seen the original version of this starring Audrey Hepburn, so I won't bother making any comparisons. The story is quite charming, and features a nice amalgamation of humor, wit, romance and intelligence. The performances were all well-done, and Julia Ormond was quite lovable as the perceptive, innocent, elegant and vulnerable Sabrina. Harrison Ford gave a nice performance as the cold, scheming, lackadaisical-in-temperament Linus, which really doesn't seem like much of a stretch for him (the temperament part anyway), and Greg Kinnear as always is charming and charismatic.

These are two different films--black and white versus color, Bogart versus Ford, then versus now.  They share a plot form, but we the audience truly need not compare the two--better to enjoy them as two distinct films, each offering its own blessing.
Having said that, I confess that I enjoyed in this modern Sabrina what others have criticized, namely its ambiguity.  We don't always see into our characters' minds so that every move is telegraphed.  Instead, we retain some sense of mystery and uncertainty, which both produce lasting interest in the characters.  Vulnerability is heightened, a neat and tidy ending is averted.  This makes the film richer and more durable.
Pollack also achieves a fine look for his film, and a leisurely pace for unfolding the story.  Enjoy ""Sabrina,"" a true original.",1046736000,6,888,5.125
801351,1,6304044836,"The 1995 SABRINA was marketed as a remake of the 1954 Audrey Hepburn-Humphrey Bogart-William Holden film--adapted, of course, to modern sensibilities but not necessarily ""improved."" I'll confine my remarks to those parameters.
Can you have a ""Cinderella story"" in a democracy? The original fairy tale and film were set in a world of strictly defined class and gender roles which the protagonists struggled to transcend. There is no snobbery in the world of the 1995 Larrabees--the fuddy-duddy senior Larrabee has been conveniently dispatched, the matriarch is a tough-talking old broad but good at heart, the chauffeur Fairchild (whom Bogart bemusedly called ""a terrible snob"" in the original) drove the elder Larrabee ""with the partition down"" for years but never improved his near-Cockney accent. There is really no death--Sabrina's suicide attempt (which viewers on this site found too gross) has been expunged.
Nor is there cruelty. In the original, David/Holden is the younger brother gifted from birth with all the graces, which he uses to satisfy his yen of the moment with the assurance that someone will clean up after him. Sabrina/Hepburn goes to Paris a child (presumably fresh from high school; David speaks of her two years later as 22 but is probably boosting) and returns as glib and beautiful as David himself, fully aware of the harm she's about to do. The film is about her redemption by kissing the frog.
The remake fudges all of this. The dance at the Larrabee home to which Sabrina gets herself invited the night of her return was originally a party celebrating David's engagement, at which his neglect of his fiancee for the stunningly gowned Sabrina upset both families, threatened the planned merger and prompted Linus's intervention at the tennis court. In the remake David's fiancee is in California for a medical conference, reducing the conflict to an ""I don't like the looks of this!"" on her father's part. Sabrina's grand entrance has been replaced by her slipping aboard unobtrusively as one more pretty girl; she's more Judy Garland than Princess Grace, confiding her fears to David's sympathetic Mickey Rooney.
Going off to Paris for two years (to study cooking, Sabrina's late mother's calling, rather than ""find herself"") was tantamount to exile for working-class people in the Fifties (the middle class might manage an annual visit home.) Why Sabrina's benefactors sent her off to work for VOGUE in a klutzy hairdo and dirndl (she'd be perfect as the Village bookstore clerk in a remake of FUNNY FACE), and why she didn't get a trim till she came home, I can't imagine.
Julia Ormond was most appealing in her smiling-through-tears scenes near the end, but I never really believed her conversion. David/Kinnear asked Linus/Ford the pivotal question after Linus had finished extolling the virtues of his beautiful, intelligent, socially committed fiancee--""Why don't YOU marry her? DON'T ANSWER THAT!"" The answer is, of course, that all the problems would have been solved and there would have been no SABRINA 1995.",1042329600,4,3049,5.149193548387097
801352,4,6304044836,"I'll spare the details of the plot since it's quite clear already.  Frankly, I found nothing extrodinary about the acting done by Julia Ormond.  She looks the same, acts the same, and I see no change in the Sabrina character.  I think the only attractions to this version are  Harrison Ford, who does an excellent job as the older brother, and Greg Kinnear, who plays the younger brother.  However, I am doing a 'comparison' which is very unfair because the older cast of the original had that 'classic' touch of the time and Audrey Hepburn plays all her parts with a believable and natural grace that is hard to come by in today's actors.  I really felt like giving this movie only 3 stars, but it was only because of Acting reasons that I had qualms with  I decided to give it 4 stars instead because it would be somewhat biased of me since I am a Drama Student so I look at these things more closely than the usual viewer.

801427,5,6304044836,"I was surprised at how good this movie is.  A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart.  The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.

And let's just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this.  No way could this be anything near as good as the original.  And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded.  Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn's title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden.  Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man.  He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot.  In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances.  Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.

He did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be.  I mean, Cinderella move over.  Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven.  It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur's daughter than what transpires here.

Quickly here's the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate.  She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name.  When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.

The basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina's character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic.  Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow's end she gets.  I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): ""They want romance, they want woman's fantasy?  They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting?  How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers?  She can take her pick.  We've give 'em romance, we'll give 'em dreams come true!""  And they do.  Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.

Of course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla's Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson.  I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this ""let them eat cake"" line: ""We thought we'd use recycled paper"" (for the wedding invitations).

The script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy.  For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: ""America is my country and Paris is my home.""  (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)

I also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me-observes with perfect decorum, ""I'm embarrassed that you're somewhere else.""

Memorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt.  By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.  I especially liked it when he sadly confessed: ""I was sent to deal with you.  I sent myself.""

It is probably better if you haven't seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons.  Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez.  They really are very different people.  And comparing Billy Wilder's 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber's.

Bottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the ""only surviving heart donor"" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.

801428,4,6304044836,"This movie isn't the best, I'll be completely up front.  Julia Ormond is just completely lacking of charm, and if you've seen the original, it comes across even more plainly.  However - it really is a fun film with witty dialogue that I find watching over and over despite its problems.
The banter and camaraderie of the house servants, as well as the sharp wit of Linus and Mrs. Larabee, provide a humorous and entertaining aspect that makes this film worth owning for a rainy day.",1039478400,2,482,4.593023255813954

Which is a shame since it's a remarkably well-made, smooth romantic comedy.  Julia Ormond is exceedingly charming, and if her leading man doesn't quite deliver his usual suave charm, the excellent cinematography and classy musical score make up for some of the disappointment.
The story of Sabrina never fails to charm, though, regardless of the players.  Her awkward dreamer character grows up, and then beguiles and humanizes the awkward, crusty businessman.  Pick up the classic version for a night when a master's work can be appreciated.  This version is light and cheering for a relaxing evening.",1031184000,4,736,5.151260504201681

All i knew was that when i first saw this movie, i was touched.
I was moved by the sweetness, by that girlishness, and by that thing that made that wonderfull story so authentic even by today's standards.
Sabrina's story - in this latest producsion- didn't loose much of its old charm.
The actors - if not Hepborn & Bogart -than at list the wonderful
Ormond & Ford.
With all my admiration for the late Bogy, i still think that ford has done a much better job on the older brother,
and Ormond came quit close to our beloved Audrey, so close that she has in-fact captured that certain magic.
The story is still the same though,: A girl falls in love with her idole, girl lives home, girl comes back -refined-, idole makes a pass at her- not recognizing her-, and so on to the plonder with the older brother and ofcourse the inevitable HAPPY-END.

801510,5,6304044836,"Julia Ormond was well-chosen to fill Audrey Hepburn's shoes in the title role. Compared to the 1954 original, this 1995 version has a fresher, more fast-paced, less archaic look to it, and a cast of more assertive females who are accomplished women in their own right rather than just clinging-vine rich girls who are determined to marry well. The suicide attempt of the title character is happily, left out of this version.
 Fanny Ardant is warm and personable as the Vogue Magazine editor who takes Sabrina under her wing after her arrival in Paris. The temptation to have sex with a co-worker to ease her lonliness in response to her learning about David Larrabee's engagement is tasefully and honorably dealt with by Patrick Bruel's character, Louis, and the scenes of Paris are sheer delight. The original ""Sabrina"" introduced me to the beautiful song, "" La Vie en Rose"", which gets a little air time in this version as well.
 John Wood has a firmness about him mixed with paternal warmth as he worries about the daughter he has raised by himself. Elizabeth Franz is endearing as his potential love interest. The late Nancy Marchand plays a matriarch who knows how to put her foot down concerning her less-reliable younger son, David.
 As David, Greg Kinnear is less oily, less sleazy, and somehow, less irritating than William Holden was in the 1954 original. Interestingly, it is mentioned in this remake that David has been in and out of several relationships, but not several marriages, as was the case when William Holden had the part. Perhaps it's because we live in an era where a considerable number of women are less naive and more likely to avoid someone with such a bad marital track record. But we are thankfully spared the details of how far David goes in his relationships.
 A rugged-looking Harrison Ford gives a performance that is more than faintly reminiscent of Bogart's when the latter played Linus Larrabee in the original. He is the responsible, brilliantly scholastic brother that any woman who thinks of marrying should want to marry. But he's always busy. One of the most poignant scenes in the whole film is when he admits his lonliness to Sabrina during a business trip to Cape Cod. But his growing desire to impress the woman he has known since childhood with his softer side results in his doing an admirable act of charity along the way. Linus really lights up and lightens up in Sabrina's presence.
 Ormond's performance is filled with delicate nuances as she goes from an obsessive, mousy girl to a sophisticated woman. Her make-up job and tastes in clothing after she returns from Paris are beautiful, suitable, and very refined.

 Miriam Colon has great comic timing as the Spanish maid, Rosa. Her story about immigrating to the United States, told in response to learning about the adjustment problems Sabrina was having in France, is one with which anyone who has constantly had to move could easily identify. Dana Ivey is equally witty as Linus' prim secretary.
 Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson as David's future in-laws are sharp, offbeat, and engaging, as is Lauren Holly as David's admirably accomplished pediatrician fiancee.
 Amid breathtaking, sharp cinematography, and a subtle,elegant musical score, the principals in this drama make some crucial, life-altering decisions. My copy of this film, interestingly enough, is smack in the middle of two other films which end with the male lead asking a woman to take him back, namely, "" Forever Young"", and "" Circle of Friends"". But in conclusion, I must say that in an era full of movie remakes, this one is outstanding.",1002585600,4,3618,4.918032786885246

I still have it and it's about worn out I watch it so much.  The actors that they got to play the originals were amazing (Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford, and Greg Kinnear).  I've never seen a remake that had such good actors.  Where they film the movie is beautiful (especially Paris), it's clean, and it makes you feel good.  There aren't many movies around these days that do that.  It's a movie that you can watch with your family.  It is definitely a change from the normally macho Harrison Ford, but it shows the softer side of him and how versitile he is as an actor.  I definitely encourage anyone who has never watched this movie to rent it or buy it, I guarantee that you will enjoy it.",995932800,5,865,4.131736526946108
801513,5,6304044836,"As much as I enjoy the 1954 original, the 1995 remake was a surprisingly good romantic comedy sleeper.  Both films are great in their own right, for different reasons.  Harrison Ford who at first seems like a fish out of water because of all the macho rolls we're accustomed to seeing him portrait, actually pulls off playing the billionaire geek, Linus Larrabee.  Which is a true credit to his acting skills.  Julia Ormond is wonderful as Sabrina, and so was Audrey.  Both were very convincing in the role of Sabrina as being vulnerable and having good character strength.  And it's close, but Greg Kinnear may have been even more of a rogue/devil may care, David Larrabee.  Where this film gets better is the addition of all the great romantic music, and the beautiful scenes of Paris.  Using the two French stars Fanny Ardant & Patrick Bruel was also a nice touch.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that, everyone who had a role in this movie played their character to a tee.  If you enjoy romantic comedies, and/or love Paris, as I do both, then this film is not to be missed.  The only complaint I have, is that when my wife bought the music CD, the French song that is being played in the movie right after the disco scene ""dancing with Louis"" where she pins a pamphlet on her bulletin board, is not on the CD.  How could they make such an egregious mistake.  My other problem is, when in the heck is the DVD going to come out.
For those of you who will be traveling to Paris and want to visit one of the most beautiful scenes in the movie.  Where she writes her last letter home to her Father.  That's in Montmartre, just East of Sacre Coeur, down the escalliers (stairs).  Don't get your hopes too high, the cafe isn't there, just the yellow awning is all that remained when we were there.  It was probably just a prop set up for the one scene in the movie.  The romantic tete e tete with Julia and Harrison, 13 Rue de Beaux Arts, didn't look quite the same as in the movie, I think.  The one location we didn't find is the little square with the fountain, where Julia and Fanny met and talked. I suspect it's in the Latin Quarter, does anybody out there know?  If you do, write a review and comment.",972691200,11,2219,4.326876513317191
801514,5,6304044836,"Elegant soirees, fashion shoots, strolls about Paris, romance, witty dialogue - this movie has it all.  An amazingly strong cast graces this light-hearted romantic comedy that also has a wonderful soundtrack.  The  music truly adds another sweeping dimension to the film.  Julia Ormond is  stunning yet sweet as Sabrina, and her transformation from the dowdy,  lovelorn adolescent to glamorous sophisticate was very well done.  Her  quiet, smooth voice opens the movie and flows over tranquil scenes of the  luxurious Larrabee estate, Harrison Ford is the stoic Linus Larrabee the  cold, sharp businessman (""the world's only living heart-donor"")  who learns to love under the gentle guidance of a mature and wise Sabrina.  Greg Kinnear is an extremely likable David, the younger son.  Nancy  Marchand is a hoot as Maude, the matriarch, who dons some rather elaborate  evening gowns!  John Wood is a most distinguished chauffeur, and audiences  will respect him more than the original.  Even Mac, the loyal, ever so  efficient secretary, has some great one-liners.
The original made me  squirm with Hepburn's portrayal of an embarrassingly  immature, unbalanced  Sabrina.  The remake stresses her psychological maturing (""I found  myself in Paris"") in addition to the physical makeover.  More  importantly, Bogart and Hepburn didn't give me the same thrill that Ford  and Ormond do.  I think they really enjoyed making this movie together -  their shared smiles and laughter on Martha's Vineyard and in the Moroccan  restaurant seemed genuine.  It's more than good acting.  I know several  will disagree with me, but even those who prefer the original have to admit  that the scenes in Paris, beautifully shot on location, are a vast  improvement to the old version.

801561,5,6304044836,"Being a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, I NEVER thought I would find the remake as entertaining as the original. But was I ever wrong!
Julia Ormond's transformation to the luminously beautiful ""woman of the world""  Sabrina, is every bit as believable as Hepburn's earlier transformation.  Ormond's chemistry with Harrison Ford is far  more believable and charming,  as Linus tries to distract Sabrina from her obsessive fascination with his  younger brother, David, now engaged to the daughter of a business  associate.
Harrison Ford gives his portrayal of Linus the needed humanity  that Bogart's portrayal lacked. Linus, in Ford's capable hands, revealed  the weight of being the older, more responsible brother, in whom the family  fortune rested. Yet, Linus yearned to fall in love, and until Sabrina's  return from Paris, and their mock courtship, he didn't believe it could  ever happen. I really believed he was falling in love with Ormond's  Sabrina.
Ford's Linus seemed genuinely heartbroken when he admitted the  truth about the Paris trip to Sabrina. He watched with dismay, as her heart  broke, to realize he'd been playing her for a fool during their romance.  That's why their reunion in Paris, at the end, was so satisfying!
Greg  Kinear's David was also more humane and less calculating, than William  Holden's in the original version. I felt David's anger at his brother's  deceptive romance of Sabrina. And so  his  punching Linus was a more  realistic response.
I highly recommend this movie to all romantics! It  also makes a great date film. A great update of an earlier classic, this  film may well become a classic in its own right.",947116800,20,1648,5.044609665427509
801562,5,6304044836,"I don't care what anyone says; there's no need to compare 1995's Sabrina to the Audrey Hepburn classic. This one, in my opinion, is clearly superior than the original.

By default, film as an art form has evolved and matured far beyond where it was almost half a century ago. Unless the original was of undeniable achievement in every aspect from technical to artistic (which the original Sabrina wasn't, if we are being honest), the remake will usually be more refined due to the natural evolution of film making techniques, storytelling, and more sophisticated sensibility. Side by side, the 1995 SABRINA is more clever in dialogue, plot, and direction. Let's not get into how the Hepburn version is better simply because it's the original, or a legendary actress was in it. Remakes aren't inherently inferior, and Julia Ormond is an actress that commands respect, as her acting career has demonstrated. On top of that, Harrison and Greg made much more charming and convincing Linus and David than the original cast.

Another touch that made it better was changing Sabrina's Paris trip to becoming a photographer instead of a cook. It gave her so much more confidence and validated her as an individual who's accomplished in artistic achievement, and the artistic endeavor matched her sentimental personality far better.

It was  also a great move to have Linus truly be the head of the family by taking out the father. That way, Linus became even more of a figure to be intimidated by, and the weight on his shoulders seemed that much heavier.

The original Sabrina didn't do a very good job at convincing us why Linus should fall in love with Sabrina. The 1995 version did a great job showing us how Sabrina managed to melt Linus's icy exterior by being sensitive, understanding, encouraging, and challenging to him.

What can I say? I love 1995's version. If you haven't seen it, please give it a try. You will be delighted.",944092800,35,1929,4.848024316109423
