We wanted to update this title and found that our options on this topic were limited. This DVD turns out to be exactly what we had before--the same still amateurish graphics and the same voice over, only set on DVD. Good info, but VERY dated graphics and the kind of presentation that turns kids off.",1258329600,6,474,4.523255813953488
8425431,1,B0001Q47Q6,"As a senior English teacher I have been looking for a video to use with my students. This dvd provides an adequate overview of the story; however, I question parts of its interpretation AND information. I have read other reviews that rate the contents of this dvd as more appropriate to a junior high audience. I do not disagree with that comment; however, I find if difficult to imagine the Aeneid being read and discussed with that age group. We are also having some difficulty with the audio on this dvd, and it's brand new! I would love to find a source for a really intelligent and interesting examination of Virgil's Aeneid.",1231718400,14,630,4.633928571428571
8425432,1,B0001Q47Q6,"This DVD has to be the most disappointing purchase I have made from Amazon. All others have been of excellent value.
I thought this DVD would provide useful material for a class of 14/15 year old pupils in my Latin class and would analyse the Aeneid in a mature way, with perhaps a few scenes acted out. Instead, the illustrations were puerile and the commentary very superficial. It may suit a class of 6/7 year olds with its approach but how many of them are there out there wanting an introduction to one of the greatest poems ever written?",1204675200,19,543,4.494949494949495
