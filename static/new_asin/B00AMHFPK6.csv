5451194,5,B00AMHFPK6,this video confessions from the grassy knoll has lots of very shocking information about the assassination of president john f kennedy that was not reveald to the public before this is a very good video.,1369267200,12,203,4.828571428571428
5451195,5,B00AMHFPK6,"This latest dvd from Wim Dankbaar reveals that 2 FBI agents witnessed the autopsy of JFK,noting who was there and all the wounds in detail. The shot in the back did not exit his body,only went in about 2 inches at a downward angle and another FBI agent found this bullet on Kennedy's stretcher !!!,so no more magic bullet theory,the evidence in writing from the FBI themselves
and Hoover ignored it,I wonder why. Two shells found in Book Depos.,later changed to three. No prints on rifle say FBI,later found
after LHO had died. Comdr. Pitzer who had copies of the film taken at the autopsy was put on a CIA hit list and later died very
suspiciously,where is that film?Also written evidence from the embalmer of JFK stating that he plugged a small hole in the right
temple area.
This dvd should be viewed by everyone as solid evidence that some FBI agents did their job properly,while others like Hoover
chose to ignore statements which would have meant the Single Bullet Theory could never of existed. Over to Arlen Specter....",1366934400,86,1027,4.711111111111111
5451196,3,B00AMHFPK6,"There are excellent, high quality video interviews with noteworthy witnesses, especially Sibert in this video.  The production is well put together.  However, the inclusion of Judyth Vary Baker as someone with first hand knowledge stretches things.  Important also is an extremely good blowup of the Moorman photo and the figure behind the fence.  There are a number of videos which may not be open to question and, though I find straws grasped at in this one, I am still glad I plurchased it.",1482537600,,493,4.903614457831325

Sure it's mostly just conjecture but I appreciate additional 'evidence' regarding the murder of President Kennedy.

The botching, lying, conniving and secretive manipulation of all assassination evidence, witnesses and procedures just go to show that the lying thug cops and deceptive politicians has been the 'business as usual' for decades and decades.  Most likely always the way thing have been.

5451240,5,B00AMHFPK6,I am a JFK assassination junkie and this DVD shed more light on this topic. I was in the 6th grade at the time this horrible tragedy happened. Anyone who believes that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin is a damn fool. That would be like believing in Santa Claus. The Warren Commission was the biggest pack of pathological liars this century will ever know. And they buried the truth. When Lee Harvey Oswald said he was the patsy he was not lying. The assassination took place entirely on the ground at the grassy knoll of Dealey Plaza. And there were 2 possibly 3 shooters. And they were contracted from France. And they are more than likely still alive today. And you can also blame the Secret Service as well for such a botched job of protecting our President that day. They should of fired every agent the day after that assassination or even sooner. They DID NOT do their job the way they were trained. They were well aware of the danger imposed on JFK going to Dallas that day and did not take extra precautions to secure the entire area as JFK's limo went through the area of Dealey Plaza where our poor President was ambushed. There was no way that JFK's limo should of been first in line and that was a change that LBJ made at the last moment the truth be known. JFK's limo should of been at least 3 cars back. I feel a lot of times that the Secret Service was a part of the conspiracy.,1408665600,6,1395,4.307984790874524

retired FBI agents review those harrowing proceedings and their interviews and commentary are presented in a very clear and compelling way.

If these individuals, including the more exotic witnesses like Judy Vary Baker and James Files, are actring, I'll hang up my rock and roll shoes.

Not to play spoiler here, but if you ever doubted the single bullet theory, or thought that there were four shots, not three; that Oswald had two aliases not self-generated; that Gerald Ford admitted to ""adjusting"" the bullet position from about 5 inches down from JFK's neck to right through his neck...check this out immediately.

5451251,5,B00AMHFPK6,"This is without a doubt proof that the JFK assassination was conspiratorial and that there were many close to the action that knew it.  It is reassuring to know that some of them are willing to bring their knowledge forward even at this late date.  I think a grand jury should be used to bring those that are less willing to ""get honest"" to the tables of justice.",1394064000,4,363,4.323529411764706

Also we hear from a fellow named Jimmy Files, claiming to be The grassy knoll shooter. It is a short interview of how he shot Kennedy, there is a more detailed interview with him in a DVD titled ""I shot JFK"", it is 2 hrs, 40 mins and available here on Amazon.
This DVD, of course is subject to your ability to swallow as much of this as truth as you are willing to. We may never know the truth about JFK's murder but one thing I know for sure, it wasn't Oswald.",1391126400,3,553,4.177570093457944

5451254,4,B00AMHFPK6,"For most people, the assassination of President Kennedy was, and still is, an unsolved crime.  This work by Chauncey Marvin Holt helps fill in the gaping holes left by those who presumably investigated the killing.  Although we will never fully know the how and why of Kennedy's murder, this account brings stunning and irrefutable evidence to the questions.  Those who appear on this film bring tons of credibility to the conversation.  Those who were closest to the event, yet were never questioned, get a chance to tell their story with power and clarity.  Anyone interested in this ""crime of the century"" will appreciate the professional manner in which it is organized and presented.",1390003200,3,688,5.053097345132743

5451257,4,B00AMHFPK6,"It offers the best balanced view of the details about JFK's assassination, but I only gave it four stars because it only justified four shots when there is evidence that nine or ten shots were fired from three or four locations.  However it is a very good summary of the murder as it gives evidence of the many enemies of JFK, but offers little suggestion of the coordination between big business, the Mafia, the CIA, the oil industry, Big Steel, the FBI, the military-industrial complex and a number of other opponents of President Kennedy. Additionally it gives no understandable reasons for the ongoing conspiracy denials by the big press organisations of America.",1385683200,4,667,4.955357142857143
5451258,4,B00AMHFPK6,Very Interesting. Has excerpts of the James Files interview as well as interviews with one of the 3 hobos picked up in the rail yard that day.

5451260,5,B00AMHFPK6,"I've bought several videos over the years of questionable source and production which have disappointed me.  As I hadn't heard of this one and truthfully, I wasn't expecting much.

I was actually quite pleased with the way the video was produced, both from a content and presentation standpoint.  It covered a lot of aspects of people and groups who had an interest in stopping JFK and their reasons for doing so.  The materials were presented with sufficient detail and numerous people and sources were used and although at times the plots of the various people involved were complex, this production made them easier to understand and follow.

I've seen several 'what really happened to JFK' documentaries over the years and have never really been convinced of what I was hearing/seeing, as some of them really took me 'off the deep end' in terms of believing some of the materials they were presenting.

While some of the same themes are presented here, it was done in such a way as to more fully document and give credence to what is being said and why these elements were a force in the JFK assassination.  Also included were interviews with various other people along with investigations others have done who have all helped to uncover the truth, as well as numerous articles, documents and other sources that help to tie these themes together.

Another difference in this documentary from all others I have seen in the past was the actual identification of who shot the fatal bullet killing JFK and an explanation of the events leading up to and occurring on that day in Dallas.  When you put it all together, I found this documentary provides a much more plausible and convincing explanation of what happened that day than anything coming out of the Warren Commission.",1380412800,11,1776,4.8349834983498345

5451262,4,B00AMHFPK6,"Found this very interesting and not surpriseing in the fact that not many investigators have delved into this more. I found the interviews about the men ""secretly flown into Dallas to protect and prevent the assassination revealing because I've been researching this event in history since my teenage years, I'm now 56 years old. Lamar Waldron's recent books and declassified documents are finally bringing out what I've thought all along...Mafia, Cuban Exiles, and elements of CIA pulled of the Assassination and the cover up was a result of not wanting those factions of complicity within those groups to expose RFK and JFK's continued plans to get rid of Castro. Unfortunately, with the CIA and Mafia involved in Castro's overthrow since late 1950's into JFK's administration, and RFK's intense crack down on organized crime; it's no wonder how the mafia could infiltrate the secret plans using the same elements they were in bed with. What I want to know is where did the frontal entrance wound to the throat come from. Enjoyed this DVD",1376265600,6,1040,5.017341040462428

This a very informative video, If you really want to know the truth about what happened on the dreadful day in November,before and after the assassination. Form the Bay of pigs all the way through to the present, of facts and drama, this is a much watch for all involved for the truth. It then takes you days before November the 22nd with all the planning with all of the high level people involved to exactly what happened and how it was executed. Interviews with FBI agents Richard Stiller, Zack Shelton Who by the way gives his thumbs up on this production, along with Michael Wacks, CIA's Tosh Plumlee. Along with Forensic Pathologist and Attorney Cyril Wecht, M.D. J.D. who gives a stunning story of the chain of events @ Bethesda Naval hospital. And many others that make this DVD irresistible to all. Wim Dankbaar's research has stunned everyone that has participated in this journey of bring the truth above board. And with the addition of James Files testimony, this DVD is stellar from beginning to end. It will be shocking to view some of the testimony in this new born truth that even at this minute is on going. So I give it a 5 star rating for sure. If you want more you will just have to purchase This Gem, You will be glad that you did...",1375660800,105,1314,4.525210084033613
5451264,5,B00AMHFPK6,"I was looking forward to hearing from normal, ordinary, every-day American people that were there at the time, but I guess that is something that will never happen.

I guess that the title is true in one respect because there is confessions from the grassy knoll, but they come from people involved with the mafia, F.B.I. agents, C.I.A., historical footage of the assassination and the time leading up to the event, and after.

There is some of James Files confession, which was proven by Zack Shelton (a retired F.B.I. Special Agent) to be correct in full, and also evidence by forensic experts, medical people and authors.

This dvd brings forth more evidence on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, so it deserves five stars for being up-front with the evidence. I would like to get a dvd with the full confession of James Files, as I have never heard it in full.

I am in the same opinion as Richard Stilling (retired F.B.I. Special Agent), when he said, ""The Attorney General, should empower a Grand Jury all the legal power of authority of a Grand Jury, to at least satisfy, the juradiction of a verdict. This Grand Jury, should have the authority, to go after whatever information necessary, to gather, what witnesses needed to be interviewed, and charge whatever people, regardless of whatever station in life, with violation of any crime, that have been committed. And basicly let the chips fly where they may.""

Until this is done the answers that millions of people, not only Americans, ask with each new bit of evidence that is presented to them, the truth will never be known. This may never happen as the American Government knows that there is a coverup and wish to protect those involved. When there is silence or suppression of evidence, it can only mean one thing.",1373328000,78,1793,4.7709677419354835
5451265,5,B00AMHFPK6,"This documentary has good production values. The images are sharp and clear. The narration is at an even pitch and pace and highly consistent throughout the film.

I own several other film documentaries regarding President Kennedy's murder, investigation, and the aftermath. Instead of merely telling the audience about agents who were present at the Kennedy autopsy, this documentary interviews one of them, Agent Sibert (Ret.). The retired agent is quite peeved that neither he nor his partner were called as witnesses by the Warren Commission, and that staff attorney Arlen Specter chose to term their famous report of the post mortem, ""mistaken.""

There is a good interview of LtCol Daniel Marvin of US Army Special Forces who was contacted by the CIA through one its agents to take the contract to kill LtCmdr William Pitzer, the US Navy officer who filmed the autopsy and took photos of the entire proceeding, including the spectator gallery during the Kennedy autopsy. The films Pitzer made were at variance with the official version of Kennedy's wounds. Pitzer who was about to retire, had made noises that he had certain films that would reopen the Kennedy assassination investigation. I will let the readers find out what happened to Pitzer and his films. Marvin had declined the CIA contract.

The film does reveal that Oswald had been operating as an intelligence agent either through the DIA or ONI. This piggybacks from the research done by Dr. John Newman (Oswald and the CIA) and discusses how Oswald's intelligence legend was put together.

There are many instances of debunking how certain Warren Commission conclusions do not hold up to scrutiny. Full explanations are presented.

This documentary is worth obtaining and viewing.  I highly recommend this film.",1370131200,172,1779,5.159722222222222

8553767,4,B00AMHFPK6,"By 1979 a House Committee confirmed evidence of more than one shooter and a government cover-up via the Warren Report. Earlier one officer had evidence but he died unexpectedly in 1966.  Oswald had worked for the military and the CIA as a double agent.  Details of Oswalds work in New Orleans is presented.  James Files in prison provides evidence that he was the second gun man on the grassy knoll.  He was involved with the Chicago mob.  Anti-Castro elements, the mob, and the CIA were all angry with JFK for stopping the Cuban invasion.  The planned assassination was to be aborted, but it was too late.  There was also a third shooter identified who actually made the kill shot.  Oswald was set up - the fall guy.  Lots of  important evidence is presented in detail but not summarized very well at the end. Perhaps not possible  The best presentation I have ever seen regarding this tragedy.",1513382400,,895,4.673076923076923
