7999303,5,B0000CG8GO,"This review refers to the Network 7 disc PAL Region 2 set available from Amazon UK.

These 26 penetrating episodes, focusing mainly on military intelligence, (of perhaps 31 in the complete series?) go beyond the usual leaden re-hash of the average war documentary. They are well written, produced and narrated with a lot of knowledge and poise, and it is not surprising that the series was withdrawn for a while out of security considerations  - so rumour has it.

Greatly contributing to the overall authority and credibility of each episode are the many rostrum inserts from acknowledged experts and authors  -  all nicely interlaced with excellent archival footage.

The transfer quality is acceptable to good and reasonably even over the varying quality range of rare film material used. Not up to standard is the packaging, which although compact has the failing that the disc descriptions are printed on the back of the cover sleeve, which means you have to unpack the discs to read it. Could have easily been rectified by printing episode names on the discs themselves or on the back of the box.

Some of the episodes could have been made more objective without the continual (sometimes less than subtle) demonizing of the enemy and the ongoing almost religious-like negative bias that still permeates the entire WWII genre.

Nonetheless, very thought provoking material, worth every pound/dollar.",1349136000,,1404,5.12719298245614
