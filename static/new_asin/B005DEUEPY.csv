8466723,3,B005DEUEPY,"Amy Moore (Eva Amurri Martino) a first year Intern, wakes up in an isolation room and has no idea how she got there or why her hair is so bad. She is being treated by Dr. Sloan (David Harbour) and there are hints this is part of an epidemic. She suspects something is amiss which at an hour into the film, we discover what is going on.

Eva did a solid job in what amounts to a two man play. However, the horror or tension just doesn't grab you. 2 1/2 stars. I recommend ""Sublime"" instead.

8466724,2,B005DEUEPY,"Isolation (Stephen Kay, 2011)

Imagine waking up in a hospital bed, restrained, with no idea of how you got there or what's wrong with you. Everyone you encounterthe orderlies, the inters, the doctor in charge of your caseis frustratingly vague about what's wrong with you, just providing the usual platitudes about how it's all going to be okay and you'll be better soon. Now on top of all that, imagine that you yourself are an intern, and imagine how much that would compound the frustration and bewilderment.

It might actually be possible to glean the entire mystery of Isolation from the few sentences above. I don't believe that is entirely a problem of my own making; the Big Twist here is somewhat predictable, though Kay, probably best known for directing the ill-conceived 2000 remake of Get Carter, does add a few interesting variations to the mix. The patient in this little game is Amy Moore (Saved!'s Eva Amurri Martino), and as the days wear on, all she has to go on is the empty assurances of the hospital staff who wait on her and the occasional sound from the next room over. Problem is that sometimes the sounds from that next room over get a little disconcerting, to the point where she thinks it might be a good idea to try and get out of her bonds and figure out what kind of place she's actually in.

Such a good setup...and then such a trite climax, enough to make me shove this one in the below-average pile despite the first hour of it being solid and actually managing to generate the kind of suspense and mystery that other films of this ilk (Captivity is the obvious parallel here) never managed to achieve. If only Kay had provided a payoff and rich as the film leading up to it. **",1396396800,,1713,4.5372168284789645
8466725,4,B005DEUEPY,"I like a movie that plays with your perceptions and isn't afraid to make the tough decisions.  ISOLATION is a such a movie.

The story centers on Amy Moore, a first-year resident who has woken up in an isolation room with no memory of how she got there.  The doctor in charge of her case, Dr. Sloan, tells her there's been an outbreak, but he won't tell her of what, only that the first-stage symptoms resemble meningitis.  The CDC, he mentions, is working to figure out what's going on.

Her father, a doctor, has been to see her, Sloan tells her, but always when she's sleeping.  The only other person she seems to be awake for, besides Dr. Sloan, is Jake, an orderly.

She slowly regains enough strength to get out of bed without throwing up, and on one of her first trips, she discovers a fellow resident, Paul, is in the next room.  He's got whatever she has, but he's having more trouble fighting it off.

But when she asks Dr. Sloan, he dodges the question, as he's been doing the entire time.  She tries to get information from Jake, but he's visibly nervous and later Dr. Sloan chastises her for upsetting him.  Then she sees the camera in the vent above her bed.

ISOLATION is a slow movie, one of those small, claustrophobic deals with limited settings and cast, and I love those kind of movies.  I liked ISOLATION a lot, I liked taking this journey with Amy, trying to understand what's going on.  Dr. Sloan was totally unlikable, as he was supposed to be, even when the third act came and a pretty important reveal came, one that changed the entire dynamic of everything and showed that not everyone is who you think, not even the ""hero"" of the story.

ISOLATION is a tale with a moral lesson, and that's where I think it runs into its greatest obstacle, because standard operating procedure in a story where we spend so much time sympathizing with one character, the story should end a certain way.  But after the act 3 reveal, we're morally obligated to hope for a different outcome.  I'm still not sure if ISOLATION ended the way it should have, but it was a very brave ending, either way.

Chris Billet (UNREST) wrote the screenplay with Stephen Kay (BOOGEYMAN) directing.  I felt the characterization was pretty one-dimensional, especially in Dr. Sloan, even after his motivation is revealed, and it didn't take long at all to start suspecting everything here might not be on the up and up.  But even after all the cards were on the table, I still felt slightly let down by the ""twist"" that showed not only no sign of originality, but also seemed even less plausible than all of the ""what ifs"" I'd been coming up with as I watched it.  Still, my hat's off for that ending.

Eva Amurri Martino (SAVED!) plays Amy.  I've only seen her in a few other things, always small parts, but she proves here she can carry a movie and play a character we can identify with.  Hopefully she'll make a quick transition to lead roles.

David Harbour (""The Newsroom"") is Dr. Sloan and whether by design or by chance, he was one difficult person to like, even when it seems we're supposed to.  He feels untrustworthy from the start and things don't get better for him.  I know this seems to go against what I said earlier about the characters being one-dimensional, but I stand by that; Sloan is a character we're later supposed to feel for and, in a weird way, want to see succeed, but even then there's just nothing the least bit likable about him.

That being said, I liked ISOLATION.  I think it's a movie that rewards your patience, and one that, while not necessarily playing things quite as close to the chest as it could have, it does have a surprise or two in store for anyone who makes it to the end.  The situation is a horrible one, the sense of utter helplessness in the face of something and someone you don't understand, and being in a place you can't escape from.

I think the moral issue it tackles is an important one, but I'm not convinced this is the movie, nor are these the characters, to tackle it properly.  Still, in the end I enjoyed the movie and can recommend it with no reservations.",1383696000,,4111,4.476510067114094
