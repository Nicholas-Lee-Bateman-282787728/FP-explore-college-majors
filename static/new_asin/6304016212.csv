757930,5,6304016212,"I never read the comics, but when this show aired I was immediately drawn to it. It looked different than any other animated program before or since. So much so that images from the show have been ingrained in my psyche even though I have not seen one frame of the show since it originally aired on MTV in 1996. The writing was better than 99% of the (live action)sitcoms and dramas on television and the character dialogue was more sophisticated. I cared about the characters, which is rare for animated fare. It was an all around great show which deserves to be released on DVD as lesser cult classics have already been.",1206403200,,622,4.513274336283186

I never quite understood what was going on and only got to see a few episodes due to the fact that MTV would play the same shows over and over again.  Still, from time to time, I've wondered how the series ended.  I was just talking to my husband about it the other night and it dawned on me that I should use the internet.  Alas, no dvd, only vhs.  Well, I guess I'll have to buy the videotape, send it to my dad, have him burn it onto a dvd and send it to me here in Iraq.  I really loved the few episodes that I saw and now that I know the full series is available. . . I just have to have it.  It really sucks that MTV hasn't made it available on dvd.

I mean The Maxx was a great series and they have people salivating for a copy of this thing and there is no give. I've been waiting for this DVD for years. There is no way all these people writing reviews could be wrong. No FREAKING WAY!!! I see products on Amazon sell all the time with no review or 1 review and The Maxx has over 50 and it goes unnoticed. Last time i checked we were the consumers and this is what we want, i mean hello that's how it works.

Enough ranting. If you haven't figured it out yet I definantly endorse The Maxx VHS, although I wish they had a DVD version. If the story of the Maxx and Julie never won an award it should for The Most Screwed By It's Corprate Garbage Shoveling Owner Award.

I know it's not legal, but somenone should mass produce DVD copies of this series and give them out for the price of a blank disc (No Profit)

  When I found this listing I was dissapointed to see the running time as 2 hours. My tape of MTV's Oddities marathon comes in at 3 1/2 hours!(with commercials) Each show is 30 mins, with 2 episodes per show, & one double length episode, for 13 episodes. My math gives me a length of 9.23 mins per episode for 2 hours! I thought they usually run at least 11 mins per, but that would still be 143 mins for 13 episodes, not 120.

758008,4,6304016212,"it truly seems like every time MTV nails something, they throw it away.

Of editing in this vhs but there for good reasons.  Not cause of the scenes or anything.  Its the vhs I mean.  For one example there are stuff in the tv debute that weren't in the vhs versan.
Example.
A detective is looking for a villan Mr. Gone hired by the name of HamerHead.
Maxx battles hammerhead in episode 8 I think.
Juile has a conversation with a woman I forgot her name, by the river.
Few flashback scenes of the outback and dialog from Mr. gone was taken out in the VHS tape and made it a bit confusing.
Over all I thought the vhs versan was better cause some stuff were too cartoony and childesh but overall there both good.

758012,5,6304016212,"I'm here to officially announce my heartfelt sentiment that ""The Maxx"" should get a DVD release.  ""The Maxx"" was part of the MTV's Oddities program that ran in the mid-90's before it went BETV and TEENBEAT on us.  Back then, MTV still had a shred of respectability by at least offering shows such as these to people who weren't popular, who weren't listening to the Top 40, and who didn't buy into mass-marketing-mainstream-lifestyle-bullcrap that floods our TVs, radios, and internet today.
I can remember another ""Oddities"" program in particular called ""The Head"" that was just as fun to watch as ""The Maxx"" only not as intelligent or curious.  Anyone who was a fan of this stuff will remember ""Liquid Television"" that gave birth to ""Beavis and Butthead"" and also featured (I believe) ""Aeon Flux"" which is South Parkesque in that one of the leads dies in every episode.  What does this have to do with a DVD release?  Well, obviously MTV doesn't feel that these programs stand up on their own to merit an individual release, so why not just lump all these things together and set them out there?  Call it whatever you like--Liquid Television DVD, Oddities DVD, Mid-90's Culty Animated DVD, whatever.  My point is ""The Maxx.""
To summarize, this is a two-hour long feature adapted from the Sam Kieth comic ""The Maxx"" which follows a purple-and-yellow hero with a roided-out build called Maxx.  He is befriended by Julie Winters who is the victim of a serial rapist known as Mr. Gone.  Mr. Gone is also Maxx's arch-nemesis, or so Maxx thinks.  Then there's Sarah, the girl trying to be a writer, who sees Julie as, I suppose, a quasi-therapist.  Oh, and there's also a mirror-world called ""The Outback,"" also called ""Pangea"" filled with Crabbits, Mountain People, Leaping Slugs, Air-Whales, and gobs and gobs of chattering Isz's.  Once in this world; Julie Winters make the shift to the Leopard Queen, ruler of that world, and Maxx becomes her protector.  Have it figured out yet?
I must have watched this 1,000 times over the years and I'm still not sure if I've got it all put together.  After two degrees in Literature and years of analysis experience I'm flustered.  As far as I've got is this; ""The Maxx"" is about potential realities intruding into perception of actual reality, so much so that the degree in which reality is grasped becomes blurred between what is and what probably is (accounting, by extension, for the name of the ""Isz"").  Grasping and cognating reality is about shuffling through different dimensions, different existences and conflicting outcomes.  For example, when Maxx chases an Isz back from ""The Outback"" into Julie's apartment, he is made small while the Isz remains big.  He still maintains his personae as protector, while the Isz remains white (rather than black) and is prey rather than hunter, even though it would seem because of their size their roles would be reversed.
I won't go on, but I know I could.  There's so much to work through and so many different possibilities that this stuff makes David Lynch seem like a board game, even though I don't care for Lynch.
And even if you're not in ""intellect"" mode, you can still turn the lights off, put this on with a beverage and some chips-n-salsa and just enjoy the writing, because it's very good.",1076630400,60,3289,4.820284697508897

758098,5,6304016212,"The entire series as a whole means less than the sum of the individual episodes unto themselves. Of course it may not make complete sense until you've watched it a few dozen times, but I believe that's the intent of comic books, to infect a certain part of your soul with an intensity that would bore you on a grand scale. To make sense to a certain emotion for a short period of time and let your intellect piece the plot together, one issue at a time.
It is unfortunate that the video leaves out much of what the comic books explain - The Slick Blue Surface, etc. But,..., this is a good video. I only hope someone has the sense to release the full series on DVD some day. Hopefully soon.",1030579200,,690,4.234848484848484

An example and one of my favorites, is where Maxx is small and he dives into the sink and then fights the Black IS with a ladle.  One whole half hour episode with Hammer Head is missing.  Some, maybe most of the lighter moments, which help to counterbalance the more gloomy and serious ones are gone, making the video seem very heavy.  As you watch you can actually see where they cut due to the jumpyness of some of the sequences. It seems like every other second was cut from the series.

758103,5,6304016212,"Let's get this straight--I'm not a comic book junkie. I've never seen 'Ghost in the Shell' or read manga or watched 'Star Trek' and am not anime-obsessed.  The closest I've come to the ""other world"" is a comic convention (in order to research girl-friendly artists), where I was thoroughly disgusted by the creepy loser boys chasing after scantily-clad Xena doppelgangers.  How degrading.
Well, you don't have to be a ""comic-book guy"" to appreciate The Maxx, because I'm your normal urban twentysomething female who was enthralled by The Maxx, the very second I saw it on MTV. Each episode was so insightful, deep, tragically beautiful and narrated. no robotic aliens/violence/slash-em up/gratuitous nudity.  Just a pure, good, deep, sad story.  And it's a story so hard to describe because it is so dreamlike; filled with so many hidden meanings, metaphors, and riddles, you can watch this tape a million times and each time you will see something new.  Maxx and Julie are the main characters, and the story shifts from Real Life to ""The Outback"", an escapist's never-never land; but also riddled with trouble. To describe the summary is pointless,  for The Maxx is subject to your own personal interpretation. Its meaning is so enigmatic, it's part of the surrealist's experience.
All I can say is that the visuals are amazingly moving yet simple, a juxtaposition of well-spaced images, silhouettes, and sounds that draw you into Maxx's world.  Watching this video once is not worth it. It's just too deep, too insightful, too much to absorb. I have had this tape for quite a long time and whenever I want to be visually and mentally stimulated, I pop in the Maxx. I highly recommend you do the same.",1004313600,12,1702,4.93006993006993

Filled with humor, suspense and mystery as we adventure with The Maxx on his way to discovering who he truly is, where he came from, and how everyone else fits into his subconcious fantasy world.  It's two hours of confusion and boucing back and forth between the real world and The Maxx's subconcious all coming down to an ending that makes you realize just how easy it can be to cross that fine line between genius and insanity.",994291200,2,693,4.390625

The Maxx didn't belong on Mtv, and after only one season, it was canned. This is the only draw back to the video. With such a great story, and great cliffhanger, you forget that there is only one season, and noone can answer the  BIG question at the end. That shouldn't stop you from buying this though.

It's a shame that these ""cartoons for adults"" don't get more respect; this is a very innovative, artistic, and entertaining presentation.
If you liked the comics, you definitely won't be disappointed with this.
If you're looking for a light-hearted, funny cartoon with singing lobsters and bunnies, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a dark, twisted story that will reel you in and leave you wishing for more, buy this today.",978739200,6,791,4.954887218045113

  The artwork was creative and though provoking, with just enough comic relief to make this show less dark and depressing.  After watching a few episodes I went out and bought the graphic novel and discovered a it was based on a comic book series from Image comics.  The comics are a must read, 'specially the issue on the 'creation' of Mr. Gone.  I think that after you read these  comics, you'll have a greater love for this series.

758185,5,6304016212,"When I first stumbled upon this series a few years ago, while flipping past MTV, I was unsure of what to expect. I mean, MTV is not exactly a bastion of intellectual brilliance, nor a standard-setter in terms of  quality television programming. This is, after all, the same cable station  that tortures us with tripe like ""The Real World"".
Alas, The  Maxx intruiged. My wife and I were so interested, in fact, we promptly  purchased the video cassette not long after catching a snippet of The Maxx  on television. Once exposed to the full-length drama that is The Maxx, my  wife and I could only turn to each other and say: W-O-W!
To call this  movie both deep and complex is the understatement of the year. I had to  watch it a few times to really get my hands around the characters and the  plot. It simultaneously takes you on a tour of a Rogues Gallery of the  human soul, while giving us characters that are very flawed and altogether  heart-wrenching. Julie, The Maxx, Sarah, Mr. Gone, each one of them is a  richly-drawn portrait. They amuse, annoy, invite, provoke, and otherwise  engage the viewer.
It's not often that American animation reaches heights  like this. For the most part, American animation is cutesy, watered-down,  moralistic,and sickeningly huggable. Either that, or it's moronically  violent and so utterly devoid of plot that you wonder what shreds of  so-called script the animators had to go on in the first place.
Then  comes The Maxx, a film that makes you love animation all over again. A  diamond in the rough, The Maxx is a priceless gem! I highly, highly  recommend this film for anyone who wants to reawaken their otherwise dulled  taste in American animated film, or just films in general.",959644800,29,1726,4.744107744107744
758295,5,6304016212,"Sam keith, the creator of the Maxx has done an amazing job in translating the story of the Maxx from comic book to animation.  The color scheme is mezmerizing and the story follows the original comic book series almost  perfectly. For those unfamiliar with the Maxx, it isn't kiddie stuff. It  deals with what trauma does to people and how they react to it and deal  with their problems.  That is only to sum up the story briefly as a  concept. There is also a barrage of action and flawless execution of the  animation.  This series was first run on MTV.  It's one tape I have no  regrets about adding to my collection.  I reccomend it highly to all manga  fans. Although it isn't Manga, it holds it's own among the greats such as  Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Ninja Scroll.  Definately a must have",953510400,4,801,4.397260273972603
758296,5,6304016212,"The Maxx is one of the most enchanting, awe inspiring movies I have ever seen. The story draws you in and the characters are truly unique, intense and colorful and really move you, there is no one like The Maxx and Julie.  I have even created my screen name after the movie; MaxxandJulie. If you  want to see an all-time great, watch this movie!",952041600,,345,4.375
758297,5,6304016212,"You are now a prisoner of The Maxx.  Buying this film is a 2 hour sentencing of insanity. I promise you will never fully escape the twists and turns, the questioning, oh, the questioning. What is real, what is not.  This film truly takes you on a journey into some ones brain who isn't  quite right. Would someone please find creator Simon Keith and lock him  away.  Not only becasue he's crazy, but so that we will know where to look  for his next masterpiece.",949795200,,461,4.364705882352941

758299,5,6304016212,"Dark and twisted, this movie really does make you think.  It might be a good thing that this hasn't been made into a live-action movie yet, because it would lose it's charm.  Who didn't find it funny, though, when Maxx was  shrunk and fought the large Iz, tying it to the coffee table after  defeating it?  This movie kicks major butt...buy it now.",932860800,,348,4.4603174603174605
758300,5,6304016212,The Maxx brings many things together for me in its symbolic city and outback dimensions.  It is a true examination of the human spirit with all of its colors and complexities.  Sometimes we don't speak or convey our  deepest feelings to one another or even to ourselves -- The Maxx teaches us  how.,930009600,,298,4.566037735849057
7858946,5,6304016212,I absolutely love this show - I saw it a long time ago late night on MTV and I was really worried that I wouldn't be able to find it. I've never read the comic but I enjoy the animated series a lot.,1505001600,,198,3.627906976744186

7858948,5,6304016212,"This is my favorite comic of all time. It's about a hobo with multiple personality disorder. In his normal person mental state, Maxx sees a therapist from time to time in the city, but when he has a schizoid episode he sees the city as a fictional land called ""The Outback"", complete with fictional creatures. The therapist becomes his ""jungle queen"" but she has her own story.",1420070400,,377,4.641791044776119
7858949,4,6304016212,"Thankfully you can now get this one of a kind series on a manufacture on demand basis through Amazon. Before that this was really your only option. Unfortunately it had the low-def look of all VHS plus was missing an episode. That said, it was a semi-disposable episode anyways and that doesn't take away from the glory of the rest of this series.",1379462400,,347,4.523809523809524

7858951,4,6304016212,"As a VHS, I expected it to be somewhat worn, especially for how old this series is. The box was of course a little worse for wear, and you can tell the tape has been played multiple times. What matters most is how it plays, and it's all I hoped for! I still haven't watched the whole thing, so I hope I'm not jinxing myself, but so far so good!!! :)",1259366400,,349,3.9295774647887325
7858952,5,6304016212,"I watched this movie after not having seen it since the mid nineties. I have to tell you this, it was extremely imaginative and well written.

I would highly recommend anything written by this person. As far as the quality of the product I received, the video was excellent. This tape probably sat in a video store for the majority of its life unwatched which was my luck and a loss to anybody who didn't rent it. Warning: Do NOT take cough medicine before watching, okay?",1258502400,,472,4.488372093023256
7858953,5,6304016212,"A superb piece of animation magic. This sorid tale sets a solid foundation and when coupled with quality graphic cartooning the result is sublime. I knew The Maxx had this covered when it was first released, and yet coming back to it after all these years has not diluted any of it's original potency. In fact it has only gotten better.",1250899200,,336,4.524590163934426
7858954,5,6304016212,"I scooped up Aeon Flux a few years back and figured The Maxx would be well on it's way to DVD.....now I am hoping for Blu-Ray. My god, how long do we have to wait for this? It was one of the most interesting, surreal and beautiful animations on TV.
Until they decide to release tangible copies you can watch the episodes on MTV online.",1247097600,,335,4.1692307692307695
7858955,5,6304016212,"Great show. I've had the VHS for years.
Clever, witty, funny, addictive story, great dialogue, deep characters, very heady, and all around well written with sleek & stylish animation that was very cutting-edge for its day. This is one of the great shows from an era when MTV was still creative & a channel worth watching.

I very much hope they'll release a DVD of this show. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it.",1245456000,,406,4.561643835616438
