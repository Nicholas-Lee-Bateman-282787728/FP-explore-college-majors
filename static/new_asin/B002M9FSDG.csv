3951968,2,B002M9FSDG,"Brittany Murphy is Alice, a screenwriter moving to an old, abandoned house in order to finish her work. Though her concerned friend Rebecca (Tammy Blanchard) doesn't seem to like the idea, Alice intends to live in this lonely place alone for a week. Then a string of creepy incidents happens to her. Moreover, Alice discovers a video camera and lots of tapes in the house, recording the life of a loving couple Lucy (Thora Birch) and David (Marc Blucas).

Umm, this sounds a bit familiar, doesn't it? ""Deadline"" is not very scary with clichd scare tactics (like shadows moving across the screen) and a pretty predictable storyline. One unique narrative device is the videotapes that connect the two threads of stories, one about Brittany Murphy's Alice and the other about Thora Birch's Lucy. The supernatural setting and the subsequent interaction between the past and the present might have worked with more interesting characters we can relate to, and more smooth and convincing character development.

The production design of the creepy house is decent, and so are the performances from the leading ladies Murphy and Birch, but the concept of ""documenting"" someone's own behaviors is stretched too far, and it begins to look ridiculous in the second half of the film.

I like Brittany Murphy, who tragically passed away last year, and Thora Birch, who was so good in ""Ghost World."" My two stars go to these players who deserve a better movie.",1267747200,3,1447,4.971074380165289

3951970,1,B002M9FSDG,"Badly written and utterly predictable. Pet peeve: promotional artwork gives away too much (and considering how poor Brittany Murphy met her end, is in spectacular bad taste as well).

I'm still trying to figure out the point to this lame movie which builds the mood up just to let the viewer down.  Poor Brittany, she should have passed up this film; her horrible lip job combined with her sickly look was a disservice to her.",1264464000,6,400,4.391891891891892
3951972,5,B002M9FSDG,"I had to give one of Brittany Murphy's last movies a 5 star rating. However, it really was great for a smaller budget film if you like thriller movies. Brittany's performance reminds us even though we haven't seen her in several years on film she's still got it. No one plays paranoid, scared, and on the edge quite like her (Don't Say A Word.) Some may find the movie a little slow, but I found it totally creepy. The twist at the end is great for any Lost fan who likes shows or movies that make you think a little. Thora Birch recieves an honorable mention as well. I haven't seen her since ""Now & Then"" years ago.",1263686400,7,617,4.237288135593221

3951974,4,B002M9FSDG,"***** spoiler alert (maybe)******

Whoever called this a man-hating movie didn't watch it through to the end (or else didn't understand it). It is really more of a psychological thriller about sanity and the blending of reality and imagination. I was unsure until the very end what was really going on (which makes me happy as so many movies are too easy to see through). I found it spooky and interesting. I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil it for others who like having to figure things out.....",1260748800,12,508,4.521739130434782
3951975,3,B002M9FSDG,"""Deadline"" is a dark atmospheric thriller, recalling ""Skeleton Key"" and ""A Haunting."" Brittany Murphy plays a somewhat young and out-of-sorts artist who moves into a large, empty house with a dark creepy past. She moves there alone, conveniently, to escape a past abusive boyfriend.

ALl goes well for a few hours, then strange noises begin to happen. Objects move about with no explanation. Video footage of the young couple who once lived in the house is found by Murphy in the attic of the house. It is eventually revealed in flashbacks that there was some sinister activities in the house in the years that had passed. Surprise!! The 'twist' in the end is not much of a twist at all, and Murphy looks spaced out and dazed throughout the film (kind of how she looked in ""Don't say a Word,"" only a decade or so older.) Needless to say, this role is no stretch for Murphy.

Thora Birch is creepy and believable as the ghost woman in the flashbacks, and her performance creates an eerie, tense mood that make the film a worthwhile rental for fans of this genre, but not much more.",1260144000,41,1080,4.590673575129534

3951991,2,B002M9FSDG,"Cliff notes version: An emotionally wounded writer named Alice,(Murphy) decides to stay in a large, Victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere (of course.) to work on her latest book after recently being released from a mental institution. Naturally, she insists on being left alone. (Of course.) Odd events begin to grab her attention when she happens upon a video camera and its film contents. Is this home in the middle of nowhere already occupied.......by the undead?
  Now to the bones of the movie:
What a mess! Messy script. Messy characters with lack of any kind of development. Messy ending. The scariest thing about this movie is how Brittany Murphy floats through the entire film with perpetual ""duck lips"" since she never closes her mouth, wide, unblinking eyes and jerky movements. She genuinely looks frail and terrible, which would make sense since, sadly, this was to be her last film. Her character could have been played by an animatronic robot since there is very little dialogue or any other ""emotion"" other than the, ""I'm-perpetually-mouth-breathing-and-looking-alarmed-for-no-reason-whatsoever"" type of 'acting'. The script is bare, the acting is lackluster and there is no character development at all, this makes me not care about what happens to any of the them throughout the movie. None of the characters are likable. The ending will leave you scratching your head and cursing at the TV because it is so confusing and ambiguous. In conclusion, there is really nothing ""artful"" or ""clever"" about this film and if I didn't know any better, I would have thought I was watching a Lifetime movie.",1461888000,,1618,5.125

3951995,4,B002M9FSDG,"This is an interesting psychological murder mystery with just the right light touch of the supernatural to provide a subtle piquant character to the storyline.

The various elements of the script are realistically portrayed and spares no effort in conveying the full weight of emotional impact upon the viewer.

The self inflicted psychological onslaught is merciless and perhaps even dangerous, but the debate of the therapeutic efficacies of such an approach to emotional purging and self healing is better left to professionals.

To be honest, our hearing is not all up to snuff and because this has no closed captions...well, we've ways of getting round it, and will most certainly watch again to get the full audio, but just by eye alone the movie is a finished and fine work of horror cinema, and a tribute to more than one great acting talent. And it's one of those stories where it's all so visual that you really don't feel you're missing out on much. Several times I paused again and again to get the effect of slow motion on my Amazon Instant stream, particularly in the hugely symbolic scenes to do with water and drowning.

Something was wrong with her in this film. She looks drugged. There is a scene where her character falls asleep, with her head resting on a table. We see a 'ghost' walk behind her. The action called for Brittany to snap awake, with a startled gasp. But as you watch this moment in the film, it looks off, and this is because Brittany's eyes are glazed and she is unable to open them wide in surprise. She makes the gasp and quickly lifts her head, as directed, but she is simply too out of it to carry the action through to her eyes. It saddens me that this once amazing young star is forever caught on film in this sort of stupor.

I don't know how it ends, I'll admit that, but the sad part is I'm not even interested enough in the characters to care what happened to them.

The situations seem very contrived and caused me to lose interest in their dilemma and any possible outcome. I suggest you watch this one before you buy it.

3952022,4,B002M9FSDG,"At some point in time, every word or phrase that has the word ""dead"" in it will have a dozen horror movies built around it. Alice (Brittany Murphy) is a writer and has a ""deadline."" Her ex-bf is getting out of prison and she is afraid of him. Her slime ball producer allows her the use of a seclude house so she can be alone and write. Her girlfriend Becky (Tammy Blanchard) takes her out to the big house and strands her there for a week, at Alice's request.

This is a good old fashion haunted house with creaky doors (no 3 in 1 Oil) that move themselves, dripping faucets, faint screams, and things that go bump in the night. The camera angles are excellent and give one that voyeuristic, being watched look, couple with the noises they create a haunted atmosphere. The gorgeous Brittany looks defeated and distraught.

Through some unusual circumstances Brittany finds and views video left by the former occupants of the home, David (Marc Blucas) and Lucy (Thora Birch) a couple on the verge of breaking up. Lucy is pregnant. David has a video camera and is obsessive with it to the point where it bothers Lucy. Alice, who is on medication for some unknown reason, is also a bit obsessive with her camera. Good haunted house story. Kudos Brittany, wish you were here.

3952023,5,B002M9FSDG,"Our Beloved Brittany Murphy,  Did you know that New Orleans offers a haunted plantations tour?  I like to think this was why an old Victorian mansion in Louisiana was chosen for you to showcase your immense acting talent in the horror genre.  The house and you make ""Deadline"" highly suspenseful.

I was delighted to see your friend and costar from ""The Ramen Girl"", Tammy Blanchard.  Will there be more collaborations?  Tammy and you exhibit a close and warm friendship during the time she drives you to the Victorian house and leaves you there alone after a tour of the house.

You convincingly convey you are a screenwriter named Alice.  You are glad a producer friend has given you use of the house.  You want to spend time alone working on your script  We learn you have to deal with some emotional trauma from a past boyfriend named Ben. We find out on your first night alone that you also have to deal with a haunted house.

Even though you are alone you manage to keep us glued to the screen.  Scary things and noises convince us you are not alone in the house.  You convey vulnerability and we become more and more concerned something is going to happen to you.  It seems the ghost character played by Thora Birch keeps trying to communicate with you.  On a phone call with Tammy, Your decision to remain in the creepy house to work and figure out what is going on is believable.

You continue to rivet us to the screen.  Your acting is intensely contemplative and responsive.  Right up to the end we are concerned for Thora's life and your life.  This reminded me of the dramatic acting by Marilyn Monroe in the melodrama ""Niagara"" , which she starred in at the age of 27 in 1953

This is a creative and original look at relationships and dealing with emotional stress.  I am proud of you for starring in this role in ""Deadline"".",1322438400,4,1839,4.495468277945619

3952026,1,B002M9FSDG,"""Deadline"" is a really bad movie. One of the last films of Brittany Murphy's career really sucked. One thing I noticed about this movie is that she looked like a drug addict or a really sick person in it, so you could tell that she was in bad health. The plotline was pretty good and it seems like a movie that would have a couple good scares, but it's really nothing. You get excited for nothing. It's a straight-to-DVD movie, so you can't really expect anything great in the first place, but this really just wasn't good. Nothing really creepy happens until about 30 minutes, and the scares are so minimal, and not in a good way. It might as well be a PG movie. The plotline suddenly grows boring as the story of the couple who used to live there climaxes. Near the end, you're basically still bored because it becomes really predictable and the ending confused me for a bit after I saw it, although I did get the whole ending later. You have to think about it a bit afterwards, and that's the only good thing about. Altogether, you should skip ""Deadline"".",1301529600,2,1058,4.430769230769231

The use of video-cameras in movies is getting tiresome and overdone. Overall, a disappointing film.",1279152000,2,454,5.536231884057971
3952029,5,B002M9FSDG,"First off I'd like to say that the only reason I purchased this movie is because Brittany Murphy is in it. I've been a fan of Brittany's since ""Don't Say A Word,"" ""Just Married,"" ""Uptown Girls,"" and ""Little Black Book"" and after she died, I decided to watch all over her other movies and am very glad I did. Either you think she is utterly sexy, enthralling, vivacious, strong yet vulnerable, genuine, and irresistible or you don't. It's such a shame that she died. In this movie you really start to see her growing into 30-something-year-old, more mature, ""womanly"" roles as opposed to the younger slapstick or strung-out roles that marked most of her career. I would have loved to have seen her in more serious dramas as she got older (Falling Sky was an early indication of the type of serious, mature drama she was capable of even though she was only 20 to 21 years old in that film).

As far as ""Deadline"" is concerned, first, I think most people are judging this from the perspective of a big-budget Hollywood production. It was a low-budget independent, art house movie by First Look Studio and should be viewed and judged with that in mind. Second, this movie is best viewed late at night with all the lights turned off - it's very much an atmospheric movie. Third, the movie is much better on second viewing. Aside from the enjoyment of watching the gorgeous and haunting Brittany Murphy, the film didn't really click or appeal to me on first viewing. However, I absolutely loved it on second and subsequent viewings. If you are a fan of Brittany Murphy and want to own one of her last works and/or are a fan of the old-fashioned ""haunted house"" or ""mysterious thrillers with a twist that make you think"" films that Alfred Hitchcock perfected than you should definitely add this blu-ray to your collection. It's a very well-done, non-Hollywood bluster, classy film, IMHO. The pace and cinematography are outstanding and it's great to pop in the player when you want to watch a nice, subtle thriller with friends or family who haven't seen one in a while or just miss the fabulous, late Brittany Murphy. RIP, gorgeous - you'll always be missed.",1277078400,5,2152,4.678100263852243
3952030,5,B002M9FSDG,"For one thing, this must have been one of Brittany Murphy's last movies (and in knowing that, she appears to be very ill.) There is a memorable scene where she looks through a glass door and pauses for a moment in closing it, and there is just this very final, haunting look on her face. If you like spooky, morbid, suspenseful thrillers that are more about making you jump than grossing you out with blood and gore, you will love this movie! An author, Alice goes to stay at an old house for one week to write. Her friend, Rebecca drives Alice to the house and takes the car back with her. Later, Rebecca lets Alice know that her violent ex-boyfriend, Ben is out of jail and may be looking for her. Alice begins hearing noises in the house and comes across some videotapes in the attic of a disturbed couple (Lucy and David.) She becomes absorbed in their story. When she finds the last tape and Rebecca tells her that Lucy and David were never found and are considered missing, Alice suddenly realizes that one of them could be in the house. The ending is a bunch of twists and turns that are open to interpretation. Is this all in Alice's mind or did someone (other than Ben) try to kill her? Lucy's story and Alice's parallel each other so closely. Did Alice just create the very real characters of David and Lucy for her next novel? Rebecca and the audience are left wondering. This type of movie reminded me a lot of What Lies Beneath. But the ending is more in the style of Alfred Hitchcock. The background music is exceptional and really pulls you into the story.",1272153600,52,1571,4.4206896551724135
3952031,3,B002M9FSDG,"I didn't go into this movie expecting much considering the cover and it seemed the same as a million other ghost movies I have seen in the past 10 years. Throughout viewing this movie I was dissappointed and entralled.

Brittany Murphy plays as a screenwriter who has just moved into a creepy, old mansion to complete her new script. The movie is filled with odd sounds and bumps in the night, which was glorified in the original Shirley Jackson classic, ""The Haunting"".

About less than midway in the film Murphy finds a collection of home videos of the previous owners. Of course she watches her find and becomes obsessed. On tape is the documentation of a disgruntled married couple, played by Thora Birch and Marc Blucas. Quickly, she discovers there are frightening similarities between Thora and herself. Brittany discovers later that Thora is murdered and her ghost still haunts the estate.

At first, this movie moves like an Asian horror film, its creepy and almost poetic with its style, however, theres only one problem. There is a scene where Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is playing, Murphy follows the music and sees dead Thora Birch playing the piano, instead of Birch slowly turning to face Murphy the scene becomes loud and obnoxious with poor cgi effects. The result was a cheap scare that lacked a jump. In this one specific scene I have listed two facts that annoyed me. 1. The director went for a poor scare tactic vs. the ghost slowly turning and facing Murphy. 2. PLEASE FORGET CGI WHEN SOMETHING IS SIMPLE *as in Thora's deathly makeup* BE CREATIVE AND USE OLD SCHOOL EFECTS! If Dick Smith could shock millions with makeup and latex what is stopping Hollywood now?

Instead of giving up on the movie, I watched it till the end and the twist was redeeming. I snagged this in the $5 bend at Walmart and feel it was worth that amount of money. This movie is rated R, which I believe is a bogus rating, this is clearly no worse than a PG-13 rated film. This movie is without gore or any major or minor scare factors, but it is an interesting watch. Out of a scale of 1 to 10, I rate it a 6 1/2. The only thing that prevented the movie from reaching a higher number is the Moonlight Sonata scene that frustrated me.",1271203200,15,2233,4.5889724310776945
3952032,2,B002M9FSDG,"This was a watchable movie that had kind of an interesting idea, but turned to overused plot devices and a 'twist' at the end that has been used numerous times already.  Brittany Murphy seemed like a zombie in this movie.  Thora Birch did a nice job as the ghost wife. The entire film was slow and just seemed to drag and the continued use of the hand held video camera is getting so overused it is becoming a joke.  Who really documents stuff like that anyway?  I read another reviewer saying that Thora Birch does a lot of 'man hater' movies.  This wasn't a man hater movie.  Yes, there was a man in it who you were expected to dislike, but I don't think they tried to portray him as the 'everyman.'  I think the best part of this movie for me was spotting the glaring inconsistency with continuity.  From the time Thora Birch is tied to a chair to the time she gets into the tub to the time she gets out, she manages to put on an article of clothing from the chair to the tub then remove it before getting out of the tub. Anyway, the bottom line is that I did not care for this film but it's not the worst movie I've ever seen.  Some of the plot devices are old but if you haven't seen a lot of movies they could pass as original and entertaining.  This is for sure not one I would buy.",1269388800,6,1289,4.099601593625498

8373615,5,B002M9FSDG,"Deadline is my opinion a almost a semi Alfred Hitchcock reminiscent modern-day be laying film , with modern day elements. This is one of the last three films that BrittanyMurphy started. My opinion and overall from what I have seen so far with reviews from bands I had don't really go by reviewers anymore, meaning film review words. Because it's the bad stuff by the movies or at least Rento . I however bought it :-) anyways , DeadAlive is a very good content house/found footage movie . That's a great way of describing it . It's about a young woman who gets dropped off by her female friend to a house that she rented to write her next book. So she is staying there during the course of the summer to work on her next novel . Soon as her friend leaves things start to get eerie and go awry. As she is in Abilene the addicts or maybe a's separate from from her own she finds a camcorder which sparks inspiration for her next book and realizes that something terrible happened to the woman that lived there before when ultimately the footage shows the husband most likely murdered his wife played by Dora Birch. The husband just played by Mark Blucas, whom I grew up with as a preteen/teenager with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, he was on Jay and silent Bob and several other TV shows throughout my teenage years and now has a show on TNT . An amazing actor along with Thora Birch and the late exceptional Brittan yMurphy.. As BrittanyMurphy's character uncovers more secrets the house seems to be haunted and things get more intense for her while writing her novel . Will she meet her deadline you'll have to rent or buy the movie for 799 to find out. I highly recommend this movie it is one of my all-time favorites with her. I originally bought this packing day and it came out around 2010. And loves it though I lost my DVD when moving to a new apartment and when her ""last film "" something wicked was released I saw it was on sale on Amazon extremely cheap and no longer $20 so I jumped on that immediately. It is a good movie I like some of her last films like "" man ""which was labeled her last film so I don't know what the deal is with ""SomethingWicked"", because that does seem to be a finalized I did watch it all the way through. And that film does seem to be a major project film I like abandoning which obviously is a direct to DVD movie that probably would've aired on TNT or sci-fi one of those type of channels. However I do consider things her last film because they were executed much better I completely think it's worth a five-star rating extremely well done kept me on the edge of my seat and when you're in a wheelchair that means you can fall out and not get back again LOL five stars great cast great.",1502496000,,2722,4.297665369649805

8373618,3,B002M9FSDG,"This movie had its moments...

A writer on a deadline secludes herself at an old house to finish her script.  She's also hiding out from her abusive boyfriend, just released from jail after trying to drown her and causing the death of their unborn child. As soon as she's alone in the house, she begins to hear voices, cries, and weird noises.  She also finds a box of videos in the attic which depict the lives of the young couple (David and Lucy) owning the house, and there the plot thickens...

This is a very atmospheric film but after a while, it got tiring to hear ominous music when Alice approached a closed door or opened a box. Warning the audience beforehand is good only for so long. There's a great deal of symbolism in the continued close-ups of the bathtub and the dripping water, as well as the sounds of it echoing through the house.

Though it's expected, the threat from the boyfriend never comes about and it's a little too convenient that he calls and apologizes remorsefully for his actions, then is out of her life forever...a bit of a limp exit after the big build-up.  That leaves only the things going bump in the house for Alice to fight.

Eventually, however, it all boils down to: Is this a psychotic break spiraling into delusion and madness or are there really ghosts in the house determined via the video tapes to play our their tragedy again and again while dragging the onlookers into it?

While this is spooky, suspense-building, and atmospheric, the story is a cliche from beginning to end. The aforementioned warning music, as well as the continued close-ups of Alice, looking half-dazed and wide-eyed with terror get to be somewhat tiring. That can only go so far, and the ending...

Four stars for mood, no stars for the way this movie finishes (or doesn't) as the case may be.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1492819200,,1920,4.587719298245614
