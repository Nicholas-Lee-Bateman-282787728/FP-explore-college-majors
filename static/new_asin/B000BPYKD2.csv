8090777,1,B000BPYKD2,"for such a pro vocal coach - roger could have used someone on the video-side with a little more skill-and vision on how to present his tips- maybe this kind kind of coaching can only be done in person -i don't know... and showing little ""roger's the best"" testimonials in a product i've already purchased is decidedly lame.",1233878400,2,323,4.586206896551724
8090778,5,B000BPYKD2,"I highly recommend this DVD. I have a small project recording studio where I love to write and record and after so many years of singing/recording without technique, this DVD is really stearing me in the right direction. I'm only into the third excercise and notice a huge difference. I can sing longer without going horse, infact I haven't gone horse yet. My tone is cleaner and I don't strain to sing.  So far I've worked on how jaw placement opens the air way, where the swallowing muscles should not be and how not to use your larynx but instead use only air and vocal folds when singing.  When studing the DVD, one has to really try and understand what Roger is saying, rewind and understand what is being taught before moving on, it really works.  I can't wait to see my results after really mastering all the exercises.",1204675200,10,826,4.530201342281879
8090779,5,B000BPYKD2,"I love this product!  I've been taking vocal lessons for several years and I've had great instructors.  However, with this product I was finally able to finally ""FEEL"" the place (channel) where my voice should flow.  If my voice goes flat or falls to the back of my throat, I don't experience insecurity or worry; I can relax, take a deep breath and feel good that I now know how to quickly move it back to its rightful place.  I'm confident with continous practice, it will occur effortlessly.",1167782400,4,494,4.579545454545454
