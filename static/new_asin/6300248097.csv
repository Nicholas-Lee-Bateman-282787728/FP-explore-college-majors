268007,2,6300248097,"Sequel to the somewhat-thrilling ""Romancing the Stone"", this movie was more entertainment than adventure tale.  It starts off well  enough, with another of Joan Wilder's romantic tales, and segues to  real-life where Joan and Jack are taking the cruise they promised each  other at the end of ""Romancing the Stone"".  From there the tale  is fairly predicatable, and there are some action shots that will make you  groan (the scene with the jet fighter is a particular groaner), but there  are enough highlights to make the effort worthwhile.  Danny DeVitto is  terrific in this film and provides some much-needed comic relief in just  the right spots.",966211200,2,651,5.047169811320755

268383,3,6300248097,"1985 saw the rather rushed sequel to Romancing the Stone with Kathleen Turner, Michael Douglas and Danny Devito returning once again to the big screen as their original characters of Joan, Jack and Ralph on another adventure.  It has been six months since their adventures in Columbia, and Jack and Joan have been sailing the high seas all over the world aboard their boat, the Angeline (named after Joan's heroine in her romance novels), which Jack purchased after selling the emerald El Corazon from their first adventure.  Joan has been suffering from writer's block and longs to head back to New York, while Jack is perfectly content to live their exotic, jet set lifestyle of great parties and good times.  A tension has been building between them, although it's not referenced enough until a certain moment early in the film, when the audience realizes that they are not as happy as they should be (although Jack shows his anger when he is referred to at a party hosted in Joan's honor as Mr. Wilder).  Joan meets a flamboyant Arab named Omar who invites her to come to his fictional country in Africa to write a piece on him, praising him as the new leader of the nation.  Joan, wanting to make a change from writing romantic fiction, accepts the offer and leaves.  Jack is reunited with Ralph, angry and seeking revenge for his incarceration following the Columbia kidnapping, and meets a wild eyed Arab who earlier attempt on Omar's life was not successful named Tarak.  Tarak informs Jack of Omar's true intentions as a dictator and begs him to help him and his people free The Jewel, Al-Julhara, which Omar has possession of.  Jack and Ralph agree and travel to Africa with Tarak who has them join in on his freewheeling, circus antic people who are out to free The Jewel from Omar's prison.  Joan discovers after a few days that Omar is not the charming benevolent he came off as, but rather an evil dictator who is looking to create an image of himself as the false redeemer to the people of the nation.  And he hires an English sound and lighting tech to create such an image to the simple people of his nation that we would otherwise be used to seeing at your average stadium rock concert.

While this had a healthy turn at the box office, critics were not as kind to this sequel as they were to Romancing the Stone.  There are holes in the plot, to be sure, and you get a sense that the three leads agreed to do this movie out of some kind of contractual obligation rather than a legitimate want to do another.  Danny Devito has some great moments as Ralph, Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner's chemistry is still in action, and Joan has even become a bit braver to take risks thanks to her relationship with Jack.  The story is not as fluid as one would like it to be, Joan and Jack's chemistry is just as good as it was in the original, but the rough patch that they seemed to have was solved rather quickly with the addition of their reuniting.  There are few words of criticism.  In fact, the addition of Avner Eisenberg is a rather refreshing new spin on the tale.  They are not after a physical treasure this time like they thought they were, but Joe is, in fact, The Jewel.  He's a holy man and The Jewel is his religious title.  He's a bit underused as his acrobatics and clown antics are a lot of fun and he is obviously having fun with it.  He is, after all, Avner the Eccentric, and makes a career out of his being a known clown (Google it).  Unfortunately, this killed off the franchise and I would have liked to have seen Joan and Jack's later life as a married couple.  There was talk for their to be a third movie with them on some kind of adventure with their kids, but it never came to fruition.  And, quite honestly, what woman wouldn't want the handsome prince to come in and rescue her once in a while, which Jack will inevitably do for Joan when she is facing her final conflict with Omar.  Another good movie for a rainy afternoon.",1454284800,,3970,4.459197786998617

Guy is mad at lady, but will save her for the sake of his selfish desire for wealth; finds that he was glad to save her, anyway.  Golly.  I thought for sure that the lady was going to grow old in captivity, never to see again the man that she loved!  (I'm rolling my eyes, now.)

I certainly do NOT like the advertising for Sufism.  The symbolism of Islam's defeat of the Roman Empire is all but explicit.  A western puppet, with his own, personal F-16, has taken over Egypt.  He even stages a propaganda show where he is a phoenix rising from the flames, but then the good guys get into the control booth and start jerking the joystick this way and that, causing the phoenix to tumble.  Finally, the ""Jewel,"" the Sufi, makes his innocent and miraculous reappearance from captivity as the savior of his people.  Yes, there is preaching in this movie, so the agenda is real.",1427760000,,1157,4.355140186915888

268774,2,6300248097,"The Jewel of the Nile is a 1985 action-adventure romantic comedy. and a sequel to the 1984 film Romancing the Stone, with Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito reprising their roles. Directed by Lewis Teague, the film sends its characters off on a new adventure in a fictional Afrcan desert, in an effort to find the precious ""Jewel of the Nile."" Despite being a box office success, it was a disappointment in critical reviews.

The introduction of The Jewel of the Nile's level of intrigue is bijou and there are many decent action scenes(especially for an 80's flick) further into the Film. Closer to the end things get really awkward but are still entertaining,but really long drawn out semi-interesting action scenes get really redundant  before and during the final acts and there are no twists after the first half hour.

The Cast is still good,especially Danny Devito this time around,but Michael Douglas and kathleen Turner are not giving much to do here. Kathleen Turner does not get a chance to display her versatility as much as the last Film in this series and Michael Douglas does not come off as burly as the last Film.

I must commend the Film for the conflicts it presents the main characters Joan and Jack in the beginning of the Film,they develop well in this Film,although their paths are far more predictable this time around. Ralph is a stand out character in this film as he walks a thin line between what we expect him to do.

All in all the Film drastically lacks the charm of the original and the Plot is evidently foreseeable,while both Films are equally as funny,this Film is not as ornate or imaginative. Douglas and Turners chemistry is not that bad here and it is better than the overall plot,but overall the Film is not as good as the first one",1412294400,5,1788,4.699680511182109

Yes it's a fun movie, but I'm at the age where I notice the quiet racism/stereotypes placed in our media and it's hard not to notice once you do in this movie. There were a lot of little things I let slide but it just keeps compounding.  For instance we start in Egypt, everybody looks light skinned middle eastern (except for our white protagonist with dark make-up on of course), there's no modern technology or clothing, and when we FINALLY meet some black people half way into the movie they're an ""indigenous tribe"" and a big black man wants to wrestle Michael Douglas so he can ""claim"" Michael's gf.  I couldn't watch anymore after this it was hurting my heart too much.

But yea, if they do this movie and actually cast someone from, at least, the continent of Africa for the main Egyptian role and acknowledge that Africa isn't just a bunch of people living in huts making guttural noises I would totally be way more into this movie.",1402617600,,984,4.51123595505618

The movie score and the songs are just AWEFUL!  Like so many mid-80s films.  It was never a good film.  Just a money making effort to cash in on the success of Romancing The Stone...  Mike Myers could have a field day poking fun at this movie!  Still...  A nostalgic trip backwards in the time machine.  ""They really used to make movies like that?""  Yes Virginia!  Yes they did!  ...Probably, you could do a double feature by cueing up Hope & Crosby in The Road to Morroco.  Keep the popcorn coming!  As an aside...  Fun for the kid in everyone to see The Flying Karamotsov Brothers weave their juggling shenanigans into the film!  Very Marx Brotheresque!  Then...

Actually I hadn't seen ""Romancing the Stone"" so I can't relate the two movies. But I can say that the ""Jewel"" was lousy! Mostly shooting and blowing things up. Without all that noise and violence, there would be little left. I was favorably impressed by the jewel character himself, but he alone fails to redeem a really crappy movie. Mike Douglas should have refused to be a part of it.

The Blu-Ray is nice but not quite as good as Romancing The Stone. It has a little grain in the picture that the other one didn't have, but it is still way better than the Dvd version. The Audio sounded pretty good to me through my regular Stereo system {nothing fancy} but sometimes the explosions & gun shots seemed to be too loud for me but that's not really a problem.

270380,2,6300248097,"This film is a lame attempt to capitalize on the immensely popular, and sizzling, Romancing the Stone.  This time around, however the new screenwriter (that took over the reins from RTS' original screenwriter, Diane Thomas, who was now busy helping Steven Spielberg develop his romantic epic, Always) went for more of a core relationship between the two leads, Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas) and Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner), with dismal consequences.  The romance that brought them together in RTS is largely gone, replaced now by a kind of boredom and disdain.  Jack still very much loves Joan, and, in male-establishment '80s form, wants her to follow his every lead as he sails around the world, but Joan, in feminist '80s form, wants out.  We'd see this kind of relationship, with equal disdain, later from our two leads when they played a husband and wife in The War of the Roses, but this is not the way I, and undoubtedly much of the public, wants to see them!  They're Tracy and Hepburn!  We like it when they were enchanted with each other, and in chasing the object of the quest.  Frankly, they're SEXIER in RTS.  Here, they bicker like an old married couple.  Guess this is what happens with extended cohabitation.  The transfer is fine, but the story doesn't quite work this time around for me.",1329696000,,1310,4.782222222222222
270381,5,6300248097,"""Jewel of the Nile"" was a great followup to ""Romancing the Stone"" -- a movie I first saw by accident!  My girlfriend and I went to see something special and it was sold out.  But we'd driven so far to this movie house we decided to see SOMETHING!  We looked at the marquee and saw Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in a new film (Romancing the Stone) we hadn't even heard of, and decided to go for it.  Must I say that this was one of the very best action/romance adventures of recent decades?!  You betcha!  So it wasn't much of a thought process to go see it's sequel -- and we were happy to see the return of Danny DeVito as well!
The amount of action was increased for this movie, maybe because shoot-'em-ups outperform romances -- who knows.  But it all worked out well, with another nasty villain, the Brothers Karamazov (who aren't really brothers) playing juggling Arabs, and a person (SPOILER ALERT!) that is indeed a jewel of a fellow!  Turner's naivet about the chap she's doing a story on doesn't last long, but she is reluctant to mention her discovery of exactly what the Jewel of the Nile is to her lover (Douglas) who is still thinking of some treasure of a Jewel -- like in Romancing the Stone.
Mainly it's one long chase -- with the bad guy pursuing them across the desert to prevent them telling the story of what he is up to -- but when was the last time you saw a chase that involved an F-16 Fighter Aircraft ---- on the ground?!  There are some interludes for Turner and Douglas along the way, but in the end there are two grand climaxes: defeating the bad guys plan and getting married!  End of sequels...  With the prices that Amazon is offering for these Blu-Ray discs it was not a hard decision for me to make -- get 'em both!!  Seldom does a pair of movies come along that make you laugh as much, and feel for the all the characters involved.  Oh yes -- you can give your older DVD versions of these movies to a friend who may not yet have caught the real jewel in movies today -- Blu-Ray!",1327881600,,2018,4.2928759894459105

This is essentially a lame attempt at comedy with some ludicrous adventure thrown in. Poorly written it doesn't work very well.

Colton (Michael Douglas) and Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner), who in the interim have been making their leisurely way around the world on the sailing yacht Jack bought with the money he got from selling the giant emerald El Corazon.  Unfortunately familiarity has begun to breed, if not contempt, at least frustration, which isn't helped by the fact that Joan is suffering severe writer's block; apparently living a romance isn't conducive to writing one.  When a flamboyant Arab (Spiros Focas) invites her to write his biography, she leaps at the chance--not only is he attractive, but she thinks it may be time for her to move on to more serious efforts.  But Omar turns out not to be what she thinks, and Jack, joined by their rather inept nemesis Ralph (Danny DeVito) from Colombia, sets out to rescue her.  Meanwhile Joan has discovered that the ""jewel of the Nile"" that everyone (including Ralph and, to an extent, Jack) is looking for is in fact a desert holy man (Avner Eisenberg) who is also a prisoner of Omar's, and the two of them have contrived an escape.  With plenty of humor and wild action, and a great turn by the Flying Karamazov Brothers as five Sufi warriors, this is a fun variation on both romance and action movies that owes at least a tip of its hat to Indiana Jones.",1305331200,7,1337,4.600840336134453

270488,2,6300248097,"I had forgotten about the movie ""Jewel of the Nile"" (1985) until I attended a small performing arts theater tucked into the wilderness of the Lake Region of Maine. There - in a theater that looked more like a barn than a stage -- I caught the rather amusing one-man show of Avner Eisenberg.

He did physical comedy, mostly complicated pratfalls. While perusing his biography in the program, I found this nugget: Eisenberg appeared in ""The Jewel of the Nile"" as the jewel.

What? I thought, is it even possible that I never watched the sequel to ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984)? But I had no memory of the movie -none. So when I got home, I rented it.

And it all came back to me - like a horrible nightmare.

""The Jewel of the Nile"" is proof that you can't always return to the well. Because sometimes the well water turns into putrid sewage and if you drink it: you will die.

My first reaction was to track down Eisenberg and beat him with a rubber chicken.

""Jewel"" is an epic disaster - a sequel so ill-thought out, poorly directed, horribly written, and featuring performances so lackluster one could argue that Michael Douglas wasn't even aware that he was in the movie. And I had seen it before - but had purged the memory from my brain.

I actually turned it off, but the next night, I was drawn back to it like a moth to a candle. The movie was so damn bad that I couldn't help myself. It's unfortunate because ""Romancing the Stone"" was such an unexpected pleasure. It brought a refresh to the old-fashioned romantic adventure - with some laughs thrown in.

What made ""Romancing the Stone"" a hit was the chemistry between Kathleen Turner's Joan Wilder and Douglas's Jack Colton. She was the repressed writer and he was the wild, roguish adventurer. The way the two actors played off each other made for a funny, delightful escape.

However, the success led to the rushed making of the sequel the very next year.

And sometimes speed kills.

The biggest problem with ""Jewel"" is the writing. The script is so improbable that it borders on the ridiculous. We're supposed to believe that Wilder - a bestselling romance novelist - would agree to write a biography about a Middle Eastern dictator she knows absolutely nothing about (he turns out to be a deranged tyrant).

Never mind the outrageous probability that said dictator, Prince Omar (played without irony by Spiros Focas), would even consider personally traveling halfway across the world to recruit a romance writer as his official biographer. The question viewers want answered is: ""Why?"" Unfortunately, there is no answer.

Then there's an attempt at a plot where Eisenberg - playing an oafish, but lovable religious leader - must be killed by the dictator so he can become the ultimate ruler of this fictional Middle Eastern kingdom before Eisenberg can be. Who this ""Jewel"" is and how he became a powerful religious icon is never explained. In fact, we're not quite sure what religion we're even talking about.

But forget all the plot holes and the lapses in reason that riddle the script. Hell, forget about the bloated budget and the unnecessary explosions and camel chases (but most of all forget about Danny DeVito, who delivers one of his worse performances ever).

The real problem with ""Jewel"" is that Douglas and Turner spend the majority of the movie separated.

Amazing, isn't it?

But how can that be, one might ask. Wasn't the success of the first movie the tit-for-tat exchanges between the actors? Wasn't it the super-charged romantic chemistry that ignited the screen the first time?

Apparently, the producers, director and writers forgot about that.

Like most of the movies we feature in Fantastically Bad Cinema - ""The Jewel of the Nile"" has to be seen to be believed. Just suspend any notion that you might be watching a real movie and dive into one of the most disappointing busts of the eighties.

270491,4,6300248097,"It's been a few months since Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas) and Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) sailed off into the sunset (literally).  They are now in the Greek isles.  Jack loves their life of leisure living on their yacht, but Joan is getting board and is fighting a major case of writer's block.  In fact, she can't seem to finish her latest book, which is already overdue to the publisher.

Things change when Joan gets an offer she thinks she can't refuse.  Omar (Spiros Focas) is about to become King of his country in Africa, and he is a fan of Joan's work.  He wants Joan to write his biography.  She is delighted and jumps at the chance, even though Jack isn't interested, and the two split.

But things aren't as they seem.  Joan soon learns that Omar isn't all he pretended to be and she must write only what he approves.  Jack gets wind of the danger and set off to rescue her.  Can he find her?  Will they get away?  And what is this jewel that everyone is trying to find?

Often time, sequels feel like retreads, going over the same ground as the original.  Here, the movie truly feels like a continuation of Romancing the Stone, putting familiar characters in a completely new situation.  I found the film just as funny, adventurous, and romantic as the first.

It does have a big flaw, however.  Danny DeVito returns as Ralph, one of the bumbling bad guys from the first movie.  While he give another fine performance, I found his inclusion highly unlikely.  And his storyline went nowhere for most of the film as well.  I think the film would have been stronger if they had left him out.

The first film had tons of foul language.  This one continues the trend, although it seemed to be toned down some here.  Still, parents will probably want to judge for themselves if it is appropriate for their child.

While I enjoy most sequels I see, I do notice they often aren't as good.  This is a rare case where both films in the series are just as entertaining.  So if you liked the first, don't hesitate to watch this one, too.",1212624000,3,2043,4.436657681940701

 If you are used to the Real Indiana Jones movies then this an insult to filmmaking.

 On the other hand, I have several copies of the original ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in widescreen, now that movie is  a m a z i n g  . Do yourself a favor and watch the widescreen version of Indiana Jones instead of this bul****  good luck,

270538,4,6300248097,"Rarely does a sequel to a smash movie rise to the same level as its predecessor - but perhaps Jewel of the Nile is the exception (along with some of the Indiana Jones follow-ups).
This sequel to Romancing the Stone, a rip-snorter adventure/romance with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas, set the stage for this 2nd one. They've been together since the end of the 1st movie, living on his yacht. She is on assignment in the Middle East when she's abducted, and it's up to Douglas and of course Danny DeVito, to rescue her.
Good stuff, but not quite 5-star.",1082419200,10,557,4.58
270539,5,6300248097,"Jewel of the Niel is the sequel to Romancing the Stone also with Michael Douglas,Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito. The Movie stars off kind of slow but once the movie goes over seas to the Middle-East it gets alot better I don't want to give away to much but this movie should not be missed. Also to readers of this review if you like these two movies you the actors in it you should check out WAR OF THE ROSES",1077494400,,410,4.1375
270540,2,6300248097,"Not too bad for a sequel, but this film has absolutely none of the ""magic"" of the original.  Everything seems forced, contrived, and artificial by comparison.  As others have noted, the story ended precisely where it should have at the close of ""Romancing the Stone.""  Too bad they did not leave well enough alone.",1074643200,4,314,4.777777777777778
270541,4,6300248097,"THE JEWEL OF THE NILE is a sequel to ROMANCING THE STONE. The director and the screenwriters are new but Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito are back in their old familiar roles. The cast also includes Spiros Focas and Avner Eisenberg.
This time the adventure takes place in North Africa where Turner is invited to accompany a wealthy Arab to his own country. She soon finds herself caught in another big mess in a very strange land. Naturally Douglas has to rescue her as he did before in ROMANCING THE STONE.
Danny DeVito's  best scene comes near the beginning of the film when he suddenly emerges from a barrel on a dock with a rapid-fire description of his experiences in a Columbian jail. On balance JEWEL OF THE NILE is an entertaining movie but it does not quite recapture the magic of ROMANCING THE STONE.",1053734400,3,827,4.625850340136054
270542,4,6300248097,"Just about everyone who orders this title has seen it before. So this is in regards to Video quality. If you must own the movie fine then by all means purchase it but be warned the DVD movie quality is atrocious. I must have about 100 movies now and of course you do expect some dropouts and scratches on older titles but this one really takes the cake in my opinion. This copy is littered with dropouts "" small white specs"" , scratches and well just a plain dirty rendition of a superb movie. I have no clue why a DVD production house would allow something this bad to go into mass production unless they just believe that Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner fans will buy anything with them in it. I was beginning to believe that when you purchased a DVD you were getting the absolute best that these companies could offer. NOT SO, It appears that the bottom line is still about making a profit. Sadly enough its the consumer that ends up flipping the bill. The intros and menus are top notch superb DVD quality. And it starts out ok but gets prgressively worse. Honestly guys this movie could have been mastered from a better copy instead... well for us Douglas Turner fans a complete and sad letdown.",1050969600,27,1204,4.452488687782806
270543,4,6300248097,"Romancing The stone probably is a better movie as it is more exciting but its sequel ""The Jewel Of the Nile"" is every bit as entertaining. 3 principle stars (Douglas, Turner, DeVito) are all wonderful.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for the DVD short comings. No Dolby 5.1 and the picture quality is below averae. A remastered edition probably is unlikely so grab this one as Fox already dropped its retail price from ...",995328000,2,428,4.487179487179487
270544,3,6300248097,"The success of ""Romancing the Stone"" wasn't in the non-stop bickering between the principals. Rather, that was a component in a film -- one of my favorites -- that had a lot of other things going for it, like atmosphere, an intersting B-story featuring rival groups of antagonists, an interesting setting and, most importantly, the tension between Joan Wilder's romantic fictions and her romantic reality.
With ""Jewel of the Nile,"" everything is gone except for the bickering. The most enjoyable villain is reformed (mostly), the setting is generic (and fairly insulting) Middle East, and the adventure features little of the fun that informed the first movie.
Apparently, there's a script for a third movie floating around in Hollywood that's allegedly far superior to ""Jewel of the Nile,"" and there are people who are reportedly disappointed they couldn't ever make it, due to the lack of success this film had. I'm sorry, but ""Jewel of the Nile"" got what it deserved: It's a middle of the road remake to a film that really lucked into its breakout status to begin with. This is by-the-book filmmaking, and comes off that way.
Whereas I am pleased to own ""Romancing the Stone,"" ""Jewel of the Nile"" is definitely just a rental, at best.",977616000,4,1237,4.923444976076555
270545,5,6300248097,"This movie is awesome, I don't give a dang what anybody says, it is one of the most well done romance movies I have seen yet. It is so funny I laughed all the way through it the first time... and have re-watched it over and over, and it never wears out as a love story. Haven't found any others with such good direction or fitting musical scores yet. I give it 5 of 5 stars... and always will!

Jack is scruffy and rude, and Joan lives a sheltered life of writing romance novels. But when these two meet, whoa boy! These two movies are equally good (a rare thing for a movie and it's sequel) and are must haves if you think the Indiana Jones movies are the only good adventure movies.",973036800,,417,4.573333333333333
