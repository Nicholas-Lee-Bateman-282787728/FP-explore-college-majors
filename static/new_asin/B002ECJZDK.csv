8367546,4,B002ECJZDK,"I saw some version of this ""Hit Favorites"" on sale pretty cheap, so I bought it. I wasn't impressed with the format, having to watch intros & credits between each show, but what does it matter what I think? My 3.5 year old loves it. I have since bought several themes of these, Halloween, Fall (I think??), Animals, Spring, Christmas. They are pretty cheap compared to most kids DVD's. He likes them all! Didn't hold the attention of my 18m old, however.",1351209600,,454,4.548780487804878
8367547,4,B002ECJZDK,"Trick or Treat Tales is the perfect DVD for toddlers and preschoolers. I thought perhaps because of the title that it may be a bit more scary but I should have known better.

With lovable characters like Barney, Thomas and Fifi...it was not the least bit scary or worrisome.

My girls found it enjoyable and quietly watch the show with me while explaining who each character was exactly.

While my daughters enjoyed it...I believe the Trick or Treat Tales DVD is best for children five and under. All the cartoons were adorable and fun story lines but they may be a bit to passive for older children.

My personal favorite was Fifi and the Flowertots...she is a cutie! This is great alternative video for Halloween if you have little ones that are too small to trick or treat late into the night.

Fun characters, cute story lines...perfect for popped corn and family time.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HIT-Favorites-Trick-or-Treat-Tales/dp/B002ECJZDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HIT Favorites: Trick or Treat Tales</a>",1253318400,,1058,5.546583850931677
