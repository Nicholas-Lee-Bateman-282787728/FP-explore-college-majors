8629978,4,B00H4P7I7M,"My only critique is that I wanted this film to last longer.

I've lived in this part of St. Paul for 20+ years and this black and white moving snapshot captures the angled light, the icy sidewalks and the stubborn refusal to modernize of this westernmost eastern town.  St. Paul has always been about transportation, since the first steamboats docked in the 1800's, unable to navigate further north on the Mississippi.  The first shots of the Amtrack station, the vistas of University Avenue, the sidewalks (and sidewalks) and the buses and bridges provide a rhythmic backdrop for Paul D's laconic verse, and give clues to both the past and the future of St. Paul. Soon light rail trains will be winding their way along University, bringing (it is hoped) new investment and urban renewal, but this film will preserve for future generations images of post-war buildings, snarled intersections, and a part of town where it is indeed possible, as Paul demonstrates, to walk for miles and miles along city sidewalks, dodging snowbanks and an ever-late 21A bus on Selby Avenue.",1389139200,,1072,4.944444444444445
