3650463,4,B001J1HTNA,"This is a good fun time recording of a band that plays a mix of Blues and Jazz that blends together very well and is very well recorded. I did not encounter a lip sink problem the 2nd time I played it possibly due to the OPPO BDP-83 fixing the problem. The 1st time there was a slight lip sink lag when any one sang but the music was right on time. This is a very good BD, but not stellar. Mike's playing seemed a little off but the rest of the band was tight and on time. The audio mix is very good as well as the video production. Crisp and clear Audio and Video makes this a worth while addition to anyone who likes the Mike Stern Band, or Robin Ford style Blues and or Jazz.

 I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.****
2.*****
3.*****

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1270425600,3,1357,4.326771653543307
3650464,1,B001J1HTNA,"Just a quick note,

I have had the DVD of this show for a while and love the performance.  I was very excited to see the Blu-ray version was coming but when I received the disc I was really disappointed.  The audio/video is not synched.  The audio is about a half second behind what is going on visually.  I returned the disc.  I hope they correct this and re-release the Blu-ray version.",1253059200,6,388,4.319444444444445
8311715,5,B001J1HTNA,"I'm watching/listening as I type this... With all due respect to any musician that has played with Mike Stern in the past, this group of guys fits the mold perfectly! This puts his previous dvd from Paris to shame! Dave, Tom and Bob bring to the stage what nobody else can to their instruments. As Mike's sound is concerened, I am such a fan of his bop/jazz tone. No one else plays it better in my opinion!

One of the things I love most about this concert is the sound that comes from it. It's so well mixed that if you turn it up loud enough you'll actually feel like you are in the club. Quite a treat!

All 4 of these guys are some of my all time favorite musicians, regardless of which instrument and to have all 4 on the same stage together just tearing it up from start to finish is quite a music lover's dream come true!",1474588800,,828,4.136645962732919
8311716,5,B001J1HTNA,"This is not for the faint of heart. This is for the serious music listener. Mike Stern takes you on a mind bending journey on every song on this brilliant DVD. Stern is a true virtuoso in every sense of the word.
The first song alone, Tumble Home, is a 20 minute epic that showcases Stern's gift for extended, fluid, and diverse soloing. All that follows is just doing what Mike Stern doesdazzle with inventiveness. The intensity of their final number, ""Chromazone"", is musicianship at it's finest.
Dave Weckl received big ovations from the crowd for his always stellar drumming. Bass player Tom Kennedy has just the right amount of funk at one end and finesse at the other to accompany Stern nicely. Bob Franceschini's soulful and powerful tenor sax compliments the ensemble superbly.
If you are a fan of Mike Stern you will very much appreciate this DVD. If, on the other hand, you are unfamiliar with his music I would suggest sampling some before making a purchase. This is far from simplistic melody and beat driven jazz.",1438473600,2,1026,4.737430167597766
8311717,2,B001J1HTNA,"This is really boring and aimless in my opinion. The guitar was least enjoyable part with the same ""chorus"" effect going through the same guitar the entire concert.  That is not entertainment.",1427068800,,192,5.0
8311718,5,B001J1HTNA,"great sound, great song, I totally recomended, just sit back and listen to real jazz!!",1421971200,,86,4.8
8311719,5,B001J1HTNA,"Amazing Live and Captured on this disk.
If you are looking for capture as bit of the current tour with Eric Johnson...you have half here.
Bob Franceschini - Tenor Sax - Fluid and brings it home
Highly recommended",1416873600,,212,4.605263157894737
8311720,5,B001J1HTNA,"Note this is different than the other, older Paris concert. Didn't notice it is necessarily HD quality but sound is excellent.",1391817600,,126,5.0476190476190474
8311721,5,B001J1HTNA,"Another excellent entry to the New Morning series of jazz guitar DVDs. Mike Stern tears it up, and looks relaxed and like he's having fun. His band is amazing, especially Dave Weckl on drums. Fans of fusion, and great guitar playing in general, will appreciate this performance!",1390262400,,278,4.9361702127659575
8311722,5,B001J1HTNA,"I was very impressed with Mike Stern and knowing his pedigree, expected exactly what I paid for in this DVD.  Thank you for such a great selection of top Stern plays and sessions while his other players are all top drawer in every regard.  You MUST be to keep up with this man.",1388448000,,277,4.2075471698113205
8311723,5,B001J1HTNA,"A graduate of The Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Mike Stern has played with the likes of Blood, Sweat & Tears, The Yellowjackets, and Miles Davis.  This concert, performed in Paris, with a backing band of super heavyweight musicians, is a show of shows: just fantastic!  And from the reactions of those lucky enough to be in attendance, the crowd loved, loved, loved it!  Mike Stern is a truly AMAZING guitarist, and you can tell that he is in love with what he does!",1347321600,2,473,4.541176470588235
8311724,5,B001J1HTNA,"Just a quick note to let other jazz fans know that as we wait for lots of great Montreux and Japanese Videos to make their way to Re-Mastered Blu-Ray that this Mike Stern concert is one of the best Blu-Rays we have.

The picture quality is outstanding and razor sharp and the audio is very clean despite past complaints about the DVD Version which we have not seen,

This particular video has Tom Kennedy on Bass who is just a powerhouse and I would say Mike is in very good form although after seeing him live in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York's famous 55 Bar in the last month, I highly recommend that you see Mike and Band play an early and late set to capture the true talent of today's best jazz fusion guitarist who can play classic jazz, Rocking Fusion and hard rock in a smooth transition during one song. We love you Mike
