5088815,5,B007I6TOIS,"... but I pulled the cord anyways on this and volumes 2 and three. I was quite afraid that the recent horrors of the Fox carelessly thrown together classic multidisc sets would follow this one, but it's sturdily constructed. None of the discs are in card board sleeves, none have glue on the back, the transfers are very good and none of the discs are scratched. I'd recommend this package.",1367539200,31,390,4.585714285714285
5088816,5,B007I6TOIS,"I have just purchased Volumes 1,2 and 3 of the Shirley Temple Movies on DVD.  I am generally a mystery and detective DVD purchaser and viewer.  But these movies of Shirley Temple came up on my email from Amazon.  I looked at it and looked at it again of all the listed movies, pondered over it and said to myself why not.  Shirley Temple as a child actor was the cutest most adoreable little miss and plus that extremely talented.  I think I will be very happy with my purchase.  I have had time to think about my purchase since placing my order, I have held back sending my review, I am very happy with this purchase.",1366502400,2,618,4.239316239316239

5088819,5,B007I6TOIS,"I gave this Shirley Temple Compiliation 5-stars in that it is perfect! The audio and picture quality is very good; especially for the age of these movies.  Furthermore, this compilation offers the option to watch each movie in its original 'black and white' state or in color.  Last, you get a good diversity in this collection.  I mean, you get Shirley Temple films such as 'Captain January' ranging to 'Ms. Broadway.'  The genre selection covers one side of the spectrum to the other (Cowboys and Indians; to Broadway tapdancing; to Sailors).  These movies are perfect for a rainy Saturday evening with the family!  Today's actors do not even come close to yester-years'!",1363564800,58,673,4.964285714285714

8517364,5,B007I6TOIS,"I just got this dvd set yesterday and am very impressed with the quality. I expected there to be one or two disks to house this 6 movie set. Instead there are 6 disks , One movie on each disk. The disks are very solid and thick not flimsy like some are. The quality of the film is excellent. There are 2 versions on each disk , Black and white or color. I already watched two movies last nite. She really was such a talented little girl. I love the scene where she dances with Buddy Epson , Classic. I would purchase again ! ",1524700800,,525,4.048076923076923
