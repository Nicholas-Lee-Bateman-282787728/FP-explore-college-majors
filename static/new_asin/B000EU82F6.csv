8114316,5,B000EU82F6,"My 3-year-old twins really enjoy this DVD and ask for it again and again.  The music is great and easy on parental ears, too!  It's a great tool to use to help teach your children about the value of money.  My daughter is already ""getting it"" -- just the other day she held up a penny and started to sing, ""One coin for the Coconut Card!""",1153699200,2,338,4.090909090909091
8114317,5,B000EU82F6,"I am very impressed with this DVD!  And most importantly, so are my three children.  My kids (ranging from age 1-1/2 to 3-1/2) ALL enjoy this show.  My older son appreciates the relationships between the characters and is getting a grasp of the importance of money in his life and is learning how to make smart decisions about spending.  My younger children LOVE the music and energy of the show.  All three kids ask for me to play it over and over again!  I'm so happy to have found a show that's entertaining for my kids and teaches important values at the same time.  I'm going to buy this for all of our upcoming birthdays.  This is one DVD that I am HAPPY to play over again!",1150588800,2,680,4.299212598425197
