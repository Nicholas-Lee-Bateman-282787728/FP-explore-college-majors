2439743,4,B000BT96E6,"First time screenwriter David Patterson adapted his own play 'Finger Painting in a Murphy Bed' for the film LOVE, LUDLOW making the onus of the success of the film rest heavily on his shoulders. Fortunately the producers found first-time director Adrienne J. Weiss who has capably transformed a delicate triangle into a solid little comedy.  If polish is lacking in the final product it can easily be forgiven by the fact that this is a new venture.

A three character story, each of the three people we get to know is borderline functional in their approach to life and the world at large.  Myra (Alicia Goranson) is a hard working office temp but is socially crippled by the fact that she is the caretaker for her bipolar brother Ludlow (Brendan Sexton III) who is confined to their tiny apartment and demands every ounce of Myra's attention.  At work, love starved but socially anxious Myra meets Reggie (David Eigenberg), a gentle naive soul who has never been in any type of relationship.  The two socially inept people find 'something that is missing' in their lives, but when Myra faces the fact that she is confined to quarters due to the obligation compulsive Ludlow's care and when Reggie meets Ludlow and realizes Myra is unable to move out of her life space due to Ludlow's childlike tantrums and demands, the strange trio's compatibility is challenged and the method in which the three cope with the big decisions in their lives is the resolution of the movie.

The dialogue is sharp but more in keeping with a stage drama than a film: there is a lack of flow, which is not the fault of the editors or the cinematographer or the director.  The script is stage bound.  But given that fact, this is a modern comedy, funny at times, aching at times, but always reflecting the innate humor in even the saddest of human lives.  The trio of leads gives fine performances as do the supporting cast members.  In a year where sibling dysfunction is one of the topics du jour, LOVE, LUDLOW  holds up well in the competition.

2439744,5,B000BT96E6,I saw this film at the Stoneybrook Film Festival this summer and thought it was fantastic.  The dialogue is sharply written and makes for a witty exchange between the 3 main characters.  An atypical but rewarding romantic comedy.  Standout performance by Alicia Goranson- I couldn't believe that I was watching the girl from Roseanne.,1132704000,,334,5.148148148148148
2439745,5,B000BT96E6,"This was my favorite film at the Sundance Film Festival this past year and the one film that proves to me that a small independent production can look and feel just like a quality big budgeted studio film.  The actors are superb, the cinematography is phenomenal, and the writing is brilliant.  Roger Ebert called this film, ""A Sundance Treasure"" and I totally agree.  This is one of those water cooler films you'll be talking about at work for quite a long time. You just have to see this film!",1132531200,3,495,4.53932584269663

2439747,5,B000BT96E6,"I saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival.  It is a quirky love story filled with laughter and tears.  Alicia (Myra) did a great job.  Her facial expressions are so funny.  All of the actors are right on.  The tension between Ludlow and the other characters is so real.  The writing is brilliant.  If you like independent films, this is a great one!",1132358400,3,353,4.421875
2439748,4,B000BT96E6,"I really enjoyed this film, it's full of heart and the performances are great. Also, the cinematography is something special. I HIGHLY recommend this film as a Saturday night rental or a great gift for that filmy person that wants to stay ahead of the curve. - koleyr",1132272000,2,267,4.583333333333333
8091916,5,B000BT96E6,We really enjoyed the movie.  It was both sad and sweet!  I was surprised by the R rating because it did not deserve that rating (should be PG13),1363478400,,145,4.142857142857143
8091917,4,B000BT96E6,I like the actors and the attitude of the main leading lady.  She had very good lines. I gave this movie four starts because the acting was good and believable.  The story is a little slow but I founded very interesting and different contraire to my husband's opinion.  He found it boring and lost interest right away.,1349913600,,318,4.543859649122807
8091918,4,B000BT96E6,"A slightly screwy love affair, between a man, a woman and the woman's autistic brother (I don't mean in the incestuous, three-way way).

Man and woman meet.  They are both such opposites... quiet/loud, educated/not educated, quick tempered/laid back and a few more extremes thrown in for fun.  Then, we add in the brother who is very upset having to share his sister. Can boyfriend and brother ever get along or will brother ruin the made-in-heaven relationship in it's budding stages.

A delightful respite from all the heavy handed love affairs currently around for viewing.

One of the best Independant Films I've seen.  Thank God it wasn't a Major Studio film... that would surely have ruined it!",1262390400,,700,4.991379310344827
8091919,5,B000BT96E6,"I fell in love with this movie within the first couple minutes. I can watch it over and over again and laugh and cry every single time. I'm no expert or anything but I think that the casting was done perfectly. The actors that were chosen to play the different characters in the movie were excellent, I couldn't imagine any other actors playing those parts. This movie, as simple as it is really stands out and is deffinatley one of my all time favorites.",1262131200,,455,4.428571428571429
8091920,3,B000BT96E6,"Myra is a blond with a real brother problem in the big city.
In New York's Queens it seems that people with real emotional problems
have again reverted to the 19th century where they kept the dotty aunt in the attic room.
In the 50's and 60's we made some progress with the care
of the troubled minds. The republicans years said they aren't a public problem
and turned them out on the street. Ludlow,
but for his sister's love,
is a soon to be dead homeless person.
The problem is that she wants a life of her own
and almost by accident finds Reggie.
The fireworks that happen as a result of love in bloom
are really not very pleasant.
I liked the movie, but think it isn't for the faint of heart
or children who think all is right in the world.",1261094400,,745,4.180555555555555
8091921,5,B000BT96E6,"With ""Love, Ludlow"" David Lord Patterson (son of the woman who wrote ""Bridge to Terabithia"") crafts a short and sweet film that bubbles with quirky, snappy dialogue.  But this movie isn't just a cute little romantic comedy.  A strong dramatic undercurrent about loneliness, family, and growing up is the true core of this movie, sustained by the sheer normalness of the leading actors Alicia Goranson (Myra) and David Eigenberg (Reggie) and the total eccentricity played wonderfully by Brendan Sexton III (Ludlow).  Equipped with Patterson's masterful writing, they bring us three funny and sympathetic characters that, I guarantee, you will end up caring about by the end of this ninety minute film.

There aren't many movies I can compare this to, as it's simply such a unique gem in an otherwise bland and overdone genre.  To give you a sense of what this movie is like, I'm going to have to pick and choose from different mediums and genres.  If you like the dialogue in Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", you'll find the witty exchanges in here priceless.  If you like the outrageous and endearing characters in Christopher Moore's books, you'll make a place in your heart for Ludlow.  If you like sweet, weird, and real romances of the late ""Veronica Mars"" television series, you'll be rooting for Myra and Reggie.  If you're in the mood for a nicely done independent film that will surely make you laugh and just might make you cry, give this not-very-well-known film a chance.

8091922,5,B000BT96E6,"Love, Ludlow is a great movie that is, at first glance, little more than a quirky, funny romantic comedy. There's nothing mindshakingly original about the premise of boy meets girl, but Reggie's awkward courtship of Myra is so over-the-top that it's quite fresh. Cinematic romance usually has a fairly predictable arc, but I never felt like I knew what was coming next with this movie.

Myra's character, I think, really anchored the film, and it was because of the strong performance by Alicia Goranson. Myra is an almost impossibly caustic office temp, and I think that a lesser actress might have me wondering how someone with such a firey disposition could work in a field that requires a modicum of working well with others. But Goranson plays Myra with such authority that it just seems natural,

Similarly, the shy, awkward Reggie (David Eigenberg) might have been played as a shallow caricature of a socially-inept dweeb, but Eigenberg creditably shows him to be an earnest, caring, somewhat confused guy trying his best to win what might be the girl of his dreams.

The movie starts with Reggie being smitten with Myra, and Myra's gradual opening to the possibility of dating him. Myra's brother Ludlow is the big complication. He seems to spend most of his time in he and Myra's tiny apartment writing elaborate fairwell notes and fingerpainting.

According to the movie's description, Ludlow is bipolar. I'm no diagonstician, but he seemed a bit more autistic to me-his moods seemed fairly even, but he had definite problems interfacing with the rest of the world and accepting a break in his routine. I thought that the uncertainty about Ludlow's precise problem strengthened the movie-it makes sense that, given the family's situation, they aren't going to be taking him for a battery of psychiatric exams, and they probably wouldn't have a real diagnosis. Myra would just know, as she knows in the movie, that there is something wrong with her brother, and that it is her job to take care of him.

And this is the heart of the movie. We see that Myra, with her abraisive exterior, is hiding a terrible secret-that she really is a loving, caring, and dedicated person. She hasn't dated much not because she can't stand other people, but because she knows that no one will accept both her and Ludlow.

I've done a lot of thinking about this movie since I've seen it, and I think it really is very profound. To me, Ludlow represents the baggage that people bring to any relationship. It could be, as it is in this movie, a sibling or parent that one has to care for. It could be a sheltered past, an abusive childhood, a bad set of friends, or just the legacy of unfortunate choices made years ago. It could be memories-it could be anxieties about the future. Whatever it is, it prevents us from letting other people into our lives. It's probably true that everyone has their Ludlow, and there's a moment in every relationship when we introduce the other person to our Ludlow and hope for the best.

So Love, Ludlow is really more than just a romantic comedy about an unlikely couple. On a deeper level, it's really about something that anyone can identify with-revealing part of yourself, and your life, to someone you want to care deeply about. Like the best art, it takes something small and local-in this case, a budding relationship between a New York temp and account executive-and makes it resonate in a way that is truly universal.

I recommend it highly for anyone-I can see that it would be a fun date movie (and a real ice-breaker for a first or second date) but also something that longtime couples can get something out of.",1165881600,5,3647,4.7503949447077405
8091923,4,B000BT96E6,"If ever there was an overlooked film, Love, Ludlow would be that film.  Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival is a fantastic way to shed some light on some fantastic overlooked films, but I was semi-disappointed that this film did not attract his attention.  Not that the films that he screened weren't fantastic, but I think this one could have attracted a larger audience with the right marketing.  After appearing at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and becoming an Official Selaction, Love, Ludlow disappeared, away from the public and critic alike.  Sitting lonely on the shelf of the video store I work at, the only copy of Love, Ludlow seemed overshadowed by the big market (and often nauseating) blockbusters that litter the shelves.  The film's director is Adrienne Weiss, who takes her second, and supremely successful, shot at directing.  As the director is virtually unknown, she uses actors that aren't really prime time.  Many may recognize David Eigenberg from HBO's Sex and the City, and many others may recognize Alicia Goranson from the hit 90's series Roseanne.  Goranson is Myra, a twentysomething temp, working for a small corporation in New York, and washing some of local tenants' laundry so she can support herself and her brother Ludlow (Brendan Sexton III), who is mentally challenged and was left to her keeping after the death of their mother.  Eigenberg is Reggie, a co-worker of Myra's, who becomes attracted to her angry, Bronx-girl personality.  They begin to date, and we begin to see Ludlow feeling like a third wheel in the relationship.  Although we feel bad for Ludlow, we certainly cannot expect Myra staying single just to spend every waking moment with Ludlow.  Ludlow begins to act out, taking Reggie's keys and making him pay forty dollars, and spend the night to get them back.  Reggie tries his best to form a positive relationship with Ludlow, but as Reggie gets closer, Ludlow pushes him away.  Eigenberg does his best work in this film, and we see early in the film his frustration with Ludlow, only to lead to a scene where he blows up and yells at Ludlow for ""running away"".  Sexton does a nice job of playing Ludlow without venturing into the more severely disabled roles of Hoffman's Rain Man or Sean Penn's I Am Sam, and I enjoyed watching his performances and seeing where he would take the character next.  Goranson, on the other hand, was more difficult to disect.  At first I thought her performance was a bit stiff and unchallenging, but as I look further at it, she does a decent job at conveying a character who hides her emotions behind a wall, that is her Bronx-girl attitude.  We do see her break down once or twice in the film, but it is always restrained as she tries to put out a strong personality.  She is, in fact, semi-new to the idea of dating, and she has never really expressed other emotions, besides anger.  She needs to be tough.  She is living in a world where a large amount of responsibility has been dumped on her, and no one, even the tenants in her building, shows much sympathy.  The film is a quick, 86-minute view, and I highly reccomend seeing this film.  It has good leading and supporting performances, although, I could have done without some of the eccentricities that come with some of these characters.  The character of Carol, a co-worker of Myra's who lives with her mother, is a bit unneccesary in the beginning, and I wasn't really compelled by her.  She does provide a moment of relief during a very funny scene involving yet another co-worker named Storkelson, a sexist pig who insists on sharing his sexual stories.  Overall, Love, Ludlow is not the best film of 2005, but it is funny, charming, and highly entertaining.",1153094400,4,3718,4.779342723004695
8091924,3,B000BT96E6,"There are some incredibly sweet moments in this movie.  I loved Alicia Goranson on Roseanne and she is truly darling.  But her acting range at this juncture is dominated by three or four wide-eyed expressions that, over time, become cloying.  This movie is predictable and the Ludlow character does not have enough charm to carry his share of the movie.  Over all, a mild disappointment. The movie you should see instead is Me and You and Everyone We Know.",1145836800,,456,4.734177215189874
