8432498,4,B004K6MGIY,"this contains three of Bruce Lee's best films the big boss, way of the dragon, and game of death. the big boss was Bruce's first starring role and game of death was is last. all three show Bruce as a great master of Kung Fu. the story lines aren't bad but I do have some questions. like both the big boss and way of the dragon have a seen involving a prostitute. in the big boss Bruce's wakes up next to her after people get him drunk. in way of the dragon the prostitute picks Bruce up, yes a prostitute picks up a john on the street, how doesn't love Rome. also in way of the dragon what is up with that seen at the airport where they zoom in on Chuck Norris's crotch. and the last one in game of death what is up with those shorts they gave Carrem Abdul Jibbar to wear.",1503964800,,772,3.9870967741935486

Then when you want to finish off your collection buy this, and... BAM! You own all the Bruce Lee movies worth owning!

The first 2 movies in the set are Way of the Dragon and The Big Boss, both great fun. Big Boss is super corny and poorly made but Lee is awesome as always and there are some great fights as well as an empowering ""rise up against your oppressors"" plot. Way of the Dragon is a step up from Big Boss, with an obviously higher budget and some recognizable actors (Chuck Norris and Robert Wall). The movie has a decent plot and a great but underused location (Rome). It also contains the excellent fight scene between Norris and Lee which has since gone down in Kung Fu history as one of the best. The last movie is Game of Death, Bruce Lee's movie that would have been spectacular had he not, unfortunately, passed before it could be completed. The producers decided to try to complete the film without Lee and what we are left with is... crap. While parts of it are hilarious because they are so bad, it's also just a sad reminder of what the movie and Mr. Lee could have become if he had not been taken from us so soon. For that reason alone it is an important film that should be seen by anyone who calls themselves a fan of the legend.

The DVDs are actually previous releases, there is even a box-set with these exact same DVDs that was released a few years ago. I prefer this newer release though because of the slim case and nice package design, the movies also have some great special features.

All in all, while these are not his best movies they are still a must see for anyone interested in the legend that is Bruce Lee... cause really there is no Bruce Lee movie NOT worth watching (even Game of Death).",1329350400,3,1906,4.393767705382436
8432501,5,B004K6MGIY,"The Bruce Lee Ultimate Trilogy is a must have for fans of martial arts, Bruce Lee, or shirtless men in general. I watch these movies over and over with my friends and have yet to get tired of seeing good ol' Bruce give out ball shots left and right.",1326067200,,249,4.1020408163265305
8432502,1,B004K6MGIY,"What a lame retread of Fox's pre-Blu-ray Ultimate Edition!

It's not even as good with fewer movies!  Fox is doing the old double-dip  la Lord of the Rings except they're trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of people who don't own these yet before releasing them on Blu-ray, which I guarantee will probably happen sometime in the near future.  Hopefully when Fox does release them on BD they'll have more interviews and some commentary tracks like some of the European versions.

If you don't want to wait for Fox to get on the ball, go to [...] where they're already available on Blu-ray from Hong Kong!  Shipping rates are reasonable and Southeast Asia (which includes Hong Kong) is is the same Blu-ray region as North and South America, region A.",1301961600,2,752,4.659090909090909
