8351484,1,B0025ZA8VE,This is not a music DVD is how to play guitar like Johnny Winter,1440201600,,64,3.642857142857143
8351485,4,B0025ZA8VE,"Lets just get to the problem with this DVD. The structure of the DVD is one where Johnny Winter performers a piece and the teacher then breaks down the piece lick by lick in wonderful detail. The only problem is the teacher only shows you HALF THE BLOODY PIECE. I worked my way through the first piece thinking this is great and then ..... out of now where we just move on to the next tune  .... leaving out half the song that Johnny played . It felt like I was on a guided tour and the tour guide just ran off mid tour with no explanation leaving me alone and afraid  in a cave all by myself. This DVD is great as a source of lick ideas and, the ideas are top of the line blues licks. Also Johnny's playing on the DVD is not great , he is playing on of the ugliest guitars I have ever seen with an horrific sound . It looks and sounds like some child's toy guitar with children star stickers all over. It is a great DVD to source some ideas that the teacher deems worthy from the songs Johnny performs on the DVD, not a place to lean the songs not for note. It may have been better to just focus on 3 of Johnny's songs from start to finish with a backing track than have so many half finished tunes.",1439769600,4,1200,3.995833333333333

8351487,5,B0025ZA8VE,"You need to be quite advanced (probably a pro) to get this stuff under your fingers. I'm a hobbyist at guitar. I can play, know chords, scales, can play along to stuff on the radio; and if I have time to woodshed it, I can figure out most lead solos. I'm a huge Johnny Winter fan, so I took the plunge. I realized I was in over my head quite quickly. Johnny Winter actually plays styles he emulated over the years; then Al Eck meticulously breaks down what Johnny just did. What's amazing is the breakdown entails far much more than what you thought you heard Johnny play. That's because of Johnny's fluidity yet speed-of-light-playing. There is a ton of stuff going on in these recognizable riffs that the ear doesn't quite catch. The content is great. Al Eck is a pro and can flat play; plus he's a great teacher with a very laid back pleasant manner..it's just that this stuff is for very accomplished players.",1427155200,4,913,4.473053892215569

8351489,5,B0025ZA8VE,"Not for beginner's, but really great watching the ""great one"" play his licks for you!",1418428800,,85,4.733333333333333
8351490,5,B0025ZA8VE,Al Eck does an incredible job of dissecting Johnny's style as well as Johnny's emulations of the styles of some of HIS heroes. Very informative. A good value for the money. I learn something new or a new application of some licks that I already knew everytime I watch.,1366848000,3,268,4.489795918367347
8351491,5,B0025ZA8VE,"I'm a fan of Johnny Winter since the 70's , your voice and Guitar are a great personal in the Rock And Blues , Johnny is Forever",1294012800,,128,3.7777777777777777
8351492,4,B0025ZA8VE,"Johnny Winter - a great and very gifted musician.  On these 2 DVDs Johnny plays a variety of blues songs reflecting differing artists such as Muddy Waters to BB King.  Al Ek  proceeds to break down each song after Johnny plays it, into its' parts for you to learn.  Al is a great teacher in that he shows each note with finger and fret position.  The only thing that would have helped is to include a tab booklet.  My advice to you if you purchase these DVDs is to shorten the learning process by creating your own tab for these songs.
  Upon viewing these DVDs, you realize that it is going to take a lot of time and effort to learn and commit to memory any song -  there is no way around it.  I think there is a place for copying and having a number of songs that you really like in your repetoire.  However, having said that,I personally think it is more rewarding to learn and create your own songs.  Both approaches will cost you in time and effort.  My simplistic advice is to use your time and effort wisely as they are in limited supply.
  I saw Johnny Winter in concert years ago and he, along with his brother Edgar are fantastic musicians.  If you like the Blues, these DVDs are the way to go.",1260662400,22,1204,4.214912280701754
8351493,5,B0025ZA8VE,I have had this dvd for a while now and i reiterate my 5 star view. There is no tab book but I think its better insome ways because you follow Al Eck's lesson to get the licks slowly and when you're ready play Johnny doing each track and try to keep up or initially play rhythm with him. Attempting to play along with Johnny on screen is brilliant.,1249430400,12,348,4.057971014492754
