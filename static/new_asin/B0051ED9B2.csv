4521453,5,B0051ED9B2,"Being a huge Everyone Loves Raymond fan, I was excited to see this film when it was released in theaters. I would not call this film a documentary as it really is so much more then that. Trying to watch the transformation of an American sitcom for the Russian audience is riveting to watch. In fact, i could see it as a complementary weekly TV show.  There is so much personality in this film you instantly will fall in love with Phil and his parents! This film is definitely worth the purchase.",1311897600,,495,4.380434782608695
4521454,4,B0051ED9B2,"First off, I need to admit that I've never watched a full episode of the TV series ""Everyone Loves Raymond"", starring Ray Romano. But I love entertainment documentaries and, since the press releases said that you didn't need to be a regular ELR fan to enjoy this film, I approached it from that angle.

Phil Rosenthal is the creator - and original scriptwriter and Director - of ELR. After the show became a success for Sony TV Productions, the studio got a call from the Russian TV network. Russian versions of both ""The Nanny"" and ""Who's The Boss"" were a huge success - with new episodes using adapted U.S. scripts performed in Russian by Russian actors. So they wanted to try ELR. Rosenthal was sent to Russia to accomplish this and decided to bring along a camera crew to document the process. Things didn't go quite like it was planned and - as you will see in this 85-minute film - it wasn't just the language that was different; it was a cultural difference as well.

Rosenthal narrates the film to hold it together. We first meet his parents, who formed the basis for the parents in ELR played by Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts. They are funny and their appearances provided some of the best laughs. The situations used in the episodes were always based on real life experiences from both Rosenthal and Romano. So off we go to Russia to cast the show. This wasn't easy because of Russian actors only work part of the day. And there are certain cultural icons that just don't translate. I won't give away too much of the plot, because that's where the fun lies. But, eventually they succeed is getting the show exported. That is obvious because - in a clever move in DVD packaging - the DVD contains two U.S. ELR episodes and their Russian equivalent (with subtitles of course). My recommendation is to watch each U.S. version first and then the Russian one.

The film itself can drag in spots but - like ELR itself - there are some very funny moments that sneak up on you. Rosenthal has a droll sense of timing - not unlike Larry David - and there is an obvious Jewish comedian style to his delivery. (You get to see how he inherited this from his father in the one-minute ""Restaurant Joke"" told by his dad from the ""Old Jews Telling Jokes"" series, included as another bonus.  There is a full-length commentary on the film by Rosenthal, but I haven't listened to that. (After all, the film itself is a Rosenthal commentary!). There are also 11 minutes of deleted scenes.

For longtime fans of ELR, this is a must see. For those, like me, who never experienced ELR on TV, it serves as an intro to the series (I may seek it out in reruns) as well as an entertaining documentary on trying to cross, not only, language borders, but cultural ones as well.

4521464,1,B0051ED9B2,"I have heard great things about this title and on a whim decided to see if it was offered on Amazon Instant Video.  Exporting Raymond showed up on April 18, 2014 as an instant video option for $9.99.

After purchasing it with One-Click and being charged for the right to view it, my boyfriend and I discovered that in fact this title was not eligible for instant streaming.  The page did however say that it was available to download.

Further poking around yielded that the movie could not be downloaded to a Mac, our preferred platform, but rather could be downloaded and viewed via AmazonUnbox Player on Windows.  At this point, our evening wasting away, we switched to a selection on NetFlix.

So, luckily having a Windows machine as well, last night we downloaded Amazon Unbox on Windows 7.  Initially we confirmed that indeed my credit card had been charged for Exporting Raymond on Order D01-7124871-1480220, which was frustrating to locate given the order details seemed to appear and disappear at will.

Exporting Raymond does not show up in My Video Library>Purchases, except when it does.  Perhaps it is not available now, but the system still sells it?

So, AmazonUnbox.  Successfully installed.  Logged into my account.  My video library shows up in the right side panel.  Exporting Raymond is there with it's tantalizing cover art.  Clicked upon, the left panel populates with the title, runtime (86min.), and the inviting ""Download"" button.  We click it and immediately the left panel shows ""Preparing to Download"" under the Exporting Raymond icon.  Roll over the box with the mouse and it changes right back to ""Not Downloaded"".

We click one of my other purchases, Disney's ""Frozen"".  Contrary to the title, ""Frozen"" begins to thaw in the upper panel, downloading like a champ.  Immense frustration!

Today, after copious clicking around the Amazon universe, I have yet to find a direct way to ask for a refund, technical assistance, or even a simple email address to express my dismay at being charged for the convenience of being taunted by a system that obviously still is not ready for prime time.  I have screenshots of the order details.  I would love to watch this documentary.  If that is not possible, I want a refund.

We have the $9.99 fee, 3 hours and 15 minutes of troubleshooting, research and composition of this review/complaint at the professional rate of $25/hr, and unquantifiable mental anguish which brings us to a a total of $91.24.  Bitcoins are acceptable as are all major credit cards.  Jk, sort of.

I will step off my soapbox now.  Rant over.  Caveat Emptor.  I do enjoy Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video when it works.  Seems there is a glitch in the Matrix...",1399075200,,2709,4.8599562363238515

Also, Rosenthal seems bewildered that other countries don't attempt to make their men into lapdogs like here in America.  That being said, Rosenthal, coming off as being condescending, also is a good writer and cares about his show enough to fight for it to be done right.  His frustrations are understandable.

4521471,1,B0051ED9B2,"""feckless"": ""weak, ineffective, worthless, irresponsible "". The Russians patiently try to explain that Russian men are not wussy Woody Allen spin offs ( plagiarizers). That ""Raymond"" turns out to be an autobiographical display of the emascualted, ""non threatening"" male is appalling and disgusting to both the men and the women of Russia. In the end, the show becomes a success in Russia - but not for the reasons, Phil thinks it is..it is a way to portray Americans as putrified by our emphasis on material obsessions, and beaten into submission by the more ""sensible and highly evolved american female""...the purpose being to more thoroughly control the male and steer him towards the material success and largesse that Amercan women demand. In other words, a neutered/non sexual Mule to pull their carriage. In the end, it is a success in Russia because it makes clown bagatelles out of Americans in general, and perhaps Jews in particular. I am embarrassed by this misquided attempt to ""educate Russians""...( Phil takes full advantage to mock and ridicule the Russians, their ""ways and means"", and in particular their deplorable, outdated, pathetic excuse for a studio, and backward, ignorant methodology ...in a word, he starts out making Russians an object of ridicule ). Because ( the show ) ""Raymond"" and his ridiculous family of ""clowns spilling from a clown car"" is the russians having a good mocking laugh at America...so Phil is no genious; just an irritating dweeb...and has made America an object of ridicule in the process of his self congratulatory reportage.

I recommend Phil aquaint himself with some real comedy and socio/political polemics as in ""Mic Macs"". Here is real artistry, genius,cinematography, script writing, and directing. Let's leave the ""all in the family/meathead' shtuck behind, as we did with ""Happy Days"", which we are not really interested in ever seeing again...let's do something with that fame and money, Phil. And loose the son of Woody s _ _ _ behind. Do something meaningful..and stop mocking every cultural and racial group as inferior to...uh...

4521474,3,B0051ED9B2,"Sometime after ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" went off the air in America, series creator Phil Rosenthal was asked to help with a Russian version that would be called ""Everybody Loves Kostya.""  This is a documentary Rosenthal shot about that journey.  The big (and sometimes funny) thing is that there are cultural differences between the two countries...duh.

Rosenthal is intent on transferring American values and his idea of what is funny, to the Muscovites whether they like it or not.  From my perspective his intuition and insights are correct, but the Russian television industry is slow to accept them.  Some of the best scenes are actually when Rosenthal interacts with the regular people.  He becomes fond of his driver/bodyguard who may or may not have a serious health issue.  There is also a cute scene when Rosenthal visits one of the producer's home for dinner.  The extended Russian's family is there including both sets of in-laws.  Eventually they hook up with Rosenthal's parents via Skype.  Some things are the same.  Interestingly enough Rosenthal spends little time talking about or reminiscing about his young female translator who is with him constantly.  What's that all about?  Ultimately this is a vanity production that would have been better served as a segment on ""60 Minutes.""

The Blu ray is a 1080p transfer with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Different video components are used in the making of the film, so there are variances in the quality of the video.  Nothing is objectionable or distracting.  The audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and again, it's fine but it's a documentary about making a TV show, so there's not much going on in the extra channels.",1333670400,2,1670,4.971119133574007
4521475,4,B0051ED9B2,"I don't watch a lot of documentaries, but I do like Everybody Loves Raymond and was interested by the premise of this one, and boy am I glad I watched it. Anyone familiar with the show can immediately identify the similaries between Rosenthal and the character of Raymond, and the similarities between his parents and Frank and Marie on the show. But the real pricelessness is Rosenthal's bewildered humor as he discovers just how different cultures and mindsets can be as he tries to translate the sitcom for a Russian audience while still maintaing the integrity of the show. He encounters many roadblocks and confrontations over the most minute issues (e.g., the designer wants Debra to dress in fashionable clothes all the time, and Rosenthal struggles to explain that no housewife would wear an evening gown while cleaning the house -- and this nonsensical debate continues for a long time!). Throughout it all, Rosenthal is relatable and brings us along on this outlandish journey. Part culture study, part fish-out-of-water story, part just plain hysterical circumstances, this is a great one to watch!",1329868800,,1109,5.0989010989010985
4521476,1,B0051ED9B2,"I must say that the cultural differences are fascinating!!!  From that perspective, this film is very interesting.  On the other hand, Phil Rosenthal is so INCREDIBLY condescending and annoying, that this is a difficult film to watch.  To be fair, I should mention that I find the American version of this show equally annoying.....almost as much as the creator.  I agree with the Russians that this is simply not a good show.  If we're going to export comedy, why not something that has more layers of comedy or even simply more less stupid....""The Simpsons"" comes to mind as something that, while not as good as it used to be, is still very smart.  How about something like ""The Office"" or ""Arrested Development"" or ""Archer"" or ""Friends"" or ""Big Bang"" or classics like ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Star Trek"" or ""Twilight Zone""........or a test pattern.  It's embarrassing that a show this bad is being exported, and that the idiot culpable had the nerve to treat the Russians with such condescension. What an embarrassment.",1329609600,3,1015,4.866279069767442
4521477,4,B0051ED9B2,"Comedy is always a challenge in your own language much less another language. This documentary about the attempt to create a Russian counterpart to ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" by Phillip Rosenthal is a fascinating and amusing glimpse into how cultural and comedy don't always translate well.

Along the way Phil learns a bit about himself, so does the cast and crew. Collaboration between unwilling partners is always a touchy business especially if you feel that the person brought in to help create a show is telling you how it hsould work in YOUR culture. It takes Phil a little while to figure out that while the show is his he has to somehow let go of his preconception of what the show SHOULD be about and still allow the Russian writers to make it about themselves.

Initially it appears that Phil and the writers/director/cast just don't connect. It's like putting together two builders with different blueprints working on the same house.

Comedy isn't always universal. Surprisingly the show works after they eliminate certain people who don't appear to understand comedy.

This is a very enjoyable comic documentary the only disappointment I felt was with the special features--Phil provides the commentary track and, really, he isn't able to give us any more insight beyond what he provides in the movie itself. The contrast between the American version and the Russian version of the show is a bit instructive but we kind of get the jist of that from watching the documentary. It's still kind of interesting although comparing the pilot vs. later episodes of the series might have been a bit more interesting.

We get deleted scenes as well as a short ""Jews Telling Jokes"" where Phil's dad gets to be center stage.

""Exporting Raymond"" is a rather wry comic documentary. The end credits includes footage that didn't make the movie including a scene of Ray Romano star of the original series which is amusing as well.",1329609600,,1927,4.913846153846154

have an entirely different work ethic than Americans.

Philip Rosenthal is just naturally funny and his self deprecation in a machismo society makes him even better.

4521480,4,B0051ED9B2,"Fascinating and humorous peek into the global business of comedy, the working heart of the tv sitcom ""Everyone Loves Raymond"", and the tangled world of Russia and her people.

Phil Rosenthal was the man behind the scenes, head writer and chief architect for what became a weekly institution for millions of fans. And in 2010, he was offered the chance to sit down and advise Russian television on their version of the show - 'Everyone Loves Kostya'. What makes this so engaging, not having seen Phil before in real life, is just how much he *is* Raymond. That Romano the actor and Phil the writer are mutual halves of the same person; his emotional reactions, facial expressions, sense of timing are the very embodiment of the television character they humourously delivered to the small screen.

But this wouldn't be nearly as entertaining if it were such a simple project. Far from it. And the dark, cold and rainy night that greets him as he arrives in Moscow is the harbinger of many similar days to come.

Our first glimpse of 'this-might-not-work' arrives in the form of the Costume Designer. She's never seen the show. And her desire is to display the cast in the very best haute couture. Phil is stymied and concerned as he attempts to explain that these characters need to be average people with average looks wearing average clothes. This information not only falls on deaf ears, but in fact offends her and her diva sensibilities.

Oh boy.

Next is the Head Writer. In addition to not seeing the show, is unmarried. And he honestly cannot understand why the Raymond character appears to be, from his bachelor perspective, a wimp. In fact, he visualizes a new and improved Raymond: A man of strength, of machismo, and the New Russia. His very first viewing of the American-version leaves him unimpressed and not surprisingly - angry. He doesn't like Raymond.

This is not going well.

From there things increasingly spiral towards ever more bizarre encounters with absent staff, morphing cast and miscasts, and varying levels of studio executives. It's then that Phil has a creeping realization: He has stepped into Bizarro World. A mirrored reflection of our existence; a world where Superman seeks out destruction and creates mayhem. And in this world floats suggestions that Raymond, a.k.a. Kostya, should be a muscle-bound bricklayer who doesn't take crap from any person, much less a pair of women. Again: The initial director, writers, and crew have never seen the show.

In an attempt to reach out and understand the Russian perspective, Phil decides to hit the streets to ask average citizens their thoughts. Considering the Russian people have lived under three generations of pure paranoia - not exactly the environment to seek open and frank discussions with random strangers.

He then attempts a guided tour given by the Costume Designer. It's explained to him that the base, most instinctual crass commercialism is what sells there. To illustrate his point, Phil devolves the production. Utilizing the same visual graphics and editing for the most horrendously pathetic programming we have in the states: Utterly worthless incarnations of 'The Real Housewives', all synched to the thumping overbearing beat of Britany Spears. Yikes.

There are many amusing fish-out-of-water moments. But equally there are excruciating tension-filled scenes as heart-felt frustration is poured onto the screen; each side trying to explain, and by explain I mean ""correct"", the other's mentality. 'Exporting' isn't a straight-comedic documentary in that sense. Increasingly, it feels more like the Motherland's favorite pastime: Chess. A game where conflicting positions are quiet battlefields; move and counter-move, blindside tactics employed to overwhelm and conquer the opponent. Phil quickly realizes that Russia is not the ideal environment for creative cooperation.

And being fair and balanced, he allows us a glimpse of the ""Overbearing Creator"" - his own unrelenting sense of divine understanding for his baby. Putting on display his inability and unwillingness to 'let go', to acknowledge that his creation was now in the hands of others. Hilariously, Phil, who is so keenly self-aware, doesn't see this when in the moment. But I'm grateful that as the Director, he did. Made more humorous when marrying The Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy to his agitated gesticulations and blossoming unwanted input; we get to see the other side of the table. Those poor Russians. Especially the director. Who, after a time, will no longer make eye contact with the Guiding Spirit; having had enough ""advice"" from the Amerikanski.

Ultimately, over the course of nearly a year, things slowly progress.

The film ends with this enjoyable tag: 'Everyone Loves Kotsya' is the Number 1 ranked show in Russia. They're ordering scripts for one hundred more episodes. And Poland has just called the production company - they love the idea of having a Polish 'Everyone Loves' to be filmed in their country. {:-D",1315008000,8,5002,5.1302211302211305

4521482,5,B0051ED9B2,"It's rare and wondrous when a film manages to not only entertain but educate. ""Exporting Raymond,"" is at once, a comedic tour de force, an inside view into a culture we were at a time obsessed with, yet know so little about, and even more, at it's core, it's a loving, moving, reverent look at family. Who better to take us there than Everybody Loves Raymond's, Phil Rosenthal?

Rosenthal shares his process of trying to facilitate the translation of his hugely successful, very American sitcom, into a colorless, humorless culture, where the focus is appearance and pecking order, over substance and talent. All the elements are available, but structure and inflexibility create a subpar product that Phil could never, would never tolerate. The contrast of Rosenthal's ongoing brilliant expose of the human condition with this superficial and awkward counterpart is stunning.

""Exporting Raymond"" documents Rosenthal's journey through the frigid and grey Russia so effectively, I was chilled to the bone sitting in a toasty Los Angeles movie theatre watching it.  Bleak overseas footage is interspersed with Phil's over-the-top, vibrant folks back home in contrast. Rosenthal's unrelenting, persistent, respectful struggle to get the Russian's to raise the creative, truth-telling bar, and his loving acceptance and patience with his hysterical parents is the heart of this riveting, hilarious, insightful film.

Exporting Raymond's true brilliance shines brightest in allowing us to come to our own conclusions. Do yourself a favor, don't miss it.",1313280000,2,1549,5.441666666666666

Phil Rosenthal is one of the more genuine, endearing, and funny people I've had the pleasure of watching in a documentary. Not only is the film hilarious but there was a conspicuous arc to the piece. Phil entered his situation one way and came out the other end a man with a newer and deeper understanding of what it means to be positive and open-minded.

He has, in ""Exporting Raymond"", provided us with not only a treat but, yet again, a funny and wonderful ""tasting"" meal.  The gift here is a close up and personal look at the all too human experience of the Aritst that is not only funny but poignant.  A successful sit com finds a home in a very foreign country through the shear tenacity of its creator.  The journey starts with a simple introduction to Rosenthal through snapshots of his family and then continues slowly into a darker place with Writer's who at first don't get it, a wardrobe Mistress with her own style, to the very familiar ""suits"" (network executives) who seem to stare as if we were still in the midst of the Cold War. Poignancy is surprisingly presented by the relationship that Rosenthal develops with his Driver.  The humor is abundant but not as much as the two scenes with Rosenthal's parents who steal the show and get the big laughs.  This is not only worth buying but worth seeing more than once.

The television show that dominated ratings, won multiple awards from 1996 through 2005 and is based on the real-life experiences of actor Ray Romano and Rosenthal.

And for many popular series, they tend to receive adaptations for other countries.

So, right after the series ended, Sony's Russian division had wanted to make a Russian adaptation for the series titled ""Everybody Loves Kostya"" and what best than to showcase the making of a series overseas than to document it and it is what Phil Rosenthal did in ""Exporting Raymond"".

The film received multiple awards at various film festivals in 2010 and 2011 and now it will be released on Blu-ray on August 2, 2011 courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

The creator behind the popular sitcom was called into become a consultant for the Russian version and we watch as Phil Rosenthal is briefed by his American counterparts in Russia but quickly learns the differences between American and Russian culture.

For Rosenthal, his thinking is that the themes that made ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", the squabbles between husband and wife and families applies everywhere around the world.

But for Rosenthal, on his first day of meetings, he quickly learns that the Russians are having difficulty understanding him.  For one, the costume designer for the Russian adaptation wants to make the characters fashionable as Russia takes its pride from things looking stylish.  But for Rosenthal, because the sitcom takes place at home and not outdoors, there is no reason for the characters to be stylish.  And its the first conflict he has with the Russians.

The next meeting continues to show conflicts as the writers for the show have problems taking the American style and providing it for an Russian audience and the writers feel there needs to be a change.  Of course, Rosenthal doesn't see why the show needs to be changed.  The squabbles between husband wife is worldwide and there is comedy in that.  But of course, he feels that because his writers are young and single, they don't understand.

With Phil feeling a bit disheveled the longer he stays in Russia and people on the Russian side of the business not understanding or communicating with him, fortunately he finds people to confide in such as his Russian translator and his driver (a former soldier/bodyguard).

But what if Phil takes a different approach by trying to understand the Russian people and learning about the differences in their country versus how things were done in America.  Can he make it happen or will a Russian version of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" end up being a failure?

VIDEO:

""Exporting Raymond"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  It's important to note that the film was not created with a huge budget or big production.  It's shot in a documentary style format where it follows Phil Rosenthal and gives us a glimpse of his meetings and his time in Russia.  I get a feeling that present with Phil in Russia were probably one cameraman and one person recording audio.

But unlike a documentary, there is also a scene in a music video-esque style when Phil learns that Russia loves Britney Spears and then we see a montage with CG and stylish effects showing up around Rosenthal to the tune of Britney Spears' ""Toxic"".

Most of the video was shot during the cold winter and while there are some scenes where yellow and red tend to pop, picture quality is good for the most part considering the locations where he had to visit.  I didn't notice any artifacting or banding but for the most part, for this type of film, picture quality was very good.

Where PQ does make a difference for me was  the special features as we get to see two episodes each of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" as well as ""Everybody Loves Kostya"" in HD.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Exporting Raymond"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and its important to note that this film is primarily dialogue-based.  Granted, there are scenes with crowds which lend to the ambiance of the film but the only time where the sound becomes more punchy and sticks out is during the musical segment of Britney Spears ""Toxic"" playing.  But for the most part, a film such as ""Exporting Raymond"" is going to be front and center-channel driven and the lossless audio fits this film very well.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Exporting Raymond"" comes with the following special features:

  Commentary with Writer/Director Philip Rosenthal  - Audio commentary with writer/director Philip Rosenthal.  Audio commentary is hilarious but also gives us an idea of his thoughts of certain scenes and how he felt at the time and in retrospect.
  Deleted Scenes - (11:16) Featuring nine deleted scenes.
  Everybody Loves Kostya - Russian Episodes - Featuring two episodes ""Baggage"" and ""The Family Bed"" of ""Everybody Loves Kostya"" presented in HD and in Russian with English subtitles.
  Everybody Loves Raymond - American Episodes - Featuring two episodes ""Baggage"" and ""The Family Bed"" of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" presented in HD.
  Old Jews Telling Jokes: ""Restaurant"" By Max Rosenthal  - (1:15) Featuring Max Rosenthal telling a joke.
  Theatrical Trailer - (2:26) Featuring the original theatrical trailer of ""Exporting Raymond"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was a big fan of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and the thought of seeing a Russian adaptation of the series definitely piqued my interest.  But most importantly, the trailer alone and seeing a taste of the challenges that series creator/writer Phil Rosenthal had to face definitely made me want to see this film!

It was good to see how American adaptation of shows such as ""My Dream of Jeannie"" and ""The Nannie"" doing so well in Russia. But adaptations from one country to the other is a hit or miss.

For example, BBC had ""Coupling"", when it aired on BBC, I was raving about this series and when it was announced that an American adaptation would be made.  At first I was skeptical but I figured, can a show about sex make it in America? And sure enough it flopped, meanwhile another show that aired around the same time in the UK titled ""The Office"" did magnificent in America.

So, sitcom adaptations are tricky and when ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", a series that is about family dynamics, makes sense to us in the U.S., in other countries, the comedy may fly over the head of a person.

So, take for example the argument about the fashion that Rosenthal had to understand.  Why is the leading lady not dressed up?  Rosenthal argues that most people don't dressup in their home and his argument is valid as I have known more than enough women who rather wear sweats or shorts than being decked out in expensive clothing here in America.

But in the opposite spectrum, I have known women in Japan to France who do dress up daily even at home.  Where the leading lady of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is a wife and hardworking mother, we know the character of Debra who doesn't let Raymond walk over her.  She is vocally strong and doesn't let the husband get away with things...while in other cultures, the men are the boss of the house and women just listen and show no independence.

And thus, the cultural conflicts that do come into play.

Personally, I am not a Russian verite when it comes to pop culture but watching ""Exporting Raymond"", I had a chance to see how things operate in the country.  Writers, directors and crew are not focusing on one show, they have multiple shows to work on.  So, that is one surprising factor where I can see communication especially from an outsider, a foreigner, an American coming into a country and telling Russians how things should be.  Sure, Phil Rosenthal is the creator of the series, so its important to hear him lend his consulting advice to the Russian directors and writers and other crew.

But while watching this film, I was surprised to hear about the difficulty when it came to getting permission of hiring an actor to other nuances that are on both side of the spectrum.  Adaptation of one series for another country is never easy.  Sometimes things come out quite differently in the end (which are quite evident in film adaptations from popular films from other countries given a Hollywood approach).

""Exporting Raymond"" is a film that I absolutely enjoyed because we learn about the journey that Rosenthal had to experience.  If you love ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", you understand how he feels when the Russians want to make things different.  But even cultural differences aside, Rosenthal knows what is funny, what makes him laugh and can tell when it doesn't work.  He doesn't have to be Russian and he knows it, his American contacts from Sony in Russia know it but because things are done differently, you have to accept how things are and put a smile on your face and let them run with it.

But as for the Blu-ray release, this is where my appreciation for this film comes into place.  Sure, the PQ and AQ are very good but considering this is not a big-budget Hollywood film but a film that is documentary-like, I was quite pleased with the over quality.  But what I was even more pleased was the inclusion of two episodes of the Russian version of the series titled ""Everybody Loves Kostya"" (with English subtitles) and sure enough, I enjoyed them!

Sure, there are differences but there are also similarities between the US and Russian version of the series but I was quite pleased to see that the casting of the Russian adaptation actually worked (because in the film, casting was quite literally a pain in the ass) in the end.

And of course, for comparison, we also get two episodes from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" so one can compare the ""Baggage"" and ""The Family Bed Episodes"" of both the US and Russian versions.  But also, if you are a fan of the series, getting a chance to see ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" on Blu-ray and makes you wonder, if a series can look this much better than its DVD counterpart, then by all means, I'm ready to upgrade a lot of my TV series to HD because it looked very good on Blu-ray!

Also, there are a good number of special features included, especially the audio commentary which is worth listening to. But for any fan of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", for me it was a huge plus to have the two Russian episodes included.  That was wonderful!

Overall, ""Exporting Raymond"" shows us how adaptation of a series can be complicated for both parties.

Cultural differences definitely makes things more difficult but what Rosenthal was trying to drive into the minds of his Russian counterparts that by the end of the day, there are family issues that can be seen as funny.  Issues between husband and wife can be funny especially if you are living in another country.  While communicating that may not be easy, in the end, especially in this case of ""Everbody Loves Kostya"", it all came in place, especially since the Russian adaptation has become the #1 series in Russia and other countries may be interested in doing their version as well.

If you enjoyed ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and the work of Phil Rosenthal and want to see the journey he had to take to Russia and the challenges he endured but to watch and also laugh, you can't go wrong with ""Exporting Raymond"".  Witty, fun and highly enjoyable, this one is a worth watching!",1312243200,3,11414,4.802254098360656

This clash is conveyed honestly and skillfully and that's what makes Exporting Raymond so hilarious and enjoyable to watch.  i feel i've been to Moscow and back and only paid the price of a movie ticket.",1311897600,2,737,4.477611940298507

But I was certainly aware of it in terms of something floating around in the cultural zeitgeist.  And a number of years ago I had an opportunity to meet Patricia Heaton in person, so lovely and charming.  But never Ray Romano, and certainly not the show's creator Phil Rosenthal.  The documentary about Phil going to Moscow to help create a version of the show in Russian with Russian actors is a full on dose of Ray and Phil and all the side-splitting who-can't-relate jokes and schtick about families, and relationships, and people ... delivered directly into the grim un-smiling faces of scary looking guys in badly lit production offices just waiting for Phil to cut the un-funny (to them) stuff so they can get on with making real comedy and downing some more vodka.
