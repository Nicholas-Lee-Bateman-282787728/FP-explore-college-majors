8358999,5,B002A5ZM6A,"Not only do you get to hear Bill Evans play live, but you get to hear his take on performing in general.  This trio is way up there with the Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian ""Dream"" trio.  The selections are quintessential Evans tunes.  Even better, is the additional ""Universal Mind of Bill Evans.""  It has the only recording of ""My Bells"" on solo piano.  What a gem!  So glad to own it!",1344470400,,384,4.263888888888889
