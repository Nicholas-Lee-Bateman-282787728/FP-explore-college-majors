541617,5,6303052630,"Somewhat gruesome, but so life like. My favourite western movie, it offers everything, the costumes, the settings, the story and awesome attention to details. To me it rates right along with other movies... 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Dr Chivago.'",1183939200,,245,5.15
541618,4,6303052630,"This gives you all you want in a western; guns, fights, dirty cowboys, a bank heist, ambushes, wide open scenery and awesome wild horse rides all with a high body count (almost every single character dies).  However real the tough terrain is (I felt like I was there on the dusty planes, riding a horse) the story is at times unbelievable. The sometimes problem is Mickey Rourke, who does not come close to ruining the movie, but somehow over-acts and under-acts at the same time. Rourke plays it too aloof almost detached from the entire movie. I wish he had more fire or creative quirks. Rather he just stands there, whispering menacing things without clear motives. When he is in action, he seems kinda slow and too deliberate. Overall Rourke does not appear ""cowboy"". His goth/pirate wardrobe and make-up do become distracting.
But a strong cast (unfortunately I don't recall one female in this movie),strong directing, great horse rides and inspired scenery saves a script with some holes and a slow motion outlaw played by Rourke.",1161043200,3,1036,4.886363636363637
541619,3,6303052630,"This seemed like a sure-fire hit, and it could have been, except for two things:
Rourke's makeup and costumes are almost laughable. The stupid mustache, the big, floppy hat, and ten layers of clothes in the hot summer plains are ridiculous! The makeup and costume guys should be selling used cars.
Second, the final scene was ludicrously short, bloodless, and unbelievable, especially given the bloody action that proceeded it. Someone please explain to the man who directed this film about the velocity and deadliness of small handguns.
Still, it's worth watching just for Rourke and Mulroney. Rourke is THE quintessential bad guy, and he plays it to the hilt, here. Muldoney is always good, no matter what role he plays. The supporting cast is great, too, so it's not a complete wash-out!",1073174400,5,790,4.992424242424242
541620,5,6303052630,Mickey Rourke is the best I've ever seen him in this film. He is cruel and ruthless to the core. He makes Clint Eastwoods noname caracter seem rather friendly. If you are a fan of violent westerns with a heartless main character this is the one for you.,1067558400,3,253,4.291666666666667
541621,4,6303052630,"This is a damn good movie.  The story's awesome and Rourke's character is a badass.  It drags in some spots, but overall this is probably the coolest western since TOMBSTONE.  The stylized direction by Geoff Murphy(YOUNG GUNS 2) is real effective. Check this one out.",1028246400,2,267,4.888888888888889
541622,2,6303052630,"An interesting idea is put through the Western ringer and comes out soaked in blood. A band of bank robbers barely escape after a muddled attempt. They kill their psychotic leader, and continue on. The leader lives, and joins the very posse hunting down the robbers. He takes his bloody revenge on his old gang one by one, until just his former second in command is left.
What a great idea. Reading the back of the video box, I thought this would really play with your mind. Then I watched the movie...
Mickey Rourke, thanks to his facial hair scheme and boxer's eyes, looks like an Old West version of Fu Manchu. His southern accent is constantly dubbed in, since he mutters through this more than Marlon Brando in ""The Godfather."" Rourke plays the robbery gang's leader left for dead as a psychotic. It takes the rest of the posse forever to discover this fact as he gets most of them killed. There are no smart scenes where the posse does not know he is a robber, like I thought there might be. Instead, after killing the marshall and the bank president, he is made head of the posse, since the other posse members are too stupid to see his murderous ways.
Dermot Mulroney, who has never been good in a film, is good here. He plays the second in command a little to sensitively, but he is a likeable hero. Ted Levine is also good as a shoot now, ask later moron who is with the gang.
The robbers are nothing more than stereotypes. Mulroney is the good guy. Levine is dumb. John C. McGinley is the coward. Keith David, because he is black, practices voodoo and is convinced Rourke is a ghost. Steve Buscemi is the dreamer, who is talking about his little home on the beach in Mexico he hopes to have one day right before having his head blown off by Rourke. Loomis (the character's name) is the injured guy they will eventually sacrifice. Rourke is psychotic just because. The posse's marshall is a he-man who is killed way too early. The bank president is nerdy and bespectacled, and also killed in an outlandish way.
The constant blood and shootings are exhausting. The whole film is just a bunch of guys riding around in the desert getting shot. The opening bank robbery, reminiscent of ""The Wild Bunch,"" is handled well enough, but screenwriter Eric Red never gives us any characters, just warm bodies full of blood. Why does this robbery go wrong after 29 went right? Why does Rourke pick this robbery to go mental and get ""killed"" by his own men? How did the posse know the bank was going to be robbed? After the opening credits, you feel like you just walked into the middle of the film, not the beginning. These professional bank robbers and cold blooded posse members also spend most of the film fighting amongst themselves, and bickering in a way that made me think of my son's daycare class.
The final mistake here is having Mulroney narrate the film. Since Eric Red is no Billy Wilder, Mulroney obviously lives through the film, meaning he probably defeats Rourke in the finale. I sat through 90 minutes of bloodshed to witness a showdown that I had already figured out in the first ten minutes.
While not an utter failure, ""The Last Outlaw"" does not have enough going for it to be recommended.
This was rated (R) for physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, strong profanity, and sexual references.",1022112000,7,3325,4.5711892797319935

Now, we know that there were very few toothbrushes in the Old West. So when I watched two of the actors (who are excellent at their trade), I paid attention. Ted Levine (from Monk) was a scruffy, bearded, dirty old bandit. His teeth were stained (when you could see them through the beard/mustache), one possibly broken. Steve Buscemi, whose teeth are naturally crooked also stained his teeth for the part. They were the two true old west outlaws. The rest were good but their teeth were much too white to have been out in the desert for weeks.",1479081600,,700,4.4609375

Complaints I have read in other reviews generally revolve around the plot twist of Mickey's character, Col. Gaff, going from the leader of the outlaw gang to the head of the posse.  Yes, it seems like a hard pill to swallow, however, in defense of this particular plot twist I would say that it is setup slowly and it is really the only place where suspension of disbelief is required.

The main character was so deeply flawed and consumed with hatred for the Union that his actions were acceptable (to him)  Mickey Rourke was excellent in this role.  The other characters were well fleshed out and the scenes were superbly set with great locations to shoot from.  The story was not predicatable and the entire thing wrapped up at the end.  In some ways this was a 1950's ""oater"" but with a great deal of updating.  I started watching this to kill a bit of time but fell into the story rather quickly.

The dialogue is terrible all the way to the forced gritty voices they use to sound tough.  There is an underlying message to the movie that in order to lead, you have to be tough.  The main character never really gets it though.  He has flashbacks about it but it never really takes hold.

Spoiler:  the way the posse allows the main villain, who one minute they all want to kill and the next minute they allow him to take over as their leader and hand him a bunch of guns, is also pretty unbelievable and cheesy.  Add to this the main character who is being hunted by the villain has a drink in a saloon with him and gets advice- during the hunt mind you, is just...again, cheesy!

544256,2,6303052630,"The story is idiotic.  The posse puts the leader of the outlaw gang in charge of tracking the gang after his gang had left him for dead.  He recovers from his wounds as though he had never been shot and proceeds to hunt down and pick off the gang members one by one.  In the final confrontation Rourke holds his pistol to the throat of his former lieutenant, seems to be getting ready to kiss him, cocks his pistol, and then when the lieutenant pulls out a derringer and cocks it, stands there like an idiot until he gets shot.
The scenery is beautiful but that is about it.  The story is supposed to be set in 1873, yet at least half of the pistols shown were Colt Single Action Army revolvers, which did not begin production until 1873 and were mostly sold to the government. The chances of most of the gang members and posse using them would be about zero.  They may as well have shown them using Glocks.  And the characters are always busy counting bullets, as though that was a clever plot twist.  At that time period, people were more more likely to use the correct term cartridge.
This is a pathetic example of a western.  If you are looking for a much better western watch Open Range.",1465689600,2,1192,4.337837837837838

be his best performances ever... As a ""Western"",,, it's a flop,,,  extremely silly screenplay... Nonsensical... That
 being said, great cinematography, lousy horsemanship, but it l ends up entertaining... It's kind of like watching
a train wreck,,, LIVE.. If you like ""Westerns"",,, stick with ""Lonesome Dove"", ""Broken Trail"",  ""Open Range"", or
reruns of ""Gunsmoke""... Historically, this movie has no redeeming value, other than maybe a slight portrayal
of ""Bloody Bill Anderson""...
If you take the epic ""Lonesome Dove"", other than it's time line, it's based on logical and historical facts...
""The Last Outlaw"",,, is so ""Outlandish"",,, it ends up to be quite entertaining...

544938,5,6303052630,"Charismatic leader.  Gang with blind loyalty.  High action bank robbery.  Betrayal.  Revenge.  Classic Western fare.

The Last Outlaw has a stellar cast, Mickey Rourke (Graf), Durmot Mulroney (Eustis), Ted Levine (Potts), Steve Buscemi (Philo), and Keith David (Lovecraft) along with some other familiar faces, makes for a very well acted presentation.  The writing is very good as well as the directing.

I always liked Mickey Rourke's character portrayals, and always been fans of Buscemi, Levine, David and Mulroney so I figured I couldn't go wrong.  I was right.  This is a very good western that is well deserving of a five.  The only improvement possible would have been more, liked it enough that I wish it had kept on going.  Brief summary;

Former Confederate commander Graf heads a gang of thieves.  What he says goes.  His men follow blindly until....... well, something happens as a result of a bank robbery and his men turn.  That doesn't sit well and Graf seeks revenge by slightly unorthodox means.  Good action, progresses well, very believable.  Liked Ted Levine's character, he added much.

This is a good one you will watch repeatedly.  Add it to your collection if you like top notch westerns.",1349136000,3,1213,5.0

545005,5,6303052630,"No, by spaghetti western, I don't mean the zany ones.  I mean the brutal, dirty ones that introduced America to a revisionist west that was uglier than the Zane Gray fantasies, such as the Django series, Lee Van Clief's movies, and the Leone films that started it all.

Mickey Rourke is effective as a sadistic, almost reptilian leader of a gang of ex-confederate raiders-turned-bank robbers.  When his brutality goes too far even for his own gang to stomache, he is shot and left for dead.  A posse hunting the gang finds him and is about to execute him when he makes a deal with them to track down his own gang, much against the better judgement of the sheriff who thinks it a bargain with the devil.  The sheriff's reservations about the deal prove to be well-founded;  As Rourke's character helps to track down and murder his ex-fellows one at a time, he slowly starts to gain control of the weak-minded members of the posse until, by the climax of the film, they have killed off the reputable members of the posse and in effect become his new gang.

The film maintains a good, steady pace with no distracting sub-plots to slow the story.  Violent and un-sentimental, this movie may not be for everyone.  One interesting character is a black ex-confederate soldier/gang member (yes, the south had their own black soldiers even though hollywood wouldn't want you to know that).  Though the PC crowd might find this character's voodoo predictions as steretypical, bear in mind that southerners were (and still are) superstitious in general, and in the film, the other gang members hang on this character's every prediction as meaningful.

This was a made-for-HBO production filmed around 1990, but the picture quality is unusually sharp, more so than most new movies on DVD today as it appears to have been published in ED or ""Enhanced Definition"".  Though not as sharp as HD, it is a way to fit more visual information onto the disc while maintaining the regular DVD format so it will play on any DVD player.  If a lesser known feature such as this can be put out in ED, why can't they make all DVDs this way, especially some of these big-budget features they hype about so much?

At any rate, this is one of my all-time favorite westerns, and I'm glad to see that in this one instance, the studio did it justice.",1254096000,2,2316,4.658476658476658

7835639,3,6303052630,"Slow moving, and tons of ""guys riding on horses"" scenes, many of which I fast forwarded.  I started to watch this for Rourke but stayed for Mulroney.  It's really more Mulroney's movie than Rourke's anyway and I didn't like Mickey in this (he looks really weird, his part is small and one-dimensional).  Mulroney is much more interesting to watch in this, he's so handsome and his character has more depth than Rourke's.
Overall, I wasn't too enthralled w/ the show, but did watch it to the end. I'm glad it ended the way it did.
Worth a watch if you are a Dermot Mulroney fan more than anything.",1518307200,,596,4.5
