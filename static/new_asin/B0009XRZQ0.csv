2334897,2,B0009XRZQ0,"Televisa makes it very difficult for me to take them seriously when they release chopped up versions of their best telenovelas in one disappointing DVD box set.  I'm not a big fan of most of their contemporary telenovelas (especially their recent ones), but I love their period pieces and costume dramas and La Artorcha Encendida (The Lit Torch -- it has a better ring to it in Spanish) is right up there in quality and romance as Amor Real (Real Love), Corazon Salvaje (Savage Heart), Ramona, Yo Compro Esa Mujer (I Shall Buy that Woman) and Alborada (Break of Dawn) -- the latter of which is currently on the air here in the US.  I loved watching this intense love story set against the backdrop of the Mexican war for independence in early nineteenth century starring a younger Leticia Calderon, Ernesto Laguardia and Humberto Zurita (who was brilliant as a villain in his most recent period piece called Los Plateados).  I also got to see other heavyweights like Enrique Rocha, Carmen Salinas and Juan Ferrara.  The brilliant Christian Bach is also featured in this telenovela, but most of her scenes must have been cut off or something because she scarcely appears in this DVD.  The scenes are choppy and uneven, the music score is different from the one I remember when it aired on Univision and, if you can believe it, the ending is cut off.  We are left high and dry when it comes to knowing what happens to the villains.  All in all, this has got to be the worst DVD box set Televisa has ever released.  I give five stars to the actual serialized novel because it is one of the best stories I have seen, but I give one star to the actual DVD.  I'll be very wary of picking up DVD sets from the popular Mexican production company next time. I hope they will release unabridged or better edited box sets in the future because I like the idea of owning my favorite telenovelas.",1137888000,52,1883,4.530973451327434
2334898,4,B0009XRZQ0,The final CD did not have the ending for the story.  I found it odd that no credits were shown either.  After investing so much time viewing the story needless to say I was a bit upset.  I did email the address listed on the DVD box and I am waiting to see if I get a response.  Otherwise the story is great and was really enjoying it until the incomplete ending.,1135728000,29,363,4.0
2334899,4,B0009XRZQ0,"Nice novela, however it apppears that it has been chopped down

to fit into 24 hours or so.

I must say that I DID NOT BUY my set from  AMAZON.

One big problem with my set is that the final disk #4 ends

without the END, Even though I get the drift of how independence

is achieved, I never get to see what happens to the 2 MOST DESPICABLE characters in this novela PEDRO and LUIS.

I wonder if other people who have this DVD set have the same probledm, Also the actress CHRISTIAN BACH, who is widely advertised, onlly appears for about 5 minutes out of 24 hours.

Again a nice novela, but with my set, NO ENDING.",1135555200,34,614,4.100840336134453
2334910,2,B0009XRZQ0,"I did not have the chance to watch this great production when it was telecasted.  I could had never imagine that Televisa would have done something like this....an unfinished series...it is a shame that they did not finish the work.
What is even worst is that they have the courage to sell it.  Maybe Amazon should protect the customers and don't have it available for sell or have a disclamour that let people like me know that this novela has an inconclusive ending.",1195776000,4,468,4.626506024096385
2334911,1,B0009XRZQ0,"Es una lastima que una novela como esta,con tan buenos actores y actrices en su reparto,y basado en un hecho real de tanta tracendencia para la historia de Mexico y realizada en el propio Mexico,le hayan dado un final tan malo,no tiene final. Que dececcion despues de dedicar tantas horas de mi tiempo,es el peor resumen de novela que he visto en mi vida",1193702400,5,354,4.546875
2334912,1,B0009XRZQ0,"Y que es lo que Televisa desea?... que uno forme su propia conclusion al final o que?? La produccion muy irresponsable porque esta obra queda totalmente inconclusa y parece no preocuparles a pesar de nustros comentarios.

Que lastima!

Aunque increible el reparto de actores y actuaciones, tanto en lo ficticio

como los acontecimientos historicos de nuestro Mexico y su independencia.",1180656000,3,385,5.383333333333334
2334913,2,B0009XRZQ0,"I saw this excellent novel in channel 41 (NY) many years ago,we were very interesting in saw it every night,but guess what? it finish without any warning, we were very disappointed because the tv channel never explain why they cut that novel in that way, last year i found this DVD set ""La Antorcha Encendida"" in Amazon and i order it very happy, because i assume we was going to see the end of this novel after many years, but the last DVD finish in the same manner than years ago, without any End!!!.

Maybe Televisa lost raiting when they do this master piece or were out of money, but the reality is they NEVER finish ""La Antorcha Encendida"" ,what a shame.that is my personal opinion.",1176768000,8,688,4.4603174603174605
2334914,1,B0009XRZQ0,Stay away until amazon eventually can get ahold of a new version. It actually lacks the ending!!!,1167350400,8,97,4.764705882352941
2334915,1,B0009XRZQ0,The novela's storyline was great. The only problem I had was with the ending. THERE WASN'T ANY. What a let down. I felt deceived.  To bad I can't get my money back.  Please don't buy this novela. It is a waste of time and money. I am left hanging because I don't know what happened at the end.,1164585600,10,293,4.0344827586206895
2334916,2,B0009XRZQ0,"Very disappointed in this production by televisa. I watched this for many hours only to find out that their is no ending. At first I thought maybe a disk was missing. This is ridiculous,how can somebody put something out that its incomplete. The acting and storyline was great that is the only reason why I give it 2 stars.",1163548800,9,323,4.491525423728813
2334917,1,B0009XRZQ0,"Warning!!!  This novella develops wonderful characters and a very interesting story the acting is great, the customs  and sound tract are all outstanding but then all of the sudden it ends without closing the story.  My wife and I were so disappointed - we thought we were missing the last disc or maybe there was a 2nd part.  It was a total disappointment.  Don't get suckered into watching this because it has a whole part of the story towards the end that seems to be missing - I can't believe they ended this novella like this - maybe the just left out the ending because they could not fit it all on the disc (?)",1161129600,12,617,4.3304347826086955
2334918,1,B0009XRZQ0,"What happened to the ending?. How can they possible do something so low as to release a product that takes 20 hrs to watch only to discover that it is imcomplete.
Five stars to the actors the director, set designers etc.
ZERO!!!!!!! to who ever decided to release it in this manner

I see comments from October 2010, I bought mine 2-3 years ago, can it be that Amazon is stil swindling people with this product!!!",1160870400,8,413,4.434210526315789
2334919,3,B0009XRZQ0,"I was disappointed to find that this telenovela is not closed captioned like the ad says. Unfortunatley, that was the main reason I ordered it, so that I could read it in Spanish.",1154736000,7,179,4.454545454545454

8069821,5,B0009XRZQ0,"Es cierto que es la version corta, pero para mi funciono bien puesto que soy ama de casa con escaso tiempo para ver television y me interesa mas la historia que la novela en si.
La Antorcha encendida es definitivamente la mejor novela historica que he visto, empezando con la musica, es excelente y de calidad, los actores ni se diga, mis respetos, excelentes todos, creo que ya no hay actores a la altura de los de hace un par de decadas, la escenografia, los lugares, todo es casi perfecto. Al ver esta novela el amor por Mexico y por toda la gente que sacrifico mucho para que fuera un pais libre crecio inmensamente. La recomiendo a todos los que esten interesados en conocer mas sobre la independencia de Mexico.
Es cierto tambien que le falta el final, me parece que es problema de algunos lotes, mi mama compro un set en Mexico y ella si tiene el final. Yo lo que hice es que lo vi en YouTube, solo busca ""La antorcha Encendida el final"" y ahi lo podras ver.",1373328000,,965,4.337016574585635

8069823,1,B0009XRZQ0,"I don't often do reviews, but this disk (set) was so bad, I had to.

Although the production has many merits, all is lost in the utterly incomprehensible editing. You will see from the other reviews that the series ends abruptly, without resolving the story or many (any) of its sub-plots. I can't stress this enough: in spite of high production values, very good acting, and brilliant intertwining of fictional characters and story lines with real history, this set will leave you profoundly disappointed.

Throughout the series there are many instances where the editors have jumped over non-essential story elements, and even complete story arcs, to condense a long telenovela into a manageable set of disks. Never-the-less, you can follow the main narrative and most of the minor arcs up to almost the end. The final episode, however, ends bewilderingly at the start of what must have been an important scene (one of the lead villains discovers his wife's corpse), and doesn't resolve any of the other, many, subplots, or even the principal story arc, the war for the independence of Mexico.

I simply can't imagine how or why such an utterly shoddy, sloppy, (fill in your own profanities here), could be released to the public as a viable product. I have seen a lot of bad editing in the conversion of long telenovelas to disk (not just Mexican, but Chinese, Indian, Turkish, and others), but absolutely nothing so bad as this. It is so bad, I am almost convinced that it must have been deliberate. Somebody must have really had it in for someone. But, like I said, in the end it is utterly incomprehensible.

One last word. I didn't bother reading any of the reviews which would have alerted me to this set's short comings because I assumed, based on other historical Mexican telenovelas that I have seen that this would be great. I won't make that mistake again.  I promise you, and more importantly myself, that I will pay more attention to others' reviews in the future.",1330387200,2,1979,4.8088235294117645
8069824,2,B0009XRZQ0,que triste que televisa tenga esta clase de novelas en las q hay tantos actores tan maravillosos y preparados pero q al final una novela de esta calidad quede inconclusa una verguenza de verdad ojala pudiera recuperar mi dinero no vale la pena ver algo asi si al final de invertir horas viendola y aprendiendo de nuestra historia no se concluye el tema no volvere a ordenar nada de novelas producidas por televisa porqueria.,1328140800,2,424,4.743243243243243

8069826,1,B0009XRZQ0,Televisa is at it again. This soap  opera was cut a bit too much. The story line has no continuity. Needles to say I'm very disappointed with this product.,1286064000,2,155,4.344827586206897
