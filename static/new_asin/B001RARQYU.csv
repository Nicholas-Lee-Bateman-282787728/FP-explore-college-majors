8337623,5,B001RARQYU,"A good video for anyone interested in firearms showmanship. Some of the best shooters who are no longer with us showing what can be done with rifle, shotgun & pistol.",1383004800,,166,4.566666666666666

8337625,5,B001RARQYU,"I had this on VHS and have ordered it on DVD. These shooters are great, particularly Herb Parsons. Now, actually almost all the feats have been duplicated, even those of the legendary Ed McGivern; but even so, the entertainment value and just plain awesomeness of these guys is great. Bill Jordan is such an original that even if someone could duplicate his feats, they could not duplicate Jordan. I love this video; there is something about seeing these now all passed guys show their stuff that you just do not get from those shows on Discovery. Definitely worth watching.",1303516800,,574,4.808080808080808
