While only two Madballs cartoons exist - the other being ""escape from orb"", this one has a completely different look to it. The animation style has the same cut-out style as the Monty Python cartoons by Terry Gilliam, the opening sequence to You Can't Do That On Television, and the old 80's bubble tape commercials.
