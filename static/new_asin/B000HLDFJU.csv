8140348,4,B000HLDFJU,"This was a random shelf selection at the Family video rental store.  Never heard of it, nor the preceding film, nor the animated series.  But after seeing this film, I will purchase them all for my family!

Kong: Return to the Jungle pours a lot of love and heart into an old, classic story, transforming it into a modern take with three-dimensional cartooning.  Watching it is very much like playing a video game, especially the characters.  And they are good characters: a guy who is Kong's ""brother,"" his big pilot friend, a beautiful cavegirl and her Sabretooth, and the big cat's adorable cub, for whom Kong has a soft spot.  Last but not least is the original Kong's love, now an elderly lady and geneticist.

But that's not all - the film also has some great songs about saving what we love and protecting freedom.

The only thing I was not able to suspend disbelief for was the so-called genetic ""cyber-link,"" which somehow puts a guy ""inside"" Kong's mind using DNA.  But that weak point is not enough to prevent enjoyment of the tremendous animation and direction.",1221436800,2,1073,4.695187165775401
