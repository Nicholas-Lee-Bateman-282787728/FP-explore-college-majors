3140246,1,B00153ZS30,"I had such high hopes for this collection. I grew up on most of these shows and thought it would be a sweet, nostalgic trip down memory lane. All of those hours spent in front of our big old, boxy television set while I waited to be old enough to go to school like my brothers and sisters!
Well, this was a revelation but not in the way that I expected. The production values on these shows was abysmally low. The writing was almost non-existent. The hosts and hostesses would never be allowed on tv today, they are utterly non-telegenic. The pace of these shows is glacially slow. If I see one more poorly designed hand puppet ....(they look like anyone with a few buttons, a styrofoam ball, and a sock could have made them). These are not entertaining anymore. They are boring, crude, and not even campy enough to be fun.",1211673600,9,823,4.421052631578948
3140247,5,B00153ZS30,"The Shout Factory, maker of this DVD set, has been the author of quite a few offbeat DVD and CD collections lately, often in partnership with PBS. This time Shout Factory has compiled a collection of typical Saturday morning shows from the 1950's. The set mimics what TV of that era did and starts out with the simplest shows for the smallest kids, then progresses to shows for older kids, assuming that the older kids get up later on Saturday. The following is the press release about the contents of the set:

DISC 1:

Episode from Kukla, Fran And Ollie 1948 - 1957
Kukla, Fran And Ollie debuted as a local Chicago show entitled Junior Jamboree and was renamed in 1948 when the installation of a coaxial cable linking the East Coast to the Midwest expanded its broadcast range. Established radio star Fran Allison played herself on the show as the perfect counterbalance to the antics of the puppets, and her uncanny ability to ad-lib allowed the show to run completely unscripted and unrehearsed.

Kukla, Fran And Ollie featured the creations of Burr Tillstrom, considered one of the greats in puppet history. He voiced and performed all of the puppet characters on the show and is credited with creating the puppeteering technique of watching the action on a small monitor while performing the characters, a practice still in use today.

Episode from Howdy Doody 1947 - 1960
Howdy Doody evolved from The Triple B Ranch, a radio program that featured the voice of ""Buffalo"" Bob Smith as himself and a character named Elmer who opened the show by saying ""Howdy Doody."" When Howdy Doody premiered on television it was an hour-long series that aired on Saturdays, but in 1948 it became the first network children's show to run five days a week, and eventually was broadcast in color in 1955. ""Buffalo"" Bob Smith created and hosted the show, as well as providing the voice of Howdy Doody.

For the show's final episode, Clarabelle the Clown--who never uttered a word throughout the program run--finally spoke the series' very last two words, saying, ""Goodbye, kids.""

Episode from Lassie 1954 - 1974
Originally created in 1938 by Eric Knight for a short story published in the Saturday Evening Post, Lassie became an immediate sensation that spawned a full-length novel, a feature film starring an 11-year-old named Elizabeth Taylor, a radio show and, in 1954, the Lassie television series.

The series--which ran for an amazing 20 years and won two of six Emmy Awards for which it was nominated--originally starred 13-year-old film veteran Tommy Rettig as Jeff Miller, Lassie's faithful owner and best friend for 110 episodes.

Episode from Annie Oakley 1954 - 1957
The real Annie Oakley, on whom this character was loosely based, was a sharpshooter with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in the late 1800s. As a television series, Annie Oakley hit the entertainment bull's-eye every week for three years in the mid-1950s.

Having appeared in dozens of both big- and small-screen Westerns, including 14 features with Gene Autry, Gail Davis was a natural to play the title role in the television series. In fact, Autry's own Flying `A' Productions coproduced Annie Oakley's syndicated 81-episode run.

Episode from Flash Gordon 1954
Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon comic strip, which debuted in 1934, has been translated into radio serials, animated television series, numerous feature films, comic books and novels over the past 50 years. This incarnation--filmed in Germany less than a decade after the end of World War II--was the first, and only, live-action television series up until 2007 and starred chiseled Steve Holland as Flash Gordon, operative of the Galaxy Bureau of Investigation.

DISC 2:

Episode from Ding Dong School 1952 - 1959
Dr. Frances R. Horwich, known simply to audiences as Miss Frances, took a leave of absence from her position as chairman of the education department at Chicago's Roosevelt College to host Ding Dong School, which became monumental in paving the way for preschool television.

Originally filmed in Chicago, and later in New York, Ding Dong School was so popular that after just six weeks it was picked up by NBC and was soon seen by millions of children throughout the United States.

Episode from Time For Beany 1949 - 1954
While viewers may be more familiar with Bob Clampett's Beany And Cecil in their cartoon incarnations, the public was first introduced to the silly, seasick serpent and his beanie-topped companion when they premiered as puppets, voiced by the talented Daws Butler and Stan Freberg. Though the series began as a local show in Los Angeles in 1949, by the following year Time For Beany had gone national and continued with much success through 1954.

One of the most famous fans of Time For Beany was none other than Albert Einstein.

Episode from The Paul Winchell Show 1956 - 1960
In 1956 self-taught ventriloquist Paul Winchell starred in Circus Time, only one of his many television series. After a year Circus Time was revamped and renamed The Paul Winchell Show, a moniker it retained until the show ended in 1960.

Giving voice to his own Jerry Mahoney puppet, Gargamel on The Smurfs and Tigger of Disney's Winnie The Pooh animated films, Paul Winchell brought heart to the characters he created. A true renaissance man, Winchell was also an inventor who held 30 patents, including one for an early model of an artificial heart he built in 1963. He also studied and practiced acupuncture and hypnosis and wrote widely on theology.

Episode from The Roy Rogers Show 1951 - 1957
The ""King of Cowboys,"" Roy Rogers was no stranger to America by the time he starred in The Roy Rogers Show, having already appeared in over a hundred movies by 1951.

In 1947 Rogers married Dale Evans, who became the ""Queen of the West."" Together they were one of America's most beloved couples. Along with many honors, they have the distinction of being the only married couple to serve as Grand Marshals of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade.

You can't think of The Roy Rogers Show, which ran from 1951 to 1957, without remembering ""his golden palomino"" Trigger and Bullet ""the wonder dog."" Visitors to the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Branson, Missouri, can actually see a taxidermist-prepared Trigger, stuffed and mounted, rearing up on his back legs, as one of the museum's most popular exhibits.

Episode from Captain Z-RO 1951 - 1956
Captain Z-RO came to us from a remote, uncharted region of a planet called Earth. When Captain Z-RO debuted in 1951, it was a 15-minute local show from San Francisco. In 1954, however, the show became syndicated and went national, switching to a 30-minute format and continuing with original episodes until 1956. It stayed on in reruns through 1960.

Captain Z-RO received much praise for its outstanding educational value, including honorable mention at the Twentieth American Exhibition of Educational Radio-Television Programs in 1956.

Roy Steffens, who also created and wrote the show, portrayed the title role of Captain Z-RO.

DISC 3:

Episode from The Rootie Kazootie Club 1950 - 1954
Created by Steve Carlin, who at the time was in charge of RCA's children's phonograph records, The Rootie Kazootie Club met over the airwaves from 1950 to 1954 with ""Big Todd"" Russell, Mr. Deetle Doodle and, of course, Rootie Kazootie!

""Big Todd"" Russell wasn't just comfortable with the juvenile members of The Rootie Kazootie Club. He also hosted quiz shows on radio such as Double Or Nothing and Strike It Rich and is perhaps best remembered as the creator and producer of The $64,000 Question.

Rootie Kazootie was extremely popular and led to a series of Rootie Kazootie Golden Books.

Episode from Winky Dink And You 1953 - 1957
Get out your Winky Dink kit, because it's time for Winky Dink And You--a show you didn't just watch . . . you actually got to play! Winky Dink And You was the first interactive television show, allowing children the opportunity to be a part of the show by placing a clear ""magic window"" on the television and drawing on it with crayons.

Jack Barry, who already had a successful run with Juvenile Jury, hosted the show. Barry later went on to emcee the 1970s game show Joker's Wild, but is perhaps most famous as the host and coproducer of the wildly popular Twenty-One, which created a great scandal by providing answers to contestants, nearly ruining Barry's career and prompting Congress to develop new laws that prohibited the fixing of quiz shows.

Winky Dink And You ran from 1953 to 1957, and if Winky Dink sounds a bit familiar, it's because the voice was provided by Mae Questel--best known as the voice of Olive Oyl and Betty Boop.

Episode from Super Circus 1949 - 1955
From 1949 to 1955, the small screen was transformed into the big top during Super Circus featuring Ringmaster (and former radio announcer) Claude Kirchner.

Ringmaster Kirchner, clowns Cliffy, Nicky and Scampy, and the various circus acts thrilled the kids. But it was bandleader Mary Hartline who became the real attraction.

Mary Hartline had a certain appeal, and suddenly fathers were happy to watch television alongside their kids. Hartline wasn't just popular with the dads, however. Kids adored her, which led to an abundance of merchandise such as Mary Hartline dolls, paper figures, apparel and books--even comic books titled Super Circus Featuring Mary Hartline.

Episode from Andy's Gang 1955 - 1960
""Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!"" Andy's Gang was an immensly popular variety show for kids starring Andy Devine (""Cookie"" in over 400 Roy Rogers Westerns, and ""Jingles"" in The Adventures Of Wild Bill Hickock). Along with Froggy the Gremlin, Midnight the Cat, Squeaky the Mouse and some other oddball regulars, there were skits, book-readings and weekly serials such as Little Fox (included in this episode) and Rhama Of The Jungle.

The show, the format, even Froggy the Gremlin all derived from Ed McConnell, who had been a children's radio host since the 1920s, and his 1943 program Smilin' Ed McConnell And The Buster Brown Shoe Gang. In 1950 Smilin' Ed brought the show to television under the title Smilin' Ed's Gang. When Ed died unexpectedly in 1955, Andy Devine took his place, and the show became Andy's Gang.

Episode from The Cisco Kid 1950 - 1956
""Here's adventure! Here's romance! Here's O. Henry's famous Robin Hood of the Old West--The Cisco Kid!"" While each episode of The Cisco Kid began with those words, very little about the television Cisco Kid harkened back to O. Henry's version.

In his 1907 book of short stories, The Heart Of The West, O. Henry introduced the Cisco Kid in ""The Caballero's Way."" The character was not Hispanic, he had no sidekick and, according to O. Henry, the Cisco Kid "" . . . killed for the love of it--because he was quick-tempered--to avoid arrest--for his own amusement--any reason that came to his mind would suffice.""

There were numerous films about the Cisco Kid as early as 1914 and even a radio series, but in the 1945 film The Cisco Kid Returns, Duncan Renaldo was introduced to audiences in the title role. He continued to make Cisco Kid films and was paired with Leo Carrillo as Pancho in his last five features.

In 1950 Renaldo and Carrillo reprised their roles for the Cisco Kid television series, ending each episode with the exclamations: ""Oh, Pancho!"" ""Oh, Cisco!""

Episode from Sky King 1951 - 1959
""Out of the clear blue of the Western sky comes Sky King,"" a '50s television series about an Arizona rancher and pilot who stumbles upon danger in every episode and then saves the day. Kirby Grant, who played as Schuyler ""Sky"" King, had appeared in dozens of films and was an accomplished aviator, which contributed to the believability of the show. The plane Sky flew was the Songbird and his ranch was called The Flying Crown.

Gloria Winters played Sky's niece, Penny. Winters was a well-rounded actress who appeared in many films and onstage. In 1964 her book Penny's Guide To Teen-age Charm And Popularity was published as an etiquette guide for teenage girls.

DISC 4:

2 Episodes from The Magic Clown 1949 - 1954
The Magic Clown was definitely sponsored by Bonamo's Turkish Taffy. The live and at-home audience sang the Bonamo's theme song, they said the magic word (""Bonamo""), and if they wanted the magic face kit, they could send in 20 cents . . . plus a wrapper from Bonamo's Turkish Taffy (which everyone in the studio seemed to be chewing). The Magic Clown might even make Turkish Taffy appear as part of his magic tricks.

The two ostensibly Turkish men making taffy on the wrapper of Bonamo's Turkish Taffy wore fezzes, so everyone on the program donned the headgear as well: from the Magic Clown--portrayed by several actors throughout the program's run--the audience, and even the puppet, Laffy (rhymes with ""taffy""). Ironically, in 1925, the fez was banned in Turkey and to this day is not usually worn.

In 1971 internationally renowned magician James Randi revived the series as The Magic Clown, but while the clowns may have changed, Bonamo's Turkish Taffy certainly did not.

Episode from Kids And Company 1951 - 1952
Originating in New York, this 1950s American Idol of the moppet world showcased kids with various abilities, but if you didn't have a great talent it was no matter. If you rescued a kid from quicksand or from the jaws of an alligator, there was a good chance you'd get your few minutes of fame on Kids And Company as well.

Kids And Company was hosted by Johnny Olson, who went on to become the announcer for successful game shows such as Match Game, To Tell The Truth and What's My Line? and, in 1972, went on to popularize one of the greatest catchphrases in game show history: The Price Is Right's ""Come on down!""

Episode from Juvenile Jury 1947 - 1954
Before Joker's Wild, and even before Winky Dink And You, Jack Barry hosted Juvenile Jury. Beginning on radio, the jury made their first televised deliberation in 1947 and continued offering their unpredictable verdicts until 1954.

A panel of five children between the ages of three and 12 appeared on the program every week to make pronouncements on dilemmas posed by viewers and audience members. Questions ranged from simple matters of opinion to advice on everyday problems of interest to children, with Barry skillfully managing to keep the participants at ease. Aside from the obvious entertainment value of the cast's candid responses, Juvenile Jury is also notable as the first commercially sponsored network television series (in this case, by General Foods).

Juvenile Jury was revived twice, in the 1970s (with Jack Barry returning) and again for a short time in 1983 with host Nipsey Russell.

Episode from The Pinky Lee Show 1954 - 1956
Pinky Lee was doing a show with Vivian Blaine called Those Two when producer Lawrence White found himself in need of a new host for a children's show after The Gabby Hayes Show was dropped. White's son begged him to hire Pinky Lee, and thus Lee was able to add ""children's show host"" to his rsum.

The fast pace of The Pinky Lee Show, which aired from 1954 to 1956, was quite ahead of its time, more comparable with the shows of today. A former burlesque performer, Pinky Lee brought a squeaky clean version of burlesque to his children's show.

Although the show ran until 1956, an illness caused Lee's absence from 1955 until the end of the show's run.

Episode from Sheena, Queen Of The Jungle 1955 - 1956
Sheena, Queen Of The Jungle first swung onto television screens in 1955, but Sheena's history jumps back to 1937 where the character was introduced in Wags, a British tabloid magazine. The following year Sheena appeared in Jumbo Comics, and that's when her popularity started to grow. She appeared in each issue and was even spun off into her own comic book, making her the first female to be a title character, three months ahead of DC's Wonder Woman.

Former model Irish McCalla played Sheena, despite never having done any acting before she was asked to audition for the part while pregnant with her second child.",1205971200,153,16053,4.8776634827332845

When we finally did get one, I'd get up before dawn on Saturdays, and sit in front of the box wrapped in a blanket, staring at the Indian on the test pattern until the programming began.

This is a fairly good selection of that programming. The quality is perfectly watchable, and my only regret if they they didn't produce a whole series of .these .",1385683200,4,447,4.022471910112359

3140290,5,B00153ZS30,"That might seem like a strange header for a review. How can you have a memory of anything you have never seen before?

For me, my interest in television has led me to read so much about the early days of American TV that even without viewing them-I live in the UK-I have become very familiar with it.

This handy compendium of childrens programmes from thw 1940s and 1950s is a beautiful and inexpensive way to go back to what was evidently a happier time on TV.Perhaps the children of today, used as they are to the frenetically paced programming which is often offered up to them, would find it a little difficult to adjust to the sedate pace of Ding Dong School, Winky Dink and You , etc but for me at least this is a highly entertainng package and one which I am very pleased I have purchased.",1254268800,,797,4.306666666666667
3140291,1,B00153ZS30,"I grew up when these shows were new and I remember them very well.  I have no idea who chose the episodes for the DVDs, but they did a terrible job, especially on Howdy Doody, Flash Gordon and Andy's Gang.  I remember Flash Gordon flying to a distant planet and confronting  the Emperor Ming.  The episode that was on the DVD wasn't anything like that.  The episodes chosen for the other  two shows were just as bad too, and I feel like I paid out all that money for nothing because I have no interest in watching any of the DVDs again.  The only ones I half way enjoyed were Annie Oakley and Roy Rogers.",1252195200,8,604,4.2
3140292,4,B00153ZS30,"I bought this for my parents (born in 1942 & '49) because there were many cartoons in this 4 disk set that they have talked about for years.  This was a fun surprise for them - not a birthday gift or anything because I was afraid of exactly what did happen.  The cartoons they remembered so fondly were really quite dumb.  Once they got over their surprise, they watched more and had a great time laughing at them.  Now they've let their friends borrow them and they are all laughing.  Soon we'll take it to my in-laws.

Overall, they are glad they had the chance to see these again, but they can't ever imagine pulling this DVD out again so they are happy to just pass it around to everyone.  It's a one-time watch so rent it or borrow it from the library if you can.  If we ever get it back, we'll donate ours to the local library.  For me, it was worth the $28 to see them laugh, but they said they'd never have paid that much for it.",1235433600,4,937,4.132596685082873
3140293,4,B00153ZS30,"This video brought back some old friends and memories.  I wish there were more eposodes of some of these shows available, I'd show them to my grandkids.  These programs were a lot better than the crap that's on Saturday morning TV today.  Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, Annie Oakly, Andy Devine, Sky King. I was not only entertained, but learned from these shows.",1235088000,2,356,4.709677419354839
3140294,1,B00153ZS30,"First of all,whomever put this compilation together, didn't know their weekENDS from their weekDAYS.  I guess we must have lived on different coasts or something, but I remember it very clearly. Yes Saturday mornings DID have,Howdy Doody, The Roy Rogers Show, Andy's Gang, Sky King, The Pinky Lee Show. But there were 6 other days to the week and Kukla, Fran and Ollie, Annie Oakley, Ding Dong School,(which was for pre-schoolers during the week), The Paul Winchell Show (known for his invention of the first man-made heart), Winky Dink And You, & The Cisco Kid, where all on during the weekDays.  The rest I did not mention because some were not intended for kids in the first place, and the rest don't even sound familiar to me... except for Flash Gordon, Time for Beany, Juvenile Jury, The Rootie Kazootie Club.  Just reading some of the negative reviews about this DVD set, and knowing what important shows where completely overlooked and replaced with whatever the people that put this together could find, makes me want to take it back to the store and get my money back. I haven't opened it yet, and I think I will. By the way. If anyone wants to know the NY line-up for the Real Saturday Mornings Show's, you can contact me at: [...]  Sheena Queen of The Jungle was not for kids.

However, I love the ""Golden Age of Television""...The Jack Benny Show, I Married Joan and others gave me high hopes for this collection. I'm afraid I was disappointed. To me at least, it was unwatchable. Unless sock puppets are your thing, it's going to be pretty boring. I guess we're just use to more bells and whistles in our entertainment these days. I seriously doubt you could get a child to sit still and watch it. I think in the 50's, people were still so excited by having shows come right into their very own homes, entertainment didn't have to be very good to make them happy....and that's what this DVD set is....not very good.",1225670400,3,700,4.434108527131783

3140297,2,B00153ZS30,"First of all, how about some truth in advertising?  Many of these shows are so obscure, and with good reason, that it is a ripoff putting them on here.  A couple of foreign-made sci-fi shows - ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Captain Z-RO"" are particularly bad.  Also, some shows from the early, early 50s, and even the 1940s, are jaw dropping in their awfulness - ""The Magic Clown"", ""Kids and Company"" and ""Super Circus"" fall into that category.

Next, some shows which might be remembered fondly by boomers are not well-represented here.  The episode of ""Howdy Doody"" is from its very first years, and does not include Chief Thunderthud, Princess Summerfall Winterspring, Dilly Dally, etc.  The ""PInky Lee Show"" is also from its very early days.

Particularly bad are the puppet shows - ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" is OK, but ""Rootie Kazootie"" and ""Beany and Cecil"" (another early incarnation, pre-Stan Freberg) are terrible.

Next category is shows that stunk then, and stink now - Ding Dong School, Winky Dink and You, Juvenile Jury.

Finally, I'd say that the exciting Westerns hold up pretty well - Roy Rogers, Annie Oakley, and Sky King are all winners.

Nostalgia value?  It is humorous to see how sponsors dominated the show's content, with the kids in the ""Peanut Gallery"" for ""The Magic Clown"" all chewing on ""Bonomo's Turkish Taffy"" and wearing fezes.

Overall, pretty bad.",1219190400,8,1368,4.925764192139738

Our family was regular consumers of many early TV shows -- so proud that we got a grainy, black-and-white picture on our Philco with the far-fringe antenna and rotor on the roof.  Early TV brought magic into our home.  Whether it was Howdy Doody, the great old westerns, the magic of(and later, the young woman featured in) Super Circus, we were transported far from our rural home in North Carolina into worlds we'd barely imagined.  Hiya Kids is a super flashback to those days -- the pictures are still grainy, the plots are still corny, but the magic on the Hiya Kids discs are well worth the few dollars and the time spent.

I was a child when these programs were originally on.  I watched them then and couldn't wait to see them on these DVDs.  TEDIOUS doesn't even begin to cover it.  The program of Miss Frances of Ding Dong School shows l-o-n-g minutes (!!!) of closeups of her blowing bubbles from a clay pipe.  That's it...minutes watching her slowly blow bubbles, and we're not talking big bubbles, fun bubbles or anything with some variety...just ordinary soap bubbles.  It seems like it goes on forever.

Kukla, Fran and Ollie begins with Kukla attempting to turn the pages of a Life Magazine without much success, mind you as he is a very primitive puppet without working fingers.  This goes on for long minutes while I waited for something else to happen...finally he gets into a long conversation with Ollie about if it's his magazine or Ollie's. It get's worse after that.  I didn't like Kukla, Fran and Ollie when I was a child, probably because the program (as I see it now) was full of adult themes and ideas. Discussing the merits of classifying people by their likes and dislikes: art, music, literature.  If someone was hi-brow or low-brow. Other puppets were questioned about their preferences, and one rather stupid looking one mentioned that he liked Alexander Calder's mobiles...which obviously was not meant for a 5 year old's understanding.

The point is, I'm not sure if that these programs have lost something in the 50-odd years since they've been on the air... or we, as a product of the move, move, move, fast, fast, fast era since Sesame Street started the ""commercial like"" TV programming we have become used to...are just too sophisticated to enjoy them anymore.",1213833600,31,1829,4.81150159744409

3140316,4,B00153ZS30,"I think it is commendable that Shout Factory puts out DVD box sets of obscure old shows that don't have a studio home. But if they're going to do ""rare,"" they should go all the way with it. Case in point: the Kukla, Fran and Ollie show included with this set has been around and available for many years from other companies. It isn't even the best of the black and white shows available. I can understand the company wanted to use the earliest KFO available (this one is from early 1949), but another, available episode from Feb. 1953 is much more entertaining and shows off the talents of Burr Tillstrom and Fran Allison much better than the one included in this set.
I also had a problem with the information that the box ""mimics what TV of that era did and starts out with the simplest shows for the smallest kids, then progresses to shows for older kids."" Kukla, Fran and Ollie was a ""prime time"" show for much of its run, appearing 5 days a week at 7 pm eastern. It's contemporary Howdy Doody ran in the afternoon. Yet Shout Factory includes it first on Disc 1 as a show for young children, followed by Howdy Doody. Kids enjoyed the puppetry of KFO, but it also included among its fans people like Tallulah Bankhead, Adlai Stevenson and Lillian Gish. None of whom could be called a child. One only has to look at the show itself to see that it has a much more sophisticated premise than other ""kid"" shows like Howdy or Rootie Kazootie. How many children (or adults, for that matter) in the 20th or 21st century could tell you what ""high brow"" or ""low brow"" meant (hint: it has nothing to do with hairstyle or plastic surgery!)? Yet the background of this episode of this ""kid show"" is Kukla and Fran trying to figure out the meaning of a Life magazine article on cultural classifications. Not really in the same league as Howdy Doody being forced to pay the bad guy 500 marbles a day, or else lose his show, is it?
Of course, people see ""puppets"" and think kids show. Tillstrom and Allison's unique talent always puzzled their networks and sponsors. Apparently this hasn't changed, as the programmer for this box set proved.
Finally, to the fellow who gave the set a ""1"" because he didn't like the puppets, I highly doubt you were around when these shows originated. True there are no special effects, no computerized animation, but the stories are cute. If you do some research on Jim Henson, you'll find out his early puppets looked like socks too.
I wish Shout Factory would put out a box set of Kukla, Fran and Ollie stuff only. There are some real gems among the 700 shows done in the '50s, if they just would take the time to check them out.",1212278400,39,2653,4.438524590163935

All of those hours spent in front of our big old, boxy television set while I waited to be old enough to go to school like my brothers and sisters!
Well, this was a revelation but not in the way that I expected. The production values on these shows was abysmally low. The writing was almost non-existent. The hosts and hostesses would never be allowed on tv today, they are utterly non-telegenic. The pace of these shows is glacially slow. If I see one more poorly designed hand puppet ....(they look like anyone with a few buttons, a styrofoam ball, and a sock could have made them). These are not entertaining anymore. They are boring, crude, and not even campy enough to be fun.",1211673600,9,823,4.421052631578948
3374744,5,B00153ZS30,"The Shout Factory, maker of this DVD set, has been the author of quite a few offbeat DVD and CD collections lately, often in partnership with PBS. This time Shout Factory has compiled a collection of typical Saturday morning shows from the 1950's. The set mimics what TV of that era did and starts out with the simplest shows for the smallest kids, then progresses to shows for older kids, assuming that the older kids get up later on Saturday. The following is the press release about the contents of the set:

DISC 1:

Episode from Kukla, Fran And Ollie 1948 - 1957
Kukla, Fran And Ollie debuted as a local Chicago show entitled Junior Jamboree and was renamed in 1948 when the installation of a coaxial cable linking the East Coast to the Midwest expanded its broadcast range. Established radio star Fran Allison played herself on the show as the perfect counterbalance to the antics of the puppets, and her uncanny ability to ad-lib allowed the show to run completely unscripted and unrehearsed.

Kukla, Fran And Ollie featured the creations of Burr Tillstrom, considered one of the greats in puppet history. He voiced and performed all of the puppet characters on the show and is credited with creating the puppeteering technique of watching the action on a small monitor while performing the characters, a practice still in use today.

Episode from Howdy Doody 1947 - 1960
Howdy Doody evolved from The Triple B Ranch, a radio program that featured the voice of ""Buffalo"" Bob Smith as himself and a character named Elmer who opened the show by saying ""Howdy Doody."" When Howdy Doody premiered on television it was an hour-long series that aired on Saturdays, but in 1948 it became the first network children's show to run five days a week, and eventually was broadcast in color in 1955. ""Buffalo"" Bob Smith created and hosted the show, as well as providing the voice of Howdy Doody.

For the show's final episode, Clarabelle the Clown--who never uttered a word throughout the program run--finally spoke the series' very last two words, saying, ""Goodbye, kids.""

Episode from Lassie 1954 - 1974
Originally created in 1938 by Eric Knight for a short story published in the Saturday Evening Post, Lassie became an immediate sensation that spawned a full-length novel, a feature film starring an 11-year-old named Elizabeth Taylor, a radio show and, in 1954, the Lassie television series.

The series--which ran for an amazing 20 years and won two of six Emmy Awards for which it was nominated--originally starred 13-year-old film veteran Tommy Rettig as Jeff Miller, Lassie's faithful owner and best friend for 110 episodes.

Episode from Annie Oakley 1954 - 1957
The real Annie Oakley, on whom this character was loosely based, was a sharpshooter with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in the late 1800s. As a television series, Annie Oakley hit the entertainment bull's-eye every week for three years in the mid-1950s.

Having appeared in dozens of both big- and small-screen Westerns, including 14 features with Gene Autry, Gail Davis was a natural to play the title role in the television series. In fact, Autry's own Flying `A' Productions coproduced Annie Oakley's syndicated 81-episode run.

Episode from Flash Gordon 1954
Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon comic strip, which debuted in 1934, has been translated into radio serials, animated television series, numerous feature films, comic books and novels over the past 50 years. This incarnation--filmed in Germany less than a decade after the end of World War II--was the first, and only, live-action television series up until 2007 and starred chiseled Steve Holland as Flash Gordon, operative of the Galaxy Bureau of Investigation.

DISC 2:

Episode from Ding Dong School 1952 - 1959
Dr. Frances R. Horwich, known simply to audiences as Miss Frances, took a leave of absence from her position as chairman of the education department at Chicago's Roosevelt College to host Ding Dong School, which became monumental in paving the way for preschool television.

Originally filmed in Chicago, and later in New York, Ding Dong School was so popular that after just six weeks it was picked up by NBC and was soon seen by millions of children throughout the United States.

Episode from Time For Beany 1949 - 1954
While viewers may be more familiar with Bob Clampett's Beany And Cecil in their cartoon incarnations, the public was first introduced to the silly, seasick serpent and his beanie-topped companion when they premiered as puppets, voiced by the talented Daws Butler and Stan Freberg. Though the series began as a local show in Los Angeles in 1949, by the following year Time For Beany had gone national and continued with much success through 1954.

One of the most famous fans of Time For Beany was none other than Albert Einstein.

Episode from The Paul Winchell Show 1956 - 1960
In 1956 self-taught ventriloquist Paul Winchell starred in Circus Time, only one of his many television series. After a year Circus Time was revamped and renamed The Paul Winchell Show, a moniker it retained until the show ended in 1960.

Giving voice to his own Jerry Mahoney puppet, Gargamel on The Smurfs and Tigger of Disney's Winnie The Pooh animated films, Paul Winchell brought heart to the characters he created. A true renaissance man, Winchell was also an inventor who held 30 patents, including one for an early model of an artificial heart he built in 1963. He also studied and practiced acupuncture and hypnosis and wrote widely on theology.

Episode from The Roy Rogers Show 1951 - 1957
The ""King of Cowboys,"" Roy Rogers was no stranger to America by the time he starred in The Roy Rogers Show, having already appeared in over a hundred movies by 1951.

In 1947 Rogers married Dale Evans, who became the ""Queen of the West."" Together they were one of America's most beloved couples. Along with many honors, they have the distinction of being the only married couple to serve as Grand Marshals of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade.

You can't think of The Roy Rogers Show, which ran from 1951 to 1957, without remembering ""his golden palomino"" Trigger and Bullet ""the wonder dog."" Visitors to the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in Branson, Missouri, can actually see a taxidermist-prepared Trigger, stuffed and mounted, rearing up on his back legs, as one of the museum's most popular exhibits.

Episode from Captain Z-RO 1951 - 1956
Captain Z-RO came to us from a remote, uncharted region of a planet called Earth. When Captain Z-RO debuted in 1951, it was a 15-minute local show from San Francisco. In 1954, however, the show became syndicated and went national, switching to a 30-minute format and continuing with original episodes until 1956. It stayed on in reruns through 1960.

Captain Z-RO received much praise for its outstanding educational value, including honorable mention at the Twentieth American Exhibition of Educational Radio-Television Programs in 1956.

Roy Steffens, who also created and wrote the show, portrayed the title role of Captain Z-RO.

DISC 3:

Episode from The Rootie Kazootie Club 1950 - 1954
Created by Steve Carlin, who at the time was in charge of RCA's children's phonograph records, The Rootie Kazootie Club met over the airwaves from 1950 to 1954 with ""Big Todd"" Russell, Mr. Deetle Doodle and, of course, Rootie Kazootie!

""Big Todd"" Russell wasn't just comfortable with the juvenile members of The Rootie Kazootie Club. He also hosted quiz shows on radio such as Double Or Nothing and Strike It Rich and is perhaps best remembered as the creator and producer of The $64,000 Question.

Rootie Kazootie was extremely popular and led to a series of Rootie Kazootie Golden Books.

Episode from Winky Dink And You 1953 - 1957
Get out your Winky Dink kit, because it's time for Winky Dink And You--a show you didn't just watch . . . you actually got to play! Winky Dink And You was the first interactive television show, allowing children the opportunity to be a part of the show by placing a clear ""magic window"" on the television and drawing on it with crayons.

Jack Barry, who already had a successful run with Juvenile Jury, hosted the show. Barry later went on to emcee the 1970s game show Joker's Wild, but is perhaps most famous as the host and coproducer of the wildly popular Twenty-One, which created a great scandal by providing answers to contestants, nearly ruining Barry's career and prompting Congress to develop new laws that prohibited the fixing of quiz shows.

Winky Dink And You ran from 1953 to 1957, and if Winky Dink sounds a bit familiar, it's because the voice was provided by Mae Questel--best known as the voice of Olive Oyl and Betty Boop.

Episode from Super Circus 1949 - 1955
From 1949 to 1955, the small screen was transformed into the big top during Super Circus featuring Ringmaster (and former radio announcer) Claude Kirchner.

Ringmaster Kirchner, clowns Cliffy, Nicky and Scampy, and the various circus acts thrilled the kids. But it was bandleader Mary Hartline who became the real attraction.

Mary Hartline had a certain appeal, and suddenly fathers were happy to watch television alongside their kids. Hartline wasn't just popular with the dads, however. Kids adored her, which led to an abundance of merchandise such as Mary Hartline dolls, paper figures, apparel and books--even comic books titled Super Circus Featuring Mary Hartline.

Episode from Andy's Gang 1955 - 1960
""Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!"" Andy's Gang was an immensly popular variety show for kids starring Andy Devine (""Cookie"" in over 400 Roy Rogers Westerns, and ""Jingles"" in The Adventures Of Wild Bill Hickock). Along with Froggy the Gremlin, Midnight the Cat, Squeaky the Mouse and some other oddball regulars, there were skits, book-readings and weekly serials such as Little Fox (included in this episode) and Rhama Of The Jungle.

The show, the format, even Froggy the Gremlin all derived from Ed McConnell, who had been a children's radio host since the 1920s, and his 1943 program Smilin' Ed McConnell And The Buster Brown Shoe Gang. In 1950 Smilin' Ed brought the show to television under the title Smilin' Ed's Gang. When Ed died unexpectedly in 1955, Andy Devine took his place, and the show became Andy's Gang.

Episode from The Cisco Kid 1950 - 1956
""Here's adventure! Here's romance! Here's O. Henry's famous Robin Hood of the Old West--The Cisco Kid!"" While each episode of The Cisco Kid began with those words, very little about the television Cisco Kid harkened back to O. Henry's version.

In his 1907 book of short stories, The Heart Of The West, O. Henry introduced the Cisco Kid in ""The Caballero's Way."" The character was not Hispanic, he had no sidekick and, according to O. Henry, the Cisco Kid "" . . . killed for the love of it--because he was quick-tempered--to avoid arrest--for his own amusement--any reason that came to his mind would suffice.""

There were numerous films about the Cisco Kid as early as 1914 and even a radio series, but in the 1945 film The Cisco Kid Returns, Duncan Renaldo was introduced to audiences in the title role. He continued to make Cisco Kid films and was paired with Leo Carrillo as Pancho in his last five features.

In 1950 Renaldo and Carrillo reprised their roles for the Cisco Kid television series, ending each episode with the exclamations: ""Oh, Pancho!"" ""Oh, Cisco!""

Episode from Sky King 1951 - 1959
""Out of the clear blue of the Western sky comes Sky King,"" a '50s television series about an Arizona rancher and pilot who stumbles upon danger in every episode and then saves the day. Kirby Grant, who played as Schuyler ""Sky"" King, had appeared in dozens of films and was an accomplished aviator, which contributed to the believability of the show. The plane Sky flew was the Songbird and his ranch was called The Flying Crown.

Gloria Winters played Sky's niece, Penny. Winters was a well-rounded actress who appeared in many films and onstage. In 1964 her book Penny's Guide To Teen-age Charm And Popularity was published as an etiquette guide for teenage girls.

DISC 4:

2 Episodes from The Magic Clown 1949 - 1954
The Magic Clown was definitely sponsored by Bonamo's Turkish Taffy. The live and at-home audience sang the Bonamo's theme song, they said the magic word (""Bonamo""), and if they wanted the magic face kit, they could send in 20 cents . . . plus a wrapper from Bonamo's Turkish Taffy (which everyone in the studio seemed to be chewing). The Magic Clown might even make Turkish Taffy appear as part of his magic tricks.

The two ostensibly Turkish men making taffy on the wrapper of Bonamo's Turkish Taffy wore fezzes, so everyone on the program donned the headgear as well: from the Magic Clown--portrayed by several actors throughout the program's run--the audience, and even the puppet, Laffy (rhymes with ""taffy""). Ironically, in 1925, the fez was banned in Turkey and to this day is not usually worn.

In 1971 internationally renowned magician James Randi revived the series as The Magic Clown, but while the clowns may have changed, Bonamo's Turkish Taffy certainly did not.

Episode from Kids And Company 1951 - 1952
Originating in New York, this 1950s American Idol of the moppet world showcased kids with various abilities, but if you didn't have a great talent it was no matter. If you rescued a kid from quicksand or from the jaws of an alligator, there was a good chance you'd get your few minutes of fame on Kids And Company as well.

Kids And Company was hosted by Johnny Olson, who went on to become the announcer for successful game shows such as Match Game, To Tell The Truth and What's My Line? and, in 1972, went on to popularize one of the greatest catchphrases in game show history: The Price Is Right's ""Come on down!""

Episode from Juvenile Jury 1947 - 1954
Before Joker's Wild, and even before Winky Dink And You, Jack Barry hosted Juvenile Jury. Beginning on radio, the jury made their first televised deliberation in 1947 and continued offering their unpredictable verdicts until 1954.

A panel of five children between the ages of three and 12 appeared on the program every week to make pronouncements on dilemmas posed by viewers and audience members. Questions ranged from simple matters of opinion to advice on everyday problems of interest to children, with Barry skillfully managing to keep the participants at ease. Aside from the obvious entertainment value of the cast's candid responses, Juvenile Jury is also notable as the first commercially sponsored network television series (in this case, by General Foods).

Juvenile Jury was revived twice, in the 1970s (with Jack Barry returning) and again for a short time in 1983 with host Nipsey Russell.

Episode from The Pinky Lee Show 1954 - 1956
Pinky Lee was doing a show with Vivian Blaine called Those Two when producer Lawrence White found himself in need of a new host for a children's show after The Gabby Hayes Show was dropped. White's son begged him to hire Pinky Lee, and thus Lee was able to add ""children's show host"" to his rsum.

The fast pace of The Pinky Lee Show, which aired from 1954 to 1956, was quite ahead of its time, more comparable with the shows of today. A former burlesque performer, Pinky Lee brought a squeaky clean version of burlesque to his children's show.

Although the show ran until 1956, an illness caused Lee's absence from 1955 until the end of the show's run.

Episode from Sheena, Queen Of The Jungle 1955 - 1956
Sheena, Queen Of The Jungle first swung onto television screens in 1955, but Sheena's history jumps back to 1937 where the character was introduced in Wags, a British tabloid magazine. The following year Sheena appeared in Jumbo Comics, and that's when her popularity started to grow. She appeared in each issue and was even spun off into her own comic book, making her the first female to be a title character, three months ahead of DC's Wonder Woman.

Former model Irish McCalla played Sheena, despite never having done any acting before she was asked to audition for the part while pregnant with her second child.",1205971200,153,16053,4.8776634827332845

3374787,5,B00153ZS30,"That might seem like a strange header for a review. How can you have a memory of anything you have never seen before?

For me, my interest in television has led me to read so much about the early days of American TV that even without viewing them-I live in the UK-I have become very familiar with it.

This handy compendium of childrens programmes from thw 1940s and 1950s is a beautiful and inexpensive way to go back to what was evidently a happier time on TV.Perhaps the children of today, used as they are to the frenetically paced programming which is often offered up to them, would find it a little difficult to adjust to the sedate pace of Ding Dong School, Winky Dink and You , etc but for me at least this is a highly entertainng package and one which I am very pleased I have purchased.",1254268800,,797,4.306666666666667

The episodes chosen for the other  two shows were just as bad too, and I feel like I paid out all that money for nothing because I have no interest in watching any of the DVDs again.

Once they got over their surprise, they watched more and had a great time laughing at them.  Now they've let their friends borrow them and they are all laughing.  Soon we'll take it to my in-laws.

Overall, they are glad they had the chance to see these again, but they can't ever imagine pulling this DVD out again so they are happy to just pass it around to everyone.  It's a one-time watch so rent it or borrow it from the library if you can.  If we ever get it back, we'll donate ours to the local library.  For me, it was worth the $28 to see them laugh, but they said they'd never have paid that much for it.",1235433600,4,937,4.132596685082873

These programs were a lot better than the crap that's on Saturday morning TV today.  Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, Annie Oakly, Andy Devine, Sky King.

3374791,1,B00153ZS30,"First of all,whomever put this compilation together, didn't know their weekENDS from their weekDAYS.  I guess we must have lived on different coasts or something, but I remember it very clearly. Yes Saturday mornings DID have,Howdy Doody, The Roy Rogers Show, Andy's Gang, Sky King, The Pinky Lee Show. But there were 6 other days to the week and Kukla, Fran and Ollie, Annie Oakley, Ding Dong School,(which was for pre-schoolers during the week), The Paul Winchell Show (known for his invention of the first man-made heart), Winky Dink And You, & The Cisco Kid, where all on during the weekDays.  The rest I did not mention because some were not intended for kids in the first place, and the rest don't even sound familiar to me... except for Flash Gordon, Time for Beany, Juvenile Jury, The Rootie Kazootie Club.  Just reading some of the negative reviews about this DVD set, and knowing what important shows where completely overlooked and replaced with whatever the people that put this together could find, makes me want to take it back to the store and get my money back. I haven't opened it yet, and I think I will. By the way. If anyone wants to know the NY line-up for the Real Saturday Mornings Show's, you can contact me at: [...]  Sheena Queen of The Jungle was not for kids.

3374792,3,B00153ZS30,"First of all, let me just say I wasn't even born in the 50's. However, I love the ""Golden Age of Television""...The Jack Benny Show, I Married Joan and others gave me high hopes for this collection. I'm afraid I was disappointed. To me at least, it was unwatchable. Unless sock puppets are your thing, it's going to be pretty boring. I guess we're just use to more bells and whistles in our entertainment these days. I seriously doubt you could get a child to sit still and watch it. I think in the 50's, people were still so excited by having shows come right into their very own homes, entertainment didn't have to be very good to make them happy....and that's what this DVD set is....not very good.",1225670400,3,700,4.434108527131783

3374794,2,B00153ZS30,"First of all, how about some truth in advertising?  Many of these shows are so obscure, and with good reason, that it is a ripoff putting them on here.  A couple of foreign-made sci-fi shows - ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Captain Z-RO"" are particularly bad.  Also, some shows from the early, early 50s, and even the 1940s, are jaw dropping in their awfulness - ""The Magic Clown"", ""Kids and Company"" and ""Super Circus"" fall into that category.

Next, some shows which might be remembered fondly by boomers are not well-represented here.  The episode of ""Howdy Doody"" is from its very first years, and does not include Chief Thunderthud, Princess Summerfall Winterspring, Dilly Dally, etc.  The ""PInky Lee Show"" is also from its very early days.

Particularly bad are the puppet shows - ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" is OK, but ""Rootie Kazootie"" and ""Beany and Cecil"" (another early incarnation, pre-Stan Freberg) are terrible.

Next category is shows that stunk then, and stink now - Ding Dong School, Winky Dink and You, Juvenile Jury.

Finally, I'd say that the exciting Westerns hold up pretty well - Roy Rogers, Annie Oakley, and Sky King are all winners.

Nostalgia value?  It is humorous to see how sponsors dominated the show's content, with the kids in the ""Peanut Gallery"" for ""The Magic Clown"" all chewing on ""Bonomo's Turkish Taffy"" and wearing fezes.

Overall, pretty bad.",1219190400,8,1368,4.925764192139738

Our family was regular consumers of many early TV shows -- so proud that we got a grainy, black-and-white picture on our Philco with the far-fringe antenna and rotor on the roof.  Early TV brought magic into our home.  Whether it was Howdy Doody, the great old westerns, the magic of(and later, the young woman featured in) Super Circus, we were transported far from our rural home in North Carolina into worlds we'd barely imagined.  Hiya Kids is a super flashback to those days -- the pictures are still grainy, the plots are still corny, but the magic on the Hiya Kids discs are well worth the few dollars and the time spent.  Score one for the Peanut Gallery!!",1217116800,2,723,4.565891472868217

3374808,2,B00153ZS30,"We live in an age where everything is new, new, new, fast, fast, fast...faster, and we forget what it was really like when we were (well me, anyway) younger.  I was a child when these programs were originally on.  I watched them then and couldn't wait to see them on these DVDs.  TEDIOUS doesn't even begin to cover it.  The program of Miss Frances of Ding Dong School shows l-o-n-g minutes (!!!) of closeups of her blowing bubbles from a clay pipe.  That's it...minutes watching her slowly blow bubbles, and we're not talking big bubbles, fun bubbles or anything with some variety...just ordinary soap bubbles.  It seems like it goes on forever.

Kukla, Fran and Ollie begins with Kukla attempting to turn the pages of a Life Magazine without much success, mind you as he is a very primitive puppet without working fingers.  This goes on for long minutes while I waited for something else to happen...finally he gets into a long conversation with Ollie about if it's his magazine or Ollie's. It get's worse after that.  I didn't like Kukla, Fran and Ollie when I was a child, probably because the program (as I see it now) was full of adult themes and ideas. Discussing the merits of classifying people by their likes and dislikes: art, music, literature.  If someone was hi-brow or low-brow. Other puppets were questioned about their preferences, and one rather stupid looking one mentioned that he liked Alexander Calder's mobiles...which obviously was not meant for a 5 year old's understanding.

The point is, I'm not sure if that these programs have lost something in the 50-odd years since they've been on the air... or we, as a product of the move, move, move, fast, fast, fast era since Sesame Street started the ""commercial like"" TV programming we have become used to...are just too sophisticated to enjoy them anymore.",1213833600,31,1829,4.81150159744409

So is it worth it, GAWD YES!!!!!!It is great old tv which is good stuff to watch

3374813,4,B00153ZS30,"I think it is commendable that Shout Factory puts out DVD box sets of obscure old shows that don't have a studio home. But if they're going to do ""rare,"" they should go all the way with it. Case in point: the Kukla, Fran and Ollie show included with this set has been around and available for many years from other companies. It isn't even the best of the black and white shows available. I can understand the company wanted to use the earliest KFO available (this one is from early 1949), but another, available episode from Feb. 1953 is much more entertaining and shows off the talents of Burr Tillstrom and Fran Allison much better than the one included in this set.
I also had a problem with the information that the box ""mimics what TV of that era did and starts out with the simplest shows for the smallest kids, then progresses to shows for older kids."" Kukla, Fran and Ollie was a ""prime time"" show for much of its run, appearing 5 days a week at 7 pm eastern. It's contemporary Howdy Doody ran in the afternoon. Yet Shout Factory includes it first on Disc 1 as a show for young children, followed by Howdy Doody. Kids enjoyed the puppetry of KFO, but it also included among its fans people like Tallulah Bankhead, Adlai Stevenson and Lillian Gish. None of whom could be called a child. One only has to look at the show itself to see that it has a much more sophisticated premise than other ""kid"" shows like Howdy or Rootie Kazootie. How many children (or adults, for that matter) in the 20th or 21st century could tell you what ""high brow"" or ""low brow"" meant (hint: it has nothing to do with hairstyle or plastic surgery!)? Yet the background of this episode of this ""kid show"" is Kukla and Fran trying to figure out the meaning of a Life magazine article on cultural classifications. Not really in the same league as Howdy Doody being forced to pay the bad guy 500 marbles a day, or else lose his show, is it?
Of course, people see ""puppets"" and think kids show. Tillstrom and Allison's unique talent always puzzled their networks and sponsors. Apparently this hasn't changed, as the programmer for this box set proved.
Finally, to the fellow who gave the set a ""1"" because he didn't like the puppets, I highly doubt you were around when these shows originated. True there are no special effects, no computerized animation, but the stories are cute. If you do some research on Jim Henson, you'll find out his early puppets looked like socks too.
I wish Shout Factory would put out a box set of Kukla, Fran and Ollie stuff only. There are some real gems among the 700 shows done in the '50s, if they just would take the time to check them out.",1212278400,39,2653,4.438524590163935
