8054084,5,B0007YJGMM,"This DVD, like the related basic techniques DVD and the ""Street Boxing"" DVD, presents modern Savate de Rue self-defense. The presentation is concise and precise. The mastery and passion of these Artists is clearly seen. I appreciate the combined phases of savate, boxing and grappling of this method. Original savate and boxing included substantial effective grappling -- like takedowns such as scissors, veronicas, cross-buttocks, grapevine trips, gooseneck trips, flying-mules and Irish-whips -- and other combat wrestling. Modernized techniques, much like those and jiujitsu, are smoothly integrated with very effective streamlined kickboxing and related combat training to deal with realistic street self-defense situations -- in this DVD as well as the other two. Some eclectic martial artists will be inspired by various good sources of martial arts -- such as this fine DVD and related ones.",1237334400,3,898,5.659259259259259
8054085,4,B0007YJGMM,"I received both  Savate Defense Basic and Advanced Techniques from Amazon.com and they did not play in my DVD player? Problem was these DVD's will only play in a DVD player made for Europe (PAL) not in a DVD player made for USA and Canada (NHTSA). Contacting Amazon.com was not much help as they could not tell me if they have DVD's for USA? Just to send back my DVD's and they would send me new ones?

I opted to buy a new DVD player that would play these DVD's as well as my other USA DVD's. I bought a $60.00 Toshiba SD-780KR DVD player from bhphotovideo.com. Both DVD's play great now!

Savate Defense Advanced teaches a very easy to learn (yet highly effective) way to defend against a knife attack. The instruction continues into empty hand against a stick attack. Has several Judo type throws against a person attacking with a punch. It teaches ground grappling locks and classic Judo type chokes. There is a section on pad training where you practice kicking, punching or knee strikes to the pads and lastly it follows up with a section on defending by kicking to you opponents legs when you find yourself on the ground. All in all I highly recommend this tape as well as the previous one!",1211068800,3,1197,4.481651376146789
