thanks",1396137600,,111,4.6
4401474,5,B0014EW8T2,"Sorry to say...I randomly found this same dvd at Dollar Tree! I brought it home and my 2 teen boys laughed at me. (they guffawed at my dated purchase from the 80's) But needless to say, I popped it in the dvd player and watched all 234 minutes of great entertainment, while doing my ironing. I remember back when, my younger brothers watched this series on tv. The dvd format quality is awesome and I was reminded of how at every ending of each episode, there would always be a good positive message. Memories revisited...kids today should get away from all the crazy anime and watch the old-school stuff sometimes!",1388966400,,615,4.6
4401475,5,B0014EW8T2,"I actually thought I was buying the eighties version of He-man, and was disappointed when it was a new version from 2000 or so. I popped it in the dvd player for my son, and soon his Dad was watching with him! They loved the battle scenes in this cartoon. I liked how they kept the very same story line, but made it a little more detailed.  I think it was an excellent choice.  Love it!",1360972800,,386,4.065789473684211
4401476,5,B0014EW8T2,"I used to love this show as a kid growing up,i remember having all the action figures except Evil Lynn and Man at Arms, brings back alot of great memories,i seen this at Target for 5 dollars and had to get it,the color and picture are fantastic,i can't see any specs of dirt that are really noticable,very well done for an early to mid 80s cartoon,the animation is really good,better than i remember,its nice to see cartoons that aren't digitally done like they are these days,the characters we're drawn so good, one of the great cartoons of all time.",1318291200,2,551,4.575757575757576

Mekanek's Lament
Night of the Shadow Beasts
Underworld
The Mystery of Anwat Gar
The Monsters Within
The Roboto Gambit
Trust
Orko's Garden
Buzz-Off's Pride",1284163200,4,529,7.516129032258065
4401478,2,B0014EW8T2,"Sure, you can pay ten dollars and get this set of He-Man episodes...OR you can buy the entire series, which includes all of the episodes included here, for virtually the same price, but with tons more stuff.  This set is nothing more than a cheap cash grab.  It's one of the very best cartoon series ever made, and the episode arc with the Snake Men is utterly jaw-dropping (figuratively and literally!).  BUT...you won't get that stuff on this ""cash grab"" set...so buy the whole series, which is available right here on Amazon for the same price.  Have I beat that point into the ground yet?  Well, it's only because I don't want you getting ripped off.",1283904000,2,654,4.603448275862069
