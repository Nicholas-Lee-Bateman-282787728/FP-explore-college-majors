2614043,2,B000GIWLNA,"I was moved by the scenes from Pyaasa that can be viewed on the web.  Based on that, and other reviews, I bought this DVD in hopes that it would be much better quality than the low resolution video captures on  the web.  No such luck.  If you want to see the quality of this transfer from film to DVD, the web pieces are as good as it gets.  The film is cluttered with debris and old fashioned splices in the middle of a scene.  The video contrast is awful.  The images are too often greyed out, with no contrast, or experiments in abstract black and white.  The sound is low-fi midrange; no bass, no treble.  With such an excellent film industry, India should have something like the Library of Congress restoration project as in the U.S.  Pyaasa is moving, the music wonderful, the acting heart-wrenching, but this transfer is tragically inferior.",1246665600,5,849,4.526315789473684
2614044,5,B000GIWLNA,"Spoiler Alert;
I had known about this movie for a while as it was on Time magazine's ""100 greatest movies"" list, now I know why.  Yes, as one reviewer mentioned the subtitles could have been much better, but this is not the fault of the people who made the movie.  There is a translation for the song ""Jaane kya tune"" on You tube if your interested [I am going to get an Indian friend to translate all the other lyrics].

This movie is one of the most powerful movies ever made.  Guru Dutt and all the other actors are so natural in their roles, there is no overacting like you see from alot of the present day Bollywood ""actors"" [Aamir Khan you are excluded].  What can I say about the beautiful, haunting music by S D Burman and the deep, moving lyrics of Sahir Ludhianvi brought to life by M. Rafi and Geeta Dutt?
""Yeh Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaaye, To Kya Hai?"" This means loosely ""so what if I gain this world?"" the poet goes on to mention all the evil and falsehood in this world and asks ""why would I want the glory of this material world?""
What decent person in today's world has not asked this question at some point?  I was so moved by Dutt's performance in the scene where he walks in on his ""memorial service"". The reaction on the faces of the different people in his life was so priceless e.g Waheeda Rehman's character who having thought till that moment that she had lost the one man she ever loved becomes radiant with joy.
The movie captures the struggles of the pure and good hearted in an often heartless world.  In the end though as the movie shows, the struggle is worth it, no earthly riches can buy you peace of mind and unconditional love.",1207958400,9,1659,4.315112540192926
2614045,2,B000GIWLNA,"I agree with the previous review, this is a gem in classic Indian cinema. Unfortunately this review is of the product and not the movie. I have three issues.

First is the transfer quality of sound and image, which are sub-par. Way sub-par.

Second is the translation, and this is the real sticking point. The translation is horrid. I mean, bad grammar, lines left untranslated, and '&quote;' instead of """". Example the word love is supposed to be in quotes, and it shows up &quote;love&quote;. This happens multiple times, obviously no one bothered to WATCH THE FRIGGIN' FILM before releasing it.

Finally, and still related to translation, is the fact that none of the songs are translated. This is especially problematic since the story is about a poet, and all of his poems are recited as songs. What I figure must be some of the most important parts of the film are completely unavailable to me. They are crucial to the story, I gather, but without translation it's impossible to tell.

This film is great, and is worthy of viewing, if you can get your hands on a good version, but this ain't it. I'd reccomend waiting for a better version so as to watch it properly. Hopefully we'll get such a version soon.",1207872000,18,1213,4.654205607476635
2614046,5,B000GIWLNA,"This is one of the most poetic, sad, beautiful, melancholy films I have ever seen.  It is one of my favorite Bollywood/Indian films, and it's still considered a classic today.  I would even place it in a top 100 list if I had to compile one.  Guru Dutt is probably the most underrated filmmaker/star in India, as he died young (at 40 or so), and his films were very different than the usual happy, happy, joy, joy Bollywood cinema that most of us are used to.  This film, along with Paper Flowers (aka Kagaaz de Phool) are considered his best films, and they deserve every bit of praise that comes their way.  Guru plays a struggling poet here.  Because of a misunderstandgin he is mistaken for dead, and his fame skyrockets after people think he's dead.  It's a very accurate depiction of humanity.  The most moving scene here is actually one of the songs (the songs in Guru Dutt's films move the films along beautifully, and they are never intrusive, like they are on a lot of Bollywood films) with its unbelievably haunting chorus of ""where are those who claim to be proud of this land?"" as Guru's character is wandering through an avenue of vice.  This film is a poetic masterpiece, and deserves to be better known...",1190246400,8,1221,4.564220183486238

8132799,1,B000GIWLNA,"It is shocking how one of the greatest films to have ever come out of India is treated in the country of origin! What is ironic is that the film does have a better version available - all the way from France. Yes, this is absolutely true. French studio Carlotta Films released what has become the definitive home version is still available albeit at inflated prices because it is simply the best way to watch this masterpiece at this time. The French DVD release comes as a twin DVD pack consisting of the film ""Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam"" along with it. The DVD has the documentary ""In Search of Guru Dutt"" as an extra feature. The French version surprisingly from a clear and pristine print, and the audio in a Dolby Digital Mono mix. This means that the French version, at present, the only way to see the film as it was intended, at least nearly so. The presentation is accurate and the picture quality is the best yet.

The French version is so easy on the eye that the Ultra, Eros and Yash Raj versions would remind you of hell. The desi DVDs proudly claim to have digitally enhanced the audio to 5.1. The sound is NOT 5.1 Surround but a poor mono presentation. In short, AVOID the desi editions and do yourself a favour and find the French release from Carlotta Films and buy that one instead. You will pay more but then you will get more. 'Pyaasa' is a film that deserves the highest praise and the best presentation on dvd or blu-ray. It is shameful that the French treat our films better than we do.",1439856000,2,1504,4.39068100358423
8132800,5,B000GIWLNA,"A haunting philosophical existential treatise on life as we know it. One of the greatest Hindi films of all time. Yes it is old (1957) and the transfer poor at times. Richly translated, much more than some more modern films. Contrary to other reviews all of the haunting songs are translated. This is a masterpiece. Certainly not one of your typical Bollywood musicals.",1439078400,,369,4.873015873015873

8132805,5,B000GIWLNA,"Guru Dutt--an Indian actor, director, and producer from the golden age of Hindi cinema in the 1950s--was a matinee idol who became one of the greatest filmmakers in history. A luminary artist in the commercial industry of Bollywood, he's often called ""the Orson Welles of India."" He's revered in his home country and has a huge cult following among film buffs around the world. His masterpiece 'Pyaasa,' which he directed and starred in, was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 best films of all time.

The title means ""thirst,"" and it's one of many allusions in the film to the crucifixion of Christ--the story's overarching metaphor--a dramatically grandiose one and certainly unusual in a Hindi film. Dutt's character, Vijay, a starving poet, is the persecuted martyr and art is his religion. He's tormented by his detractors--the lover who dumped him, the publisher who rejects him, his brothers who resent him, the husband who's jealous of him--but he's the source of his greatest anguish as he capitulates to an existential crisis so profound there's no recovering from it. The character is enigmatically complex--a sensitive genius whose suffering is noble, but also a self-pitying, misogynistic narcissist.

The two women who love him--Meena (Mala Sinha) and Gulabo (Waheeda Rehman)--agonize over him. Through them, Dutt the filmmaker reveals his feminist understanding of the psychic pain caused by male sexism, even as his character is the one inflicting it. Meena is Vijay's first love. She's enthralled with him for the man he is, but he adores her only as an abstraction of love. In one telling musical number, he daydreams about her instead of paying attention to her while she's sitting right next to him. Understandably hurt and sick of being ignored, she leaves him, and perhaps believing no man is capable of meeting her emotional needs, she settles for marrying a wealthy man. Vijay later lashes out at her for ""selling love for comfort."" He stops short of calling her a whore, but her husband says it for him when he discovers her alone with him. In the very next scene, Vijay saves the actual prostitute in his life, Gulabo, from being arrested by tenderly embracing her and telling the cop she's his wife. Gulabo understands and appreciates his talent, and unlike Meena, she asks nothing of him (because she doesn't have a shred of self-respect). That makes her, in his eyes, virtuous. All three yearn for their humanity to be recognized, but Vijay is the only one incapable of reciprocating.

Dutt was a troubled artist himself, but he made this tribute to the tortured poet in his soul after a successful commercial career, and 'Pyaasa' likewise was a box-office hit. For Dutt, ignominious failure came later, with his next film, the ominously autobiographical 'Kaagaz Ke Phool' (1959)--a flop and a creative achievement second only to 'Pyaasa.'

8132806,5,B000GIWLNA,"Chosen by the India Times as one of its ""Must See Bollywood Films"", ""Pyaasa"" (""Thirst"") is truly a timeless classic irregardless of language, culture or national orgin.

Directed, produced and starring the legendary Guru Dutt in the lead role, ""Pyaasa"" is the tale of Vijay, a failed poet (his manuscripts are literally sold for wastepaper!) who wanders the streets alone and hungry, ultimately befriending a golden-hearted prostitute named Gulabo (portrayed by the also legendary Waheeda Rehman), who sees his true talent and falls in love with him.

Through a series of events, though, Vijay is mistakenly presumed dead, and his posthumously published volume of poems becomes a bestseller.  He attempts to correct this error and his publisher, realizing the potential loss in sales and profit, forcibly confines Vijay to a mental asylum, keeping his existence a secret.  Vijay eventually escapes, only to publicly reject his poetry and success, thus keeping his artistic integrity intact, and decides to begin a new life with Gulabo.

With haunting songs, moody cinemaphotography and moving performances, not to mention a fabulous comic turn by the hilarious  Hindustani actor Johnny Walker (comedy being a necessary ingredient in any classic Bollywood ""masala""), ""Pyaasa"" becomes a meditation on art, the artist, commerce and their roles in society.  It is truly a masterpiece worthy of its legendary status.  Bahut achaa!",1264809600,,1425,5.416289592760181
