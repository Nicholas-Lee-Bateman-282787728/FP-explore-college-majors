8137549,4,B000H89VA0,"I was actually hoping to write a review on the seller and not so much on the video.  Nest videos does a great job on their videos.  It is a very good teaching video.  A little expensive, but still very good.  I took a short cut and ordered this used video through Amazon and even paid extra to have the shipping expedited.  I got the video a day late, but thankfully we were still able to use it.  The company never replied to me about the late delivery which is a little frustrating.",1300060800,2,484,4.150537634408602
8137550,1,B000H89VA0,"This particular product does not have the same quality of the other NEST movies such as the Good Samaritan, The King is Born, etc. The animation is horrendous and looks rushed. The voice acting isn't that much greater. Its only strong point is the fact that it illustrates Jesus' parables, and even then I think you're better off reading them from the Holy Bible.

Now, about NEST DVDs altogether: if you are considering purchasing the DVDs in order to modernize your collection from VHS, you should be aware that the NEST DVDs are altered from their original versions. Some lines have been taken out or changed altogether. I know because I had all the VHS tapes memorized, even down to the duplication warning at the beginning of each video.",1260230400,6,742,4.751937984496124
