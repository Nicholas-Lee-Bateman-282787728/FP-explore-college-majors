8563568,1,B00162BX2A,"While the first documentary about Florida Highwaymen and their art was fresh and inspirational (not to mention educational as well), the second movie is without the focus and is quite boring. I saw the documentary on PBS and am glad that I did not actually buy the DVD. Instead of building on the premise of first documentary, the second one does not provide any new relevant information of personal nature about these artists or their art. The script and the story are aimless, and there are even inserts from the first movie incorporated helter-skelter into this one. This disappointing documentary is sure not to enthuse the newcomers to highwaymen art or their story.",1214611200,2,671,4.946902654867257
8563569,5,B00162BX2A,This is an excellent documentary about the Florida Highwaymen artists. Compelling story about how these African-American artists struggled past the Jim Crow laws of the old south and escaped menial labor jobs by becoming artists. Their colorful landscape paintings are now in great demand by collectors. Very well done video. Very interesting throughout.,1208131200,,354,5.69811320754717
