8163882,5,B000059ZVQ,"A low-budget, gritty action-thriller about a bounty hunter looking to track down a deranged serial killer on the mean streets of Los Angeles. Lots of great action, lively characters, and Sherry Jackson as the hero's love interest! Worth checking out if you like your action movies without all of the Hollywood effects. Classic film-making on a budget!",1487289600,,351,5.175438596491228
