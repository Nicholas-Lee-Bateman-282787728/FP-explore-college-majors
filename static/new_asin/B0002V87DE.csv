8032493,4,B0002V87DE,"Smart film adaptation of Danny Hochs one man show, where he plays; rappers, white, black, Hispanic, successful and wanna be, prison inmates and prison guards, characters struggling with physical handicaps, and for a brief bit, even himself.  Hoch is certainly great with all the outer trappings  body language, voices, and he writes a lot of clever  and occasionally cutting  lines.

On the other hand, there are a lot of easy buttons pushed, and while it evokes emotions beyond laughter, it doesn't get as deep as I was expecting.  And one story, his own real life one about standing up to the people on Seinfeld and getting himself fired from an episode is seemed pretty self-aggrandizing.

They found an interesting way to film the show, cutting, often mid line between performing between 3 realities; Hoch in front of a regular audience, performing for a group of prison inmates, and into more fully staged versions of the same scenes, with other actors playing against him.  Again, this is a double edged sword.  It gives context to the bits, and is impressive technically, and shows how locked in Hochs act is.  But sometimes the technique bothered me as well.  It killed any illusion that there was anything alive, and in the moment' about the performance.  When youve got it down so tight that you can cut mid-sentence without it even feeling odd, to me that starts to feel like were watching a performance encased in amber.",1451779200,,1432,4.847736625514403
8032494,5,B0002V87DE,"I was an actor for 16 years, and Danny Hoch is one of the most talented human beings I've ever watched! Notice I said ""human being,"" because he strategically produced this material to draw empathy from the audience and makes you think about what these types of characters go through that exist in real life, and he couldn't have achieved it all unless he sincerely cared on a personal level. You will wish you could hug him after you watch it! I don't throw around the word brilliant often, but I do with this piece of art!",1386028800,,523,4.402061855670103
8032495,5,B0002V87DE,"For those of us who have been successfully curtailed by the media, with their hollywood plots to hypnotize and pacify us through mind-numbing movies and ""entertainment"".. and are now ready to be challeneged to think outside the box.. this film is for you!

For those who have a passion for social justice, human rights, freedom of speech and questioning ""The Man"".. this film is for you!

And for those of us who LOVE Hip-Hop.. who truly love it and believe in its purpose and artform; believe that is a vehicle for self expression and self exploration.. this film is definitely for you!

I had the pleasure of not only viewing the film, but also had a small part in its production, and I must say, the heart, the passion and honesty of this film and its creation are evident not only in the topics discussed in the film but also in the honesty of Danny Hoch's performance.

This film has surpassed ridiculous legal battles and is now being made available for all to enjoy. I recommend this film!!",1099958400,2,997,4.584269662921348

Someone asked the question what is HIP-HOP and someone answered:

""Hip Hop has thrived within the subculture of Black and Puerto Rican communities in New York and is now just recently beginning to enjoy widespread exposure. From a sociological perspective, Hip Hop has been one of the main contributing factors that helped curtail gang violence due to the fact that many adults found it preferrable to channel their anger and aggressions into these art forms which eventually became the ultimate expression of one's self"" - Davey D. ([...])

DANNY HOCH channels his anger and aggression in his art form, acting.  This MOVIE is hip-hop!  It illustrates factors blind to many and the characters within the movie are very ""moving"".

I had the opportunity to check out this film while it played shortly in select NY movie theatres.  This movie is HOT!  AND DANNY HOCH is amazing in this movie!  Support the movie that has survived a controversial, unnecessary battle.

I definitely recommend it.  If you think it's whack, feel free to e-mail me at:  sergio_lopezjr@yahoo.com and tell me it's whack.  I'd love to debate it with you.

8032497,5,B0002V87DE,"If anyone hasn't seen the illustrious ""Jails, Hospitals, and Hip-Hop"" then you don't know what you have missed. Danny Hoch, an actor, writer, and activist from Brooklyn, creates ten characters who have been affected in some way by hip-hop, the prison system, or life in general. What you find in his portrayal of these blindingly different characters that Danny plays is not only an energy from Mr. Hoch that is unparalleled, but an honesty that is usually dismissed in Hollywood. Danny has a sense of humor, a feeling of urgency, and a perspective that will make you do what every good movie should do: THINK.",1096761600,6,610,4.819047619047619
