4486605,3,B004WJT5EC,"This prequel is not as good as the sequel or the original! The jokes have already been played to death and you can't laugh but so much at all the recycled material! It was funny the first time and it was refreshing to have another laugh at it with part two! But, after awhile it gets old and so does Big Momma! The movie had its few funny moments but it wasn't convincing. The scenes which involved ""Charmine"" & ""Haley"" did nothing but drag out the story and cause me to yawn! At least we got a few action scenes and one dead corpse but overall I only give it 3 Stars!!",1300060800,,569,4.089285714285714

4486634,4,B004WJT5EC,"I'm almost embarrassed to report this, but I enjoyed it-- it was funny. I avoided seeing any of these flicks for years, but finally, my son's hunger for modern shtick drove me to watch all three of these with him (not in a row--thankfully). As one would expect, they are not great nor important movies...they're moronic. But, unlike so many comedies, these are actually funny AND have a coherent plot--BONUS! Perhaps so many other unfunny comedies have lowered the bar, but, this actually fulfills the requirements of a movie (good acting, clear plot, coherent writing) and we both found it funny. Of course, my kid watched it three times before the rental expired...I needed only one spin. :)",1481673600,,693,4.88135593220339

His boy sings in a band and Momma wants him to go to college.  He lets his son go with him to a college as under cover daughter. They both dress as a woman, and the show begins.

4486780,3,B004WJT5EC,Our 6y/o son LOVES this movie! He watches daily after school and on the weekends--forget it! But it's a fairly funny movie; I enjoy sitting and watching it with my son; I create teachable moments like a book/movie review.,1339545600,,221,4.6923076923076925
4486781,1,B004WJT5EC,"Man, I cannot believe that people can get away with making films this horrible these days!  EVERYTHING about this films sucks!  The story, the acting, the music, the plot, the fights, the cliches - EVERYTHING!  The only good things about this film are the sexy females in here.  If they were not in it, it would have been even harder to watch.  Fazon Love was the only good actor in the film and HE was the ONLY one funny in the film!  If he had not been in it, this film would have been even worse.  He is the only one who took his role seriously regardless of the poor production.

As many people point out about men (black ones in particular) dressing up like women being a part of a plot and designed to get people used to homosexuality and cross-dressing - I believe it!  I also believe that if some want a career in Hollywood, they must do things like this or be gone.  I also saw evidence of what they call child programming as Fazon Love wore his headphones as Mickey Mouse ears at the end of the film.  I am wearing DJ headphones as I type and I can tell you that it is hard to get those things in that position by accident.  It really seems what they say about Disney is true and about Hollywood in general!

As a film, this was poorly written, very poorly directed (it seemed homemade) and the acting seem more like rehearsals or auditions!  I TRULY hope that they do not make another one, but since this one made a profit, I am sure that they will.  To me, Big Mamma seems more like a cartoon or horror character than a comedy!  Big Mamma looks scary and the tacky wig has to go.  Why does it wear the same dress in every film?  Please - hire better screenwriters (me even), directors before you make another!",1339113600,,1721,4.226993865030675

This 1 is lacking some of the humor and comedy of it.
It is a good film and well worth watching. But I suggest watching part 1 first if you have never seen it.
It was much Much Better.

I couldn't wait for this to be aired so I could watch it then When I seen it I was glad I never Spent extra on it.

All in all yes I am sure I will watch it again. But it is not as funny as 1 and 2",1329264000,4,429,3.4123711340206184

Malcolm and Trent are forced to go undercover and disguise themselves as Big Momma and Charmaine at an all girls college. Big Momma becomes the new den mother to the Divas. At night, Big Momma is trying to find a flashdrive that can put a Russian gangster in jail for life. Meanwhile, Trent is slowly falling in love with Haley.

4486813,2,B004WJT5EC,"In search of entertainment, I chose to continue the 1st two ""Big Mama's"" by purchasing the last.  BIG Mistake!  More of a musical with teenagers, with a light love interest with the younger actor.  Sad to see Martin Lawrence have to stoop so low as to act in a seemingly low budget flick like this one.
It followed in the fashion of ""American Pie"" making WAY TOO MANY of what started out as a good thing.",1313712000,,404,4.2894736842105265

4486833,2,B004WJT5EC,"""How you gonna hide swag as big as this?""  After Malcom's (Lawrence) aspiring rapper step son Trent (Jackson) sees a murder it's up to Malcolm to hide Trent and find the evidence he needs to put the murderer in jail.  There is only one way to complete this...become Big Momma again.  After watching the first two I was actually kind of looking forward to this one. The first one was a good movie, but I thought the second one was funnier.  This one took all that was funny about the first two and replaced it with ""High School Musical"" aspects.  A lot of choreographed dance sequences and a lot of singing, not what I expected to see in this movie.  Although there were a few funny parts, the movie was a re-hash of the same jokes from the first two, but not as funny.  This is a perfect example of Hollywood running out of ideas and only doing re-makes, turning TV shows into movies, prequels and sequals that don't need to be made.  After a five year break another sequal to Big Momma didn't seem to be needed, and after watching this it only made that fact more clear.  Overall this movie does for the Big Momma series what ""Batman & Robin"" did to the ""Batman"" series, or what ""Rocky 5"" did to the ""Rocky"" series.  Makes you think...why didn't they stop at the last one? I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - No way, but like the other series I mentioned I would watch the others before this one if they were on TV.

*Also try - Big Mommas House 1 & 2",1307836800,,1456,4.216606498194946
4486834,4,B004WJT5EC,"I am not sure why this movie is getting so many bad reviews.

What I Can Tell You: I have seen all the Big Momma Movies and still crack up when I see Martin Lawrence as Momma/Malcolm. Come on, too funny.  Lawrence and Jackson are funny together. My favorite scenes were any that Jackson had to act like a chick with hot dorm girls walking around in towels. Classic comedy at its best. A dude in drag, done a hundred times, but still funny. Oh, and I have got to mention Momma does nude modeling. Hahahaha...hysterical.

Although I missed Nia Long, as Malcolm's girlfriend I thought as far as a third attempt goes, this was funny.

This is obviously not an Oscar worthy movie, but, if what you are looking for is a good time, a few laughs at hidden identity and some physical comedy, this is a good choice.",1305849600,10,805,4.346666666666667
4486835,5,B004WJT5EC,"Wow..this is my very first review...and what can i say...I don't understand why this movie is recieving so many negative reactions and reviews. I thought it was very funny and just an enjoyable movie. I actually like this one better than Big Momma's House 2. Martin Lawrence and Brandon T. Jackson have great chemistry both on-screen and off-screen,they are both comedians so the jokes were on point.(my opinion). Brandon T. Jackson replaced Jascha Washington after he declined to reprise the role of Trent, which in this movie,  due to the plot and his character having a leading role, he probably wasn't the best fit for the ""new"" Trent anyway as the storyline makes it out to be.(my opinion)

The plot: FBI agent Malcolm Turner(Martin Lawrence) and his 17-year old stepson Trent(Brandon T. Jackson) go undercover at an all-girls performing arts school after Trent witnesses a murder. Posing as Big Momma and Charmaine, they must find the murderer before he finds them.

The movie also stars Jessica Lucas(Haley),Portia Doubleday(Jasmine),and Faizon Love(Kurtis Kool).If you are a true Big Momma fan, you'll love this one!-----or maybe not, depending what YOU like.. Just give it a chance for once, I highly reccomend viewing this film if you love comedy!",1300492800,7,1257,5.121951219512195
