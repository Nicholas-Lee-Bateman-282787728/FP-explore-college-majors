The love story is there but there are numerous emotional vignettes concerning the effects of the war on all concerned from Greek, Italian and German military to the Greek civilian population. These impressionable glimpses into the human psyche burdened by loyalty and duty to one's homeland overshadow the love story. War brings out feelings and ambiguities of the conscience that can never be experienced in peacetime. That is really the strength of this film. I did not read the novel. Often comparisons of films made from novels can be a burden on the viewer providing that the viewer has read the novel prior to seeing the film. In some cases a film can actually improve on an idea that the novel did not exploit to its full potential. My reaction here is just to what I viewed in the film. As I watched this film I kept getting flashes of David Lean's RYAN'S DAUGHTER. It is similar in that a love story develops between a young Irish woman and a young British officer of the army occupying her homeland during the First World War. Both films also contain very many scenes on the beach and seashore. In RYAN'S DAUGHTER the primary focus was on the love story and not the war. I suppose I mention RYAN'S DAUGHTER because when I first realized that films were a passion with me and I wanted to really know why that was, RYAN'S DAUGHTER was the film I delved into looking for answers. Often you come away with more questions than answers. What makes a film good? Perhaps that is not a legitimate question. More importantly, what is there in a film that attracts it to you? What makes it work for you? I think that a film that evokes an emotional response from you is something to take note of and perhaps cherish at some point. These are some of the thoughts that kept surfacing as I watched CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN. I can't say that CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN is a film rich in character development. However, I go back again to the several vignettes that capture little snippets of conversation or a facial expression or body movement that reveals the soul and its true feeling of displeasure and hurt by the injustices of war that buries the rational mind and loving heart. For that alone I find CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN a film very worthy of your attention. Not since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has a war film touched that part of me. CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN is no SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but it does scrutinize and bring to the forefront another facet of the effects of that war and all wars. The DVD images are brilliantly and artistically realized making this a truly wonderful film.",1426464000,,2667,4.6405919661733614
