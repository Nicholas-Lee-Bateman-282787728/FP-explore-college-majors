1701959,5,B0000640RZ,"I saw this movie only once ten years ago and fell in love with it. I thought it was well acted and I could relate to Chantell's character. I love the music and I just loved the movie I knew every word by heart. All the things this girl goes through. Chantell deals with trying to live a life of her own but also having to take responsibility for her family life as well. She wanted her baby to be thrown in the trash. She always talks about going to college but with her additude she won't go anywhere.

It's ashamed that Ariyan A. Johnson is a forgotten about actress, she's a wash-up has-been.",1129939200,,595,4.219298245614035
1701960,4,B0000640RZ,"This movie really made you open your eyes and think about the consequences of sex. I saw it 10 years ago when I was sixteen and the movie really made me think twice about having sex. I just wish someone would make a movie like that in 2004 about
HIV/AIDS since people in the African-American community don't believe it can happen to them.",1086739200,6,338,4.380952380952381
1701961,5,B0000640RZ,"This movie was a great movie and in showing how young african-amercian girls try to live in the fast-lane and not think about the consequences that come with that lifestyle.

1701964,5,B0000640RZ,"This movie showed us life as it really is in the urban areas of the USA. This young lady had brains and beauty , with a mouth out of this world.

1702328,5,B0000640RZ,very good movie about the dangers of teenage pregnancy. this independent film is a warning to al young people about unprotected sex and pregnancy. Ariyan Johnson does an excellent job as a teenage girl making all the wrong choices.,1397001600,2,231,4.948717948717949

1702332,5,B0000640RZ,"This is truly one of my favorite movies...I have loved it ever since the first time I watched it (when my mom told me I was too young to be watching) This movie changed my life, basically taught me what I didn't want to go through, if I decided to have sex at a young age...Great Life lesson! MUST SEE",1311552000,7,301,4.033333333333333
1702333,5,B0000640RZ,"I've had this movie years and have watched it many times. This is Ariyah Johnson's film and what a performance she delivers! The supporting cast is excellent. The viewer is given a voyeur's perspective into the real world of teen life in America. The setting is urban, but the issues are rural and suburban. The professional reviewer wrote that the classroom scene is anti-semetic. What a lie! Although it appears that Chantell's teacher is Jewish,her issue with him is NOT his ethnicity, but the relevance of his lessons to her world. Not once does Chantell make an anti-semetic remark. Compare this film to ""Juno"" about a white girl about Chantell's age dealing with an out of wedlock pregnancy. I wondered if that filmmaker was not influenced by ""Just Another Girl on the IRT."" Like Chantell, Juno is sassy, intelligent, and not abandoned by the father of her unborn child. In the end, both Chantell and Juno decide not to abort their babies. ""Just Another Girl on the IRT"" is an important film: educational, entertaining and insightful. Had the filmmaker been given the budget that ""Juno"" had, this film could have been also received Academy Award recognition. I highly recommend this film to people of ALL ages and ethnicities. Perhaps it is didactic, but let us praise the filmmaker for giving us the lessons. Our families need these lessons<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B000YABYLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno (Single-Disc Edition)</a>.",1293580800,3,1514,5.502145922746781
1702334,5,B0000640RZ,"I watched this movie years and years ago. The entire movie is very interesting. Nowadays teenagers are concerned about the wrong things instead of thinking about the consequences of their actions. This movie is a great scare tactic if a mom wanted to allow her teenage daughter to watch it. Chantel, the main character in this movie makes horrible horrible choices that will affect her for the rest of her life. It will surely make you think before you act. It wasn't neccesarily based on a true story, but we all know things like this can happen and have happened.",1266192000,,565,4.66
1702475,5,B0000640RZ,"I stumbled upon this movie back in 2002 when I was in the 9th grade. It was on Blackstarz television. I was bored, and said ""What the heck, nothing else is on."" I am forever grateful for that, because this movie really sent out a message. Chantell was your typical teenager, but she had dreams of doing something with her life. And just like any other teen, she falls in love and doesn't use her head when she has unprotected sex with Tyrone. She is scared and hides her pregnancy and luckily at the end she kept the baby and attended school. Although, in reality the happy ending doesn't always or never will happen. I recommend teen girls and boys watch this movie. You can really learn something, I did :-)",1264291200,3,709,4.419847328244275
1702476,5,B0000640RZ,This was a good movie. It didn't have any scratches on it or anything. But the movie was really good. I love that movie. I hadnt seen that movie in a long time and i had to find it.,1248912000,,181,3.6666666666666665

1702478,5,B0000640RZ,I bought this movie for my daughter she loves it.  This is what happens when life throws you a curve and you are not ready even if you think you are. Young girls can learn a valuable lesson if they take this movie as reality. It can happen and has. You find yourself in a situation where you have to make adult decisions. I think all young men and women should watch this movie and take heed.,1224892800,3,392,4.090909090909091

1702483,5,B0000640RZ,"Do not buy this movie unless you are ready for a deep moving documentary!  My mom rented this movie for me one night several years ago when I was a teenager living in NY.  After viewing the movie I quickly ordered it from Blockbuster on VHS.  I cried several times while watching this movie not because it's sad but because it touched me.  It had everything a good movie should have laughter, sadness, excitement, happiness and most importantly LOVE!  I give this movie 10 stars!!! :)  I can't wait to buy this movie on DVD!  It is a very inspiring story and there is never a dull moment.  It is a very well done independent film that speaks to anyone who has gone through any kind of struggles in life.  This movie is about achieving your dreams and reaching your goals despite hurdles and mountains that come in your way.  It also shows growth and maturity in the life of a young woman.

Chantel was a typical teenager who had alot of dreams to become a doctor but she got pregnant. This movie really sends a message to parents with young daughter Chantel's age. We really need to talk to our children, instead of young girls doing what Chantel did they can go to there parents to talk about it.",1144972800,6,480,4.150537634408602
