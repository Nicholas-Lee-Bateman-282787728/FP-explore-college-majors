8197088,2,B000QRID1U,"This video mainly uses barbells, dumbbells, and machines, such as found in a gym. It isn't designed for use at home with minimal beginner-level equipment; Amazon's description of the video does not mention that. Since I have no access to gym equipment, this video was not useful for me. I am not qualified to rate it for gym members.",1378339200,,333,4.661016949152542
8197089,1,B000QRID1U,"you might think there would be some legitimate weightlifting advice here. nick evans is in good shape, after all, so his advice should be great, right?
the video only deals with the absolute basics of 14 or 15 exercises, and rushes through 3 workouts that use those exercises.
the total runtime of this video is about 50 minutes. it's much to short to explain either proper technique or a thorough routine.
actually, i would say technique is much more important than putting a routine together. and here, the video not only fails to deliver, but some of the information and the way the exercises are performed is just downright wrong. please please please don't try to do squats and shoulder presses the way shown in the video!

8197090,1,B000QRID1U,"This video was a disappointment.  It begins by showing several exercises with about five reps each.  It then shows each exercise done for 15 reps then 12 reps then 8 reps, the next exercise, 15, 12, 8, the next, 15, 12, 8 and on and on, and all from the same camera angle.  Much better would be to introduce an exercise with about five reps, show it from the side then from the back.  Show it a couple of more times pointing out specific parts of form that should be observed, ""make sure to do this, do that, do the other"".  Then show it a few times done wrong, ""don't do this, don't do that, and don't do this other"".  Having done this they could then instruct the viewer to do each exercise for 15 reps, then 12, then 8.  Here they offer five minutes of information crammed into an hour video.",1195430400,7,795,4.190789473684211
