7951547,2,B00005R2EK,"As a former dancer with NYCB during the Tallchief years, I was eager to view this videotape and revisit the greatness of this magnificent ballerina. Although television is hardly the best medium for dance, I was startled by the terribly confined space allotted to the dancers. Surely that contributed heavily to performances that were little more than the ""marking"" dancers do in rehearsals when they need to conserve their energy. Always a confident technician and musical performer, Tallchief looked self-conscious, awkward, and unsteady.  Perhaps she was uncomfortable dancing for cameras, not an unusual predicament for dancers used to a large stage and broad audience vistas. As her partner in the pas de deux of ""Scotch Symphony,"" Andre Eglevsky, who set virtuoso standards for American male ballet dancers in his prime, had little to do and less room to do it in. ""Allegro Brilliante"" was most disappointing of all. An inspiring ballet to dance and to watch under normal circumstances, this truncated version gave Tallchief no chance to show off her physical and temperamental brilliance. Hampered by unattractive camera angles, an annoying fabric ""set,"" and no room to move with music that is a joy for the performer, the ballet suffered, as I felt she must have. Better pass this one by.",1008028800,15,1296,5.14218009478673
