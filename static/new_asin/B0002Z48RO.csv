Eventually, the kids open up a new improved stand, while Midge Smoot teaches Schemer and Schemee a hard lesson about selling substandard goods!

Mister Conductor tells two Thomas stories: ""Donald & Douglas"" and ""The Deputation"", about when the twin engines Donald and Douglas first arrived at the Island of Sodor, and the trouble they caused.

The Jukebox Band plays the tune ""Erie Canal""

Note: This video is from the ""TV Teddy"" series, and includes featurettes preceding and following the Shining Time episode. The ""TV Teddy"" was an electronic toy teddy bear that would interact with these videos, and could actually ""talk"" to the TV. The audio gaps in the featurettes are actually ""cues"" that would cause the toy bear to say a phrase or make a sound. The Shining Time Station episode remains unaltered from it's original format and has no gaps. This video does not include the ""TV Teddy"" bear.",1339200000,2,1144,4.826530612244898
