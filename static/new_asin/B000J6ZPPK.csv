What a coincidence?",1376784000,,476,4.471264367816092

8149541,1,B000J6ZPPK,"I bought this box set thinking that if it costs more it must be real. Unfortunately it is very evident even before you open the box that it is fake. Even the pictures on the cover are clearly photo-shopped on (its kind of hilarious). Inside, it is just a bunch of sawdust (literally) with a plastic sleeve with the DVD's. However the DVD's do work and they include a bunch of extra bonus movies some not really even related to the original series but have similar actors/stories.",1360022400,2,479,4.517241379310345

8149543,5,B000J6ZPPK,"This is about the only place where you can buy almost all the 90's Y&D movies together. It comes in a nice box with 11 DVDs inside and 1 CD.  So if you are looking to buy and collect these movies, its a GEM of a deal! Just don't expect HD or Blue-Ray quality but movies are clear considering its age.  Actually I find ""Goodbye Mr Cool"" by Ekin to be in a league of its own, definitely one of the better triad movies from the HK 90's.",1259798400,,433,3.909090909090909
8149544,4,B000J6ZPPK,"First off, Goodbye, Mr. Cool and War of the Underworld are not part of the Y&D series. Also it is missing the movie Once Upon A Time in Triad Society, so this is not really a complete series set of Y&D films. There was a CD of music not mentioned in the description, so you do get something more then excepted.

The quality is good considering the age and technology used to make the first couple of movies. The subtitles for most of the movies did not work on my laptop but worked on the DVD player.

If your a Y&D fan or a fan of Hong Kong movies, this is a good buy.",1217721600,5,569,3.982456140350877
