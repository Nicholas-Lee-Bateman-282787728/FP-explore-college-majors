7904279,5,B000006GT9,"I have been wanting this video for a long time. I was hoping for a DVD release but gave up on that. The concert is in my hometown of Kansas City, one of REO's strongholds. The fans are great, the energy and enthusiasm onstage are-as always- unmatched, and the off-stage footage is priceless. (I didn't know I would get to see Kevin, Gary and Bruce in their underwear. :) The best part, though, is getting to hear REO performing songs that they don't do in concert anymore. REO has been my favorite band for over 30 years, but I never got to see them live until 2007. This video gives me a chance to experience a little of what I missed all those years.",1246406400,2,652,4.266129032258065

7904281,5,B000006GT9,"This video is so cool. Gee, I don't know how to describe it. It is just really cool. I just love watching all of those guys jam on stage. They are the best. I mean the best there is. Everyone who like Reo as much as me  should buy this video. It's the best.",956275200,,257,3.759259259259259
