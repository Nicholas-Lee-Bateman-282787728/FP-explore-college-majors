2143462,4,B0002YCVBU,"What a pleasant treat 964 Pinocchio is. I was always curious as to what the Japanese ""Cyberpunk"" Cinema scene was all about and now I at least have a little bit of an idea...maybe?

As an average person or moviegoer - what are you going to get out of 964 Pinnochio? You're going to get A LOT of people running around and the way it's portrayed makes you feel as if you're high on PCP. You're going to get incredibly uncomfortable moans, groans, and screams, CONSTANTLY, and some brutally gooey scenes of violence. Oh yeah, and ""NO PLOT!""

Basically, this movie is not for everyone. Definitely not. But for anyone who can see a film as a piece of art, put this in high regards! It is definitely a masterpiece of it's kind and culture! I, for one, have never seen anything like it. The speed-fused style of cinematography and editing will have anyone who can actually SIT through the whole movie feeling antsy and a bit dreadful! But you need to look at things the right way, any movie that can work it's way into your psyche like that and become a CHALLENGE to watch, is a GOOD THING! Some of the scenes with the wandering around camera reminded me of the sort of queasy feeling that the 2002 masterpiece IRREVERSIBLE provides.

I'm not going to say much else, other than that you need to expect an extremely abstract ride full of horrifying imagery, dreadful atmosphere, and ultra-violence...all at hyperspeed! I especially enjoyed the finale! 964 Pinocchio is certainly a masterpiece of it's own kind!",1207872000,2,1502,4.639097744360902
2143463,1,B0002YCVBU,"10 minutes of poor writing stretched to 97 minutes by bad acting with a 90 minute sound track of grunting, screaming, and gagging. Like getting on a bad ride after a bad meal. When it finally stops you still don't feel well and you regret wasting your time and money. I don't know what drug cyberpunks are on to enjoy this but thank you, I'll pass.",1180051200,,348,4.287878787878788
2143464,4,B0002YCVBU,"Like Tetsuo: The Iron Man this film takes you into a really bizarre, neurotic, and insane world where all of the normal conventions of cinema have been thrown out. In other words, you are either going to love this film or you are going to completely hate it. Personally, I am stuck somewhere in between those two extremes. This is by no means a perfect movie, but I really enjoyed it for what it was... or rather whatever you may wish to call it. The imagery was very abstract and, even though it felt like a Tetsuo rip off at times, there were still some pretty creative ideas within this film. I also liked how the entire film was shot in color instead of black and white. I think that too many of these types of movies rely too heavily on the stark atmosphere of black and white instead of exploring the vivid colors and imagery that can be projected in color. I especially liked seeing the actors freaking out in public. That was quite an amusing site to behold. How modest the Japanese are! I wonder how Americans would react to that. They stared at times, but for the most part they kept to their own individual business. I wonder what other bizarre events they ignore. Overall, if you are expecting a conventional movie with a storyline and a cast of well developed and likable characters, then look elsewhere. If you want to see an LSD trip of a movie, then this is going to be right up your alley, because the images on screen are just very bizarre and abstract. I guess that you could read into this film in any way that you choose. Ultimately, as a piece of art it is left open to interpretation. However, you have to look at the images in order to understand what this film is trying to say. So, with that in mind, this is a film that is told through images, not dialogue.",1161475200,,1784,4.344311377245509
2143465,4,B0002YCVBU,this was a very good film if you are looking for something completely awkward. lots of nonsense that makes it so unique however still the similarities to this and tetsuo the ironman are obvious. only thing  i didn't like was that it seemed to drag on a bit much like tetsuo but i love how these japanese actors pull off the delusional acts.  not enough lesbian action if you ask me. i like the extra short as well,1156464000,,413,4.282051282051282
2143466,5,B0002YCVBU,"Yowza!!!  This is an amazing flick from Shozin Fukui (Rubber's Lover).  This baby is filled to the brim with kinetic energy that'll blow the unsuspecting viewer away.

Previously residing in the lonely world of bootleg video, Unearthed Films released this fantastic edition on DVD.  The image quality is something magnificant to behold.  For a film shot on 16mm, the restoration is quite breathtaking.  I couldn't believe how amazing it looked.

For me, this film isn't really about the story, it's about the experience of watching it, and it's one hell of a ride.  Fukui has an impressive eye (I wish he crank out a few more films) and even though he was working within the limited aspect ratio of 1:33:1, he still manages to capture some striking compositions.  His creative use of cinematography creates a very chaotic and unstable world that can become unhinged (which it usually does) at any given moment.  His use of sound and performaces from fearless actors will further test of audiences' boundaries of sanity.

I saw this before I saw Tetsuo: The Iron Man, which many people accuse this film of ripping off.  No way!  This baby is a completely different animal.  In many ways, I think Pinocchio 964 emerges as a better film.  At the very least, it lives within its own creative world and I'm very happy that I can finally view it as it was meant to be seen!

Check it out!",1137110400,3,1382,4.695833333333334
2143467,5,B0002YCVBU,"I going to speak to a specific audience of reader right now, and you will know who you are. You saw Tetsuo: The Iron Man years ago, and it burnt itself ito the circuitry of your brain. You watched it many times, and showed it to friends; but no matter where you looked, or what you watched, you never got the same high as you did that from watching Tetsuo. Perhaps you watched Tetsuo 2, and were disapointed; perhaps you watched Tokyo Fist, and it just wasn't the same. You watched other films by other Japanese directors, but nothing could rise to the delerious cyberpunk heights of Tetsuo...

Until now...

The Second coming has arrived...mmmm, apparently in 1992!

If Tetsuo was your cup of slime and blood, this will get you off hard. And let me tell you, this is not just some Tetsuo wanna be, a Tetsuo clone. This is a film with a world all of it own. It has a totally different aesthetic, totally different textures, totally different themes and subthemes. This is a wild, hardcore, punk rock trip into the dark side, and I loved it.

The actors go places that blew me away. Like they jacked straight into the Id, and their performances show a level of commitment that no American actors would ever dare take themselves. It seems like they are all tripping hard on LSD or some types of psychodelics. The director is incredibly self confidant, and wants to ""show you"" his world, not explain it will dialogue. He has his roots in some strange punk, noise rock underground scene, and he incorporates this sensibility into the film.

The use of sound in the film is truly unique, and help build layers of (un)reality. The film takes some serious twists and turns that will satisfy the philosophical side of your nature. One of the coolest part for me, was that most of the film seems to have been film (guerilla style) in public!, without permission, mostly in stores and subways. It really tickles me to wonder what people must have been thinking to have seen these freaks going nutz while they were on the way to work. If you watch, you can see some pretty shocked looks on their faces, but, weirdly enough, most people just keep walking.

This movie is a new personal favorite of mine. It lean, mean, punkrocking subversive machine- but strangely sweet.

Oh, and did I mention that this DVD has a short film on it (a rather long short film) called Caterpillar by the same director, which also is wild and weird and waiting to rock your world.

I also have found out that the director shot a prequel to this film a number of years later, and it is supposed to be every more offensive and violently psychotic! It is called Rubber's Lover and it also available on DVD. I will review that one after I have bought and watched it.

I'm speaking to you, and you know who you are. Get this, see this...I'll see you on the other side.",1135900800,8,2831,4.492217898832685
2143468,5,B0002YCVBU,"This is what filmmaking, and art, is supposed to be.

  Take two parts H.R. Giger, two parts all things Punk, two parts Akira Kurosawa, mix together and serve and you've got a film from Japan that is a classic of non-mainstream filmmaking.

  The director of this film, in a very informative interview conducted in 2001 for the DVD release of this 1991 film, tells of the work he did in the 80s during his college years and after for a production company for 3 years straight filming contemporary art.  Most people don't devote the time and energy into making a feature length film, it takes alot more time, energy, effort, sleepless nights, & devotion than writing a review about a film.  Anyone who makes a film this strange has done so for a reason: the man lives for art, and it shows in his film.

  This film is a truly original product or a very original mind.  It certainly has influences from Tetsuo: The Iron Man, but stands on its own while being a complement to Tetsuo: The Iron Man.

  Visually and even thematically, you could say this is the what happens if Akira Kurosawa was borns in the 60s, became a punk rocker and went into filmmaking.  For all you've heard, in form this is classic storytelling.  Afterall, it is called Pinocchio, and it is really a cyberpunk retelling of a classic fairytale.  Remember that and for all it's wierdness it will make sense.

  For anyone who is a true fan of H.R. Giger's work, you will enjoy this film.  If you like Brian Eno's ambient music, Industrial music, you've got to see this film just for its awesome soundtrack.

  If people want deep characters, they should watch a film adaptation of Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.  Fairytales don't have complex characters, but they work, and so does this film.  This film does have charcter development, and the characters do change, or maybe different sides of them come out.

  This is an emotional film.  The characters explode with fear, pain, love, perversity, intelligence, fun.  This is a visually awe-inspiring, thought-provoking, funny, and touching film.",1131235200,,2067,4.735211267605634
2143469,1,B0002YCVBU,"Don't believe the good reviews.  This movie is terrible.  Sure a lot of people are sick of the repeating Hollywood formulas but being outside of that does not mean anything about whether a movie is good or not.

I can tell you the entire story very quickly.  And I am not exageratting that this is the ENTIRE story.

A mad scientist creates sex androids and sells them to rich older women.  One women is not happy with her sex android Pinocchio, wipes his memory, and throws him out into the street.  The scientist is worried because he doesn't want his underground business to become known to the general public so he sends his employees looking for Pinocchio.

There is a woman looking around with binoculars in the streets who Pinocchio falls onto.  She starts taking care of Pinocchio and claims she has amnesia as well.

The remainder of the movie has Pinocchio violently spewing blood for unexplained reasons,  then unexplained different colors of sticky substances for no explained reason.

Then the girl starts acting wacky as well and turns on Pinocchio.  A whole lot of spewing of unexplained strange substances for about 45 minutes with the girl fighting with him all for unexplained reasons.

Then the employees finally find Pinocchio 964 with her.  They try to kill her but she can not be killed.  Pinocchio escapes but for some reason the place he really is going is actually to the location of the mad scientist (while pulling a huge cement triangle that the girl chained him to.)

When he gets there, they fight, various people spew strange substances for some unknown reason including the employees that Pinocchio is destroying.  The girl urges Pinocchio to take off his face (again without explained reason) but instead takes off her own when Pinocchio refuses.  When she does this, now she has a big ugly rock-covered-in-mud-looking face that measures about 3 feet in diameter.  Pinocchio beheads her and puts the head on his own head.  The word ""END"" appears and the credits role.

I wish I was leaving the things out that would explain what all this is about.  I am not.

I have heard a lot of vague praise about how ""innovative"" this movie is.

My assumption is that it is called ""innovative"" because the ENTIRE movie is made in annoying jump cuts.  If the jiggling camera of Blair Witch excites you, perhaps you will be more elated by an entire 2 hours of jump cuts.

I guess the other ""asset"" this movie has would be that it old ""lets the viewer interpret for himself"" the meaning of this mess.

If you are looking for some of that currently hot edgy Japanese cinema, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this one.

If you are still willing to see this film after all I said, find a way to rent it instead of buying it first.

I guess there are a lot of people who really liked this film, but if what I described sounds bad, I don't think I have even begun to properly explain how bad this movie is.",1120262400,17,2935,4.577735124760077

8034664,4,B0002YCVBU,"Nine Things About the Film ""964 Pinocchio""

1. This is considered to be a cyberpunk film. I personally wouldn't call it cyberpunk - it's unclassifiable. But cyberpunk is the closest genre to whatever this movie is.

2. It's usually compared to Shinya Tsukamoto's revolutionary cyberpunk classic ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"". ""964 Pinocchio"" isn't very much like ""Tetsuo"", except in its visual style. It's a very kinetic and speed-edited, unexplainable film.

3. It's about a male sex slave named 964 Pinocchio who can't keep an erection, so his mind is wiped and he is thrown onto the streets. He is found by a girl named Himiko, who has her own memory problems and is trying to make a map of the entire city. Himiko goes crazy, imprisons Pinocchio and begins tormenting him. Meanwhile, the corporation that makes the sex slaves decides they better go find Pinocchio. Then things get weird.

4. Some of the scenes in the film are very creative and unique. There are surreal images and sequences that hit deep parts in you. Some of the scenes in the film are really dumb, and remind me of drugged-out college students trying to make performance art, or are trying to be shocking just to be shocking.

5. It took me awhile to recognize that this movie is kind of a twisted retelling of some of the themes in the actual Pinocchio story.

6. The girl that plays Himiko is not a very good actress. But in a movie like this, I don't suppose it matters much.

7. This movie probably has the longest vomit scene of any movie I've watched.

8. People scream a lot in this movie, and yell at each other. That might be part of the reason why the alternate title for this film is ""Screams of Blasphemy"".

9. This isn't a great film, but for those people who enjoy cyberpunk, or who like films that explore the edges of both cinema and reality, it's definitely worth watching.  Just don't expect to really understand it.",1425081600,4,1901,4.597633136094674

8034666,4,B0002YCVBU,"Wow this was one weird movie. I have never in my life seen anything like this. This is not the Disney Pinocchio we all grew up watching. This movie is so messed up you won't believe it. Pinocchio is a lobotomized cyborg sex slave, and is thrown out onto the street by his owners. Pinocchio meets up with this homeless girl named Himiko. Then Pinocchio's creator sends out his men to get rid of Pinocchio. This is one really strange movie though. It's pretty low budget, but in a good way. I liked all the weird camera angles too. I think the best part was when Pinocchio ran down the streets screaming. That was just weird and freaky! I bet all those people were freaked out when they saw this thing running. Did I mention the ending is also weird as heck. If you're looking for a weird movie to watch, then you'll enjoy Pinocchio 964. There's nothing out there quite like this. 9/10 from me.",1294876800,2,892,4.379518072289157
8034667,2,B0002YCVBU,"964 Pinocchio (Shozin Fukui, 1991)

In case you were wondering, the square root of 964 is 31.048349392520047457724923534346.... I know this because I became curious while watching 964 Pinocchio. (It's actually ""the square root of 964 Pinocchio"", but I'm too lazy to look up the alt code for the square root sign, and it probably won't show up right on Amazon anyway.) What this has to do with this odd little film, the first feature-length piece from Rubber's Lover director Fukui, I've no idea. In any case, I'll tell you right now that this is one of those movies you will either love or hate; there seems to be no middle ground.

There is a plot to it, though it's so over the top that at times you may wonder if it's really still a plot at all. A sex slave (Haji Suzuki, who never acted again) is ejected from the bordello of his keepers and finds himself wandering the streets, where he runs into a cute, though crazy, lass named Himiko (Onn-chan, again in her only screen appearance). While she finds him a bit creepy at first, she eventually warms to him. (It is she who dubs him Pinocchio while they're on a quest to discover his identity.) The two of them traipse around trying to figure out who (and why) they are, while the company who created Pinocchio sends out extermination squads to get rid of him; he is, after all, defective merchandise.

It's not like there's no precedent for something like 964 Pinocchio, especially in Japan; this is really nothing more than the psychedelic movies of the seventies taken to extremes. Think Hausu or Corman's The Dunwich Horror or Kenneth Anger's sixties and seventies flicks, for example. Pinocchio just updates the psychedelic feel with the feel of the drugs more common during the time frame (ecstasy and crack) and has much better special effects. It's the same kind of rambling plot, the same odd, stilted dialogue, the same odd lack of resolution despite there being a pretty solid climax (once again I refer you to The Dunwich Horror for an idea of what I'm trying to get at there). Conceptually, it's not a bad little film at all. But theory and practice often differ. Fukui has no sense of pace at all, leading to long parts of this movie dragging when they should be snappy, and some of the less action-oriented bits feeling way too rushed. It tips the balance, in my opinion, from an average-to-good flick to an average-to-bad flick, which is too bad; there are a lot of interesting ideas here. **",1286409600,,2462,4.6422018348623855

But like i said it wasn't the best horror movie ive seen. It was interesting though. But ill say it opne more time its not the best.

8034669,1,B0002YCVBU,"Japanese cyberpunk horror is a hit-or-miss sub-genre. On the one hand we have highly entertaining movies like ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" (1989) and ""Rubber's Lover"" (1996), while on the other hand we have feats of mediocrity like ""Hellevator"" (2004) and ""Meatball Machine"" (2005) or poorly made crapfests like ""Death Powder"" (1986). Rest assured that ""Pinocchio 964"" safely rests within the category of ""poorly made crapfest.""

A woman meets a sex slave who is accidentally released into the outside world. The problem with this movie is quite simply this: there is too much time wasted on drawn-out, uninteresting, stupid, disgusting events. For example, the woman attempts to teach the slave how to speak by repeatedly saying ""Pinocchio"" dozens of times. She does this over and over and over again until the viewer is ready to shove a wooden nose through her forehead. In another scene, she walks around aimlessly while vomiting profusely. Nicely disgusting indeed, but did we really need to see her repeatedly throw up a dozen times? In yet another scene, good ole Pinocchio runs through the streets hysterically for an incredibly long period of time. Are you serious?

I understand and greatly appreciate the fact that Japanese cyberpunk throws away conventional, formulaic film-making standards and goes for a shot to the heart in terms of a no holds barred visual/audio assault on the senses. That's why I love ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" (directed by Shinya Tsukamoto) and ""Rubber's Lover"" (directed by Shozin Fukui, the same director of this film) - they have boatloads of awesome, exceptionally cool visuals for the viewer to chew on. These aren't your typical ""crazy"" movies with characters acting stupid the entire time. On the contrary, you get wickedly stylish nightmare sequences that blend horrific technology with biological flesh; or Frankenstein-like awakening sequences with psychic antagonists fitted in black rubber suits. Every assault is handled with precision, lasting long enough to leave an impression without provoking irritation. These films are the very essence of successful experimental film-making. Breathtaking stuff!

Unfortunately, ""Pinocchio 964"" reminds us more of Tsai-ming Liang in its habit of shamelessly filming completely pointless, dull-as-dirt moments for incredibly long periods of time. The only difference is that where Tsai chooses to film a person peeing into a plastic bag for 5 minutes, Fukui chooses to film a woman vomiting profusely for 5 minutes. Both methods will incite record-setting levels of frustration and irritation on the part of the viewer. These types of films are not just poorly made by conventional standards, they're poorly made by ANY standard. Being weird (in and of itself) does not guarantee an entertaining film. ""Pinocchio 964"" serves to remind us of this.

I find it incredibly interesting how so many people fail to apply logical standards to films that fly outside conventional film-making techniques. It would seem that dramas and romances are the only genres of film where viewers go in with a defined set of standards (e.g., acting, story lines, etc.). Trot out a no-brain action movie, and everyone gets confused. Instead of everyone rating those films based on the quality of the action scenes (the only logical way to go), we get snobs trashing every no-brain action film in existence (regardless of how well the action is executed) while fans of the genre rate every movie highly (regardless of how badly the action is executed). In like manner, fans of Wuxia films will never admit that a Chinese swordplay movie made in the 1980s or early 1990s was poorly made, while fans of the Classics seem to think that every film made before 1970 is a ""masterpiece."" There is something seriously wrong with all of these people.

Am I the only living person on the planet who can be a fan of almost every genre of film while maintaining some semblance of quality control? It's really not that difficult to watch and love a Yasujiro Ozu film one night, only to then watch and love a Prachya Pinkaew movie the next night. Different standards apply, and while movie-watching is ultimately subjective, viewers would be wise to apply some semblance of standards in every genre. That way, we don't end up mixing garbage like ""964 Pinocchio"" or ""Eraserhead"" with truly scintillating fare like ""Rubber's Lover"" and ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man.""",1233792000,4,4398,5.15406162464986
