8289744,1,B001CUB9WU,Boo hiss. Not even close.,1475539200,,25,4.2
8289745,3,B001CUB9WU,"One of the all-time great stories re the French revolution; however, the quality of the film is poor.
The resolution is most probably the worst I have ever seen.",1463184000,,161,4.586206896551724
8289746,1,B001CUB9WU,"This is not the 1935 movie, as I thought when I bought it. This is a made-for-TV special from 1953, the ""Plymouth Playhouse."" Besides the fact that is erroneously marketed, the video and audio quality are terrible.",1423526400,,214,4.8108108108108105
8289747,1,B001CUB9WU,I was very disappointed with this film.  It was not restored and I was unable to watch it even though Wendell Corey was a favorite actor of mine.,1408665600,,145,4.178571428571429
8289748,1,B001CUB9WU,hard to hear or follow due to the sound quality and the lighting.  Tough to really say if the acting is good or not because of the unwatchability of the video.,1388188800,,159,4.129032258064516
8289749,4,B001CUB9WU,"Yes, this is a 'creaky' early-television production, which of necessity (time) guts most of Dickens' great novel. And certainly the kinescope quality of nearly 60 years ago doesn't fly by today's high-def standards. Nevertheless, this is more than worth a look thanks to the casting of Wendell Corey as Sidney Carton, Corey is one of those unsung heroes of American movies, a character actor who seldom landed a leading role but whose presence always elevated anything he appeared in. (Maybe the fact that he was himself an alcoholic---he would die in his 50s of liver ailments---made him especially appropriate to portray the noble wastrel Carton). Here he gives a quietly effective, no-frills performance scaled to the small screen and the one-hour time constriction. Also of note, the crowd-scenes in Paris are pretty impressive for a live, stage-bound TV production from 1953. Sum up: worth it for Wendell, or, if like me, you're a fan of early TV.",1320278400,4,952,5.070063694267516
8289750,3,B001CUB9WU,I really was looking for the movie not the TV version. I brought back memories.,1239580800,,79,4.333333333333333
8289751,1,B001CUB9WU,"Despite the packaging on the box and DVD, this movie does NOT contain the Ronald Coleman classic as labeled.  Instead it contains a recording of the 1952 ABC Network ""Plymouth Showcase"" version, with lesser actors, complete with commercials for the 1953 Plymouth.",1230422400,8,263,5.261904761904762
8289752,5,B001CUB9WU,If you like old movies with great actors this is the one to purchase. Ronald Colman is a holywood icon and will remain so for many years. It;s a geat movie with a moral that is timeless.,1226793600,2,186,4.054054054054054
