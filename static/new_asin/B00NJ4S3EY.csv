6660788,5,B00NJ4S3EY,"After just half a season last year, Chicago PD came back strong, with the Intelligence Unit involved in many interesting cases, dealing with major drug busts, a nationwide child pornography ring, and other weighty issues.

What's more, the writers have greatly expanded the characters' various backstories. Some shows would have viewers waiting for years on end to learn so much about what makes the characters tick; but Chicago PD puts just as much focus on the personal as the professional. Season 2 puts a great emphasis on the childhood of Det. Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush), who was taken in as a teenager by Sgt. Hank Voight (Jason Beghe). Erin's mother Bunny (Markie Post), a former drug addict, returns with the claim that she wants to reconnect with her daughter. Erin, however, quite naturally has her doubts about whether Bunny is to be trusted. We also delve into the psyche of the often gruff and violent Voight, learning more about his strong love for Erin, his turbulent relationship with his son Justin (Josh Segarra), his deceased wife Camille and his relationships with his long-time partner Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas) and other officers.

Other members of the police department, including Det. Antonio Dawnson (Jon Seda), Adam Ruzek (Patrick Flueger) and Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati) have their own brushes with death, career choices and personal relationship tangles. And of course, desk Sgt. Trudy Platt (Amy Morton) is usually on hand, giving her colleagues a sharp piece of her mind, tinged with her own special brand of sarcastic humor.

Since i watched the first episode that I watched I was in love with Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush's Character) I started becoming in love with the cast as they had so amazing acting skills.  I followed the cast on social media. I love live tweeting with them. I even got my grandpa hooked on the show. Now we watch it together every week.  This show has such great stories with such great writing. The end of season 2 with Sophia Bush. Oh my. She was freaking amazing. She excelled the whole storyline. Now in Season 3 it got so much better. There was so much more action and it was such better stories. My favorite episode is the Jay centric episode, I love how it portrayed him. It made me fall in love with Jesse Lee Soffer. Such a good show. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Law and Order!

6661289,5,B00NJ4S3EY,"This is such an engrossing show. Every episode is full of drama, good intelligence action and a backstory involving one of the main characters. Hank Voight is one marvellous character. As tough as nails with some questionable tactics he has a loyalty to his team that is tremendous to watch. We all know he'd take a bullet for any of them.

Erin Lindsay played by Sophia Bush is complex and we learn more of her history during this series. Her struggles with her mom and the familial relationship with Voight add to the Intelligence Unit action. And you don't want to miss the season ending.

Trudy Platt who mans the desk downstairs of the station plays a pivotal role in linking the upstairs Intelligence Unit and downstairs uniformed crew. She adds depth to the show due to the compassion she provides which can often be lacking in such shows.

One aspect of this series I particularly love is how they do episodes combining other Dick Wolf shows, Chicago Fire (naturally) and Law and Order (SVU). The episodes involving the SVU crew is outstanding and watching the dynamics between Olivia Benson and Voight is worth the price alone. Two superb characters working side-by-side was fabulous.

Can't wait for season 3.",1444003200,6,1219,4.818181818181818

6661304,4,B00NJ4S3EY,"There are too many cop shows on Television. Most of them are ridiculously inaccurate. Some are just SILLY. (Hawaii 5-0/Rookie Blue). This series is as close to  the gritty NYPD BLUE as you will get. But the interesting thing about this show is that in Season 2 NBC let the directors and special effects go full on with Action sequences that would NEVER have passed NBC ""standards and practices"" only two years ago.  There is actual blood shown on gun shots. One episode showed a knife cutting out a bullet lodged in a chest wall (and effects done very well). The WALKING DEAD series had a huge effect on what is now allowed on television. In the Days of ""HUNTER"" or MIAMI VICE NBC used to COUNT the gunshots per episode and had specific guidelines on how many episodes per season gun impact shots ( blood squibs) were allowed. In most cases they were NOT allowed.  Only a scant number of old NBC police/action series were allowed to show any blood or realistic fights. It was not the fault of the writers or producers there really used to be censors who would ""nix"" anything too violent.

There are few ""extras"" on the DVD release so 4 stars. I wonder why current TV release features so little in terms of out takes/alternate shots/ teasers/previews to next week/ or network sales presentations.

The producers of CHICAGO PD are aware of this and I see them using the loosening censorship as a way to incorporate more realistic, engaging and harrowing action scenes that used to be reserved for ""R"" rated films. I am not going to comment on the characters or hoe ""realistic"" they are. In truth..there are NO Police television series that actually mimic how a real take down or shoot out. In the REAL WORLD a cop unloads his clip at a perp shooting at him. 8 or more shots..depending on weapon choice. On these television shows a cop fires ONCE ot TWICE. You have no idea if a perp will GO DOWN in one or two shots, if they are wearing body armor, If they are on drugs..so let's not call this show ""totally realistic"". (Obviously showing cops unloading a full magazine weekly will make some unions unhappy)  But compared to the cartoon like other  current crime shows *(what happened to the days of  Kojak or Dragnet?>)..this one has solid acting, writing, and action. Well worth the watch.",1442275200,,2289,4.5931372549019605

She was so excited, and I was happy that she got to see Chicago and what a great city it is! I love that this show is made here, and I love being able to recognize some places where they are in certain episodes. Can't wait for Season 3 to start!",1434153600,2,558,4.036036036036036
