8357721,5,6302362822,"This video is surprisingly good. One of best I've seen.  The tittle is misleading as this is an instruction video totally devoted to hitting a baseball.  Lou Piniella works hard in this video.  He takes a no-nonsense  approach to teaching, and doesn't try to overwhelm you  with his ""own  importance"".  Piniella presents many drills and checkpoints that you  can verify that you (or the people you are instructing) are in the correct  position at certain parts of the swing.
The production itself is good  quality and has some interesting special effects.",947808000,3,555,5.0
