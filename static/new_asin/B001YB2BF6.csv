3829622,1,B001YB2BF6,"This movie to me seemed to be made very low budget.  The conversations were lacking intrest on my part.  It dragged on and to me had no plot.  Grant it others may think differently.  It reminded me of The Blair Witch Project.  The first make of it.  I was completly bored by it and kept skipping forward in hopes of finding something intresting to keep my attention but nothing.  I was very dissappointed in it.  But, then again thats just my opinion.  Don't waste your time or money on it.",1283040000,,490,4.355555555555555
3829623,4,B001YB2BF6,"I guess Gay life in China is just emerging from the shadows. This movie I understand is one of the first Gay moives. It is all very tastefully done and kind of shy but it gets it's point across. It shows the sadder side of that life. Two ships passing each other at sea.
Nice looking people but the father is not much to be admired. I am glad I bought it. As
time goes on the Chinese movies may get bolder.

3829631,2,B001YB2BF6,"I felt like they really could've done something with this, but instead went nowhere. The main character had an amazing actor and I believe they gave him a mental illness as well. Instead of explaining some more things, it was just an hour and a half of confusion. I was really looking forward to this, but unfortunately, I was very disappointed",1358035200,,344,4.655737704918033
3829632,4,B001YB2BF6,Again one is given a look into the culture of another country.  A father has to deal with his son and his own thoughts about homosexuality.  It can be almost parallel to some parents in America even though this is shot in a different country.  It was easy to watch and enjoyable.,1353974400,2,279,4.326923076923077
3829633,3,B001YB2BF6,"Seemed like a movie out of a Smiths album. Pensive. Worth seeing again. It's good to see movies coming out of China, although they are still conservative by Western standards.",1342569600,,175,4.866666666666666
3829634,2,B001YB2BF6,I felt this film wasn't as fluid and strong as i hoped it would be. It had a good concept and theme with the two main characters but it wasn't portrayed as well. I thought the dialogue was weak and the acting was too simple. It could have turned out to be a great movie because it had a good concept and message but it lacked a lot of messing things to make it a complete movie.,1329091200,,378,3.9220779220779223
3829635,5,B001YB2BF6,"Through the many, and deliberate, slow scenes in this movie (for instance, instead of a person moving at regular pace he is instead moving slowly to get to that end point), this movie will slow you down so that you can feel the tenderness of the key actor, you can feel the intimate thoughts of all of its actors -- giving you a chance to understand and feel what's in the  microcosm of this actor's life.  I highly recommend that you watch this movie.  I can watch it over and over, and probably will watch it later tonight again.",1324944000,5,531,4.343434343434343

8348018,2,B001YB2BF6,I don't mind subtitles and like foreign films. This could not keep my attention. It could have been edited into a short film. Too many long scenes with nothing happening. I gave up half way through.,1520121600,,198,4.527777777777778

8348021,1,B001YB2BF6,To many long gaps of actionless scenes; it would have been better if there were flashbacks of the young boy growing up,1474848000,,118,4.409090909090909

8348023,5,B001YB2BF6,"This movie is muted, melancholic, beautiful, poetic, quiet. It calls out attention to the wonders of bodies, sky, love, thoughts and feelings too complex and paradoxical to speak (or the inarticulateness of people, families, friends, love). It doesn't inspire me to joy and action, but rather reflection on the beauty and preciousness of life in all it's tenderness and sadness.
For the thoughtful and poetic.",1472342400,,409,5.3076923076923075

8348025,4,B001YB2BF6,I like this film for its sheer boldness in showing male nudity in Chinese film making.  It is sensual with lots of beautiful nude shot.  The film develops the three main characters slowly and at the end of the film we see how they change.,1446076800,2,238,4.266666666666667
