8611817,5,B004ESMO76,"I ordered this for our small group Sunday School class for Advent.  Rev. Robertson's teachings are profound, Biblically-based, and theologically sound.  We found the DVD to be most engaging and discussion questions to be highly-relevant to our Christian journey during this season of reflection and expectation.  What isn't mentioned in these reviews are the beautiful period paintings that are shown throughout the DVD to illustrate the content of the nine Advent scriptures readings.  These, combined with the fine choirs, are beautiful enough in themselves to merit including this DVD in your Advent/Christmas collection.  The second disk, a CD of additional music from Lessons and Carols with orchestra, lives in my car now and it, in itself, was worth the price of this first-rate collection.",1291680000,2,797,5.395161290322581
8611818,5,B004ESMO76,"I have been a fan of the Service of Lessons and Carols since my childhood.  Participating in the service as both a listener and a singer many many times, I am delighted that the service has taken a firm root in American churches.  Christ Church, obviously, has an oustanding Music Ministry and in this, has apparently produced the first DVD of Lessons and Carols in the states.  I found the production to be both beautifully put together and charming.  The teachings on each reading by a knowledgeable priest are a nice addition as is the included CD recording of additional music from the service.  (Note: I found excerpts from this DVD on You Tube while surfing the internet on this topic.)  Get this one...you won't regret your purchase.",1291507200,,740,4.7421875
