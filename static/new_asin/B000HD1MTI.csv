8138631,4,B000HD1MTI,"Perfect in Ten: Abs is forty-three minutes and was released on DVD on November 14, 2006. The DVD is divided into four parts: Stretch, Lower Body, Upper Body, and Abs. There are two vertical bars to the right of the screen. For the Stretch segment the green bar tells you how many seconds you have left in the stretch and the pink bar tells you have much time is left in the segment. For the Lower Body, Upper Body, and Abs segments the green bar tells you the count for each exercise and the pink bar tells you have much time is left in the segment. The first three segments are relatively easy and a beginner will have little difficulty in doing them. However, once you get to the Abs segment that is a little more intense and I did not know how many ways one could do a crunch. When I got to the last two crunches, crunches (with raised crossed legs) and crunches (legs & arms raised), I basically threw in the towel. Below for the Lower Body, Upper Body, and Abs section are the names of the exercises and how many times for that exercise. In the end the body does get a good workout and Perfect in Ten: Abs gets a B+.

8138632,5,B000HD1MTI,I like this dvd.  You don't need a bunch of extra equipment.  I saw other reviews where they say it looks like she's right out of the 70's.  So what?  I love the meter on the side that shows how long you have to go before that exercise is over.  That really helps when you're doing an exercise that's really tough; you know you can make it by watching the meter.  I like the way the exercises are organized.  I have several workout dvd's and this is one I use regularly.,1226793600,5,470,4.0989010989010985
8138633,5,B000HD1MTI,"This DVD immediately became a mainstay in my fitness collection.  It really is much more than abs, and I must say that the title is rather misleading.  This is actually an excellent total body workout.  There are 4 segments - 1. Stretch, 2. Abs, 3. Buns & Thighs, 4. Upper Body (note: this segment does use small handweights).  Each segment last 10 minutes.

The exercise routine was developed by Andy Troy, CSCS, and initially I purchased this DVD looking for the female equivalent of his ""Bedroom Workout"" for men.  I was not disappointed.  The exercises are simple and efficient, and the routines are well-designed for flow.  Tanna Valentine, who demonstrates the exercises, has a lovely calm presence and describes the movements simply, safely and clearly.  Whether I am doing these exercises first thing in the morning or last thing at night, her serene manner is refreshing, and not gratingly over-enthusiastic like so many fitness instructors.

For the most part, I prefer to go to the gym to work out.  But, for days when that is simply not possible, this workout helps to keep me on track.  I rotate it with the classic "":08 Minute"" workout series, which is my other favorite.",1195948800,2,1185,4.840796019900497
8138634,3,B000HD1MTI,I own quite a few exercise videos and I must admit that this one is my least favorite. Tanna doesn't take the time to explain posture and position before she immediately jumps into an exercise.,1190332800,6,193,4.542857142857143
8138635,3,B000HD1MTI,"This really should be labeled as a total body workout.  There are 4 10-minute sections: stretch, lower body, upper body, and abs.  I was expecting to get a variety of 10-minute ab workouts.

The stretch section is probably the best part of this DVD.  The other sections are pretty basic.  The abs section is a true disappointment--it's mostly crunches with a few minor variations.  It wasn't very challenging, either, even for a beginner/intermediate like me.

The instructor is pleasant and the cuing is good.  The set and production values are sparse--it looks like someone set up a camcorder in a warehouse.  This isn't the worst workout ever, but it's far from the best.",1183334400,10,674,4.893805309734513
8138636,5,B000HD1MTI,"I absolutely love this video.  I use it in the morning and in the evening.  This is definitely a video for those of us who are pressed for time or can't really get up early enough in the morning to exercise for half an hour.  The who video is broken down in to categories like stretching, upper body, lower body and abs and the section is limited to ten minute increments.  It is very effective and very doable for everyone!",1178409600,5,424,4.2625
8138637,5,B000HD1MTI,"Now, I don't know too much about fitness instruction, either on a video or elsewhere, so this review just comes from someone who desperately wants to pull her tummy back in. Tanna looks the very picture of health, so I'm going to take her word for it. And let me say at the outset that it's a tremendous relief nto to have someone going whoooo---wheeee--good job all through. I hate that! Just get on with it! And that's what Tanna Valentine does.

I've just acquired a bunch of fitness videos (some bellydance-flavoured and some not) and I found myself picking this one to begin with. The word ""abs"" always gets me, but apart from that I found it was one of the more doable ones. The learning of the actual moves isn't so difficult, thank God. The video, under the eye of fitness guru Andy Troy, has four segments, each of 10 minutes. I have no idea whether 10 minutes a day would actually get you fit and trim in the tummy, but I rather doubt that one can do that math because it depends on what else you're doing--and eating. Good sense says there can be no magic. Anyone would have to work at it and do so in more than one way. Eat junk half the day, sit splat on your bottom the rest of the day, and it's a sure shot you won't lose much weight, workout or no workout.

The first segment is a set of lovely stretches that, I have to say, feel very very good. In fact, I'd love to know whether there's any benefit to stretching the stretch segment for a whole lot longer. Tanna's instruction is clear, very straightforward, and goes at a very comfortable and nice pace. Another thing I hage is videos that go frantically from one move to the next, leaving you disoriented while you figure out what just happened here. The second segment is a lower body workout. This has bridging, leg lifts, squats, and similar moves. This one works you harder than the stretches, of course. Then there's an upper body workout which I'm afraid I'm going to skip because it uses weights, which I haven't yet acquired. I bellydance so I'm counting on a lot that happens there to keep my upper body fit. The last segment is the abs segment and that's the toughest. I'm easing into that segment slowly and like it very much.

That's it! 40 minutes--10 for each workout. I love the wholesome and clean feel of this whole video and plan to stick with it for a long while. Whether the workouts work for me or not - I will report after a few months. Meanwhile, I do like it enough to have presented it to an abs-obsessed friend as well.

Oh--a note on how I'm working with this video. I first watch a segment a couple of times and make sure I note the specifics of each move. Including the safety tips. I then make sure I know the sequence. And then I do-along. I started by covering the stretches segment fully, but stopped for the day and added parts of the next segment the next day, easing into it rather than trying the whole lot at one go.",1165795200,20,2924,4.320582877959927
