1200594,5,B00000F0JU,"This workout is great, the dancers are very talented, love dancing & very fluid & really show you hot to get into the beat/music. That alone is better then most dance workouts by people who have no rhythm, *cough* Kathy Smith *cough*. When you learn to dance from people who can't feel a rhythm & are very stiff with bad posture/form, your form looks bad as well.

I never was into reggae music before, but I loved dancing to these songs & was really able to feel the beat/rhythm for the second time in my life. Zumba latin dancing DVDs, which Amazon doesn't carry, is the other.
It's set on a beach with Vanessa two other women & one very buff guy (the people you see on the cover) who you can tell have many years of dance experience between them. The music is always playing that really gets you going.
The warmup includes nice upward stretches, back openings & the usual calf & hampstring stretches & butterly.
There are three routines, the 2nd one taught by the guy. They teach by going 1/2 speed (not 1/4 like other DVDs that let you get bored)& breakdown the steps one-by-one & slowly put it together while the music is always playing to keep you inspired.
In between learning new steps, I love they don't stop, they have you do an easy dance step as an ""ISLAND BREAK!"" often to keep you going w/o killing you. Because, trust me, you will get hot with the whole 40+ min workout. If you're in great shape, you can use the time to do the harder steps to the music to increase your heartrate.
The cooldown is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, it should be done on a stage. It's done poolside & the music is very slow & sensual. There isn't any cuing, but they move so slow, if you watch it 1-2x you'll have it down pat easy. When you do it, you feel so graceful & the moves are perfect to stretch out the exact muscles that need it & feel so good.
The only negative is in between each segment (about 5), Miss Jamaica talks from another location for about 30 seconds to 1 min, but I use that time to grab water or FF the DVD.

1200595,5,B00000F0JU,"So what if the butterfly is no longer popular? We can bring it back!!
This is a video for people who like to shake it in their living rooms and get their s'wet on. The music is great and cheerful and so are the instructors. The moves are fun and easy and groovy all around. My favorite move is definitely the ""fly away.""
I will keep on doing the butterfly forever, even 20 years after it was popular. Because it's the greatest. S'wet forever!",1055203200,10,442,4.273809523809524
1200596,4,B00000F0JU,"I really enjoy this workout.  When I am not very motivated, I like to choose a workout that is more dance oriented, since I get a great work out without feeling like I am ""working out"".  I enjoy this one for several reasons, the instructor cues the moves well and shows proper form, it has great island music and beach locales and most of all it is just fun. I don't think you need to be an expert dancer, but if you like to dance it sure helps.  It may take a few tries to get down the moves, but once you do, it is a fun work out that leaves you feeling great. Enjoy this workout for what it is, it is a nice, get your behind off the couch and moving kind of routine, it is not a heart pumping, muscle aching kind of work out.  Just enjoy the flow of it and like the instructor says, ""find your own flavor"".",1043539200,,809,3.9447852760736195
1200597,2,B00000F0JU,"This workout is fun to watch but it is very hard to follow, especially if you are used to doing your workout to other videos. There is no lead-in to the change in moves; apparently, you are supposed to memorize the routine! I tried to follow but she moved too fast from move to move without any warning or explanation. Maybe it would be easy for people who are good dancers, but I'm a fitness beginner...and this one was just too hard to follow.  The music is great, though!",1013212800,2,474,4.325842696629214
1200598,3,B00000F0JU,"I recently bought this tape, but I was a bit disappointed. It was a little cheesy visually speaking. They could've done without the intro by Pageant Queen, it made them seem like they're trying too hard. It was good to see Patra in the first 1/2 hr. On a good note, the moves were fun.",996537600,4,285,4.2
1200599,5,B00000F0JU,"I collect interesting exercise video tapes.  Having a variety of tapes to use keeps your motivation to exercise strong.  This one was wonderful!  The Jamaican backdrop is really beautiful, especially when it's snowing outside.  The dance routine is great and I look forward to ""getting it"".  It gives me something to shoot for.  You do have to keep moving during Ms. Jamaica's comments but it adds to the flavor of the video.  And once you learn the routine you can put more effort and ummphh! into your moves to speed up your heart rate.  Unfortunately I didn't purchase the tape from this site and the price here is so much better!  What do you have to lose???",981504000,3,662,4.589743589743589
1200600,4,B00000F0JU,"This tape has a lot going for it.  It's a big departure from much of the market, which often consists of sterile workout tapes with cookie-cutter models and bland music.  You won't find that on this tape.  As others have pointed out, this is essentially a dance tape.  You'll learn some funky moves and boogie to pop/reggae tunes.  You'll also see some lovely beach shots.  The music is fun, the moves are fun, although a tad difficult to figure out at first.  I found I enjoyed the tape most when I stopped worrying about whether I was ""getting it right.""
It's very laid back (very Jamaican, in fact) in its approach; there are even multiple short segments where you get to just boogie to the music and do your own thing.  Whether you enjoy that approach or not will probably tell you whether you'd want to own this tape.
On the negative side, there are moves that probably aren't good for you to do unless you're supple and fit.  For example, my knees aren't in great shape and I'm overweight.  There are a few moves I have to modify in order to protect my knees.  Also, these folks are dancing on sand, which behaves differently from carpet.  One series of steps involves twisting on the balls and heels of your feet, something that's very difficult to do wearing tennis shoes on carpet.
Summary: whether you'll enjoy this tape depends on what you're looking for.  If you like a heavy-duty workout with carefully specified instructions, this probably isn't the video for you.  If you want to casually dance to fun music and learn some funky moves in the process, you'll probably enjoy it.",978652800,30,1591,4.595744680851064
1200601,1,B00000F0JU,"I tend to love Michele Lemay and her choreogrpahy. The choreography itself in this video is fun. I really would not call this a work out video at all. It is a dance video and you will learn the Gumby and some other dance club moves. If you just want to dance to reggae music, buy it - I would recommend it for this. But if you are looking for a real aerobic workout, get another one of Michele Lemay's tapes. I agree that the comments by Miss Jamaica are awkward and you can really do without them. All in all, this is a short, low impact, low energy dance video.",978480000,6,563,4.081081081081081

7906399,1,B00000F0JU,What a disappointment this DVD was :( I wish I could return it. I did not learn any dance moves. I love reggae and dancehall music but the music on the DVD was not great and it was a bunch of people girating with little instruction.,1192233600,2,232,4.065217391304348

7906401,5,B00000F0JU,"I first ordered this workout from a BET advertisement because I am a reggae fan. I love the warm-up & the dances in the different sections; my favorite move is the fly away.  Michelle is so ""perky"" that you can do this workout at 5am & still start smiling because of her cheerfulness; there's even a part where she forgot what step she was supposed to be doing & she just played it off, smiled, & kept it movin'!  I love the cooldown...everything about this workout just worked for me. I still have the bonus cd with the music.  I'm surprised that I still have that copy because I've just about wore that baby out!",1130198400,13,614,4.321739130434783
7906402,5,B00000F0JU,"I really enjoy this DVD because it's fun and simple, but very effective.  A lot of times the dance videos seem to operate under the assumption that the dances have to have you spinning in circles in order to work.  Wrong.  What I love about this DVD is that the routines are really easy, but keep your heart rate up.  It really does make you sweat!",1116201600,6,348,4.2272727272727275
