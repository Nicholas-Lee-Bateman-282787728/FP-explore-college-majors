I was very much torn when I read what it was to be about but I kept passing it in Netflix and decided to just find out. It's, to me, an amazing movie about love. In this case love in every aspect. Love of your spouse, love of friendship, love of living and love of yourself. Now had I found my husband cheating he wouldn't be walking and neither would his lover, but this gave you a view from all three characters. From the husband you see his struggle between loving two women, the heart wants what it wants. He does love his wife and he had thought about ending the affair but couldn't seem to walk away. As the movie goes on he starts to see the differences between himself and his mistress and yet those differences also make them great together. From the mistress a love for a man she knows deep down she'll never truly receive back. As she comes to a friendship with a stranger she finds herself wondering if this is where her life will forever be. The third to a partnership and what to do about it. I dislike women and men who don't care about whether someone is with someone or not and I don't feel bad if they get hurt, emotionally, from the outcome. But this movie really does bring about what happens when you know it's wrong but you can't stop from feeling the way you do. From the wife you see her struggle with the actions of the one she loves and the actions she had placed into motion. The wife finds out who the mistress is and goes about a plan to destroy her life, my kind of woman, but along the way realizes she's a good person, if an idiot, and struggles with herself. The mistress is now a friend and still her enemy. The one question in the end that had me thinking is: Is it better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all? That's where I loved the movie for while I hate cheating and those who do it, it brings upon my one way view into seeing something more there. I'll never agree with cheating and I hope to never find myself in this predicament but I have no idea what will happen. Again loved this movie and completely urge you to give it a shot. I hope you like it as I have because it was amazing. The first part of the movie does remind me of soft core porn but get past that and it's well worth watching over again. I just wish it would come out for region 1 so I can own it. I hope this helps.",1351123200,,2489,4.0920245398773005

The premise is interesting: the wife befriends the mistress but the mistress is unaware that her friend is really her lover's wife. As a musician, I loved the score. It featured mostly piano and it created a very empty feeling which I think portrays a lot of the feelings in the film. The only thing I didn't like was the sex and nudity. I don't think it was necessary. It was a little too graphic for me but I can understand that for some people they would like that; however, I did not. Overall, this is a great film about love, the absence of love, and different shades of love; I'm happy I purchased it. If Ya Entertainment publishes this same movie for the American audience, I will re-purchase it.",1339632000,,859,4.308641975308642
