4572491,5,B00559SGCU,"I was ready to jump out of my seat with joy when i saw the previews for this. The movie more than lived up to my expectations.
 I've been a huge admirer of wild cats ever since i saw Born Free as a little girl. Lions, cheetahs, tigers, servals you name it. I've watched many video's and t.v. specials on them over the years but few compare to DisneyNature African cats.
 Showing both good times and bad this is an acurate depiction of these cats lives. Disney did an admirable job of making it as family friendly as possible. Yes, some scenes may upset very young viewers. If you're worried about a 'Bambi' moment you may want to preview it first.
However i strongly recommend you get this film and save it for when they are ready.
 It's a beautiful, honest movie about some of this world's most majestic and inspiring beings. African Cats and other DisneyNature films are 'living' memories of our world. A world in which sadly lions and cheetahs may soon be a thing of our past.
 I eagerly look forward to getting the dvd of this. It's only available in a dvd/blue ray combo but as long as there's a disc i can use with my dvd player, ok.",1311033600,42,1139,4.333333333333333
4572492,4,B00559SGCU,"For me, this movie was great.  As a younger kid (maybe 5), I would have thought this movie very sad.  However, this is the true life of the african cats in their day to day routines.  Yes, there is hunting and death but that is the true circle of life.  I am a big cat fanatic, so I knew most of the facts in the movie already, but I still found the movie enjoyable.  I believe any child around 10 or older would find it fascinating.",1310601600,4,433,3.988372093023256
4572493,5,B00559SGCU,"I saw this movie at the theater and LOVED IT.  I particularly loved the way they portrayed lions.  Too often are lions portrayed as the bad guys who are just out to kill the sweet little zebras and antelope.  This film actually makes you understand that just because lions kill for food doesn't mean they're bad--they have a family to feed.  At some parts, I was actually cheering for the lions to get food, because if they didn't, the cubs wouldn't survive.  This film also shows the affectionate and playful side to lions, while still showing their aggressive and predatory side.  I really wasn't expecting lions to be so family-oriented and sweet to each other.  Then again, I guess that's how the pride becomes strong.

I also like how it shows that big cats have their own problems too and that they aren't trouble-free bullies, like so many other animal programs make them out to be.  Of course, this movie has animal death, but then again, what do you expect?  It's a movie about LIONS and CHEETAHS--of course they are going to show how they get food! I have read too many reviews on other sites from people complaining about Disney showing how lions and cheetahs kill for food, and claiming that they ran out of the theater CRYING with their kids in tow.  Okay, idiots, if you want to see a movie about the lives of LIONS AND CHEETAHS, common sense tells you that you will see some blood.  If your common sense does not tell you that, then that's your own fault for being ignorant.  I mean seriously.  There was even death and violence in ""March of the Penguins""!  Even so, the killings in ""African Cats"" are not very graphic. Really, you just see a hunt, a strike, and maybe some blood on the cats' faces after they've eaten, but it's nowhere near as graphic as some drama queens make it out to be.

The scenery in the movie is beautiful.  Sometimes, it looked like the drawings from ""The Lion King"" were brought to life.  The ending credits were cute.  This was a good little documentary.  I would recommend it to anyone who are interested in learning more about some of the big cats in Africa.",1310428800,37,2104,4.515873015873016
4572494,5,B00559SGCU,"Disneynature has carved a niche for itself in theatrical releases of nature films with varying success. Earth and Oceans were moderately profitable, though they suffered from an episodic structure that did not hold an audience's attention, and terrible narration that distracted pointlessly. The strongest release yet is African Cats, co-directed by one of the architects of Planet Earth, Alastair Fothergill. Following a pride of lions and a mother cheetah, African Cats considers apex predators and their interplay on the productive Mara veldt. The  camerawork captures the vastness of the Masai Mara plains while not losing sight of the intimate details essential to understanding the bonds between mother and cub. It lacks the violence of The Last Lions, but none of its storytelling verve, and brings some needed energy to a fairly barren week for film.

African Cats follows events in the lives of Mara, a lion cub who is under the tutelage of her mother, Layla; Sita, a cheetah who is raising five hungry newborns; and Fang, a male lion who attempts to protect his family and territory from a rival lion. Survival on the bitter savanna is a perpetual struggle. Mara is only six months old, and as a lion cub has a 1 in 5 chance of surviving to adulthood. Life seems simple for a cub, awaiting kills and playing with siblings while learning gradually how to fend for themselves; Mara's days are numbered, however, as the mother is nursing an injury that is slowing her down. Sita must regularly leave her cubs to hunt for food, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Even if she makes a kill, cheetahs are regularly chased from it by hyenas or lions. Cheetahs are built for grace and speed, not for standing fights. They must lead a nomadic existence as they cannot defend a territory, and overland journeys in Africa are hazardous. Fang leads the River Pride, and as the king, he is surrounded by pretenders to the throne. His tooth is broken, and his strength is waning, but the spirit is always willing for a lion male. As filmed on the Masai Mara, the beauty and brutality of the wild is captured with scrupulous detail. Nothing is guaranteed, and none of these are characters protected by a screenplay. What is, is what must be.

The drama is thick and the stakes are absolute for these cats, as they are surrounded by enemies, and stalked always by hunger. The River Pride is being shadowed by Kali, who brings a lethal phalanx in his four sons. All that stand between them and conquest of the River Pride is Fang - and if they succeed, Mara will be the first to die as male lions kill the cubs of rivals. Sita has five cubs, and they are nearly blind and helpless. To hunt for food is dangerous, and she is always in danger of losing them. One harrowing scene depicts Sita being pursued by lions; she must distract them, but then loses her cubs in the darkness. And the shadows are ruled by hyenas. The chase scenes are thrilling, and remarkably photographed, capturing the sinew and muscle of the predator, the frantic escape of the prey, and the excitement is palpable as the gap is closed. Remarkable scenes where lions confront crocs and a cheetah actually attacks a lion (five times her size) are interspersed with shots that capture the impossible numbers of grazers seen on the Masai Mara. There are quiet moments, where a cub must choose to stay with the pride, or remain with her injured mother where they might die together. There are scenes of intensity, as the River Pride is attacked and a surprising defense is mounted. Time is taken out for some amusement - in the closing credits, aardvarks are tasked with `fight choreography', and hippos are credited with `underwater photography'.

As directed by Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, the emphasis is on crafting a narrative, in serving that uniquely human attribute that desires a sort of meaning or direction to a story. Events in the natural world rarely follow any sort of moral or even an identifiable pattern, but such randomness would seem nihilistic to us. The point of organizing stories in works like African Cats or any episode of BBC Earth (Planet Earth, Life of Mammals, etc) is to provide a reference point, something humans can relate to, since we labor under the misapprehension that life has an underlying meaning. The point is not to stick to raw facts, as ten hours of footage of lions yawning does not make for engaging cinema. An intuitive link to our animal relatives is essential to understand our place in a system that is too complicated to understand fully. In this sense, the work of Fothergill approaches the real better than reality can in the eyes of the viewer. His partnership with David Attenborough has raised the bar of wildlife photography alongside the best that movies can offer, with sweeping vistas that do not lose sight of the intimate moments of nature.

Samuel L. Jackson brings energy to the narration that makes his presence less annoying than voice actors tend to be for nature films. I prefer the work of Iain Stewart or David Attenborough primarily because they write their own material and are speaking from a position of expertise. Actors have difficulty expressing biological or ecological terms with any authority, so they are saddled with dialogue that is either irritatingly vague or irrelevantly emotional. Jackson seems to have fun with it, and the tone is aimed at children anyway. Compared to the coke-fueled hyperkinetics of most animated films, African Cats is perfect. The unifying theme is the bond between mother and cub, and the extraordinary sacrifices required to bring that cub to adulthood. Layla will fight to the death for Mara, and her near-suicidal courage is all that will protect her from marauding male lions. Sita must bring her great skill in hunting prey and evading hazards to bring her brood to maturity. The result is moving, the story is at times thrilling and at others tragic, and the film is pure entertainment.",1308182400,34,5976,4.83203125
4572495,5,B00559SGCU,I saw this picture in theaters. I loved it! I wonder if the 3 coalition cheetahs were Honeys cubs. If so then it is nice to know they prospered after their mom was murdered.,1306022400,5,173,4.117647058823529
4572496,2,B00559SGCU,"We walked out of this movie at the 3/4 mark because it was just the same old thing the entire movie. Cute cubs get eaten by hyenas. Old noble lioness can't keep up with pride & she & cub are left to die. Old lioness abandons cub & dies alone. Cheetah mom has to fight male lions. Male lions gang up on cute cheetah cubs. Male lions gang up on old male & drive him to his lonely death. Cheetah kills adorable gazelle. Crocs threaten lions. Just on and on. The fabricated script is laser focused on death, dying, injury, pain, suffering, and fighting.

Remember when Bambi's mother got killed? Well in this movie it's more like mother, father, aunt, Thumper, & a few assorted birds & rodents all get killed.

The writers concocted a simplistic dramatic story that's focused on death & struggle, & the movie strictly follows that, ignoring other aspects of feline life that might have been explored. You don't get much insight into cat behavior other than fighting, hunting, & dying. In spite of the ""Cats"" in the title, there are not many cats in the movie. 1 cheetah, 5 cheetah cubs, 5 male lions, 4 female lions, & 10 or so lion cubs, & that's it. No puma, jaguar, lynx, tiger, cougar, mountain lion, or any other cat.

Great photography of cats, animals, landscape, & weather, but u can't enjoy it. How can you enjoy great photography of an African thunderstorm when they carefully point out t you the cold, wet, shivering cheetah & cubs?

It's not really a documentary. There isn't much educational content. It's more a creative effort of storytelling. They needed to balance it. Maybe 70% cute cubs playing & exploring cat behavior & thought with only 30% harsh reality. Instead it's 90% depressing.",1305849600,13,1702,4.625827814569536

I wasn't sure if I would like this movie because I hate to see animals hunting. This movie was done so well though and the hunting scenes were shot in a way where you could see the power of the hunter without having to watch their prey suffer. It would cut out right at the perfect time. Our son loved this movie so much that he had to go buy a cheetah, lion, and lioness and plays with them constantly (the schleich animal toys). The narration is great and I actually cried during one scene. I highly recommend this movie!!!!",1304121600,7,654,4.24
4572498,4,B00559SGCU,"This documentary follows two mother cats, a lion and a cheetah, as they try to protect their cubs on the African savanna.

Adults who have even a minimal layman's knowledge of these magnificent animals will probably not get much new information, but they will be treated to incredible visuals that will unfortunately lose much of their power on most home screens.  Filmmakers Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey have really captured some extraordinary images.  Children are likely to be captivated.  My own four-year-old son was challenged a bit by the 90 minute running time, but was frequently drawn in by what was on the screen and finally declared it to be ""so much fun.""  The narration features the anthropomorphism and sentimentality that plague so many Disney nature films (i.e., ""To Mara, Fang is the best daddy ever""), but the essential quality of the filmmakers' work shines through.",1303516800,10,895,5.102739726027397

4572513,3,B00559SGCU,"African Cats
 The Disney folks produced this nature documentary through its Disneynature arm.  It exhibits all of the expected virtues of a big budget Disney nature film.  It of course also has the flaws of the Disney mode of making kid friendly nature films.
 The virtues of this expansively photographed G rated eye pleaser heavily outweigh the flaws.  We are permitted to join a family of cheetahs, mom and five kittens, shortly after the babies are born.  We follow the lives of the mother and her young through childhood and adolescence until the babies are all grown up cheetahs in their own right.  Few things in nature are cuter or more smile inducing than five baby cheetahs at play.
 Although some would say that baby lions are even cuter and more smile inducing.  We also follow a pride of lions through a season on the great plains of Kenyas gigantic Masai Nature Reserve.  The landscape of Africa and the sheer size of the place give it a unique sort of beauty which the cinematographers use and display to our great visual benefit.  Besides the cheetah and lion babies we briefly see most of the other significant animals of the region including elephants, hippos, jackals -the to my mind horrid- hyenas, lovely gazelles, fierce cape buffalo and an even million wildebeest on their migratory journey.  We see decidedly odd birds of several species, giraffes and rhinos.  All this is photographed in astonishing detail, clarity and we cannot help but be thrilled by the sights.
 This is a fine film to view with very young people.  Disney makes up little stories about the wild animals that the wee folk can assimilate.  This helps make the moving pictures more accessible to children.  They wisely kept the film short at one hour and a half.  Even the grandeur of Africa cannot keep little squirmers in their seats forever.  If you have a child that you want to introduce to Africa in air conditioned comfort, by all means see this film.  If you can discover how they got the shots of the just barely eye opened cheetahs, please let me know.
 On the other hand, if you have achieved your majority, you might give this one a pass.  All the rough edges of nature are, quite understandably, smoothed away.  We rarely glimpse the fragile gazelle actually in the process of dismemberment.  When the horrid hyenas kill two of the very young cheetah kittens, it is well out of sight.  The stories about the families fail to disclose very much about how lions actually operate in their natural context.  The Hobesian brutality of nature in the raw is glossed over.  The producers almost entirely omit any scientific understanding of the lives of wild animals.
 Still, we shouldnt quibble.  This two saw blade documentary is for children and not for adults.  Lets leave it at that.  The very busy Samuel L. Jackson provides the authoritative voice over.",1469836800,,2858,4.771428571428571

Simon King, who is one of the main guys who presents Big Cat Diary, was involved so it came as no surprise that it captured the Masai Mara so well!  I wish they would have used Simon instead of Samuel L Jackson to narrate, simply because I much prefer Simon's delivery from Big Cat Diary.  Nevertheless, Jackson did a great job at narrating and made for a surprisingly engaging narrator.  I liked the inflections he chose to use and you could definitely feel the drama of the situation show through his voice.

The only reason I prefer Simon is simply because when he talks you can actually hear the fear/dismay in his voice when something bad could potentially happen.  I would have loved to see this presented Big Cat Diary style with Simon King and Johnathan Scott presenting.

I thought this would be along the same lines as the Oceans movie, so I thought it would be a great movie to watch New Years Eve with my cat. The Oceans movie was very soothing, and while there was some drama, mostly uplifting. This movie is not so uplifting.

In general the film follows different cat families (i.e. - mothers and cubs as well as a pride) and how they fare. This is a documentary and they follow these families. Yes, there are many lovely scenes where moms are teaching cubs to hunt and cubs are playing, lions roaring at each other, etc. But -- SPOILER ALERT --

Some of the cubs die. A mother dies. And the entire time you're watching it you KNOW there are wildlife people on the filming crew or near the filming crew and a vet could be called to save at least one of those deaths, but no. We just watch them die. We watch the hyenas hunt the cubs. On the screen. For real. No happy ending.

NOT for family viewing.",1438646400,,1033,4.124378109452737

The movie does deal with topics of death and survival in a harsh environment. It handles these very tastefully and appropriately. It isn't something that one should feel the need to shelter younger viewers from. If that is your inclination, however, know that it is in the movie.

Understand that there is a narrative story being told, and that the story , although consistent with the footage, may come across as anthropomorphized to some extent. It makes the footage more accessible to a younger audience, but some may object to it.",1413936000,,660,4.990909090909091

This movie will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat, if you like that sort of thing. It is just too dramatic and SAD! I realize that nature is cruel and indifferent but I am not, nor do I particularly like watching mother nature's cruelty non-stop for an hour and a half. It is, however, a beautifully filmed movie, hence the three stars. Bottom line- if your kids (or you!) can take the harsh reality of life in the wild (read: many main characters, along with several minor ones, die or disappear) then you will probably love this movie. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions like ""What happened to the babies?"" and ""Did her mother die?"" and ""Why is she lonely?"" Followed, of course, by the requisite tears (usually mine) when the answer is given. I, for one, never want to see this movie again. Call me soft if you must but, I'm considering having this movie ""disappear""!

4572688,5,B00559SGCU,"This has to be the best lion film. It is the true story of a lion pride and a cheetah family. I will start out with the cheetahs. Sita, is a single cheetah mother of five cubs. She risks everything to save her cubs, including leading a angry Kali away from her cubs and fighting off hungry hyenas. Now for the lion side of the story. Layla is a aging lion mother of one cub, Marah. Layla is determent to hunt and care for Marah, but she is getting to old. Once she tries to go hunting for zebra with the other lionesses and is injured when a zebra kicks her. She is left limping in her front right leg. But she is still determent to keep Marah safe. In a bad turn of events the herds are moving on to greener grass and the pride must follow, but Layla is left behind, leaving young Marah to fend for herself. That is just the beginning of this beautiful story. Now, I have seen some coments say that the narration is bad. I think that it is actually quite flowing. He tells the story with a easy way for kids to understand, but it is not babyish. This tale is also free of violence, mostly. To some younger children there maybe a couple of scenes that are a small bit frightening. Of course the lions and cheetahs hunt, chasing after there prey and pulling them to the ground with sharp claws and biting them. But it is free of gory images. Also, when the cubs get accidentally separated from Sita, it turns dark and Sita can not go search for them. But she calls all night. By the time morning comes, only three out of five cubs come back. It says that the two cubs who did not come home were ""taken"" by the hyenas. Young ones will pass it over without knowing the meaning of ""taken"". Layla dies of old age, but it will also be passed over by most younger viewers. Last of all lions fight briefly, and Sita has a tussle with some hyenas  but it is hardly what you would call ""nightmare giving"". Over all it is a wonderful, majestic family film. Great movie night or rainy day movie. Oh, and there is no hint of evolution. It is just a great way to enjoy God's marvelous creation. I hope my review helped you decide to watch this movie. : )",1376006400,2,2140,4.169082125603865
4572689,2,B00559SGCU,"I loved Chimpanzee with it's following a single family of chimps and its fairly mature, mildly (pleasantly) humorous narration by Tim Allen. This film took the storytelling way too far. It feels very forced. Imagine beautiful cinematography ruined by horrible voiceover by Mace Windu from the Star Wars prequels. The script was awful, but Samuel L Jackson made it even worse by channeling his Star Wars character and making each line painfully over-dramatic. It's apparent that this script was written for 7-year-olds. Very repetitive, very simplistic, trying to create an epic where there is none. Good family films are kid-friendly without driving the parents crazy.",1375574400,,668,5.371428571428571

4572711,5,B00559SGCU,"African Cats, a documentary from Disneynature, takes viewers into the lives of two lion prides and a cheetah family. The first lion pride, with its leader, Fang, is comprised of several lionesses and lion cubs. The second, led by Kali, includes Kali's four sons. A duel ensues. There can only be one winner. Who will rule over the both lion prides? Enter into the picture Mara and her mother, an aging lioness. Will she be able to protect her daughter? And when she is injured, will the pride have mercy on her and wait while she heals, or will they forge ahead in search of much-needed food?

Viewers are also introduced to Sita, a single mother cheetah and her children. Can she protect them from hyenas and other dangers until they are full grown and able to survive on their own?

Enter the animal world, filmed on location in Kenya.

While there is no excessive violence, this is a film about nature, and it is realistic. Young ones will be frightened by a few scenes and the death of a parent might frighten smaller children.

After you've finished watching African Cats, don't turn off the power button. The credits, where still shots of the ""actors"" (animals) are shown, is well worth the watch. It includes humorous titles for each of the animals in the film and is sure to draw a laugh.

Full of beautiful scenery, edge-of-seat-scenes, action, drama, and educational, African Cats is a winner and well-worth the watch. Highly recommended for those ages 8 and older.

The movie is a welcome change from the endless fantasies and immoralities portrayed by Hollywood and devoured by the public. It's a captivating story of lions and cheetahs in Africa, the endless cycle of life, and a mother's love (a mother cat, that is).

It has parts that are too intense for children, and we found it to be a bit long, so watch it with grown ups when you have plenty of time to not feel rushed.

4572770,4,B00559SGCU,"I love nature videos, and DisneyNature produces some of the best I've ever seen.

The DisneyNature series has been improving each year since it's debut. At first the movies were visually stunning, but lacked an intriguing plot with beginning, middle, and end. By the time African Cats came out they have refined their films to something the whole family can enjoy and really get lost in.

Unfortunately the Amazon Instant Video version does NOT do this movie justice. If you are expecting HD quality, what you'll get is worse than DVD. In some scenes particularly with a LOT of moving things (i.e. a huge flock of water buffalo) the compression Amazon adds to their video becomes unacceptably blocky.

If you want to see this movie in it's full glory, (the glory it deserves) purchase the blu-ray edition, rent the HD version here (if available) - OR - wait for amazon to sell a true HD experience.

** The movie itself deserves 5 stars absolutely. The missing star is for the drastic visual distortions from Amazon's video compression.",1338854400,,1036,4.836158192090395
4572771,4,B00559SGCU,"I enjoy these Disney Nature movies, because they are in essence, documentaries, but Disney goes in and puts a narration to the story to make it something more. They are filmed out in the wild over an extended period of time and document actual events, but Disney embellishes the facts a bit with a story written to entertain. Sadly, their narrator doesn't appeal to me.

Very well filmed and put together. My only gripe that loses a star is the Samuel L Jackson narration. I don't know why he is so popular. I can't stand him!! There were points early on where I just wanted to mute the movie and watch in silence, but I suffered through.

I suppose Jackson is good at what he does, but he is no James Earl Jones. That is to say, Jackson can't fit into just any setting for narration. The ""parents's"" book ""Go the F to Sleep"" on the other hand-- was the perfect narration project for Jackson.",1337990400,,892,4.4
4572772,3,B00559SGCU,"As I watched this movie African Cats, I realized that African Leopards are completely non-existent in this film. Leopards are African cats too, so why are they totally omitted, in an African Cats film? This film does not include all African cats, so this film only represents a selfish focus, on one Cheetah family, and one pride of lions. They only briefly focused on a Serval Cat that was being harassed by the main Cheetah family they remained focused on.

These film makers did not bother to include the Leopard as an African Cat, so that means this film is inaccurate. The Leopard is more numerous in Africa, and Asia, than the Lion and Cheetah combined. I'm trying to understand how Disney-Nature could film an African Cats movie, and then produce a documentary that completely omits Leopards as if extinct, no longer in existence, having died off in Africa.

But every time two major movie studio's get involved in producing a nature documentary for the big screen, they always alter the natural scheme of things, and arrange for something entirely unlikely to take place in the wild. One of the featured male Lions is named Kali, a supposed father Lion who bands together with his four grown sons. This idea goes completely against all the other previous lion documentaries that we have come to know.

All male lions in a pride, will father all juvenile lions in that pride. They will chase out and evict, all adolescent male lions in the pride before they fully become adults. The reason they do this is because these young male lions, are viewed as future competition to the adult male lions still guarding the pride. They are viewed as a future threat because; the elder male lion does not want his younger sons staying around long enough to challenge him for dominance. Their Father's earliest expulsion of them, helps lessen the chance of his own expulsion by them, if they remained in the pride.

If a male lion is now coalescing with his four sons, this would mean he has never forced them to leave the pride, at an early age. Adolescent lions that are brothers will sometimes remain together while marauding, to form a strong coalition which gives them a better chance of taking over a pride. But never before in documented lion behavior, has a male lion reunited with four sons at some later date, to form a powerful coalition. Please understand the unlikelihood of this ever happening in the wild. If four lions ever crossed paths with their solitary father, they would immediately treat him as an unknown rival by trying to kill him.

A powerful lion and his sons dominating a pride is absolutely unheard of. I believe that Kali is their more battle scared brother with a darker mane, or either a more dominate non-related lion, who met the other four males with the lighter manes while in exile, and they formed a coalition. I absolutely do not believe Kali is a father lion, living with his four sons for emergency backup. He would never be with sons who never were forced into early exile. This inaccuracy has been contrived by Disney-Nature, for the sensationalism, for the less informed movie-goers. Disney-Nature, and National Geographic, have both trampled truthfulness and cinematic authenticity, in their most recent wildlife documentaries.",1333756800,3,3268,4.838998211091234

The film segues between the two families living on opposite sides of a great river, while facing common threats to their daily survival.

The only negative to this production, in my opinion, is the narrative provided by actor Samuel L. Jackson. His reading, though serviceable, lacks the gravitas of a David Attenborough, Jeremy Irons, or Alec Baldwin.  Some segments may be a bit too intense for very young children.

(1) The visual effects of the blue-ray disc for this movie are stunning. The camera gets so close, and the details from the main cast themselves to the stunning African landscape are breathtaking!!!! I was in awe.

(2) Samuel L Jackson was a fabulous narrator! Yes there were some cheesy lines, but remember this is a Disney movie!

(3) The story itself was quite moving. I am 30+ male but I found my eyes getting wet at key scenes.

(4) If you are considering watching this movie with the kiddies - then do so! Yes there are death scenes but none of these are the least bit graphic.

(5) Very well made movie! The bonus features were excellent. I watched them all. I have never done that with any other dvd/blue-ray disc that I own.

I'm all for documentaries on movies. I especially love Africa and lions are my favorite big cat. This movie is utterly painful to watch. The so called violence doesn't bother me, after all thats nature. The parts of the movie that bothered me was the terrible narration, giving what was ""emotion"" to animals. Yes animals feel emotions and such but saying things like ""To Mara, he's the best dad ever!"" is stupid. Along with beating the viewers over and over again on how much a mother loves her cubs also adds to the annoyance. If it was just a strait up documentary then it would be fine. If you want to watch something that isn't covered all over with anthropomorphism watch Big Cat Diary. It's way better, gives you the strait facts, tells you what is behind all of the behaviors of the animals and has ALL of the big African cats. It also doesn't treat you like a very unintelligent child with it's narration.

Over all if you get sad easily over animals dying, don't watch this. Animals die in here, animals that are intended to be food for the main ""characters"" and 4 main characters die, 2 cubs, a lioness, and a lion (not technically but can be implied) If you can't take death or don't want your little one to see anything die then don't watch.

In a way I lucked out getting this for Xmas since that way I didn't have had to spend $26.00 on this. Hope this helps some people out. If anything if you really want to see this movie try watching it on netflix or borrowing it from a friend, otherwise I wouldn't waste my money on it.",1324944000,28,1581,4.463667820069205

4572789,3,B00559SGCU,"I realize life on the African plains is hard but it amazed me to see it portrayed this way in a Disney flick.  Most automatically assume Disney = safe for kids like the True-Life Adventures Roy Disney used to create. On the contrary, this movie spent a minute or two showing lion and cheetah cubs playing or just being bored followed by a good fifteen minute segment of them being utterly terrorized.  Rinse and repeat for an hour and a half.

I love Samuel L Jackson but the narration was just horrible in this movie.  Like the previous reviewer, I found the constant reminders of the ""love between a mother and their young cub"" were grating on the nerves; plus it's hard to control laughter when it's Samuel L Jackson saying it.

The similarities between this and ""Big Cat Diary"" are evident as they were both filmed in the Maasai Mara.  I believe I even saw Simon King and Jonathan Scott in the credits.  Unlike ""Big Cat Diary"", this film seemed to consist of a nonstop barrage of ""Bambi"" moments. African Cats may be a fearful experience for a young child.

4572790,2,B00559SGCU,"This has some of the most beautiful shots I ever witnessed in a documentary.  Migrating antelope, breathtaking landscapes, priceless cat behavior - in retrospect, this movie would be far better if without the narration.  Instead I was force-fed an uber-anthropomorphic plot that was unforgivably dumbed down.  Examples include stating that a baby cub ""thinks her dad is the best in the world"" and calling crocodiles ""dragons.""  I'm constantly reminded how much the mothers sacrifice, how much they love each other and so forth.  Love and sacrifice are by no means exclusive to humans, but throughout the movie I get the feeling that Disney is trying so hard to show me how similar lions and cheetahs are to us by assuming an omniscient role with respect to their thoughts. It would be far more powerful to just narrate their actions - only touching on thoughts or emotions when its most obvious. For instance, if cub that is playing with its mother, it might not actually be thinking ""I love you so much"" perhaps she is simply thinking ""this is fun!"" As far as the extent of anthropomorphism, it felt just a hair shy of ""Homeward Bound,"" which makes it one of the weakest documentaries I can remember. I realize this style is intended for children, however, March of the Penguins - a great movie for kids, does a far superior job in this respect.  Instead of taking on the impossible by attempting to tell me what the penguins are ""thinking,"" it focuses on their actions, allowing me the freedom to project. Children have an innate ability to learn.  Dumbing things down to the point of calling crocodiles ""dragons"" is a disservice to that, as well as to how interesting and beautiful the natural world is without the need for the supernatural or anthropomorphism.  If you want to see it for the beautiful filming, then make sure you have your iPod charged and ready. Sorry Sam Jackson, it's not your fault.",1322956800,13,1907,4.775075987841945

If it is not full HD or DTS-HD / TrueHD, I will not watch it. This title could have been made a lot cheaper if it weren't for those garbage pretending as ""freebies"".

I would have given this film 5 stars had it not been for Samuel L. Jackson's narration. Some of the time, he gets overly excited. At times, he sounds corny. Most of the time, he is telling a disturbing fairy tale story to three-year olds. Yes, children will appreciate the sights of animals but they just all stop there. For adults who love documentaries, like me, sights are just a minor part of what a great film should be made of. The complexity and poignancy of the lion behavior is what weave and dictate why they kill and overtake prides. It is a story told again and again but each time a new set of characters are sent into the fray, the cliched plot is never a bore.

Telling the story in an almost retarded way, just like what Samuel Jackson did, takes away the credibility of the content of what the behavior of the lion society is all about. I mean, if you continuously sugarcoat the gory sights, it just appears that you are simply lying. If you don't want to honestly describe it, then don't show it.

The wild is beautiful. But it is also the perfect representation of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Its beauty is only matched by its fierceness and savageness. And the sooner the kids get to know these facts, the better they could understand and respect nature.",1322611200,,1625,4.374172185430464

4572803,5,B00559SGCU,"I thought the footage in this movie was simply amazing. As a fan of big cats, I found this enthralling. To see such close-up footage of an entire lion pride, including cubs of all ages, and cheetah cubs from birth to maturity, was thrilling. The shots of both cats hunting, and the differences between them - the lionesses hunting as a pack, and the cheetah racing alone - was also stupendous. The shot of 4 male lions - a father and sons - together taking over a pride was also simply stunning. Throw in shots of other savannah animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, wildebeests, crocodiles, hippos, rhinos and more - and you really have the most amazing African footage ever shot.

However, the film spares no punches when it comes to the realities of predator life in the wild. Animals are felled in hunts, although the gore is kept to a minimum. Much sadder is the fate of many of the big cats themselves (spoiler alert) - 2 very young cheetah cubs are lost to hyenas, an elderly lioness dies leaving her young female cub to an uncertain fate, young male lions are driven from the pride by their new 'king', and more. My kids (ages 5 and 7) did watch most of this, but it required a lot of explanation on my part. They eventually gave up on it, leaving me watching it alone.

There are many sad moments in the film, but that could be said about many movies and it adds to the impact rather than being simply depressing...and that's from someone with a near-zero tolerance level when it comes to animals being hurt in any way (below zero when it's humans doing it.)

- With ""Oceans"" (2010), audiences helped establish 40,000 acres of marine protected areas in The Bahamas, which contain miles of vital coral reef.
- This year,  ""See `African Cats,' Save the Savanna"" continues Disneynature's conservation efforts in 2011.

Um, go ahead and guess how much of a difference they made?

Since he earliest days with the Disney Studios, he was closely involved with the True-Life Adventures series and other animal-related films (he even wrote the script for the Disneyland Records Storyteller vinyl album for Bambi).

Disneynature doesn't just pay lip service to the tradition of combining spectacular animal footage with gripping dramatic narrative, it delivers, thanks to partnerships with some of the best wildlife photographers and documentarists in the world. African Cats is a great example of this level of quality.

Narrated with a combination of familial warmth and grave intensity, Samuel L. Jackson guides us offscreen through the politics between lions and other wild cats, their triumphs and losses. So parents be prepared for some heavy stuff in parts, including real catfights (as opposed to the reality show variety).

There is also some humor, particularly in the end credits. While the genuine film credits appear on the right, at the left appear animals, one after the other, with amusing ""behind-the-scenes"" credits for fight choreography, etc.

The Blu-ray brings out the already-stunning photography as well. The extras are sparse, though, and I would have loved to see more of how the film was made, as was shown in other DVDs in the series.

This makes a good pairing with The Lion King, to compare and contrast from animated fiction to live action documentary. African Cats is about as close to the real thing as many of us will ever get.",1318636800,,1598,5.06083650190114

If your child is highly sensitive and you are not open about life issues (such as bacon is pig), then cut out the sound as it might not be as 'cute' as you thought. It is reality, educational and highly  entertaining.",1318550400,,722,4.077464788732394
4572837,4,B00559SGCU,"We really enjoyed this Disneynature film on the two African Cat Families: Lions and Cheetahs.

The first Disneynature film, Earth, was pretty good...We thought you can't beat James Earl Jones as a narrator, right?!

But when we watched Crimson Wing, we vowed never to watch another boring, poorly narrated animal documentary again.

Then African Cats comes along and proves me wrong.
There is a better narrator than James Earl Jones... his name is Samuel L. Jackson!!!  We decided to give Disneynature one more chance to redeem themselves... and it was fabulous!  Samuel L. Jackson's voice is smooth, keeps you interested, and does not distract from the beautiful creatures.

True to Disney style, this is a family friendly documentary, so you don't see the true gore/grit of wildlife, but you get the essence and the teaching opportunity for your kids.

The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because I would have liked a bit more educational information about the cats as well as the names of some of the other animals on the video (especially those interesting birds! What are they called?).",1317945600,2,1098,4.902702702702703

This is a beautifully filmed study of life in the Serengeti of Kenya.  Though it is a documentary about the lives of animals who live on two sides of a river that rises and recedes with seasons, the fact that it is so carefully creative and narrated by Samuel L. Jackson makes it seem like a written story.  It is successful on every level.

The film documents the lives of two prides of lions (the cats are given names to enhance the story)- one on either side of the unnamed river: on the north side is an old lioness and her young cub Mara who belong to a pride of lions protected by the snaggletoothed Fang.  On the south side is a proud lion father of four grown sons who wish to cross the river to gain new territory. The river is filled with dangerous crocodiles and makes their desire for conquering dangerous.  The story also focuses on Sita, a cheetah mother of five cubs whose relationship with her innocently adorable brood makes for another aspect of the tale: the cubs must learn to run, fight, and survive the threats of hyenas before Sita can leave them to return to her solitary life.  Though there are many light moments in the film the directors Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey are careful to include the reality of life in the wild.  The cycle of life is well demonstrated in the aging of  the older lions - the mother of Mara and Fang - and in the problems that face the cubs as they mature.

The film includes many of the fascinating birds, the wildebeests, the gazelles, giraffes, and the many other creatures who populate this eco-clime. At films end the overwhelming sense is one of tenderness in response to the family instincts of animals in the wild.  The degree of love and interaction between the cubs an their mothers is not only warmly inspiring, it also sends a message about good parenting to the humans watching the film!

4572839,5,B00559SGCU,"My son 5, daughter 9 and myself have just watched this film at the cinema and we all found it amazing.
My son has insisted that I print the pictures off the website and is taking them to school with the relevant plastic animals for ""show and tell"".  My daughter has requested that I buy 2 copies of the DVD so that when she leaves home she has her own copy to take with her !!!!

What I would love to see now is the making of this film.  How they managed to get all these shots is beyond me.  The image of Kali and his 4 sons striding along to take on Fang and steal his tribe must have been an animal videographers dream.

I thought the film was perfectly pitched towards children.  Nothing too graphic was shown.  When Kali took over the lion tribe it was explained to the viewer where the older cubs had gone but nothing was said about the younger cubs.  My 5 year old didn't notice but the 9 year old had some questions but is old enough to handle the answers.  I assume that they had been killed by Kali and his sons or had fled only to be killed by other hunters - please set me straight if I am wrong !)
Even when my sons beloved zebra was killed he accepted that as a way of feeding the lion cubs.

I definitely recomend this DVD and I may even do what my daughter asked and buy us all a copy - this is a firm family favourite already.",1316908800,,1343,3.9962546816479403

8457685,3,B00559SGCU,"The cinematography is outstanding, pity they had to ruin this pseudo-documentary with a forced tale that includes naming the cats as though they were characters in a drama.  Conjecture and supposition should never be part of a nature documentary.  It was obvious from the outset that they needed to invent a story where there wasn't one, just to suit a preconceived idea of what they wanted.  And then all credibility was sorely tested and hampered by a melodramatic narration filled with abrupt declarative sentences delivered with a great deal of pomposity.  All the while a wailing songstress let fly with notes, just notes, warbled in the background.
I would have been better served to turn the sound off.  In that case, this would have been a passable animal flick.

What I learned from this movie: nature may be pretty, but its definitely not nice.  Eat or be eaten.",1521331200,,872,4.851351351351352

8457690,5,B00559SGCU,"I had never purchased, or seen, a Disneynature production.  Honestly, the Disney name is what turned me off.  I thought it would be too sappy, unnatural, and couldn't compete with BBC Earth.  Even the cover picture on this disc turned me off.  It just doesn't look natural.... too manipulated.
HOWEVER, after watching the trailer, and getting a good price, I purchased it and watched it with my wife.  We, who are big fans of BBC Earth productions, were really pleasantly surprised.  The photography doesn't lack anything in comparison to BBC, and it does not seem overly contrived at all.  The part that actually beats BBC is that it is one long story narrowly focused on a few animals, so you really get to follow them and see a whole believable and natural story.  It does a great job of showing the magnificent beauty of the surroundings and the other animals, too.",1504742400,3,869,4.708609271523179
