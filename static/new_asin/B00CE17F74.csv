5717255,5,B00CE17F74,Most fun working out ever! Worked up more of a sweat than Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30. Way more fun!,1386806400,8,102,4.15
5717256,5,B00CE17F74,"If you are an admirer of burlesque and not sure which program to enter, this is certainly one of the best I have reviewed. This program is filmed in actual rich theater setting which enhances the beauty of this dance/workout. The two  beautiful girls who welcome you into your new venture are Peekaboo Pointe, and Gal Friday. They are beautiful, and full of energy so if you are up for a challenge, get ready for a phenomenal stretch and warm-up section. I love this section, rich with deep quad stretches, upper arm and shoulder rolls, side stretches, pigeon pose, down dog, hero pose, camel pose. I strongly recommend investing the time in preparing the body for the workout.  The actual workout requires stamina and really works the gluts and thighs. These prepare the body for the following sections.
Burlesque move sections
Each tutorial section includes three ten minute sections that begin with ease and increase in tempo.
Section one is quite delightful with sexy girlie burlesque moves on the floor.  Butt walk, fan kick, fake split, butt isolations (squeezing and releasing tension in the buttocks). These combinations are fun to watch but you will know then why the warm up section is a must. These are repeated several times with increase in tempo.
Section two begins with basic bounce, (a very sexy butt bounce), dribble, Pony dribble which resembles a running shimmy. This section is intense and incorporates standing and floor movements. These are challenging and take a little time to achieve but continuous practice will get you there! I love this section as well and reminds me of twerking...
Section three
This section incorporates upper and lower body movement. The movement in the hips is circular forming ""corkscrews"" or pelvic circles, with pelvic tilts. The arm rotations in combination with hip rotations create sexy,  slinky movement.
The bonus section includes a  very intense body sculpting section with various squats that firm the gluts and get rid of ""saddlebags"" in the hips.
This is an incredibly fun workout which is true to its word, ""WORKOUT""!  I have learned so many cute and sexy moves that I continued to repeat in attempt of perfecting each move.  Overall a very good, sexy,  and challenging workout.",1380844800,17,2240,4.986595174262734
8580736,5,B00CE17F74,"Soooo much fun and a great workout. Im in pretty bad shape, about 50lbs overweight and some of these moves (especially the floor moves, surprisingly) were difficult for me, but the fun dance moves are super easy. I love that its separated into sections. You can just learn the moves, you can do 10-minute workouts, or everything at once.

Gal and Peekaboo are characters. Their personalities really make this video fun and I laughed out loud at their little comments several times. If you hate working out but want to feel sexy and have fun while exercising, get this DVD.

Only issue is that a few times they would refer to things we had learned which were not actually shown. Like we did before with the ____ but we hadnt. This didn't affect how much I enjoyed it as a whole.",1517875200,,777,4.50354609929078
8580737,2,B00CE17F74,This is not a workout video. I don't think that that is what you're getting with this. It's almost like  B movie quality of workout videos.,1509753600,,139,4.346153846153846
8580738,2,B00CE17F74,"As much as I wanted to, I did not enjoy this video. The workout is too repetitive, has dull choreography, and doesn't feel like much of a workout.",1491955200,,146,4.25
8580739,4,B00CE17F74,Really enjoyed this video. Had a lot of fun trying to get the moves right.  Even laughed at myself.  Really easy to learn but you also have to have rhythm.  If you love Burlesque this is the one video to buy.  I wish I could purchase instead of renting.  Please make it available to buy.,1453507200,4,287,4.1454545454545455
8580740,5,B00CE17F74,What a hoot! Fun work-out.,1444089600,2,26,4.4
8580741,5,B00CE17F74,"Love this video. I feel I get a great stretch, sexy sweaty dance routines (3 total), and I am getting better at using muscles that making booty popping possible! Thank you!",1431043200,4,172,4.580645161290323
8580742,5,B00CE17F74,My daughter says this dvd is fun and has interesting exercises.  It has 3 -10 minute workouts on it plus a non-dance workout.,1423267200,3,125,4.434782608695652
8580743,4,B00CE17F74,i have both as the title says and i think they're both good dvds. some moves repeate but not many. and i do think they could have combined the two. but i don't feel cheated in getting both.,1410134400,3,189,4.0
8580744,5,B00CE17F74,"As I said on my review for ""Best Assets"" this one and that one are both great burlesque workouts, very fun and easy to follow! But they both have mostly the same moves, so buy one not both! I have both and feel as of I was cheated! But I do recommend either one.",1400716800,16,262,3.8703703703703702
8580745,4,B00CE17F74,"Super cute and fun to do.  I knew a lot of if not all of these moves before but this DVD puts a great spin on all of them.  The ladies really break it down so it becomes easy to understand and no pressure to be perfect.  The squat section was amaze.  There was a lot of chatter on the DVD and the workouts weren't teeeerribly difficult.  The repetitive motions and reps of the excersizes were the best part.  Wish it was a little harder with more Burlesque moves.  They also kept saying, like the move we talked about before, and they didn't teach it before...was it in a previous DVD?  No idea!  Only thing preventing this from getting 5 stars.  Otherwise I say it was a good investment!",1393372800,7,688,4.263565891472868
