8129536,1,B000G8NXRI,"I will rate this movie 5 stars, but the audio is Mandarin not Cantonese. This makes me angry.
Why don't you keep the original audio in Cantonese?",1464307200,,145,4.407407407407407

8129539,3,B000G8NXRI,"How can any one film combine martial arts, vampires, demon possession, East/West religious battles and debates about western underwear? Well, this one tries to! Don't let the three star rating undersell you -- it's a very fun, and a very funny movie. Battling vampires in a haunted church with neon crucifixes is always a good time! The fight scenes are outrageous, the demons are by turns pathetic and hilarious, and the WTF ending will have you asking, ""Sequel?"" Plus, the DVD comes with a free Exorcist Master t-shirt! Or, at least, mine did. Be the first on your block...this movie is sure to enliven any movie-night get-together with your friends. My buddies and I had a blast with it.",1235952000,6,690,4.80672268907563
