5969480,1,B00F878K0W,"Let's get this out of way: for the budget, the cast does some ok acting with what they are given and don't seem phony in the quasi-documentary style of the film.  Everything else here is obnoxious, meandering, and doesn't deliver in any dramatic way whatsoever.  Other than the 'horror' of drug use destroying lives (the film even manages to deliver this angle with apathetic blandness), there is nothing remotely frightening or suspenseful.  A disappointing affair that seems like someone found a couple of hours of themselves partying on their smartphone, wondered how they could use it for a movie, tacked on some vague voice over about the gates to hell in the last 15 minutes, and called it a horror film.  Obviously, if I watched it I'm willing to give indie movies a shot, but this was an awful 90 minutes.",1391990400,3,813,4.74468085106383
5969481,2,B00F878K0W,"I watched thirty-minutes of this film before realizing it was not, in fact, the backstage documentary on the Toadies (""Toadie Roadie"") that I'd meant to rent.  TWO STARS.",1391385600,,170,5.071428571428571
5969482,3,B00F878K0W,"Negatives:
1. Nothing really happens. Young adults get high; get drunk; do nothing; just exist at a level just below the poverty line.
2. It was suppose to have a Blair Witch element but nothing even close shows up. Just nothing.
3. Sadly, lead actress dies from a drug overdose shortly after filming in which she enacts a similar role.

Positives:
1. Surprisingly good acting for individuals with no acting and this was their only film, but then the film really didn't require acting to distant from one's self.
2. Accurate portrayal of those who use soft drugs to pass time and feel better about themselves, especially from a daily mundane existence.  And, for others a perspective/clarity to help expose and get perspective to a feeling of shallowness.",1390262400,3,755,4.890625
5969483,3,B00F878K0W,"I'd say it's worth experiencing, but it's not a ""horror"" movie per se, there's little direct story line ... but it's a fascinating view of characters in drug-fixated limbo.  Sadly, the beautiful actress/model Sara Anne Jones in TOAD ROAD died from a heroin overdose just after the film was released ... so how much of the movie is a tragic reflection of the actors' real lives, we're only left to guess.

Sara Anne Jones and her tragic death, her future life cut short ... will haunt you about this movie.  The movie itself was both less and far more than I expected.",1390003200,4,567,4.53921568627451
5969484,2,B00F878K0W,I bought this movie cause it sounded good. Well all that was good about it was the acting. There really is no horror to it. It was about kids getting high mostly. The main man actor and the lead lady one evening take a trip to Toad Road which is suppose to contain the 7 gates of hell. And well something happens. I just wish I watched this on Netflix. It sure wasn't worth what i spent on it. Do your self a favor and pass on this movie.,1389312000,4,438,3.932584269662921
5969485,2,B00F878K0W,"The acting in toad road was not bad, but the whole entire movie was about getting high. There is no real horror in store for anyone looking for a good scare. It left a lot to be desired.",1388361600,2,186,3.9210526315789473
5969486,5,B00F878K0W,"A dark and disturbing look at today's youth culture also in the format of a horror story. The unfortunate death of the young female lead adds validity to the movie's viewpoint. All the young non-professional actors turn in solid performances, but the star, James Davidson shows real talent as he spirals out of control. Not a movie to watch with your kids, unless you are making a statement about the dangers and despair of a drug-fueled life!",1388361600,5,443,4.766233766233766
5969487,4,B00F878K0W,"TOAD ROAD is quite a bit more ambitious than one might think. Far removed from your typical horror film, this is a thoughtful, introspective journey into ruined lives, failed ambitions and uncertainty. Think Harmony Korine crossed with Andrei Tarkovsky and you're on the right track. Unexpectedly engrossing.",1388016000,13,308,5.574468085106383
5969538,4,B00F878K0W,"Simple edition of a greatmovie i watched in the first Nocturna Film Festival of Madrid in 2013. I recomend this movie to everyone, specially genere fans who like experimental indie movies like this one.",1466812800,,202,4.970588235294118
5969539,5,B00F878K0W,Good for a very certain type of audience...,1464134400,,43,4.5
5969540,2,B00F878K0W,"I like slow burn horror.  For instance, I love the first ""Paranormal Activity"" movie, and ""The House of the Devil.""  I also liked Willow Creek quite a bit, so let's admit folks, I have patience.  But there was a payoff -- all of those have a steadily building sense of dread, and that's really lacking from Toad Road.  Toad Road is more Mumblecore about drug-using kids in flyover country, and the whole ""gates of hell"" thing is just an ill-fitting detour from that aimless and not terribly interesting story.  If you want to see it as a straight-up mumblecore with some paranormal elements, be my guest.  But if you're looking for the horror experience, and I mean just about any element of it, suggest you look elsewhere.",1461715200,2,723,4.653543307086614
5969541,1,B00F878K0W,What the hell was that crap???  How was this a horror movie?  It was just a bunch of douchebags doing drugs.,1461542400,3,108,4.095238095238095
5969542,2,B00F878K0W,"I watched this on account of the title, which featured in an urban legend I heard as a young teen in PA. But it has nothing to do with the urban legend I heard. For me, watching people get high on psychedelics is really really boring. and I don't think it's very cutting edge, since I did the same with my friends 40 years ago. Plus one of the main characters' rent is being paid by his father, even though he looks like he's in his late 20s.  I turned it off after a guy snorfed a condom up his nose. You know? High school. It was boring, and it was a long time ago.",1459555200,2,567,3.9304347826086956
5969543,3,B00F878K0W,couldn't get into it as much as I tried,1449705600,,39,3.4444444444444446
5969544,4,B00F878K0W,"I actually really liked this movie, but I know people who hate it.  I think its one of those.  As I was watching it, I realized that the 7 Gates of Hell were actually a metaphor for drug addiction, and then the movie made a lot more sense, even if the end doesn't wrap things up well.  I thought it was just OK at first, but then something weird happened then next day as I kept going over the movie in my head, thinking about it a lot.  I think that's the sign of an effective movie.  The fact that one of the actresses died of an accidental drug overdose soon after its release makes it that much creepier.  The end of the movie is my only gripe, because with just a short scene they could have tied it all together and made the main character realize what really happened, and his memory loss was due to his abuse.  Pretty simple for them to have done, but its an indie film, so everything has to be vague, right?",1407715200,3,916,4.112359550561798
5969545,5,B00F878K0W,"Toad Road is a modern look at the old-fashioned urban legend. The young people involved are grappling with internal demons, which may possibly manifest as external demons. Definitely gritty and not for sissies, a tough look at some of the issues today's youth are facing with a macabre twist. Some very fine acting.",1401753600,,315,4.962264150943396
5969546,4,B00F878K0W,"The details are fuzzy in my mind since I watched it a while back and could've sworn I reviewed it but... The actors are definitely genuine. I felt like I had known some back in the day. I googled afterwards and read that some of them were not actors but were cast  because they embodied the character. By cast, I do not mean via a regular casting call but picked off the street. There are some hallucinatory scenes, surreal touches, which were very nice. The atmosphere is effectively creepy. The horror is more of  'a lurking fear' than an overt one. It is more arthouse than mainstream. If you are into that, then dial it up. If not, and are curious, you might like it too.",1399248000,,675,4.349206349206349
5969547,1,B00F878K0W,"This movie was not entertaining. This movie was not well acted. This movie has no redeeming value. The characters were extremely unlikable. In regard to watching movies, I have never felt such boredom and hate at the same time. It was like seating a hour in a dentist chair waiting for a tooth to be pulled. The only relief comes once it's over. The 7 gates of hell metaphor referred to in the movie more aptly describes watching the movie, rather than the downward spiral of drug abuse. I can only hope that when I wake up in the morning, my memories of watching this movie start to fade.",1394582400,2,589,4.412844036697248
8612947,5,B00F878K0W,Outstanding movie.  A rare take in a genre full of cutting room switches to tongue in cheek horror comedies in that it stays true to its goal of portraying realistic characters following a realistic trajectory through extreme circumstances.,1528675200,,240,5.315789473684211
8612948,5,B00F878K0W,I really loved this movie.,1528156800,,26,4.4
8612949,3,B00F878K0W,First off it's not horror. It's a bunch of kids getting high. The last 30 mins get a creepy and weird. But there is no closure. What ever happened to the girl?,1525478400,,159,4.0
8612950,1,B00F878K0W,Stupid,1525392000,,6,6.0
8612951,5,B00F878K0W,I thought this film was intense.  Some will probably find it intensely boring.  I imagine it depends on how relevant the characters are to the viewer.,1521936000,,150,4.730769230769231
8612952,4,B00F878K0W,"Worth a watch if you can look past the low production value (it's shot on a nonprofessional camera without lighting; I suspect the director was going for a found footage aesthetic); it has several elements to recommend it: there are some interesting performances given by nonprofessional actors, including by model Sara Anne Jones, who died of a heroin overdose after the film was released (google her name, her story is haunting in its own right). It alternately reminds me in parts of better films, such as Jacob's Ladder (as James processes what might have been his and/or her death), and Romper Stomper or Green Room, which introduce you to kids living in a subculture (this one is centered around drug usage). But I can appreciate films that attempt something different, even if, in the end, it proves just slightly out of reach. Jones is captivating initially and the documentary film shots of the ""actors"" doing drugs is arresting, while the absent Jones haunts the final scenes of the film.",1510185600,2,998,4.911242603550296
