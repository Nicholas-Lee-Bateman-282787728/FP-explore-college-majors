6168617,2,B00HLTD6E0,"It was too hyped up.  I expected more from the movie, but was greatly disappointed.  You basically saw most of the action in the trailers, which ruined it for me.  And I thought the Jeff Bridges acting was too flat.  The story was thin, and the action/special effects were good for the most part, but I left feeling very bland, I wish I would have waited for the DVD release.  Waste of money if you ask me.",1425168000,2,406,4.220779220779221
6168618,4,B00HLTD6E0,I went to see it in the theater with some friends and we enjoyed.  I liked the story and I thought the flow of the movie went well.,1424822400,,131,3.6785714285714284
6168619,4,B00HLTD6E0,"Seventh Son offers a very expansive world filled with large beasts, special effects and swords and sorcery in a smorgasbord of entertaining Fantasy cinema, with the talents of Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore and more. Fans of Medieval Fantasy Movies will find much to enjoy in Seventh Son, which involves the recruitment of Tom Ward, the reported Seventh Son, with special powers soon to be harnessed and revealed through the guidance of the feisty and ornery old Jeff Bridges, as John Gregory, a Hunter of sorts, determined to spell the end of the evil Witch Malkin (Julianne).
The movie includes a lot of escapades as Ward and Gregory quest through forests filled with dead souls, a castle with a red eyed demon knight, a prison room with a gargantuan man Bear Beast, a bursting driller Giant, waterfalls, gorgeous scenery that reminds one of Middle Earth (New Zealand), Dragons, Trolls, Witches, an expert swordsman with four arms, Creatures of all kinds, a beautiful princess, towns, cliffs, hills, mountains and much more in this sprawling epic fantasy. If these features have you interested, don't pass up Seventh Son.
The 3D special effects are powerful during much of Seventh Son, and make you feel like you are there, looking over a pouring waterfall with depth and dimension 2D could never capture. While not every sequence is full blast 3D, the ones that count are plentiful and thrilling. The outstanding 3D really adds to the excitement of Seventh Son. If you have a 3DTV, this is the version to purchase.",1423699200,134,1515,4.9450980392156865
6168620,1,B00HLTD6E0,"Almost everything is off with this adaptation of ""The Spook's Apprentice"" by Joseph Delaney. It took the movie three years from principal photography in 2012 to cinematic release in 2015, but the thing is that this movie was destined to fail from day one.

This adaptation suffers from the same basic flaw the Percy Jackson movies did: CASTING CHOICES! Only this time, is ten times worse! Remember they had turned 12-year-old into a 16-year-old played by a 17-year-old Logan Lerman? Now, prepare yourself for supposedly 12-year-old Tom Ward to be portayed by then 31-year-old Ben Barnes as a sorcerer's apprentice in a medieval world...

Really? Back then, the average life expectation was about 35, so Ben Barnes could have easily played The Master! But let's forget those historical details, it's supposed to be fantasy anyway...
But the thing is that a 31-year-old main character simply destroyes the entire magic and sense of wonder of such a project! It's supposed to be a children's movie based on a children's book, and not one of those young adult angst flicks!

With a multitude of really talented young actors out there these days, it's a shame they went for that ""Ben Barnes"" solution. Some of the arguably best fantasy adaptations (besides all of Middle-Earth) - and for sure the most successful ones - are the Harry Potter series and the first Chronicles of Narnia movie! Both series featured apt child actors in these roles and did very well that way... Imagine a 30-something-year old actor as Harry Potter in his first year at Hogwarts? Odd idea, isn't it?

But this is exactly what they've done here! And it's infuriating to say the least... Either stick with the books basic elements, such as plot, age of the characters etc. or do your own original movies not based on books... But this is simply outrageous!

If you want to have the next Harry Potter, get a 12-year-old to play a 12-year-old! Stop this ""young adult"" nonsense no kid can relate to...",1423353600,6,1969,4.848214285714286
6168621,4,B00HLTD6E0,"Okaaaayyyy...Here we're fighting evil spirits. If you are the seventh son of a seventh son, that makes you the local spook. It is up to you to run off evil spirits, witches and other pesky threats. Problem is, you can't stop time and you are getting old and weary. So far, you haven't been able to find an apprentice who can survive long enough to do the job. Who will take over?

This PG-13 movie, directed by Sergei Bodrov, combines the usual grotesque monsters, dragons and witches with a sweet romance between two attractive (and NICE!) young people.  What a welcome change of pace. Of course the bar keeps going up as more and more disgusting monsters leap off the 3D screen, but at least we have someone to root for.

We see:
  * Ben Barnes (""Prince Caspian"") is Tom Ward, sold by his parents to the spook... who is NOT impressed! Our hero learns a LOT, but much of it he would rather not know. He wishes he were a sixth son!
  * Jeff Bridges (""True Grit"" - 2010) is Master Gregory, the aging spook who can't seem to keep his apprentices alive long enough to learn their trade.
  * Julianne Moore (""The Hunger Games"") is Mother Malkin, a witch who escapes from safekeeping and is out for revenge (big surprise, huh?)
  * Alicia Vikander (""Anna Karenina"") plays Alice, the sweet niece of that nasty Mother Malkin. Alice is a failed witch and Tom is a failed spook: at least they have SOMETHING in common!
  * Djimon Hounsou (""Guardians of the Galaxy"") Radu is Mother Malkin's go-to guy when it comes to beating the living daylights out of her enemies.

As someone who lived on a farm as a child, I always shake my head when I see how ignorant filmmakers are about what I consider basic things, e.g., they have our hero strewing corn on the ground in the pigpen. That's how you feed chickens, not pigs! Aarghhh.",1423094400,57,1815,4.460606060606061
6168622,4,B00HLTD6E0,"I really don't know why this movie is not well seen. On a second thought maybe I know why, but still I keep my 4 stars alive. The critiques are that its not too original, full of clichs or boring.

I think is a very decent movie with great subtle messages. In my opinion its about showing the importance of balance between good or bad, that no one is 100% bad or 100% good and that is a story to every good or bad behavior. A similar message comes about the temptation  which many times take over - to get converted by evil and lose your way.

Also, the movie emphasizes about the importance of following your destiny, digging deeper in things, waiting for the right moments and willing to make sacrifices in life. I think even if its a fantasy has good real life messages, therefore are never enough to be heard and applied.",1421798400,86,825,4.309677419354839
6168623,3,B00HLTD6E0,"This is a simple story of good vs. evil. Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) is a knight/spook and the last of his kind who fights ""creatures of the dark."" He is up against a bunch of them lead by Mother Malkin (Julianna Moore) and not  Maleficent as that would lead to a lawsuit. Gregory has been going through apprentices like water and has been following in the latest Hollywood B movie craze by having our hero being someone who drinks too much. His next apprentice to help him fight evil is the seventh son of a seventh son, Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) a scrawny pig farmer who likes to throw knives. He has his own secret. There is also Alice (Alicia Vikander) the niece of Mother Malkin who adds a Romeo and Juliet element to the tale.

I liked the special effects and Julianne Moore as the witch, but who cast ""The Dude"" in the role of the Master? It was horrible. It ruined an otherwise good film.

I am a huge Jeff Bridges fan and  he was superb in this movie. Set in medieval times, Jeff Bridges and his apprentice are responsible for ridding the world of witches and their evil associates.

I mean, really! Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Alicia Vikander, Djimon Hounsou can't make a good movie? Is there no hope left in the world? Hell, even Kit  Harington has a few minutes on screen.

I will say that the movie gets a little better towards the middle when Alicia Vikander starts talking (but even she can't truly save that dialog) and  a little more towards the end when there's less talking and more action. If I could rate the the two halves of the movie I'd give the first 1/5 stars and the second 3/5. And somebody needs to fix whatever's wrong with Jeff Bridges mouth.",1484352000,,747,4.437956204379562

His casting was probably the wrong one.  And his acting, his portrayal of the central character was sooooo bad.  I can't imagine what he was trying to convey, but it was aweful.  As he is in almost every single scene, he cannot be avoided.  There are other issues with dialogue but those are minor.  The special effects and CGI are very well done.  A shame really.  Don't spend a single $ on this stinker!!  What's really funny?  I had rented it about one year ago and got about 20 minutes in before quitting.  I forgot!!  I rented it a second time.  Yikes!

There is action, beautiful scenery, fantastical creatures, a bit of a twist, and a touch of romance in this sorcerer versus witch film. I almost wrote good versus evil, but that does not actually fit. Without hopefully giving anything away, the film basically covers the main character's initiation into the legacy his birthing inheritance bestows upon him to the ongoing struggle against the dark forces. Before that point, Gregory, the Jeff Bridges character, and his companion are the last remnant of the light forces, once a vast army. The only complaint I have would be Gregory's speech mannerism. It's not really an accent. I am not sure what Jeff Bridges was going for. In any case, ""Seventh Son"" is an enjoyable fantasy.",1481155200,,896,4.824675324675325

Whats her name, Moore, was also really bad. (is she supposed to be attractive?....about as attractive as jeffy bridges I guess) These people get paid millions of dollars to do a cruddy job.

Ive seen several movies where he has this bushel of a beard, is grizzled and speaks in a huff-n-puff style (consider True Grit, R.I.P.D., and The Giveroh! and in the 1976 version of King Kong!). Its almost a caricature! Hes like Tommy Lee Jones! Anyway, Seventh Son carries on this particular Bridges aesthetic and makes it feel more natural as he is a knight of sorts, Master Gregory, who hunts witches and other occult creatures in a dark, medieval age. But hes lost his apprentice to a dragon-witch and now he takes up another, a seventh son of a seventh son, as dictated by prophecies someone with abilities beyond mere mortal men. Unfortunately for his new apprentice Tom Ward (who is unknowingly the son of a witch), Tom doesnt seem to really have abilities beyond mere men. And so goes some of the mild humor of this fantasy film that is affable with good special effects but brings nothing new to the genre. Alicia Vikander who broke big in her next movie, Ex Machina, gets a co-starring role here as the daughter of a witch who inevitably falls in love with Tom. Its all very easy, moderately likable, and just as easy to forget. 3.75 stars.",1477699200,3,1185,4.62085308056872

6169548,1,B00HLTD6E0,"What a train wreck. Obviously they decided to spend all their budget on hiring good actors, research, and cgi. And zero money on script. Sigh. Bridges talks with marbles in his mouth, making weird jokes and being shallow. Ben Barnes did not age well, poor chemistry and wooden. Julianne is under developed and seems miscast. Then there are a bunch of side characters. It is obvious they put alot of time and effort in researching who they should be/look. The problem with that is that most get about 5 minutes of screen time. I do like the idea that no one is completely evil or good. The plot, in general, was thin and dialogue very, very awkward. I fast forwarded all the fight scenes. Then for the climax I had to rewind to see who actually beat the witch. SPOILER: not the main characters! The director was 'try harding' all over the place except the one place you can't leave out: the plot.",1466208000,,895,4.4969325153374236

6169556,5,B00HLTD6E0,"Good movie with a Chronicles of Narnia / Lord of the Rings feel. The action through most of the movie is pretty good, though I think the end could have been a lot better.  I go back and forth about Julianne Moore's movies - I think she was the weakest actor in this film.  The other players are all pretty talented.  John Snow from Game of Thrones makes an appearance but doesn't last long...sorry ladies.",1464998400,,405,4.373333333333333
6169557,4,B00HLTD6E0,There needs to be a lot more character development in this story.  I mean saying that someone is the seventh son of a seventh son sounds like it might be significant somehow since it is in the title.  But it isn't explained and could use a lot of character development.  This story really could have been epic.  Instead they made it short and took out most of the meaning.  Still graphics are pretty good.  Acting seems good.  I liked it because it was engaging.  Still my mind screams I want story and you keep giving me thriller!,1464998400,,531,4.402061855670103

6169581,5,B00HLTD6E0,Good storyline,1464480000,,14,6.5
6169582,3,B00HLTD6E0,"I decided to see this movie for one reason, Alicia Vikander.  I fell so hard for her in Ex Machina and everything since, Im going back to pick up on her earlier films that I hadnt seen.  But shes not the only Oscar winner in the movie.  Theres also Julianne Moore (Still Alice) and Jeff Bridges (Crazy Heart).  And theres also Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond).  If that isn't enough, Game of Thrones most popular actor, Kit Harington aka Jon Snow is also here.

The lead however is Ben Barnes (Narnia) who plays Tom Ward, the seventh son of a seventh son who is destined to become an apprentice to Bridgess Master Gregory, known as a spook.  His job is to keep the creepy creatures, especially witches under control.  In this ancient land somewhere between Narnia and Westeros, the Queen witch known as Mother Malkin (Moore, milking every scene for all its worth) has escaped her dungeon thanks to the red moon and her ability to become a dragon.  So Dungeons and Dragons I guess.  Gregory wants her put back.

Tom, fortunately has a secret weapon given to him by his mom (Olivia Williams, Maps to the Stars) who unbeknownst to Tom is a secret (good) witch herself.  Oh yeah, Ms. Vikander.  She is the daughter of a witch who reports to the Queen, but whose accidental interaction with Tom, suggests she aint all bad either.  And she likes Tom.  And Tom likes her.

As you might suspect, the film, adapted from Joseph Delaneys novel isn't anything new.  Under Sergey Bodrovs direction, has a lot of dead spots.  Still there are some terrific CGI monsters and mystical fun.  But I don't think that was enough to create any new nominations.",1463875200,,1650,4.608247422680412

6169584,2,B00HLTD6E0,"I've read the series that this movie is loosely based upon, and it is very loose.  Loose as a goose, I say!  It's a run-of-the-mill fantasy, and the only thing I found enjoyable was Bridges' performance as the Spook, with his cold, yet comedic remarks, throughout the film.  If you are unaware of the book series, this can be an enjoyable film.  But I cant..  I just can't!  All things aside, the filming is polished, and the locations are nice.",1463356800,,445,4.5

6169587,2,B00HLTD6E0,and I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges.  His acting seems so fake and he's hard to understand because he's trying to make his voice sound like Gandalf in Lord of the Rings. Very phony acting for such a well-known actor.,1463270400,,210,4.25
6169608,4,B00HLTD6E0,"This was a pretty good movie, we did make the purchase which was stored to our amazon fire stick. You typically can't go wrong with a movie that has Jeff Bridges in it and accompanied with Juliana Moore.  The movie is definitely action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat kind of deal. I however am used to seeing Jeff Bridges in Drama or Comedy films. This was different for him in my opinion and yet he still managed to pull it off. I think this scenario is a little overdone and I just felt like or was expecting a little more from it. Juliana Moore outdone herself as the villain quite honestly. The special effects were pretty amazing as well but it just kind of lacked something for me. Jeff Bridges saves the day and there are some comedic parts involved. I mean the film has a little bit of everything in it sci-fi, action, comedy, and drama. For me, maybe it was just seeing Jeff Bridges as a fantasy character that saves the day that threw me off a little bit.",1463011200,,980,4.268817204301075

The plot is very stupid and predictably about witches and the the guy hunts them. Moore does the best she can without laughing. And Bridges, who is hardly recognizable, looking to be about 90 years old and using a voice that could only be described as gravelly. The movie has a ton of British actors that use their American accents. That was confusing.

Especially being familiar with the original source material, it's interesting to see how much they changed and the most likely reasons why (mostly to pander to as many neatly check-boxed groups as possible, other than anyone who read any of the books at all). Yet another example of why some authors are obsessively involved with movies based on their books - this is what happens if they aren't (not as bad as World War Z, at least, but still so terrible).",1449014400,2,613,4.433628318584071

6169997,5,B00HLTD6E0,"I've watched this movie 20 times now and it gets better and better.  It definitely deserves a sequel because of the chemistry among the actors, the exceptionally great special effects, very good directing, production and script writing.  I view this film as a classic for Halloween theme movie.  Jeff Bridges character really grew on me over time ... he's perfect for this movie.

Things they need to improve upon most is cinematography:  some of the scenes were soft (slightly out of focused) some were in focus with a lot of depth.  Some of this softness was done in post production where all scenes were purposefully softened to hide the mistake of some scenes being soft.  I saw this in the USA 2D version.  I also bought the version from Germany:  this version came in 3D and 2D (USA had no 3D).  The German version had some scenes very much in-focus with good depth and some were soft.  The 3D version had elevated brightness along with sharper image clarity and details.  One needs elevated brightness to compensate for the light loss due to wearing 3D glasses (~25% light loss).  These people know how to do 3D.",1448582400,,1119,4.676923076923077

Downer is the overnight transformation from farm boy to warrior/mage with no time elapse for training or explanation of the sudden prowess in weapons and power.  OK so you have to suspend reality to be in the world to begin with but I have always felt that is a crucial part of any transition from tweenager to adult hero kind of story.  I will be searching for the books this is based on as those probably have a bit more of that.,1446336000,,525,4.326530612244898

6170136,5,B00HLTD6E0,"WOW!!!  I don't know how I missed this one when it came out but I am glad I was able to find it on Amazon.com & add it to my collection.  I saw one review calling this a B-rate movie...Not at all!!!  Plenty of big named stars preforming well & the special effects are top notch!  I saw another review claiming Jeff Bridges was hard to understand, and it is true that he adopts a bit of a speech impediment .  He may have done this to help him pull off a English accent.  It works well for his battle hardened character, I had a friend who after breaking his jaw sounded very much like Jeff Bridges character in this movie.  Julianne Moore does a fine job as the evil ""Mother of all Witches""  And this is certainly not Ben Barnes first foray into the Sword & Sorcery genre.  The other creatures & Warlocks are recognizable from other films & I love the way the witches & warlocks have alternate creatures they can turn into this is a nice touch & really raises the bar when it comes down to the battle scenes!  I don't want to give away spoilers so I will just say there's a lot more going on than just good against evil in this movie.  Now I am 50 years old & I tend to be generous when rating movies even if they are lower budget movies, I figure if they entertain me on said given budget I rate them high.  But I didn't notice a lack of budget in either the actors hired or the special effects but just to make sure I asked my 19 year old daughter & she agreed this is far from B-rate material.  If you are a fan of the Sword & Sorcery genre I don't think you will regret adding this one to your collection.  This movie is action packed and fast paced with a touch of humor to keep it from being to dark.  basically its fun for the whole family but might be a bit to creepy for little children.  While the movie is fast paced it still manages enough character development to endear the characters to the viewer & the characters are complex enough to hold your interest.",1446076800,3,1971,4.12041884816754

6170194,2,B00HLTD6E0,"While we all know that movies don't follow the book to a T this one blows the train off the rail that's on a bridge to the bottom of the ocean. First off the house, setting, how the spook approaches the house has absolutely NOTHING  to do with the book. The first night Thomas is with Mr. Gregory he took him to a haunted house and locked him in. One of the biggest parts of the book that is even a reference in many of the other books.  Nope nothing. The training that took place in his vast garden with his notebook.. nah never happened. His training was 2 weeks if I remember from the movie and the majority of it was throwing knives. (To which even my friends found quite odd) what about the boggart living in the home? Pretty sure it was mentioned once. ONCE totally one of the key secondary characters, almost good enough to call a low primary character. Let's see what about Alice making Tom feed the witch in the pit in the garden?  Nah not that big of a deal.. let's see was it done anything like the first book... not really. Yes the story kinda follows it... though Tom becomes a spook at the end of the movie which is kinda ridiculous considering he had about 2.5 - 3 years worth of training just in the series. What about the mother of Tom? The one who is supposed to be a extremely powerful witch who has the power to repel the devil... nah she dies pretty fast. Just if your a fan of the series it's gonna hurt if you watch it. I was really looking forward to it and had my hopes crushed",1445126400,,1502,4.154639175257732

If you can't get over that, your probably not going to like it. However, I bought into his character pretty quickly and really enjoyed him after about 15 minutes. It was a rousing tale of Witches and Spooks (witch hunters) and monsters and dragons and magic. They did a great job of adding a little depth to the movie. There were shades of grey to the good and evil. There was also a little back story that explained the motivations of the characters.

It has some nice moments both in terms of special effects, the ideas behind them, how they are done, as well as characters.. thanks to a
great cast and a pretty smart director. But, if you want to be knocked out, maybe netflix game of thrones.

Jeff Bridges was a bit odd, but he's a Great Actor Man, and that's not a surprise.

No such luck.

Instead, we get Julianne Moore doing her best to chew up the scenery and Jeff Bridges talking through a mouthful of marbles when he's not dispatching anyone who annoys him, and some milquetoast male lead involved with a completely pointless female lead whom no one ever tells to shut up (and more's the pity) and even that description sounds more enjoyable than the reality. Why? Because the reality is just boring, and all of the actors (except the enjoyable Ms Moore) are simply going through the motions to try to bring to life an utterly flaccid script.

6170793,4,B00HLTD6E0,"The Spook ( a rather up-to-date term for someone in such a medieval setting) is the last remaining member of a group that hunts supernatural creatures. Years before he imprisoned Mother Malkin, the dragon queen of the supernaturals in an underground tomb but now, through the power of the blood moon which shines only once a century, she's escaped and he has to finish what he started.  Losing his apprentice to MM, he seeks another and finds him in Thomas, who is not only the seventh son of a seventh son but also the son of a witch.  Double whammy! The story from there takes the usual turns through a series of vignettes as Thomas is taught  what he needs to know by the crusty ghost hunter, meets the girl of his dreams only to discovers she's part of Mother Makin's entourage, and etc., on to its inevitable and expected end.

The story is nothing new though the creatures inhabiting it are CGi-good. I did like the ghasts (particle remaining behind of those who have passed on, not to be confused with ghosts),There are some very good cinematic shots of mountains and blood moons in various aspects. The hero is earnest, the heroine vacillates between good and not so but otherwise isn't anything spectacular.  My one complaint about the characters would be Jeff Bridges' Spook who speaks through the entire story as if he has a mouth full of mush. At the beginning and occasionally throughout, his accent, if it can be called that, is so...something...he was barely intelligible at times.

All in all, it's an entertaining piece. Loved the many weapons and charms Spook carries with which to entrap the creatures. It was a bit disappointing to see Kit Harington (Game of Thrones) in such a brief and minor role since the blurb I read played up his part so. I'd expected him to be the seventh son.  I would also place this story in about the 12th or 13th century instead of the 18th as the sleeve blurb stated. Since the film is adapted from the first book of a trilogy, and though the movie has a finish--sort of--it's going to be interesting to see if they bring the other two novels to the screen or let things stay as is.

This DVD was viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1440028800,,2229,4.541147132169576

With that said I have to admit that I liked this movie.  That is saying a lot.  I am not a great fan of Jeff Bridges and when he first appeared, larger than life and with a mouthful of marbles,  it did not help me to like the movie.  However, his character grew on me and, while I still am not one of Jeff Bridges greatest fans, I started accepting him in this role.  He turned out to be a lot better than I expected and I like it when that happens.

Julian Moore never fails to amaze me.  I can't say that she was out of her element because she plays so many different characters (and plays them well) that it is hard for me to say what her element is.  I gain more respect for her every time I see her in another role.  She was pretty good in this one too.  She didn't overplay the wicked witch angle and that would have been very easy for her to do.

I always feel that romance doesn't belong in the Fantasy genre.  The romance in this movie was not overpowering and I really appreciated that.

Overall, I finished this movie entertained and with a good feeling.  Isn't that what a Fantasy movie is supposed to do?",1439164800,,1342,4.096153846153846

A lot of the storytelling was, ""these two characters have a history, that's why you should care,"" ""these two could have a future, that's why you should care."" I would have enjoyed a longer movie and a little bit more care given to the emotional development between most of the characters. That said, see it, it's good, and made me wonder if there is a book from which I could get the actual story. Also - Jeff Bridges' character choices in it are kind of fun.

6171041,5,B00HLTD6E0,"This 3d film was released the same day as 'Jupiter rising' which was a decent fun popcorn sci fi film.  This is a decent  fun sword and sorcery film.
The effects are outstanding and the story is taken from a graphic novel.  The story concerns the last witchfighter knight and his protg fighting against the evil witches led by julliane moore's character.  You have two great actors in this film and that elevates it somewhat.  The story is a simple one of good versus evil and the 3d is excellent. Of course critics will hate this movie , it's a b movie with a large budget.  And that is worth watching for sure. 3d films are best at the theater due to the nature of 3d. But this version on your tv will do if you didn't make the trip to the theater. I always recommend seeing a 3d film first in the theater before wasting viewing this type of movie.  Still if you want a simple sword and sorcery film this one may be for you.  I bought the 3d blu ray off amazon.de.  It is in English and I have a all region 3d blu ray player.  I am sorry for those of you who don't own a all region 3d blu ray player because you are STUCK with the flat 2d version.",1438128000,,1149,4.066666666666666

6171067,4,B00HLTD6E0,"The Seventh Son of the Seventh Son 'Tom Ward' (Ben Barnes) seemingly the son of simple farmers is sought out
and paid for by 'Master Gregory' (Jeff Bridges) the sole remaining warrior of the Mystical Order (A Spook) to serve
as his apprentice.
'Master Gregory' battles against the Dark Forces, normally it takes ten years to train an apprentice, however 'Tom'
who has inherited powers he's yet to learn of, has just one week to learn he necessary skills before embarking upon
the battle to come against the powerful 'Dark Queen' (Julianne Moore) who can transform herself into a Dragon, she
also commands many powerful allies including those that can transform into fearsome creatures.
'Master Gregory' along with his faithful servant 'Tusk' (John Desantis) and apprentice 'Tom' must be ready before the
'Red Moon' which will herald the heights of the 'Dark Queen's' powers.
The walled city which is under threat from the Queens attention will pay 'Master Gregory' to protect them, if he can
that is, the signal they use to summon the 'Spook' is the Bell in the tower.
Of course as is tradition, there is romance in the air between 'Tom' and the 'Dark Queen's' sisters Daughter 'Alice'
(Alicia Vikander) who 'Tom' had saved earlier in the walled City from being burnt by the hoards as a Witch.
This a mystical fantasy adventure in which the evil forces that only the 'Spook' and his two companions can combat...
the Kingdom is at risk if 'Master Gregory' and the 'Seventh Son' fail.
This a superb fantasy tale in which 'Jeff Bridges' is masterful as the Mystic-Warrior.
A special-effects treat
(Kit Harrington (Game of Thrones) has a brief role in the film)
A word of caution, some visual sequences may not be suitable for younger viewers (it's a dark tale)

6171071,1,B00HLTD6E0,"I honestly didn't recognize this movie as being based on ""The Last Apprentice"" (the US title of the first book of the series).  Here's a good example of the problems in taking a YA novel and trying to turn it into a deep, dark, action-packed movie for adults.  It didn't work.  Jeff Bridges sounds like he has a mouthful of marbles throughout the movie - I seriously wondered if he was ill.  Our ""hero"" is... dull.  Our heroine is pouty.  There's no one to LIKE in this movie (except the horse).  It's dull, predictable, plodding, and packed with about every ""sexy evil witch and co."" clich in the book.  Seems like all the bad guys can turn themselves into dragons, yet they don't when it would be really useful to do so.  And yet, with all this power, all it takes in one case to defeat a bad guy is to ram him with a pitchfork.  Consistency is NOT a major player.

6171358,4,B00HLTD6E0,"Folklore, superstition and old wives tales, come alive, on this single DVD disc with a running time of 1 hour and 42 minutes which features and depicts the lore of THE SEVENTH SON. Entwined with the witchcraft from which it stems, the mystique, the powers and the enchantment, come to the big screen in this mythological, action/adventure, story. Although he was aware that he was born to a mortal seventh son and that he himself, is a seventh son, he was unaware of the destiny, the magic, mystery and witchcraft that he was born, into. Actor Jeff Bridges portrays the last of a noble order of knights, that have sworn themselves to integrity and the physical and spiritual battle against witchcraft, demons, imps, minions, monsters, warlocks and the like..., for the salvation of mankind. And so, THE SEVENTH SON must make a choice: Will he serve darkness and bondage or will he yield to the light and freedom? The knight tries to teach THE SEVENTH SON but will this pre-destined son, allow himself to be taught? Or will the dark powers of witchcraft encase him in deceptive bondage? And just what is the prophecy concerning THE SEVENTH SON and will it come true? The 'bonus features' include the visual effects gallery and an interesting nugget, about: ""The Legend and Lore of THE SEVENTH SON."" A fantasy action/adventure.

His acting consisted of speaking as if his mouth was full of marbles while he pretended to be an old man.  The two young leads were wooden and stiff with absolutely no chemistry or personality.

6171429,1,B00HLTD6E0,"An unknown director tries his hand at a big budget fantasy and fails, seems like a running trend in Hollyweird anymore.  While we are on the subject, here's another puzzling and disturbing trend; trying to make a good vs. evil flick where the characters are so much of both, the whole purpose and conflict gets lost in translation.  Okay, now that we have covered that, the effects are decent but the cinematography is so rapid and clunky you miss out on a lot of it.  And the concept ain't half bad; slightly original, but it is so poorly executed and acted that any hint of uniqueness or hope of engagement is totally lost.  As for the cast, for starters, Bridges is simply awful.  He tries to be a dark, surly, scorned warrior, but it ends up looking like a bad copy of something Harrison Ford would have been typecast in but readily turned down.  Add in, Harington whose performance is so lackluster his character should have been called the Sominex Son.  His love interest, Vikander fares no better.  Moore is the only bright spot in this medieval mess, playing her version of an edgier and more evil Jolie in Maleficent.  But it is not bright enough to shine any redeeming light on the remaining ensemble or overall story, however.  Hopefully cinematic birth control is introduced to this potential franchise to avoid the conception of any further sequel siblings.",1436054400,,1370,4.718487394957983

This movie is one where they take a great series of novels, buy the rights, then CHANGE IT ALL! Why? This never fails to amaze me. Why change something that works so well?the series of movies could have been excellent but by changing the story and letting Jeff Bridges ham it up and act ridiculous they pretty much ensure we will never see another Seventh Son movie. It's a damn shame!

Enjoyable fantasy. I really liked this movie, which surprised me. The biggest problem (other than the CGI) is Jeff Bridges. He is a good actor and could have pulled this off, but he seems to feel the need to do some sort of accent that garbles every word he says. I am not sure what kind of accent it is because he does it randomly and poorly. It sounds like he has a mouth full of marbles or something.

The second Jeff Bridges opens his mouth and speaks (which sounds like he has about 4 rubber balls in his mouth) and throughout the entire movie, you feel like Jeff's saying ""Clean my jowls"". Bc his jowls literally shake through the entire movie.
They barely touch on who the heck these people are. Oh hey look I'm a momma's boy and this guys gonna take me away bc of reasons.
The only interesting thing, was the beginning, when the guy that plays Jon Snow from GOT is there, but he dies. Fast. And that's the best part. After that, oh hey look demon who isn't explained. And other demons who aren't explained. Demon escapes bc of course nobody thinks to just KILL THE EVIL BAD GUY and instead imprison her. She meets up with other demons yada yada yada, chaos. Some sort of jewel that isn't explained....ugh....
And of course the main momma's boy character becomes a partial badass in a day for simply existing. Jeff Bridges talking is simply the worst. You just wanna say stop. Julianne Moore does a decent job. Not her fault the stories terrible.
Watch it for a good laugh, almost as a spoof. Bc you'll laugh at it more than anything. And more than a few parts you'll think ""WTF was that?? What just happened?? Really???""

The way he portrayed Master Gregory was completely opposite from how he was described in the book.

6171581,4,B00HLTD6E0,"Ok, first off. This movie is only a small fraction of what the books were. Many and I mean MANY things were changed from the books to the movie. They left out so many key (and awesome) components of the book which were Toms mam being one of the first witches ever, the entire deal between the ultimate darkness (the devil) and Tom and Alice, COMPLETELY left out Grimalkin (extremely disappointed because she was one of my favorite characters throughout the book series), they never went to Ireland, never went into the darkness, Tom never slows down time like he slowly masters in the books, ect ect. Which I was kind of upset that the movie was so... short to say the least. they should've stuck to the book more and made this into a trilogy. But, I am a fan of the books. So with what was put into the movie, I have to say that it wasn't bad. I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I STRONGLY recommend reading the books. They are FANTASTIC which is an understatement. Also, boggarts are not impossible to kill. There are many in the books, and even Mr. Gregory has one in the form of a cat that protects his house (and destroys it protecting it in one of the books)",1435536000,,1160,4.350230414746544

6171584,4,B00HLTD6E0,"Maybe it's the accent that Jeff Bridges assumes. Maybe its the attempt to adapt and re-use obscure literary characters who are little-recognized outside the original children's books.  Maybe it's just that critics have forgotten the little eight-year old within themselves.

But so be it. The critics panned this one.  I don't agree with them.

This film was delayed multiple times for special effects reasons and I feel like it was released in February mostly as a write off.  And that's too bad.  It spins out an idiosyncratic storyline with very engaging young actors (who I wish we had seen more of frankly) and few older ones hamming it up too.  The conclusion is satisfying but almost screams -- ""set up for a sequel.""  Which will doubtless never happen.  I had to work harder to get this in 3D and ordered from HK.  Totally worth it.

I love every hokey, wonderful minute of this film.  And, one day, I hope to be proven wrong about the sequel.",1435536000,,951,4.662650602409639

The last of the protectors keeping us from the evil that whites do has a habit of having his apprentices dispatched by the opposition.

6171683,3,B00HLTD6E0,"Here's the thing: Seventh Son is based off a book (which I have not read, so, there's going to be something more for those who want to see their book characters played by Jeff Bridges) and it was a long time coming. When I saw the first teaser trailer several years ago my immediate assumption was ""oh wow, they're making a movie of The Witcher!"". Nope. Something called Seventh Son...Hmm...After reading up on the book a bit though, and making a few guesses from the trailer, I decided ""OK well, it's not The Witcher, but it might be the closest we get to a Hollywood-released film LIKE The Witcher. That is, an old monster-hunter, one of the last in a line of a noble profession now all but extinct, must train up a new 'nobody' apprentice to help him battle a resurgent Ancient Evil that nobody believes in and, presumably, take his place once ole' Ger...er, Jeff Bridges is ready to head on to retirement. Honestly, with so few Hollywood fantasy movies based on non big-hit book series, I was thinking this could be a pretty good setup. Good plot concept, some nice lines in the trailer, 2015 special effects, etc...

Sadly the actors' abilities and the scriptwriter's poor choice of lines for those abilities made me feel like rather than watching the aforementioned plot setup in a fantasy universe, I was watching some sort of strange allegory for the actors themselves. IE, here's poor Jeff Bridges, a great actor, trying desperately to bring up his young 'nobody' protege in a world where nobody believe in making fantasy movies...wait...but we do.

And thaaaaat's  why this movie only gets 3 stars in my opinion. For a 2-hour, high-budget fantasy movie made by Hollywood, a translation of a book, a mix of new and old actors, and being a (currently) standalone film, this movie works alright. It's not the most amazing film ever, but it has some nice special effects, some nice unique monsters, and a decent plot basis. Unfortunately, those things alone are not enough to make a great movie in this day and age. This can't hold a candle to epics like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and so on. It has none of the moral depth, none of the character development, and none of the WEIGHT of those films. So, it's a popcorn flick. OK. Sometimes that's nice for a one-off action film.

Unfortunately, it's not even that, really. It struck me as I was walking out of the theater that the movie felt incredibly short. Besides the fact that I never really 'lost' myself in the movie, I realized I kept getting distracted. The movie wasn't interesting or deep enough to keep me from watching the guy checking the soccer game on his phone a few rows in front of me. That was more interesting. Sad. But why was I not interested, or why did it feel short and non-engaging? Mainly because of terrible, terrible pacing. Not long before I'd watched Dracula Untold. Like Seventh Son, DU had a few well-known actors and a few lesser known ones, was a stand-alone, was a movie translation of another story, and was a one-off action movie. But for all that, I forgot myself while watching Dracula Untold. I forgot I was in a theater, I cared about the characters, I chuckled a few times, etc. When it ended I looked at my watch and let out a deep breath, thinking ""OK, time to return to the real world"". It didn't FEEL like 2 hours. This movie did. The dialogue falls flat. The character development is nonexistent. The villain is...a villain? Besides SAYING so we don't really understand why she's so terribly evil (I mean compared to this random knight dude who says he's the hero...) until the end.

A scene that perfectly encapsulated my feeling of this movie:
Jeff Bridges' character (I can't even care enough to remember the name, haha) shows up at the protege's house. His mom seems to know Jeff. No idea why. Still didn't at the end of the film. It's that kind of ""hmm, maybe if I'd read the book I'd catch the deep subtext hinted at here, but I have NO idea what's going on"" kind of feeling. So after a few moments of glaring/making eyes at each other oddly, Jeff gets down to business and asks for the kid to come with him. He's the seventh son etc etc. So this son dude just shrugs and goes ""yeah OK. I'll go."" No emotion. His mom seems more perturbed...hmm, maybe she's going to hold him back, tell him how it's dangerous, etc...? Nope. Calls him out to the backyard to hand him some sort of talisman and delivers the one terrible line in the trailer that should have tipped me off. ""Be wise, be careful..."" Then sighs.
 Does anyone actually say that like that? Maybe I should read the book. But, in this film that kind of line was sadly common...",1435276800,,4650,4.542959427207637

At the beginning of the film, Gregor uses a magic staff as a flamethrower.  It is then treated as a normal staff for most of the movie, despite the obvious usefulness of such a weapon. 3.)Young witch uses almost no magic in scene where her life is very much in peril. 4.)Main character's necklace disappears in between scenes, supposedly because another character pickpocketed it, despite the obvious difficulty of stealing something somebody is wearing and the fact that her hands appear to be in full view for the entire scene. 5.)Most witches burst into flame automatically when killed, while others have to be burned.  6.)Two cliff-diving scenes?

6171997,3,B00HLTD6E0,"Seventh Son appeals and disappoints in equal measure. If you like your fantasy epics to be relatively clean in language, colorful in costuming and landscapes, easy to follow in plot, edited well with a decent pace of action, and without horrific displays of body parts and bloodletting...it will rank on the 3-4 positive star scale for you. On the other hand, if you are seeking a darker tale then you may discover this story too mild. If you love Jeff Bridges' acting style...you may be divided on his interpretation of the character. His brogue is very heavy...some people will see that as a nice, gritty call to the character's background while other viewers may find it difficult to understand what he is saying. The plot is basic. Whereas many parents, young teens, or fantasy-tale diehards may enjoy simple, straight-forward plots as a nice afternoon matinee escape, there are also many viewers who may see such simplicity in a movie as pedestrian and boring. I can forgive Seventh Son for being light on the character development at times (due to the length of the film and the difficulty of making a fantasy world real for consumers--a double hurdle), because the editing and pacing is sound (not easy to do for a film under 2 hours). It remains a fun movie to watch.

Too many people are expecting to see ""reality"" & when you have dragons, witches, various creatures, & magic happening that's NOT going to occur! Jeff Bridges & Ben Barnes play well off on each other. If you just need some time to suspend belief & enjoy yourself, then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It does have violence in it (battles with magical creatures & people dying).  If you are looking for something to just take you out of the ""real"" world, then this is it.",1434153600,3,545,4.45

Top (A-list level) acting, great storyline, beautiful props, sets and period wardrobes, to include stunning make-up. Even though this movie is fashionably-late! The producers justified their gross tardiness with a brutally violent movie, filled with fantasy, intrigue, awe, romance, hardcore fighting sequences, humor, blood, gore, mythological creatures and witches! All the ingredients of a very good movie indeed! This movie jumps-off right from the start; (0-60) none-stop heavy hitting action all the way through. There are no dry or boring areas in this movie, it will hold your interest. The movie even though its almost 2 hours long, goes by so fast because its just that good! It was over before it really got started and that is impressive; it leaves you wanting more. (A-list) actors (Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore) carry this movie very well and demonstrate their impressive seasoned acting abilities. Both are an unlikely pair in a movie like this, but do so in the most interesting way, that leaves your mind absolutely-blown by their great performance. Without given away too much detail, the movie is basically about a (witch hunter and his young apprentice who embark on a mission to destroy a band of evil witches) they all have the ability to change their forms to grotesque creatures!

Im sure I will be blasted for this, but what is with Bridges diction? Hes a great actor but the last four movies Ive seen him in had him slur-mumbling nearly to the point of not being understood.

I didn't expect much from the preview and this movie barely managed to live up to my expectations as low as they were. As for relations to the book series...nope, they messed up everything...literally everything! Good guys became bad guys, bad guys became good guys, important characters ceased to exist and Mr. Gregory became a useless drunk who was only barely coherent.

In this movie, the main character is mildly likeable, as is his love interest. I dare say that I find myself mostly unattached to any one of the characters. Given, however, the scarcity of worthwhile fantasy films, I raised my preferred rating by one star. My actual feeling is that it rates as ""It's okay."" The special effects mesh well with the plot, the cliches are by no means overdone. My prevailing complaint is that there is no clear detail to the plot - it's a simple ""this is that, these guys are bad even if you don't see that they all are, and my goal is to kill Mother Malkin and you are going to help me before she spreads death and destruction.""

Bridges draws justified attention as usual except I am not quite sure what he is saying most of the time. He sounds as though he has a mouth full of tobacco.  His character is kind of his medieval version of Rooster Cogburn. Moore was equally up to the task, thoroughly enjoyed her.

Just to save yourself some time fast forward until the last 20 minutes of the film because that's the only interesting part. The villains are supposed to be witches but you'd never know it by the amount of time they spend in their alternate forms, also if you're going to introduce a multitude of villains at least make em interesting and not let them be defeated in a matter of 5 minutes.

His character was abrasive, rude, mean and almost completely unlikeable.  He pulled it off quite well.  Julianne Moore put on a great performance as the evil Malkin.

So here I go.  Overall I have to admit that this movie was very entertaining and as a fan of the books I think they had plenty of potential and material to work with to make this a great movie.  Unfortunately they chose to apparently put all their budget into 2 areas and neglect the rest.  This makes for a very choppy, and in some places confusing, movie.

First of all the first half of the budget went into casting this. Superbly done, 2 stars.
Second half of budget went into CGI and fight scenes. 1 star (as any modern movie should at least have that much.

Unfortunately I could not give any more stars due to the following reasons:
Plot: Absolutely abysmal. At times there were plot leaps that left me wondering ""what?  how? Why???"" When did that happen??
Romance: Fast, choppy, and unbelievable.
Acting: Wooden and unrefined.

I miss the great movies before CGI took over everything.  At least people had to act, and romance developed at a pace where you could really identify with the relationship.",1433116800,3,1245,4.572072072072072

6173782,1,B00HLTD6E0,"Oh Boy. I wish I had checked out the media reviews BEFORE we purchased this. Would have saved us time and money.

Positives: Jeff Bridges: love him, Julianne Moore Casting: worth the Big Lebowski mini reunion, Kit Harington: John Snow fan anyone? Jason Scott Lee: ok so I didn't really realize that it was him in the movie for his fairly short cameo but it was nice to see him back on the big screen (even if I didn't know I was seeing HIM on the big screen).
Soundtrack: I only note this as a pseudo-positive because after I got through this very large, dry and stale piece of a movie, the credits rolled and the music began and I thought "" Oh! The music isn't half bad! It had emotion ( more than the movie did) and variety in its construction but alas, it too was contrived and predictable.

 Downfalls: uh...basically everything else that isn't listed under the Positives. No, really. The critics were right. Replace the Director ( not sure what happened but this guy CAN direct. maybe a 95 million dollar budget was too overwhelming to spend as it appeared to be used with little creativity); have Jeff Bridges lose his strange and garbled Don Quixotic accent. It's affected and VERY Un-Jeff Bridges. Why the heck did he agree to do this movie anyway? Does he have a new mortgage to pay or a kid going to college?? Honestly he was the ONLY reason I had to even get the film. So, another POSITIVE for Jeff Bridges. Julianne Moore: let's just leave it at that. Im not a fan. I haven't seen her Academy Award Winning performance in Still Alice so there's hope for me still to become one but I tend to cringe a tad when I watch her. Probably some weird inner issue of mine to uncover. In any case, she is highly respected in some circles and so I am also puzzled as to her choice to fill her work calendar with this bomb. Ben Barnes: I think there was a BIG technical glitch in the Casting Dept akin to the Buttle/Tuttle debacle in Brazil. Ben Barnes does not a Kit Harington make. Kit should have been on the front of that movie poster and Ben should have gone after the first 15 minutes of the movie. Game of Thrones obligations? Would he have saved this sinking ship? Well, no. probably not. Jeff Bridges should have been enough. So, lucky for Kit, perhaps HE read the writing on the wall when glancing the script? Good Show John Snow! Sorry Ben Barnes! He sure is cute. Cute but Blah. Ben Blah. Special Effects: the last time I saw dragons and demons like these was in the 1981 Harryhausen Production of Clash of the Titans. That's when I thought: ""ok, I'm being punked, is this a Red Nose Day Video?""

I could go on.

I don't recommend this movie for those that practice stringent Time Managment techniques. You will feel robbed of something more precious than money.

On the other hand, if you are at home on the weekend with nothing better to do and want to take a nice long nap....flip this sucker on. You'll be in the R.E.M stage long  enough to wake up refreshed and ready for a night on the town!",1432944000,,3008,4.370304114490161

What is lacking is a better plot structure and perhaps a few twists in the all too predictable script. I suppose this has become typical for the genre.
It is, however, a beautifully mounted film and I do not recall anything that would not be suitable for family viewing.",1432944000,,394,4.895522388059701

6174369,3,B00HLTD6E0,"Seventh son is one of those movies that you watch and say to yourself that it wasn't a bad movie yet it wasn't a great one either and instead fell somewhere in between.  The story is a familiar good versus evil tale that treads some well-worn storylines, which is part of its problem is that it is following a long list of fantasy fare and really doesnt bring anything new to the genre.  Dont get me wrong the movie is action packed and the special effects are really good but the story is predictable and the ending a bit anti-climatic considering how the story told us how unbeatable the witch was.  I also felt that the apprentice never really lived up to the seventh son reputation that the movie told.  I don't know maybe the actor was miscast in the role as I really feel he didn't fit into the role well.  Bridges was pretty good as Master Gregory but sometimes his lines felt a bit deliberate and robotic.  Moore was also good as Mother Malkin.  The movie was missing something, I just couldn't say what exactly, it just seemed like the movie didn't flow well or lack cohesiveness in addition to the unoriginal plot.  Like I said though, it is watchable and not a bad movie, just not a great one either.

6174371,4,B00HLTD6E0,"Action and Fantasy, I'm all in. I am still trying to decide why I am not giving this five stars, so let me tell you all the things I like first. The storyline is excellent and it comes with several layers. The acting was ""A"" rated from start to finish and so was the special effects. This movie has comedy, romance and action. It is a good family movie, without nudity or unacceptable language and only fantasy type violence. Matter of fact, after you see this dvd then you must watch the bonus features on how they made this film and listen to the actors speak about how much work they put into the stunts and how much they enjoyed. There are no bad points about this movie. The story alone will keep you engaged and if read any of my reviews you know I love my action, knives, arrows, swords, monsters and magic. I just figured out why I am not giving five stars, because there was no WOW factor. It was a very good movie all the way through but nothing amazed me.",1432857600,,966,4.227027027027027
6174442,3,B00HLTD6E0,"This is NOT a bad movie, but its not not a good one either. Not original at all. In fact, if you have seen Maleficent, Star Wars, Eragon, Dungeons & Dragons, Willow, Season Of The Witch, or Legend of the Seeker, then you have already seen this movie. No surprises, no special effects you haven't already seen, and a plot that follows a preset formula right out of any screenwriting textbook. Jeff Bridges play the old wise man who is the last knight of his kind who seek an apprentice to battle an evil witch. Jeff spends the entire move talking like he got chewing tobacco stuck in his lower lip. Julianne Moore plays the evil witch doing her best Maleficent impersonation. And the rest of the cast just seem to be wasted. Had the writer  of this dull fantasy deviated even a little from the predicable story-line and through in some ""Whoa I didn't see that coming"" moments, then this could have been a good movie.

My biggest issue is with Jeff Bridges (really like him as an actor). He attempted to do an odd voice during the movie and it just didn't work. It was way overdone. Totally ruined his character for me.

No real spark with the Seventh Son ...  I can't even remember his name. The actor was lackluster in the role.

The Awful:
1. The Girl - she isn't a good actress.  She tried very hard, but I never believed anything she was supposed to be feeling.  (She's very cute, though.)

The characters, like Tom and Alice are supposed to be 12 or so years old. The witch, Malkin is supposed to be old and scary.

The movie is a visual feast from start to end with fantastic CGI monsters and dragons and magic and ghosts and a four armed warrior and witches with the ability to morph into creatures, all great fun indeed, the cast is fantastic all round, Jeff Bridges is great as the old Seventh son mentor, you cant help but laugh as he is like the human equivalent of Master Yoda and a bit of Gandalf mixed in, Julianne Moore is the sexy evil queen Mother Malkin, Julianne is so good at being bad! Loved Alicia Vikander in this too, beautiful talented actress who went on to play Ava in the brilliant new sci-fi Ex Machina, this is probably one of the best fantasy movies for a while, a colourful action packed journey full of wonderful effects and just great feel good fun all round, if you love these types of movies then its really worth picking up!!

I knew going in that this was more ""inspired by"" rather than ""based on,"" but I was stunned that beyond character names and the very general idea, it bore almost no resemblance to the books. And even though they used the character names, the characters were totally different. I mean, the Spook a drunk? Hah! And the Spook doesn't know monster lore? Laughable. This movie was clearly made by those who nothing about the books, and who didn't respect the books enough to even attempt to do them justice. Shame on them!

So being thoroughly untrue to the books aside, how is the movie?

Astonishingly bad, as it turns out. Oh the effects are great, but the production looks most like Xena Warrior Princess or Hercules. In other words, cheesy. The direction is uninspired, the acting mediocre, the script horrendous. In fact the only bright spots were the effects and the actress who played Alice. She was a fresh, beautiful face, who managed to elevate the material she had to work with.

In short this was a waste of $5.99, and I hope they remake this soon... Make the remake dark, wet, dreary, atmospheric, scary as hell, and somehow keep the same actress to play Alice (I think I can forgive making the characters older).

Unfortunately the script is like an old tried and true recipe gone awry; it's nothing more than a ""me too"" film with a flimsy attempt at originality by introducing the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son mythology.
This strategy might have worked beautifully except that they do nothing with the wide range of creative possibilities inherent in the Seventh Son premise.
The spiritual components of such an illustrious and mystical lineage are approached in a very matter of fact sort of way; actually ignored, thus wasting a valuable opportunity to elaborate and expound on the legend and create a truly strong and sustainable cinematic lineage of it's own.
In more capable hands, this movie based on the Seventh Son storyline could have been a viable contender to Yoda and the Jedi Knights.

The production values and CG effects are very well done which makes for a delightful visual treat but that only goes so far.

It is so drastically different from the book series that you wonder why the author didn't just agree to have the names not used so that they could make an entirely different story, which they did.

I'll give an example... the abhuman, Tusk, is ""loyal"" to the spook in this movie. In the book, he rends enemies of the main villain in half and crushes the bones of innocents. There are several characters that were made up, including the witch's lieutenants. There are countless changes. It was the least accurate book to movie I've ever seen.

The whole love interest story line is so played out, and that for me ruined what could have been a really good movie.  Not enough action either.

Why a good movie can be just that, a good movie.

Its not deep, it does not follow the book story, is a bit cheeky and shallow.  But, its fun to watch, some beautiful scenes, nice story idea.  I enjoyed it, and really, as its just a movie, what more could I ask for.

SPOILER ALERT QUESTION

Why does he not stay with the girl, so what if she is what she is, I don't get it?  Fight the evil ones, he could take being a spook to a new level with her by his side.  Makes no sense.",1431993600,,492,3.801980198019802

The special effects were much more interesting than the story line. The characters were too flat and one dimensional, despite opportunies to explore internal conflicts and relationships. There are no subtleties in how they interact, so you feel no emotional connection to any of them. By the time you find out ""secrets"" about the different characters, you just don't care. It's all very pat and neatly tied up. Would recommend that you wait to see this when it becomes free on Prime or Netflix. Not worth the rental price.",1431907200,,644,4.863636363636363

He may be playing an old krochety character...but if you can't understand what's coming out of his mouth, what's the point?!

I realize she's supposed to be a witch that was imprisoned in a hole for a century, but a prettier face would have been a lot easier on the eyes.  To me, she just didn't have any pizzazz at all...a weak link in the movie.  A lot of interesting creatures and the effects were well done.  There were a couple times the effects looked a little cartoonish, but that's ok.  The plot is weak, and no surprises really, but I don't go into these sort of movies expecting a plot.

Still not HD but at least it was watchable in what looked very close to HD. I contacted Amazon. They called me immediately. I was put on automatic hold for the next representative. About 5 minutes in the hold cue and an Amazon representative was online. I explained my situation. I told him he might want to let someone know. I suspect the server was overloaded by large group of people trying to access the same movie. Anyway, after some awkward silences by the representative, he offered and gave me a $5 promotional certificate for my troubles. That was an appreciated fix. I hope the movie streams better now.

But I guess, following the pattern of the era, of making book series
into movie series, Seventh Son is exactly that. It is an adventure with a
really typical scenario in a world of fantasy, filled with creatures, witches,
special effects and a lot of great scenery.
But it is not anything more. The story is typical, that of the master and the
apprentice against some big evil, the action is borderline boring, the
acting is bad, and there are no clever lines or funny scenes.
Even the effort to re-incarnate the Big Lebowski in a fantasy line fails and
does not add something to the movie.

Just because I did not like it, it does not mean that fans of fantasy movies
will not. It an era with so many fantasy movies it adds nothing interesting

Instead of hiring a UK actor, which would have made too much sense, they ask Bridges to make up some kind of an accent; what we get is something that sounds like a shouting Sean Connery with cotton and marbles in his mouth. Strike 1. Next up is Julianne Moore as the Big Bad (to borrow a term from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-tvS/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy tvS</a>), a likable actress who has acting awards out the wazoo; too bad they make her into the witch from the Wizard of Oz. Strike 2. Here's from the aforementioned meeting of studio execs: ""Okay, so we already have Lord of the Rings mixed with Van Helsing and the Wizard of Oz; what should we add? I know, how about West Side Story?!?!"" Sure enough, Van Helsing's/Gandalf's apprentice (Tony in WSS) starts mingling with a witch (a friend of The Sharks rather than The Jets), although Maria (Alicia Vikander) is Swedish rather than Puerto Rican in this case. Somehow they fall in love after spending all of a few hours together. Strike 3.

The first few minutes looked promising: we see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jon-Snow/dp/B00KHWSD1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jon Snow</a>&nbsp;(Kit Harington) and Henry from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanctuary/dp/B007XF0XLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanctuary</a>&nbsp;(Ryan Robbins). Things rapidly go downhill when Julianne Moore makes her first appearance (contrary to logic), as we come to realize, with dismay, that the Big Bad is just plain goofy. Perhaps the target demographic for Seventh Son is boys aged 6 to 13? Judging by the movie poster, I assumed the target demographic was me, since I devour fantasy novels one after another and am glad to see any attempt at the genre on the silver screen. Heck, I even liked the much-maligned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeons-and-Dragons-2-Wrath-Of-The-Dragon-God/dp/B00AP4P8IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeons and Dragons 2: Wrath Of The Dragon God</a>. What went wrong in Seventh Son?

CONs
 The writing (with the exception of occasionally witty chatter from protagonist ""Master Gregory"")
 The [mis]casting (most notably, Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore)
 The book: there are so many fantasy stories published where I say to myself, ""They ought to make a movie out of this."" Not sure why The Spook's Apprentice (or ""The Last Apprentice: Revenge of the Witch"" in the US) was chosen out of the pool, but if I was going to blow ~90 million dollars, I wouldn't have picked ""The Spook's Apprentice,"" which ironically was not spooky in the least.
 All they needed at bare minimum was one good character to carry the bad ones (well written AND well executed). This character never surfaced.
 Really I could go on, but why?

PROs
 There was this one villain with four arms who could swing four swords at once, which was pretty neato.
 Oh, also: filmed in beautiful Alberta, Canada (and 3 other locations).

An evil witch (Julianne Moore) seeks revenge in a war between supernatural and humankind. The only hope of her demise lies with the Seventh Son  an inexperienced boy who soon becomes a chosen apprentice.

What did I think?

Good, not great. Theres a decent storyline and convincing CGI dragons help with special effects.
