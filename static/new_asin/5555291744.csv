205351,5,5555291744,"Panned at the time of its release, ""Bonjour Tristesse"" stands up today as one of the more stylish and less hokey 1950's treatments of teenage angst & sexuality in changing times (it's more commercial counterpart would be the saccharine ""A Summer Place"" with Sandra Dee). Shot almost entirely on location at a villa on the French Riviera, director Otto Preminger's camera often encircles it subjects, follows them straight through rooms, up stairs and around porches, until you get a panoramic sense of really being there with the characters amidst the beautiful scenery. There's a sense of perpetual movement in the camerawork that makes ""Bonjour"" worth studying for its innovative cinematography alone.

Adding to the eye-candy factor is star Jean Seberg in her second film and second collaboration with Preminger (their first being the disastrous ""Saint Joan"" of the year before). Jean caught a lot of flack from skeptics who criticized her performance as ""wooden"" and ""stilted"", bedgrudging her rapid ascent to leading-lady status after having been picked from obscurity to play Joan of Arc.  Preminger's ""search for Joan"" contest was not unlike today's ""American Idol"", with the instant success (and resentment) that its ""winners"" experience. On his TV show, Mike Wallace grilled her mercilessly about whether or not she thought she deserved to star in anything, firing accusatory statements at her like ""you are a synthetic star"", ""your debut was a failure...what are you going to do if you fail again? What will it take for you to pack up your bags and go home?""  As it happened, Jean met both Wallace's hostility and the challenges of ""Bonjour Tristesse"" with her customary good grace.

As Cecile, Jean adeptly essays a teenage girl, sweet of temperament but disporportionately enamored of her widowed father, played by David Niven. Cecile plots and schemes--with disastrous results--to eliminate Anne (Deborah Kerr) as  the competition for his affections.

Compelling by her looks alone--dimpled and aglow with youth (and a decidedly  lucky bone structure), Seberg nonetheless does more than just trade on her beauty--she carves something interesting from a character that could easily have been bland.  The duplicitous Cecile, who is not quite as benign as she seems, needs just the right amount of lurking menace--more the result of immaturity than evil, and Seberg manages the balance commendably. Her inexperience shows through in spots, but as Francois Truffaut remarked of her performance, ""when she is onscreen--and she is onscreen all the time--you can look at no one else."" She had that cinematic attribute which trumps virtuosity; she is compelling. Ironically, it is in  the easy scenes that she is weak and the histrionic ones where she shines. But she is never less than arresting, never boring, never banal. She glitters with star quality.

Co-stars David Niven and Deborah Kerr are excellent--Niven especially as the philandering but loveable father,  and Mylene Demengeot as Cecile's comic girlfriend contribute much toward making ""Tristesse"" a funny, sad, and haunting picture. The sexual and moral (or amoral) themes are ahead of their time, perhaps influenced by the French New Wave that was just gaining momentum (and which would embrace Seberg as its female mascot after the release of Godard's ""Breathless"").

If you are in doubt of ""Bonjour""'s ability to pack a dramatic wallop or 19 year-old Seberg's ability to render its message with depth and sensitivity--bear with it to the final shot, where Cecile, Macbeth-like, vainly tries to wash herself clean in a makeup mirror, her face a mask, betrayed only by the eyes filling slowly with tears of self-loathing for the damage she has wrought, until finally her pretty face cracks like a porcelain doll.",1119830400,12,3783,5.245033112582782
205352,5,5555291744,"I read the novel well over thirty years ago, in Europe, when I was fifteen, but did not get to watch the movie until tonight. I wanted to see it for a sit-down stroll through memory lane, and never expected to be touched by the story and its morale. You see, when I first read the novel, I did not care about it; I was then a fifteen-year old who was dealing with a much harsher existence than the seventeen-year old Cecile's (marvelously portrayed by Jean Seberg), who had the freedom and the money to drive her own car, to smoke, to dance, and hobnob between Paris and the French Riviera with her soft-hearted, caring, and still a child-at-heart, dad. Thus her poor little rich girl's woes, primarily consisting of keeping her dad's love to herself, was boring as well as infuriating. I realize now that I got to read the novel again to reexperience the characters in the manner originally presented by Francoise Sagan.
From the film version I watched tonight, I did not get the sense that it's >>>an accurate account of the empty, amoral, flamboyant and insensitive life in the French ""high-life"" during the late 50's/early 60's.<<<<
The core of the story is a father (debonair David Niven) and teenage daughter (beautiful imp, Jean Seberg), who lead charming lives and have the good fortune of being each other's friend and confidante. I can't recall a reference as to the manner of the mother's death (re-reading the novel ought to help in that), but neither the father nor the daughter seem to mourn her loss. However one may easily surmise that the father's affectionate and  tolerant treatment of his daughter is his way of filling the void of a mother in her life. Although a charming and prolific playboy, he always makes sure that his daughter knows she is number one in his heart, and Cecile never feels threatened by any of his short-lived paramours.

So, on that fateful summer, father and daughter land on the French Riviera for their customary fun-filled R & R. But then a dark cloud appears on Cecile's sunny skies: Anne (portrayed by Deborah Kerr), beautiful, intelligent, elegant, a successful career woman willing to leave her profession (she is a respected fashion designer) to be a perfect wife and astute stepmother; much to Cecile's chagrin her father falls for Anne's charms, pops the question and Anne answers in the affirmative. Overcome by jealousy and the fear of losing her careless butterfly lifestyle, Cecile hatches a diabolic plot to prevent their marriage from occurring. And unfortunately, she succeeds, with tragic consequences.

The morale, of course, is: don't mess with Fate! On the other hand, Cecile, having faced her darker side, builds a wall around her heart to keep herself from feeling pain and sorrow, yet as you watch the closing scene, you will understand that the wall is transparent, letting us look into Cecile's soul as she sits in front of her mirror, taking off her make-up with cream, and by now the scene has reverted to black/silver/white...tears are running down her cheeks... and, ah, tristesse.... bonjur, and bonnuit, always.

The cinematography is superb, the opening and closing scenes are various shades of gray and silver, and then as the story flashes back the French Riviera comes alive in glorious colors, Jean Seberg is just beautiful,her portrayal of Cecile deserving of respect, David Niven sophisticated in an easy-going, warm-hearted way, Deborah Kerr's Anne is perfection, and Juliette Greco, playing herself as the night club singer crooning Bonjour Tristesse in her unique style, a real treat. Be prepared to be surprised at how much you will feel touched, and enjoy.

PS: French author Francoise Sagan, had made international headlines when she was a teenager with her first novel, ""Bonjour Tristesse"". Her background was privileged, a la her heroine, Cecile's; born Francoise Quoirez to a wealthy family in Cajarc in southwestern France, Sagan - who took her pseudonym from a character in Marcel Proust's ""Remembrance of Things Past"" - was educated in private and convent schools at home and in Switzerland. She wrote ""Bonjour Tristesse"" (""Hello Sadness"") in 1953 while on a summer holiday from her studies at the Sorbonne. Sagan, then 18, completed the manuscript in just six weeks.
Interesting to note how the world has changed, since then... upon its release in 1954, Bonjour Tristesse created a furor in France. Some critics scorned it as a tale of ""passionless hedonism"" and Sagan was called immoral and was marked as symbolizing a generation of bored and blas young adults. They could not have been more wrong....",1104969600,29,4599,4.959792477302205
205353,4,5555291744,"i've seen this movie several times on TV in the past...

Oh, it's a perfecly charming movie, especially for the not TOO young amongst us, who probably remember the older times in Paris and France best. For ME: I'd buy this film because it is one of those rare moments to see Juliette Grco in action.

Grco was extremely popular in the fifties as an avantgarde singer/ actress. Those were the days of the ""existentialists"" .I've met Miss Grco personally and have been a fan of her art for years now. Where ever she's got a concert, you can hear a pin drop .....soooo different if you compare it too many concerts of todays artists. Miss Grco you could call the true follow up of that other great French singer , PIAF !

so If you get the chance to see this movie, watch Juliette Grco

in her small part and see if you're too under her spell....",1102291200,3,843,4.3164556962025316
205354,5,5555291744,"This stylish film is one of Otto Preminger's best. The French New Wave has influenced him in his opening shots, but only on a visual level. This is pure Hollywood on ever other level.  The melding of the two styles works perfectly and begins by setting  the stark mood in stunning black and white widescreen shots of 1958 Paris. The present is painted in shades of grey and silver, where Cecile portrayed by the beautiful Jean Seberg moves aimlessly thought her pointless upper crust Parisian life. Only when she encounters her father David Niven later in the evening does the past seep in on the edges of the cinemascope frame in vivid color and finally takes over moving us from the present to last summer on the Riviera. The device is used several times as we move from past to present and finally at the end of the film it creates a stunning effect once you know what suddenly happened to Cecile and her father last summer. The thing that changed everything forever and allows Preminger's camera to linger in the last frame of the film on Jean Seberg as she wipes away the make-up from her perfect face.
  David Niven is perfectly cast as Raymond the aging (...) father of Cecile. He has the cool style and humor of a man who can't commit to any woman and treats his daughter like a playmate rather than his child. His particular talents as an actor are that he seems to be playing the  ""David Niven"" character in most of his films but here in `Bonjour' as he often does in so many roles he makes a nice little twist on the ""character"". He catches you off guard to wrench his and the audiences emotions and prove once again what a good actor he is.
  At first Deborah Kerr also seems to be playing her role by rote but it is just a ruse to set us up for her fall.  As does Niven she too digs deeper in to her persona as Anne Larson and carries the film to its surprise ending.  She is a joy to watch as a film actress and here she is particularly wonderful.
  The French actress Mylene Demongeout is delightful as Elsa, Ramon's summer plaything. She is in fact `Brilliant!"" in the role.
  Geoffrey Horne is decorative and serviceable in his role as Cecile's beau who awakens her (...) .
  Jean Seberg who with her short cropped spiked hair in certain shots reminded me of Sharon Stone has that kind of blonde goddess look that Miss Stone possesses. She was only 19 when she made the film and in the hands of her director she presents us with a sensitive and spellbinding performance as Cecile.  She is at once a teenager in turmoil and a young girl on the verge of becoming a woman. This is a delicate high wire act that the young Miss Seberg executes with charm and elegance. She is festinating to watch and just right for the role.
  The subject matter is even today a little shocking and indeed this is one of the films of the 1950's that put the sin in Cinemascope. Despite the restrictions of the day or because of them filmmakers of that time were challenged in ways they are not today. Challenged to be inventive and insinuate things that we were too innocent or too naive to know happen in the world. Those filmmakers knew that the imagination is more vivid and titillating than what they might show.  It was good that the antiquated production code of the Hayes office crumbled in the 60's but with it's passing we lost a whole vocabulary in film. Here is a wonderful example of the meeting of the Movies and 50's cinematic innuendo that serves this delicate story to a tee. I think ""Bonjour Tristesse"" is `Brilliant!'",1086566400,44,3531,4.421296296296297
205355,5,5555291744,"BONJOUR TRISTESSE, like many Preminger films, is ripe for reevaluation, and this spiffy new DVD transfer may help spur on that long-overdue second look.  Seberg's performance was much-maligned in its day, but she looks smashing here and acts with considerable wit and poise; our girl's a long way from Marshalltown.  True, vocally she's perhaps not ideal, but certainly sounds as Gallic as co-stars Kerr and Niven.  The material plays with all three stars' images in fascinating ways; Seberg's ingenue is lethal, Kerr, frequently neurotic, was never presented as a creature of such moral ambiguity, and Niven's all suave facade covering inner corruption, in a performance akin to his Oscar-winning turn in SEPARATE TABLES.  Wonderful location photography, and great fun to hear the title tune keep turning up in a variety of arrangements, in best 50's-movie-theme-song tradition.  The comparison others have made on this site to the glorious Sirk melodramas is apt; the picture transcends genre in many of the same ways.  Preminger and company manage to get under your skin.",1080691200,6,1074,5.288235294117647
205356,5,5555291744,"This film has several elements that are worth noting. First, it is an accurate account of the empty, amoral, flamboyant and insensitive life in the French ""high-life"" during the late 50's/early 60's. Told in flashback, the story shows the way the central characters behave, have fun, hurt people and get to a point when ""have fun"" is just a way of forgetting.
The whole cast is excelent. David Niven is the most perfect ""late life"" bachelor who is cool about everything. Jean Seberg is absolutely beautiful as a teenager who practically lives as a woman... the chemistry of the two characters (father and daughter) is fantastic (and very puzzling). Deborah Kerr has also a great role as a sophisticated woman who doesn't get to understand the games going on between father and daughter.
The film has a beautiful cinematography. It opens in a dark black and white while all the flashback scenes are in the most fantastic colors - a perfect example how cinematography serves to enhance the character's point of view and (also) tell the story at a visual level.
The final scene is something that will stay in your memory for a long time as a great example of a great conclusion for a story that is rich and well written.
This film is a serious study of aloofness, emptyness and amorality in a way that only Hollywood could tell. It shows that money can buy off some consciences while, deep inside, some consiences cannot be bought.
A trully great cinematic experience!!!
This DVD edition has no extras (except for trailers). The image quality is first rate. So is sound quality. The opening titles (by Saul Bass, no less!) is gorgeous! The cinemascope cinematography by Georges Perinal begs to be viewd in a big screen. The music score by the great Georges Auric (""Rififi"" and ""La Bele et la Bte"") is top.",1079222400,28,1802,4.74203821656051
205357,4,5555291744,"Jean Seabourg and David Niven co-star in this stylish uncoming-of-age drama about a carefree, swinging widower and his equally irresponsible daughter, Cecile, a cynical teenage flirt who acts as the film's narrator.  They are on vacation on the French Riviera, along with Elke, an adorable, airheaded European party girl who is there as dad's date and Cecile's playmate, right up until she gets dumped in favor of a hotter prospect.  Cecile thinks the new gal will be just another one of Dad's little conquests, the ones they laugh about between chic parties and social calls, but when the new relationship turns serious, with Niven about to settle down with a mature-minded woman who may force Cecile to take her own actions seriously, the girl rebels and determines to undo the tryst.  In some ways, the plot seems somewhat simple and uneventful, although this seeming flatness is actually a reflection of the shallowness of the character's emotional lives.  Directed by Otto Preminger, this flick is packed with stylish cinematography and equally chic clothes, arch dialogue and great on-location scenery... It may not be a real classic, or a soul-moving work of art, but it is quite entertaining and very nice to watch.",1073174400,2,1223,5.069651741293533
205358,5,5555291744,"Premminger was a superb director who was greatly appreciated in his day but for some reason is relatively ignored today. Bonjour Tristesse is by far his best and most underrated film, it is a melodrama of sorts but if you're a fan of Douglas Sirk movies like Imitation of Life and Written On The wind then you will love this. Based on the novel of the same name by Francoise Sagan, (apparently regarded as the French`Catcher in the Rye') it's an intelligent and moving film about a daughter,(Seberg) jealous of her father's, (Niven) new lover, (Deborah Kerr.)
There's much more to this movie than meets the eye. A black and white present day with the past in colour, the relationship between Seberg and Niven, dubiously close and intimate, the countryside and woods in front of the house, haunting and almost surreal in their depiction. Jean Luc Goddard was apparently a huge fan, Seberg's character in Tristesse was imagined as a continuation in A Bout De Souffle. Deeply moving, intelligent and beautiful, it's an absolute classic that will grow in stature, the Premminger reappraisal begins with this movie.",1067644800,13,1110,4.9411764705882355

205378,2,5555291744,"Looking impossibly dated now, ...and very hard to sympathise with on any level.
Poor little rich girl has everything, including a very creepy relationship with her playboy Dad who cuddles her somewhat inappropriately and frequently kisses her fully on the lips! They even share a smart Paris apartment together and he walks into her bedroom without any announcement despite the door being closed.
That's David Niven, desperately trying to appear ""young"" and stud-like here but just coming across as something of a desperate and rapidly aging inconsequential old Lothario tosser.
His first name is ""Ramonde"" ...and it's used and repeated at every available opportunity and as a prefix to every sentence ever addressed to him by anybody else in the cast ...just in case we missed it.
He treats all women appallingly, with the exception of his darling daughter, and tosses them aside for his next conquest.
Enter Deborah Kerr as an older widowed acquaintance from the past and bingo, ...it's out with the current little bit of fluff and in with Ms. Kerr, who plays her usual up-tight moralistic control freak ""nun"".
She starts to come down heavily on the undisciplined behaviour of our poor little rich girl, even before she marries ""Ramonde"", so becoming the step-mother. She wants to impose her own up-tight ""morality"" on others, and is eager to reign in what will soon be her new charge.
Our precious little Princess rebels and schemes to get rid of her by re-introducing the previous much younger, (and therefore more desirable) Miss who used to be the object of ""Ramonde's"" lust before he proposed to Ms. Kerr.
Of course things get wildly out of hand, events take a tragic turn and suddenly it's ""Bonjour Tristesse"".

The cinematic conceit of having the flashbacks to happier times shot in colour, interspersed with the present ""tristesse"" shot in black-&-white may have been innovative at the time but now it's just a bit too obvious and corny.
 These are all incredibly snobbish people who look down on others less affluent and treat servants horribly as some sort of underlings to their own vapid lives.
Ms. Kerr's attitude is particularly galling. Even I wanted to slap her, so it was with something of a sense of justice that I watched her get her final comuppence .

We are then treated to what seems like interminable scenes of Little Princess's now ""meaningless"" life as she frowns and mopes while she's being taken by sports-car to smart parties, theatres, restaurants and shows by adoring suitors. (And all the time dressed in the latest Paris fashions!)
She accepts all invitations but is just not interested in life anymore....poor little pet!
She's still living with""Ramonde"" in that swank Paris appartement, ...no mention of ever having to work at all.
She has eschewed studying as being just far too boring and flunked out of all her courses, ...but then ""Ramonde"" is rich and all too willing to keep her at home.
As I said, ....creepy!
The story such as it is being short, it's padded out with warm happy scenes of life in the south of France. Over-extended dance sequences go into the street where happy peasants join in.
There is a minor love interest for Princess, (he's young, good looking and hairy-chested!), and despite the extreme disapproval of Ms. Kerr's over-bearing character and her demands that Princess ""never see him again"", there are suggestions that she did ""go-all-the-way"" with him to get his assistance in her plan to get rid of her rival for ""Ramonde's"" affections.

It's apparently OK for ""Ramonde"" to have his fleeting ""girlfriends"", but any intimations of marriage would break up the cosy little Father/Daughter affections.

It all becomes a bit moribund and you just don't engage with, or care what happens to any of the lead characters here at all.
They are all unlikeable for one reason or another and their snobbery and obvious sense of entitlement and privilege become profoundly irritating.
It may have been something of an artsy film back in its day but this one just left a sour taste for me.",1450051200,,4043,4.922287390029325

205392,5,5555291744,"""Bonjour Tristesse"" is far from a perfect film... it's hobbled by awkward mistakes.  Director Otto Preminger used an unsettling voice-over technique to reveal the character of Cecile, the wounded adolescent at the core of the movie, instead of making the scenes do the work of showing her motivations.  On top of that, the casting is kind of weird--- two veteran Brits (Niven and Kerr), one American newcomer (Seberg) in a very French story where the French parts are glossed over.

Nevertheless, the film had its major and really, its only success, in France where it was a darling of the New Wave set.  Why was that?  I think the answer may lie in the very awkwardness of the film.  The strength of ""Bonjour Tristesse"" lies mostly in its look and its style.  In a reversal of the expected, the present (in chalky black and white) is a shadow, and the past is in such gorgeous, crisp Technicolor that it almost seems to suspend time.  It's forever summer on the Riviera (especially in high definition Blu-Ray).

David Niven and Deborah Kerr are solid in their roles-- Niven as the permissive parent, Kerr as the woman ready for a life grounded in tradition.  But the film rests on Jean Seberg, as the daughter Cecile who is caught in the ""limbo"" of adolescence, and wants to keep her existence safely unchanged.  Otto Preminger makes good use of Seberg's nearly androgynous appearance, and casts her as a Puckish figure, spying on the adults and creating havoc.  Her swimsuits--all tight and revealing one piece---change in color like a chameleon skin, from red to yellow to blue and back.  There is another intriguing device--Seberg catches glimpses of her better self, her conscience, in mirrors.  It's sort of a reversal of the ""Snow Queen"" fairy tale myth.

Seberg's ""Cecile"", with her alienation and her blurred sexuality, was something new in film at the time.  If, with Preminger's help, she had been able to make the character even more elusive, manipulative, and complicated---the film might have been elevated to ""classic"" status.  As it is, it's merely a pretty film of surfaces---something that passes by like a beautiful woman, which might be why the New Wavers like Godard and Truffaut loved it.

The George Auric score is also a big plus--although the film could have done without the Juliette Greco performance of the theme song.",1438300800,3,2346,4.8813131313131315

It also retains a lot of it's original power. But to enjoy it fully, you have to take yourself back to the time when it was made, because it covered controversial ground back then. And despite what some people have said here, it is certainly not forgotten. It's easy to see why the restoration as been done, because the main themes of self absorbed youth, who will happily destroy everything and everyone to get their needs met, has exploded since then. And then, as now. they have no idea of consequences. Everyone's good, and Jean Seberg's vacuous, adolescent personality suits the main character perfectly.

205414,3,5555291744,"Bonjour Tristresse, 1958 film

The movie begins with a view of Paris. ""This is the best day of my life!"" Cecile goes for a drive in a British sports car [displaying her wealth].There is a soiree, dancing to live music. ""What a waste of time."" A song tells of sadness. She remembers last year on the Riviera. [The film changes to color.] She and her father Raymond wake up. Elsa has sunburn. There is small talk. ""Jewels or furs?"" Cecile meets a young man, a law student. He is serious and from Paris. Crickets say the same thing over and over. [Just like some people?] Anne will visit, she was a friend of Cecile's mother. We see people dancing at a club. [Note their manners.] Do clothing styles make a woman look younger? Anne hears news that upsets her! ""Occupied territory?"" Anne talks to Elsa. Do explanations create complications?

Anne stayed, the maids liked her. Everyone was nice to each other. They dance at a nightclub. [This pads out the film.] Raymond kisses Anne. In the morning they water-ski. Elsa taks about playing craps at the casino. She does, and wins a lot of money. Luck? They talk to a rich man from South America. Raymond wants Anne. ""How long would it last?"" ""Be reasonable."" Elsa's luck changed. Vanilla ice cream to cure a hangover? Is it a good idea for Anne to marry Raymond? ""That makes me so happy."" Anne finds Cecile and Philip together, she sends him away. New management? Shouldn't Cecile study for her exams? Yes, says Raymond. Spoiled, willful, and lazy? Will Cecile plot against Anne? Elsa tells of her love for Raymond. Philip wants to marry Cecile. But they must get rid of Anne. Did Cecile lie about studying? She goes to meet Philip. Later she smokes a cigarette. Anne plans changes for Raymond.

Should you drop people if you don't like them? [Probably yes.] You hear the small talk at the table. Cecile talks to Raymond about Anne. Elsa tells Cecile her plan is working. Will Cecile visit the Lombards? No. Where will Anne go? She finds Elsa and Raymond together and hears their talk! Angry, Anne drives away. Raymond is remorseful, then gets a telephone call. There was another accident! Anne's car went off the road at a curve, there were seven earlier accidents that summer. She never heard from Philip again. Elsa left for South America. Raymond is up to his old tricks again. Cecile is alone again with her memories. ""Hello sadness.""

But we know that at that age things will change again. This novel by Francoise Sagan was a best seller in the 1950s. Was it shockingly scandalous for that era? Or a warning about a too-close relationship between a father and his daughter? Is a womanizer ever a good marriage match? This movie tells about life for a certain strata of society. Is it a warning about the idle rich? [Maybe they all should have gone on the ""Jerry"" show to discuss their relationships and warn the viewers.]",1347408000,,2871,4.634577603143418

205416,5,5555291744,"Seeing this film for the first time--Near its beginning I was laughing.  Initially, ""Bonjour Tristesse"" seems dated.  Cecile (Jean Seberg), is flitting from man to man diffidently (19 year old Seberg portrays a 17 year old character, going on 37).  In Chapter 4 of this DVD, we see her facing the camera, dancing with a man, as she simultaneously narrates this scene in a bitter, hollow voice.  One has to wonder ""What is wrong with this girl?  What has made her so heartless?"" The action then shifts to the French Riviera, enticingly filmed in Technicolor; ultra-bright blues and greens--Even the olive-colored tiles in the bathroom of Cecile's bathroom are stunning.  But something's off--Superstition hangs over the sunny Mediterranean like a shroud--The number 7 having particular significance in this story.  The picture gets cooking about halfway through--Things start to unravel when Anne (Deborah Kerr), the new woman of Cecile's father, Raymond (David Niven), starts to impose her morally superior will upon amoral Cecile.  Anne forbids Cecile to see Phillippe, a law student from the neighboring villa, as he will distract Cecile from studying for the philosophy exams that she has recently flunked.  Cecile becomes furious with Anne; ""Anne is prim and prissy and a prude and a know-it-all, and I hate her!"" she exclaims while sticking needles into her doll.  Cecile sets a trap involving her boyfriend Phillippe and one of her father's ex-girlfriends; Cecile calls upon ""Jealousy the Green Eyed Monster"" to do her bidding.  The consequences of this plan end up being unexpectedly tragic, and Cecile and Raymond return to Paris, where they ""Live in Limbo"" together, going through the motions of life.  Father and Daughter end up living a lie they cannot come to terms with, either within themselves or with each other.  What makes this film work is its light, bubbly atmosphere of ""fun"" that is maintained throughout the film.  The first half of the picture could easily be seen as fluffy, contrived, pretentious.  But eventually this veneer is stripped away to reveal pain and denial of the characters--Their regret, remorse and tragedy.  Only after the film's end did I realize that this atmosphere had been created to contrast the grim reality of the subtext.  The final scene of the picture is chilling in the manner of ""The Twilight Zone"".  Additional highlights include (1) the crisp, clean, black and white cinematography of Paris; and (2) the original trailer for ""Bonjour Tristesse"", included on this DVD, that gives nothing away.

205419,3,5555291744,"I don't really understand the love and adoration for this film.  It is decent at best, but it lacks any and all real definitive originality to make it a memorable or even commendable film.  Aside from Kerr, who is remarkably moving, the acting is awkward.  Niven is serviceable but nothing to write home about (he won the Oscar this year for the better of his performances) and while I adore Seberg and consider her turn in `Breathless' to be utterly stunning, here she is as amateur as they come.

She is trying way too hard, and it shows.

The film strikes a familiar chord with a jealous daughter who works hard to disrupt the budding relationship between her father and his new beau, a woman who seems all to comfortable playing `mother'.  Cecile is a spoiled and rather outlandish young woman who would rather drink and flirt and party than study.  Her father Raymond fancies her to the point where he overlooks all of her obvious flaws, allowing her to slip away in debauchery.  When Anne, a proper and intelligent woman, enters their lives it becomes apparent that her stay is going to be too much of a positive influence on the pair and thus something MUST be done, especially when Raymond really starts to fall in love with her.

Alas, the obvious unfolds (even if the overly tragic ending is not one I expected).

What I find rather shocking is that so many tote this as an underrated gem, when in my opinion it isn't like this film really earns that pedigree.  Like I mentioned, it is fine and all, but it doesn't elevate the material or present us with anything we haven't seen done many times before.  The ambiguous relationship between Cecile and her father, with someone uncomfortable to entertain, is really the most interesting piece to the puzzle, but it is never explored with any depth or real certainty.  It is left hovering over us like an unspoken rule and so we are left wondering how astute the film COULD have been had it attempted to flesh out the realities of that relationship.

That said, Deborah Kerr is marvelously used, with the perfect pitch and tone to her performances, creating someone we can rally behind and firmly believe in.

I see where this could have been a really stunning portrait of father/daughter bonds, but instead it becomes a school-girl fantasy of love, lies and tragedy that never adds anything new or exciting to the catalog of familiar and similar films.

Oh yeah, and it's not `French' enough!",1262563200,5,2450,4.662790697674419

205431,3,5555291744,"The films of Otto Preminger share for the most part a detached objectivity in their attitudes to character and moral issues...

In ""Bonjour Tristesse,"" his gamine prot&eacute;g&eacute; Cecile (Jean Seberg) is a very peculiar girl, maybe spoiled and willful and arrogant and lazy...

Anne (Deborah Kerr) had made her look at herself for the first time in her life...And that turned her against her... And now, her father is not having fun anymore, which was probably another reason she decided to get rid of her... How carefully and how seriously she went about that decision, is the tale of Franoise Sagan, published in 1954, by the time she was nineteen...

Raymond (David Niven) is a bundle of surprises... For him, it's such a wonderful fun to have Cecile for a daughter... And loving Anne doesn't mean that he loves his daughter any less... The wealthy playboy becomes serious from the moment that Anne arrived... He could never think of her as just someone to have fun with... He does have fun with Elsa (Myl&egrave;ne Demongeot) but that's a long way from being all he wants... Now, he has never wanted any woman the way he wants Anne...

Anne spent her honeymoon by the sea 12 years ago... She had quite a debate with herself before coming down to the French Riviera... For knowing that Elsa was there, she got stupidly angry and decided to leave...Then the prospect of packing and looking for a hotel was too much after that long drive so she decided to stay...

Being too sophisticated (maybe for discovering occupied territory), Anne was as suspicious of summer as she was of Raymond in spite of the fact that she knew him 15 years ago, and was quite sure that with him, nobody is safe...

For Cecile, Anne is prim and prissy and prude... For a woman who hates vulgarities--even when they're funny--she could never be seriously interested in a man like her father... So part of her was angry, part was happy, all of her was excited... Her father had brought a girl to the seashore, made her go out in the sun and then when she was a mess of peeling, dropped her like a hot lobster... It was unfair... Yet even while she was angry at him, she was proud that he had gotten the unattainable Anne... Anne looks now softer... She moves easier... In the morning, she seems as though she had the most wonderful secret in the world...

Suddenly she becomes aware of a great responsibility towards Cecile, as it would be good if she stops seeing Philippe (Geoffrey Horne) and studies for her philosophy examination...

Cecile becomes furious at her interference... Anne wants her to study and not to see Philippe... So what shall it be? For her, there'll be a man to take care of her...And she doesn't need a diploma for that...

Now she hates Anne... For her, she has changed her father...She'll change her and will change everything...",1232928000,2,2838,4.671342685370742
205432,5,5555291744,"Juliette Greco is perfection as the aging nightclub singer at a chic Paris boite, who sings to strangers night after night of a ""street with no address.""  Irretrievably ravaged by time and perfidious love, Greco gives the part nearly everything she has; in her excellent Givenchy gown she bespeaks chic even as she allows emotion to tremble through her quack of a voice.  As she sings the haunting title track, Jean Seberg is twirling around on the dancefloor simultaneously drinking Greco in and obsessing about her own memories of a colorful, blue-splashed summer on the French Riviera, the summer in which the mystic numbers ""7"" and ""e"" combined to form a summer of death and disaster.

Preminger is superbly understated here, his direction of Seberg assured and yet improvisatory.  Some have criticized the way that Seberg, Niven, and Kerr never even try to sound like French people, and some say that the heavily accented English of the fourth lead, Mylene Demongeot, sounds like gobbledegook and makes her co-stars seem even flatter.  None of them is actually convincing, and Niven and Kerr are oddly miscast, but all of them are great in their own lights.  Kerr is believable as a dress designer, Niven sort of believable as a girl's best friend kind of dad, though neither of them seem sexy enough for their parts.  Maybe in real life David Niven was some sort of super playboy but I'm just not feeling it here.  Why didn't they just hire Jimmy Stewart if they wanted a palsy kind of older actor to be Seberg's father?  She seems like she's in love with him, or does she just feel responsible for his happiness since the mother's death?  I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and to discover that she had ""accidentally"" killed the mother, but we never get that story, maybe in the sequel?

What's great about the movie--beyond the main cast?  Saul Bass' title design has got to be among his very best: the pattern of gold coins and crosses moving along a black screen like stars in the night sky, gradually being supplanted by red hearts and blue waves, and finally resolving themselves into the famous line drawing of Juliette Greco's crying face--OMG, you will feel like you've died and woken up in France.

Geoffrey Horne as the boy next door, especially the scene where Cecile musters up all her courage and runs to his house, skips through the hallways like a thing possessed, and then pauses outside a door.  She throws open the door and you see a dimly lit room and Geoffrey Horne asleep, face down, on a single bed, the whole room lit up by the eerie, glowing white of his incredibly revealing underwear.  Va va voom, no wonder she jumps on that law student!

Also the color design of the film, how the present is in black and white, but the flashbacks in color.  The first, Juliette Greco scene,is especially impressive in this regard as Seberg, haunted by the past, is glimpsed dancing over the shoulder of her partner, until shards of color (blue) bombard her in triangles stripped into the negative (I guess) that finally overwhelm her and propel the film directly into the past,  Must be taken from those Jazz cut-outs of Matisse; this sequence is a direct ancestor of Kylie Minogue's Riviera-like videos for ""Slow"" and ""On a Night Like This.""  In fact the Kylie-Rutger Hauer relationship in the ""On a Night Like This"" clip definitely smacks of the Seberg-Niven one here in BT.  Maybe I'm overthinking this.",1222646400,,3432,4.736134453781513

205436,5,5555291744,"Some Bad Movies demand a response in the French style - every few minutes, you'll find yourself striking your hand to your forehead while shrieking, ""Alors!"" Just such a choice pastry is Otto Preminger's 1958 film version of Francoise Sagan's novel Bonjour Tristesse (which means, more or less, ""Hello, sadness""), the filmmaker's second, and final, attempt to turn Jean Seberg into a star - they'd bombed a year before with Saint Joan. Pert, perky and as American as apple pie, Seberg was perhaps the last actress who could pass for an amoral, Parisian teen temptress whose incestuous feelings for her aging roue father - she calls him, ahem, ""darling"" - spell doom for anyone he seriously gets involved with.

The beginning of this howler, set in the ""present,"" is shot--meaningfully - in black and white, the better to capture the stark ennui of Seberg's poor-little-rich-girl life. Out on the dance floor in a chic Paris boite, Seberg stares moonily into a camera and tells us in voice-over, ""I can't feel anything...it isn't the same anymore. Nothing is."" Sure, you've guessed that Seberg will also mutter, ""Will I ever be happy again as I was at the beginning of that wonderful summer on the Riviera?"" thereby cueing a flashback - shot, meaningfully, in color - but no one could anticipate that before this occurs, starlet Juliette Greco turns up to croak out the film's fall-down-funny title tune: ""The street I walk is sadness/My house has no address/The letters that I write me/ Begin 'Bonjour, tristesse.'""

Alors!

Summering sinfully in a villa with her rich daddy-o (David Niven) and his mistress-of-the-moment (Mylene Demongeot), Seberg trills dialogue like, ""Wait! Let's smell the day!"" so sunnily she seems to have traipsed in from a Gidget movie. Into this cozy triangle wanders Givenchy-clad Deborah Kerr, who, as the world's foremost fashion designer, inexplicably has marital designs on womanizing, good-for-nothing Niven. In no time, Niven's romancing Kerr (""I've never wanted any woman the way I want you""). Demongeot hits the road (""I will not be treated like a wife!"") and Seberg is forced to explain to us how she feels (""Part of me was angry, part of me was happy, all of me was excited""), since she's utterly unable to register any emotion on her blank face.

When Niven and Kerr start sleeping together, then announce they're engaged, Seberg is so jealous of Kerr - about whom she gushes, ""She looks softer, moves easier... I wish I walked the way she walks now"" - she literally jumps Geoffrey Horne, the hunky male starlet next door. Then, when Kerr reprimands her - ""You should realize such diversions can end up in a hospital!"" - Seberg goes bonkers at the notion of losing Niven and gaining a stepmother-cum-truant officer, and begins to plan Kerr's heave-ho. After sticking voodoo pins into her doll, Seberg tells us, on the soundtrack, ""I actually spent days comparing the contestants for my father,"" while she chalks up a blackboard comparison of herself and Kerr in such categories as ""Fun,"" ""Chic,"" ""Possessiveness"" and ""Flirting."" (Tellingly, Seberg doesn't put ""Acting"" on the board.) Just in case we think she doesn't deserve to get dumped, Kerr suddenly gets prissy, denouncing Niven's alcoholic pals: ""In the end, their only memories will be of hangovers!"" Then, Seberg seduces Horne into feigning a romance with Demongeot, which - oh, don't ask - provokes Kerr into driving off a cliff into the sea.

Alors!

Back in the black-and-white ""present,"" Seberg confides that she and Niven ""have an unspoken agreement to never mention last summer"" -- the very deal, we'd guess, they cut after finishing this film.",1186704000,4,3647,5.00990099009901
205437,4,5555291744,"BONJOUR TRISTESSE (1958), based on the infamous bestseller by teenager Francoise Sagan, captures the early trends of French new-wave cinema.  Even today, this film still holds up beautifully thanks to it's progressive themes and top-flight performances.

The story is told in flashback.  Cecile (Jean Seberg) and her widower father Raymond (David Niven) spend their summers in idyllic bliss on the sun-soaked French Riviera.  Their relationship is open; Cecile can trust her father to allow her all the freedom she wishes to enjoy the opposite sex, and vice-versa.  All that changes when Cecile's stern godmother Anne (Deborah Kerr) arrives to spend the holidays.  Anne wants Cecile to start seriously preparing for her future, Cecile would rather run wild with her latest boyfriend Philippe (Geoffrey Horne).  When Raymond announces his plans to marry Anne, Cecile sets into motion a plan that will trigger untold tragedy for them all...

Francoise Sagan's semi-autobiographical book was always going to be an ideal film, and producer/director Otto Preminger's 1958 movie still hits the right mark.  The lives of the moneyed (and mindless) on the Riviera coast, their nasty manipulations, and what happens when a woman tries to change the destructive relationship between a father and daughter, is truly fascinating.

The cast is sensational.  Jean Seberg, with her unique combination of willowy European grace and all-American charm, is the ideal choice for Cecile.  Deborah Kerr's performance as Anne walks the fine line between comedy and drama; and David Niven's performance as Raymond is equally fine (Kerr and Niven had co-starred in ""Separate Tables"" the same year).

The supporting cast is very strong too.  Mylene Demongeot steals many a scene as the feather-brained Elsa, Martita Hunt has an all-too-brief bit as Philippe's mother; the cast also features Walter Chiari, Juliette Greco (as the nightclub singer who performs the Title Song), and Roland Culver.

BONJOUR TRISTESSE is a fabulous film, from it's moody B&W sections to it's sombre ending.  Especially for fans of the tragic Jean Seberg (one of the many casualties of the Hollywood machine), this film will be a must-see.
