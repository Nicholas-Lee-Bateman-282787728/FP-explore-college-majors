964617,3,6305067155,"In 1965, Monte Hellman and Jack Nicholson took $150,000 dollars out into the Utah desert and came back with two films, 'The Shooting' and 'Ride in the Whirlwind'.  Given that both films were shot back to back, I would have assumed that they would be similar, at least in style if not theme, as Hellman directed and Nicholson had large parts in both, but instead I found them to be very different.  So different, that had I not known better, I would thought they'd come from two completely different eras - 'The Shooting' from the nihilistic early 70's and 'Whirlwind' in the lingering last days of the cowboy 50's.

At least at the beginning.  'Whirlwind' looks almost like a cheap John Ford knockoff as it starts out, with Harry Dean Stanton turning in an early Harry Dean Stanton -esque character named Blind Dick who's gang robs a stagecoach and kills one of the guards.  After the robbery, the outlaws head for their hideout, and the survivors on the stagecoach head into town and get a vigilante posse together.

Into this mess ride three cowhands headed to Waco.  They inadvertantly stumble onto the hideout, and Blind Dick, realizing they are just passing through, lets them bed down outside the hideout shack.  In the morning, both parties find themselves surrounded by the vigilante posse, and there's no time for explanations, or sorting out who's who.  The posse takes it for granted that everyone's a member of the gang, and the cowhands realize no one would believe them now anyway.  Two of them are able to break out and head out on foot in the mountains, pursued by the posse.

Despite their innocence, both of the remaining cowhands are slowly forced to become exactly what the vigilante's think they are as they try to make their escape.  By the movie's end, it doesn't seem as much a John Ford western anymore as it does something out of the French New Wave (with spurs).

Maybe I shouldn't be surprised that it was Jack Nicholson's script - but after watching, I am anyway.  This is a very intelligent movie, and one that doesn't feel the need to beat the viewer on the head by over-stating plot points or emphasizing the obvious.  The actors are allowed to advance the story by their actions and by some very spare but effective dialogue - and the movie speaks for itself.

Whereas 'The Shooting' could come across as garbled or difficult, 'Whirlwind' is a much easier picture to follow along with.  Fans of the western will be satisfied, and those who may not normally seek out that particular genre will, I think, also find a very thought provoking picture.  The main drawback to this film is the production and film quality, which reflect the sacrifices that a $75,000 budget requires.  Personally, I think it was incredible what they accomplished with such limited budgets, but there are some who, I'm sure, will be put off by the cheap look of the film.

I enjoyed both of these films, but I'll give the edge to 'Whirlwind' only because it's intelligent and more accessible than 'The Shooting'.  The real shame is that at this time, both these discs are discontinued, and the cost on the second-hand market is pretty severe.  Pick them up if you find them cheap, or else rent them, but either way, I'd suggest getting them both at the same time.  Together, they make up a unique filmmaking chapter, one that's been ignored too long.",1238803200,,3357,4.691126279863481
964618,4,6305067155,"The Shooting, a different breed of western directed by Monte Hellman shot in 1966 with an all-star supporting cast, Jack Nicholson, Warren Oates, Millie Perkins. The story is about a strange murder that occurs, whereafter Millie Perkins hires Warren Oates to help track down the killer. Jack Nicholson, also a hired gun Perkins hires on, but little do they know there may be a flip side to the coin. The Shooting on this Catcom 2002 release is presented in the rare 16x9 widescreen. Ride In The Whirlwind, also filmed in 1966 before The Shooting, director Monte Hellman wanted to take advantage of the location and terrain, plus already having all the available actors around and all aboard. Ride In The Whirlwind, presented in full screen was written by Jack Nicholson, Nicholson carefully researched the Library for the true to life western frontier for the screenplay of this film. Jack Nicholson starring, with Cameron Mitchell, Harry Dean Stanton, and Millie Perkins. As far as this dvd is concerned, I'm not sure what the hype is, yes, they are early Jack Nicholson, yes, they are probably out of print, so what. I've seen sellers on Amazon trying to sell this used anywhere from 300 to 700 dollars. What's the deal? Please don't say ""Day Of Anger"" started this bull_ _ _ _.

964619,5,6305067155,"Monte Hellman's RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND almost always suffers from comparisons to its better-known companion film, THE SHOOTING.  Both were shot over the same 35-day period in the Utah desert, both were produced for Roger Corman, both star Jack Nicholson (RIDE boasts a writing credit as well), and over the years both have become cult classics.  But while THE SHOOTING takes the high road into arthouse existentialism -- it's what might have happened if Samuel Beckett had written a Western -- RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND is more conventional Western fare.

Nicholson's script, with its deep feeling for character and place, is one of the finest ever written for a Western, and Hellman's direction brings it to the screen with a minimum of fuss or adornment.  The basic plot -- in which three cowboys are caught in the crossfire between a gang of bandits and a gang of vigilantes -- takes several shocking turns, and the film proves that Sam Peckinpah wasn't the only Western director working at peak form in the late '60s.

RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND has plenty to offer Western buffs and casual viewers alike.  It deserves rediscovery.

The DVD edition from VCI features adequate if grainy widescreen video, a clear though unexceptional audio transfer, a roundtable commentary, previews of other Monte Hellman films, and an enthusiastic still-frame essay from Quentin Tarantino.",1212278400,3,1368,5.080357142857143
964620,4,6305067155,"Jack Nicholson wrote the screenplay for this little gem, and in the dialogue he captures the flavor of life at that time perfectly.  While too much time is spent on the shootout in the first half of the film, the second half more than makes up for that, as Jack and Cameron Mitchell--two cowpokes unlucky enough to be too close to an outlaw gang--hole up in a sodbuster's cabin.
The sodbuster, an old guy, lives with his wife and daughter, played by Millie Perkins, and as Jack says about her, ""You don't talk much.""  True.  In fact, nobody does in this film, but that's just fine.  Because it's the atmosphere that counts here, and Monte Hellman, the director, gets that just right.  I found Hellman's The Shooting somewhat pretentious and the ending was just plain weird.  But Ride in the Whirlwind is the kind of Western that resonates a lot more--it FEELS like you're there; it feels like you can talk to these people.  They won't say much, but what they will say counts for a lot.
Nicholson is fine as Wes and Cameron Mitchell equally strong as his partner Vern.  As Blind Dick, leader of the small outlaw gang, Harry Dean Stanton puts in another of his strong, straight-ahead performances.  The shootout is between the outlaw gang and a vigilante posse that's out to get the gang after the latter have held up a stagecoach.
One thing that makes this Western so strong is the small, dusty, lonesome life that all the main characters lead.  The sodbuster and his family live in a cabin in the middle of nowhere.  The cowpokes ride together, but they're removed from anyone else.  The outlaw gang similarly hangs out in an isolated shack, and the vigilate posse, all men, ride wherever they think there's outlaws; one of them, seeing Abigail for the first time (Millie Perkins) mentions to his partner that she's a ""cute piece"" and that he'll be coming back to have a meal.
This lonesomeness is what pervades Ride in the Whirlwind and what makes it so compelling.  It's a short (82 minutes) film, but well worth watching, if not owning.",1017532800,7,2039,4.6305555555555555
964621,3,6305067155,"In the spring of 1965, Roger Corman, the king of profitable, low budget movies, helped produce (without credit) two amazing films that have achieved legendary cult status.  Now, thanks to VCI Home Video, Monte Hellman's ""THE SHOOTING"" and ""RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND"" are available on DVD in pristine, widescreen transfers.  The films should be seen together. They are subtly connected in many ways.  Perhaps even insubtext and theme.
Both films star a then unknown Jack Nicholson and super starlet Millie Perkins and were shot simultaneously on location in Utah for the modest amount of $150,000.  Nicholson also wrote and co-produced ""Ride in the Whirlwind."" It is the straightforward tale  of the making of a bad man and features on target performances from Cameron Mitchell, Harry Dean Stanton, Rupert Crosse and Katherine Squire among others. After accidentally happening on a group of outlaws, and getting caught in the crossfire by a sheriff and his posse, Wes (Jack Nicholson) is mistaken for one of the gang and escapes.  But, in order to defend himself during his flight, has to start killing.  By the end of the film he has become a legendary and mythic figure.  Quentin Tarantino, a big fan of Hellman, has called this ""one of the greatest films ever made.""
In the The Shooting, former bounty hunter turned miner Gashade (Warren Oates) returns to his diggings to find one of his partners, Leland, dead, his brother Coigne gone, and his third partner, Coley (Will Hutchins) holed-up in a nearby cave. Soon, a mysterious woman (Millie Perkins) materializes out of nowhere and offers Gashade a huge sum of money to guide her on a journey he soon realizes is a manhunt.
The quirky screenplay is by Adrien Joyce, the odd pen-name of the brilliant screenwriter Carole Eastman who wrote the acclaimed ""Five Easy Pieces"" which also stars Nicholson.
What ""The Shooting"" is actually about is anybody's guess.  It has been called an existential western, or anti western.  The super low-budget enforced a minimalist, almost surrealistic style that is terrific and timeless.  The stark outdoor locations add immensely to the mood and of this this strange, enigmatic story that seems to reflect mid 60's paranoia and disillusionment.
Since their initial release, both films, though seldom seen, have become critical favorites, and have attained cult film status here and in Europe. Both discs include an entertaining and revealing commentary by director Monte Hellman and actor Millie Perkins with additional informed commentary by American Cinematheque programmer Dennis Bartok.",1009929600,4,2572,5.188405797101449

964623,4,6305067155,"This western has been called existential, a term liberally used in film reviewing, and I'm not sure I know the correct usage of the word. But I  like this film a lot. Made by a colourfull man named Monte Hellman who  hasn't made a lot of films, this is one of his most unusual. Made in 1967,  back to back with another film, The Shooting (also worth checking out),  Jack Nicholson, Tom Filer & Cameron Mitchell, are being pursued by a  posse who have mistaken them for thieves. Hellman's film are often about  characters who are aimless, well, maybe not aimless, but they end up going  nowhere, and this is no exception, as they climb a hill/mountain that goes  up and up....one of the characters remarks ""Shame to do all of this  walking for nuthin'"". Damn straight. They discover a cabin, where a  grown daughter (Millie Perkins) and her mother suffer in servitude to the  old man. Odd things happen. The film is wonderfully odd, minimilist (not by  choice), it was made on a low budget, but the minimilism adds to the often  unsettling atmosphere. Film is full of great dialogue, such as ""It's  peculiar to sit here playing chequers while a bunch of men want to string  us up"" Wes replies ""Why don't you put a tune to it?"".

In the morning, they find themselves surrounded by a vigilante hanging party and are forced to become fugitives because of mistaken identity. I felt their attempts to get away from the vigilantes could have been better written, no attempts to distance themselves were made and it wasn't very realistic to me. Another unrealistic part was towards the end when Jack Nicholson and Cameron Mitchell were sitting in the home of family on top of the mountain and wasted time just sitting around talking. They should have taken the horses and gotten out of there ASAP.

There was no television or radio, so people with little education passed their free time playing checkers or drinking or just sitting and pondering the natural world around them.

(6.5) Ride in the Whirlwind (1965) - Cameron Mitchell/Millie Perkins/Jack Nicholson/Harry Dean Stanton/Katherine Squire/George Mitchell/Rupert Crosse",1360368000,,920,5.375
964876,5,6305067155,"Ride in the Whirlwind- A very good western that had the extreme disadvantage to be packaged with the shooting. A very good performance from Nicholson as a man at the end of his rope due to a series of unfortunate circumstances that come to bear on him. You feel for him and the unfortunate circumstances that have befallen him and his pard'. A good film and really cool performances from the actors.
  The Shooting- This film was absolutely astounding and while Ride in the Whirlwind was better than good,it plaed compared to this. Warren Oates turned an awesome performance but that is to be expected from Oates, a truly awesome actor who does not get the respect he deserves. His role begins with him returning to camp to find that his brother has been killed after questioning their family friend as to the circumstances, he begins to smell a rat. Post rat scenting, the two are met with by Millie Perkins who seeks their services to get her to a specific location whilst winning over the family friend and estranging the Oates. Oates takes the job and brings the family friend with them. Millie Perkins Begins to throw encumberances on their travels and  not just foolish feminine follies but potentially dangerous situations through her caprices. It soon becomes truly apparent that she is in control of this whole situation. This already volatile situation gets a great catalyst in the appearance of Jack Nicholson. She insists that he ride along and Oates further realizes that something is rotten. It begs the question of why not get out? The answer being there is no out for Oates or the family friend. They travel further and further into the desert. The landscape sets a great tone for the all or nothing ending that is coming. I've said too much and loved every minute of it. I have left out a couple of scenes but definitely watch for the loss of the horse, Nicholsons lack of a friend, and Oates rage at Jack, and finally check out the final scene.
  This movie is insanely awesome, the dialogue is crisp and snappy, the performances are great across the board. Nicholson sizzles as the deadly dandy. Oates is brilliant as the put-upon loyal brother. Millie Perkins may actually take the cake when you bounce it off the character that she played in Ride in the Whirlwind. I love the contrast that exists between the two and it is true credit to her that she brings some serious weight to this ensemble cast. I must state that once again The Shooting takes the cake but Ride in the Whirlwind does have merit and was enjoyable. The dvd also contained the previously mentioned oldies commercials that were really fun to see. You could definitely see this dvd on Quentin Tarrantino's shelf.

964877,5,6305067155,"the two movies themselves - what I could see of them in this low res (bootleg looking), vital scene skipping dvd I paid good money for - were ahead of their times, existential westerns with Jack playing two polar opposite characters - a slick, psychotic gunslinger in The Shooting and an everyman cowpoke caught up in a desperate situation brought on by pure chance in Ride in the Whirlwind. the dialogue in both felt like it was pulled directly from a time machine recording, complete with accurate inflections delivered by the talented cast including Warren Oates, one of the best character actors of all time. even Will Hutchins (from the saccharine 60's ""Sugarfoot"" series) turned in a very credible performance as Oates' cowardly doofus sidekick in The Shooting. the movies share a common theme of men caught up by obdurate fate trying to puzzle out a survival strategy in response to it. the period details, quality scripting and plot, and early peeks into Jack Nicholson's acting potential make me really wish that these movies would finally get the theatrical release they should have gotten originally, especially The Shooting!",1288656000,4,1136,5.047872340425532
964878,5,6305067155,"Several years ago European avant-garde composer Pierre Boulez dismissed the cranky, experimental music of American composer Charles ""take your dissonance like a man"" Ives as ""having come from an insurance salesman."" By contrast, Boulez' own music is tinkly Euro-avant, a musical tradition that was given freedom towards academic experimentation by old money. Not a single Boulez work can get under the skin like Ives' ""Gong on the hook and ladder"" or ""Symphony 4.""

American horror has long had a fitful relationship with the American avant-garde; it has also been more genuinely disturbing than anything Europe has produced. Kentucky born Tod Browning produced jagged, feverish dreams while Brit James Whale produced well-crafted, sophisticated, and witty fairy tales. There is something far more unsettling in Lon Chaney painfully looping fishing wire around his eyeballs, or Lon Jr. ""accidentally"" strangling an extra, than there is in Boris Karloff's passion for cricket. An avant-garde filmmaker even approached the infamous ""naive surrealist"" Ed Wood, hoping for a collaboration, but by then Wood was too drained and too ravaged by rejection to respond.

So, it seems only apt that B-horror maestro Roger Corman financed Monte Hellman's sojourn into a western Oz. Hellman's The Shooting (1967) could be a disturbed and disturbing younger sibling to Maya Deren`s At Land (1944).  Carole Eastman's Sarte/Camus-like screenplay is wistfully organic and, simultaneously, startling in its unflinching, unromantic bleak minimalism, assisted greatly by Gregory Sandor's desolate camera work.

The Shooting begins where Anthony Mann left off and may well be the defining subversive post-Mann western.  Former bounty hunter and miner Willet Gashade (Warren Oates) returns to camp only to find his twin brother, Coin (also Oates) missing and his partner, Leland, shot dead by an unseen sniper.  Left in the camp is the hysterical Coley (Will Hutchins) who relates to Willet that he overheard an argument between Leland and Coin.  Coin had ""ridden down a man and a little person, maybe a child.""  Coley, who is child-like and slow-witted, tells Willet this several times in a broken, cryptic delivery.  Shortly after the argument, Coin rode off and Leland was mysteriously shot dead while brewing coffee.  Willet now is determined to track down Leland's anonymous murderer.  Before Willet can depart, however, an unnamed Woman (Millie Perkins) walks into camp.  She has no horse, explaining that she had to shoot it when it broke its leg.  We're first introduced to Woman through a symbolic, fragmentary shot of her gloved hand, which is gently caressing a white horse, before she shoots it.

Woman asks Willet to escort her to the far away town of Kingsley, which can only be reached after crossing a dangerous desert.  Willet and Coley agree to be her guides.  Willett has a vague, ulterior motive to accompany Woman, telling Coley ""I have my own reasons,"" without offering up what those reasons are.  Woman too has her unstated reasons for the journey ahead.  When Willet discovers that Woman's horse had no broken bones, he asks her ""Why did you shoot this animal?""  After an elongated silence, Woman responds only with a smile.  Their destination becomes increasingly oblique when Woman insists on taking the wrong direction.

Coley follows Woman like a little boy following his first crush.  Willet mistrusts Woman and is aloof towards her.  Willet is concerned with and frightened about their destination, but this is not a journey he can abandon, regardless of the outcome.

Woman is the eye of this storm.  Is she sociopathic?  Eventually, it seems that revenge is her goal, but is it revenge for the murder of Leland?  Is it revenge for the murder of the ""run-down man and little person, possibly a child""?

Halfway through the journey, the three are joined by a deadly gunfighter named Billy Spears (Jack Nicholson).  The relationship between Spears and Woman is never clear.  Woman envies Billy, but are they siblings?  Lovers?  Billy and Woman even dress alike and Willet is shaken to the core, enough to ask Billy her name.  ""I don't see no point in it,"" Billy replies.

Enigmas abound: a child's game and candy shared with a dying stranger lying under an umbrella in the middle of the desert, tension, threats, desertion, a murder, the loss of horses, the crushed hand of a gunfighter staggering aimlessly in the desert and a sharp, final confrontation that plunges the viewer into dizzying, surrealist questions.  Hellman has stated that The Shooting is an allegorical reaction to the deaths of both John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald and the lack of answers to those deaths.

Regardless, The Shooting is a brilliantly dysfunctional work that transcends any period.  This is a powerhouse of underground filmmaking which makes one lament Hellman's lack of recognition.

Neither Sergio Leone nor Sam Peckinpah would touch it.

7882847,4,6305067155,"Released in 1966 and directed by Monte Hellman from Jack Nicholsons script, Ride in the Whirlwind is about three traveling cowhands (Nicholson, Cameron Mitchell & Tom Filer) who are wrongly targeted by vigilantes out to apprehend a gang of murdering robbers. Cutie Millie Perkins has a peripheral role.

The best thing about this barebones independent Western is its mundane realism where it comes across as a docudrama. While its slow and sometimes dull, the subtext concerning vengeance and mistaken indictment is interesting. When the three protagonists come across a body hanging from a tree at the beginning its a grim omen of things to come. Nicholson had a great grasp on lifelike Old West discourse. Ride in the Whirlwind is pretty much on par with its more surrealistic sister film The Shooting, which was shot immediately after this one and at the same general locations.

The film runs 82 minutes and was shot in Kanab & Paria, Utah.

I am not old enough to have known men of this era but I am 70yo and did hard labor jobs most of my life away, far away from the city and I feel that Nicholson's script does a great job of catching the conversation of the old style manly men who learned early to keep their mouths shut and get the job at hand done. Remember, all  these guys had to look forward to, at best, was another hard long day in the saddle and bed down in the open, preferably near a well or a spring until they got to the ranch where they were headed.  I liked it pretty well and got into the story.",1492646400,,1021,4.115577889447236

This offbeat western is a wonderful find. I've gone a whole career taking in westerns, and its so much fun to stumble on one never seen. What sets this western apart for me is the pacing. The director took the time to let us get familiar with the characters.. and the terrain. The film contains frequent gaps without a trace of dialog. The eerie soundtrack enhances the mood, informing us this is a different kind of film.

The acting is superb. Jack and Cameron simply become their characters. And Millie Perkins. Fabulous performance. She's the unhappy teenager, stuck in a world she has learned to tolerate by simply haven fallen into compliance. But never surrender. She gives in neither to her father nor to the strangers. She's sultry, slightly impudent, and oh so sexy. In the first 10 seconds on the screen you know all about her.",1491523200,,1043,4.82122905027933
