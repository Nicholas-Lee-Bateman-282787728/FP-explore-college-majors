2974536,5,B000WH5AWO,"This is a killer workout!  I loved it.  I usually workout twice a day, so I figured I could handle all the advanced moves the first time around.  Oh, man!  I was quivering by the end of the workout - and I was thrilled!  I knew this was a tool I could use for a long time to come.  I've done fitness tapes/dvds for the past 15 years and I've bought my share of clunkers.  Either the workout got boring or the instructor got annoying.  Not here!  Erin gives you many ways to change up your workouts (which is a huge bonus) and she's very likeable, fun and motivating.  Even better, she's smart and challenging.  I enjoy and appreciate the fact that she educates you while you're working out, ie; what muscle groups you're working, etc.  Erin's a great trainer.  I've purchased her earlier dvds (she's a pre/postnatal specialist) and I loved them, too.  I still incorporate them into my rotation, that's how good they are.  I always learn something new.  If you're looking for a challenge, no matter what your ""condition"", Erin's the trainer for you.  Strong Body, Ageless Body rocks!",1199750400,71,1082,4.552083333333333
2974537,5,B000WH5AWO,"Speaking as someone who would rather workout on a treadmill for an hour than do five minutes of weight training, this DVD is a total life saver. I'm a cardio junky, but I know I need to build in weight training so I keep trying new workouts to see if anything will get me to do the work. Until discovering Erin's DVD, I couldn't find anything that I wanted to finish, let alone incorporate into my regular rotation.

Now I'm doing this workout at least twice a week to supplement my cardio routine. It's a motivating, fast-paced series of exercises that switch between upper and lower body sets. The transitions are easy to follow but quick so your heart rate stays elevated and you're done before you know it. The program ends with a nice floor work section that incorporates inner/outer thigh work and abs/pilates exercises. Erin is very easy to follow and motivational. The program also includes a helpful corner graphic that shows you advanced options for every exercise.

This is one I'll go to again and again.",1199664000,83,1016,4.670391061452514
2974538,5,B000WH5AWO,"Erin O'Brien is definitely one of my favorite instructors--likeable but tough. She's down-to-earth like a good friend, and, like a good friend, she won't let you quit! This is a no-nonsense workout requiring only weights and wherewithal. Highly recommended.",1199664000,27,257,5.615384615384615
2974539,5,B000WH5AWO,"The thing I like best about this program is that it's so ""do-able"" but later -- oh, boy, do you feel the work you've done.  I've got a lot of upper body strength, but my lower half is a little out of shape and flabby.  If what my thighs are telling me is true, then this should do the trick!

I also love how she tells you exactly why you're doing what you're doing and what the long term benefits are.  Sure, I can tell I'm going to get a better looking body, but it's also awesome to know that I'm helping to prevent osteoporosis, strengthening my connective tissue and raising my metabolism.  At 37, that stuff is starting to matter to me as much as how I look!",1199664000,27,664,4.116279069767442
2974540,5,B000WH5AWO,"A SOLID great workout!!  Erin is a wonderful teacher and an excellent motivator.  She takes strength training and makes it exciting and challenging.  This is a great program to grow with, you can start with light weights then gradually build up to heavier ones.  This DVD will definitely be a permanent fixture in my weekly rotation.",1199664000,22,333,4.892857142857143
2974541,5,B000WH5AWO,"I bought this on a whim actually.  I didn't know of the instructor Erin O'Brien, but wanted a new workout.  I ended up picking a great dvd here.  It's toning done standing and done on the floor and it works out almost every muscle in your body.
Erin is a great instructor.  She explains everything so well by telling you why you are doing what you're doing.  She cues well and so you always know what's coming up.  You can do the basic move that's demonstrated, or the tougher variations which is shown in a separate square in the corner of the screen.  That's a great feature in itself so you can progress easily and move up when you're ready.  All you need is some weights and you're ready to go.  Even though she's not totally well known, I highly recommend this workout to everyone because almost anyone can follow it, and it will compliment any of your cardio workouts you might already own.",1199059200,157,896,4.414634146341464
2974572,5,B000WH5AWO,Great workout for beginners!  It features more advanced exercises as you grow more comfortable with the original workout.  Very easy to follow and challenging!,1489363200,,159,5.583333333333333
2974573,5,B000WH5AWO,"I absolutely love this exercise DVD. Erin is a great motivator. It seems just as I am ready to quit she says something encouraging. I love her reminders to tuck my tummy, or watch my back, etc. It feels personal! I always feel energized when I am through.",1488153600,,255,4.333333333333333
2974574,4,B000WH5AWO,"I like Erin's style of motivation...more encouragement. I wanted a basic full body workout, that wasn't loud, to do in the morning. This works for me. My only ""complaints"" are that she gets to talking and the reps are not always equal for each side (not much of a complaint) and I am quirky about that, and the stretching at the end is not long enough for me. Easy to adjust the workout though. VERY happy with it!!",1486080000,,415,4.333333333333333
2974575,4,B000WH5AWO,"Certainly good for those who are older but in decent shape......she does explain why you do some of the exercises which is good....

2974597,5,B000WH5AWO,I am 48 and not in great shape.  This was perfect for me.  I didn't do all the hard stuff pictured above her.  But it was still a nice all over work out.,1459814400,,153,3.5757575757575757
2974598,5,B000WH5AWO,Very good pace. I am starting my third week of doing this workout every morning. Erin is very easy to listen to.,1458172800,,112,4.136363636363637
2974599,5,B000WH5AWO,"I have Erin O'Brien's Strong Body, Fit Body, which is an excellent workout but very challenging. I really like Erin's encouraging and informative style, but find I can only tackle SB,FB when I've got lots of energy and willpower. I bought this one because it was, accurately, described as a step down. It doesn't take quite as much gumption for me to get started, but it's still a very satisfying workout. For anyone looking for more intensity, the box in the right corner shows her doing those variations.

It is slightly old school, with squats aplenty, and traditional high rep arm movements like bicep curls and chest flies. Erin adds some extra flavor, though, and I especially appreciate the care she takes to explain good form. It is mildly but not substantially aerobic, and all the major body parts get their turn. I really felt it in my glutes and pecs the next day.",1457568000,,876,4.688311688311688
2974600,5,B000WH5AWO,"Love this workout!  My bone density test over the past 4 years have not been good.  My goal is to do this work out 3-4 times a week for 2 years and see if the bone density improves or at least maintains the same :)... I'm on week 8 right now!
I am 56 years old and this workout is perfect... I am slowly adding the harder movements and hope to increase my hand weights from 3 to 5 pounds.",1456876800,,388,3.8375
2974601,5,B000WH5AWO,"I've been through multiple injuries and a diagnosis at one point in time that specified max weight limit of  5 lbs for life. This video is something I can do without hurting myself, with or without weights. The floor work at the end is challenging and finally works my hips and lower abdominal area in a way that doesn't give me pain later. Go slow, breathe through it, and have fun.

Pushing yourself to pain with exercise or rapid breathing only means going backwards ... at least for me. I've slowly and steadily gained muscle and ability to lift heavier weight without injury. With videos like those from Gilad and Erin O'Brien, I can lift 50 lbs and carry it a good distance without pain. My hip doesn't flare up anymore so that it limits my leg's range of motion by 20% or more.

Sitting around doing nothing would've guaranteed a 5 lb weight limit for life. I've had to walk without weights, do workouts without weights while they were using 5 lbs or 10 lbs. When they're doing 20 reps, I might do 5 in the same amount of time. I can't go as fast as the people in the workouts. And that's okay. Every little bit helps. Know your limits.

This workout has a little video that pops up in the corner with variations on workouts. So if you're bored with one exercise or it's too easy, you can try a harder variation.

I love what it's done to my hip strength. I used to do lunges and feel pain every time. Now I can actually do them, but I can't go all the way down yet. I got to help my parents move all kind of boxes for a move. The weights, the workout videos, the trial and error in learning limits, building up and going past them ... all worth it.

If something hurts, don't do it. Pain won't lead to progress. Anyway, each body is unique. Find what works for you. This video definitely works for me and I like it a lot.",1453248000,5,1829,4.241379310344827

2974614,5,B000WH5AWO,"I absolutely love this workout! It's a total body workout and it's not easy or hard. But you know you had a great workout when you're done. I love the floor workouts portion in that when it was over, I was sad it was over. During the upper body workout, there's a window that shows you a more difficult alternative, and this is great option to have. Erin explains which muscle each move is working on. She also makes sure you are reminded of the correct posture when doing each move. I know everyone is different, but I love Erin's style and I'm planning to get Strong Body, Fit Body, which I read is harder than this one. Thank you, Erin, for a great workout!",1443916800,,660,4.288
2974615,5,B000WH5AWO,I found this DVD in the public library. I was checking it out so often that I decided to save $$ in gas and buy it. Very worth it.,1441670400,,130,3.5172413793103448
2974616,5,B000WH5AWO,very good. But a bit intense,1440374400,,28,3.8333333333333335

2974652,5,B000WH5AWO,"I did this workout this morning and let me tell you I was sweating! Erin has you moving through each exercise swiftly. I was a bit hesitant in ordering this DVD, however I am pretty glad I did. I already feel the soreness creeping in which to me is a good thing! Building muscle is fabulous because muscle burns calories even after you are done. I would recommend this others who wish to tone, define and most importantly at any age it helps with your bone density.",1422576000,2,465,4.35632183908046
2974653,5,B000WH5AWO,"If you want a tough workout this is it. It is chaptered, so you can work any area even if you only have a few minutes to workout. I would say this is intermediate, and she gives moves for how to make it more advanced. I have never finished the ab portion after completeing the first sections! Whew!",1420502400,2,298,4.155172413793103
2974654,4,B000WH5AWO,"Strong Body, Ageless Body is a challenging workout by a very positive instructor who knows how to push you to your limits. I'd say this is for anyone who is intermediate to advanced and has some experience with Pilates and weight lifting. There are some good balance challenges and the exercises are shown at a rapid pace. If you are not already totally fit and maybe over 45 and a little overweight you may find some of the exercises to be slightly difficult. I modified where needed so I could keep up. What can you do when it seems like every workout is made for those between 20 and 30? You do what you can. What I found was that when I do the whole workout I end up feeling great. It is a true accomplishment to make it through 45 minutes of weight lifting and floor work. So I'd recommend this to anyone from 20-50 with some cautions. Go at your own pace if you need to and modify as you can.

I like how she explains how each exercise is beneficial for certain stages of life (postpartum, post-menopause, etc.)  The moaning in a quasi-porno style through me off a bit.

Erin is so refreshing after the hype of the cardio DVD's on the market.  It takes place in her living room - all by herself, in a very calm environment.  There is a little bit of cardio - at least I was breathing heavily at first, but it is primarily strength training.  I was able to follow along (low weights) for the 1st 2/3 of the DVD, then it got a lot  harder, which is good, so I'll have more to work toward.  She had some ab work which was very new to me.  I was definitely sore the next day.  This workout can also be made harder by using heavier weights.  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a solid weight workout at home.

Erin O'Brien leads this 43 minute workout one on one.  It appears to be shot in her living room, which makes it cozy.  You start with a warm up and then get right into the workout.  You will do 4 sets of standing exercises, each repeated 3 times.  The first set is lateral raises for shoulders followed by pli squats, next is bicep curls followed by squats, then French press for triceps followed by reverse lunges, lastly double arm rows followed by externally rotated squats.  For some of the lower body exercises the first set is done in a 2-2 count so you can get the feel of the exercise and your form right.  Erin also shows alternative options in the upper right hand corner in a separate screen, if you feel the exercises are too repetitive or easy.  Or other options may be to throw in a set of front shoulder raises or hammer curls to change it up, I might try that next time.

I do modify some of the standing work, for the second and third set of the reverse lunges I will do static lunges in place of them because they move pretty quickly, I find it works much better for me personally.  And since the workout moves at a fast pace, lighter weights are definitely appropriate here.  I used a pair of 5's, 8's and one 10 pounder for the tricep work.  When I tried this workout the first time I was using too heavy of weight and gave up on it after 15 minutes.  So lighter is best here, and you are constantly moving also, not much rest here.

Once the standing work is complete you move to the floor and do a set for chest and buns.  Pec flies for chest with bridge work for the lower body. This time each exercise is slightly different, rather than the same for the standing exercises.  If you choose to stick with the first option that is up to you.  From there you move into some more lower body and ab work, much of which is pilates inspired.  Erin has quite a background in pilates and it shows here.

Erin is a fine instructor, she gives a lot of form pointers and tips.  She can be a bit noisy at times which may be offputting to some people but overall it's not too bad.  Then there is the camera work, which has been mentioned in previous reviews, I found it a little odd but overall it doesn't take away from the workout, it's just a matter of getting used to it.  Then there is Erin herself, some would call her a little quirky and I would agree with that, again it's just a matter of personal preference.  You will either click with her or you won't.  I have found after doing this workout a few times that these things don't bother me.

This is a great workout, straight forward and gets the job done in under 45 minutes.  I did this workout yesterday and I am quite sore this morning, so I know that I worked everything well.  I like the variety that this workout brings in the traditional strength work and pilates inspired moves.  I see myself getting a lot of use out of this one.

Overall I give this 4.5 stars.",1367712000,6,3117,4.216216216216216

In winter desperation and being out of my workout routine for several months when I read the reviews on this, I decided for the price to give it at try.  I just watched it all the way through the first time. Didn't look that hard, and besides, how out of shape could I be?  Well after following Erin for just 20 minutes I realized how out of shape I'm in.  Erin's instructions were clear and well paced, so even uncoordinated me could ""get her rythym and follow along.  Looked easy... not so easy to actually do.  My leg muscles are sore, but I'm sure if I do this at least 3 times a week, this ol body will be in shape for the summer activities",1359072000,,810,4.254901960784314

I am a rather fit person (I've run 13 marathons) and I was sore after the first time I did this. I have no problem doing cardio, but weight training exercises always bore me. I like that this DVD gives me direction. I'm not one to just pick up some weights on my own and create a workout (although I'm sure other people do).

I specifically like how this DVD provides a small window showing more challenging versions of the exercises. By increasing your weights and moving up to those more challenging versions, this DVD should really last you awhile.

I love how she says ""you will be alright"" during parts of the routine especially during one of the more challenging floor exercise, and finally I love how I feel after the workout - totally invigorated!",1346889600,,509,4.302083333333333

Ordinary color switches to black and white, then to pseudo-colorized, and on many of these, they use a filter meant to suggest an old dusty film--bits of hair, blebs, flaws. The plain color photography is fine, but all the pseudo-artistic fiddles are intensely irritating. They make me very reluctant to use this DVD.",1337990400,,416,5.043478260869565

This workout is great! I've been doing it every other day for several weeks and I can alread feel the difference in my body and the way clothes are fitting. my only regret is that I didn't find Erin sooner. I like that each workout has an alternate option (which displays in the upper right corner of the screen) for a more advanced technique. She really works your entire body, but the workout goes by very quickly as she rotates through several movements for each body group.

I've been sore in places I didn't think could be, but I'm proud of how much more flexible and balanced I am in such a short time. Erin really encourages you to do your personal best, and each day my personal best is increasing. Doing the 40 minutes of this disc followed by 20 minutes of cycling (which seems to eliminate the leg soreness) really leaves me feeling great.

I do have a hard time with squats and lunges and getting the form right but they were very fast and most of the leg work were these two moves. There is some floor leg work also. I am not a beginner but could not keep up with her. I do feel worked out though and I only used 5 pound weights for the upper body. Maybe this is for more advanced exercisers than me.,1335052800,7,529,3.8623853211009176

Erin comes across professional and yet sincere, not sappy. I imagine she is a genuinely nice person. As such, she did NOT annoy me, rather, she led me through a great weight and floor routine. I'm stoked!! This is a great way to start the new year with a great new workout DVD. One more thing - the small inset screeen showing Erin doing the ""hard"" version of the exercise, is terrific.  On other DVDs, when they had someone doing the ""easy"" version alongside the ""capable"" person, I think might make the people doing the easy version feel less than. This reversal is totally empowering. I did the more difficult exercises when I was able, even if for just some of the reps, and of course I can work my way to more. Good job Erin!

2974780,5,B000WH5AWO,"Two great things happened for me this past year.

First, I discovered the books Seasoned Romance, Dr. Ruth's Sex at 50, and Grandpa Does Grandma, each of which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex and romance. One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.

Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including  Erin O'Brien's Strong Body, Ageless Body. Seniors can go from beginning to more advanced strength training. And I believe you will see great results in so many areas of your life, including better self image and ultimately greater sex!

More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.

Thanks, Erin O'Brien, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",1312243200,2,1061,4.938202247191011

2974783,5,B000WH5AWO,"This video will have wide appeal for advanced beginners. If you've grown tired of Leslie Sansone videos, and want to add some light weights to the mix this is a good place to start. Erin organizes the sets so that you do a series of reps first with the arms followed by reps with your legs. In the next section the arms first/legs second/repeat changes to a new series of muscles  As you progress through the video you move through the various muscle groups. The standing routine is followed by a floor routine for the abs and hip flexors. She really does a lot of hip flexor work which is excellent. Unlike ""The Firm"" videos, which can be a bit frenzied, this goes at a deliberate pace, giving the exerciser time to get into position, yet the video is not 'slow'. Erin's manner is pleasant and encouraging without being overly friendly.

Erin uses an excellent device of showing more advanced cuing in a video insert that does not disrupt the main screen.

I do this video with 5 lb weights (easy) and use all the advanced cuing. I find some of the floor work challenging. The arm work not so much, but you can always add heavier hand weights as you learn the routines.

I'm ambivalent about her use of a living room as an exercise site. The intent must be to show the routine can be done in a small area. That's good. Some videos from others cover the floor of a gym and I think ""I don't have that much space!"" The downside to filming in a home is the annoying echo from the hard surfaces. She needed a better sound man to solve that; but it's a trivial annoyance that is worth putting up with for this excellent exercise video.",1302220800,3,1630,4.36963696369637

I have trouble keeping up with intricate steps but Erin's workout is very easy to follow.  She has an upbeat warmup and easy cool down, too.  This isn't what I would call for a new beginner, more for an intermediate.  It would be very easy to bump up the intensity with heavier weights so this video could be used for years as you progress.  It's just Erin in the video, no pack of blonde, big-busted bimboes dancing around.  Routine looks like it's in a corner of her living room, with beautiful landscaping behind her.

No, you will not be lifting heavy weights or sprinting, but Erin O'Brien's non-stop routine has caused me and others to break a serious sweat, breathe hard, and spend the next day wincing from sore legs and abs.

The workout consists of 20+ minutes on your feet alternating between upper body and lower body exercises, then about 15 minutes of floor routine and then some stretches.  There are tougher varriatons of the exercises shown in a small window.  Whether you are a newcomer to personal fitness opr you are more experienced and looking to expand beyond weights and cardio, this is a very good workout.

I really liked the change of not looking at a studio. Her style also made me feel as if I was being personally trained. I also liked that you have a variety of moves you can do to make the workout more difficult. I think any level exerciser can enjoy this workout. I do think it is more an intermediate than an advanced dvd. I use it on days when I want a lighter but effective over all body workout. Or when I want to weight and strength train after an hour of cardio. If I want a tougher weight strength training then I use Jari Love's Get Ripped and Chisled.

1."" Erin is quirky."" I don't think she's quirky at all. I think she encourages you to work harder without trying to be cutesy or showing off how much more in shape she is than we are(even though, she is in amazing shape).
2. The photography is strange: with fading out to nearly colorless at times and cutting in with what looks like cheap home video footage, but I think it adds a little visual interest instead of a flat-on static view.
3. The music is boring. Yep. It's the non-descript exercise beats, but I think we want the focus to be on Erin.

Those are the weaknesses which I would say are minor. The true strength, and what we want an exercise video for to begin with is, that she is an excellent teacher: reminding me of my posture, to pull in my abs, to be sure I'm not going to hurt my knees, etc. She is encouraging in a very comfortable way. She's not scolding me about how I should be able to do something. Instead she talks about the benefits of strength training without being preachy, boring or condescending. What I like about this video, more than Jillian's video, is that it really works all my muscles and it feels great-instead of feeling like that ""take your medicine-you know this is good for you""-dread! I think some people won't even give this video a look because of the reference to staying young in the title. This work-out is a great one for any age! As someone else mentioned, she doesn't advise on what level of weight you should be using. I started with 3 lb wts but realized for most of the exercises, 5lbs was doable. My t-shirt was absolutely soaked after this workout: my measure of time well-spent. I highly recommend this video. I can see this being one of my favorites.",1266710400,12,2038,4.332460732984293
2974831,5,B000WH5AWO,I'm so happy I made this purchase.  It's such an awesome workout for the whole body.  I just love it!,1266105600,3,101,4.0
2974832,5,B000WH5AWO,"I'd give this DVD 10 stars if I could. It's perfect if you're looking for a moderate level strength training workout that's 40 minutes start to finish -- and that includes a 3-minute warm-up and cool-down. I'm in my fifties and in good cardiovascular shape -- I run, bike, or elliptical 5 days a week. But I wanted to incorporate strength training into my usual routine so I can stay strong, injury-free and maybe even lose a few inches in the process. This DVD gives me just that. I checked out a few others from my library, but they were either too rigorous and/or the instructors looked like they competed in body-building competitions. Erin O'Brien looks in shape (but not fanatically so) and is enthusiastic without being nauseatingly perky or hard-core. She also doesn't talk too much -- which is great because that can get old fast when you're watching the DVD for the 50th time. Another plus -- she includes a small video of herself at the top of the screen for a harder variation of the work-out. All in all, I love this strength training workout (I've already seen results) and hope Erin decides to make more DVDs.",1265760000,8,1124,4.625
2974833,5,B000WH5AWO,"This is a wonderful workout for someone getting back into shape. Keeps you out of breath, but not so much that you can't go on. I highly recommend it.",1265155200,4,150,4.206896551724138
2974834,3,B000WH5AWO,"OK all these reviews about killer workouts and I bought it. The exercises are good but Erin explains many of the exercise before she does them, stops and tells you how the exercise is good for a man or good for a woman, grabbing her chest or wiggling her arm to show you what will be worked. I was sick of the stop and go before I was a quarter through the workout. That is fine in an intro section but this means I'll have to listen to this EVERY time I do the workout and she will stop and go EVERY time I do the work out. This means by the second workout I will be really sick of that. And the artistic shots in black and white are stupid. I just want to see clearly what the instructor is doing and I don't need a black and white shoulder shot of her tatoo. It distracted me. I started wondering, ""What is that. A mushroom? An atom bomb, what?"" I have about 50 exercise DVDs so I'm not a newbie when it comes to exercise videos. If you want killer workouts that do the instructions outside of the workout, get something like the older FIRM workouts. Those FIRM workkouts are tough but the really move along and you are finished before you know it and you really do see results in 10 workouts like the FIRM claims.  Another great one is Women's Health Total Workout in Ten - Get the Body You want in the Time you Have. The only equipment you need for workout in ten is hand weights. Some of the later FIRM videos require gadgets. For the Workout in Ten, do only 10 or 20 mins or for a killer 40 min workout do all four - cardio, upper, lower & flexibility. I was torn about whether to give this DVD a 2 or a 3, because the exercises are good and once you learn them you can do them without the DVD and the constant explanations, but that is not why I buy a DVD. Good exercising all.",1264723200,83,1785,4.056657223796034
2974835,2,B000WH5AWO,"Very disappointing. Each exercise is done in 3 sets of 20 reps... kinda. Erin is completely inconsistent in the amount of reps she does when alternating sides and when doing each set. It happens way too often for me to be ok with having spent $10 to have to put my DVD on pause to catch up on the reps that she left out. (12 reps on one arm, 10 on the other...24 reps on one leg, 16 on the other...20 leg lifts on one side, 8 on the other!!) Plus, 200 squats/plies/lunges, not including the ones she makes you do in the warm up. 40 minutes of 50 reps of each exercise and only a 3 minute stretch at the end. It's ridiculous. She's ridiculous. At some point she sounds like she's having an orgasm, at another the camera spends a good 10 seconds on just her sneaker. This doesn't feel like a well planned out workout, it feels like I've entered the living room of some fitness nut who is randomly showing me every single exercise she knows. And, each ""c'mon"" doesn't feel encouraging to me, it feels like she's annoyed. I had really high hopes for this one but I just wish I could get my money back.

I am overweight and couldn't quite make it through the entire video. I found that incouraging not discouraging. I could do almost all of the lower level-impact exercises. I had difficulty with the floor ones. Even though they were difficult, I can see myself being able to actually do these in the future. Some videos I have tried I wouldn't have even attempted to do the excercise--not so with this instructor.
The video does scan in and out and goes to black and white. Personally, I did not find this distracting.
Overall, I was VERY impressed with this video and would recommend it to my friends. Especially friends that are overweight and need additional strengthening exercises.",1263859200,2,827,4.75
2974837,5,B000WH5AWO,"This was a fast and enjoyable 45-minute workout, with a warmup to get you going. Erin explains every move well, and her personality is calm and encouraging. In the first half there is an overlay showing optional variations. (I would have preferred seeing the variations full screen and the repeats inset, as you pretty quickly want to do the variations.)

Erin uses the same weights (two 6lb hand weights) throughout (plus a mat), but if you have 2 or 3 different weights handy you can easily swap them over if some muscles (like your biceps) can take more weight than others. The number of reps is about right too; just enough to tire you out but not too many that you'll get bored. She works the entire body well, but this is strength training only (no in-between cardio blasts or anything like that) - but some days you don't feel like jumping around anyway and just want to pump up. Definitely a keeper.",1263081600,3,907,4.564417177914111
2974838,4,B000WH5AWO,"I am 55 years old, walk daily and lift medium weights 3x per week and decided to add this to the exercise regimen.  This 45 minute set of exercises is not about heavy weight lifting.  You will be doing about 20 reps in 3 sets, moderately fast paced.  Erin is using 6 lb weights in each hand, so I started with 4 lbs.  You will do shoulders, squats (lots), biceps, rows, triceps, reverse lunges, lat rows and some balancing and abs.  This is all low impact, for those with creaky knees like me (yay!).  The first time using the DVD, I was 100% there with the weights, only about 75% able to keep up with the floor work.  Erin gives no advice as to what weights to pick, but does provide good instruction about posture.  There is a teeny, tiny box on the right hand side showing the more advanced moves.  Another odd bit is there are distracting changes in the filming, going to black and white, not very helpful.  Overall a very good workout, NOT for beginners, but on the mark for intermediate exercisers.",1260230400,15,1005,4.383783783783784
2974839,5,B000WH5AWO,"I was looking for a full body strength workout that wasn't too long.  At 45 minutes, this dvd fits the bill.  The workout covers upper body, lower body and abs.  After doing the workout a few times, I've felt the most sore in my legs and glutes, a bit in my upper body and not as much in my core.  I think adding heavier weights will make the upper body more challenging. (She also shows some more advanced moves to try.) If you were going to do this workout exclusively, I think you'd need to add some additional core work if you really wanted to work your abs.

A few reviewers have noted that she transitions quickly.  This is true at times.  But I'd much rather that she move along than spend too much time setting up each exercise.  Eventually I'll be able to catch up.  I have other dvds that I like, but the set up is so slow.  I wish that all producers of exercise dvd's would realize that if you do the workout enough times, you don't need or want to listen through all that set-up time after time.  Erin's personality is best described as quirky.  I like her attitude and much prefer her style over someone like Denise Austin.",1257638400,5,1136,4.28169014084507

I don't like buying something I haven't tried, so I checked this out at my local library and had the opportunity to try it before I bought it.  When I previewed this video, I wasn't sure that I would be able to do it; however, I was pleasantly surprised.  I found this exercise video challenging and doable.  I like working with the weights and doing the exercises with Erin as a leader.  She provides clear directions and gives plenty of instructions on how to do the exercise, how to hold your body, and how to breathe.  She also tells you what not to do and why the exercise is valuable for your body. You can select just parts of the video or you can do the whole thing.

  I am a 58 year old person (and not in the greatest shape) who enjoys exercising to strengthen my body.  I like the length of the exercise video and feel good after I finish the video.

I like how she talks to you along the way so you don't always notice how many reps you are doing.
If you are already in shape this will keep you that way; if you are trying to get in shape, you WILL feel sore the next day if you do everything, but you can take it slower and build up to it.  If you want something different than aerobic workouts, this is a nice change of pace and should be added to your repetoire.",1253836800,3,508,3.980392156862745

The DVD was perfect for me at the entry level and I look forward to trying the more challenging alternatives to the exercises.

2974864,5,B000WH5AWO,"I can't believe I like this DVD enough to write a review.  I either do free weights on my own, where I don't push myself enough, or Jari Love's Ripped workouts which sometimes feel like they're dragging on with the long warmup and introductions/stretches framing every segment (except for her newest, which is going in an interesting direction).

This DVD is super-efficient.  She offers modifications in an inset screen for most of the exercises.  The reps are enough to make you feel like you're getting a thorough workout, but it's under 45 minutes of exercises, so this is easy to fit into my routine.  She does a quick low-impact style warmup, alternating upper and lower body sets, and then floor work.  I usually skip the stretch because I do daily morning yoga, but I did it once and it was good, too.  The 15-20 minute time difference make this remarkably easier to fit into my morning routine compared with Ripped.

I really enjoy Erin's energy--it's down to earth, yet she comes across as knowledgeable, too.  Her outfit is cute and doesn't display a chiseled 6 pack, a huge plus for me because that just gets discouraging to look at.  Love Jari Love, but seeing her 0% fat body is always slightly intimidating and creepy.  Erin doesn't talk much about ""results"" and how many calories you're burning, which I find tiring on the Ripped videos, as awesome as they are.  I just don't really care how many carbs I'm burning--I want to build stamina and boost my resting metabolism, and build bone density.

I'm in my mid 30s and there's no chance I'm going to look perfect, but I would like to have strength and I'll take the ""ageless"" promise of this video, too.  I can't wait for Erin to create another free weights video!",1250553600,9,1731,4.651315789473684
2974865,5,B000WH5AWO,"I wasn't going to write a review since there are already so many good ones on here about this fantastic DVD, but every time I do this workout I can't wait to tell someone how much I love it.  So I just HAD to write another rave review about it.

When I bought this DVD I was looking to add strength training to my routine.  I have an elliptical machine, already for cardio.  It has been the best investment I could have made in my body.  I have been doing DVD's as a workout for many years, and this is my favorite now.  The instructor is pleasant and encouraging. She also explains what body parts you are working which is helpful. I love that it is not filmed in a cold studio.  It is bright and airy.  The exercises are basic, and VERY effective.  I have lost INCHES doing this workout 2-3 times a week.  And I feel stronger!

I have to say the first time I did this workout, I was incredibly sore the next day.  Actually the next couple of days.  When I felt better I did it again, and was not sore.  And I haven't been overly sore since then. So if you are new to strength training be prepared to feel it the next day!

My favorite part of the video is at the end when she says ""Be strong"".  I always feel like that is my pat on the back for having accomplished another great thing for my body.

Awesome workout!",1248739200,7,1317,4.08203125

It took doing 100 % of the level 1 workout of Jillian Michaels' 30 day shred to be able to do about 85% of this DVD. though Erin's workout is 45 minutes, you get to work almost every musle and the fact that she explains why one should do certain exercises is great.",1240444800,,458,4.4
2974868,5,B000WH5AWO,"I just purchased the ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" fitness video in March 2009, and I love it. I am turning 40 this year and thought it was time to add strength training to my weekly activities.

Erin O'Brien works out at home by herself in regular workout clothes with minimal props - yoga mat and hand weights. You don't even need the yoga mat if you are on carpet. Her instruction is clear and motivating without being over the top crazy. She emphasizes correct posture and shows you the proper way to stand and position your body for each move. The pace is great! She keeps up a medium to fast pace with no distracting loud music or extra talking. A few pop up windows appear throughout the routine in the upper right corner to show you more advanced moves, but they are not distracting at all.

The video is set up in chapters, so you can play the entire routine (approx. 40 minutes) or play a chapter at a time depending on what you want to work on or how much time you have. She starts out with a very quick cardio warmup, then goes into 30 minutes of weight exercises, then slows down a bit on the floor and ends with a stretch. Erin's routine focuses on building all over body strength and she uses six pound hand weights. I am using four pound weights, which is the perfect weight for me. I encourage beginners to start with two or three pound hand weights.

I love Erin's mature style and this video is a very intelligent workout!",1238976000,8,1439,4.342007434944238

It's hard to know what level of workout one will get - this one will work for both beginners (using lighter weights) and more experienced exercisers (using heavier weights).  No fancy footwork or equipment, just a no-nonsense, encouraging, upbeat approach to working all the major muscle groups.  It's now my favorite video (I've been a fan of the Firm workouts for years).",1238889600,2,455,4.883116883116883
2974890,5,B000WH5AWO,"One word: Wow!  I am so glad I found this DVD.  I'm in my mid-20s and am in good shape, as I've been working out fairly consistently since college.  However, I wanted to incorporate more strength training into my routine and thought this would be an appropriate-level challenge for me.  I have been doing Erin's Strong Body, Ageless Body workout for several weeks now and love it.  This is a great strength routine to add to your existing cardio and/or specialized routines (abs, Pilates, etc.).  The individual exercises are basic and uncomplicated, so participants of nearly any age/weight should be able to enjoy and benefit from this workout.

Erin O'Brien is amazing.  With this particular workout, she set up a tripod in her living room and created a comprehensive strength training routine just for you.  Although you can't ""customize"" this DVD like some other workouts (the 10 Minute series comes to mind), it is so much more personal than the cookie-cutter studio routines; it honestly feels like you have a one-on-one session with your favorite trainer.  Erin is a strong, down-to-earth, no-nonsense woman who cares about health and wants YOU to be strong too.  She makes you feel good about yourself and good about working out.  Her encouragement is nurturing (""Yes you can!"" and ""You're all right, I promise!""), and her demeanor is calm and focused.

For this 43-minute workout, you need a set of dumbbells (or soup cans) and a yoga mat (or towel).  Erin keeps the routine fast-paced, so even though there's not a lot of cardio per se, your heart rate stays up and pumping the whole time, and you still burn tons of calories.  She uses 6-pound dumbbells throughout the routine, but I started with 3-pounders and have worked my way up to 5-pounders, which I think I'll stick with for a while.  The routine covers all major muscle groups in the body: shoulders, upper/lower back, biceps, triceps, pectorals, upper/lower abs, hips, glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves.  It consists of 7 parts:

* Warm-up: A fun, get-your-blood-pumping series of aerobic movements. (4 minutes)

* Four standing upper/lower body segments: You need the weights here.  Erin does three sets of 16 repetitions for each exercise, and she alternates between upper and lower body -- 16 reps upper body, 16 reps lower body, repeat 2 more times, then move to the next set of exercises.  Transitions are quick.  In these four segments, Erin works the shoulders/upper back, biceps, triceps, lat row, quads, glutes, hams, calves, and inner/outer thighs (not in that order, though!). (20 minutes)

* Floorwork: This is where you need the mat.  Erin works the pecs, upper/lower abs, lower back, inner/outer thighs, hips, glutes, hams, calves, and overall balance.  She uses many Pilates moves in this segment and, as before, quickly alternates between upper and lower (or core) -- 8-16 reps depending on the exercise. (15 minutes)

* Cool-down: This calming stretching session finishes off what is possibly the most fabulous workout I've ever done in my life, but I do wish this segment were longer (4 minutes).  Erin doesn't stretch every muscle we used during the workout (no biceps, triceps, shoulders, or pecs), so I do my own stretches after the DVD ends.  Not a big deal.

There's a little call-out box in the upper right corner of the screen during most exercises that shows an advanced modification.  Erin does the ""easy"" move in the main frame, and once you're familiar with this, it's no problem to check the box for the advanced mod.  This is the opposite of how most instructors do it, and it ends up more encouraging this way because the advanced moves aren't the main feature.

The music is fun -- a little sporty/dancy, but not obnoxious, and definitely not loud or overbearing.  It's mainly there to keep you on pace with Erin's movements.

The first few times I did this workout, I kept up with Erin's quick-yet-manageable pace when I could do the exercise; but truth be told, I couldn't do every exercise!  Erin does a LOT of quad work in the four standing sections, and I sometimes had to sit out during the second and/or third sets of squats.  I can now do all of the exercises without stopping, but man, it's tough!

The only minor gripe I have with this routine is that sometimes Erin transitions very quickly between different exercises, mainly during the floorwork segment.  I have to pause it so that I can get my weights, get into position, ensure that my posture is correct, and then resume.  Erin is so seasoned that she can do this in 3 seconds, but on certain transitions, I need about 10. :)

Because this routine incorporates strength training for the whole body, and because Erin O'Brien is such an inspiring instructor, EVERYONE -- regardless of age or gender -- should have this in their home workout DVD collection.  Highly recommended!",1237852800,51,4851,4.859926918392205

I envision being strong for years to come.  I love her personality.  She is nurturing, fun, knowledgeable, professional, and personable.  I find her playfulness charming and calming.

I loved her style and challenging routines.  So I asked my husband to get this one for my birthday.  Another great one!  I really, really love how calm and soothing she is, and she's a great motivator.  She also really explains how to focus and breathe better than many other instructors.  And the routine is very challenging.  After the first time doing this my legs were wobbly and it was hard to stand up in the shower!  I hope Erin O'Brien releases more dvds in the future.",1218931200,6,638,4.526315789473684

In just 3 weeks I have noticed such a difference in muscle tone/endurance/overall fitness, that I'm addicted to working out, where before I'd find excuses to skip it. Erin is low key, encouraging and keeps it light.  I feel like I'm working out with a buddy as she's very motivating and funny as she doesn't take  herself so seriously and gets right down to business. And at only 45 min. I can fit this routine in even on my busiest days. People have always told me I don't look my age (over 40), and thanks to Erin, now I don't feel it either!!",1211241600,18,667,4.2362204724409445

2974914,5,B000WH5AWO,"Erin O'Brien crafts a friendly and straightforward routine that is focused on building a strong body. I saw this DVD in a store, and was drawn to the clean look of the cover. I wouldn't want to use a DVD that is focused on the ""sexy"" image, but something about this one looked likeable. Erin did not disappoint. I like how the routine keeps me going but challenges better than if I tried to start my own routine.

As a 20 year old, 115 pound young woman, I am not in bad shape and do not lead a sedentary lifestyle, but I am not strong either. I am a pianist who has started to take voice lessons. My voice teacher has encouraged me to build a stronger core. I think ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" is a great place to start. It combines weight exercises with cardiovascular exercises and core-building exercises. People who are in worse shape than I could start with it: Erin encourages us to work up to the exercises that are more difficult. She talks encouragingly throughout, but with no fake peppyness, while explaining the purpose of each exercise. And the workout is accompanied by a subtle, but active soundtrack. (As a classical musician, I can be sensitive to music that I find annoying.)

Even though the DVD could be used by people of lower fitness levels, it is still useful for all levels. There are sometimes small side-videos in the corner of the screen to show more challenging versions of the exercise on the main screen. I'm not ready for them yet, but I look forward to gaining smoothness with the routine and working up to the difficult versions. I am excited about gaining strength and using this DVD often.",1210118400,10,1625,4.5426621160409555

I find this workout to be very do-able and in fact, it really flys by. Erin is a motivating instructor. The workout consists of an overall warm up, weight work that includes squats, bicep curls, tricep extensions, reverse lunges and pec flys among others, floor work for the abs and core, and a stretch to cool down. The moves are not too fancy and that's why I like it.

The routine that Mrs. O'Brien leads the reviewer through is very thorough.  She begins with a very good warm-up, then she leads you from upper body to lower body exercises thus producing a good cardio workout, lastly she leads you through a refreshing cool-down.  The excerises are not hard in themselves, but if you are like me--out of shape--then you will find it a good motivater.  I've proabably done the workout now 4-6 times and am already seeing improvement.

I was quivering by the end of the workout - and I was thrilled!  I knew this was a tool I could use for a long time to come.  I've done fitness tapes/dvds for the past 15 years and I've bought my share of clunkers.  Either the workout got boring or the instructor got annoying.  Not here!  Erin gives you many ways to change up your workouts (which is a huge bonus) and she's very likeable, fun and motivating.  Even better, she's smart and challenging.  I enjoy and appreciate the fact that she educates you while you're working out, ie; what muscle groups you're working, etc.  Erin's a great trainer.  I've purchased her earlier dvds (she's a pre/postnatal specialist) and I loved them, too.  I still incorporate them into my rotation, that's how good they are.  I always learn something new.  If you're looking for a challenge, no matter what your ""condition"", Erin's the trainer for you.  Strong Body, Ageless Body rocks!",1199750400,71,1082,4.552083333333333

I'm a cardio junky, but I know I need to build in weight training so I keep trying new workouts to see if anything will get me to do the work. Until discovering Erin's DVD, I couldn't find anything that I wanted to finish, let alone incorporate into my regular rotation.

Now I'm doing this workout at least twice a week to supplement my cardio routine. It's a motivating, fast-paced series of exercises that switch between upper and lower body sets. The transitions are easy to follow but quick so your heart rate stays elevated and you're done before you know it. The program ends with a nice floor work section that incorporates inner/outer thigh work and abs/pilates exercises. Erin is very easy to follow and motivational. The program also includes a helpful corner graphic that shows you advanced options for every exercise.

I've got a lot of upper body strength, but my lower half is a little out of shape and flabby.  If what my thighs are telling me is true, then this should do the trick!

I also love how she tells you exactly why you're doing what you're doing and what the long term benefits are.  Sure, I can tell I'm going to get a better looking body, but it's also awesome to know that I'm helping to prevent osteoporosis, strengthening my connective tissue and raising my metabolism.

Erin is a great instructor.  She explains everything so well by telling you why you are doing what you're doing.  She cues well and so you always know what's coming up.  You can do the basic move that's demonstrated, or the tougher variations which is shown in a separate square in the corner of the screen.  That's a great feature in itself so you can progress easily and move up when you're ready.  All you need is some weights and you're ready to go.

I bought this one because it was, accurately, described as a step down. It doesn't take quite as much gumption for me to get started, but it's still a very satisfying workout. For anyone looking for more intensity, the box in the right corner shows her doing those variations.

It is slightly old school, with squats aplenty, and traditional high rep arm movements like bicep curls and chest flies. Erin adds some extra flavor, though, and I especially appreciate the care she takes to explain good form. It is mildly but not substantially aerobic, and all the major body parts get their turn.

3209098,5,B000WH5AWO,"I've been through multiple injuries and a diagnosis at one point in time that specified max weight limit of  5 lbs for life. This video is something I can do without hurting myself, with or without weights. The floor work at the end is challenging and finally works my hips and lower abdominal area in a way that doesn't give me pain later. Go slow, breathe through it, and have fun.

Pushing yourself to pain with exercise or rapid breathing only means going backwards ... at least for me. I've slowly and steadily gained muscle and ability to lift heavier weight without injury. With videos like those from Gilad and Erin O'Brien, I can lift 50 lbs and carry it a good distance without pain. My hip doesn't flare up anymore so that it limits my leg's range of motion by 20% or more.

Sitting around doing nothing would've guaranteed a 5 lb weight limit for life. I've had to walk without weights, do workouts without weights while they were using 5 lbs or 10 lbs. When they're doing 20 reps, I might do 5 in the same amount of time. I can't go as fast as the people in the workouts. And that's okay. Every little bit helps. Know your limits.

This workout has a little video that pops up in the corner with variations on workouts. So if you're bored with one exercise or it's too easy, you can try a harder variation.

I love what it's done to my hip strength. I used to do lunges and feel pain every time. Now I can actually do them, but I can't go all the way down yet. I got to help my parents move all kind of boxes for a move. The weights, the workout videos, the trial and error in learning limits, building up and going past them ... all worth it.

If something hurts, don't do it. Pain won't lead to progress. Anyway, each body is unique. Find what works for you. This video definitely works for me and I like it a lot.",1453248000,5,1829,4.241379310344827

3209149,5,B000WH5AWO,"I did this workout this morning and let me tell you I was sweating! Erin has you moving through each exercise swiftly. I was a bit hesitant in ordering this DVD, however I am pretty glad I did. I already feel the soreness creeping in which to me is a good thing! Building muscle is fabulous because muscle burns calories even after you are done. I would recommend this others who wish to tone, define and most importantly at any age it helps with your bone density.",1422576000,2,465,4.35632183908046

Whew!",1420502400,2,298,4.155172413793103
3209151,4,B000WH5AWO,"Strong Body, Ageless Body is a challenging workout by a very positive instructor who knows how to push you to your limits. I'd say this is for anyone who is intermediate to advanced and has some experience with Pilates and weight lifting. There are some good balance challenges and the exercises are shown at a rapid pace. If you are not already totally fit and maybe over 45 and a little overweight you may find some of the exercises to be slightly difficult. I modified where needed so I could keep up. What can you do when it seems like every workout is made for those between 20 and 30? You do what you can. What I found was that when I do the whole workout I end up feeling great. It is a true accomplishment to make it through 45 minutes of weight lifting and floor work. So I'd recommend this to anyone from 20-50 with some cautions. Go at your own pace if you need to and modify as you can.

It helps you increase your muscles while also getting you moving and your heart pumping.

3209213,5,B000WH5AWO,"I'd been doing cardio but wanted something which had a heavier focus on strength training, as I'm getting to the age where bone density is a factor and the cure is weight training. Erin is so refreshing after the hype of the cardio DVD's on the market.  It takes place in her living room - all by herself, in a very calm environment.  There is a little bit of cardio - at least I was breathing heavily at first, but it is primarily strength training.  I was able to follow along (low weights) for the 1st 2/3 of the DVD, then it got a lot  harder, which is good, so I'll have more to work toward.  She had some ab work which was very new to me.  I was definitely sore the next day.  This workout can also be made harder by using heavier weights.  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a solid weight workout at home.  I ordered her next one ""Strong Body, Fit Body"" which is supposed to contain more cardio along with the weights, but haven't tried it yet.",1377907200,3,962,4.184782608695652

3209216,4,B000WH5AWO,"I initially tried this workout last summer and didn't care for it at all.  I decided recently that I dismissed it too quickly and opted to give it another go, I am glad I did.

Erin O'Brien leads this 43 minute workout one on one.  It appears to be shot in her living room, which makes it cozy.  You start with a warm up and then get right into the workout.  You will do 4 sets of standing exercises, each repeated 3 times.  The first set is lateral raises for shoulders followed by pli squats, next is bicep curls followed by squats, then French press for triceps followed by reverse lunges, lastly double arm rows followed by externally rotated squats.  For some of the lower body exercises the first set is done in a 2-2 count so you can get the feel of the exercise and your form right.  Erin also shows alternative options in the upper right hand corner in a separate screen, if you feel the exercises are too repetitive or easy.  Or other options may be to throw in a set of front shoulder raises or hammer curls to change it up, I might try that next time.

I do modify some of the standing work, for the second and third set of the reverse lunges I will do static lunges in place of them because they move pretty quickly, I find it works much better for me personally.  And since the workout moves at a fast pace, lighter weights are definitely appropriate here.  I used a pair of 5's, 8's and one 10 pounder for the tricep work.  When I tried this workout the first time I was using too heavy of weight and gave up on it after 15 minutes.  So lighter is best here, and you are constantly moving also, not much rest here.

Once the standing work is complete you move to the floor and do a set for chest and buns.  Pec flies for chest with bridge work for the lower body. This time each exercise is slightly different, rather than the same for the standing exercises.  If you choose to stick with the first option that is up to you.  From there you move into some more lower body and ab work, much of which is pilates inspired.  Erin has quite a background in pilates and it shows here.

Erin is a fine instructor, she gives a lot of form pointers and tips.  She can be a bit noisy at times which may be offputting to some people but overall it's not too bad.  Then there is the camera work, which has been mentioned in previous reviews, I found it a little odd but overall it doesn't take away from the workout, it's just a matter of getting used to it.  Then there is Erin herself, some would call her a little quirky and I would agree with that, again it's just a matter of personal preference.  You will either click with her or you won't.  I have found after doing this workout a few times that these things don't bother me.

This is a great workout, straight forward and gets the job done in under 45 minutes.  I did this workout yesterday and I am quite sore this morning, so I know that I worked everything well.  I like the variety that this workout brings in the traditional strength work and pilates inspired moves.  I see myself getting a lot of use out of this one.

Overall I give this 4.5 stars.",1367712000,6,3117,4.216216216216216

In winter desperation and being out of my workout routine for several months when I read the reviews on this, I decided for the price to give it at try.  I just watched it all the way through the first time. Didn't look that hard, and besides, how out of shape could I be?  Well after following Erin for just 20 minutes I realized how out of shape I'm in.  Erin's instructions were clear and well paced, so even uncoordinated me could ""get her rythym and follow along.

My leg muscles are sore, but I'm sure if I do this at least 3 times a week, this ol body will be in shape for the summer activities",1359072000,,810,4.254901960784314

I am a rather fit person (I've run 13 marathons) and I was sore after the first time I did this. I have no problem doing cardio, but weight training exercises always bore me. I like that this DVD gives me direction. I'm not one to just pick up some weights on my own and create a workout (although I'm sure other people do).

I specifically like how this DVD provides a small window showing more challenging versions of the exercises. By increasing your weights and moving up to those more challenging versions, this DVD should really last you awhile.

I love how she says ""you will be alright"" during parts of the routine especially during one of the more challenging floor exercise, and finally I love how I feel after the workout - totally invigorated!",1346889600,,509,4.302083333333333

Ordinary color switches to black and white, then to pseudo-colorized, and on many of these, they use a filter meant to suggest an old dusty film--bits of hair, blebs, flaws. The plain color photography is fine, but all the pseudo-artistic fiddles are intensely irritating. They make me very reluctant to use this DVD.",1337990400,,416,5.043478260869565

This workout is great! I've been doing it every other day for several weeks and I can alread feel the difference in my body and the way clothes are fitting. my only regret is that I didn't find Erin sooner. I like that each workout has an alternate option (which displays in the upper right corner of the screen) for a more advanced technique. She really works your entire body, but the workout goes by very quickly as she rotates through several movements for each body group.

I've been sore in places I didn't think could be, but I'm proud of how much more flexible and balanced I am in such a short time. Erin really encourages you to do your personal best, and each day my personal best is increasing. Doing the 40 minutes of this disc followed by 20 minutes of cycling (which seems to eliminate the leg soreness) really leaves me feeling great.

3209257,3,B000WH5AWO,I should have listened to some of the other reviews I read on this dvd. Erin moves too fast from one move to another and doesn't keep a correct count on the leg moves. I do have a hard time with squats and lunges and getting the form right but they were very fast and most of the leg work were these two moves. There is some floor leg work also. I am not a beginner but could not keep up with her. I do feel worked out though and I only used 5 pound weights for the upper body. Maybe this is for more advanced exercisers than me.,1335052800,7,529,3.8623853211009176

Erin comes across professional and yet sincere, not sappy. I imagine she is a genuinely nice person. As such, she did NOT annoy me, rather, she led me through a great weight and floor routine. I'm stoked!! This is a great way to start the new year with a great new workout DVD. One more thing - the small inset screeen showing Erin doing the ""hard"" version of the exercise, is terrific.  On other DVDs, when they had someone doing the ""easy"" version alongside the ""capable"" person, I think might make the people doing the easy version feel less than. This reversal is totally empowering. I did the more difficult exercises when I was able, even if for just some of the reps, and of course I can work my way to more. Good job Erin!

3209277,5,B000WH5AWO,"Two great things happened for me this past year.

First, I discovered the books Seasoned Romance, Dr. Ruth's Sex at 50, and Grandpa Does Grandma, each of which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex and romance. One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.

Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including  Erin O'Brien's Strong Body, Ageless Body. Seniors can go from beginning to more advanced strength training. And I believe you will see great results in so many areas of your life, including better self image and ultimately greater sex!

More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.

Thanks, Erin O'Brien, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",1312243200,2,1061,4.938202247191011

3209280,5,B000WH5AWO,"This video will have wide appeal for advanced beginners. If you've grown tired of Leslie Sansone videos, and want to add some light weights to the mix this is a good place to start. Erin organizes the sets so that you do a series of reps first with the arms followed by reps with your legs. In the next section the arms first/legs second/repeat changes to a new series of muscles  As you progress through the video you move through the various muscle groups. The standing routine is followed by a floor routine for the abs and hip flexors. She really does a lot of hip flexor work which is excellent. Unlike ""The Firm"" videos, which can be a bit frenzied, this goes at a deliberate pace, giving the exerciser time to get into position, yet the video is not 'slow'. Erin's manner is pleasant and encouraging without being overly friendly.

Erin uses an excellent device of showing more advanced cuing in a video insert that does not disrupt the main screen.

I do this video with 5 lb weights (easy) and use all the advanced cuing. I find some of the floor work challenging. The arm work not so much, but you can always add heavier hand weights as you learn the routines.

I'm ambivalent about her use of a living room as an exercise site. The intent must be to show the routine can be done in a small area. That's good. Some videos from others cover the floor of a gym and I think ""I don't have that much space!"" The downside to filming in a home is the annoying echo from the hard surfaces. She needed a better sound man to solve that; but it's a trivial annoyance that is worth putting up with for this excellent exercise video.",1302220800,3,1630,4.36963696369637
3209281,5,B000WH5AWO,"I have quite a collection of workout videos, from yoga, weight lifting, stretching and cardio. I have to put this one near the top of my favorites list.  Erin comes across as professional, experienced, caring and genuine.  This is a near full body workout with no bouncing around, which I hate to do.  I have trouble keeping up with intricate steps but Erin's workout is very easy to follow.  She has an upbeat warmup and easy cool down, too.  This isn't what I would call for a new beginner, more for an intermediate.  It would be very easy to bump up the intensity with heavier weights so this video could be used for years as you progress.  It's just Erin in the video, no pack of blonde, big-busted bimboes dancing around.  Routine looks like it's in a corner of her living room, with beautiful landscaping behind her.  Can't recommend this video highly enough!",1301356800,6,865,4.601307189542483

In my opinion this video is a better weight-training workout than Erin's newer video Strong Body, Fit Body,

But Strong Body, Fit Body is a better cardio workout,
so altering between the two videos should yield an excellent, varied combination.

Strong Body, Ageless Body is about 42 minutes.  There's no cardio; instead you alternate quickly between upper and lower body exercises (very fast change, little time to change weights), which keeps the heart rate up.  Then down to the floor for some great chest work and some unusual ab work (like ""snow angels"").

Erin is very enthusiastic about exercise and it shows.  I didn't find her condescending; quite the opposite.  She loves what she does and it's apparent.

I got much more than I bargained for - this is a tough work out.  No, you will not be lifting heavy weights or sprinting, but Erin O'Brien's non-stop routine has caused me and others to break a serious sweat, breathe hard, and spend the next day wincing from sore legs and abs.

The workout consists of 20+ minutes on your feet alternating between upper body and lower body exercises, then about 15 minutes of floor routine and then some stretches.  There are tougher varriatons of the exercises shown in a small window.  Whether you are a newcomer to personal fitness opr you are more experienced and looking to expand beyond weights and cardio, this is a very good workout.

I got it on Amazon, and it came w/ an online version (in my Amazon library) as well which is pretty nice.

I really like that you can do this workout with one set of weights and a mat.  There is only one place where I notice that the repetitions are not consistent (leg lifts) and for that I just start that segment on a different side each time, it's no big deal.

She is not the whiney 1,2 3 aerobics girl of yesterday but she does have this mother earth tone to her. I like her instruction and the setting of being in a home is very relaxing and different. I really liked the change of not looking at a studio. Her style also made me feel as if I was being personally trained. I also liked that you have a variety of moves you can do to make the workout more difficult. I think any level exerciser can enjoy this workout. I do think it is more an intermediate than an advanced dvd. I use it on days when I want a lighter but effective over all body workout. Or when I want to weight and strength train after an hour of cardio. If I want a tougher weight strength training then I use Jari Love's Get Ripped and Chisled.

3209327,5,B000WH5AWO,"I never heard of Erin O'Brien but I have been doing Jillian's 30 day shred and am getting tired of her ""banter"" over and over. I thought I'd give this video a whirl and I'm glad I did! I just woke up and every muscle in my body is sore today....but in a good way.

First, I wanted to respond to what other reviewers have said:
1."" Erin is quirky."" I don't think she's quirky at all. I think she encourages you to work harder without trying to be cutesy or showing off how much more in shape she is than we are(even though, she is in amazing shape).
2. The photography is strange: with fading out to nearly colorless at times and cutting in with what looks like cheap home video footage, but I think it adds a little visual interest instead of a flat-on static view.
3. The music is boring. Yep. It's the non-descript exercise beats, but I think we want the focus to be on Erin.

Those are the weaknesses which I would say are minor. The true strength, and what we want an exercise video for to begin with is, that she is an excellent teacher: reminding me of my posture, to pull in my abs, to be sure I'm not going to hurt my knees, etc. She is encouraging in a very comfortable way. She's not scolding me about how I should be able to do something. Instead she talks about the benefits of strength training without being preachy, boring or condescending. What I like about this video, more than Jillian's video, is that it really works all my muscles and it feels great-instead of feeling like that ""take your medicine-you know this is good for you""-dread! I think some people won't even give this video a look because of the reference to staying young in the title. This work-out is a great one for any age! As someone else mentioned, she doesn't advise on what level of weight you should be using. I started with 3 lb wts but realized for most of the exercises, 5lbs was doable. My t-shirt was absolutely soaked after this workout: my measure of time well-spent. I highly recommend this video. I can see this being one of my favorites.",1266710400,12,2038,4.332460732984293

3209329,5,B000WH5AWO,"I'd give this DVD 10 stars if I could. It's perfect if you're looking for a moderate level strength training workout that's 40 minutes start to finish -- and that includes a 3-minute warm-up and cool-down. I'm in my fifties and in good cardiovascular shape -- I run, bike, or elliptical 5 days a week. But I wanted to incorporate strength training into my usual routine so I can stay strong, injury-free and maybe even lose a few inches in the process. This DVD gives me just that. I checked out a few others from my library, but they were either too rigorous and/or the instructors looked like they competed in body-building competitions. Erin O'Brien looks in shape (but not fanatically so) and is enthusiastic without being nauseatingly perky or hard-core. She also doesn't talk too much -- which is great because that can get old fast when you're watching the DVD for the 50th time. Another plus -- she includes a small video of herself at the top of the screen for a harder variation of the work-out. All in all, I love this strength training workout (I've already seen results) and hope Erin decides to make more DVDs.",1265760000,8,1124,4.625

3209331,3,B000WH5AWO,"OK all these reviews about killer workouts and I bought it. The exercises are good but Erin explains many of the exercise before she does them, stops and tells you how the exercise is good for a man or good for a woman, grabbing her chest or wiggling her arm to show you what will be worked. I was sick of the stop and go before I was a quarter through the workout. That is fine in an intro section but this means I'll have to listen to this EVERY time I do the workout and she will stop and go EVERY time I do the work out. This means by the second workout I will be really sick of that. And the artistic shots in black and white are stupid. I just want to see clearly what the instructor is doing and I don't need a black and white shoulder shot of her tatoo. It distracted me. I started wondering, ""What is that. A mushroom? An atom bomb, what?"" I have about 50 exercise DVDs so I'm not a newbie when it comes to exercise videos. If you want killer workouts that do the instructions outside of the workout, get something like the older FIRM workouts. Those FIRM workkouts are tough but the really move along and you are finished before you know it and you really do see results in 10 workouts like the FIRM claims.  Another great one is Women's Health Total Workout in Ten - Get the Body You want in the Time you Have. The only equipment you need for workout in ten is hand weights. Some of the later FIRM videos require gadgets. For the Workout in Ten, do only 10 or 20 mins or for a killer 40 min workout do all four - cardio, upper, lower & flexibility. I was torn about whether to give this DVD a 2 or a 3, because the exercises are good and once you learn them you can do them without the DVD and the constant explanations, but that is not why I buy a DVD. Good exercising all.",1264723200,83,1785,4.056657223796034
3209332,2,B000WH5AWO,"Very disappointing. Each exercise is done in 3 sets of 20 reps... kinda. Erin is completely inconsistent in the amount of reps she does when alternating sides and when doing each set. It happens way too often for me to be ok with having spent $10 to have to put my DVD on pause to catch up on the reps that she left out. (12 reps on one arm, 10 on the other...24 reps on one leg, 16 on the other...20 leg lifts on one side, 8 on the other!!) Plus, 200 squats/plies/lunges, not including the ones she makes you do in the warm up. 40 minutes of 50 reps of each exercise and only a 3 minute stretch at the end. It's ridiculous. She's ridiculous. At some point she sounds like she's having an orgasm, at another the camera spends a good 10 seconds on just her sneaker. This doesn't feel like a well planned out workout, it feels like I've entered the living room of some fitness nut who is randomly showing me every single exercise she knows. And, each ""c'mon"" doesn't feel encouraging to me, it feels like she's annoyed. I had really high hopes for this one but I just wish I could get my money back.

I had difficulty with the floor ones. Even though they were difficult, I can see myself being able to actually do these in the future. Some videos I have tried I wouldn't have even attempted to do the excercise--not so with this instructor.
The video does scan in and out and goes to black and white. Personally, I did not find this distracting.

In the first half there is an overlay showing optional variations. (I would have preferred seeing the variations full screen and the repeats inset, as you pretty quickly want to do the variations.)

Erin uses the same weights (two 6lb hand weights) throughout (plus a mat), but if you have 2 or 3 different weights handy you can easily swap them over if some muscles (like your biceps) can take more weight than others. The number of reps is about right too; just enough to tire you out but not too many that you'll get bored. She works the entire body well, but this is strength training only (no in-between cardio blasts or anything like that) - but some days you don't feel like jumping around anyway and just want to pump up.

3209335,4,B000WH5AWO,"I am 55 years old, walk daily and lift medium weights 3x per week and decided to add this to the exercise regimen.  This 45 minute set of exercises is not about heavy weight lifting.  You will be doing about 20 reps in 3 sets, moderately fast paced.  Erin is using 6 lb weights in each hand, so I started with 4 lbs.  You will do shoulders, squats (lots), biceps, rows, triceps, reverse lunges, lat rows and some balancing and abs.  This is all low impact, for those with creaky knees like me (yay!).  The first time using the DVD, I was 100% there with the weights, only about 75% able to keep up with the floor work.  Erin gives no advice as to what weights to pick, but does provide good instruction about posture.  There is a teeny, tiny box on the right hand side showing the more advanced moves.  Another odd bit is there are distracting changes in the filming, going to black and white, not very helpful.

3209336,5,B000WH5AWO,"I was looking for a full body strength workout that wasn't too long.  At 45 minutes, this dvd fits the bill.  The workout covers upper body, lower body and abs.  After doing the workout a few times, I've felt the most sore in my legs and glutes, a bit in my upper body and not as much in my core.  I think adding heavier weights will make the upper body more challenging. (She also shows some more advanced moves to try.) If you were going to do this workout exclusively, I think you'd need to add some additional core work if you really wanted to work your abs.

A few reviewers have noted that she transitions quickly.  This is true at times.  But I'd much rather that she move along than spend too much time setting up each exercise.  Eventually I'll be able to catch up.  I have other dvds that I like, but the set up is so slow.  I wish that all producers of exercise dvd's would realize that if you do the workout enough times, you don't need or want to listen through all that set-up time after time.  Erin's personality is best described as quirky.  I like her attitude and much prefer her style over someone like Denise Austin.",1257638400,5,1136,4.28169014084507

I like working with the weights and doing the exercises with Erin as a leader.

3209361,5,B000WH5AWO,"I can't believe I like this DVD enough to write a review.  I either do free weights on my own, where I don't push myself enough, or Jari Love's Ripped workouts which sometimes feel like they're dragging on with the long warmup and introductions/stretches framing every segment (except for her newest, which is going in an interesting direction).

This DVD is super-efficient.  She offers modifications in an inset screen for most of the exercises.  The reps are enough to make you feel like you're getting a thorough workout, but it's under 45 minutes of exercises, so this is easy to fit into my routine.  She does a quick low-impact style warmup, alternating upper and lower body sets, and then floor work.  I usually skip the stretch because I do daily morning yoga, but I did it once and it was good, too.  The 15-20 minute time difference make this remarkably easier to fit into my morning routine compared with Ripped.

I really enjoy Erin's energy--it's down to earth, yet she comes across as knowledgeable, too.  Her outfit is cute and doesn't display a chiseled 6 pack, a huge plus for me because that just gets discouraging to look at.  Love Jari Love, but seeing her 0% fat body is always slightly intimidating and creepy.  Erin doesn't talk much about ""results"" and how many calories you're burning, which I find tiring on the Ripped videos, as awesome as they are.  I just don't really care how many carbs I'm burning--I want to build stamina and boost my resting metabolism, and build bone density.

I'm in my mid 30s and there's no chance I'm going to look perfect, but I would like to have strength and I'll take the ""ageless"" promise of this video, too.  I can't wait for Erin to create another free weights video!",1250553600,9,1731,4.651315789473684
3209362,5,B000WH5AWO,"I wasn't going to write a review since there are already so many good ones on here about this fantastic DVD, but every time I do this workout I can't wait to tell someone how much I love it.  So I just HAD to write another rave review about it.

When I bought this DVD I was looking to add strength training to my routine.  I have an elliptical machine, already for cardio.  It has been the best investment I could have made in my body.  I have been doing DVD's as a workout for many years, and this is my favorite now.  The instructor is pleasant and encouraging. She also explains what body parts you are working which is helpful. I love that it is not filmed in a cold studio.  It is bright and airy.  The exercises are basic, and VERY effective.  I have lost INCHES doing this workout 2-3 times a week.  And I feel stronger!

I have to say the first time I did this workout, I was incredibly sore the next day.  Actually the next couple of days.  When I felt better I did it again, and was not sore.  And I haven't been overly sore since then. So if you are new to strength training be prepared to feel it the next day!

My favorite part of the video is at the end when she says ""Be strong"".  I always feel like that is my pat on the back for having accomplished another great thing for my body.

Awesome workout!",1248739200,7,1317,4.08203125

She is very good at explaining how you should do certain moves which I think is very important. It took doing 100 % of the level 1 workout of Jillian Michaels' 30 day shred to be able to do about 85% of this DVD. though Erin's workout is 45 minutes, you get to work almost every musle and the fact that she explains why one should do certain exercises is great.",1240444800,,458,4.4
3209365,5,B000WH5AWO,"I just purchased the ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" fitness video in March 2009, and I love it. I am turning 40 this year and thought it was time to add strength training to my weekly activities.

Erin O'Brien works out at home by herself in regular workout clothes with minimal props - yoga mat and hand weights. You don't even need the yoga mat if you are on carpet. Her instruction is clear and motivating without being over the top crazy. She emphasizes correct posture and shows you the proper way to stand and position your body for each move. The pace is great! She keeps up a medium to fast pace with no distracting loud music or extra talking. A few pop up windows appear throughout the routine in the upper right corner to show you more advanced moves, but they are not distracting at all.

The video is set up in chapters, so you can play the entire routine (approx. 40 minutes) or play a chapter at a time depending on what you want to work on or how much time you have. She starts out with a very quick cardio warmup, then goes into 30 minutes of weight exercises, then slows down a bit on the floor and ends with a stretch. Erin's routine focuses on building all over body strength and she uses six pound hand weights. I am using four pound weights, which is the perfect weight for me. I encourage beginners to start with two or three pound hand weights.

I love Erin's mature style and this video is a very intelligent workout!",1238976000,8,1439,4.342007434944238
3209366,5,B000WH5AWO,"I've been working with small weights for a while and needed a new workout video.  It's hard to know what level of workout one will get - this one will work for both beginners (using lighter weights) and more experienced exercisers (using heavier weights).  No fancy footwork or equipment, just a no-nonsense, encouraging, upbeat approach to working all the major muscle groups.  It's now my favorite video (I've been a fan of the Firm workouts for years).",1238889600,2,455,4.883116883116883
3209387,5,B000WH5AWO,"One word: Wow!  I am so glad I found this DVD.  I'm in my mid-20s and am in good shape, as I've been working out fairly consistently since college.  However, I wanted to incorporate more strength training into my routine and thought this would be an appropriate-level challenge for me.  I have been doing Erin's Strong Body, Ageless Body workout for several weeks now and love it.  This is a great strength routine to add to your existing cardio and/or specialized routines (abs, Pilates, etc.).  The individual exercises are basic and uncomplicated, so participants of nearly any age/weight should be able to enjoy and benefit from this workout.

Erin O'Brien is amazing.  With this particular workout, she set up a tripod in her living room and created a comprehensive strength training routine just for you.  Although you can't ""customize"" this DVD like some other workouts (the 10 Minute series comes to mind), it is so much more personal than the cookie-cutter studio routines; it honestly feels like you have a one-on-one session with your favorite trainer.  Erin is a strong, down-to-earth, no-nonsense woman who cares about health and wants YOU to be strong too.  She makes you feel good about yourself and good about working out.  Her encouragement is nurturing (""Yes you can!"" and ""You're all right, I promise!""), and her demeanor is calm and focused.

For this 43-minute workout, you need a set of dumbbells (or soup cans) and a yoga mat (or towel).  Erin keeps the routine fast-paced, so even though there's not a lot of cardio per se, your heart rate stays up and pumping the whole time, and you still burn tons of calories.  She uses 6-pound dumbbells throughout the routine, but I started with 3-pounders and have worked my way up to 5-pounders, which I think I'll stick with for a while.  The routine covers all major muscle groups in the body: shoulders, upper/lower back, biceps, triceps, pectorals, upper/lower abs, hips, glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves.  It consists of 7 parts:

* Warm-up: A fun, get-your-blood-pumping series of aerobic movements. (4 minutes)

* Four standing upper/lower body segments: You need the weights here.  Erin does three sets of 16 repetitions for each exercise, and she alternates between upper and lower body -- 16 reps upper body, 16 reps lower body, repeat 2 more times, then move to the next set of exercises.  Transitions are quick.  In these four segments, Erin works the shoulders/upper back, biceps, triceps, lat row, quads, glutes, hams, calves, and inner/outer thighs (not in that order, though!). (20 minutes)

* Floorwork: This is where you need the mat.  Erin works the pecs, upper/lower abs, lower back, inner/outer thighs, hips, glutes, hams, calves, and overall balance.  She uses many Pilates moves in this segment and, as before, quickly alternates between upper and lower (or core) -- 8-16 reps depending on the exercise. (15 minutes)

* Cool-down: This calming stretching session finishes off what is possibly the most fabulous workout I've ever done in my life, but I do wish this segment were longer (4 minutes).  Erin doesn't stretch every muscle we used during the workout (no biceps, triceps, shoulders, or pecs), so I do my own stretches after the DVD ends.  Not a big deal.

There's a little call-out box in the upper right corner of the screen during most exercises that shows an advanced modification.  Erin does the ""easy"" move in the main frame, and once you're familiar with this, it's no problem to check the box for the advanced mod.  This is the opposite of how most instructors do it, and it ends up more encouraging this way because the advanced moves aren't the main feature.

The music is fun -- a little sporty/dancy, but not obnoxious, and definitely not loud or overbearing.  It's mainly there to keep you on pace with Erin's movements.

The first few times I did this workout, I kept up with Erin's quick-yet-manageable pace when I could do the exercise; but truth be told, I couldn't do every exercise!  Erin does a LOT of quad work in the four standing sections, and I sometimes had to sit out during the second and/or third sets of squats.  I can now do all of the exercises without stopping, but man, it's tough!

The only minor gripe I have with this routine is that sometimes Erin transitions very quickly between different exercises, mainly during the floorwork segment.  I have to pause it so that I can get my weights, get into position, ensure that my posture is correct, and then resume.  Erin is so seasoned that she can do this in 3 seconds, but on certain transitions, I need about 10. :)

Because this routine incorporates strength training for the whole body, and because Erin O'Brien is such an inspiring instructor, EVERYONE -- regardless of age or gender -- should have this in their home workout DVD collection.  Highly recommended!",1237852800,51,4851,4.859926918392205
3209388,4,B000WH5AWO,"This workout can be done in one 45-minute block, or you can do the first 20 minutes alone. The first 20 minutes combines warm-up and strength-training, alternating between upper body and lower body sequences. You can use hand weights in whatever size is comfortable.

I really do notice a difference already and it's good to feel muscles that I had no idea were being neglected in my old stale routine.  I've been using this video twice a week, and then ""do my own thing"" on the third day which incorporates some of her new moves.

It kicked my behind the first couple of times, especially that last leg section on the floor.  Killer!  I quickly noticed a difference in strength and a boost in my running.  This is truly a great entire body workout in a minimal amount of time.  Combining upper and lower body in the same DVD forces me to do both.  Other DVDs that split them up invite me to somehow skip one or the other.  Erin reminds us why we are here; that strength training is a lifetime commitment.  I envision being strong for years to come.  I love her personality.  She is nurturing, fun, knowledgeable, professional, and personable.  I find her playfulness charming and calming.  She invites you to allow her to help you be your best.  I see why she has succeeded in both New York and Los Angeles.

I really, really love how calm and soothing she is, and she's a great motivator.  She also really explains how to focus and breathe better than many other instructors.

Erin is low key, encouraging and keeps it light.  I feel like I'm working out with a buddy as she's very motivating and funny as she doesn't take  herself so seriously and gets right down to business. And at only 45 min.

I wouldn't want to use a DVD that is focused on the ""sexy"" image, but something about this one looked likeable. Erin did not disappoint. I like how the routine keeps me going but challenges better than if I tried to start my own routine.

As a 20 year old, 115 pound young woman, I am not in bad shape and do not lead a sedentary lifestyle, but I am not strong either. I am a pianist who has started to take voice lessons. My voice teacher has encouraged me to build a stronger core. I think ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" is a great place to start. It combines weight exercises with cardiovascular exercises and core-building exercises. People who are in worse shape than I could start with it: Erin encourages us to work up to the exercises that are more difficult. She talks encouragingly throughout, but with no fake peppyness, while explaining the purpose of each exercise. And the workout is accompanied by a subtle, but active soundtrack. (As a classical musician, I can be sensitive to music that I find annoying.)

Even though the DVD could be used by people of lower fitness levels, it is still useful for all levels. There are sometimes small side-videos in the corner of the screen to show more challenging versions of the exercise on the main screen. I'm not ready for them yet, but I look forward to gaining smoothness with the routine and working up to the difficult versions.
