8535739,3,B0094AH3PC,"This is an altogether different conception than we have seen hitherto. The setting is a mix of modern and classic elements. It comes from Trieste. ""La battaglia"" is said to be the last of Verdi's early operas. The story alludes, as so often in the previous operas, on the freedom and unification of Italy. The staging does little to lighten up the stiff and somewhat pompous opera. Of the four main singers, I liked Andrew Richards (Arrigo) best. Dimitra  Theodossiou (Lida) is soprano with a big vibrato. She convinced more later on, I thought, Leonardo Lpez Linares (Rolando) is a bit wobbly, and did not improve as much. As a whole, the interpretation is difficult to grasp and to understand.",1414022400,,695,4.791666666666667
8535740,4,B0094AH3PC,"I'll start out by saying this has never been one of my favorite Verdi operas.  I've never seem a live performance but have found the CD's I owned rather boring. I wasn't going to bother to write a review as I basically agreed with all three of the previous reviews (any review by Mr. Gleeson commands the greatest respect from me) even though they themselves had some serious disagreements amongst themselves.  Yes, it is possible to see the basic truths in two opposing points of view.  But then I realized I do have a few additional comments to make.

The opera becomes more interesting as it goes along. The much commented on non-direction is sadly too true, especially with the chorus which seem very non-involved most of the time.

The strange background setting is a bit of a distraction but is passively in the background and does not really interfere with the storyline. It disappears completely for large parts of the performance where there is only a black background. The dress is vaguely 18th-19th century but I doubt authentic to the period of the actual battle (1176). But since this opera is so rarely filmed is it so much to ask that a more traditional setting and costuming be used? It's one thing to upgrade a warhorse such as La Traviata which most people have seen a number of times and which has no real historical connection and quite another to upgrade one such as La Battaglia which is firmly set in an historical time and place and also is the only opportunity for most of us to ever see it.

I though the soprano was generally fine and emotive, the best actor in the group although that's not saying much. The tenor, while attractive and with a good voice, lacked much emotional connection and, like all the actors in this performance, just stood his ground and sang with no real acting. He did become a bit more emotive in the later acts with a commendable performance in his final act death scene.  I'd give him another chance if he shows up in a different film. Perhaps with better directing he'd shine more.

I'd give it 3.5 stars if that were a option.  If you're a completist this is probably essential and well worth the cost.  If you're just wanting some entertaining early Verdi there are much better choices out there both within the Tutto Verdi series and elsewhere.",1378944000,3,2303,4.60880195599022
8535741,4,B0094AH3PC,"This early Verdi opera is seldom done.  It doesn't have the immediacy and impact of his later work and is in more of a recognizable Bellini-Donizetti mode.  The performance and production are more than satisfactory but less than inspired.  For serious Verdians, this is a must.  For the more casual  operagoers, an option.",1373328000,2,322,5.0
8535742,4,B0094AH3PC,"La Bataglia di Legnano is a Verdi opera and the only one that I haven't seen in production. I had an LP of it and can barely remember anything of it except the Overture. So I was really surprised (happily) when this production in the Tutto Verdi series turned out to be so enjoyable. This was such a surprise since I'm not a Theodossiou fan after she murdered Norma on her recording of it. Even she did a pretty good job on most of he singing except when challenged in her two difficult arias. Then she slips, slides and covers her lack of technique as is her wont.
The two big stars of the production are the male singers and the conductor. Lopez Linares was right on in his declamation of the part of Rolando. His voice was rich and well focused. He never wavered in his vocal production or tired. He was believable in his intonation and his projection was accurate. A delight to listen to.
Andrew Richards is new to me but I hope to hear more. He was excellent as he projected the heroic figure of Arrigo. His vocal production was mostly quite accurate; he is tall and handsome and should have a good career. The small part of Barbarossa was well managed by Enrico G. Iori and one wished to hear more of that rich, resonate voice. The conductor Boris Bott was not heavy handed but kept everything moving at a good pace and under firm control. The quality of the orchestra and particularly the solo passages was most gratifying. and from the brief views, the Trieste Opera House is a handsome building.
I wish I could avoid comment on the stage direction since there wasn't any. It was close to chaos in the chorus and the sets. No direction, just aimless milling around. I just didn't look at them or the scattered mess over the stage floor. The whole thing was simply silly; the regie should be fired (Cappuccio and Savi) Whatever point they were trying to make was simply lost and one avoided looking at anything but the singers. I took off only one star for this ill-conceived mess.",1370736000,3,1988,4.449315068493151
8535743,4,B0094AH3PC,"Verdi wrote his most patriotic opera  during the turbulent events of the 1848 revolutions, the first of the series of many uprisings of the Risorgimento. Unfortunately Verdi had more important things to do than taking part in the revolution as he busied himself in Paris and having a good time with Giuseppina Strepponi who soon became his mistress and much later, his second wife. The opera is quite good, chock full of rousing music aided with trumpets and horns, fine arias and even finer duets and terzettos not to mention the famous choruses and had an astounding success with Italian patriots going crazy as soon as they heard ""Viva Italia!""
The production is handsomely staged with great canvases as backdrops, but I wouldn't waste my breath on any ""concept"" or trying to criticise it, because the main thing here is the singing and the conducting. As in all these issues in TUTTO VERDI series the singing is superlative: a great tenor who cuts a fine figure indeed as the hero and copes wonderfully with the difficult high tessitura. The lead baritone is strong yet sensitive in a many shaded performance.
Much was being said about Dimitra Theodossiou by others before me, but she is a great Verdi diva who knows how to handle her voice and certainly moves like a queen. I was also very impressed by the basso supporting roles, especially the larger than life powerhouse of the Emperor Barbarossa.
I am partial to Boris Brott, the conductor as he is from Hamilton, ON, Canada where he put classical music on the map with his tireless efforts in this blue-collar steel town. It's is no mean achievement to be invited to Italy to conduct Verdi and he does a very fine job. His tempi are well judged, his beat precise and the orchestra is superbly responsive. The overture gets a big applause.",1369008000,11,1798,4.744408945686901
8535744,3,B0094AH3PC,"To understand this opera as Verdi wanted it to be staged, one must understand what Italy was going through in 1849 and why Verdi wrote a highly patriotic opera. This was the time of risorgimento, the unification of Italy. Verdi was a staunch patriot, and the opera was intended to be a ""shamelessly patriotic opera"" (Berger, ""Verdi With A Vengeance""). With that in mind, gentle reader, one can see from the outset, that the stage director was totally disconnected from Verdi; he wanted to use Verdi's opera in some allegorical sense to support the defense of art, as reviewer Eitan notes in his insightful analysis.

Well it may be allegorical, but it ain't Verdi, so once again, we, the viewers and, especially, the fans of Verdi are left with less than we might have experienced had Mr. Cappuccio left Verdi's opera to speak for itself, even though the maestro was speaking to a time that is past. Be that as it may, there are some very positive things about the performance that make this disc worth having.

First strength here lies in the male singers: they are all good, with special ""Bravi!!"" to tenor Andrew Richards whom I had not heard before, but of whom I would like to hear more. The same is true of baritone Leonardo Lopez Linares who does a dandy job with the role of Rolando. Even bass Enrico Giuseppe Lori as Frederic Barbarossa has a rich, sonorous voice, and some stage presence.

Dimitra Theodossiu is not loved by all, which must be a burden that all sopranos must endure, judging by my past experiences. I have heard her in very good form and in less than such, and while she starts well, it seems to me that she is really fatigued by the end, which is not surprising, considering the nature of this role.

Chorus and orchestra do a very fine reading of the score, even though the latter, in various modern dress, have been left to line up without adding anything to the drama.

Another quality that I found positive was that of the disc. Picture is great and the DTS sound is awesome. When I first started it, the overture sounded like I was in the middle of the orchestra pit, and as the opera progressed, sound quality allowed precise location of singers and some lovely instrumental detailing.

I share Berger's thought that the opera itself is a ""splendid work"": Verdi had a story about which he was passionate and responded to it with an ""excellent score"". In fact, the opening night was the most rowdy Verdi ever experienced. Because of the historical nature of the story (as written!), the opera has always been more popular in Italy than elsewhere. I hope that you, gentle reader, will not be discouraged by the abysmal staging and will ""take the plunge"" and enjoy this (musically, and in some cases dramatically) ""splendid work"". It may well be the only version forthcoming this bicentennial year.",1363219200,7,2829,4.670682730923695
8535745,3,B0094AH3PC,"There is no way to understand what is going on in this production without having the regisseur Ruggero Cappuccio explain his konzept. However, no such explanation is provided either in the introduction to the opera or in the booklet that comes with the Tutto Verdi box. The explanation was provided on four pages of the program sold to the public who attended the performances in Trieste in 2012, and here is the gist of it: the action is set in a museum warehouse. Art is what builds the cultural identity of a nation. The warehouse is a symbol of the neglect of art. The hope to fight this neglect is symbolized by restorers who touch up large paintings and statues in this museum. The museum is a metaphor of the people and the need for a restoration of our minds. (The implication is that the museum staff who work on restoring the artwork in this regie represent the regisseur who defends the cultural heritage of the nation by reinterpreting old masterpieces like this opera with his ingenious regie, thereby keeping them alive and relevant.) Emperor Federico Barbarossa, who in the opera threatens to destroy Milan, is in this konzept an alien invader who threatens to destroy art by budget cuts and vulgarity. The Battle of Legnano is the battle for the defense of the cultural identity of a people. The regisseur protests in this regie the budget cuts that threaten art, and therefore the cultural identity of the nation. The chorus is dressed in mostly modern raincoats, some in strange head gear; the protagonists in a confusion of styles from various periods. This is because the ""people"" who defend their cultural identity here are any people in any period. After the final curtain falls, the cast is framed immobile in a way that turns the stage into a painting. One of the museum staff crouches in front of it to touch it up, i.e., this opera is part of the cultural heritage of the nation deserving tender love and care just like famous paintings and statues. Capito?

The regisseur was too busy conceiving this inspired regie to work with the actors or the chorus. The chorus therefore mostly just stand like statues and the singers are left to their own devices, acting, if you can call it acting, within a spectrum of operatic postures: from the naturalistic approach of the tenor, to the soprano who clasps her hands in supplication, puts her hand on her heart to emote or her hands on her diaphragm when reaching for a note. But it's all stand and deliver. The lack of directorial guidance is mind boggling - everyone moves on stage with a lack of conviction as if it were a rehearsal and not a well-rehearsed performance. The regie is static, never engaging and distracts from the patriotic focus of the work, but is unobtrusive and operates on a parallel universe to that of the singers. The business with the restoration does not concern the singers and the singers do not concern the museum's staff, which go on with the restoration business oblivious to the opera.

Before this production opened Dimitra Theodossiou carried the highest burden of expectations from this production, being the biggest name in the cast; it was felt that her performance was critical to the success of the entire production (I'm a big fan of hers, btw). Italian TV broadcast her singing the first aria from the dress rehearsal. The clip is on youtube with the announcer's introduction and she sounds pretty good. However, when I first watched this blu-ray I was so alarmed by her delivery of that difficult aria that I gave up on the blu-ray after an hour since I was not impressed with the rest of the cast either. However, I watched clips from the performance on youtube and rather enjoyed them, so I gave this blu-ray a second chance and did find a lot to like. The youtube clips were captured from the audience.  Even with primitive equipment these clips capture the frisson of a live performance in that you can hear even on primitive speakers the effect of the voices projecting into the house and acquiring the overtones and resonance that comes with the hall's acoustic. Baritone Leonardo Lpez Linares for example sounds a lot more resonant in the lower register on youtube clips from the audience, than with the close miking on this blu-ray. Frankly I would have preferred to watch the entire performance on a clip on youtube captured from the audience with primitive equipment rather than experience it from this highly edited and sophisticated blu-ray (that is true for any video for me). But I did return to watch the blu-ray and enjoy it partly by imagining how the singers ""should"" sound inhouse.  The problem in evaluating the singing is that the singers all sound much better on youtube clips captured from the audience, their voices more thrilling, with more impact and authority. But this review is of the blu-ray, not youtube, and here the sound engineering highlights any tiny vocal deficiencies while depriving you of the sense of impact of the voices (this is true of any professionally engineered video).

There is some evidence that Dimitra Theodossiou was not well after the dress rehearsal. Her singing improves in some aspects as the performance progresses, but on the other hand vocal fatigue sets in and by the end she occasionally breaks the line with extra breaths. She confronts all the difficulties of her role, though, with no cheating, no shortcuts, all as written (except for the repeats that the regisseur cut out - allegedly he is responsible for also mutilating the finale to act II). Tenor Andrew Richards has a baritonal timbre and his high notes are forced. He does not have much impassioned Latinate style or tone and by act III vocal fatigue sets in. The only one with no lack of stamina is baritone Leonardo Lpez Linares, whose healthy fortitude serves him well in act III. Bass Enrico Giuseppe Iori is incisive and vigorous in his short appearance as Barbarossa. The pit requires a much more charismatic presence, more rhythmic urgency. I readily admit that a more charitable evaluation of the singing of the entire cast is possible and valid. Video direction by Tiziano Mancini is first-rate as always (no close ups - there is no need for close ups in opera) and the sound is excellent within the usual parameters of sound engineering. This production does not unfortunately make a strong case for this neglected opera. Nor does it make a case against budget cuts - I'd say this regie unintentionally makes a case for even bigger budget cuts, ones that will get rid of those regisseurs who cannot even communicate their message without having to explain it over four pages in the program.",1360022400,20,6640,4.790575916230367
