It went straight into the trash can-30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. May the producers, actors, and writers all die in a fire.",1312761600,,279,4.283018867924528
8070960,1,B000A0D1RO,"This is not footage of real underground fighters!!!

This is a docudrama with bad actors and even worst fighters... all designed to promote their crappy online gambling website, that will never work because the producers were too dumb to realize that the name fight night has already been copyrighted by EA for their videogame.

They interview actual fighters to try and lend it credibility. I wonder if they knew they were interviewed for something fake. They must have just paid these people.

Seriously, don't waste your time on this. I wish I would have read the other review before I brought this on some other website.",1176768000,,624,4.867924528301887
8070961,4,B000A0D1RO,"I am a fan of UFC style fighting and I thought the film did a good job in presenting that.  After reading other reviews pro an con about the film, I think the filmmaker did a good job in portraying what really happens in these fights.  I still think that this could be real, who knows.  I think the fights could have been a bit more action packed, but I have seen my fare share of boring MMA fights.  Blood does flow in a few of the fights.  I think what they were trying to is put more focus on the fighters lives, than the fights themselves and show it's not all glamorous.

Overall I give this a thumbs up and it is a very quick watch.",1137801600,2,638,3.984251968503937
8070962,1,B000A0D1RO,"This is a fake documentary that's actually a scripted movie using professional actors.

It purports to follow a couple of 'underground fighters' who take part in no-holds barred tournaments that are produced by the owners of an internet gambling website.  Interviews with people involved in boxing, including Larry Holmes and Bert Sugar, are interspersed with the scripted 'fake' parts of this film in an attempt to fool the audience into thinking this is the real deal.

However, the actors soon give away the secret; especially the supposed 16-year old street kid whose good looks, perfect teeth, and obviously scripted stream-of-conciousness dialogue make it apparent that this is not an actual documentary.

At the end, as the credits roll, it is finally acknowledged that this is fake.

I don't have a very high opinion of this movie.  The fighting is boring, barely visible due to the near-dark conditions under which it was filmed, and unrealistic (no weight classes and no gloves, just to name two obvious giveaways).  The dialogue does nothing to enlighten us, only bore us with its banality.  In short, the purpose of this movie is to deceive the audience, then shout, ""A-Ha!!!"" at the end.  A movie that aims to make its audience feel like fools isn't enjoyable to watch.",1134950400,5,1282,5.009433962264151
