7542533,1,B0189HP0DC,"For anyone who appreciates the high quality we got from the CBS release of season 1, this VEI release of the entire series will be a major let-down (dare I say ripoff?). I had high expectations based on the previous season 1 release and really looked forward to having the entire series in the same high quality. Alas, this was not to be. Here's the deal. Most episodes in seasons 2 thru 8 in this package are EDITED for time. They are apparently syndication prints that have been cut to about 46 minutes. The original length was approximately 50 minutes. If that isn't bad enough, seasons 2 thru 8 are also very poor quality. The video is less-than-sharp (several generations away from the masters), with lots of flaws and the audio quality is mediocre at best. Apparently little or no effort was made to obtain decent copies from CBS or do any remastering whatsoever. It should be noted that season 1 in this set appears to be from the same source material as the previous CBS release. So, what you get is season 1 in excellent, full-length quality (same as the CBS release), and seasons 2 thru 8 barely better than what you might obtain from an off-the-air VCR recording of syndicated, edited episodes. As others have said, this will likely be the only way we will get this series but in my opinion, the price is too high for what we get. Buyer beware.",1450742400,25,1355,4.53469387755102
7542534,2,B0189HP0DC,"I concur with other posts about this set. CBS / VEI logo on packaging should mean quality, but not so. They obviously were looking to make a quick buck off of the release before Christmas, without going through the effort of remastering the set. Too bad.",1450396800,8,254,4.543478260869565
7542535,4,B0189HP0DC,"I've been waiting for this release for years, so I was very happy that somebody finally got the rights and did. I like many others was a little disappointed by the quality, but once I started watching it wasn't so bad for viewing. The cost of restoring would have drove the price up, and the bottom line is I wanted to see this show, so I got my wish. The cost is not too bad considering the price of other QM Productions. The Streets of San Francisco is only 5 seasons and goes for about $250, while The Fbi (9 seasons) could cost you around $500. They've been holding their value for years. I see the price dropping on this one soon, like The Mod Squad which released at this price, but soon afterward Amazon was giving them away for around $80. I like the packaging, made for ease of watching. To bad no cc though, now if they'd only release Dan August!",1450396800,6,856,4.257668711656442
7542536,1,B0189HP0DC,"I'm sooooo disappointed!  These are edited episodes.  Season 2 through Season 8 are any where between 46 minutes to 51 minutes.  Most between 46 to 48 minutes.  The quality is questionable for Season 2 -8.  I'd grade them between a B and a C grade. Both grades in the same season.  You know the part of the episode that shows on the screen and says ""Barnaby Jones Act I, ""Barnaby Jones Act II, etc. etc.  Well, there are episodes where that part is completely missing.  There is no act I, act II, act III or act IV.  Someone edited that out.  I purchased directly from VEI so I can't get a refund. If I had order from Amazon I probably could have gotten a refund.  And I would have sent it back for a refund.  I spent $150.00 dollars for this set that's worth about $75.00 at the most. There are pro's and con's...

Pro's:
1)Season 1 is excellent quality and all 13 episodes are 51 minutes long. Must be the original Season 1 that was released years ago.
2) All seasons are individually wrapped in this collection box.  There are 8 jewel cases (one per season). So, you could sell season 8 on it's own  if you didn't want it or didn't like it.
3) Nice collector box to hold all seasons.

Con's
1) Edited episodes on Season 2 through season 8. Most are 46 to 48 minutes.  They should be 51 minutes each.
2) Quality with Season 2 through Season 8 are less than expected (grade B and some grade C ). If they were all grade B it wouldn't be so bad. But, I would still be disappointed.
3) Season 2 through Season 8, each season holds all discs in one jewel case.  But, to get to disc 2 you have to remove disc 1. Disc 3 and 4 are ok.  You have to remove disc 5 to get to disc 6.  How much did VEI save on this? (eyes rolling) I need an emoticon!

Since there are 8 jewel cases in this collectors set each season could have sold separately. If I had purchased Season 2 and realized they were edited episodes and the quality wasn't as good as Season 1, I might not have purchased Season 3.
  Whether or not to purchase this? To each their own. If you can live with the pro's and con's...then go for it. Knowing what I know now, I would have waiting for my library to purchase it.  By the way, my library is now purchasing it.  I should have been a little more patient.",1450310400,56,2261,4.1307339449541285
7542537,3,B0189HP0DC,"Will wait for the price to drop by half.  On hometheaterforum.com, everyone is posting that many of the episodes are edited, syndicated versions and no re-mastering has been done.  Too bad CBS couldn't stick with it and release the whole series the right way like Mannix, Mission Impossible, etc.",1450310400,3,296,5.020408163265306
7542538,4,B0189HP0DC,"Pre-ordered this set directly from VEI and received on 12/15.  Packaging is compact (no spindles, just standard DVD boxes --- one for each season --- encased in a sturdy flip-top box as indicated in the product photo.)  Happy to have this set, but of course there are issues with Seasons 2 - 8, the seasons CBS never got around to re-mastering before abandoning plans to release the entire series themselves.  If you were to catch a mid-80's late night syndication run of the show on a local network, this probably best reflects how seasons 2 - 8 look and sound in this set.  Second or third generation prints with degraded focus and color peppered with artifacts (dust, scratches, etc.)  The audio takes a hit too on these prints --- a bit murky and tinny and all mid-range.  We wouldn't have noticed or cared on a two inch 1984 TV speaker, but the inadequacies really stand out today --- especially when compared to the lovely sound that accompanies all season one episodes.  Far more troubling though, is the probability that most of these episodes have been trimmed for syndication.  To be honest, I've only seen a few episodes from this massive set, but each one had fade-in and outs for commercial inserts where none originally existed, and the QM trademark ""Act I, Act II"" inserts have been removed entirely in at least two of the episodes I've seen.  Bottom line is that none of this should keep any fan from purchasing the set since we'll likely never have access to it in any other format, but potential buyers need to brace themselves for disappointment in terms of overall quality and content.",1450310400,124,1605,4.703571428571428
7542539,1,B0189HP0DC,"The show is a classic and great show!  But for VEI to give us edited episodes is a big thumbs down. The picture quality for the show is decent. It is too bad that VEI can't get these releases right. The Hotel release was a nightmare with awful, dreadful picture quality and now Barnaby has edited episodes. Shame on VEI for this treatment of classic TV. I give the show 5 stars but the release by VEI gets 1 star.",1450224000,36,413,4.1625

7542541,4,B0189HP0DC,"yah the DVD quality is bad but the show is great. I love this show, great 70's cheesy campy style drama show. With Barnaby it's always the same plot, a disagreement breaks out in the beginning then one guy is pushed by accident and dies, then they try to cover it up, Barnaby in his ""ah sucks"" style mopes around and in the end gets the bad guy, the bad guy takes a shot at Barnaby and always misses then Barnaby fires one shot back and hits the guy in the arm or the leg...its so classic camp!
The DVD quality is ok to not ok. A lot of the DVD's look as if they were recorded off a VCR and many are edited down to 46 mins when the show back then was a good 50-51 mins. Still its all you got so with that in mind I like the show and glad i bough the set. Although I am sure this time next year the set will be half the price or lower",1449964800,8,833,3.7657142857142856

To watch the cases unfold is just sheer brilliance and it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout each episode.  I was amazed at how good this series is and it brings back memories from decades ago when it first aired on television. If you have never seen the series, I would challenge you to tune in and see for yourself just how great the golden age of television really was back then.  I'm glad I decided to purchase the entire series and I can't stress enough how great this collection is.  It was a 5-star series when it was originally done and it is still a 5-star series today.

and the price was good but the rest of the seasons are too high. It's absurd. I saw this collection and 50.00 for the entire series seems like
a good price so I may get this soon. I read the other seasons were not digitally remasters to full episodes so the prices are not worth it.
But Barnaby Jones was and still is one of my favorite shows and better than any garbage on TV today and I still watch over and over.",1518220800,3,554,3.8684210526315788
7542616,4,B0189HP0DC,"I had already purchased seasons 1-2, but when I saw the great price for the entire series I decided to purchase the remaining seasons at once.  I've just completed watching season five and have not yet started season six.  I've really been enjoying watching these episodes, particularly interesting for me is seeing who the guest stars are in the various episodes, some were the usual suspects who showed up as guest stars on various shows of the era and some who were up and comers at the time.  The stories themselves all follow the same formula - a crime is committed (usually a robbery or murder) and Barnaby played by Buddy Ebsen is called in either by Meridean Insurance or a relative or friend of the victim to investigate what happened.  There is at least one murder in each episode and usually a second one to cover up the first one.  We know who the villain is, so we get to watch Barnaby figure it out.  In the first four seasons, Barnaby is assisted by his daughter-in-law and secretary, Betty Jones, played by Lee Meriwether.  In the fifth season. Mark Shera as Barnaby's nephew J. R. Jones joins the series.  Barnaby also works with  Los Angeles Police Lieutenant John Dibble who is played by John Carter.  The one disappointment I have with this release is that the episodes were not re-mastered and are the syndicated versions and not original uncut episodes.  For the most part that is okay, but there are times you can tell there is a scene missing and many of the episodes end abruptly.  I have noticed a change in the fifth season though, the episodes are still the syndicated versions, but they are not trimmed as much, probably because the original running time had shortened by that time.  I would still recommend this release to anyone who remembers watching the series in the 1970's or for anyone who is interested in watching a typical detective series from that era.",1518134400,6,1893,4.648648648648648

7542618,4,B0189HP0DC,"Nice series. However, I am annoyed with the way many of these complete series such as this one are packaged.  The case is very hard to open and looking through the disks stacked in this way is very annoying. I prefer the small individual cases with 2 disks in each one.  I'm sure it is all about cost saving.

7542621,4,B0189HP0DC,"I have to say that I've been pleasantly surprised with the DVDs.  I will agree, that after season 1, the quality of the editing wasn't as good.  However, the quality of the picture isn't nearly as terrible as what I have read in the reviews.  The fact that the ""Acts"" portion is removed in some 2-8 episodes  is hardly concerning.  Yeah, I would have liked it to be there for the sake of completeness, but don't let it be a deal breaker if you want to buy this.  Considering that this is the only way to get all 8 seasons, I would recommend buying it right away if you are a huge Barnaby Jones fan.",1516924800,6,598,4.156521739130435

Now, that I am an adult, and part of my job is to investigate the facts, I realize that this show and other investigator shows that I watched express the importance of paying attention to details.  Barnaby was able to solve crimes because he had a sharp mind, great wit, and investigated every little detail.  Very little slipped past him.  Supposedly minor things, like a small piece of glass on the floor or a single strand of hair in on a car seat fit into a greater puzzle.

7542676,5,B0189HP0DC,"If you love Barnaby Jones, get this set!  If you are on the fence because of some of the negative comments or reviews, my advice is to get this set!  It is true that the video quality is not great except for the first season.  The video quality varies a lot but none of them are horrible.  If you grew up in the 80s or before, you have seen TV like this before and it's not going to kill you. Personally, it is nostalgic for me.  It's true many of these episodes are very obviously edited.  Some of the endings are very abruptly ended and are missing the folksy recap at the end that the episodes should have.  HOWEVER, none of this in my opinion is going to keep you from enjoying the show or wanting the set.  There is a lot more there than isn't there, after all.  Some of the discs are a little glitchy, and I have a couple that were very glitchy that I am going to get replaced by the manufacturer.  They have instructions on how to contact them should you need a replacement disc.

CBS only released the first season of this show, and then nothing.  So I am very glad to have the whole series and am thoroughly enjoying it.  So, unless you are a total nitpicker who expects everything in life exactly how you want it, and looking perfect on your 10 x 10 foot HD TV no less, if you love Barnaby and love watching him laconically solve crimes and order milk in bars, get this and enjoy!",1494633600,3,1390,4.1610486891385765

The chemistry among the characters is good and I like that they use the same character actors in different roles early in their careers.  When Mark Shera joined the series in season five, it added a new dimension and became even better.  I have read the reviews that claimed it was for older people when it was originally published and that may be true but it stands the test of time for the same exact reason.  If you enjoy Matlock and/or Diagnosis Murder, you'll like this.  I read the condition issues some have written about but I think it must be their machines.

7542725,4,B0189HP0DC,"Buddy Ebsen as Barnaby Jones was one of a number of stellar actors known for their roles in comedy series in their earlier careers, that went on to become crime fighters in their later years. Known as the patriarch, Jed Clampett, on Beverly Hillbillies, he then went on to star as Barnaby Jones for another 8 years.
Other famous actors were Andy Griffith as Sheriff Andy Taylor on The Andy Griffith show, starred as Ben Matlock, an attorney for another 9 years.
Then there was Jack Klugman, who played Oscar on The Odd Couple, went on to become Dr R Quincy, M.E. for another 8 years.
Dick Van Dyke, after his own sitcom with Mary Tyler Moore, went on to become Dr Mark Sloan in Diagnosis Murder for another 8 seasons.
Tom Bosley, father in Happy Days went on to become Father Dowling in Father Dowling Mysteries for another 3 years.
Robert Young as Jim Anderson on Father Knows Best, became Marcus Welby, M.D. for another 7 years.
And last but not least, Peter Falk, who had comedic roles in films such as The In-laws, was probably the most famous crime solver of all, as homicide detective Columbo, for over 10 years. He originally started with dark brown hair, that slowly became more grey in the later seasons.
As for myself, now that I am a senior, as I look in the mirror, I notice a few more grey/silver hairs every day, as for my heroics, they still come every once in awhile  on the tennis courts,

Now for The Barnaby Jones box set: -
This is a fairly good interesting series, if you are a fan of Columbo, you will enjoy this set. These are clever crime stories, usually set up in the opening of the show, similar to Columbo.  One major difference is in the conclusion of the episodes, Columbo usually caught the culprit and solved the crime in the last 2 minutes of each show, Barnaby Jones usually captures the culprit in the last 2 minutes, but they usually try to shoot him and he often ends up shooting them instead, but in the arm.
If you don't want to purchase the whole set, you can get individual seasons, they sell for around $30 each. Season 1 has the best video, remastered, but there are only 13 episodes. Seasons 2 -8 average 24 episodes each, and the picture quality, though not  remastered, is definitely quite acceptable ( much better than the recent release of Star Trek, The Next Genereation), however, most of the episodes are edited, they clock in at around 46 minutes each, about 4  5 minutes are missing, the beginnings of Act 1 thru Act 4 , a Quinn Martin trademark, are not there. As Buddy Ebsen began to age, Mark Shera as J.R. was introduced as a regular character in season 5, so his role began to reduce. So if you're in this series mainly for Buddy Ebsen, then the first 4 seasons would be considered to be the best.",1471737600,4,2755,4.436758893280633
7542726,3,B0189HP0DC,"Barnaby Jones had the ""one lieutenant rule."" This was a rule in cop and lawyer shows where one, and only one, lieutenant on the Los Angeles Police Department was at every crime scene.  He was also the lieutenant who knew everything. On Perry Mason it was Lieutenant Tragg.  On Peter Gunn it was Lieutenant Jacoby. On Barnaby Jones it was Lieutenant Biddle. Every crime on Barnaby Jones had Lt. John Biddle on the scene, apparently the only plainclothes officer on the entire force in a city of 3 million. Barnaby Jones stuck to formula more than Coca Cola. It was a relentlessly silly and predictable show that worked in the early years and flopped badly as it stumbled to its conclusion in 1980. In the beginning the show was entirely based around the likeable milk-drinking Buddy Ebsen gumshoe. The early shows had great plots, good production values, notable guest stars, great 1970s looks (big cars, big hair, big attitudes), and an inkling of plausibility. Ebsen was a great actor, and somehow he made the formula work. Ebsen had an innate,sly good-old-boy intelligence that made you think he could actually take down young bucks 1/3 his age. As the show wore on, Ebsen reduced his work load and often only made a cameo appearance, leaving the show to ""co-stars"" Mark Shera and Lee Meriwether. Unfortunately, they didn't have the chops to carry the show. The show became cheesier, the writing suffered badly, and the ""special guest stars"" were actors you never heard of. The later shows often featured Ebsen's daughter Bonnie Ebsen, an attractive blonde who had a very interesting hillbilly/Valley Girl way of speaking. As for the picture quality, I actually think the scratchy prints help the show, makes you think you're watching Barnaby late at night on a UHF station with bad rabbit years--the way it should be watched.",1471305600,3,1828,4.893548387096774

As stated in other reviews, most of the episodes after season 1 are incomplete andhave not been remastered. There are a few scattered episodes that are complete after season 1, but they are few and far between. All of the other Quinn Martin shows I have are near perfect. I believe The Fugitive had some music issues, but there was nothing major that I noticed with those shows. Cannon was well done, and my favoirte of the bunch,  The FBI looked great to me. All of them had the ACT I,II ect. as the each new chapter started. It bothered me a lot how most of them were not included in the episodes of Barnaby Jones. You could also see where some scenes faded out that should have kept going. As stated in other posts, the episodes after season 1 run about 46 minutes. About 5 minutes have been cut. I cannot believe that VEI could get away with releasing this series and acting like it is complete when it's not. They are cut episodes. In the end, I am still happy to have the set, but I hope another company will release the complete uncut epsodes as it deserves.",1461801600,2,1153,4.2889908256880735

7542754,4,B0189HP0DC,"Finally thanks to VEI we get the classic 8 seasons of Barnaby Jones. I read many of the reviews and the complaint that keeps coming through is picture quality. Now it is true that the videos were not cleaned up and remastered to HD specs. But come on folks, it is better than what we saw during its original run on vhf and reruns on UHF.  I am satisfied with quality of picture. It was a show that began some 43 years ago. We are lucky the VEI got the rights to release. I can't imagine it will be blockbuster sales. After all there are only so many smart people like us who can appreciate this show lol. The only thing I don't like is that some some episodes are slightly edited. They didn't cut it from 51 to 43 minutes. That would have driven me nuts but some might be 48 minutes. Not a deal breaker. To sum it up I expect a show made in the 70s to look that way. As long as it doesn't look worse I am happy and if it looks better I consider that a bonus!!!
If you are a Quiinn Martin Production fan you will love Barnaby Jones and this VEI complete series collection. 4 stars!!!",1458345600,32,1082,4.05607476635514

This is a company that is supposed to EXCEL in releasing TV DVDS and they put out bad copies of every TV show they release . I am on season 2 and I see a big difference from Season 1 which was released by SONY and very clear. QUESTION IS IF SONY CAN DO WHY CANT VEI?????????  I had ordered Hotel as well and had to send it back because it was totally unwatchable at least this is watchable but if you watch it on a large HD TV you will be disappointed.,1456099200,3,638,3.984375
7542759,5,B0189HP0DC,"To all the people complaining about this set, I say ""STOP IT"". I got mine last week and this show is one of the most bootlegged shows ever and these episodes are clear enough to watch and it is the ONLY place you will get the entire run of the show, many places sell 100 or 125 of the episodes in varying quality and most from TV channels like WWOR or SKY TV or other cable destinations but these shows do have cut episodes but you don't miss much of the plot and I LOVE Barnaby as I watched all the episodes as they came on CBS in the 70's when I was young. Cannon, Streets of San Fransisco, Harry-O, Mannix, Hawaii Five-O and so many other great shows I collect are all available for us to collect on DVD in complete sets now. This set of Barnaby is probably the only complete set we are going to get. Mark Shera and Lee Merriweather (almost 80 now) campaigned tirelessly to get this set out to the public. I wish they had not chopped up some of the episodes like Marathon Murders is missing almost 5 minutes of footage (glad I have my original WWOR broadcast) but where else will you find these great episodes in decent quality? When Barnaby was filmed no one knew we would all have 55 to 90 inch TV screen as big as theaters to look at the episodes on. Looking forward to VEI releasing (according to the brochure inside the package) Martial Law, Petrocelli, Matt Houston and a few other shows I already have TV copies of but looking forward to those and more DVD. My advice: Stop complaining and enjoy what we do have which is a COMPLETE run of Barnaby Jones which we cannot find anywhere else, legally at least. The picture quality looks good enough on my 46 inch Sony Bravia and my 55 inch LG as well as my 42 in Samsung TV's. Just enjoy Barnaby please, then watch Cannon and Hawaii Five-O like I used to watch back to back to back before the Jefferson's and Sanford and Son then Good Times came on. Those were the days.",1456099200,9,1926,4.236413043478261
7542760,4,B0189HP0DC,"I was on the ""fence"" deciding whether to order or not due to the editing and quality concerns that other reviewers have stated. While the ""defects"" are there I am convinced that many of  the negative reactions are due to technically superior playback and television equipment and perfectionist expectations that many viewers have today in comparison with other classic television DVD sets that have been re-mastered and sold. After re-watching the same re-mastered first season episodes for six years I decided to order the set and I am so glad that I did! The editing is not as abrupt as reviewers have stated and the quality is surprisingly good considering the age of the programs along with the before-mentioned lack of re-mastering. It has been a blast going back in time to the 70s (with large gas-gulping cars driving past Tower Records stores) enjoying these shows and remembering when I would watch these episodes with my dad! It's all here-long 70s hair styles, Betty not ""getting"" what Barnaby is doing, milk drinking in bars, etc. When you add in all the classic 70s guest stars that were part of the show along with the fact this is probably the only way that you can get the rest of Barnaby Jones past the first season it's a no-brainer!

It's obvious that they have been cut because most of the episodes don't even have the Act 1, Epilog, etc., headings that are typical of Quinn Martin productions.  I have the Cannon series, which is also put out by VEI, and the episodes in this series are intact.  As one reviewer mentioned, the first season is fine, but Seasons 2-8 have mostly shorter episodes (46 minutes instead of 50-51).  I am so disappointed because I love this series.  What a shoddy production!  Rating for series:  3 1/2 stars; for production:  1/2 star.",1451347200,9,765,4.641791044776119
7542772,5,B0189HP0DC,"First off. I love HD quality. BUT I have waited so long for this series that I accept the lower video quality. I am just so happy to have complete set. My only complaint is that for the lower quality the price should have been less. But when you have so much demand and the sellers know they can sell it for a certain price, they could care less what it is actually worth. I wouldn't sell it back for a complete refund so that tells me I must love it!",1451347200,10,451,3.967032967032967
7542773,1,B0189HP0DC,With so many negative reviews I will not even open up the box.  I don't mind paying the high price but I do expect a high quality product for the money. Will demand a return as soon as possible.,1451260800,11,194,3.9743589743589745
7542774,5,B0189HP0DC,"For all those giving this set a bad or questionable review all I can say is I am glad to finally have all the episodes.  Some people don't like it so far because it might be missing 2-3 minutes from the original show or the video quality isn't picture perfect.  But few things in this world are perfect and I for one am darn glad I have all the episodes now.  I am not going to worry about 2-3 minutes here and there and as far as the video and audio are concerned they are absolutely fine with me.  Great job VEI, much appreciated!  5 Stars for this one.",1451260800,9,555,4.055045871559633
7542775,4,B0189HP0DC,"I wish the quality was better--I took a star off because of it--but even the worst, shortened episodes look better than they did on the rabbit-eared TV of my youth. And while the set may not be perfect, the memories it brings back are perfect: memories of when all my family was alive and together, when we gathered around the TV--every one of us--to watch Barnaby Jones. And the show is just as good as I remember. Maybe even better. I feel lucky to have it. I thought after CBS went out of the DVD business, it would never see the light of day.

The big question is: Am I so spoiled that I can't enjoy a show without pristine picture quality? No. I'm having a blast sharing adventures with Barnaby Jones again.

I hope you can, too.",1451260800,8,734,4.311594202898551
7542776,3,B0189HP0DC,"I agree with what has been posted so far.  However, in Season 2, there are many top quality, full-length episodes.  ""Death Leap,"" ""The Black Art of Dying,"" ""Fatal Flight,"" ""The Secret of the Dunes,"" ""The Deadly Jinx,"" ""The Platinum Connection,"" ""Gold Record for Murder,"" and ""Foul Play"" all have excellent color--and are full-length episodes (except for the previews).  I have discovered only two other full-length episodes:  ""The Deadly Conspiracy"" and ""Beware the Dog,"" from Season 4.  The color, on these episodes, is also fantastic.  These full-length episodes are so enjoyable and don't feel as rushed and choppy as the edited versions.  I also enjoy the location filming and gorgeous background music.  Still, I am glad to have the entire series (plus the one Cannon episode.)",1451174400,8,782,5.2
7542777,1,B0189HP0DC,"I have watched about eight episodes so far and can concur with the negative reviews below. These are a mix of uncut episodes and poorly edited syndication versions. I expected so much more after the brilliant season one DVD set, but the video quality is only marginally better than YouTube uploads of VHS rips. Pretty shocking sticker price for this subpar quality, but here's a tip: if you squint your eyes for 46 minutes (or sometimes 51) the picture looks a lot clearer.",1451001600,23,473,4.710843373493976
7542778,1,B0189HP0DC,"I will not dwell on details but will agree with what others have said: the transfers of seasons 2-8 are awful. They look as they were made from syndication 16mm masters. They look pale and washed out.  The act title headers (act 1, act 2) have been eliminated probably in order to give the syndicating stations the ability to add more commercial breaks which would make the act numbering confusing.

The only exception is season 1 which is essentially a repressing of the set released a few years ago by Paramount. These episodes were remastered and look very good. The other exception is the ""The Deadly Conspiracy"" two part crossover with CANNON. These two episodes look just as good as the episodes from season 1, and the Cannon episode looks better than the same one included on the CANNON complete set from VEI.",1450828800,66,816,4.699300699300699
7542779,4,B0189HP0DC,All things considered I am pleased with my purchase. The editing I believe was unnecessary but not too extreme. I am watching the DVDs on a recently purchased 60 inch flat screen and the picture and sound quality is above average but not perfect. Since I wanted and waited so long for this series I feel I got my money's worth. Any true Barnaby Jones fanatic will not consider reselling these tapes. After all this is as good as it gets.,1450828800,17,437,4.407407407407407

7542781,1,B0189HP0DC,"What a shame. Season One is the same set released by CBS back in 2010, so the quality is great. The remaining seasons however are another matter. All are from syndication prints taken from 16mm film, and look terrible. Some are edited to 46 minutes! I do not hold VEI responsible, they are relaesing what's given to them. However, CBS should have provided the braodcast originals and not syndication prints. At any rate, VEI should have made note that some episodes are edited. I for one would have waited till the price dropped before buying. This set is not worth more than $80.00!!!",1450742400,10,585,4.689320388349515

8741785,5,B0189HP0DC,"As many reviewers' have said,the picture quality isn't the sharpest. But the story lines and acting are great. I always loved the 1970's television shows because they have an appeal of class,excitement and just great all around entertainment. So if anyone is looking for an HD quality picture because they have a super large screen or one of the newer televisions with extra features,this set is probably not for you. But if you are someone who is looking for a great television series,with 1970's era cars ,clothing and middle class lifestyle with great story lines also,then you will love watching Barnaby Jones .Quinn Martin made alot of great programs like Cannon,Streets of San Francisco. I also love many other cop shows of the 70's like,Police Woman,Kojak,Starsky & Hutch,The Rookies,Baretta just to name a few. This was a great era for television,music and motion pictures,and rock concerts,and clothing too. I feel very lucky to have grown up in an era of such great culture. Unless you are looking for perfection ,you will have a hard time not wanting to watch the next episode.",1529539200,,1088,4.983516483516484

8741787,1,B0189HP0DC,"I love this TV show I am a huge fan, but I had to return it. I can list cons only, here they are:
1) first season is the only remastered season. the rest 7 seems to be copied directly from VHS. Quality is very poor.
2) first season is the only season with subtitles. the rest 7 have no subtitles nor cc.
3) sound quality on those free or remastering and subtitles seasons is very poor. I hardly can hear what they are talking about.
3) my set arrived with unplayable discs.

I guess I will keep mine individually purchased first season and wait for a better edition.",1527120000,,566,4.192660550458716
