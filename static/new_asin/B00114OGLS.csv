8240314,1,B00114OGLS,"Although the product description does not list this information, the DVD, once it arrived, was created for DVD Region 2 (Europe) and is in PAL (not NTSC) format.  This means that it may be difficult to play on U.S. DVD players unless they are modified for Region 9 (accept any region DVD code) and can handle the European TV format.

Seller Moviemars replied to my email on this issue that they do not author the Amazon.com product description for this DVD.

I would highly recommend before purchasing this DVD title in the U.S. to check your video equipment first.  If your DVD player is hard-set for Region 1 and your TV is NTSC, not PAL, you will probably not be able to view it.

Gave this a one-star rating not as reflection of the content, but to mark it as an item that will generate an return to seller (if they will take it back at all) if you are not aware of the DVD's specs due to this information not included in the listing.",1259798400,3,938,4.337142857142857
