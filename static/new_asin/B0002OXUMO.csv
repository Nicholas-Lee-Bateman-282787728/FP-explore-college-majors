8030010,5,B0002OXUMO,"My 17 month old daughter is a HUGE Barney fan!  We watch his show every day on PBS.  We have 2 other Barney DVD's besides this one -- and this is her favorite one by a mile.  It is ""new Barney"" as stated by another reviewer -- and we love that!  I think she loves it so much because she recognizes the children from the daily PBS show.  This DVD is packed with catchy songs about healthy eating and exercising -- who can argue with that?",1112572800,3,437,4.034883720930233
8030011,1,B0002OXUMO,"I just bought this at Target and I can't even watch it.  My almost 2 year old LOVES his other Barney tape, so I thought this would be a good one....WRONG.  This is the ""new"" Barney and, if you ask me, it stinks!  My kid lost interest in 5 minutes which NEVER happens with his other tape that he's watched probably a hundred times!!",1108857600,2,331,4.140625
