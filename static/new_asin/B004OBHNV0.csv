With a fervent belief ""luck"" would stand by him. I'm old,but I don't recall young ladies being as forward as the tarts in this series. Maybe I simply mixed with the wrong mob?",1340668800,,308,4.237288135593221
8437054,5,B004OBHNV0,"I really loved this piece, it was beautifully done, particular to the aging process of Logan Mountstuart. Watching him go through the decades and women of his life; the times he lived in at any moment was quite thought provoking. I especially loved that it is not a candy coated piece but one in which real life tragedy and loss appears throughout his life. Many pieces made today are all about happy endings and everyone getting what they want and I felt this piece was truly done as a real life film full of real life events. Very few people live flawless lives without disappointment and loss, and no one escapes alive much less without watching themselves grow Old. Wonderful!",1303430400,3,680,4.675
