The extensive use of SD [super deformation, aka chibi] makes it laugh out loud hilarious! Also, the  storyline is so deep, you'll be waiting to find out what happens next, even  after seeing only one episode! The characters are funny, and they have deep  personalities, unlike many animes which leave you with boring characters.
If you've read the Magic Knights Rayearth manga, you may be a little  disappointed. The anime keeps the same basic storyline, but there are many  changes, and the anime is more drawn out. The music is excellent as well. I  love the openning song. The ending song is also great, but not as good as  the opening song.
Overall, Magic Knights Rayearth is an extraordinary  anime. I would recommend it to children as well as adults!",961459200,2,876,4.754966887417218

My favorite part is where Ferio tells the three girls, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu that he  likes Fuu best and she is so embarresed she is on fire. Any anime lover  will imediatly, if not sooner, become adicted to this wonderful Anime!",949622400,2,367,4.53030303030303
