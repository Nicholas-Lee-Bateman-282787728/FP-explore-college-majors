8507076,4,B006ZL1PR0,"Great set of movies and a great price, well worth the price. Now if your lucky enough to get what you pay for, quality not being a part of Amazons list of things to care about. Far too many things movies mostly aren't whatever say, most new are usually damaged or just plain used, not new. False advertising.",1432080000,,308,4.327586206896552
8507077,5,B006ZL1PR0,"You get SIX classic horror movies in one pack.  It's Blu-Ray, so you're seeing it in theatre quality and sound.  I love it and it makes for a great ""I can't sleep"" night viewing.  You're sure to be awake the rest of the night, if not week!!",1402012800,,240,4.0638297872340425
8507078,5,B006ZL1PR0,"this collection has some weird movies, I got it for a great price, if you buy these single, you're paying at least 5 times more than you pay on here.",1384819200,,149,4.0
8507079,3,B006ZL1PR0,"Im particularly talking about  ""Cursed"" from this set. As far as the movie itself it is the PG-13 Theatrical Version rather than the Unrated version, of which i was hoping for. So that drops one star for me as I prefer unrated or extended versions over their original counterparts. Now as Far as the sound quality goes, the action sequences had plenty of loud scares through the rear speakers but the dialogue throughout the movie was mostly muffled. Having to raise and lower the volume level constantly from beginning to end was quite a nuasance. Hopefully ""Cursed"" will recieve an offical u.s. unrated version in the near future.",1344902400,3,632,4.851851851851852
8507080,5,B006ZL1PR0,"I was a little worried to get this set because I did not know what quality it would be. Glad I took the risk! This is a two disc set with three movies on one side of each disc (no flippers!!). I wasn't expecting the greatest quality with three movies crammed onto one blu ray disc, but these are actually pretty good looking transfers with excellent surround sound on most features (I haven't looked at Halloween or Hellraiser). I am so happy to FINALLY see Phantoms get an anamorphic widescreen release (and its HD!) because the DVD looked horrible by comparison (still has softness and grain, but looks to be intentional). These are the theatrical cuts and not the ""unrated"" versions, but at this price who can complain? I was hoping that The Faculty and Teaching Mrs. Pringle were included instead of Hellraiser 32 and Halloween 43 (lol). But four of these titles are worth the price of about 15 bucks or so. These are all from the Miramax vaults via Echo Bridge (who seems to be releasing Miramax films onto plain, no special features, blu rays). For the cheap prices Echo Bridge is charging, these aren't that bad. just glad to see Miramax movies getting released on blu ray like the ones in this collection. Well worth the money. Hope other studios follow this one. Six movies for a reasonable cheap price on a great format.
The films included are: Disc One- Halloween Curse of Michael Myers, Hellraiser Hellseeker, Cursed.
Disc Two- Darkness, Phantoms, Venom.
All in glorious 1080p!",1344643200,2,1489,4.730769230769231
