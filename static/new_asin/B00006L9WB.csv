1784213,3,B00006L9WB,I bought this movie thinking it was going to be a romantic comedy.  It turned out that the boss is trying to seduce every girl in sight even though he is married.  His employee is trying to please him all the time.  I just didn't like the movie,1367625600,,244,4.041666666666667
1784214,4,B00006L9WB,"As with most Hindi movies there is a lot of music & dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix). This is a feel-good romantic comedy movie.
 I have not had the DVD long but I use it a lot because I watch this and other movies alternately every day sometimes more than once a day. I recommend the movie to everyone.",1361491200,2,307,4.032786885245901
1784215,2,B00006L9WB,"Again I find these old SRK films to be stupid, but as a SRK fan I want to watch all his films,  My favorite forever is Rab ne bana di Jodi and My Name is khan",1358899200,,158,3.388888888888889
1784216,5,B00006L9WB,"I find enjoyment in Shah Rukh Khan's movies and I decided to buy some of his older ones since I couldn't rent them anytime soon on Netflix. I bought this one cause the story line sounded nice enough and the price was right. What I found was one sweet jem of a movie. Instantly fell in love with some of the songs even though - MAJOR BUMMER - my copy doesn't include English subtitles for the songs. La sigh! Mercifully, I found some kind soul had put some of the songs on youtube with English subtitles, which really helped me say for SURE that I LOVE THIS MOVIE and its songs! I mean, without the songs meanings, it is an incomplete movie in Bollywood.",1326758400,3,653,4.274193548387097
1784217,5,B00006L9WB,"This is one of the first Bollywood films I ever saw, and was helpful in getting me hooked. It is very funny, and silly (in a good way).  You will love it.",1324944000,,154,3.8125
1784218,5,B00006L9WB,"What more can I say - sure, the plot is very simple.  Sure, there it is corny.  Sure, it is not the most clever nor the most sophisticated movie ever produced in Bollywood.  However, if you like to enjoy a couple of hours with 2 of Bollywood's finest actors (I know that some might dispute that claim - however, what a great acting duo they are!), then watch ""Yes Boss"".  I like SRK and I think that he excelled in movies like this (Duplicate and Baadshah also come to mind.  I highly recommend this movie - an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours especially after a long week of work.",1299888000,,592,4.25
1784219,5,B00006L9WB,"I absolutely loved it!! My expectations were very low when I bought it, but it actually turned out to be fantastic! Shahrukh is at his humorous best in this one. I watched it back to back cause it was absolutely wonderful. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much. Easily one of the best ones with Shahrukh.

Its about a young man with a dream to be his own boss. But reality is, he works for a boss who manipulates him and in a way doesn't allow him to be his own man so to speak. But on the other hand, Shahrukh is brilliant and doesn't allow himself to be a victim. His constantly talking his boss into giving him huge amounts of money for the work that he does and he isn't shy about stating what is in his mind, he just covers it up very quickly with wit and charm. Seriously, buy it. Its very uplifting and just hugely entertaining.",1292457600,11,846,4.158536585365853
1784220,3,B00006L9WB,"This was made in 1997 with an SRK still with his puppy fat. A lot of the feel of the movie is more the Hollywood romances of the 1960s than a movie of the 90s.
However SRK is always good (and better in the second half than the first) and there is good chemistry between him and the girl (Juhi Chawla).
I was tossing up about holding onto this as it feels a bit corny and dated but it does have a certain something given all those qualifications.",1228953600,,445,4.068181818181818

But a very large percentage of Bollywood cinema requires from the audience - especially the Western audience - a grain of salt (maybe two grains of salt), a certain mindset, and lowered expectations.

Fox and Gabrielle Anwar. YES BOSS, released in 1997, stars Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, although he gets second billing to Aditya Pancholi, who plays the bad guy.

Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) dreams of having his own advertising agency, a dream he believes can be realized thru the influence and financing of his boss Sidharth (Aditya Pancholi). Accordingly, he toadies up to the man, playing Sidharth's willing right hand man. But what happens when his philandering boss sets his sight on a girl Rahul himself fancies? Seema (Juhi Chawla) is a nice, beautiful middle-class girl who toils as a model and keeps very material goals in mind. She confesses to Rahul that if she herself can't achieve her goals, then she'll marry someone who can get them for her. In finessing things so that Sidharth gets close to Seema, Rahul has to face up to his own feelings, and eventually has to make a choice. The girl? Or the office?

Two and a half stars for this picture. YES BOSS is 2 hours and 37 minutes of corny film-making, but, if you're a Shah Rukh Khan fanatic, then it makes for decent watching. I didn't mind it. But if you don't know who Shah Rukh Khan is or if you haven't seen a Bollywood flick before, then you might want to wait on this one. The positives are that actress Juhi Chawla is lovely and does invite interest and sympathy and Shah Rukh Khan ultimately salvages his smarmy role. No, he's not as charismatic as Jack Lemmon or Michael J. Fox, but there's an invested anticipation as we await Rahul finally standing up against the domineering Sidharth. But, before he does, Rahul engages in so much unabashed fawning that I wanted to slap him. Meanwhile, Aditya Pancholi plays his reprehensible role with ease. His character just coldly keeps on dangling that ad agency carrot at Rahul. Pancholi is good to hiss at.

Sometimes I'm in the mood for classy Ivory Merchant stuff and sometimes I hanker for cheese. Overall, I found YES BOSS to be a slice of cheesy heaven. ""Cheesy heaven,"" I call it, somewhat in appreciation, but I'm a Bollywood veteran by now and I know what I'm walking into. Inept acting (Johnny Lever continues to get on my last nerve), one-note characters, a plot drowning in soap opera suds, and tedious musical numbers. Yup, they're all here. But, as I've said, I'm used to the cheese, was ready for it and even had fun with it. But I don't really blame others for rolling their eyes at the blatant hokeyness of it all. And, ultimately, I can't really recommend YES BOSS. When Rahul and Seema finally declare their love for each other (in the middle of a fistfight with the villains, no less), this scene is fraught with so much cheese that I started laying out mouse traps.",1194652800,3,4498,6.069182389937107
