8637142,1,B00HXGCDH2,If I could have pressed ZERO I would have. This might be the worst rip off ever. 25 minutes of advertisement for his tour company. NOTHING about the Monuments.  Then inside it says there is another Bonus Film which does not exist at all. Don't be fooled like I did. Total RIP OFF.,1521504000,,280,4.283018867924528
