8064921,5,B0009PSDP0,"This movie concerns the era immediately after the old Soviet Russian regime pulled out of Poland, and the transition to a new Polish government (1990).  The new government investigated Polish citizens who worked for the STASI (secret police) during the occupation.  These people cooperated freely because they had not broken laws of the new regime, and couldn't be prosecuted.  However, they were now Persona Non Grata and fired from their well paid police or informer jobs.  The movie concerns those who turned to profitable crimes (narcotic smuggling), to settling ""old scores"", and to burning STASI interrogation files. The focus is on one such person (Boguslaw Linda) in an anti-hero role.  The story will have been understood by Polish audiences, but motivations and moral principles will be obscure to Americans.  (Linda had a better role in ""Pan Tadeusz"", which I recommend.)  I bought this to practice my Polish (has English subtitles).",1360368000,,944,5.253333333333333
