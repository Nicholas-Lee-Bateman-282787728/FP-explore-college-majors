Don't confuse The DEAD END KIDS / EAST KIDS / THE BOWERY BOYS. They are --- mostly ---
the same four or five guys who age and/or get replaced from the '30s through
1956's last film with Bernard AND Leo Gorcey; 1957's film where David changes his last name, back, to Gorcey.
From 1957-1958 The ""Boys"" are: Huntz Hall; Stanley Clements; David Gorcey & Eddie LeRoy...
