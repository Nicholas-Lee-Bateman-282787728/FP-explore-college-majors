508229,5,6302757096,"Jack Nicholson is a wonderful actor, but since the early 1970s, virtually all of his performances have been variations of Jack playing Jack.  This is not to say that he has not been terrific doing this, but there is a  distinct impression that there hasn't been much of a stretch in his acting  since Chinatown.  Not so with Five Easy Pieces - Nicholson completely loses  himself in the character of Bobby Dupee, and gives what is arguably his  best performance ever. What's more, the film, which opened in 1970, depicts  better than any other film the alienation of the generation of the late  1960s-early 1970s. Nicholson's Bobby Dupee is a talented classical musician  who comes from a family of talented classical musicians.  He has, however,  chosen to deny his past by living (one might almost say ""hiding"")  with his girl friend, Rayette (a terrific Karen Black) among blue collar  workers. The bulk of the film centers on Bobby's return home to visit his  father, who has suffered a stroke, and the interaction of Bobby (and  Rayette) with various members of the household.  Nicholson's acting talent  was never more apparent than in the scene where he is out walking with his  wheel-chair bound father and tries to explain why he has chosen the path he  has taken.  The scene has an improvisational quality, and Nicholson is both  natural and moving.  It is a moment that can stand with anything he has  done since.",926294400,58,1424,4.793388429752066

508265,5,6302757096,"Quite simply Jack Nicholson's best film. Good writing, realistic settings and dialogue, and a great road trip section are the ingredients to the all Americana picture, Nicholson plays Bobby Dupea, a man in search of something better; like a westerner something over the next horizon or in another place. He knows he's not a gentleman. He's not a good partner for women, his own family or himself. He's lost. He's incipient alcoholic. It's also an exploration of American classes in conflict, and how that plays out in Nicholson's character. He can't stand the bourgeois middle class values of his family, and wants to disappear into the underclass, but there is no salvation there either. He feels nothing. His treatment of his girlfriend is harsh in the extreme. All this is redeemed by a realistic treatment of the subject and the talent of a young Nicholson, and support by Karen Black and others. The way he clears things up in the restaurant scene is worth the price of admission.",1479686400,5,985,4.869047619047619

I thought plot was boring, it moved slowly, and while a young Jack N did a reasonably good job with the script he had, the rest of the acting was pretty mediocre.",1476403200,,380,4.053333333333334
508267,5,6302757096,"THE quintessential early Nicholson.  He is the raw Everyman, as comfortable in the oil fields with Billy Green Bush or the arms of Karen Black singing Tammy Wynette as he is picking apart the facade of his artistic, intellectually distant family or whipping out a few chords of Chopin on the Steinway.

But that's the problem--there is something eating at him.  At his roots, he is at odds with himself and the world, trying to make peace with his failed artistic potential, trying to find his place, some meaning--something many of us were trying to do in 1970 when this movie came out against the backdrop of Vietnam, the free love and idealism of the hippies, the assassinations of both Kennedys and Dr. King, tricky Dick Nixon...you name it.  It was the unraveling of a way of life, of Father Knows Best and Leave It To Beaver.  Nobody knew the way anymore.  We were all adrift.

And so Five Easy Pieces captured perfectly the angst of the times we were in.  That particular dissatisfaction with life, the world, and ourselves is what this movie is all about.  Of course it lost out in the Academy Awards to Patton (George C. Scott taking best actor from Nicholson), but there were never more iconic movie scenes than in Five Easy Pieces (we were all counting the times Nicholson got laid to see if that's what the title meant).  Perhaps the one to top them all is the ""chicken salad sandwich"" scene where Jack clears the table at the diner.  I was an extra on a Nicholson film and got to spend some very brief time around him in the early 90s, and he was making jokes about that scene even then.  And for you fans of Sally Struthers, there's a must-see one for you.  ....Anyway, for Nicholson fans (or anybody), this is one film for the time capsule.",1474329600,,1755,4.515822784810126

508315,4,6302757096,"""Five Easy Pieces"" (1970) is directed by Bob Rafelson (The King of Marvin Gardens). The movie is about Bobby Dupeau (Jack Nicholson) who is an unsettled man who has rejected his privileged youth as a piano prodigy and has been drifting from place to place and job to job. He has a girl friend (Karen Black) who is a waitress who dreams of singing country music. This melancholic movie shows us the heart of an America that is not idealized, where normal people are just trying to get by in a world that has little meaning for them. The was one of several award winning films produced by BBC, including Easy Rider, and The Last Picture Show.

This Criterion set includes a number of special features including the history of BBC, and interviews with the director and actors, as well as an essay by Ket Jones. This movie is also part of a Criterion collection of seven BBC movies found in ""America Lost and Found"".",1437264000,,912,4.527272727272727
508316,1,6302757096,"Some call this movie a ""character study.""  That's a euphemism for no plot.

The Jack Nicholson character is a terrible person: mean to his girlfriend, mean to a waitress, and mean to others.

For example, when he goes bowling with his girlfriend and another couple, he puts down his girlfriend for bowling badly.

There isn't a villain which makes the Jack Nicholson character someone to root for by contrast.

508345,4,6302757096,"This was not the best film that Nicholson was ever in certainly, but it was the one that starred him in all his glory.  If you've seen him before in other films, he's almost exactly the same here.  Dysfunctional, embittered, alienated and self-centered, it's all here.
In the film, Jack Nicholson is what some of us were(are):  hanging between two worlds.  For him it was the world of conformity and 'success' vs. his instincts to be his own man.  The title comes from 5 easy (piano) pieces that he memorized in his youth when he was being groomed for success.  We follow him as he re-traces his roots and we meet his (insufferable) family.  The most memorable scene was in a diner where Nicholson hassles a waitress in a famous tirade that you might remember...
Some viewers will identify with this film(as did I) and see themselves and their family foibles on the screen.  Others will not and find this entire exercise a colossal bore.  Hopefully, you have just enough information to decide for yourself...",1423353600,2,1008,4.714285714285714

508371,4,6302757096,"""Five Easy Pieces"" (1970) is a well-known drama about Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson) who leaves behind his high society upbringing in preference to being a drifter, working on oil fields and so on. When he catches word of his dad's recent illness he drives up to Washington, reluctantly with his bimbo girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black). While there he has a fling with his brother's babe (Susan Anspach).

Although the story is somewhat meandering and contains a few less-than-noble characters, this is a well-done character study of a confused soul who doesn't know what he wants. He sees the pomposity, illusion and pressure that goes with upper-class culture and seeks liberation in the more common, which doesn't wholly inspire him. He has temper tantrums, cheats on his girlfriend, and is basically a problem waiting to happen, although he's not entirely without respectable or likable qualities.

I think the film struck a chord at the time because Robert's plight in the story represented the dilemma of many people after the counter-culture revolution of the 60s. As a society, we threw off the restraints of conventional morality and education to basically have a wild party. But what do you do when the party's over and you're hung over?

The chicken salad scene is infamous and there are quite a few other memorable scenes, like the ultra-cynical hitchhiker with her female pal (Toni Basil). Some characters are intentionally over-the-top, like the overbearing wannabe intellectual at the Dupea residence, but this was done to be amusing. Despite the exaggerations, the characters ring true.

If you like Susan Anspach here be sure to check her out in 1988's ""The Legend of Wolf Lodge"" (aka ""Into the Fire"") where she plays a scary housewife who thinks she's hotter than she actually is (see my review), which isn't to say that Susan's not attractive as Catherine in this movie because she definitely is. She has a unique look and intriguing personality. Too bad she shows signs of being a trollop but, then again, it was 1970 and, besides, she felt guilty about her behavior.

Someone said ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a film you'll enjoy more as you get older and that's the case with me. The first couple of times I viewed it I found it mildly absorbing but was ultimately unimpressed. I didn't get the hype. I saw it for the third time last night and felt it was much better than I remembered. You'll appreciate it more too if you're fairly mature, don't have ADHD, and you understand that it's not a conventional drama with typical contrivances and a charming protagonist. Rather, it's a slice-of-life drama focusing on a confused and sometimes childish individual who isn't always likable. It's equal parts fascinating, insightful, amusing, meandering and pointless.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Illinois.

Bobby is one of those who doesn't really find anything to hold him down to one place or one thing or one person or one life. He is one of the 1% who never find anything they want, but end up finding everything else they don't want.

508435,1,6302757096,"Five Easy Pieces was released in theaters on September 12, 1970. Five Easy Pieces is a 1970 American drama film written by Carole Eastman (as Adrien Joyce) and Bob Rafelson, and directed by Rafelson. The film stars Jack Nicholson, with Karen Black, Susan Anspach, Ralph Waite, and Sally Struthers in supporting roles.

The film tells the story of a surly oil rig worker, Bobby Dupea, whose blue-collar existence belies his privileged youth as a child prodigy. When word reaches Bobby that his father is dying, he goes home to see him, reluctantly bringing along his pregnant girlfriend, Rayette (Black), a dimwitted waitress. The film was selected to be preserved by the Library of Congress in the National Film Registry in 2000.

Summary: Classical pianist Robert Dupea (Nicholson), who comes from a family of musicians, works in a California oil field. Most of his time is spent in bowling alleys, drinking beer in the trailer of his friend, Elton (Bush), or with his waitress girlfriend, Rayette (Black). When he learns that she is pregnant, and his friend Elton is arrested for having robbed a gas station a year earlier, he quits his job and leaves for Los Angeles where his sister, Partita (Smith), also a pianist, is making a recording. Partita informs him that their father has suffered two strokes and urges him to return to the family home on Puget Sound. He tells Rayette that he must go to see his father and reluctantly agrees to take her along. On the way, they pick up two lesbians headed for Alaska whose constant chatter about ""filth"" increasingly annoys Robert. The four of them are thrown out of a restaurant when he gets into an argument with a waitress who refuses to accommodate his special order. Eventually, Robert reaches his destination. Embarrassed by Rayette's lack of polish, he registers her in a motel and goes to his family home. At dinner that night, he meets Catherine Van Oost (Anspach), a young pianist engaged to his brother, Carl (Waite), a violinist.

Questions: Who does Robert fall in love with? What happens to Rayette at the motel? Who ridicules Rayette background? Why did Rayette background come into question? What was Robert's nurse doing to his father? Whom does Robert try to convince to go away with him? What happens to Rayette?

Fun Facts: ""Five Easy Pieces"" refers to a book of piano lessons for beginners. The song played by Dupea on the piano in the back of the truck driving down the road is Chopin's ""Fantaisie"" in F. When Dupea goes to quit his oil-rigging job, the loud whirring of machines can be heard in the background. George Lucas used this identical sound effect seven years later, for the trash compacter scene in Star Wars.

My Thoughts: This movie was stupid right from the beginning. There's really no plot that keeps your interest. There was no action and the movie didn't make any sense to me what so ever. Karen Black who played Rayette was waste in this movie. She played the role of a wife that was constantly insulted and put down. Just because I can't give this zero stars I have to give it 1 weasel star and that's being nice.",1389571200,6,3103,4.749536178107607

I wouldn't want to spend a single minute of my life with any of these people.  The only one I developed any feeling for was Karen Black's character, primarily because she was so blameless and pathetic.

Also, this may have been the first film I have ever seen that was devoid of story.  There was no plot.  No beginning, middle or end.  No arc.  No resolution.  There was no reason to watch these painfully obnoxious, irritating, cancerous characters do or say anything.

Then it just ended abruptly with no rhyme or reason. It was pointless! What a waste of my time. How it ever got 4 nominations I don't know. It must have simply been because Jack Nicholson was in it and he was at his prime then. Maybe it's the type a film that only men can understand.

508478,5,6302757096,"""Five Easy Pieces"" is something like (and nothing like) ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Fair-Lady/dp/B002HK9IDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Fair Lady</a>."" Like ""My Fair Lady"" it questions the way we divide society and how we imagine those who aren't in our supposed class. It never tells you any of this, and that's where it is brilliant. It does so in a deliberated, gritty, dramatic way, sans the effervescence of Audrey Hepburn.

Back in eighth grade, we learn every story has an antagonist and a protagonist. Here, which is which becomes clear at the end, but I went through the first fourth fifths certain I knew. Again, the movie presents this brilliantly.

""Five Easy Pieces"" reminded me too, of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-of-a-Salesman/dp/B00007ELDP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death of a Salesman</a>,"" as Willy Loman was looking for his place in a society which had no place for him. That's what Jack Nicholson's character, Robert Eroica Dupea (Bobby), needs. He sees the hypocrisy and shallowness of his arrogant, insular family, but he knows he is intellectually and culturally in a different place than his blue collar adopted world.

And, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-Godot/dp/080214442X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for Godot</a>,"" Bobby wants what he needs to simply arrive. He doesn't know where to look. He looks for it in his dumb friend Elton and in a cheap sexual escapade with Betty (Sally Struthers). They are both disposable relationships Bobby wishes were more substantial.

While the movie shows its age, released in 1970, it is not dated. There is a realism to it, to the point of almost smelling the spilled gas and old coffee at the truck stop scene at the end.

When I finished watching it today, having neither seen it nor known the plot previously, I sat quietly, in awe. It hit me in the way reading a great piece of literature hits me. It is among the best movies I have ever seen.

Go watch it, then look up Roger Ebert's review. His analysis is spot-on.

I fully recommend ""Five Easy Pieces.""

The performance is one that is without any of the mannerisms that define so many of his post-Cuckoo's Nest roles. Despite the fact that it was made in 1970, one could argue that the film defines the entire 1970s decade. It is a quiet, understated film about a man (Bobby Dupea) who doesn't know what he is looking for, but keeps looking. He comes from a well-to-do family, all, including himself, quite talented musically, but he has abandoned that to work in the oil fields and live as an unskilled worker. When his father has a stroke that leaves him immobile and speechless, Bobby returns home, and the rest of the film is the clash between his current life and the life he left behind. Nicholson's scene alone with the father who can no longer speak is acting at its very finest (it ranks with Brando's scene with his dead wife in Last Tango In Paris). There is no easy resolution - all he can do is leave this life behind and keep searching. The supporting players (Karen Black, Susan Anspach, Lois Smith) are perfectly cast.

What most reviewers seem to have missed is all the other hilariously funny bits: the ping-pong game with brother Carl - every scene with Carl in it is hilarious; the mannered, typically goofy performance of Lois Smith; the fact that the brothers' middle names are Eroica and Fidelio; the hopelessly out-of-tune  piano in the obsessively musical family's home; and, of course, the bizarre affair between Partita - there's another name for you classical music buffs -  and the patriarch's nurse, a Mr Spicer  -  I guess he was added to liven things up. Almost as good as the humor are the wonderful performances of Ralph Waite as Carl, and Karen Black and Susan Anspach.

508672,5,6302757096,"I love character studies like this one, and there are few that really hit the nail on the head as accurately as `Five Easy Pieces'.  When you have the right balance of script, actor and director the story just kind of `tells itself' effortlessly, and that is the case with the impressive exercise in human poignancy.

The film centers around Robert Dupea.  Robert, failed pianist, is holing himself away in Texas oilfields with his needy girlfriend Rayette and his best friend Elton.  Robert isn't content in the least, but he needs his surroundings to complete him, keeping him from a past he doesn't want to entertain.  His world comes rushing in on him when Rayette becomes pregnant around the same time his father's mortality is called into question.  Still struggling with his relationship with Rayette, Robert takes her along with him as he attempts to mend his relationship with his father before he dies.

The character of Robert Eroica Dupea is one that I will never forget.  There are very few characters that live on in my mind as extraordinary cinematic creations.  Robert Dupea is one of them (alongside the likes of James Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd and Liza Minnelli's Pookie Adams).  What Jack Nicholson (screen GOD) does with this character is remarkable.  Now, one of my Ammy friends (yes, you Beany) has tried to label Nicholson as a one trick pony.  All I have to say is ""WATCH THIS MOVIE!""  Seriously, seeing the subtle unnerving unraveling that overtakes Robert is just...wow.  The character is so complex and so full of range that it really takes a delicate balance of earnest restraint to make it work, and Nicholson understands that balance beautifully.

And how can I forget to single out the heartbreaking Karen Black who understands how to layer Rayette with enough endearing qualities to offset her undeniable annoyance.

With marvelously crafted sequences of scenery that elongates the emotional core of the film, `Five Easy Pieces' understands the importance of coupling all facets of the film with each other in perfect synchronized order.  Ever facet of the film is a compliment to the other.

The underside of man and what makes him tick (and hide) is something that has always fascinated me.  `Five Easy Pieces' is a spectacular film that makes me understand something deeper about myself with every viewing.

And that final frame...just breaks my heart for so many different reasons its overwhelming (but in a welcomed way).",1298937600,5,2457,4.960880195599022
508673,4,6302757096,"This film is everything that modern character studies long to be. 'Five Easy Pieces' is revealing about a wayward culture; it strikes the audience with its emotional interactions; and lets us peer into the hearts and minds of very intriguing personalities.

The story follows Robert Dupea (Nicholson), who has abandoned his well-to-do, intellectual family for a proletarian lifestyle of manual labor and promiscuity. His impetus is clear from the beginning--our culture is restrictive and absurd, and must be rejected. But refuting his old life doesn't exempt him from the world's ludicrousness and we find him restless and discontented from the opening. Arguments with his girlfriend and the famous 'chicken salad sandwich' scene epitomize this agitation.

Dupea returns to his family under the pretext of attending to his ill father. There, he finds what he believes could be his salvation in the form of sophisticated woman who is also romantic and optimistic (she doesn't believe she's ever been bored). In her, Dupea sees reason and justification for his old life and considers it once again. A clash of interest results, generating the sharpest interactions and the bitterest of conflicts.

This clash is all that modern character studies aim for. Failing to show the value of the rejected old life, however, there is no good reason for the clash and the character is seen to be shallow and heartless, leaving the audience with nothing to study.

Enjoy this picture for the craftsmanship with which Rafelson molds the internal conflict, an art that is evidently admired these days and very rarely achieved.",1282953600,3,1612,5.212355212355212
508674,4,6302757096,"[Spoiler Alert] This film forces existential analysis because Bobby's character is so obviously and painfully conflicted. His actions reveal intelligence, along with the requisite anti-heroic characteristics of privilege, superiority and arrogance. Despite his philandering ways, he also reveals a moral awareness and complexity, demonstrated by his decision to see his father and taking Rayette along for the trip. These aspects create an expectation for psychological understanding, compelling the viewer to attach motivation or meaning to his actions.

Bobby's romantic relationships are a manifestation of his internal conflict. He knows Rayette is uneducated and her intelligence level is questionable. He treats her abominably, if not abusively, but fundamentally respects her qualities (at least when juxtaposed with the values of his upbringing). His regard is notably revealed in his defense of her character and humanity in the parlor scene. His connection with his brother's girlfriend is unsurprising because of his womanizing tendencies: The element of interest is that Bobby seemingly desires to pursue a deeper relationship with Catherine. She is Rayette's opposite, Bobby's mirror, and a necessary manifestation of his internal conflict: She is never an honest romantic interest. Is his a universal or individual conflict? Is it attributable to privileged socio-economic position or a pervasive post-modern condition?

What aches in this film is Bobby's awareness of the conflict, but the inability to dismiss or resolve it. Various familiar literary characters abound with possible resolutions: Camus' Mersault (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stranger-Everyman-s-Library/dp/0679420266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stranger (Everyman's Library)</a>)attaches no meaning to action; Shakespeare's Prince Hal (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Oxford-Shakespeare-Henry-IV-Part-I/dp/0199536139/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Oxford Shakespeare: Henry IV, Part I</a>)'slums it,' in preparation for his greater station; Self-destructive, Bukowskian characters (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-of-Ordinary-Madness/dp/0872861554/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales of Ordinary Madness</a>)create their own brand of misery and adversity, meanwhile forging a personal mythos and truth. Yet, when things inevitably 'go bad' for Bobby, he simply escapes, anything to negate or avoid performing those five easy pieces.

The original, scripted ending involved a car crash, proving fatal for Bobby, but not Rayette. This ending forces a predictable and poetic resolution, which was replaced by the camera's distant observation of the gas station. Instead, Bobby's departure implies the repetition of his Sisyphean cycle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141182008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Myth of Sisyphus (Penguin Modern Classics)</a>), thereby inflicting a haunting ambiguity, emotional hollowness and pervasive meaninglessness to the film's conclusion. A bleak and nightmarish American vision!",1280707200,5,3214,7.321243523316062
508713,4,6302757096,"Bob Rafelson's film stands out as one of the landmark films of the post-studio period (also known as ""the Hollywood Renaissance""), as important for its cinematic textures and long takes and intelligent (if flawed) script as for its iconic performance by Jack Nicholson as its complex anti-hero, Bobby Dupea. The film starts in the oil country in Southern California, where Bobby works as a driller living with his dim girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black). We see Bobby's bad relations with Rayette (he cheats on her and lies to her) and with his friend Elton (whom he thinks he's superior to) without a full sense of what makes him tick; then Bobby is summoned back to his family's estate in the San Juan islands, and we discover that he's from a cultured, well-off family and turned his back on a career as a concert pianist. The film involves our understanding of how torn Bobby is between his two worlds. While he responds to the vitality and freedom of his working-class life, he still feels better than the hapless, needy Rayette; when during the stay at home he meets an intelligent attractive woman (Susan Anspach) seeing his brother, he immediately responds to her. But he can't be with her anymore easily than he can be with Rayette, who has become pregnant. Bobby's only chances lie with the one thing he can do well--which is to leave without ties or traces.

The best thing about the script is how much intelligence it cedes to its audience; we are rarely presented with much obvious in Bobby's dealings with his siblings, the wounded Partita (Lois Smith, in a classic performance) and the impotent Carl (Ralph Waite), but a few key scenes--one in a recording studio, another at a Ping Pong table in front of the Dupea home--tell us everything without spelling anything out too obviously. Nicholson's ability to both hold the screen and portray boiling rage very humorously (as in the famous chicken salad sandwich scene) made this one of the roles that most cemented him as an icon of the Seventies; his performances during this period did not depend as much on schtick as they later did, and he really seems to give the part the ambivalence and complexity it deserves. Rayette is perhaps too much of a cartoon as written, but Karen Black gives her a lusciousness that make it clear why Bobby returns to her. In a very wise move, Rafelson allows us to hear twice at some length her beautiful voice singing the songs of her idol Tammy Wynette,  allowing us to see how country music affects her and expands her emotions as much as classical music does the culture-vulture Dupeas. And Rafelson's beautiful long shots allow us to understand the textures of this world: the ramshackle glamor of the Dupeas' rundown giant house, the luxurious halo of Anspach's hair (one of the few indulgences this disciplined woman allows herself), and the moving series of individual framed portraits of the Dupeas the camera pans slowly over, telling us more than we had expected about the family's dynamics, when Bobby finally plays a Chopin piece at some length for Anspach's Catherine. There are multiple standout cameos from actors who would become very famous later in the decade, including Sally Struthers and Fannie Flagg, and some who did not, such as Irene Dailey and Helena Kallianiotes (who gets many of the film's funniest lines as a trippy depressed hitchhiker).",1278720000,4,3365,4.850434782608696

Bobby can boil over and explode at any minute (and does a few times). He has many issues, he: does not treat his girlfriend well; likes to have some drinks and the fun associated with that; and does not have a good relationship with his father.

Most of the characters in this film are eccentric and I found some of their interactions forced. Meeting Palm and Terry on the road did not add much except too much talk of filth and the infamous ""chicken salad"" scene in the restaurant.

""He's the moodiest guy I've ever gone out with,"" says his unappreciated, attractive yet ditzy girlfriend.  It's a movie of the times, 1970, and reads like a 'dark side' theme narrative of the end of the 60s, dawn of the 70s.  It's not a superfast movie, though does slowly generate interest.  The filmography is beautiful, richly colorful, with the occasional understated symbolic shots (windshield wiper wiping away rain) and incredible views which range from oil fields in South Cal to beautiful northern pine country in Canada.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  There's not much of a soundtrack outside of a few country numbers.  Silence speaks louder than words.  Camut couldn't have done it better.  You're in the presence of art with this movie, albeit art that leaves a bitter taste and which you could write off as BS in the final analysis, which I partly do, but you gotta hand it to the film-maker and the times for letting something as oddball and irreverent as this to get out.  Since I've been watching ""All in the Family"" lately, I noticed a younger 'Gloria' (Sally Struthers, aka 'Little Goil') also has a small part in here (hot stuff).  Come to think of it, there are a lot of hot chicks in this movie. No wonder Robert Dupea (Nicholson) doesn't want to settle down.  His general aimlessness though could perhaps be larger than his inability to settle for one girl. It's arguable.

For fans of the nihilistic, I also recommend ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"" (1974) which weilds a similar kind of existentialism but with a lot more octane.",1266105600,3,1634,4.792857142857143

508718,5,6302757096,"You can go back to Five Easy Pieces through stages of life and gleen something new. I first saw it as a long haired teen with Cerebral Palsy, in the late 80s. Bobby became my idol. Every kid who has ever been picked on has people he or she wants to stick it to--like Bobby did that waitress. Uncomfortable with how I  walk? Hold your discomfort between your knees, sorrority sister.

The 1970 film was made in that post- Manson, Altamont, Kent State  aimlessnes; this counter-culture thing is not going to work. Now what? BUT the theme is timeless: we are wondering in the woods, and man, we are PISSED!

Bobby also wonders: from state to state, women to women, identity to identity, life to life. His problem is, he is smart. He is aware of his own aimlessness. He has nothing, but does not know what he wants. He has opportunities, but never takes them. He demands honesty from everyone, because that is all he can offer anyone.

As a teenager, I fell in love with Nicholson's pyrotechnics. Bobby does what he wants,  says what he wants, takes what he wants, and has sex with who he wants, all while pointing out the hypocrocy of everyone around him.

He is very funny in his rage, and does and says all the things we want to, but fearfully stop ourselves. If you have never felt this way, you have never felt condecended to, excluded or mocked .

As a 40 year old, Bobby becomes more complex to me. He is wounded, and can't commit to anything or anybody. Underneath the anger is a man fundimentally confounded about who he wants to be, and who he wants to be it with. He can confront anyone, but does like a petulant teenager; the teenager I was, a long, long time ago. But he can't confront himself. He is a boy in a man's body, and a very sad boy at that

Which raises a question: Is Nicholson overplaying this? It is easy to fall in love with Bobby's bull in a china shop style, especially when, most of the time, he is right on the merits. His confrontational attitude must have been liberating to watch, given the socio-political  context of 1970.

Butt is easy to forget that in the end, Bobby's anger--which really keeps him from the people and things he is so primally afraid of--will doom him to a meaningless, empty life. The question is, does the magic Nicholson is working here obscure the true flaws of a very wounded character?

I am not sure, but the more i watch this movie, the older i get, the more I pity Bobby. Whether this is a function of my own age and experiance or seeing past the suculant vaneer of Nicholson's acting, I don't know.

But I do know Five Easy Pieces is one of the few period films I watch over and over for it's complexity. You're not going to find this depth in Easy Rider or Bob Carol Ted and Alice. Even with all the 1970 implications of this film, we know people like Bobby, whether we run away from them or try to help them. You could make this film today without changing a thing.

Nicholson's performance in this film greatly exceeds his performance in Easy Rider as did the films themselves. Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider has a heavy theme of drugs but Bob Rafelson explores something much more deep than Easy Rider did. Five Easy Pieces explored a man who wants the life could have easily had. Nicholson's character gives up his life as a concert pianist to work on oil fields. His wife, Karen Black, is emotionally instable and listens to country music whenever sad. In Easy Rider, Karen Black is a prostitute. See the point I'm trying to make? In Five Easy Pieces, the characters have much more depth, whereas, in Easy Rider they're just hippies. Five Easy Pieces was not intended to be great but for me, Easy Rider tried way to hard to be iconic, have famous quotes etc. But Five Easy Pieces was not made like that at all. Some of the best bits of Easy Rider were with Jack Nicholson. Once I actually came to like the character he died, never to be talked about ever  again in the film. I would recommend Five Easy Pieces over Easy Rider any day of the week and I'm sorry if you disagree.",1242950400,2,1284,4.5344827586206895

As a man who has been there and survived, I enjoyed the movie on several levels and would watch it again, however, my daughter, a drama major in her senior year at college, said ""I don't get it.""

Released in 1970, ""Five Easy Pieces"" heralded a renaissance of highly personal character driven films championed by not only since film's director, Bob Rafelson, but also Robert Altman and Hal Ashby, among others.  This film focuses on people, their quirks and their interpersonal relationships.  The film's central character, Robert Eroica Dupea, is not a particularly likable person but as written superbly by Carol Eastman and brilliantly assayed by Jack Nicholson he becomes sympathetic.  Stifled by an austere artistic clan, Dupea escapes but leads a directionless existence going from one meaningless job after another and engages in a romance with a waitress(Karen Black) that he has little if anything in common with.  Nicholson gives a carefully modulated performance, a departure from his more flamboyant work in ""Easy Rider"", suggesting both the anger, apathy, and sadness that seethes inside.  The real revelation here is Black.  A lesser actress would have portrayed Rayette as a dumb bunny.  Black saw more complexity in her character.  Rayette is certainly unlearned but Black brought out the sweetness and the sadness in her.  It's unfathomable how Black lost the Oscar to Helen Hayes in ""Airport""(?!).

""Five Easy Pieces"" (1970) directed by Bob Rafelson - is one of the real gems that needs to be seen and admired but is sadly not known enough to the viewers. The film is build as a road movie around Bobby Dupea, a middle-class intellectual turned truck driver and working in the oil fields. Playing a once promising pianist (his full name is Robert ""Eroica"" Dupea - he was named after Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, Op. 55, The Eroica Symphony - no more, no less) who chose to abandon his musical family (""Five Easy Pieces"" refers to five pieces by Chopin), Jack Nicholson has rarely been better. It is one of his performances that I truly love and admire. If you only saw Nicholson in his later films where he often plays the same character over again, the combination of Daryl Van Horne and Col. Nathan R. Jessep, find ""Five Easy Pieces"". Bobby's fully shaded character with its outbursts of emotions, insecurities, and poignancy of wasted intelligence is wonder to follow. Karen Black as Bobby's girlfriend Rayette, Tammy Wynett's admiring waitress, is outstanding. Laszlo Kovack's cinematography is gorgeous. The chicken - salad scene in a diner is a classic and pure delight to watch.

508751,5,6302757096,"I knew nothing about FIVE EASY PIECES beyond the famous diner tantrum scene that is often shown on movie specials. Yet from the soundtrack of the opening scene featuring Tammy Wynette singing STAND BY YOUR MAN I was  involved in this absorbing character study.  We first meet Jack Nicholson's Bobby in Bakersfield, California where he is working in the oil fields and living with his beautiful but silly diner waitress girlfriend Rayette.  At first Bobby seems like a typical blue collar laborer hanging out at the bowling alley and being none to nice to his loyal and possibly pregnant girlfriend.  Soon we find out he comes from a much more privileged and cultured background as he and Rayette travel to an island in Washington state where Bobby was raised.  There we meet Bobby's mute stroke victim father whom we guess was once a musical tyrant, his eccentric but sweet pianist sister, his physically awkward violinist brother, his father's nurse and his brother's musician girlfriend.  This film is all about relationships and character development and is well acted as is vital in such films.  Look for several 1970's television stars in supporting parts including Sally Struthers playing a bowling alley bimbo, Fannie Flagg a trailer park housewife and Ralph Waite as Bobby's literally stiff necked brother.  The ending of the film is surprising yet fits with Bobby's pattern of choosing the ""easy piece"".",1185494400,2,1412,5.056034482758621
508772,4,6302757096,"Jack Nicholson plays Bobby, a man who will only have life his way.  Much like Camus' 'The Stranger' or Hemingway's return home soldier in ""A Soldier's Story,"" Bobby lives for the moment.  He goes through women at whim and convenience, and he doesn't like to waste any precious time.

At the beginning he hooks up with a friend to work in the oil fields.  In one of the early days on the job, they get stuck in traffic.  His friend sees that they'll be late for work, whereas Bobby can only see wasted time.  So he does what no one else would do: He leaves the driver's seat and climbs a truck moving a piano.  Once he uncovers it, he starts to play.  As soon as he finds the song he wants, traffic starts moving again, taking him to a new destination.  Se la vie.

The movie challenges convention.  In a famous restaurant scene, Bobby, who has decided to pick up two women in distress along the way, has an interesting way of getting what he wants when he asks for whole wheat toast to go with his omelette.  But real affairs have to do with his sister who is a recording pianist artist.  When visiting her at the studio, he finds out that their father has had several strokes and is in poor health.  Because he wants to, he goes to visit, and the results show us someone who refuses to put up with convention when it doesn't suit him.
Yet, a scene with his ailing father suggest that he is also living a lie, one that exposes a vulnerability underneath his callousness.

'Five Easy Pieces' is a classic.  It feels authentic because Nicholson and supporting players give us a clear and solid, yet episodic vision of a man who lives for the moment and accepts as ludicrous anything different than his way.",1183507200,,1704,4.3789808917197455

As an existentially pained outcast of upper-middle-class breeding, Jack's pent-up Bobby is especially absorbing to watch, as he denigrates Rayette's crass singing efforts or spars with a waitress over the vagaries of a chicken-salad sandwich.

508774,4,6302757096,"This movie could have been a masterpiece, but it doesn't have a message other than total despair about the human condition. Jack Nicholson plays Bobby Dupea, who is an oil field roustabout when first we lay eyes on him--but he is not exactly who he seems.

He fits right in with his Buddy Elton (Billie ""Green"" Bush), Elton's wife Stoney (Fannie Flagg), and his girlfriend, Rayette Dipesto (Karen Black). Though Rayette is far from an accomplished bowler, which irks Bobby, she loves him, puts up with him, and wants to be a country singer. She listens to ""Stand by Your Man"" by Tammy Wynette constantly, which also irks Bobby. She not only wants to emulate Tammy Wynette's singing, but she embodies the sentiments expressed in the song. As we get to know Robert Eroica Dupea better, we see that director Bob Rafelson intended the song as ironic commentary.

The trailer parks, truck stops, oil fields, and bowling alleys of the first part of the movie are pure Bakersfield. Some reviewers thought that it was meant to be Texas, but it was pure Bakersfield. The first inkling we have that Bobby is not just an oil field roustabout takes place on I-5 just before the Highway 43 turn off to Shafter and Wasco. Drinking on the way to work with Elton they get in a traffic jam. Bobby climbs aboard a flatbed hauling furniture and a piano. He plays the piano, but where we would expect him to be at best a honky tonk piano player, even amid the cacophony of car horns, you can tell that he is classically trained. He continues playing, even as the truck veers off to an exit.

Continuing South from Bakersfield, next we learn more about Bobby as he arrives in Los Angeles and walks into a recording studio. The session is for a classical piano concerto, and the recording engineers are less than sympathetic to the woman playing. She is eccentric, and has the quirk of singing, out of tune, like a child, while playing. This is Bobby's sister, and she wants him to come back to the family mansion to visit their sick father. He is the patriarch of a musical family, and Bobby is very much the prodigal son.

Bobby reluctantly agrees to return, to attempt to reconcile with his ailing father, and even more reluctantly agrees to let Rayette come.

Along the way they pick up two women stranded on the road. One of the women is an insufferable nihilist, who complains constantly about the filth and garbage produced by men and civilization. She is also intended as ironic commentary, but in a strange post-modern way. It is as if modern art, from T.S. Elliott's Wasteland, to this very movie, is nothing but incessant grousing. It offers no solution, but merely points out flaws and shortcomings incessantly. She wants to go to Alaska, because she thinks it is clean. She has seen the pictures of the snow. Bobby is amused by her naivet and says that is before the big thaw. The woman's companion is named Terry Grouse (Toni Basil), by the way. The whole encounter would seem to be pretty pointless, except it leads to another classic scene, where they stop at a truck stop and the waitress refuses to make any substitutions. ""You want me to hold the chicken?""

In Washington Bobby confronts his father, who has had several strokes, and is completely mute. This is a difficult scene for Nicholson, but he rises to the challenge. You see several layers deep, the raw and hurt emotions, and a small boy trying to please his father, but never feeling like he can measure up.

There is another crucial scene where Bobby is trying to seduce a music student (Susan Anspach) who is living at the family compound. She asks him to play something for her, and he plays her a beautiful piece by Chopin. She responds, but he laughs and says he picked it because it was the easiest piece he knew, and he played it when he was eight years old, and he played it better then. He felt nothing, he confesses. This leads to her telling him that he is unable to love himself, his work, music, or anything. Unable to love himself, he doesn't deserve the love of another. This is the closest the film comes to stating its message, but as you can see, it offers no hope, no solution. Sure, Bobby could just find something to believe in, or love himself a little more, or be like the woman pointing all this out to him, but that is just not available to him. He can't make a leap of faith, having no faith, or love, in or for anything.

Like I said, this movie came very close to being a masterpiece, but like the scene with Bobby and his father, it has nothing to say. It leaves you stranded, just as Bobby will inevitably leave Rayette stranded, in a gas station, as he hitches a ride to Alaska without even taking along a jacket.",1182556800,4,4701,4.522352941176471
508775,5,6302757096,"Or, as Bobby would probably say, ""Bulls*t everywhere!""  Or something more explicit.  Even with The Joker, the psychopathic writer in Kubrick's ""Shining"", and his chilling performance in ""The Departed"", I would say this is Nicholson's scariest character.

Bobby Dupea, a former piano prodigy who finds the pretentiousness of art, culture, and his entire family so revolting that he takes Timothy Leary's edict closer to heart than any hippy--he becomes a worker on an oil rig, a complete alcoholic, a brutal misogynist and generally reprehensible human being all around, completely divorced from his origins and disdainful of his considerable talents.  Karen Black, his gorgeous hilbilly girlfriend, really forms the paradox of Dupea's character: his ferocious embrace of man's lower instincts in favor of a greater authenticity and his actual repugnance when facing them for any extended period of time.  The most telling scenes in this dark but compelling tale of ultimate failure consist of Rayette and Bobby together: Bobby listening to her sweet, well intentioned but limited sentiments about life and the small world she was born into, his constant annoyance but sympathy; his violent defense of her in the presence of his ""high brow"" family, and his ultimate inability to stay with her--even when he knows she's pregnant.

Bobby's more or less constant agitation is a result of his unwillingness to face his hopelessly divided nature. Stopping traffic in a drunken rage, he hops on a moving truck and begins furiously playing a piano to the incomprehension of his drunken backwoods co-worker, flipping out on a waitress for misunderstanding his order, and trying to reconcile with a father who is catatonic from a stroke: these are all the actions of a man without the strength to face his inner demons or acknowledge them.  He protests too much without really wanting anything to change.

Bob Rafelson was obviously conscious of the contradictions inherent in the 1960's counterculture and this a commentary of sorts: the rejection of the father--the dominant culture--for good reasons, and the impotence of the son--the 60's mentality embodied by Bobby--all culminating in disaster (the present day).  This is a masterpiece and wins out over similar modern fare like ""American Beauty"" or ""Good Will Hunting"" anyday.

It was not long after Easy Rider and we had the idea that this Jack Nicholson had something to say to our 60's-70's counter-culture.  He did have something to say with some of the sharpest acting I had ever seen. He out-classed the James Dean's and Marlon Brando's, but not with ease.  Jack was workin' hard, switching from depressed concert pianist to hillbilly good time dude to misunderstood Romeo in five-minute intervals.  No, make that changeable temperament every five seconds, truly an artistic milestone. Throw in an equally magnificent portrayal by Karen Black, sexy and hillbilly; Jessica Simpson, eat your heart out, and you have the couple of the year, 1970.

Jack's father is one of those evil patriarch's that hurt their kids bad, pushing them to greatness without an ounce of love.  Consequently, the siblings are brilliant and eccentric.  The daughter is a frumpy dope.  The older son is a violinist with a neck injury, and then there's handsome Jack, shiftless, moving from bed to bed, crossing the country, a boozing bum.  Back in the Vietnam years there was an examination of bourgeois life.  Did we have to get a job and get married?  Was everyone in a particular cubbyhole, mail in the funeral?  Hence, we had the counter-culture, drugs, long haired hippies, sexual openness, and shiftless lifestyles. Bob Rafelson's film gives you that, but mercifully, with subtly.  That last scene at the gas station says it all.  I think directors would be hard pressed to sum up a film's theme so effectively with so little noise - amazing.",1165795200,12,1607,4.860294117647059

Still a big man, with a white Hemingway beard that gives him the look of an aged Sterling Hayden, old man Dupea still rules the roost in the sprawling yellow mansion his children still call home.  Tita has all but abandoned her once promising recording career, to take care of her ailing father.  She dresses like a frump, or sometimes like a little girl, with a red cardigan and pigtails.  Smith is haunting when we first glimpse her laying down some piano pieces for an unappreciative and totally bored recording engineer.  We see her as an artist first, but as an artist who seems to be losing it, for as she plays her piece, she starts humming along, apparently oblivious to the fact that the mike is going to be picking up these discordant, and increasingly loud, hums, she sounds like Winnie the Pooh.  She is ruthlessly patronized by the engineering staff, so you feel anger on her behalf at the same time as you are hoping that she will do something for herself, for who would accord respect to one with so little respect for herself.  Her joy at seeing her brother after a passage of three years is palpable.  Usually Lois Smith is all ham, a mile wide.  In everything from EAST OF EDEN to FOXES to AI: ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE, directors have tried tweaking that overbearing and particularly gruesome hamminess to ill effect, but here director Bob Rafelson (never better) manages to tone her down so she gives what must be her very best performance.  When she grows sexually and emotionally attracted to her father's (male) nurse, a man with nothing to redeem him except a big wrestler's body, we watch her voyage from child to woman with a mixture of shock and total identification.

If only the rest of the movie was as consistently good as the scenes in which Lois Smith gives such a good performance.  I found Susan Anspach's performance to be spectacularly awful.  Her hair!  Her overbite!  That weird little voice, like the sound of a small mouse moving quietly through a cutlery drawer!  Her outfits!  Her passion for Ralph Waite AND for Jack Nicholson, two brothers of very different stripes.  I remember how, years after FIVE EASY PIECES became a museumn piece, Anspach revealed that she had enjoyed an affair with Nicholson during the shooting of the film, an affair that resulted in a pregnancy and the birth of a baby, which she kept secret from the world press for decades.  Good for her, but oh my, is she lousy here and what a shame, because the whole movie revolves around the possibility that Bobby, Nicholson's character here, might actually find true love, and when we watch his heart being broken we just scratch our heads and go, what's all this meshugina about Susan Anspach?

The detached former classical pianist shows loyalty is not his forte and makes a pass at his brother's fiancee, played by Susan Anspach. Finally home has been too much for him, and he takes off for the open- road, and the famous diner scene in which he frustatingly fails to successfully order a chicken- salad sandwich.
Are we to admire and sympathize with the hero, when he is in a way a creep, if nonetheless a charming creep? What symbolic meaning are we to make out of this dysfunctional American family who seem more at war with each other than in intimate connection with each other?

Nicholson plays it well, as do Karen Black and Susan Anspach.
Nonetheless I cannot help but being my old square self. I admit I simply found the Nicholson appallingly babyish, self- indulgent and non-sympathetic.

You just feel sad and frustrated after watching it, because it doesn't reflect life as it really is, or at the very least, it doesn't give a full view of life, just the small, mean, petty, grimy, sordid vision of one unhappy screenwriter who thinks they're being deep and insightful.",1140307200,11,686,5.107142857142857
508835,5,6302757096,"This is probably my most favorite movie ever, but I would like to point out to all the people, including the official amazon.com review, that IT ISN'T TEXAS! The movie was filmed in Kern County- specifically Bakersfield, California. Nowhere in the movie does it imply that it is Texas, and in fact locals will recognize many landmarks from the 70's, including I think it is 19th Street with the Hub (where we all bought western clothing and boots), the pawn shops, and the porn shops. The turn-off where Bobby gets caught up playing a piano on the back of the pick-up truck is to Shafter, CA, one of the small dust-bowl era farm towns in Kern County. The bowling alley was Freddy's Top of the Hill on Union Avenue, where we all went bowling in high school. Bobby works not in the Texas oilfields, but in the oilfields, now for the most part non-producing (although the oil supposedly is still there, just being held for economic reasons), that are located out near Taft. Now that that is cleared up- the movie itself is incredible and in my opinion Nicholsons' best and most raw acting, without the goofy cliche crazy Nicholson schtick that characterizes his later work. His scene with his father before he leaves is pure, open, painful emotion- and one of the best performances on-screen of any actor, ever.",1134691200,14,1308,4.691304347826087
508836,5,6302757096,"Originally released in 1970, ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a spellbinding character study and a landmark film that remains one of the most powerful and thoroughly excellent accomplishments in the history of cinema.

""Five Easy Pieces"" unfolds very gradually--even after the first 45 minutes or so, it's very much unclear where the film is ultimately headed.  That might sound like a recipe for boredom with most movies, but ""Five Easy Pieces"" carries on with a low-key intensity, and with lots of surprises, keeping us glued to the screen.

Of course, a huge part of why we remain glued to the screen is because of the truly phenomenal, awe-inspiring lead performance from Jack Nicholson.  Jack protrays the tempermental and ultimately directionless Robert Eroica Dupea, a man who walked away from his life as a concert pianist, seemingly because he simply can't commit to anything.  Nicholson has every nuance of this deceptively complex character nailed, and his screen presence is simply beyond words.  It really is hard to imagine any other actor pulling off this role as effectively as Jack does.

Near the end of the movie comes the scene where Robert takes his father out to the shoreline--the father is ailing, wheelchair-bound, and can no longer speak following two strokes.  This scene, wrenchingly performed by Nicholson, is essentially the emotional climax of the film.  Bobby Dupea is a man who, unable to please his father, has wandered off course, and finds comfort only in running away from everything.  Where he goes doesn't matter to him, as long as its away.  And in the end, we find that we really do sympathize with Robert Dupea, with thanks again to Nicholson's superb acting.  The movie's ending is hardly a happy one, but it's perfectly in line with the Nicholson character, and it is a haunting, brilliant way to bring closure to the film.

Additionally working to this film's advantage is the complete and utter lack of a musical score, which really suits the movie's bleak reality, making it even more powerful.

As somber as the movie is, there are certainly some gloriously funny bits as well.  Nicholson is simply mesmerising in the riotous and infamous 'chicken salad scene'--it doesn't get anymore compulsively watchable than this.

On the one hand, Nicholson's performance carries this movie--after all, he's in every single scene.  However, there are numerous superb supporting performances.  Karen Black plays Bobby's needy 'girlfriend' Rayette, a waitress who worships country-western singer Tammy Wynette--Black perfectly portrays the kind of well-meaning but ditzy type who is willing to forgive their boyfriend for almost anything.  Also unforgettable is Susan Anspach--she plays Catherine, and is attracted to Bobby at first, and then goes on to be something of a voice of reason to him.  Helena Kallianiotes is hilarious as the airheadedly 'deep' Palm Apodaca, Lois Smith is wonderful as Robert's sister Partita, and Billy Green Bush is extremely good as Robert's co-worker and friend of sorts Elton.  And in a bit part, Lorna Thayer proves to be a perfect foil for Jack as the waitress in the aforementioned restaurant scene.

By all means, the film's screenplay is marvelous.  It seems that Bob Rafelson, who also directed the film, had the basic story idea in his mind, and then Adrien Joyce was brought in to bring the screenplay to completion.  The dialogue is simply right on the money, containing great black humor.

Some others have said that this movie hasn't aged well--I utterly disagree.  I'll admit that I wasn't even around until over a decade after its original theatrical release in September of '70, and this film strikes me as an entirely relevant and brilliantly realized piece of work.  ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a profound masterpiece that, for serious viewers, will remain forever timeless.

(Columbia Pictures has released ""Five Easy Pieces"" on a double-sided DVD, with one side containing an excellent widescreen transfer of the film, and the other side containing a full screen version.",1134345600,9,4040,5.126717557251909
508837,5,6302757096,"This review is for the 1999 Columbia DVD.

The first half of this film seems like of slice-of-life story about a Central Californian oilfield rig-hand named Bobby Dupea (Jack Nicholson)  who has a cynical outlook on life, mainly at the expense of his simple-minded girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black) and a fellow worker Elton (Billy Green Bush).  More times than not, Bobby exhibits emotional cruelty to Rayette and even worse cheats on her by seeing a ditzy bimbo named Betty (Sally Struthers).  Bobby also views Elton's life with some contempt since Elton lives in a trailer with a boring, TV-enslaved wife and has several pre-school kids.  When it's obvious that Bobby doesn't want to live a life like Elton's, Bobby's life hits rock-bottom when he learns that Rayette is pregnant and then he's suddenly unemployed.  To escape from this turmoil, Bobby goes to Los Angeles to visit his sister Partita (Lois Smith) who is an accomplished classic pianist but is also an emotionally fragile woman.  During the visit, Bobby learns from his sister that their father, who lives in the Puget Sound area of Washington State has now had two strokes and is in very poor health.

Bobby then feels the need to visit his sick father for an extended visit.  Initially, he decides to leave Rayette behind, but in a rare moment of having a guilty conscience, he decides to bring her along.  On their road trip, they pick up a pair stranded women who add a lot of entertainment value to the film with their bizarre behavior and dialogue.  As Bobby and Ray approach the final destination, Bobby insists that Ray needs to stay in a nearby motel while he visits his family and this adds even more tension to their chaotic relationship.  Finally, Bobby arrives at his father's spacious waterfront home in the country which is occupied by an eclectic cast of characters including his father in a near-vegetative state, his father's physical therapist, Bobby's brother Carl, and Carl's girlfriend/musical protg Catherine (Susan Anspach).  We learn a lot more about Bobby from this visit and realize that he's a far more complex and educated individual than what the first half of the movie reveals.  This sets up the second half of the movie with plenty of confrontational scenes between these characters which at times are either funny or gut-wrenchingly serious or sometimes both.

This film was made during the early years of Hollywood's counter-culture genre with movies like 'The Graduate', 'Easy Rider' and 'MASH'.  These were films that thumbed their noses at traditional values with aggressive sexual freedom and a rebellious behavior towards everything older generations cherished and respected.  This film is no different with the promiscuous sex and even more significantly, the portrayal of a seemingly highly educated and talented young man going off and throwing away a promising future as a talented pianist and underachieving miserably in the world by traditional standards.  To the film's credit, Bobby's lack of responsibility is not at all glamorized, and the film seems to convey a realistic depiction of the consequences of his actions.

I can't imagine any other actor starring in this lead role and pulling it off the way Jack Nicholson does.  His screen presence is mesmerizing and so many scenes leave an indelible imprint in the viewer's memory.  Of course the scene that is legendary in the annals of filmmaking is when Dupea orders toast in diner with an inflexible waitress.  Nicholson portrays a very complex and enigmatic character and does it superbly.  After having meaningless relationships with two dimwitted bimbos, Bobby later meets Catherine, a woman who is beautiful both on the outside as well as the inside.  Bobby woos her by playing a very moving piece of classical music on the piano.  When it seems like a perfect encounter both physically and mentally, Bobby sabotages the relationship by accusing her of play acting with her emotions.  But in spite of his self-destructive behavior, there is one critical segment where he breaks down and opens up to his father, and admits his shortcomings, even though his father appears to be incapable of hearing or responding to anything that is said to him.  Another significant moment in the movie is when he attacks a group of psuedo-intellectuals because of their pompous and pretentious behavior.  I can't recall anything about this movie being predictable and the final scene is no exception.  I've seen this movie five times now and there are still little nuances that I pickup that adds meaningful thought to the film.

The DVD is an anamorphic video color format and the presentation is virtually flawless.  A fullscreen presentation is also available on the ""B"" side of the DVD.  The sound was very good, but far from great since there were instances where voices of the characters were hard to understand.  There aren't any major bonuses except a trailer, production notes and talent files.

What bothers me is that he is so unrelentingly abusive, and he believes he is absolutely entitled to his behavior because things did not work out the way he planned. On the whole, ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a very good film, and Nicholson's performances is flawless, but I can't help but think the film would have been a little bit better had we gotten the man's softer side. No, I am not looking for some forced fluffy scenes to make him more sympathetic, not exactly. Rather, I want to see it so that I can recognize some basic decency in him.",1129334400,,716,4.233576642335766
508839,5,6302757096,"FIVE EASY PIECES is a magnificent film that is extremely moving.  While it might be considered a ""road film"" of the 1970s, it is anything but a typical one.  For starters, the story begins long after Bobby Dupea (Jack Nicholson) set out on the road from home.  The audience, thus, is unsure from the beginning how (and why) Dupea has ended up where he is.  We find him ""settled"" in a hick town, working in an oil field, in a relationship with an ignorant waitress, spending most of his time drinking, gambling, and sleeping around.  He does not love his girlfriend and the audience wonders why he is with her, as we see him oscillate between abusively insulting her and running back to her.  He later tells her, ""You know...If you wouldn't open your mouth, everything would be just fine.""  This telling comment, while delivered as a casual joke, cuts right to the heart of Dupea's emotions.  We can tell that his girlfriend, despite his abuse and drinking, is not ""good enough"" for him, though we don't know why.

Slowly, we begin to see Dupea's background unfold.  In a memorable scene during a traffic jam, Dupea jumps up into the back of a truck, pulls some covers away from a piano, and begins to play classical music.  We learn that Dupea was once a talented pianist, a man who has left his lifestyle, training, and cultural background behind and traded it in for his life of loose women, his clingy girlfriend, and booze.  Upon finding out that his father is sick and dying, the true ""road movie"" portion of the film begins.  But unlike the story of a man running from his past, Dupea is forced to run back home after several years of wandering.

I don't want to spoil the film or tell you too much about the emotional final half of the film, spent at home reconnecting with Dupea's family and former life.  I will simply say that we finally get to see Dupea's character unfold, revealing answers to his apparent disgust at himself, his life, and his pregnant girlfriend.  His pilgrimage in the film forces him to confront his past in a way that he probably never has.  There are a few heart-wrenching scenes, in particular, in which Dupea is forced to confront his father and his girlfriend (and his feelings towards both of them).  These scenes alone make FIVE EASY PIECES worth watching.

Jack Nicholson's performance is simply amazing in this film.  In 1970, he was definitely at the height of his game, and his game is very good.  Nicholson manages to breathe life and complexity into Dupea, a character who does not come of with our full approval, nor our total disapproval.  Ultimately, we get the perfect portrait of a man who is on the run from his past.  But, unlike most other characters that ""light out for the West,"" Dupea is not searching for anything-he's just running from things that are getting bad.  I highly recommend FIVE EASY PIECES to anyone, particularly to those who enjoy 1970s film as much as I do.  Dupea (and Jack Nicholson's performance) is one of the most memorable characters ever brought to film and one that you just have to meet for yourself.",1128729600,5,3083,4.612844036697248
508840,5,6302757096,"This review contains spoilers.

Jack Nicholson plays an oil rigger who, after hearing about his father's faltering health, returns to a past he's always been escaping from with a girlfriend from a, let's just say, very different class than his family.  Sound familiar?  This movie is nothing like what you're thinking of.

Back-dropped against a story of a disenchanted man who has to become abusive to cope with his inability to look at himself is a road-journey involving the clash between Tammy Wynette and classical music, both literally and figuratively.  Here his a man who escaped the blase world of self-serving pseudophilosophy and strict Classical design to hide in a world of redneck trailer trash, and finds that he rather hates both.  Behind the character of Bobby is so much of an alienating world, backed up by ever crazier characters and the worst conceits of both worlds represented by the music.  While his girlfriend, the terrible Rayette, listens to the worst country music in existence (and that's pretty bad), everyone asks Bobby why he stopped playing Classical piano... and it's because he doesn't feel for it the way they feel he should.

This film contains more than its fill of powerful and perfectly done moments.  When Bobby lashes out against the woman discussing class in only the most arrogant of way, the audience feels catharsis.  When Bobby sits at the dinner table, finally seeing his girlfriend the way he wouldn't admit to himself she was, the audience feels uncomfortable.  And when Bobby tries to escape, the audience feels hope.  A movie capable of engaging the viewer so perfectly and exacting everything is certainly worthy of praise.

The film itself has the feel that most independant films of today wish they could have.  Handheld cameras compliment crane shots and, most importantly, are used when they should be to incite the perfect in response and symbolism.  The acting and writing perfectly compliment the directing and editing, and none of it comes close to the realm of pretention or preaching.  It's almost hard to see this film as a movie but an experience, seeing a guy that normally would be hated by Hollywood and see his internal struggles in ways most filmmakers only wish they could reach.

He goes back home when he learns his father is dying, and we see the claustrophobia he had to escape from. Nicholson delivers a powerful performance as this malcontent who can't seem to fit in anywhere. No actor ever played the role of a character caught in the web of his own creations, fighting to get free but unable to, than Nicholson. When he gets into a rage, usually against nothing in particular and everything in general, he becomes electrifying. This remains his best screen performance after that of Jake Gittes in CHINATOWN. Karen Black is also excellent as the airhead bimbo he's attached to - until the end when he leaves her in a gas station and lights out on his own. One of the best pictures of the 1970s.

Then he get out, goes back inside and very calmly says, ""Rayette, you wanna come with me?""
The other one is in a roadside caf when the laconic waitress won't alter the menu selections by one jot - and again he comes unglued as only Nicholson can do when he's at the top of his performance, which he usually is.

508870,5,6302757096,"This is one of my favorite films.

A depiction of the two conflicting lifestyles of one man is what ""Five Easy Pieces"" depicts. Bobby Dupea's downfaults have led him to a less rewarding life than what he could have potentially had. This is exposed even in the two main female interests of Bobby Dupea in the film. His girlfriend Rayette ; a loving yet simple Tammy Wynette-singing country waitress that he cheats on unjustly. Then there is Catherine; a sophisticated , intelligent , classically trained musician. Catherine is a partial reflection of what his life could have been and in the end of the film he is caught between returning to his ho-hum red neck life that he currently leads to returning to and embracing a richer life he should have had with a much more sophisticated woman that he sincerely loves.
  There are classic moments in this film that I don't really need to go over because we already know them but for me the film becomes more intriguing when he finally arrives at the island to visit his ill father and encounters Catherine.
  I like to believe that at the very end of the film that he is returning back to the island to win Catherine and start a new life with her but , knowing the character of Bobby Dupea , he's probably running away from his current life to a completely new and uncertain one and that is the tragedy of Bobby Dupea; he is running away....again. Where he is going we don't truely know. We can only assume.
  This film is deceptively complex because of the dynamic humanistic detail thats shown of all the characters in this film and how they relate to one another.

508871,3,6302757096,"""Five Easy Pieces"" is a contemparary American adaptation of Jesus Christ's best-known parable, ""The Prodigal Son"", but with a profoundly different ending. This is a modern day morality play dramatizing the war that rages inside every human between the spirit and the flesh with the stakes being either the salvation or the damnation of man's eternal soul.  Released in 1970, the film achieved a near cult status among the ""Baby Boomers"" who were humored by Jack Nicholson's particular talent for portraying the post-modern ""antihero"" with a snide and cynical attitude towards middle class American values. Although the film appears a bit dated now, the ominous message it delivers on personal self-destruction is perhaps even more relevant today in an increasingly permissive culture given over to consumption and pleasure seeking.
The film opens with the prodigal, Bobby Dupea (Jack Nicholson), working in capitalism's equivalent to the Biblical pig sty - the gritty, sweaty environment of an oil-drilling field (oil being the product of decayed plant and animal matter).Music plays an important role in the story as it represents Spirituality.  The opening scenes are accompanied by Tammy Wynette's classic, ""Stand By Your Man"".  While this song has been vilified by feminists as being humiliating to women, it perfectly conveys how love on the spiritual level is so paradoxical to the carnal man.  To paraphrase Jesus' message, ""If you want love, give love..and keep giving love though none is being returned"", and ""If you seek the honor and respect of others, practice humility, self-sacrifice and quiet servitude"".  As the film progresses, we learn that the prodigal was once a musical prodigy but, for reasons unknown, has decided to run away from his calling to live as a common laborer.  In effect, he has abandoned Spirituality and is in pursuit of Carnality.  The movie's title has a dichotomous nature: is it referring to musical pieces, or (in the vulgar colloquialism) ""pieces of ...""?  While ""slumming"" with the working class, he employs his wits and his good looks to keep earning paychecks and attracting different women to satisfy his lust. After learning that he has impregnated his live-in girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black), the prodigal immediately drops the facade of being a footloose and carefree drifter and sees the need to escape responsibility by returning to his old way of life, though he really doesn't want to.  As Bobby is about to drive off and abandon Rayette and their unborn child, the physical manifestation of the war which is raging inside of him between Spirituality and Carnality is dramatically portrayed in a maniacal thrashing he applies to the steering wheel.  Conceding that he does have affections for another human being and a modicum of decency left, Bobby decides to let Rayette come along with him.  The journey home concludes with a ferry boat ride to a Puget Sound island.  This evokes the age-old literary technique of a water voyage to the afterlife.  When he reaches home, Bobby enters a dimension where time stands still.  The house has an aura of quiet solemnity and is filled with furniture and appliances which haven't changed since it's initial habitation.  Obviously, this house and it's inhabitants have never experienced ""the dawning of the Age of Aquarius"" and ""The New Morality"" that permeates the rest of the world.  Here, the family he deserted is still pursuing musical careers (Spirituality).  Whereas the Biblical parable features a joyous father who comes running to greet his returning son, Bobby's father (a former musical conductor) has suffered a stroke which has left him a mute paraplegic in a wheel chair. He is now totally incapable of even acknowledging his son's presence, much less offer Bobby the forgiveness he seeks.  His older brother, Karl, has assumed control of the house and he (like the brother in the parable) isn't one to let desertion of duty go unacknowledged.  Even in this realm of the spiritual, Bobby is completely given over to the carnal as he has illicit sex (loveless and meaningless) with Karl's live-in student, Catherine (Susan Anspach).  Recognizing that he is totally out of place in his own family's home, Bobby is forced back on the road with his pregnant girlfriend. Coming face-to-face with the reality that Carnality has snared him in a web he cannot escape, Bobby ditches Rayette and his car at a gas station by hitching a ride with a trucker.  The trucker is hauling what were once proud and majestic trees, but are now dead timber on their way to a lumber mill for destruction (for coffins?).
The last lines of dialogue are very telling:
Truck Driver talking to Bobby: ""Haven't you got a coat or something? I've got a jacket in the back here.""
Bobby: ""No. That's OK. I'll be alright"".
Truck Driver: ""Suit yourself. Where we're heading it's going to get colder than HELL"". The movie ends with the sound of the truck going through gears.  No music. No Spirit.  A man with a dead soul must live out his life until the flesh he has given over to ages, dies and decays into nothingness.
The moral of the story: if you are counting on God being the joyous and running father of the Biblical parable, you better not be living a life that burns all of your spiritual ""bridges"" back home or else you will find God to be a mute paraplegic who doesn't even acknowledge your existence.",1059868800,30,5390,4.971078976640712
508916,5,6302757096,"This film provided one of the first demonstrations of the sheer emotional power of Jack Nicholson as a force of nature, a power unlikely to veer course based on the actions of other human beings. Given this, this part of estranged classic pianist Bobby Dupea is a tour de force, an examination of just how difficult and angst-filled attempting to live a life of meaning in the time frame of the turbulent 1960s can be. Dupea is estranged not only from his high-brow family of cultured and well-placed affluent musicians living along the Pacific coast in the Northwest, but is estranged from everything he personally found so unacceptable about almost every element of his existence.

When the film opens Nicholson's character is working as a laborer in a southwestern dustbowl, scratching together a trailer-trash existence together with his hapless and emotionally challenged girlfriend, played to perfection by Karen Black. One immediately recognizes the level of inner-directed anger and consequent fits of uncontrollable rage that Bobby has to deal with, and despite all his attempts to simply ignore and block out the inner demons that drive him to distraction, he is losing the battle to wall out the noise coming from inside his head. His girlfriend is pregnant, ready to get serious and settle down, and the idea of such smarmy normality fills Bobby with undisguised disgust. As their relationship spins toward its inevitable unhappy conclusion, Bobby gets a cryptic emergency message to return home. His father appears to be dying.

At this point the movie shifts gears, both by giving us a movie within a movie in a very comical, bizarre and entertaining road trip from hell, and then a coda of cultural ambiance and civility when Bobby, now at home and attempting to somehow deal with his demons and his family at the same time, gets involved with the lovely Susan Aspatch, whose character tempts Nicholson back toward the cultured lifestyle and the more meaningful existence he had eschewed, yet reminding him of the innate sense of purposelessness and futility such a privileged existence represents to him.

The most memorable scene in the movie, and possibly the most revealing on a number of levels, is his attempt to explain his nomadic existence to his wheel chair ridden father. While he doesn't really succeed in the effort, he becomes much more understandable and less incomprehensible by virtue of his demonstration of what he thinks and his own level of not truly understanding himself or his feelings. The final few scenes are as elegant a representation of the chaotic and confused emotional feelings emanating out of the sixties as anything I have ever seen on film. This is an extraordinary film, and one I think you will truly come to appreciate for the breath taking work of cinematic art it is. Enjoy!",1057881600,10,2831,5.006369426751593
508917,5,6302757096,"I saw this film when it was first released more than 30 years ago. Seeing it again recently, I was surprised by how much my reactions to it have changed during the last three decades. Nicholson's personality in the role of Bobby Eroica Dupea has become almost a clich since 1970. Then, for example, I was wholly unprepared for the chicken salad sandwich episode in the diner; not so today. That is precisely how a Jack Nicholson character should react. All this is by way of suggesting that Nicholson as Bobby Dupea is not only a stunning performance; it also creates certain expectations to which Warren Schmidt is a courageous exception.
What is this film about? What are the meaning and significance of its title? People continue to disagree about these and other issues. To me, the film is about dysfunctional people who comprise (inevitably) a dysfunctional family. All they share in common (other than bloodline) is a love of classical music. Dupea's life is in pieces (easy or otherwise) and he really doesn't how how to fit them together. As directed by Bob Rafelson, the cast provides a number of excellent performances which are, more often than not, as out of sync with each other as all of them are with the Nixon Era in which they then lived. Most of them seem to have a ""What the hell, why bother?"" attitude. Rayette Dipesto is an exception. Brilliantly portrayed by Karen Black in a performance (then and now) deserving of much more praise that it has received, Rayette is Bobby's pregnant girlfriend. She seems lost amidst a violent storm and desperately seeks warm and secure shelter. He treats her with about as much respect as his character Jonathan does other women in Carnal Knowledge (1971): Not much, if any. She yearns to stand by her man. More often than not, he would rather be somewhere else.
For me, the most poignant moments in the film occur when Bobby returns home and is reunited with his father, sister Tita (Lois Smith), brother Carl (Ralph Waite) and his wife Catherine (Susan Anspach). Only then do we begin to sense -- if not fully understand -- the nature and extent of Bobby's malaise. More specifically, we begin to understand at least a few of the reasons for his anger, indeed rage...much of it consciously or unconsciously directed against himself.
Thirty years ago, there was so much angst in the American culture, not only against the war in Viet Nam but against the philosophical infrastructure of American society. So many of those in Dupea's generation and (especially) in the one which followed it raged against institutions and traditions which they considered worthless, if not inherently evil. Having once shattered all compasses and destroyed all the maps, they then had no sense of where they were...much less where they were heading. Nor did many seem to care. ""What difference does it make?""
Paradoxically, Bobby combines both angst and apathy. Nicholson is among few actors I can think of who can demonstrate both at full strength within the same scene, sometimes in the same incandescent moment. If an actor were a transmission, Nicholson seems to have at least 14 gears and probably more. His emotional range and versatility are stunning. (Consider his performances as S.M. 1 Budduskey in The Last Detail, Tom Logan in The Missouri Breaks, Jack Torrance in The Shining, and Colonel Nathan R. Jessep in A Few Good Men.) Sadly, for whatever reasons, Rafelson never again produced work as a director of a quality comparable with his achievement in this film. This was for Nicholson, however, a breakthrough performance and for all we know, his best work may lie ahead.",1057449600,4,3624,4.865695792880259
508918,5,6302757096,"Bobby Dupea lives in central California, in the valley area near Bakersfield etc. You can see that from the highway signs in the scene where he drives to work with Elton and gets stuck in the traffic jam, hopping on the moving truck and playing the piano. And that's why the conversation is about ""going up north"" to see the rest of the family etc (=islands outside Vancouver). -- And this is where another good movie from the same area, ""Fat City,"" comes to mind: scenery, rhythm, content, colors etc.
But I definitely agree, this is one of the all-time masterpieces. It works in a number of different levels and shows the internal battles Bobby is going through and just doesn't seem to be able to settle, even in the end.

Nicholson plays a brilliant musician who hides away from a past he tried desperately to shed. He is a womanizer, and lives with a waitress (Karen Black) who hates and loves him. When he hears that his father is dying, he decides to return to his home, where he faces the ghosts of his past, through photgraphs, pianos, and his ghost-like father. It's about a man who tries to defy the rules. Consider the famous scene in the diner, where Nicholson orders a side order of toast. The waitress frowns at him, and tells him, ""No side orders of toast. No substitutions."" Instead of accepting it, he tells her, ""Bring me a chicken sandwhich. No lettuce, to tomato, no mayo and no chicken."" She asks him what to do with the chicken, and he tells her to ""hold them between your knees."" But afterwards, what most people forget is the small exchange in the car when he says, ""It might have been clever, but I didn't get my toast.""",1029974400,3,1007,4.569060773480663
508920,5,6302757096,"Nominated for four Academy Awards, this 1970 film stars Jack Nicholson as Robert Dupea, a creative and alienated drifter who once held the promise of being a serious classical concert pianist.  When we meet him, though, he's working on an oil rig, drinking, gambling, chasing women and treating his girlfriend, Rayette, badly.  Karen Black plays Rayette, a loving and attractive, but not very intelligent, waitress who yearns to be a country western singer.  And the sound track by Tammy Wynette, including ""Stand By Your Man"" are a contrast to the pieces by  Mozart and Chopin that we hear later, when Nicholson visits his dying father in the family's secluded and upscale dwelling.  There, he enters into an impossible relationship with his brother's sophisticated girlfriend played by Susan Anspach.
The film moves fast and held my interest, with a wide variety of episodes to further deepen the intensity of the Nicholson character. There's a nude scene with Sally Struthers as one of Nicholson's many women.  There's a scene in a diner with a waitress where Nicholson tries to place an order for items not on the menu.  There's a scene where he picks up two lesbian hitchhikers, who are planning on moving to Alaska.  There's a scene with Nicholson's sister, played by Lois Smith, in a recording studio where she is playing classical music and treated with disrespect and contempt by the staff.  And there's a scene where Nicholson defends his girlfriend, Rayette, against upper class snobbery.
This is a film that works as well today as it did in the 1970s.  But it must have especially timely then and viewed as a cry for independence and freedom as the alienated Nicholson just keeps moving on.  The screenplay by Carole Eastman, under the direction of Bob Rafelson, is excellent.  And there's something about the story that makes us realize that there's a little bit of the Jack Nicholson character in all of us.  Recommended.",1011225600,121,1935,4.953560371517028
508921,5,6302757096,"This was Nicholson's first ""angry young man"" role (you can't count ""Easy Rider"" because he really just played a nerd) and it's evident that he'd found his niche for almost every other role he's played. He's a natural. His performance is layered with angst, passion, soft- sensitivity, self-doubt, and a cross-section of just about every other emotion imaginable. This was his first starring role, and it's no wonder his career took off with such a formidable foundation. Supported by Karen Black (too bad she's never had as good a role since), Susan Anspach and the wonderful Lois Smith, the entire ensemble provides a thought-provoking study of a potentially rewarding life wrought with bad choices. This is very much of a character-driven film, and Bob Rafelson gives the actors free reign, a wise decision. The DVD is of excellent quality considering the low price. ""Five Easy Pieces"" set a major standard for many films of the 70's (and most of Nicholsons's (Last Detail, Cuckoo's Nest). From the standpoint of its historical value, the film is most instructive.

508923,5,6302757096,"How can you not love a movie whose soundtrack successfully intermingles Tammy Wynette songs with classical music pieces??
I like to think of this film as more of a ""mood piece"" than a ""character study"".  It succeeds tremendously as both; but if I had to describe to someone what is meant by a ""mood piece"" I would direct them right to this film.  It epitomizes the early-70s American wasteland look and feel common in some great ""New Hollywood"" films of its time (Jack Nicholson was in several such movies, like the classics ""The Last Detail"" and ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"").  The scene outside the bowling alley especially captures this beautiful grit.
You all probably know the story, so I won't bother with the obligatory references to the diner scene, the hitchhikers, or the truly heartbreaking scene where Robert Eroica Dupea clumsily spills his guts to his sick father.  I will admit it took several viewings to truly appreciate this film.  But now I rank it as one of my favorites.  It's rare to find a film that can take you to a time and place you weren't at and introduce you to people you've never known, yet feel it as if you had.

508924,3,6302757096,"Movie Summary: Robert Dupea is hiding from himself and his piano playing past while working on an oil rig in Texas. He has a flakey girlfriend who loves him even though he doesn't deserve it. He is a rude person and basically unhappy with his entire life. When he finds out that his father is dying, he is forced to return to the life he has been running from for so many years. Once there, is he tempted to enter that life once again.
My Opinion: They call this movie a 70's character study. It follows a piece of the life of Robert Dupea an unsympathetic character who spends his life running away from himself. Jack Nicholson gives a terrific performance as Robert Dupea. The movie is very artistically done and well planned out. I can see it being studied in film school as an example of good acting and directing. Despite all this, I wasn't entertained and I didn't enjoy it much. I wasn't able to feel sorry or care about Robert or his girlfriend. The plot was a complete downer. I didn't believe that Robert really fell in love with Catherine whom he met at his family's house. I saw him jumping from woman to woman just like he jumped from job to job. I didn't get any sense that the thing with Catherine was anything different. She just happened to be from the world that he ran away from. Basically this movie just felt like homework instead of entertainment. I believe that a movie can be both technically brilliant and entertaining but I didn't find this one to be one of them.
DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 as well as full screen, DD2.0 Mono. Both sound and picture leave something to be desired. Trailer and Production notes do little to increase the quality of this DVD release.
What You Should Do: Skip it if you are not into Just Jack or Character Studies. If you are, then wait for a better DVD release than this one.

508936,4,6302757096,"For decades, critics batted around the relative merits of Five Easy Pieces like a pinata: Is it the film that defined late 1960s/early 70s, directionless angst? Or is it an uneven, disjointed flick - some great moments, for sure, but ultimately dated? The answer is both. In the end, the film's merits far outweigh its considerable flaws. Director Rafelson was never this good again. In Five Easy Pieces, he gets the little things right. Many of `these' kinds of `60s/70s movies were unwatchable. (Try stomaching Getting Straight.) In Pieces, subtle images and sounds make an impression: a pained, silent father's face; the embrace of a beloved sister; and the sound of an 18-wheeler rolling away as Nicholson's Bobby Dupea makes his final, quiet getaway. Throughout the film, of course, Nicholson is forever leaving some place. Or someone. Why? He fumbles for an explanation before his father, something about getting away from things before they get bad. But, y'know, that was just the best excuse he could think of at the moment. Therein lies the film's strengths. It reaches for no easy answers. Dupea represents an alienated generation, but an intellectually honest one too. Nicholson was the perfect actor for this part; it's one of his best performances. This was his first starring role after the breakout success of Easy Rider. Everybody was watching to see what the guy could do. So there's an appealing lack of classic 'cocky Jack' in his performance, as if he's a bit unsure himself. His quieter moments work quite well. As for what would become the first of many patented `rebel Jack' sequences? Some work. Others don't. Sure, we love the famous, chicken salad sandwich scene. But he worked that kind of scene to far greater highs in The Last Detail. (Like, have you ever heard a more, umm, unique way to tell a bartender that you happen to work for the Navy shore patrol?) By the way, has anyone noticed that, when Nicholson is really good, his greatest strength may be making other actors better? In Five Easy Pieces, Lois Smith arguably gives a better, bittersweet performance as his loving sister. In Last Detail, Randy Quaid is unquestionably better and was far deserving of an Oscar. In As Good As It Gets, could any actor have coughed out a better performance from Helen Hunt? Well, anyway, watch Five Easy Pieces with no expectations - or, better yet, anticipations - of plot and conflict and you'll probably like it. Once you think you know what it's about, it completely shifts. More intriguing characters replace relatively amusing but predictable ones. The entire tone grows quieter and open-ended. So I could prattle on about `what happens' - Nicholson used to play piano really well when he was a kid, and now he works at an oil rig, and he has this stupid, annoying, pregnant girlfriend played by Karen Black and ... - but it wouldn't give the movie a shred of justice. Major studio films aren't made this way anymore. As far as the title of this flick? Don't spend too much time trying to figure it out. Critics debated it with the kind of serious analysis that's usually devoted to a congressional budget, and the consensus was that it referred to the piano pieces played in the movie. The only problem with that theory was that the number of piano pieces don't add up to five. (I can only recall two, actually.)

508940,4,6302757096,"Five Easy Pieces starts with the symptoms of an undefined disease. Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), a narcissist, works on an oilrig with his friend, of sorts, Elton (Billy Green Bush). When he is not fighting off the smothering of his all too loving, but essentially witless girlfriend Rayette, he hangs out with Elton and his wife at the bowling alley. All the while exhibiting a bizarre moodiness, and extreme distaste at the apathy of these humble blue-collar people. But Five Easy Pieces is not a film about an arrogant elitist, it is a great character study of man who can not, or will not, fit anywhere. We learn that he was once a promising pianist, but gave that for reasons he never explains. A lesser film would have tried to explain why he had left the world of music, or why he had left his well to do family. That same lesser film, tens if not hundreds fit this description, would have pinned it down to childhood abuse or trauma or both. Five Easy Pieces never tries to explain the disease, instead it examines how a man tries to deal with the symptoms.
  The early scenes in that parochial town have a snug appeal, but the more Robert is subjected to Rayette the more suffocated he feels. My guess is, he started dating her as a matter of sexual convenience, and inconveniently for him, she turned out to be a person. Without the heart, or perhaps avoiding the vexation leaving her would bring, he stays in this clearly incompatible relationship. And he treats her cruelly. Clearly something must happen, this is the time that he would usually leave to look for that new ""auspicious beginning"". Two things prevent him from doing so: 1) His girlfriend is pregnant. 2) His father is dying, and he must go up to Washington to see him.
  On the road is where the film really comes alive. Aside from Nicholson's famous ""Chicken salad sandwich"" speech, there's the maniacal chain smoking lesbian they pick who raves about how unclean the world is. She's heading to Alaska because it looks ""all white and clean in the pictures"". Like him, she is looking for that auspicious beginning. Alaska won't look that way ""after the great thaw"" he tells her. The scenes in his family's house touch greatness. If the film is not quite a masterpiece its because the director, Bob Rafelson, doesn't spend enough time on those severed relationships. Then again, Dupea never did either.
  Five Easy Pieces was nominated for several Oscars in 1970, losing to the overrated Patton. It does not tell a smooth story, nor does it provide easy answers, or infact answers period. And because of that realism, it is more affecting then most films. Equally as important is that it has a bonafide great movie performance by Jack Nicholson. Five years later he would win an Oscar for Cuckoos Nest, playing an anti-establishment force of nature. But its reflective performances in films like Five Easy Pieces and Ironweed that impress me most. Here he plays a man who, for years, has been travelling in circles and has just come to realise that. The lyrics of a Springsteen song best describe this character: ""It's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin, and can't stand the company.""",973296000,9,3174,4.6996402877697845
508941,5,6302757096,"Five Easy Pieces is one of the landmark films of American Cinema in the 1970's. Hot off the success of Easy Rider, Jack Nicholson made the  transition to leading man after wallowing in Roger Corman B-movie obscurity  since the late fifties. Nicholson stars as Robert Dupea, one of his most  complex and challenging roles. Robert is a tortured soul. Once a promising  pianist, he left that lifestyle and his family and moved to work on an oil  rig in Texas. Unable to connect with other people he hides himself behind a  sarcastic and icy facade. His only friends are Ray ( Karen Black) a simple,  yet nurturing woman with aspirations to become a singer and whom is Roberts  girfriend and Elton ( Billy Green Bush) who works with him on the oil rig.  Robert, disillusioned with his life and unsure of the future learns that  his father is ill in Washington and travels to see him with Ray in tow. The  middle act turns into a slapstick road movie with Helena Kallianinotes  hilarious as a hitchhiker they pick up along the way. After arriving at his  old home, Robert must comes to terms with his dysfunctional family and the  musical career he abandoned. He also meets a woman named Catherine ( Susan  Anspach) an aspiring pianist whom he feels attractive to and who has the  passion for music that he once had or did he? One particular vivid scene  that stands out for me toward the end of the film is when Robert tries to  have a coversation with his estranged father, who is disabled by a stroke  and wheel chair bound. The nuanced performance of Nicholson as he goes  through a series of complex emotions before breaking down and crying in  front of his father is heartbreaking.

Her character is most beautifully played, and shows very  sympathetic character traits - the first scene when she sings in  the car and when she comes to the family and makes big efforts to be nice, are examples.  The family provides a stereotypical setting of a ""gifted persons"" environment, while lacking some of the heart warmth that Jack's character's girlfriend radiates. I  should know, I grew up in utterly similar circumstances, I had a similar  girlfriend once, and I once ended up doing something similar to Jack's character. Apparently, Jack Nicholson really had an affair with the actress playing the piano player in the movie and fathered a child; the subcutaneous tension between them can be felt. The  movie blew me away, and it keeps doing it.

That night I remembered: Five Easy Pieces, a movie I barely remembered watching. So I went and got it and, hey, that's a good show! Jack Nicholson is as he always is--brilliant. I enjoyed it. I don't like telling people what a movie was about in the hopes that they'll watch it. I just say, well, it's good, and leave it at that.",1521849600,,480,4.344444444444444

This is an movie that only jack Nicholson could make. Its not a fun movie, but its charming. It also speaks so true that its entertaining and thoughtful. Over all its a great movie, very engaging and thought provoking.
You should watch at least one golden era Nicholson movie a year. This is probably the most underrated and subtle of them all.
The theme is about a man in his own isolated rebellion, Living his own life. He must go home to see his ailing father. This puts him in a position where he has to face the reality of his life situation. He has to stop running and go home to see his family. Its a film about life, depression, facing fears. Its rustic and comforting. Its also got a homecoming feel. A little stressful. Its a slow burn but you won't forget it.",1518912000,,815,4.326797385620915

5 easy pieces

Robert, a man who is bored with the the mundane that is life. Who isn't pleased with where he is in life.
Unable to appreciate what he does have in life. What most people search for, love.
After not amounting to what his fathers expectations might have been. You see that he carried that around. The love, or acceptance he didn't receive from his father.
A man who apparently is not able to feel, or love himself.
Causing pain to so called loved ones.
The only person he shows that he shows his human side with is his brothers wife. He proposes they leave and not look back. She refuses in saying a man who cannot love himself, how can he ask for it.
In the end leaving his girl behind at a gas stop, leaving her his keys, and wallet. Headed to Alaska, to find something less filthy perhaps
Doing something right by not continuing to hurt her.",1512172800,2,937,4.288135593220339
