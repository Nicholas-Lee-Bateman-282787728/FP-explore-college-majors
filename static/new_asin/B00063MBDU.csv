However, I did view the original Transmission on a videotape I bought from the editor of the British UFO Magazine prior to it being released to the general public.  The videotape included footage that was very impressive and which I hadn't seen.

I cannot offer a detailed review as what I viewed is lost in the labyrinths of my mind!  So if I forgot what was on a single videotape you can be sure I don't remember bupkis about a 4-DVD edition.  I apologize.

I do accept that NASA footage from space and on the way to the moon shows anomalous objects that we call UFOs.",1376438400,,838,4.286624203821656
