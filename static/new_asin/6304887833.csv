7881016,5,6304887833,"If you're looking for a detailed, superfactual discussion of the UFO mystery, this isn't it.  What it is, is a fascinating slice of 20th century social history: Charming, sad, baffling interviews with people who claim to have had personal contact with UFO aliens.  Not a mean spirit among them, makes me almost wish it was all true.  I wish this show was available on dvd, and I don't know why it's not.  (I have since found out that it is available on dvd from the makers of the documentary at a reasonably reasonable price.  I now have a dvd of it.)",1373068800,,551,4.415841584158416
7881017,2,6304887833,It can't have been easy to make a dull documentary about such a colourful and unusual subject but Robert Stone succeeded. I was not overly impressed with his Oswald's Ghost but that film had visual flair. This effort is drab and predictable on every level. It looks and feels like a cheap news feature on a local TV channel. I don't believe in UFO's but have always found the subject fascinating yet I had to force myself to finish this documentary.,1332201600,,449,4.555555555555555
7881018,5,6304887833,"The 1950s flying saucer scares gave us the first generation of UFO contactees, people who claimed to be in communication with aliens, to act as interplanetary liaisons, and even to have ridden in spaceships.  This 1998 Discovery Channel release is built around interviews with prominent surviving contactees, interspersed with film and newsreel footage from the 1950s.

It is a fascinating film as we try to decide if these people are charlatans, dupes of some cosmic trickster, or victims of an as yet unnamed psychological disorder in which the child's belief in his own imaginary world persists into adulthood.  Almost without exception, these contactees come across as articulate, intelligent, charismatic, idealistic, and - sad to say - ridiculous.  It is a hard combination to digest.

So we see an aging and embittered Howard Menger, still nursing his dream of getting a government grant to build a 40-foot flying saucer, of which we are shown a two-foot model, replete with toy men to show us the scale.  Things get a bit spooky when Menger brandishes a .45 caliber revolver, and boasts of the day when he allegedly scared off ""the mob,"" who were intent on stealing the plans for his inventions.  His attractive wife Connie provides some of the more articulate presentations of the contactee worldview.

Then there is Robert Short, founder of Blue Rose Ministries, an engaging raconteur who ""channels"" pompous messages from an alleged space entity.

We are also taken inside The Aetherius Society in Los Angeles, founded by Englishment George King, where a UFO-based religion incorporates elements of Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism.  The various interviews with King reveal a man who is both charming and delusional about his role in the universe.

The most normal of the contactees is UFO researcher William Hamilton.  Utterly sincere, intelligent, and articulate, Hamilton has nonetheless been sucked into the strange world of the contactees (to my knowledge, his claims of personal contact are very modest, involving no more than lights-in-the-sky sightings).  He is a protegee of Daniel Fry, who claimed to have ridden in a flying saucer back in 1950.

The segments involving Fry probably should have been left out, in the name of charity.  Aging and infirm, Fry mutters a few disjointed sentences before lapsing into a reverie where he begins whistling an old tune.  He seems on the verge of dying on the spot.  This is a moment filmmaker Robert Stone shouldn't be proud of.

Other contactees include Frank Stranges and the late George Adamsky, shown in old news clips.  Several of the contactees have invented dubious contraptions for communicating with space entities, and play embarrassing alien pronouncements recorded on primitive tape recorders.

The common thread uniting these contactees is their belief that the ""space brothers"" are offering a message of salvation for humanity, ultimately a religious message.  Several of the contactees - King, Stranges, and Short - indeed present themselves as ministers of their own UFO cults.  It is a fascinating mix of theology, philosophy, mysticism, science, pseudo-science and mythology.

There is an understated thread of mockery running through the film.  Stone uses the classic film techniques to make people look bad - unnatural close-ups, holding the camera on the subject long after he has finished speaking, keeping embarrassing moments in the film rather than editing them out, and so forth.  There is no commentary, so Stone uses the camera to interject his editorial opinion.

This is an intriguing look into the dying generation of contactees.  It is getting hard to come by, so get it while you can.  Every UFO buff should have a copy.",1177286400,5,3718,5.192953020134228
