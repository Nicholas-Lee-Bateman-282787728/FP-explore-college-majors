8280169,5,B001AXPLV4,"This video of Ray Price (only full length one of Ray Price I have found here in the USA DVD format or anywhere) is excellent.  Yes, the color is different at times but it is still an excellent video.  Also I suspect the video contains two separate concerts at the Renaissance Center as half way through he changes his suit.  They also sell ""Volume 1"" of this video but that's the only volume you can purchase for some reason.  The second part of the video (in this video) is even better than the volume one you can buy.  It's Ray at the peak of his career, he was probably in his late 50's with his voice still being really strong.  If you're a Ray Price fan, this is a must for your collection.  You can purchase ""Ray Price: Live at the Renaissance Center"" but know that that it is only the first half of this video and the other half of the video is not for sale anywhere.  If you're a Ray Price fan, you'll try to attain this for your collection.",1303689600,3,949,4.175824175824176
