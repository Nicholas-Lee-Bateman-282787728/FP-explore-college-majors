1637950,1,B00005NX1K,First off when I first saw DBZ in the middle of the saiyan saga I thought it as nothing more then a sailor moon type cartoon.  Yet that is far from the case DBZ is one of the best show ever but this has been hacked away at too much.  Its sad really and I think if you really want the full story and action that DBZ can give then buy the manga.,1060041600,2,343,3.684931506849315
1637951,5,B00005NX1K,"I am Beyond sick and tired of hearing people here and there talk about how the Japanese version is much better. Say this with me ""It is Just a Bunch Cartoon series"" This is Not a Moive we're talking about.  This is a Bunch or DBZs series that go from Dragon Ball to Dragon ball Z to Dragon Ball GT. People only say that the Japanese version is better because of the cussing and the blood and that's it. Let me tell you have  bought the Uncut Japanese version of DBZ that had cuss words and  blood in it but don't start thinking this is Like  The Japanese Anime Movie ""Akria"".  They MITE "" and i say again"" They MITE have 2 or 3 ""AT THE MOST"" cuss words in a Dragon Ball z Movie like ""Revenge of Cooler"" or 1 cuss word in a 30 minute long episode of the Japanese version of the Dragon ball Z series. You see there are Three types of Animes, ""Adult Animes"" which has Cartoon nudity, alot of cuss words, extreme violence and extreme blood shed ""Teen Animes"" Which would have Violence "" but not extreme"" and Blood shed "" but not alot"" and a cuss word here and there like 2 or 3 at the most in the whole movie. ""Kid Animes"" That has a bunch of silly acting and singing in it with no cuss words or blood shed. These people that say the Japanese version are looking for Dragon Ball to be an Adult Anime. Say it with me ""DBZ and DBGT is a teen anime"". And what is all this about no blood shed in the amercan cut version of DBZ. They have same about of blood shed in the Japanese version. The Only the difference with the American Version and the Japanese version is that the Japanese version has some cussing in it but not alot. Just here and there 2 or 3 at the most really and that is really only in The DBZ Movies not the series but you mite find 1 or 2 in some of the episodes of DBZ i'm no sure. but i am here to say the Japanese version is not all that great. the Only people that Like the Japanese version better are the people that want DBZ to be something it is not ( adult anime) .But the american  DBZ is as fine  as the japanese version.",1050364800,3,2041,4.0

1637953,5,B00005NX1K,Dragon Ball Z is probably the most popular anime.  This set comes with all the Frieza episodes.  Although this saga is not my favorite in the DBZ series it is pretty close.  Frieza is one of the best villains ever in the show.  Although in this season the voice acting kept getting weirder and weirder it is still a great saga.  Also the art and animation in this saga isn't the best either.,1034812800,,391,4.301369863013699
1637954,3,B00005NX1K,"I really love Dragon Ball... I've seen all the dragon ball, dragon ball Z, dragon ball GT and all the movies in japanese (with english text), spanish and what's available in english.. The spanish translation is very close to the JP version. Even the original music is there and no cut scenes.....
The only bad thing I see in the English version is the patheric dialogue and music... most of the dialog has been changed to make it ""ok"". If the japanese dragon ball was made the way it was it's for a reason...",1020816000,3,508,4.414893617021277
1637955,5,B00005NX1K,"Any lover of Dragonball Z cannot get enough, I was hooked when I first saw and saw Goku fight frieza.  It was amazing.  I can't wait for the Cell Saga and Buu Saga also, plus GT.  All were great to watch, now they are uncut and on DVD quality... It's going to be great",1002585600,2,268,3.925925925925926
1637956,5,B00005NX1K,"I was very pleased with what I saw. True, they are edited and some things are cut out. But they give you the story and its something that my whole family can watch together. The only regret that I have is that I can't get all of the episodes in this good of quality. There are actually 531 episodes total. 176 are just Dragon Ball, They are before DBZ. Then there are 291 episodes of DBZ. These are my personal favorites. Then, the last are the Dragon Ball GT episodes. I didn't really like these ones, but they are good none the less. I just wish somebody (Funimation) would make all of them available in English. I have them all but some are in japanese with subtitles which makes it hard to enjoy the episode, and some are just dubbed in English. I'm sure any true dbz fan would give an arm and a leg to have them all in English. I know i would. Hopefully this will inspire more people to try to get Funimation pumping out those episodes, it would definately be worth their time.",999216000,5,982,4.25668449197861

7948036,5,B00005NX1K,"Although many complain that this is the edited version of the saga, I find it to be just as classic as the others.  The voices and music are different from the later sagas, but it does not bother me because I grew up watching these early sagas and the change in music and voices was no big deal for me.  In fact, the later music by Bruce Faulcner is as good as you get.  Anyways, back to the Namek Saga.

  The saga begins with the epic conclusion of Goku, Krillin, Gohan , and Yajirobe's fight with Vegeta.  With Goku out and down for the count, with severe injuries delivered by the evil saiyan prince, Gohan, Krillin, and Yajirobe team up together to defeat Vegeta and save the Earth.  The saiyan does not go down so easy and the heroes of Earth are saved by chance, when Gohan regenerates his tail.  With Vegeta beaten and retreating, Krillin goes for the kill but is stopped by Goku and asked to let him go.  Smart move by Goku? You'll have to find out.

  The saga continues with the discovery of Piccolo and Kami's home planet called Namek.  With another stroke of luck, Bulma, Gohan, and Krillin delve into space to travel to planet Namek at a speed unseen by human technology.  Goku is soon to follow after the long awaited senzu beans heal his brutal injuries.  Far away, Vegeta too has healed and is eager to travel to Namek immediately.  Everyone is searching for the Dragonballs of planet Namek to revive those lost in the battle with the saiyans.

  However, Vegeta learns quickly that his tyrannical master named Frieza has learned of the dragonballs too from conversations on Earth between the saiyans and Piccolo.  Bulma, Gohan, and Krillin's seemingly hopeful trip turns into a nightmare when their spaceship is destroyed leaving them stranded, only to see Vegeta's reappearance.  Hope seems to run out when Frieza unleashes his henchmen Dodoria, Zarbon, and even the deadly Ginyu Force.

  Gohan and Krillin make helpful allies with the remaining nameks on the planet, and with their help they learn to increase their power substantially and learn of the history of Namek and the dragonballs.  With hope running out and Goku still riding through space, Krillin and Gohan have no choice but to team up with their recent, former enemy and fight the servants of Frieza.

  I recommend this saga to everyone.  Get it and enjoy the classic episodes of DragonBall z",1375315200,,2378,4.673913043478261

7948038,5,B00005NX1K,"I only wanted this version of the series because its what I saw on TV as a kid. I like the voice actors better and the music better. This is the version that was shown on Cartoon Network in the 90's

Yeah the fact that its cut/edited kinda sucks but I also own all of the Uncut so that doesn't bother me at all. I just wanted this for the original voice actors and music version that I grew up with. I wish they would have kept these voice actors and music for the uncut versions then I wouldn't have even needed to get this.

If you loved DragonBall Z in the 90's and your an Original fan like I am, then this set is a great one for you. If you prefer to see the show how it was meant to be and or aired in Japan then by all means buy the uncut versions of this series.",1327190400,,770,3.8364779874213837
