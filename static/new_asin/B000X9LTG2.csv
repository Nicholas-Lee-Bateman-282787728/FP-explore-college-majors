8227461,5,B000X9LTG2,"This is the second in a series (The 1st was set in North Carolina). This was shot in HD in early spring.  It is a highly enjoyable series for a fan of waterfalls.
The waterfalls are no less beautiful because they are lesser known--each is like a jewel. Most are
relatively uncrowded.
Visually framed by huge rhododendrons (they bloom later in the spring), and upland forest; each waterfall is described in turn. Other details about the site are added, such as location, safety concerns, and folklore.
The Southern Mountain waterfalls have a picturesque charm of their own. The water wanders over a
complex course of rock fractures, an endless variety of boulders, and mossy fallen vegetation.
