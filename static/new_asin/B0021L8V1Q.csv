3834508,5,B0021L8V1Q,"I know from my above comment it sounds like I didn't like the movie, but that isn't true I it's a really good movie. I just had a few problems with elements in it. Mainly with some characters and story. So before you read on there will be a few spoilers, I might give away so don't say I didn't warn you.

First Iron Man 2 takes place not long after the first movie. Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr) is dealing with the repercussions of telling the world he's Iron Man. Mainly from the United States government and rival companies like Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell). Of course this gets the attention of Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke) who blames the Stark family for stealing his fathers invention and destroying his family. Things go down hill from there for Tony Stark. That's it for the plot except Iron Man 2 is a much darker film from the first movie. The story is pretty good except they try to do to much in just 2hrs. That's really my biggest complaint with the movie. I'll explain more in the next paragraph.

Ok the problem I had with the movie was like I said they tried to add to much in just to 2 hrs. The biggest problem is was the force feeding of S.H.E.L.D. and the Avengers down our throats. Don't get me wrong I look forward to the Avengers movie, but what is the title of the movie...yes it's Iron Man 2 not a Avengers prequel. I didn't mind Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) so much simply because I just love Jackson, he brings life to every role he plays. The character I had the biggest problem with was The Black Widow or Natasha Romanoff(Scarlett Johansson).  What a pointless character, sure I know Johansson is hot, but what was her point in the movie.  She added nothing to the movie. Oh I know to force feed us the Avengers, and from the rumors I read a Black Widow movie some time down the road. Now I didn't mind all the Avenger references. There's one evolving Captain America which I thought was great and funny.

For me what stole the movie was the acting by the main actors and some of the supporting ones. Especially Robert Downey Jr(who again steals the show), Gwyneth Paltrow(Pepper Potts) and Mickey Rourke. The acting and chemistry between Downey Jr. and Paltrow was great.  Then there's Rourke who is reviving his film career one film at a time. He was great as Whiplash, one of the best bad guys in superhero films out side of the Joker from The Dark Knight of course. Some of the supporting cast did a good job as well from Sam Rockwell, Don Cheadle(James Rhodes), to Jon Favreau(Hogan).

Overall Iron Man 2 suffers from what many super hero sequels suffer from. It tries to do to much and add to much. That being said it's still a really good if not great film with a pretty good story, great acting and actors, and really good effects/visuals. So this movie is definitely worth checking out, and I'll see it again.",1273104000,,2843,4.445297504798464
3834509,2,B0021L8V1Q,"I caught this film early and since the first movie did so well, I had some reasonable expectations going into this one. While I don't think the movie quite met what I was expecting, it wasn't all that bad.

The Good: The effects, obviously were pretty good. Pretty much what you would be expecting from a mainstream superhero movie. Nothing really spectacular or memorable in terms of special effects that blew me away, but the effects did their job of immersing you in the story, and that's all they really should be doing.

The casting was also... decent. Don Chiedle was a good addition I thought and Samuel L Jackson wasn't as unbearable as I imagined he would be when I saw him as Nick Fury at the end of the first movie. ((I have something against Sam Jackson, if he doesn't bother you, he probably won't in this film either.)) Also, whoever the guy is that plays they head of Stark's rival technology company provides some pretty decent laughs throughout.

The Bad: The casting. Let's start off with what I felt was the biggest problem. Robert Downey Jr., or maybe it was just the character of Tony Stark, came off as entirely unlikeable. I found myself liking Mickey Rourke's character more. There just seemed to be no reason to empathize with Stark. He's uber rich, probably the most powerful man in America, and his only real problem is some medical condition that he ends up curing later on in the film as if it's nothing. -SPOILER- No... seriously, he literally creates a NEW ELEMENT in about 5 minutes, and this new element cures him. Awesome. Also, there's a scene where he's drunk in the Iron Man suit, firing off it's weapons to show off for a bunch of drunk chicks. Whatever... Kinda funny, but mostly just irritating. -SPOILER END-

Another bad casting issue was Mickey Rourke. Not that he did a particularly bad job, just that it sorta felt like there was no reason for him to be there. I admit that I don't know a whole lot about Iron Man villians, and have NEVER heard of Whiplash before, so maybe he actually looks a lot like the character? I dunno, either way the performance felt inconsistant and campy.

Also, I have no problem with Jon Favreau being in a movie he directed, but this felt a little overboard. I mean, sure he was in the first Iron Man movie too, but in this one, he seems to be around too much and is even in one of the fight scenes.

There is also an actress who plays an assistant to Sam Jackson's Nick Fury, though I don't recall the actress, and her performance was nothing memorable. Your typical ""badass chick in leather catsuit"" flipping around rediculously in fight scenes and showing no emotion in non-fight scenes. Meh, I'm sure that's how the character was written so I can't say if it's her fault.

Editing: There seemed to be a lot of unnecessary scenes in the movie that added nothing to the overall narrative. I don't wanna list them all out for spoiler reasons. This made the movie much longer than I felt it needed to be and much of that extra time was spent either showing how ""quirky"" of a billionaire Tony Stark is, which I felt we saw enough of in the first movie.

Action Sequences: This is why you see a superhero movie right? Well evidently not in this one. I won't say too much about them, but they were, in my opinion, completely forgettable, unusually short (all of them combined probably take up 15 minutes of the movie), and just uninspired.

To summarize, I had hopes that this would be the movie to see this summer, but as it currently stands, I happen to think Kick-Ass, was an infintely better superhero movie, despite it's flaws and moral issues.",1273104000,4,3621,4.532924961715161
3834510,5,B0021L8V1Q,"I will admit that I was a tad worried about Iron Man 2, because, well let's face it, the first movie was so fantastic that it was almost untouchable. I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think ""Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again."" Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.

Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.

Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital!

***SPOILERS***
Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.

His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.

Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable jerk that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson... whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just... mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain,

Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.

So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!",1273104000,37,4539,4.528048780487805

3834949,4,B0021L8V1Q,"My daughter is in 1st grade and has been getting into superhero movies.  It started with Wonder Woman (a DC flick) and then somehow she saw Spiderman: Homecoming, I don't remember the details that led to that.  But if she's going to get into the MCU, she needs to watch them in order to get all the background and context.

Leading up to the Avengers, we needed to see Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America.  We also did Iron Man 2 as that came before the Avengers but we skipped the Hulk since it had another actor and didn't have an origin story, didn't really contribute like the others did.

I suspect Iron Man is her favorite MCU superhero, with Thor being a close second.  She likes Robert Downey Jr.  Between the first Iron Man and Iron Man 2, I think she likes Iron Man 2 better.  She seems to rewatch it more than the first one.

From a ""family friendly"" perspective, it's a little annoying that all these movies (not just MCU) feel the need to slip in one or two profanities just to cement a PG-13 rating.  I mean, I'm not profanity-adverse but I'm not in a hurry to expose a 6 year old to that language yet (not to mention her 3 year old sister watches them with her).

3835378,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Really enjoy this series. Robert Downey is perfect for the role. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the use of women as things. While I appreciate that had been one of Tony's downfalls it is possible to show him that way without doing it in the movie to the actresses involved. Kind of funny we point that out as his bad, but the movie itself is no better in that regard.  We always love the hero - the more honorable the more we love him (or her for that matter). We love when he treats Pepper right....  Back to the story - - pure fun.",1499385600,,547,4.009174311926605

3835571,5,B0021L8V1Q,"This is my favorite Iron Man film, I like them all, but this one I keep watching over & over, whereas the first film was more of a serious tone, this one has more of a summer blockbuster feel to it, Robert Downey Jr. is cast perfectly & Mickey Rourke was great as Whiplash, Samuel L. Jackson makes his debut as Nick Fury as does Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow & this one leads directly into 2011's ""Thor"" which leads into 2012's ""The Avengers""......all three are cool to watch back to back & Sam Rockwell makes for a great advasary to Iron Man as well......Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard from the first film & is a lot better as the voice of reason when Tony Stark doesn't take things  as seriously as he should, there is also a subplot about the U.S. Government feeling that Tony Stark/Iron Man is a danger to national security only to have him remind them that he has helped reduce terrorism to a great degree......only Downy Jr. could pull off a snarky remark like that, all in all the best one hands down.",1489881600,7,1018,4.414893617021277

3835615,4,B0021L8V1Q,"In one sentence Iron Man II works for the same reason that Iron Man I worked. Robert Downey Jr. lives the role. He is Tony Stark to the tips of the controls in his Ironman gauntlets.

The nice thing about a sequel super hero movie is that you are free from all the standard origins stuff. What comes next is the fundamental problem of all super heroes, from Achilles to Sherlock Homes to Superman. If nothing can beat the superhero and esp if the good guy is going to win, what makes the story other than predictable?
1. Samsons Hair - Give the super hero a weakness. Iron Mans battery life, and access to his armor. It also helps if you have a credible villain. Nicely done to a blood thirsty T by Ivan Vanco (Mickey Rourke) with very cold back up money man Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and a Army of almost Iron Men.
2. Distracting sub-plots  Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltro) played with the right sense of fun as love interest  and modern no nonsense business woman and Natasha Romanoff AKA The Black Widow Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Scarlett Johansson) A truly modern strong woman role, a Kick A kinda woman and it is not just Toney who wishes Pepper would get one- for him too.

Adding in SHIELD was mostly a matter of pushing the next Marvel Comics live action series, but they fit the plot. IM II is an action movie so why even worry about the plot. It moves nicely and hangs together about as well as any other action movie.

A nice hour plus of mostly mindless entertainment. Enough things happen between action sequences to keep the mind from picking out flaws.  Having Robert DowneyJr.  helps to make it easier for the cast to turn in good performances. The special effects lights do not so much twinkle as flash. Things tear and explode as well or better than some other special effects movies.
Most likely you know if this is the kind of movie you watch once or want on your shelves. I have it on mine.",1489276800,,1907,4.415954415954416

3835750,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Not only are the action sequences of this movie great, but the story line is intriguing and very well-paced.  Robert Downey Jr plays this part perfectly, and is one of the best castings of the Marvel series, imho.  I love how they sprinkle the Avengers themes throughout the movie setting the stage for that franchise.  This is also one of the few movies/franchises in Hollywood where the rich person is NOT the villain, but instead is the champion, innovator, entrepreneur, and embraces the idea that being successful can actually be to the good of mankind.  I get tired of the stereotypical ""rich people are evil"" narrative.",1485820800,,626,4.877358490566038

3835995,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man 2 didn't have the impact that Iron Man did.  Add to that Terrance Howard's departure and replacement by Don Cheadle as Rhodey, it wasn't as strong of a movie.  What it did have going for it was a lot more background story and well done special effects.  In that department, I cannot fault the movie a bit.

Iron Man 2 takes place after Tony Stark (well played by Robert Downey, Jr.) has divulged his existence and role as Iron Man.  With the unlimited resources of Stark Industries, don't you just love how Stan Lee makes them multi-millionaires?, Stark improves his lot and that of Rhodey giving him a black Iron Man.

It's still a fun movie to watch and it definitely keeps the character alive and fresh in the minds while the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-The-Avengers/dp/B008NCSZQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's The Avengers</a>&nbsp;series begins.",1479772800,,921,5.542857142857143

3836130,3,B0021L8V1Q,"In a nutshell, IM2 does what IM1 did but with less satirical bite. What we have here is the same plot line that drives 99% of superhero movies, the only variation being the specifics of the emotional journey taken by the hero. But thats not to say that it isn't entertaining, because it is, within the limitations of the genre. RDJ is as comfortable as ever in his role and he plays the part with a likeable quirkiness. The casting in general is spot-on, although I struggled a little to accept Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, not because of her performance, which is fine, but because I just don't see her in such a kick-ass role. But thats probably just me. The effects are impressive and all the usual set pieces are present. Mickey Rourke gets to do his ageing meathead mumbling, which he does really well, but the manner of his demise in the finale is, quite frankly, lame, and it leads to an anticlimactic ending. To sum up: IM2 is fun, but instantly forgettable.",1472169600,,972,4.528409090909091

3837036,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Like the first movie of the series, ""Iron Man 2"" was fun to watch. (Spoilers ahead) Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man, of course, pretty much drives the movie; and his gift for making us cheer for a character with personality quirks that can be somewhat repulsive (no pun intended) is on display here. I don't think there are many actors who can read Tony Stark's lines and still get us to like him. Even without the added dimension of a terminal condition he has to overcome, it's hard not to root for him during the film. Unsurprisingly, Mickey Rourke does a solid job playing a villain you wouldn't ever want to cross paths with. His Ivan Vanko is not a nice man. Having Sam Rockwell, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson in the cast doesn't hurt either. Also, in addition to directing, Jon Favreau puts in a good turn as Happy Hogan, a non-super-being we can relate to, who does a good job lightening the film's overall mood. Just as important as the cast, the action, battle sequences and special effects are top-notch. Although I've already seen the Avengers movies and ""Thor"", the tie-ins to those films were nicely done, as well. Highly recommended.",1461283200,,1210,4.739336492890995
3837037,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Good, but good lord, is Mickey Rourke frightening. I guess he makes a good villain, because he terrifies me every time I catch a glimpse of his face. Didn't like this movie nearly as much as the first.",1461196800,,201,4.315789473684211
3837038,5,B0021L8V1Q,The movie? Great. The quality of rented movies from Amazon? Awful.. I guess it's just a sales tactic to get you to buy the movie so you can actually see what's going on the whole time.,1461110400,,184,4.138888888888889

3837099,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Released in 2010, Iron Man 2 naturally continues where 2008s Iron Man left off. With the knowledge that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is also Iron Man being made public, he must contend with serious heart problems, Daddy issues, alcoholism, a competing rat (Sam Rockwell), a mysterious new employee (Scarlett Johansson), a personal assistant who is now CEO and who also loves him (Gwyneth Paltrow), a friend who becomes a War Machine (Don Cheadle), Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) and a vengeful Russian with ties to his father's legacy (Mickey Rourke).

I like this sequel better than the popular original because I generally don't like origin stories, as far as superhero movies go. More than that, Iron Man 2 brims with confidence and is just full of kinetic entertainment from beginning to end, highlighted by a rockin soundtrack and some curvy cuties, most notably Scarlett as The Black Widow (the characters film debut). On top of this, the writers add some meatier elements to the table, like Tonys father/son issues and his sad struggle with alcoholism (which comes straight from the 80s comics, the first superhero to be depicted with this problem).

The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and New York City.

The most mind boggling part was even after getting so/so reviews and Capt America :The Winter Soldier getting incredible reviews and considered by many (myself included) considering Cap 2 as the ""Best"" Stand alone MCU film and i think the best period, Iron Man 2 & 3 still had bigger box office success proving ""nice guys do actually finish last"" and the real cherry on top is Downey will make 3-4x the money that Evans will in his Captain America :Civil War film!! IRON MAN 2 had its moments, Adding Black Widow to the MCU,  Cheadle taking over as  Rhodey which it seems many fans prefer but im sorry there still is very little chemistry between Downey & Cheadle while Downey & Howard had more screen chemistry in one scene than Cheadle & Downey is now 3-4 films now & Rourke s ""Whiplash"" is another C- Marvel Villan and outside of Loki and Winter Soldier ""who I cant call true villans, although Loki is at least a villan 80% of the time"" Marvel continues to struggle in that dept.",1454371200,,1072,4.436548223350254

3837958,1,B0021L8V1Q,"So I did a Marvel movie marathon recently, and after liking the first Iron Man, I was looking forward to the sequel. But, I was not too sure about this one, and I was right, I really hate this movie, a waste of time! I only watched the first 20 minutes before I popped out the DVD of this! The Stark Expo looked like a terrible Comic Con, with all the pomp and circumstance, Black Widow's hair looks awful (not to mention she was shoe-horned into this movie), there's only like 23 minutes of action in this movie, and even Stan Lee's cameo as Larry King looks cheep. So how to I feel about this, well if you really wanna know, i'm gonna have to say it, but, Superman IV, and Batman and Robin make more senses than this did. And those were even worst than this! Overally, I think this is not the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with Iron Man 3 (which I haven't see yet, but I heard it wasn't that good). If you want, you can ether pick it up as a rental, or don't watch it at all! End of story!",1437782400,,1011,4.085427135678392

3838021,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Probably my favorite Iron Man movie.  I think the movie was fun, had cool Iron Man suits, good action scenes, and was comedic.

This movie introduces more characters, recasting Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle), it introduced Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who is one of my favorite Avengers, and the new villain, Whiplash, was decent, but could have been a lot better.  I kind of wished he was in more of the final battle, but that's alright.  The Mark V and Mark VI armors are some of the coolest Iron Man suits.  The fight at the racetrack was great, the final battle was cool, and Black Widow fighting the villains was cool.  There isn't much I can complain about this movie, and right now, I rank it as one of my favorite movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Edit: I have re-watched the Iron Man movies recently, and I like the first Iron Man more, but this is a great sequel.

I think that Iron Man 2 is a great movie with cool characters, cool fights, and good special effects.  Definitely worth watching.",1436832000,,1118,4.6923076923076925

3838422,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I am one of the few people, it seems, who was only luke warm to the original Iron Man.  So I wasn't that hot to see Iron Man 2 , but several friends wanted to go see it.  I tagged along, and it turns out I'm glad I did.

It's been roughly six months since Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) revealed to the world that he is Iron Man.  From the outside, things are looking up for him.  He's created world peace since villains are afraid of Iron Man.  And he's opening a year long expo devoted to showing off the latest and greatest in technology to make our lives better.

But all isn't wonderful.  Tony is called before a Senate committee that pretty much demands he turns over his Iron Man suits.  The element Tony uses to power the suits (and his replacement heart) is slowly killing him.  And there's a man in Russia who is building his own suit to get his revenge on Tony.  Will Tony survive any of this?

My biggest problem with the first movie was the Tony Stark character.  He was a womanizing, arrogant, drunk.  And those were his good qualities.  Here, they've managed to tone it down.  Oh, it's still there, especially in the first few scenes.  But the story grounds Tony so much more, so I could relate to him.

There are actually several sub-plots going on here, and they keep things hopping.  There was never time to get bored because we were always on to the next story.  Yet everything was pieced together so well I was able to follow things perfectly.  There are some plot holes, but I never even thought about them until after the movie was over.  And I have to give them credit for bring everything together to a great climax.

Okay, so while I did enjoy the climax, I actually think my favorite action scene was earlier in the movie.  The one involving the race cars.  If you've seen the movie, you know what I am talking about.  And if you haven't?  I'm not going to spoil any more except to say it looks amazing.

The one thing the multiple plots did was cut down on the action again.  There weren't too many of them.  Only three really stand out in my mind.  But, like I said earlier, I was entertained the entire time.  And the effects that went into the scene we do have are absolutely amazing.

Also amazing was the cast.  I was actually able to like Robert Downey, Jr. this time around.  Gwyneth Paltrow as love interest Pepper Potts absolutely steals the show.  I was glad to see more of her this time around.  Scarlett Johansson is lots of fun as Natalie Rushman.  Frankly, about the only annoying performance was Sam Rockwell as the head of a rival company.  Yes, I think he was playing the part that way on purpose; it certainly appeared to be the way the character was written.  But it still annoyed me.

I was confused about one thing, and my roommate brought the same point up as well.  We both sure thought that Tony and Pepper had gotten together at the end of the first movie.  This one acted like that hadn't happened.  Since it's been two years since I saw the first one, I could be completely wrong here.

They are certainly setting things up for The Avengers movie they are planning for 2012.  Several characters who will appear in that movie (and their own first) showed up here.  I bet I missed several of them, too, since I am not a huge comic book guy.  My friends were geeking out at all the references, however.

No, this movie isn't perfect.  But Iron Man 2 is actually a nice step up from the first movie.  If you want a fun superhero flick, this will do very nicely.",1430092800,,3512,4.326153846153846

3838725,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Let's face it. I've waited for Iron Man movies since I was a kid. Iron Man II in some ways exceeded my expectations for a sequel of the blockbuster Iron Man, but it wasn't perfect. To have a great super-hero story, you have to have 1) heroes 2) villains. Downey returns in his role as Tony Starks/Iron Man and does it very well. Lt. Colonel James Rhodes joins him as his sidekick in the end battle, which was well-done. Black Widow has a really cool scene where she and the agent of Shield crash a warehouse. It was funny how she cleaned up a half dozen bad guys when the other guy struggled to best only one. Mickey Rourke does an outstanding job portraying the villain ""Whiplash,"" which in my view, was better done here than ever in the comics.

There was more dialogue than action in this one, but that was okay. They took the time to develop the characters. The two women who made the first movie shine were Pepper Potts and Black Widow, who played lesser roles here, disappointingly. Justin Hammer was a disappointing second villain, lacking the strength or manhood befitting a proper villain.

To believe the plot, you have to suspend your belief in reality to accept that to Ivan Vanko/Whiplash could have built and arc reactor in post-Soviet Russia by himself with no government resources or any real wealth.

Once the action starts, it is very nicely done. I particularly liked the end where Black Widow is giving her evaluation of Tony Starks/Iron Man to Agent Nick Fury for the Avengers Initiative. Tony Starks-no, Iron Man-yes.

This is still a very entertaining movie, despite its flaws. This is a case where there is enough good about it to outweigh any deficits and still be considered very, very good. Even imperfect, it is still better than most movies.",1425945600,,1770,4.645367412140575

3838808,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Taking place six months after Iron Man, old shellhead is using his armor to maintain world peace and keep things right as rain for the world. Enter Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), aka Whiplash, who has a vendetta against Tony Stark and wants to see him dead for the wrong he believed Tony did to his father.

Meanwhile, Tonys dealing with issues of his own, namely that the very tool hes using to keep himself alivethe arc reactor in his chestis actually poisoning him, and time is quickly running out.

Can Iron Man defeat a foe hellbent on grinding him to dust while also saving his own life?

Iron Man 2 is a solid sequel. Its not as smart as the first one, but its certainly not bad by any means. The idea of the arc reactor slowly killing Tony is brilliant. I mean, really, what do you do, right? Just wait it out? Unplug? Tell someone? Good stuff.

A lot of people gave this movie grief and I don't understand why. You got superhero action, superhero struggle, relationship tension, introduction of a new heroWar Machine (Don Cheadle, who plays James Rhodes; the part was originally played by Terrence Howard in the first movie)and a new villain with a simple but decent origin story. Adding to that you got the breadcrumb trail that will eventually lead into The Avengers. The cool part is this subplotcomplete with appearances by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)dont detract from the main story. Of course, I won't fail to mention Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, whos an amazing actor and becomes whatever role he is assigned. I love that about him.

As before, Robert Downey Jr. continues to amaze me as Tony Stark. He is that guy. End of story. Never thought Id like a self-absorbed hero, but he proved me wrong.

Anyway, back to the action: Iron Man 2 has got loads of it, right from Iron Mans first encounter with Whiplash, to the big fight at the end where it takes Iron Man teaming up with War Machine to take out robots and a newly-armored Whiplash. What I liked was the realisticas you can get, anywayportrayal of what a suit of robot armor would most likely do and fight like if it was real. It was fluid, yet appropriately clunky and moved as such accordingly. The flight sequences were exciting, same with the weapons used.

What was also good was the humor. Aside from the heres-how-I-pee-in-the-armor joke, which I found dumb, every other bit of joking around totally worked and still maintained that this was a serious movie with a serious hero fighting a serious villain.

What makes this third movie in Marvels Phase One plan great is that while it had its own self-contained story, it was part of the overall Avengers plotline. I loved how the two worked together but weren't dependent on each other.

Do I watch this movie when Im going through my super flicks in my DVD and Blu-ray collection? Every time.

A major iron thumbs up from me on this one.

 Sequels, especially sequels of mega-hit movies, present both opportunities and problems for the producers and directors.  On the one hand, a successful film will have established a brand that fans will follow.  On the other hand, a great film-like Iron Man is a hard act to follow.  Director Jon Favreau, who made the $585 million grossing Iron Man, has it just about right in the follow up, or right enough.
 There is a tendency with big action films to throw even more in the way of special effects on the screen to the detriment of story line, character development and the quirky details that make movies so much fun.  This version of Iron Man could easily have turned into a clone of the soul-less Transformer films, all spectacle and no humanity.
 The romance between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is on the back burner because Stark is dealing with his atomic heart slowing killing him and Potts is dealing with trying to run Stark Industries.  Downey describes a nice arc from self absorbed, dying egomaniac to Paltrows slightly less self absorbed boyfriend.  Bad guy Mickey Rourke invents a super suit to counter the Iron Man prosthetic.  Mickey has a great scene where he dismantles a Rolls Royce with some kind of electric whip weapons.
 The lackluster script as been augmented by bringing in three heavy weight stars to liven things up.  Samuel L. Jackson makes his 13th appearance since his last role in a blockbuster, the 2005 incarnation of Star Wars.  He is paired with Scarlett Johansson as agents of a mysterious organization called S.H.E.L.I.D. in an entirely superfluous script innovation.  Not that we don't love to see Johansson is a skin tight suit battling a batch of bad guys.  Its just that there is no real reason for them to even be in the film.  Except that Scarlett wears the skin tight suit.
 Don Cheadle, a great actor, is in as Starks pal, a serving Air Force officer.  He gives his usual terrific performance.  Jon Favreau allows himself a small role as Starks assistant and gets one of the few good lines not given to Downey.
 This worthy successor to an iconic blockbuster gets a slightly diminished three and a half saw blades.  It is well worth the price of admission.  The PG-13 film runs two hours and five minutes.  The action flick opened locally on Friday May 7 and has already picked up $139 million in overseas release.
 Word is that there will be at least one more in this successful series.  I hope Pepper Potts gets her man.",1416441600,,2521,4.685649202733485

SHORT INTRO: S. H. I. E. L. D.S IRON OPERATE IRON MAN TWO

by

Mark Walt Meredith

 Tony Stark the Iron Man tries out his red and silvery armor: and exchanges it for an even more  updated red and golden armor again.  Tony Stark is having troubles of the heart again as usual.  Tony needs a technological upgrade to Iron Mans heart: except only an updated heart that is even high-TECH-ER than even Tony could invent: or Tony will die by the end of the film!!  In Tonys chest: blackening veins are starting to stand out like when a black  widow stings one.
All sorts of dark veins are leading out from Iron Mans plug-in heart unit.  Tony could and always does stick a giant computer chip of the strongest alloy Tony can into Iron Mans metal heart to run high energy through it but after a while the metal of that giant chip decays and gives Tony metal poisoning.  How can Tony make a metal more durable than the hardest alloy??!  Will the technology Iron Mans father Howard Stark left Iron Man when Stark, Senior, left Tony his factory: be enough to boost Iron Mans knowledge enough to keep Tony from dying in the end?!!?
The answer may surprise one!  When pressures are getting too much for Tony will Iron Mans drinking: make Tony endanger the very people that Iron Man has sworn to defend?  The answer definitely will surprise you because the answer is yes!  Iron Mans alcoholic poisoning is altering Iron Mans consciousness to the point that Tony is putting civilians in harms way!!
The African American military officer that is Tonys bodyguard: Tonys friend Jim Rhodes (Rhodey) becomes the next Iron Man.  Rhodey alters Iron Mans armor to include machine guns!!

3839343,4,B0021L8V1Q,"With the release of Iron Man 2, crowds of moviegoers anticipating this years summer blockbusters
started heading toward theaters. And obviously Hollywood Henry was there with a bucket of popcorn in
hand.
The film finds our hero Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, letting his ego run amok as the world worships him.
Unlike other superhero films, there is no secret identity factor; everyone knows Tony Stark is Iron Man.
The public may love him, but the United States government is eager to get their hands on the technology
Stark has developed. Throw into the mix a rival businessman trying to best Stark at his own game, as well
as the son of a former Stark employee trying to avenge his fathers death, and Iron Man is kept very busy.
Robert Downey Jr. leads the film as Stark, and the role seems tailor-made to his style. His portrayal is
sharp, sarcastic, and has a playful quality that permeates through the entire film. Gwyneth Paltrow also
returns as Pepper Potts, Starks budding love interest and eventual business partner. Out of the new
additions to the cast (which include Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johannson), my favorite player was Sam
Rockwell. He portrays Justin Hammer, the rival businessman who may be on the same level financially as
Stark, but certainly not as smooth (as shown through a hilarious bumbling presentation of his work).
Overall, the film is very well done. Maybe a half-step below the first one, which I would attribute to the first
films surprises and introductions to this clever world the creative team has built. But if Iron Man 2 is our
introduction to the summer films of 2010, we should be in for some quality entertainment.",1408406400,,1655,4.810526315789474

Try the same with Afro American actors and see, what reaction the screen writer would get.

3839492,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Overall, the movie felt a bit superficial.  RDJ did a good job, as did Paltrow.  Mickey Rourke's villain was a weird combination of compelling and flat.  From today's perspective, Black Widow and Nick Fury felt oddly thin.  Justin Hammer I think came out exactly as he was conceived, annoying and mediocre.

Wasn't sorry I watched it, but didn't come away feeling like the movie had contributed much to my understanding of the MCU or the characters at all.  ... with the possible exception of Rhodey, whose conflicted loyalties between the US Military and his long time friend Tony were well played.",1405296000,,599,4.881188118811881

Honestly, Hammer and Black Widow were excellent in their roles. I was disappointed to see the previous Rhodes actor ditched. It wasn't perfect, and these other actors definitely propped up an otherwise so-so movie.",1403654400,,380,5.145161290322581

However . . . I really enjoyed it! I really enjoyed the way Robert Downey, Jr. played his role. Dry humor. I like that. The movie is highly rated so the only value in my review is to attest to the fact that a non-fan of superhero movies enjoyed it. So if you're forced to watch it with your kids. Don't despair. You might well enjoy it, too.",1403136000,,481,4.063157894736842

In my opinion, the use of inappropriate words albeit few and far between could have been avoided since they don't really belong in a Marvel comic hero movie.  Also, the disrespect of women in general (scantily clad and foolish) was not a big surprise but I would rather not see it.  The plot thickens in Iron Man 2 which tease it up for The Avengers movie. Overall it was fun to watch.",1401926400,,442,4.365853658536586

3839654,4,B0021L8V1Q,"As the final Iron Man movie before The Avengers, this movie showed how the pressure of being a super-hero and how that reputation can affect your life.  While the villain of Iron Man 2 is worth fearing, the real danger is Tony Stark's own personality and that he is quick to give in to emotion.  While the science isn't necessarily accurate in any form, it's fun to watch.",1401321600,,372,4.455882352941177

3839686,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I've just finished a second viewing of Iron Man 2, which has raised my opinion of this sequel a couple of notches. (I did like it the first time through, it just wasn't as strong a follow-up I'd hoped for.) Much of this is due to the character of Natasha Romanoff seeming much more integrated into the goings-on than seemed to be the case on first viewing. It was also easier to detect the intelligence Ivan Vanko was supposed to harbor within that brute exterior, which naturally made him more interesting. Don Cheadle's 'Rhodey' Rhodes also came into sharper focus, adding dimension to the sometimes tetchy friendship the character has with Tony Stark. Perhaps most crucially, the relationship of Tony and Pepper Potts, which on first viewing seemed pointlessly strained, came across the second time as going through necessary difficulties, with lots of inevitable stumbling, as it developed beyond what had been established in the first film.

I'm sure not everyone will agree that a second viewing improves things, just saying if you've only seen it once and you've got a couple hours to kill it might just be worth a shot.",1399852800,,1127,4.869791666666667

The fact that I saw the movie on 2 different occasions and still don't remember anything except for the fact that some guy with a whip is trying to kill iron man shows how forgettable and just plain bad this movie was. The huge amount of useless subplots that never make perfect sense along with the fact that this is pretty much a feature length version of the end credits scene from iron man 1.

3839903,4,B0021L8V1Q,"From the hardcore Iron Man/Marvel fans, Iron Man 2 has received quite a bashing.  Of course it is not going to be as good as the first movie, sequels hardly are (not to mention Iron Man 1 was practically a masterpiece in its own right).  While Iron Man throws in a few more characters from the marvel universe, this can be good, or this can be bad.

Nick Fury, Black Widow and Agent Coulson make heavier appearances in Iron Man 2 that may lead one to think this is simply a precursor for the Avengers, which may have some truth to it.  On one hand, it does take some of the spotlight off of Tony, but given the nature of his well being throughout the story of Iron Man 2, I always felt it made perfect sense.  If not, then a little precursor to the Avengers is not a bad thing either, especially since that film turned out to be a Marvel masterpiece.

My only complaints to Iron Man 2 are some slow patches in the story, and an action climax fight between Iron Man/War Machine and Whiplash that is over before the viewer can really enjoy it.

On the other hand, Iron Man 2 is filled with bright spots, especially Sam Rockwell's performance of Justin Hammer, practically stealing the show.  Mickey Rourke does a fine job as Whiplash, although I would have enjoyed a little more from the second act from him.  Despite the fact of switching actors for Rhodey, from Terance Howard to Don Cheadle, Cheadle probably pulls off a better job, and we finally get to see War Machine (including a one on one against Iron Man.

As always, Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, and pulls off the same humor and charm from the first film, even though we get to see a bit of a more troubling side of him this time around.

Action, awesome visuals, jokes and humor, awesome characters - it's all here.  There may be some slow pacing issues and not enough of the good action, but one can not complain - Iron Man 2 remains a fun and entertaining entry in the Marvel series, even if it is not as sharp as some of Marvel's other projects.",1392508800,,2010,4.316489361702128

3839980,5,B0021L8V1Q,Basically picks up the Iron Man story 6 months after the first movie. More of a love story develops between Pepper and Tony in this one.

3839986,5,B0021L8V1Q,"I don't think there will ever be a better Iron Man/Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.! While I was not a fan of the Whiplash story arc in this movie, I really think it is still a good movie because of the relationship between Pepper Potts and Tony. Their back and forth is so funny and cute and comes across as natural and unrehearsed. Plus, who doesn't love Happy played by Jon Favreau! The addition of Black Widow and a more integral SHIELD really started to stitch together the franchise and expand the marvel universe. What I loved most about this movie was Tony coming to grips with mortality. I liked seeing him pensive and genuinely thoughtful for a moment which is almost a complete reversal compared to his usual over-the-top personality. The wit, the action, and the character development make this movie really good! And who doesn't love Tony Stark mouthing off the congressional hearing or whatever?! Overall, a good evolution from the first one.",1388275200,,957,4.771084337349397

3840013,4,B0021L8V1Q,"This movie is not as good as the first one, but is still an ""edge-of-your-seat"" movie in places.  Tony Stark is charming, arrogant and a risk-taker in the first one and carries that forward even more in the this movie.

Worth the money if you like to collect movies as I do.  Have watched it more than once, and will watch it again one of these days.",1387843200,,350,4.1940298507462686

3840019,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Downey does it again and brings to the screen Iron Man. I love the characters and keeping together the original cast. Mickey Rourke is an awesome nemesis. Sam Rockwell adds the comedic elements as a bungling rival. Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg give us our SHIELD  members, that will continue in things to come like the new TV series ""Shield"" (also great). If you like action and seeing the DC characters come to the big screen, then you'll enjoy this.",1386806400,,453,4.6625

I liked all 3 and we have watched them all multiple times, but...

Iron Man 2 is captivating and has become the hero of my toddlers. We are however, let down by Iron Man's opponent, both the acting and costume/weapons could have been stepped up about 1000x.",1386633600,,449,4.333333333333333

3840032,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man 2 sold out tickets to several simultaneous showings during its opening night in the town I lived. With the original Iron Man having taken its place among the best superhero films ever made, and Disney/Marvel's ambitions leaving no margin for error, I thought the era of crappy follow-ups was well and truly dead. It just seemed like the oversights and flaws that led to them had been done away with by the same increasingly efficient film design that gave us Iron Man. Subsequent releases in the Marvel cinematic universe would show this belief to be hit and miss at best. I was not the only one who walked out of that theater feeling slightly duped.

Years later I still have little doubt Iron Man 2 was a crappy follow up. The story was padded with extraneous Shield-related plot threads which detracted from the development of the relationships that had been established in 1. Tony's character was on a hamster wheel, Mickey Rourke was under utilized as the leading antagonist, and the secondary villain was another smarmy business rival in the military industrial complex (this time on steroids). Rather than earning his salvation, it seemed as though Nick Fury rode in on a white horse and gave Iron Man the tools he needed to survive and flourish a superhero (deus ex machina). The mounting tension that came from Tony keeping his impending death secret from Pepper throughout the film was anti-climatically dissolved in a spare scene as we were rushing to the climax.

Despite these flaws, repeat viewings have revised my opinion to one more positive. There are two primary reasons, one of which has to do with the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe itself. ""Extraneous Shield-related plot threads"" obtruded on Iron Man 2's plot on release, but even the mediocre aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe work better when they draw on the larger background and dramatic force that bring the meta series together. Scenes and characters that were cringe worthy at the time can now be enjoyed as clever tie-ins. Their presence here ""makes sense"" in light of Avengers. In this way the thrills of the Cinematic Universe are not too different from the actual comics. In that respect, Iron Man 2  ""reads"" like a comic book in a way feel films have ever brought to the screen.

The second reason is that elements that felt underwhelming only seemed so in light of Iron Man 1. As a continuing story, Iron Man 2 is a complete misfire. Once the protagonist has achieved self-realization in the first entry, the plot should shift focus to a select number of theme-serving relationships and external conflicts. But in addition to the fact the original film's relationships were displaced by the addition of the Shield-plot characters in 2, they also had to deal with the added weight of Tony's renewed existential crisis. I found this continuing focus so annoying that I never stopped to appreciate how well handled it was in terms of the movie's own internal events and logic. Greatness? Not quite, but impressive in light of how crammed the movie was with extraneous characters and plot threads. If more emphasis could have been replaced on Tony/Venko's rivalry and their relationship with their fathers, then this might have been a great stand-alone superhero film from the emotional resonance of that conflict alone. As it is, it can only be described with words like ""good"", ""effective"", and ""enjoyable.""

So overall Iron Man 2 is a good film in a terrible sequel that showed further worth post-release simply in terms of how it helped developed the larger events of meta series of which it forms only a small part. Interesting, if nothing else.",1384905600,,3662,4.890499194847021

I was really impressed and surprised with their (Mickey Rourke and Robert Downey Jr.) minimal facial makeup, proudly displaying their handsome ""advanced, seasoned"" age. I was captivated and knocked-off-my-feet. Their ""natural"" appearance was very realistic and I really liked it! -- (Aging males do not need or require the pounds of make-up females plaster on their face.)

Although the plot was albeit shallow, that's ok with me, for as a (male) Science Fiction based Action Film I do not expect much of an ""in depth"" bewildering plot. The graphics were VERY good AND the acting was VERY good.

And again ,,, Mickey Rourke was FANTASTIC!!! ,,, Robert Downey Jr. is a gifted actor.

The only part of this movie that I DID NOT ENJOY was the PATHETIC and obligatory token (female) exposing her udders, something ALL Amerikan (sic) movies MUST HAVE by decree of the Amerikan bovine which was accompanied by the bogus and also obligatory token (female) trashing numerous GROWN MEN ,,, ho-hum ,,, WHY the Amerikan (sic) Movie Industry feels the necessity to include these two bovine scenarios ,,, in EVERY Amerikan film ,,, can only be answered as such:: To keep the Amerikan bovine (from birth) a liar, whore, prostitute, gold-digger ,,, and bigot.

I don't recommend for a 2nd viewing but if you haven't seen it already you'll enjoy it.  Downey does a very good job with this character, Tony Stark, a very annoying but likeable guy.

3840083,5,B0021L8V1Q,"The people giving this bad reviews must have not watched the same movie.

IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...

Paltrow as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, the director as ""Happy"" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool!

This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's ""Ex-wife"" missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.",1378425600,4,1436,5.025210084033613

3840091,1,B0021L8V1Q,"Truly, truly wretched - a perfect example of how NOT to make a comic book/superhero movie. (But, then, there are SO many.)

Where is the ACTION?! It's over half an hour in before we get to Mickey Rourke's racetrack-electric whip attack, which is the one and only standout set piece in the entire film (and it's still far too brief). Then we spend the remainder of the film's bloated 123-minutes biding our time, meandering through a momentum-less 'plot' and suffering through witless 'witty' dialogue. (Example: ""I've got my eye on you,"" from Samuel L. Jackson - who's completely miscast here, by the way - may stand out as the worst of the worst attempts at risibility.) When we finally get to the thoroughly underwhelming climax, the villain is vanquished in a matter of what feels like less than 2 minutes.

My wife's reaction at one point summed it up best: there's a scene toward the end in which Jon Favreau (this film's helmer) is getting the snot kicked out of him by a guard, at which point she burst out, ""That's what you get for directing this s***ty movie, b**ch!""

The ONLY thing that kept this from being a 5 star for me was Micky Rourke. Unfortunately, he was in it too much to give it anything more than a 3 star because he was a major detraction. The biggest difference between this movie and Iron Man and Iron Man 3 is that the villain is too dark, too serious. There is something sinister but still fun about the villains in 1 and 3 but absolutely nothing fun about this villain. If they had gotten an actor who was able to play bad but comic booky (I know, not a word) than this would have been a 5 star movie.",1376870400,,779,4.228187919463087

3840162,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I thought that the first Iron Man was great.  Struck all the right chords, no unnecessary plot points and great acting all around.  While I think the sequel is solid, there was a bit of a letdown (as there usually is with sequels to superhero movies) from the original.  To be fair, there is a lot going on.  The movie was trying to tell a separate Iron Man story, while also setting up the eventual Avengers movie, and setting up Thor and to some extent Captain America.

I think the two new villains in the film worked well. Sam Rockwell playing Hammer who is a competitor of Stark, but who cannot do anything as well as Stark.  He was kind of over the top with goofy eccentricity as opposed to Stark's cocky eccentricity.  Whiplash played very well by Micky Rourke plays more of a silent but deadly character who has his own agenda to take down Stark that ties in family rivalry and revenge.  The only drawback is that his character spends a lot of time not involved in any action.

The Avengers tie in introduces Black Widow (played by Scarlet Johansson), and expanded roles for Nick Fury and agent Coulson.  While I though the whole evaluation of Stark and whether he should be included in the Avengers was somewhat unnecessary (because it was well known that he was going to be in the group), it was as good a way as any to expand into that world.

I think the one plot point they could have done without was the blood poisoning from the arc reactor in his chest thing.  There was enough else going on that if it was taken out the movie would have probably flowed a little better.  It did not grind the movie to a halt though, so it is just a minor point.

I also think Don Cheadle did a great job taking over the role as Rhodes.  While I am usually not a fan of just replacing out actors in these kind of movie series (the continuity is part of what keeps the audience engaged), I just think he was more suited for the role.  I would have been fine keeping Terrance Howard in, but I think Cheadle would have been better from the outset.

Like all superhero movies, whether you like this or not will be largely subjective.  Even for fans of the genre in general, what one person likes and another person hates can be very different.  I think if you like the first, you will probably like this one as well.  Maybe not as much, but still enough to enjoy.  The A/V quality on blu ray is superb, and if you get the two disc edition there are a lot of bonus features for those who like to watch that material.",1372896000,,2510,4.286624203821656
3840163,5,B0021L8V1Q,This was a replacement video that I thought I had and didn't or someone had taken without permission. Love it,1372723200,,109,4.5

3840167,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Was an OK flick... good to have it on instant video, mainly because I wouldn't want to sit through commercials for it.  Certainly not as interesting as the first.  Just watched the third and it raises the bar a bit.  Nice to see some clever ingenuity instead of just a suit flying around.  Number 2 just doesn't have the intelligence that 1 and 3 have.  Entertaining... just not satisfying.",1372291200,,390,4.594202898550725
3840168,5,B0021L8V1Q,This was a great buy.  It plays flawlessly.  It has met all my epectations then some.  I like the product.,1372291200,,106,4.2
3840169,4,B0021L8V1Q,"The only thing wrong with this movie was that there wasn't enough ScarJo!

3840173,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man has never been my favorite superhero so this review obviously reflects that.  I was, however, entertained by Robert Downey's wit and weaknesses.  On the flipside, if your eyeballs hurt from looking at Mickey Rourke, as mine do, you might not enjoy his scenes.  As a whole, I liked the first Iron Man much more than this one.  But, if you simply want to be entertained, spend the 2.99 to rent the movie.  I would not recommend owning it.",1372204800,,445,4.5125
3840174,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Very good movie - CGI was exceptational!. Plot was way above average, especially for the genre - comic book story.

I think it's very hard to do a good super hero story as the basic story is so well known. I would think you would want to add a twist to make it different from the comics but still be true to the well-known storyline.

The first Iron Man was great - didn't care too much for the last 3 minutes but otherwise almost a perfect 10. This one was a definite step-down but when you're stepping down from near perfection you're still very, very good.

They have taken, to me, a minor-major hero and made him a top-notch hero along with Spiderman! To do this take a deft hand.

Picture was superb on my 46 inch LCD. Sound was great! Plot was good - not as good as the 1st but still pretty good. It was nice to see the characters develop over time. Action scenes were way above average (unlike Man of Steel which did the same thing over and over and ....).

DVD arrived quickly in perfect shape at a super price.

I recommend this - 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10. I would give this 4.5 stars out of 5.",1372118400,,1099,4.11214953271028

3840201,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Here's the basics. If you enjoy Robert Downey's acting, or action packed Marvel superhero summer blockbusters, you will enjoy this.

Is it better than the original? First, how many sequels are? I enjoyed the original better, but in this case some like this one better. My opinion? I'm not sure if this is as much a sequel to the first Iron Man as it is a set-up for the Avengers, considering the importance of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) and Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) in the plot, not to mention the mention of The Avengers Initiative towards the end.

Some people like me are familiar with the Iron Man character from the comic books (in my case, in the mid-seventies). There are differences between the Iron Man I grew up and the one here, such as the appearance and origin of this episode's villain, Whiplash, the skin color of Nick Fury, or that in the old days Tony Stark kept his identity secret except for his inner circle (""Happy"" Hogan, though not Pepper Potts, and including Don Blake/Thor). But if you're not a purist, is this pure escapist fun?
Maybe not pure -- it has Tony Stark dealing with some inner demons -- but for the most part, yes.

If I had a choice between which to see again between this, the first Iron Man, and the Avengers, this would be an uncontested third place. However, if I go to a friends house and he puts this into the DVD, I'd sit back and enjoy.",1370131200,,1394,4.458823529411765
3840202,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Good movie. Not as great as Iron Man 1 or Iron Man 3, but decent nonetheless. I got it on blu-ray and the quality was great and Amazon sent it out quickly.",1370131200,,155,3.875

3840205,5,B0021L8V1Q,This is my favorite of the trilogy.  RDJ's sarcasm and wit is unparalleled in this film.  The addition of Don Cheadles works well,1369958400,,129,4.565217391304348

3840207,3,B0021L8V1Q,"This movie doesn't make much sense and makes you ask too many questions. Can anyone sitting in a hovel in a former communist nation build an arc reactor? Why does the villain wait for Tony Stark to put on the suitcase suit before attacking him? Why don't Tony's suits have any kind of security in them to prevent unwanted access? Why is Happy so... happy about beating up a $10-an-hour security guard. The guy probably had like a wife and kids he was trying to feed and now he can't work.

Sam Rockwell is funny, though.",1369958400,,520,4.416666666666667

3840211,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I enjoyed Iron Man 2 more than I thought I would.  The plot is looser and less well-thought-out than the first film, but it's still entertaining and I took pleasure in the interactions among the characters.  I expected a shrill and unpleasant Pepper Pots because of another review I'd read, but actually found her just as likeable as in the first picture.  She's sensible, patient, and quite forbearing, considering Tony Stark's off-the-rails antics.  All in all, a solid popcorn summer movie.",1369699200,,493,5.049382716049383

I felt like I was watching the filming of the movie on set, as opposed to post production. I could actually see the lighting on set.  Couple that with the horrible story line and lack of truly memorable dialogue, and you have a pretty disappointing sequel to a decent original Iron Man.  If there was a highlight, it was Scarlet Johansson's action sequences.  Otherwise, this movie was completely forgettable.",1369267200,,584,4.429906542056075

3840230,5,B0021L8V1Q,"I felt that this movie was easier to follow than the first one. The villains were fun and complicated, but not so complicated we could not understand who they were or what they were trying to do. Robert Downey Jr. was his usual outrageously overly confident self, but that's what makes these things fun: It's comforting to know somebody, if only in a story, can be supremely confident. Having a situation in which everybody knows the identity of a super hero makes for a different angle from the usual super hero story. Pepper is given a stronger part than the first movie, and we love her for her faithfulness and personal integrity. If there was a weakness to this movie, Scarlet Johannson's part could have been bigger. Of course, that might have made the movie too long. This is a really fun movie. Hope there will be many sequels!",1369008000,,835,4.610738255033557

3840234,5,B0021L8V1Q,Robert Downey Jr. is by far the absolute best choice for this character. I can't imagine anyone else playing Tony Stark. The movie is excellently made. The special effects are second to none. I just hope they don't do to Iron Man what they did to Spiderman by replacing the actor that best replicates the character.

3840292,4,B0021L8V1Q,"While Iron Man 2 may not be perfect, it is a very solid and fun sequel. Improvements include better action sequences and some great characters added to the franchise. Unfortunately there is a lot going on here and even though it isn't hard to follow, there isn't enough time to give each sub plot the proper screen time it deserves. Oddly enough for a super hero film, I think they could have edited some of the talky scenes down and added a little more Iron Man action.

A good example of this is when we meet Natasha Romanova she isn't given much to do and I found myself wondering if she was going to be The Black Widow on screen. She is only in one action sequence (a great one with one of the funniest moments in the film) late in the movie and she and Nick Fury are really only in it to set up The Avengers movie. I'm not saying it should have been edited out, but there is only so much ground you can cover in two hours.

Whiplash is played with gusto by Mickey Rourke adding some real menace to the role, but he doesn't get much screen time either and that seems to be this film's biggest flaw, no one but Tony Stark gets enough screen time.

After the first encounter with Whiplash in Monaco on the race track, we don't really get a good dose of Iron man until the final battle, which means there is over an hour of time where there isn't that much action. Considering what I had read about this being an action packed film, I found it to be very talky. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the characters are well developed and the actors are all really good here.

The final battle is very good with some very cool Iron Man destruction and some nifty moves, but it's surprising and anti-climatic when Whiplash is defeated very quickly.

In the first film, I thought the final battle was too long and in this one, it just seemed to end too abruptly. I'm not bashing this film in any way as it is a very fun film, but I think the story may have been a little too ambitious for one film.

Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B (4 stars) and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered. The 2 disc DVD is loaded and worth picking up, but the Blu Ray is were the armor really shines!",1367625600,,2207,4.169014084507042

3840299,2,B0021L8V1Q,"A good action film has to have more to offer than just its hardware.  And though I risk being labeled a snob or, worse yet, an ""elitist,"" I would advise against anyone watching any picture that glorifies or otherwise romanticizes violence and weaponry. Violence is a part of many great stories.  But films that fantasize violence, obsess over firearms, exalt it, worship it--make love to violence like it was a thing of beauty--are true profanations.  To IM2's credit, the film certainly doesn't glorify violence.  To its discredit, IM2 really has nothing more to offer than its hardware.  The film-makers were clearly of the philosophical persuasion: If a little is good, more must be better.  They knocked their little heads together for a few minutes and calculated, ""If a few IM suits in the original was a good thing by golly, lots and lots more will be a VERY good thing!""  But there's enough silly, redundant hardware in this film to make the viewing experience mind-numbing.  Evil Soviet scientist Vanko (Mickey Rourke) builds so many of his IM-like cyborgs that, at one point, our hero and Col. Rhodes are pursued by a platoon of evil robots.  Now, Vanko's dad helped Tony's father develop the IM power technology, and Vanko can build robots with the best of them.  But you've probably already guessed--and right you would be--that Tony and Rhodes handily outmaneuver and outgun Vanko's machines.  IM was fresh, self-deprecating, funny, and focused on it characters.  IM2 is the epitome of too much of a good thing--boring hardware overkill.  In the original, Downey was charmingly obsessive-compulsive, condescending yes, but witty and humorous, and that was fine fill for one picture.  In IM2, Downey maintains the identical modulation throughout so that, by the end, he becomes repetitive and irritating.  Don Cheadle, playing Tony's always-vexed babysitter, is a poor replacement for Terrance Howard, whose fine comic timing got some of the biggest laughs in the first film.  Rourke has a wonderful screen presence (check him out in one of the best American cops and robbers yarns of all time, Year of The Dragon), and there are certain flashes of creativity such as Vanko's electrified whips.  But it's not enough to save this, as put by Amazon's Robert Horton, ""genre foolishness.""  Sadly, at film's end you feel somewhat brain-devastated, consider for a moment all that money the studio will invariably waste marketing IM3 to you, and think how you'd rather spend the afternoon in a dentist's chair than see the IM 3-quel.",1367280000,,2538,5.045563549160671

3840303,2,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron man 2 is a very disappointing follow-up to to a near perfect movie. Everything that made the first film good is nearly gone from this film. The first Iron Man got praise for being not just a good superhero film, but also as a good character study. So this film had a lot to live up to. While I believe that the creators tried to make something good, I felt that they tried to hard.

They tried to give Tony Stark an interesting character arc like the first film did. However, how he reacts and the situations he gets hinself into kind've sours his development from the first film. I find in hard to believe that Tony gets of scot free at the end of the film despit all that he did. Pepper is very annoying in this. All she does throughout the entire movie is yell at Tony. Tony and Pepper's relationship takes a step back in this movie. They seem like they hate eachother here. Roddy is alright. He's probably the most reasonable character in the movie. Black Widow is well cast, but is extremely underused.

The villians are even worse. Ivan Vanko comes off as more of a nuisance than a legitimate threat. Justin Hammer is probably the least intimidating villian I've ever seen. He's the most annoying person in the film, and that's saying something.

The effects are still great, like the first film. The action is alright, but too short. The final battle is again very anti-climatic. One big problem I have with this film is that there's not much Iron Man in it.

This movie also wants to cram as much Avengers material as possible, and it detracts from the main plot. They could have used this time to develop the characters more or have more action scenes.

Overall this movie is a big disappointment and a bad follow-up. I'd skip it.",1366848000,,1744,4.454545454545454

Also along for the ride are many returning actors, except one, as the phenomenal Don Cheadle has stepped into the role of James Rhodes & eventually suits up in his own War Machine armor. RDJ adds more depth to the role of Tony Stark, as he has to deal with his own technology slowly killing him, as well as his father's past coming back to hinder, but eventually helping him & also the wider heroic world come calling in the guise of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury & S.H.I.E.L.D. Though the movie is overstuffed at times, RDJ & Co. keep it a fun ride that rockets us ever closer to The Avengers.",1366502400,,996,4.448087431693989

I don't watch movies like this expecting an award-winning performance or story. I don't expect it, and am not let down. What I am let down by is the one-dimensional villain (Ivan) who barely talks or even twitches a facial muscle the entire movie. The other bad guy, Hammer, is just plain old annoying. There are too many forced subplots as well such as the SHIELD guys showing up, the ""new element"" part, etc. I understand they need to tie the Avengers together, but for how much the writers get paid, they could have come up with an idea that both integrates better with the rest of the movie while being more entertaining.

Also, LtCol Rhodes is a different actor. He tries hard but doesn't have the demeanor of the first actor. Oh well, doesn't make a big difference but it is noticeable.

I have watched this twice now. The first time I hated it, then my children wanted to see it so I watched it again. The second time it grew on me a little and I don't hate it anymore, but it's still not as good as the first one.",1363478400,3,1241,4.4104803493449785

He shows that although Iron Man is a superhero, he also has flaws.  Nobody is perfect. Don Cheadle one of my favorite actors plays his character with humor and sympathy.
Also nothing like having some new allies to help you fight the bad guys. Plenty of action and not always predictable. I'm looking forward to more movies of this kind with Robert Downey Jr.

In the first installment of the series we are introduced to Obidiah Stane. Loved it, but in the sequel we immediately get Justin Hammer, who is portrayed as a bumbling incompetent. The two main villains are too similar to be brought in back to back making the plots too similar to be interesting. I would have much preferred if they had chosen a different villain, such as The Mandarin as the main adversary for the second installment in the series.

That said, if you haven't seen it, it is worthwhile, though I much prefer the original movie & I have hopes for something better in this years release.",1362441600,,711,4.5984251968503935

The nerd tycoon is a radioactively hot mess of emotional issues, swagger, uncontrolled impulse, and good intentions, and Downey makes the viewer believe in and root for him. For the grown-up comics fan the film sticks close enough to canon, and adds the fun of visually-rich world- and character-building. Tony's Malibu home, Monaco,
and the World's-Fair-like Stark Expo are some of the more interesting settings. This is a full-tilt superhero romp. As such, it isn't likely to share a footnote with Fantasia or The Last Metro in the history of film. However, it is highly likely to brighten your day.",1361145600,,659,5.0

I added this to my ""Pre-Avengers Collection"" with much anticipation. Even though I liked the movie it wasn't without its flaws. Some things in the story wasn't well resolved and the running gag with Stark and the Senator, while entertaining, was a bit unnecessary in my humble opinion. The movie really picked up when Rhodey donned the armor. I enjoyed him having a more important role in the film.

Another gripe I have is I think Jon Favreau made himself involved in the movie more than he should have. I guess when you're the director you can do that. It's not major, but I just really didn't see a purpose of him being in the movie.

However, I was dismayed to see Tony Stark reduce himself to being the a-hole he was before the war accident. The whole idea of 'Iron man' was that he changed his ways after coming close to death. Eventually we kind of see why he goes off the bend and Tony does turn himself around ,although he almost loses all his friends doing so. Hammer Industries CEO was really cheeky and some of his antics reminds me of OCP in the film, 'RoboCop'. I am still glad i watched this finally. Probably worth 3 stars but I give it 4 because the movie does have some great content: Suitcase Amour, references to the comic book,aka the automobile logo in Morocco Race, and some back story with his Father, Howard Stark.

3840429,1,B0021L8V1Q,A superhero is supposed to be inspiring. Presumably they are heroic and impressive. Neither applied to any element of  this film.  Why take a character that was a hero and written as such and turn him into some obnoxious glib jerk you cannot stand to watch?  In the Avengers movie you did not get too much of this character. Here it was just pure indulgence. No restraint. It was embarrassing. The dialogue was fast and empty. It was like everyone was on helium. I liked parts of the first film. I liked the fact that this one came to an end.  I write this to save someone else their money.,1357948800,,590,4.336363636363636

3840433,2,B0021L8V1Q,"Pretty much everyone else here has covered my principal gripes, so I'll just throw in a few observations here....

1.  Story: Not Much.  Half this movie is Tony Stark moping around feeling sorry for himself, or engaging in an ego trip to mask the pain of what he thinks is imminent death.  Needless to say, none of this is entertaining, and for a guy who in the last film repeatedly put himself in harm's way to save total strangers, he sure doesn't seem to handle the idea of his own demise very well.  After a while, the audience stops feeling sorry for Tony and kind of wish he could go to his grave with a bit more dignity.

2. Scarlett Johanssen looks good as usual, but I'm not as convinced as Hollywood seems to be that she can carry a scene with her body.  She's a walking cliche and CGI-rigged ""stunts"" don't help.  Naturally, she must be in a painted-on black suit which accentuates every curve.  She's a gorgeous woman, we get it.  Now please, give her a personality.

3. Pepper Potts- well, Miss Paltrow looks pretty awful this time around- blotchy, and her nasty attitude toward her former boss is really over the top.  There's no chemistry between her and Downey, no matter how much they try to convince us that there is by using a heavy, blunt hammer.

4. Samuel L Jackson- why even bother?  I can't believe he got a paycheck for this.  Boring, boring, boring.

5. Villain- meh, best part of the film but nothing special either.

Oh, and btw- in the first film, Cramer bought himself some product placement.  In the second, it was Bill O'Reilly.  Can I assume that Sean Hannity will be in the third film?  If so, could the director please make it long enough for me to use the rest room during that segment?",1357862400,,1722,4.440894568690096

There are a lot of good parts in the sequel such as the fight in Monaco  when Tony is trying avoid Mickey Rourke's electric whips but this movie just feels rushed. The central relationship conflict between Tony and Pepper could have been solved with a simple conversation of 1 sentence; I hate when movies do this. ""Hey Pepper, my arc reactor is slowly killing me and I need to find a new element to use."" There. I just saved the plot 2 hours of bickering between Tony and Pepper. There is a lot of Avengers-building shoved into this film when they probably should have focused on the story. The fight at the end becomes sheer CGI porn and I lose interest.

However, to elaborate, I believe the Iron Man series has only gotten better throughout it's span. The first one was a great ""How it all started"". Action, acting, graphics, and plot was all done very well (In Part 1). Part 2 was no exception. I expected more and received just that. I've watched this movie many times and I probably will come back for more and possibly watch the entire set when Iron Man 3 hits Theaters!

3840476,4,B0021L8V1Q,"What had instantly become a critical and financial hit, not to mention a fan favorite among superheroes perhaps less known, Iron Man produced a sequel only 2 years later due to it's immense popularity. Probably the greatest thing about the first Iron Man film is that, nobody really knew what to expect. Those outside of the comic book community in fact were not very familiar or aware of the Iron Man character like they were of Spider-man or the X-Men.

In addition Robert Downey Jr. had not created a very positive reputation in the preceding years and most did not know about director Jon Favreau's ability to helm a superhero flick. Well as it would be, all of this rode in favor of the novice superhero filmmaker and gave him the chance to wow the world with this movie. Because movie studios primary concern 99.9% of the time is making more and more money they green lit what was sure to be another money hungry superhero blockbuster and production was underway only a year after the first film had been released. Now this can result in a few outcomes.

The movie could be horrible having rushed a screenplay, been careless with casting actors and performances and an overall lack of quality control. Luckily this was not the case. Although it wasn't as good as the first film, all too uncommon to do especially these days, this was a good Iron Man sequel. I think part of the reason it couldn't be as good as the first movie was because now that we all know how good the first movie was we expect par or perhaps even better. No expectation of the first film gave it the opportunity to blow us away.",1356393600,,1606,4.515463917525773

3840501,2,B0021L8V1Q,"Sorry, I know a lot of people really liked this movie. I'm guessing though that it was just because they liked the first Iron Man movie so much and they were still on an Iron Man high from that movie. Or maybe because they are just diehard fanboys of DC or Iron Man comics.  I don't know why anyone would give this movie anything higher than a 2 star rating.  It was boring.  It moved so slow that when there finally was an action scene I didn't even care anymore what was going on in the movie or what the plot was. It's hard to make me fall asleep in a movie, but I did exactly that in this movie.  Trust me, it is very slow and will bore you to sleep.  Maybe it was becuase I was watching it at home in my nice comfy recliner, but I've watched hundreds of other movies in that chair and I don't fall alseep.  Even some chic-flicks I've watched at home draw me in to the story line better than Iron Man 2. The only reason Im not giving it a one star is because it did have some action and when it did it was fairly descent fight scenes, but everything else in between those couple of action scenes is 1 star at best. I wouldnt even waste a dollar at Redbox renting this.  If you can catch it on tv or Amazon Prime for free and you got nothing better to do for 2 hours of your life then maybe waste some time.  But even then there has to be hundreds of better movies out there that you could waste time watching that would be better than this one.",1354492800,,1448,3.986159169550173

Should you spend a couple of hours watching it? If you have Netflix or Instant Video, sure go for it. Its free. I wouldn't suggest you invest in buying it however.

He always seems to dress a bit flamboyantly in movies so I didn't think anything of it.  And the female lawyer character just seemed to be shoehorned into various spots just because.

Also some weird propaganda in the film.  The US military steels private property and we're not expected to care?  The whole issue of whether the suit is a ""weapon"" with no mention of the 2nd amendment?

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

But Don Cheadle was not very impressive and the dynamic just wasn't there, in my opinion. Even the story seemed a little phoned in compared to the first movie.

3840564,1,B0021L8V1Q,"This is easily one of the worst superhero films I've seen in my life.

I love superheros, because they're tough guys (and girls) who try to do the right thing, no matter what.  They do mess up sometimes (like Spider-man did in the second movie,) but soon they're back on their feet, sobered and ready to make their commitment again.

I have to admit, this is what I liked most about the first Iron Man movie.  I found flaws in it, but Tony's commitment to getting the job done and making amends for some of his past sins made the film a likable experience overall, even though the main character still has a lot of problems which he's yet to overcome.

This film contains none of the atonement plot of the first.  Instead, Tony Stark, whose identity as Iron Man is now public knowledge, dances, sings, brags, drives fast cars, womanizes, gets drunk, tells bad jokes, gets sick, gets in trouble, has a brief falling-out with one of his friends, and generally makes himself a nuisance.  The character (an irritant in the first film) comes across as merely a spoiled, hyperactive man-child in this movie, and no real consequences are brought against him for it.  He's given what he needs to solve his problems, he solves his problems, and can go back to being a jerk.  Hooray?

Probably the worst aspect of the film, however, are the villains.  There are two; a lousy, jealous weapons designer named Justin Hammer, who's even more hyper, spoiled and pop-culture-infused than the title character is, and a psychotic thug/mad scientist named Ivan Vanko, who never displays any dimensions to his character other than ""be evil,"" while paradoxically and insultingly wearing a cross and carrying what looks like a rosary.  Right.  As if I didn't have enough reasons to hate this film.

Come to think of it, the two-villain MO; one a goofy, silly wisecracker, the other a power-mad psychopath, reminds me unpleasantly of Batman Forever.

The main plot of this movie is a lot skinnier than in the past.  Evil bad guy has technology.  Evil bad guy attacks.  Evil bad guy loses.  The end.

To compensate for this, they stick in about four subplots.  The first is about the government wanting to take control of Iron Man.  The second is about Tony getting close to death from the chemical in the battery he's been using for his Iron Man armor.  The third involves Shield keeping an eye on him.  Spoilers; none of these first three subplots goes anywhere.

That brings us to subplot 4; the war machine armor being stolen by Tony's friend when he realizes that Tony is too big of a jerk to leave in sole possession of it.  This subplot goes somewhere, but only in terms of helping to set up a team-up between Iron Man and War Machine near the end of the film; a hero/sidekick team-up, which is reminiscent, again, of Batman Forever.

I didn't mind the first film so much, in spite of its shallow villain, jerky main character and so forth, but this film really has nothing to offer.  Its weak points are just as weak as in the original, and the strengths of the first film are gone.  On top of that, it has a bunch of additional flaws and insulting lines and references that bring it down even more.  About the only good thing I can say about it is that it introduces the character of Black Widow, but even this is only of interest to people who know about the character already.  To everybody else, she'll probably come off as a knockoff of Trinity from the Matrix.

I had some hope for superhero movies when Marvel started making their own.  After all, Hollywood superhero movies have always been hit or miss.  However, this movie just goes to show that even non-Hollywood superhero movies can still be utter train wrecks.",1342051200,4,3708,4.6106870229007635

3840566,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I want to start off by saying that all the people who said this movie spent too much time pushing the Avenger Initiative forward, were kind of wrong. I say ""kind of"", instead of just plain ""wrong"", because, while there are scenes devoted to that agenda, the focus is still definitely Tony Stark and the Iron Man ""weapon"". Robert Downey Jr. returns to the role that reinvigorated his career, and he's better than ever. RDJ's portrayal is possibly the most spot-on comic book character that I have seen come to life off of a page. Yes, Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best, but his Tony Stark is a very close second. As for the rest of the performances, they ranged from adequate to great. I never understood why people doubted Don Cheadle replacing Terrence as Rhodey/War Machine from the start. I never did, and he did just what I expected him to. He didn't overact, he didn't steal the show (although I doubt that's possible when your co-start is RDJ), and his voice fit the commanding character that I felt Rhodey's should have been in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I like Terrence Howard in particular roles, but not as Rhodey. I felt his talent was misplaced. And don't get me started on Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Yeah, she's triple covert, and oh my god. That's all I need to say. (wipes drool from mouth). Gwyneth Paltrow returns from the first film, and she's just as quirky. She and RDJ play off of each other very well. That's definitely a dynamic that I enjoy revisiting these films to see.

Now Sam Jackson just so happens to be my favorite actor, due to his natural cool guy persona. Him being in this universe is enough for me to be giddy about, yet alone playing such a pivotal role in the Avengers Initiative. While he didn't have a lot of screen time as Nick Fury, I still feel like he still did a great job at capturing the character from Mark Millar's The Ultimates. Ironically, Millar's updated, black Nick Fury was based on Sam Jackson's likeness before he even knew. I feel like I would be doing this guy a disservice if I didn't at least mention Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson. He has actually grown on me as a character after seeing him in almost every film in the quasi-series. Now for the villains. I love Iron Man, and Jeff Bridges. While I thought he made a great corporate villain, something about him being inside of the Iron Monger suit rubbed me the wrong way. I just never really believed it, but it got the job done. Fast forward to Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played more for humor, and the jokes often fell flat. He was still a little funny, and I probably wouldn't be able to chose anyone else for his roles but he just didn't serve as the comic relief that he was intended to be. He reminded me of a skinny version of Austin Powers, except he couldn't fight. That's probably not much of an insult coming from me, because I'm skinny, but I'd like to think I can defend myself. It's not even as if the film needed any more comic relief. Tony Stark was the funniest one in it, and his interactions with Pepper, and Rhodey, have enough to supply the laughs. I was waiting to see Hammer get his due because I loved his character, but that didn't happen in this movie. Perhaps he'll be one of the villains again in the third installment.

Now for the main villain, played by Mickey Rourke. Rourke rounds out the all-star cast as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, if that's what you want to call him. Don't get me wrong, he was Whiplash, in essence, but if you've never picked up an Iron Man comic before (or watched the cartoon from the 90's), you'd only know him as Ivan Vanko. He was a more fearsome adversary than Jeff Bridges as Iron Monger. His badassedness was not displayed quite as much as I had hoped, but you still got the message that he was not to be messed with, a few times. I genuinely felt for his character at first, because his father didn't deserve to live, and die, the way he was forced to, after working with Howard Stark to design the very arc reactor that powered the Iron Man suit, and kept Tony alive. It was his choice of handling that situation that drives you to loathe him. Rourke played him a bit cartooney, but he still did a fine job, even if you can't always understand the Russian accent. Sadly, his final showdown with War Machine and Iron Man is so short that you will miss it if you blink. To be fair, the finale in Iron Man 2 still pissed on the finale in the first one. My only complaint about Iron Man is the lack of a decent final fight. That rooftop/street showdown was very anticlimactic, so I was looking forward to Jon Favreau upping the ante for the sequel. He definitely did, and it wreaks havoc on your sound system. Wow. Window shattering, neighbor waking stuff. Even though I said that the movie did not spend too much time pushing the Avengers into existence, it was still very there. Front and center, to be honest, but never overbearing, like it has been made out to be. There were a few nicely placed little easter eggs that very clearly winked at us fans of the Marvel Universe.

One golden nugget (or red, white, and blue, to be exact) actually made me laugh with excitement for what has now become my second favorite Marvel Studios production, after the first Iron Man. That would be Captain America: The First Avenger. Overall, the film was pretty funny. More humorous than anything else, but that's not to say that the action was not impressive. It was definitely good stuff, but this movie still didn't meet my expectations, as far as the hype that was built around it. It's surprising that this all-star cast could not elevate this sequel about its predecessor. I would rank it on the lower side of Marvel Studios' filmography, but still fairly high in comparison to your average comic book movies. My ranking thus far (pre-Avengers) is: (1) Iron Man, (2) Captain America: The First Avenger, (3) The Incredible Hulk (which really needs a sequel, by the way, whether it be with Ruffalo or Norton -- obviously Ruffalo), (4) Iron Man 2, and (5) Thor (don't let me ranking it last fool you, I really like it). Anyway, back to the film at hand. I probably loved this movie more than the average moviegoer, or film enthusiast, due to me being such a huge comic geek, and Marvel fan. But nevertheless, this is a good movie. If you were to separate it from the first film, it probably wouldn't hold up quite as well, but it would still be good. I've defended this movie from the claims that it's just an Avengers preview throughout this review, and I stand by that, but to be honest, had Favreau chosen not to put as many Avengers easter eggs and set-ups in it, it would probably stand on its own merit better. So to wrap this up, I liked it less than the original, but I still highly recommend it to fans of the Marvel U, or comic book flicks in general. If you're not into comic book films, I say rent it first.",1341792000,,6967,4.462745098039216

3840578,5,B0021L8V1Q,"I was weary about the sequel for Iron Man but it turned out to be a pretty decent sequel. Justin Theroux's script was well written and the visual effects were astounding. Stay after the credits for a lead in to another of the Marvel Universe movies.

The plot was decent. Tony Stark needs to find another element than palladium to keep him alive. The palladium in his chest piece that was keeping him alive and the shrapnel from entering his heart is slowing killing him. He hands over the company to Pepper Potts to run while he works on a way to cure his problem. He is also convinced his is going to die. Ivan Vanko, a Russian physicist previously imprisoned in Russia for selling Russian secrets, builds the Whiplash outfit to seek revenge against the Starks. Howard Stark, Tony's father, fired Ivan's father Anton and sent him back to Russia to live in exile and thus Ivan has a serious revenge issue with the Starks. Ivan goes after Tony at the Grand Prix in Monaco and destroys Tony's race car on the track and tries to kill him. Ivan is taken to prison for life in Monaco. At his birthday party, he gets drunk and destroys his house. Rhodey puts on the War Machine suit to counteract Iron Man into calming down, but they end up fighting each other and destroying Tony's house. Justin Hammer, Tony Stark's old friend and rival defense weapons dealer/manufacturer, breaks Vanko out of prison and enlists his help to build a drone army for the military with technology that rivals Iron Man's technology. Of course, the drone army is controlled by Vanko and thus goes after Iron Man. Iron Man has to team up with Rhodey's War Machine again to fight off the drones and Vanko. Natalie Rushman (aka Natalie Romanov and the Black Widow) is Pepper Potts' replacement and is under cover at Stark Industries. She evaluates Tony Stark's personality and behavior for S.H.I.E.LD. and recommends that he does not join them. Nick Fury appears and interviews Tony Stark for the Avengers Initiative. He gives Tony a copy of Natalie's report and recommends that he be a consultant only to S.H.I.E.L.D.

The visual effects were better than the first movie. I'm looking forward to Iron Man 3.",1338163200,,2179,4.671875
3840579,2,B0021L8V1Q,"Sequels are always tricky, and I was happy to see they didn't try to take the, bigger, louder, more boom direction that most do.  However, what happened to Tony?  Yes, he was a rich jerk in the first, but it was entertaining.  After his experience of being kidnapped and held hostage, he was interesting and you find yourself rooting for him, and he was still entertaining, they didn't change his personality, just changed the direction.

The second film, however, I mostly just wanted to punch him.  Everything good about Tony dissapeared in this movie.  I didn't like him, at all.  What in the movie did Tony do that was positive in any way?  So glad they got him back on track in the Avengers movie.  Worried about IM3...

Also, what was with the dialogue?  Every conversation in this film is the actors talking over each other, and without the subtitles on my DVD, I had no idea what anyone was saying, as it was all jumbled together.  And Hammer?  PUH-LEESE.  I get that he was supposed to be annoying and obnoxious, and... well he did it excellent, but why was that needed?  Every line he had was pointless.  Also, really?... With Stark out of the picture the only weapons developer left in the country was one who couldn't actually develop weapons?  Why would he even be IN the business if he was total fail?  We're capatilists people!  Why was there no competiton?

Now I've heard different reviews from friends about this movie such as: it's too loud, too much shooting and explosions, I've also heard that ""it was just alright"" --so naturally being an Iron Man fan I wanted to see Part 2.  In the beginning like another reviewer mentioned, I was kinda getting a bit annoyed with the whole quest for the Iron Man suit.  Then you went through a nervousness about Tony's erratic behavior because he thought he was dying due to the reactor in his chest (although I knew it wouldn't kill him because he was in Avengers) so then we move to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rouke's character) and I actually think he plays a great bad guy, so I liked his role in the movie.  Sam Rockwell, well, he's Sam Rockwell. The shooting, explosions wasn't too over the top for me so I don't agree with others about that point. .so I thought Iron Man 2 was pretty decent, but not as good as Iron Man.",1337817600,,1156,4.403755868544601
3840581,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Everyone has said Iron Man was a great superhero movie, and I'm wholeheartedly in their camp.  That said, don't let that keep you from watching Iron Man 2.  It's a good movie in its own right.  In Iron Man 2, the world knows that Tony Stark is Iron Man, yet it isn't satisfied.  The U.S. Government wants Stark to give them the technology to the Iron Man suit.  S.H.I.E.L.D. is keeping a close eye on Stark, and Stark Industries is facing new problems brought on by Tony's irresponsibility, culminating with a late-night party while wearing the Iron Man suit.  Stark is slowly being poisoned by the very arc reactor that is also keeping him alive.  How Stark deals with it is what makes this movie so interesting.

Robert Downey Jr. suits his role perfectly.  His Tony Stark is egotistical and narcissistic, but still has a playful sense of humor and a powerful desire to do good in the world.  These qualities don't often go together, but Downey brings them all to Stark in a believable way.  I'd pay to watch an entire movie of him sitting by himself--he's that good.

Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Pepper Potts, who's a dedicated, hard-working woman trying to manage both Tony and his company, but slowly being driven mad by the stress of it.

Don Cheadle steps into the role of Lt. Col. Rhodes, and it isn't one of Cheadle's best.  Terrence Howard played a perfect Rhodes in the first movie--dedicated to the military, but also to his friend Tony, forever putting up with his shenanigans--even standing at attention for three hours on Tony's aircraft.  In this movie, Cheadle just doesn't seem believable as a military man.  In the Congressional hearing, both the Senators and Stark just overpower him verbally, and there just isn't the same level of playful banter between Downey and Cheadle as there was between Downey and Howard.  (No ""Spring Break 1987"" jokes here.)

Overall, Iron Man 2 is very much worth watching.  It's just not as good as the first.",1337385600,,1968,4.718475073313783

i bought my copy when it first came out. at the time, i didn't have an ipad or separate device. so i never thought that i would redeem the digital copy. finally when i did, the code DIDN'T WORK! having never lent it out, it made me wonder if someone had stolen the code, or if the code had been compromise. Then i later found out, that the digital copy has an expiration date! which meant my copy of TRON's digital copy was gone as well! (why did i pay extra if i wasn't going to redeem it right away? its a good future reference in case i ever buy digital copies again!)

Unfortunately, I saw Iron Man and I thought it was a great movie. It had a great story, excellent action, fun dialogue, etc.  So it set a pretty high standard for the franchise. Iron Man 2? Was a dud for me.
The story follows Tony Stark, about six months after he confessed to being Iron Man (the end of Iron Man, the first movie). And he turns out to be a pretty arrogant cuss, thinking he's all that and a bag of chips. Enter the ""Bad Russian"" who is ready to take him on (for some hokey revenge issue about his dad). And of course there's a big final blow-out battle at the end.
Obviously, visually, the movie is great. The acting is great. Mickey Rourke did an excellent job.
But it gets a little hard to keep track of all the senseless and distracting subplots going on that do nothing really, for the story. The subplots they had going on in Iron Man, seem to have been dumped into the waste basket for the 2nd installment, which is confusing as all.
It's a shame really. They poured a ton of money into this movie, and yet all those visual effects and great acting skills, do not a good script and story make.

Robert Downey Jr's performance remains dead on but Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell come close to stealing the show.

But the inclusion of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow starts to slow this down with too many Easter Eggs and superfulous characters.  And the gimick of Tony Stark discovering a new element in his basement jumped out as bad science even by comic standards.  If they'd just called it a new alloy it would have been fine.  Oh well...

The second disk has some nice extras, the deleted opening is particularly good, I'm surprised they didn't use it.  And the feature on the use of Flushing Meadow Park and the 1964 World's Fairgrounds warmed my New Yorker's heart.  I'm glad I went with it over the bare bones version.

3840598,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Overall, I think I liked this film as much as the first film. I went into the film with lower expectations since most of the people I talked to said it was either as-good or not-as-good as part one, and was able to walk out of it feeling satisfied with the overall film. The humor was good, the action was fun, the graphics were impressive, and the acting was up to par.
The movie follows Tony Stark/Iron Man as he deals with politics, media, and personal dangers incurred by the public disclosure of his secret identity and also faces a new enemy: the deadly son of a deceased Russian engineer that helped create some of the Stark enterprise.
But concerning the actors, I was always disagreeable to the change of actors with Colonel Rhodes' character from Terrence Howard to Don Cheadle. It's not that I don't like Cheadle or think that he did a bad job, it's just that Howard fit into the character (and the suit) a lot better than did Cheadle. Cheadle's character seemed lost the entire film and too easily persuaded by both sides of conflict. He bounced back and forth to Stark's side and then back to the military side and then back to Stark and never really seemed to find his place. Even in the end he seemed conflicted on what ground he stood on.
I also felt that Scarlett Johansson's character was overly-hyped by the previews and media and that her character was pretty unnecessary to the film. They really did not need her. Her job was to keep an eye on Tony Stark, but she was hardly around anyways and didn't seem to be as important as they tried to make her in the film.
They also spent a lot of time in the movie building up a back-story for the new Avengers film. With all this prep and fine tuning for the Avengers via several other movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001C08RHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incredible-Hulk/dp/B001DHXT1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incredible Hulk</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thor/dp/B0034G4P8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America/dp/B005IZLPKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America</a>), the film better blow the audience away or it's going to be a very, very, VERY big let down for the viewers.
Other than that, I really enjoyed the film and felt that it deserved more applause than it was given. This is a very note-worthy sequel in my opinion.

I guess if I dropped a turd in a cute little box and sealed it up good that's enough for a 5 star review. Give me a break!

I really enjoyed the original Iron Man more the 2nd time around. I started the sequel but never finished it. I recently came back to it with a fresher perspective and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, the sequel pits Iron Man against 3 foes: a vengeful Russian named Ivan (Mickey Rourke), a rival battle-suit maker played by Sam Rockwell, and finally himself as the hardware in the middle of his chest supporting his body is going bad. The story was decent enough for the world that this film takes place in. The action scenes and special effects were well done. If I had a choice between Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard I'd take Howard only because I believe that his charisma matches up with Downey's.

This film was definitely not as good as the first film in the story department but the action was as good if not better. And I think the film set up next year's Avengers movie well. I wonder if the Hulk's going to be in that film?

3840618,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Oh, man, is Johansson smokin'.  Does she just get more impeccable as time goes on?

Wait, what am I talking about again...?

So, moving on, then.  Ahem.

Favreau's take on the Iron Man franchise is quickly becoming a bit like an encompassment of the industry's greatest success stories.

All wrapped up in one lucrative, intelligent, and supremely entertaining package, we have the irreplaceable Robert Downey Jr., still riding on what is arguably the greatest career rejuvenation ever accomplished in recent memory; the indelible Mickey Rourke, frontrunner for one the best performances of the last decade when he caught the industry's attention again with his role in ""The Wrestler""; we have the undefinable Sam Rockwell, an eccentricity of a man who has skillfully challenged himself to become an undoubted favorite among cult enthusiasts and mainstream critics alike;  and, of course, there is director Favreau himself, a charming actor/director who's talent had been overlooked for far too long before his superhero breakout hit.

For the life of me, I cannot think of a cast and crew more deserving of recognition than this fine group responsible for the new Iron Man pandemonium that still has us in its clutches.  It's all very inspiring and heartwarming to see them enjoy such success.

All of this isn't just for article fluff; I'm encouraging you to appreciate just how big of an impact this cast is having on the project.  Without the chemistry that Favreau and Downey, especially, exude seemingly at will for their supporters to feed off of, this film and, indeed, the series itself, would suffer a subpar fate.  Being brutally honest, the script is manic and lacks rhythm, and there's really no excuse for so many protagonists and antagonists to intertwine with one another so freely in a single film.  It's all enough for a more conservative crew to have made three films out of, all clad with their own plot, action sequences, and character progression.

Iron Man 2 is dense, and it's clearly a bit of a mess, in retrospect.  But you just cannot deny the charm of everyone it features, and their combined effort more than makes up for it.  With Favreau clearly over his head, he turns to Downey's veteran expertise and ability to turn films in his favor when things are going south.  As a result, this is the actor's film to own, and he's certainly up to the challenge.  When things get noisy, Downey's there to keep some clarity.  When things get dull, Downey dances on a dime to improvise a comic crowd pleaser that brings us all back in.  Iron Man owes its new success to Robert, and vice versa.  It's as impeccable a fit as there ever was one in cinema history.

Inevitably, it begs the question if other members of the cast are ready to uphold their own responsibilities in keeping this frantic, bucking bull of a film at bay.  The film visibly suffers when Downey's off the screen, certainly, but not as much as you'd expect.  This is, in no small part, due to Rourke and Rockwell, who's villainous duo give-and-take system serves as evidence that, yes, a comic book movie not named ""The Dark Knight"" can have more than one villain and still be respectable.  The two, in fact, do more than enough to nearly steal the show, but then reality sets back in as Downey returns to drop a dry one-liner that has us in stitches.

As far as pandemonium goes, Favreau does about as well as any director could to keep control of things.  I won't hide my concern for the inevitable sequel, should the team choose to one-up themselves in all the wrong places, but my faith benefits from Downey's ability to seemingly do just about everything right and, in turn, encourage others around him to do the same.",1324166400,,3713,4.769953051643192

Of course that hasn't stopped Justin Hammer, Tony Stark competiton and albiet less intelligent than Tony wants the secerts so he can be top weapon desinger for the U.S. At the same time Tony Stark has just opened up the Stark Expo a convention where Tony allows some  of the greatest companies and minds to one place and showcase what the future of technology and science have to offer the world.  Of course all those who witness the opening day are not so happy.
  In Russia a man watches over his dying father who knows the secert of the arc technology that Stark's father claimed to have created. With him dead he begins in earnest to create a weapon that will stop him for good.  With revenge on his mind he begins to create a weapon being powered by what looks very much like Tony's first minature arc reactor.
  Tony is also racing against the clock as his arc core is killing him slowly and without finding a reasonable replacement his time is short and fears its time the armor go to another to take on the mantle of Iron Man. With Nick Fury trying to get him to join something called the ""Avenger Program"" and his secert agent Wanda Maximoff acting as his personal assitant can Tony even trust those closest to him.
  Col. Roberts Tony best freind watches as he begins to breakdown and decides its time the miltary has the armor and steals the prototype so they can have it and just made Justin Hammer in charge or the program to make them a new suit a real ""Warmachine"" for the U.S.  What none  of them know is that Hammer has just freed the unknown Russian from a french prison after a failed attempt to kill Tony at Le mans and has him working on a plan to destroy Stark once and for all.

A terrific and entertaining sequel to the surprisingly well done 2008 Marvel film, Jon Feravue returns back as director. I like how this movie deals with conflict including great character development and good acting. The action sequences are even bigger this time around including a very satisfying race track sequence that is just mind-blowing. There's also psychological issues in the film on the main character's conflict about what he is dealing with even with his love for Pepper. I should say this is a very good sequel that sets up for ""Thor"" at the very end of this movie.

3840632,1,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man 2 had all the elements of a blockbuster movie. A strong cast, solid direction by Jon Faverau, and spectacular special effects. Unfortunately, the film is bogged down by a soulless poorly written script that's all over the place. One sequel into this franchise and Iron Man is looking rusty.

Iron Man 2 picks up where Iron man 1 left off. Six months after telling the world He's Iron Man, Tony Stark is now dying of the palladium in the arc reactor that is keeping him alive. On top of this, the U.S. government is trying to take the technology for the Iron man armor from him, and competitors like Justin Hammer are trying to replicate the armor.

But somewhere in Siberia...the son of a former Stark employee Anton Vanko, Ivan Vanko has the secret arc reactor recipe that powers the suit. As Stark confidently testifies to the congresss that he's the only person who has the technology, Vanko heads over to France with his powered whips and own version of the Stark's secret recipe for the arc reactor.

After the big display at the Stark Expo, a dying Stark keeps his secret as he heads to France decides to race his own car. This is where the wheels fall off the movie and it becomes a jumbled mess. It's clear this sequence is just conveniently there so Whiplash can wreck stuff and Iron man can beat him up. I rolled my eyes as Happy Hogan drives down the race track the wrong way to give Tony his red and silver Mark V suit to beat up Whiplash and deliver him to the French police.
After Tony returns from France, we get more tacked on plot points in his new secretary Nancy Rushman who beats him down in his boxing ring. As he banters with Pepper Potts more convoluted stories are started. Nick Fury shows up with a mystery regarding some element Howard Stark was working on. Ivan Vanko gets busted out of Jail by Justin Hammer. Hammer goes to get his ""burd"" as the plot meanders to the midpoint.

A few sequences later it's Tony's birthday, and a drunken Stark celebrates by putting on his Mark IV armor and blasting stuff. Realizing he's putting people in danger, Jim Rhodes (again coming out of nowhere) suits up in the Mark 2 suit to stop him. After a big rock-em-sock-em robot fistfight between the armored gladiators, and an repulsor blast explosion that shatters all the glass in Tony's house, Rhodes announces he's taking the suit and flies away. As this tacked on plot point moves the movie forward, Shawn tries to figure out how he learned how to fly an Iron man suit, accessed the pass codes between movies. He also tries to figure out how a suit with no repulsors has them.

As Rhodey delivers the Mark 2 suit to the government to be weaponized, Tony goes to get some donuts, Nick Fury drops by to put Tony under House arrest. In addition to giving him something to do while cleaning up all that broken glass, he's told to figure out the mystery of the element. Tony goes and watches home movies, breaks out a model of the old Stark Expo and begins to solve the mystery of the triangle.
Meanwhile Vanko and Hammer are putting together drones. But Vanko has an eleventh herb and spice he's not telling Hammer about.

Meanwhile at the Stark mansion, Tony wrecks his house finding out the secret of the Triangle. As he installs the new coconut flavored element into his arc reactor, his life is saved just in time to figure out what Ivan Vanko is up to with his eleventh herb and spice.

At the Hammer expo, Hammer does the Hammer dance as he reveals the drones and Jim Rhodes as War Machine. Vanko reveals the last part of his secret recipe. As Iron man enters in his shiny new Mark VI suit, he confronts Hammer and the drones start attacking.
From here, Nancy Rushman goes into action as the Black Widow, and takes out Hammer's guards to get to Vanko.

But Vanko is long gone and she has to hack the computer codes get control of the drones. All she does is get War Machine back under Rhodey's control. Well, he needs to help tony beat up some robots. After destroying all the drones, Here comes Vanko in his souped up Crimson Dynamo knock off armor. After a heavy metal beatdown, Tony and Rhodey fire repulsors at each other, Vanko is KO'd. Vanko knowing he's beaten decides to make himself and the drones blow up just in time for tony to save Pepper.
At the end of the movie, Tony gets a medal for beating up on the Hammer drones, credits roll and we see a hammer and Agent Colson telling Nick Fury he's found it. I'd like to find out what happened to the story in this movie. Somewhere around the fifteen minute mark it stopped making sense.

It's clear there's something missing in Iron Man 2; it doesn't have the heart or spirit of the first film, which had a light lively tone. By contrast this film feels artificial and manufactured. It's clear the studio executives and the toy companies meddled in the creative process for this film to sell as many T-shirts, action figures and whatever merchandise they could imagine. Instead of the plot flowing together organically like the first film, Iron man 2 is jam-packed with characters that serve no purpose and a jumbled plot that goes nowhere. Tony's armor gets an upgrade but the franchise needs a downgrade. This movie is too much like the jumbled storyline of a comic book and nothing like the linear pacing of a movie.

As a diehard Iron man fan I was deeply disappointed with this film. As a Movie fan I was disgusted. Usually the process of executive meddling that ruins a franchise starts with the third movie.

I can't fault the actors here, they were prevented from doing their best with the horrible script they were given. Robert Downey Jr. is solid here but is held down from greatness due to the bad script. Gwyneth Paltrow who was amazing as Pepper Potts last time is awkward here. She and Downey don't have the electric Cary Grant/ style chemistry they shared in the first movie. the Don Cheadle is wooden as Jim Rhodes. Terrence Howard had much better energy and charisma in the role. Cheadle has no chemistry with Robert Downey Jr, and is just flat in the role. Sam Rockwell is solid as Justin Hammer. I'm still trying to figure out what Scarlett Johansson's purpose was in playing the Black Widow. Her part was severely underwritten and underdeveloped. Samuel L. Jackson is passable as Nick Fury. But again, they give him nothing really serious to work with.

Director Jon Faverau does his best to maintain the integrity of the Iron Man Franchise. The shots are about the same, the sequences are consistent with the first film, but it's clear the film doesn't have the same energy. What was once a fun superhero action franchise looks like it's on the slow road downhill like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise after Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. All I know is you won't see me in line for Iron Man 3. If you're thinking about getting Iron Man 2 Pass on it. This franchise is getting rusty.",1316044800,5,6890,4.520866773675762

Both of the Iron Man films are enjoyable on all of these levels. The first one is my favorite, although it is difficult to state why that's the case, but this second film is quite enjoyable as well. I can assure you I'm looking forward to a third in the series; my only requirement is that Downey remain the lead in any further films as he adds something special to the role.",1311120000,,1139,4.454545454545454

About mid-point I was almost ready to stop the movie when I decided to give it a little more time to develop. I'm happy to report that it got better in the second half and became easier to finish.

As with any relatively new DVD, the quality of both the video and audio is very good; the problem is the story and the character were limping along at a marginal pace. It was difficult to relate to any of the characters and one became disinterested in what happened to them, especially in the first half; after that the action improves and the story becomes more interesting.

I definitely recommend watching this movie before you buy it, it may work better for you than it did for me but I'll probably not watch it again. There was a trailer which suggested a sequel; the jury is out on that one.",1310342400,,1048,4.261306532663316

""It's a cluttered mess"" and I believed them, but I didn't care because I loved the first film and was wearing my `Scarlett Johansson blinders'.  Truth be told, I was disappointed, but not for the reasons they listed.  First of all, the film is nowhere near as cluttered as it could have been.  It doesn't really throw away any notable characters like `Spider-Man 3' did (I will never forgive that film for teasing us with Venum only to barely use him).  It is nowhere near as cluttered as `X-Men 3' was.  Sure, there are a few faces thrown in the mix (War Machine is merely flirted with and Black Widow could have used more screen time) but overall, this film remains focused on the key characters, and it builds a noteworthy villain in Whiplash.  For me, the film's major fault lies in the fact that it felt rather uninspired.  Nothing really felt exciting and new and fresh and memorable.  The action sequences, while shiny explosive, felt uneventful in comparison to some of the more thought-out sequences in recent films.  The visual effects are very impressive, taking that whole `video game look' to another level with sequences that feel real, and yet those fight scenes just feel redundant.  The acting is fine; Robert Downey Jr. was born for this role, but he doesn't add any new layers to what he created in '08.  I wish Scarlett had more screen time, but whatever, she was hot as per usual and while she didn't do anything truly `interesting', she was, well, hot.  I still love Paltrow in this role, so more her please.  This isn't a total mess, in fact in parts it is very good...and Sam Rockwell chewed that scenery like his life depended on it and was, in a way, the best thing about this film.  I'll see the third installment (although the whole `new director' thing scares me a bit), but I won't walk in with the highest of hopes.",1304985600,,1999,4.575842696629214

In Iron Man 1, Downey plays Tony Stark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an ""Iron Man suit"", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool. Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 because of the great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars.

In Iron Man 2, Stark has now disclosed to the public that he is Iron Man and the fame has gone a bit to his head. The government wants his 'weapon', his board loses confidence in him, his friends become increasingly annoyed with his behaviour, and the magnet in his chest is poisoning him to death. Paltrow is back as his assistant, Pepper, but I don't like her character as much in this one; too harsh. and Downey of course is back as Tony Stark. But in this movie, Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as his military friend. I like Cheadle but much preferred Howard. Samuel Jackson is great as usual as is Mickey Rourke who plays the villain, but Scarlett Johanssen's character was boring and very unrealistic (yes, even for a super-hero movie).

I did enjoy the background about Stark's family and father, especially when he discovers a message left to him by his father which can save his life. And Robert Downey's character is even more enjoyable in this one ie wittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.

So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first. A good family movie though and funny.",1304553600,,2162,4.438287153652393

Samuel L Jackson is great as Nick Fury and I hope Scarlet Johanson is part of any further Marvel Comics movies. Her action scenes (although rare) were amazing. Also Gweneth Paltrow gives another great performance. Mickey Rourqe was great as Whiplash. A superb villian. Marvel Comics movies tend to be good if not great. Iron Man 2 keeps the greatness going.

3840665,3,B0021L8V1Q,"***1/2

As ""Iron Man 2"" opens, Tony Stark, the wunderkind head of Stark Industries, has just revealed to the world at large that it is indeed he lurking inside the metallic suit of the planet's latest crime-fighting superhero.  But such a public admission comes with a steep price.  For now the United States government wants him to register himself as a deadly weapon; a rival defense contractor (Sam Rockwell) is determined to beat Stark at his own game by creating his own army of iron-clad warriors; and an arch-nemesis (Mickey Rourke) from the former Soviet Union has suddenly appeared on the scene in his own superhero getup to destroy Stark in a mano-a-mano battle on the streets of Monaco.

As a piece of pure Saturday-matinee popcorn entertainment, ""Iron Man 2,"" directed by Jon Favreau, is, perhaps predictably, a notch or two below its dazzling 2008 predecessor.  However, the sequel still has enough quality elements - most of them holdovers from the first film - to recommend seeing it:  namely, Robert Downey Jr. as the wisecracking, hard-living but lovable boy genius, Stark; Gwyneth Paltrow as his endearing personal assistant, now CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts; and enough funny one-liners to take the edge off of some - though not all - of the script's numerous plot contrivances.  As with the previous film, Downey Jr. and Paltrow achieve a wonderful love/hate chemistry between them, and the cast has been expanded to include Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson (who had an uncredited role in the first one), and Kate Mara as well.

The screenplay by Justin Theroux makes at least one right choice by having Stark becoming ever more gravely ill as a result of the chemical he has to keep pumping into his chest to survive in his semi-cybernetic condition.  This has the effect of humanizing the character, making him destructible and vulnerable and, thus, someone whose fate we can come to care deeply about.  And, needless to say, Downey Jr.'s smart, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.

The special effects and actions scenes are impressive, of course, but it is Downey Jr. and Paltrow who once again make the movie soar.",1303344000,,2217,4.964864864864865

3840668,2,B0021L8V1Q,"""Iron Man 2"" could have been a great movie.  This is the frustrating fact of the mostly-failed effort of ""Iron Man 2.""  It is not a complete loss, but it is dying of a cancer, a malaise if you will.  It suffers from a malaise that is seeping all over Hollywood over any good franchise.  We all have seen this malaise, felt its effects and lamented its continued presence.  It has brought down titans and peons in the movie industry alike.  The problem is, it is insidious, tempting and truly the devil's fare.  It has gone by many names, but I dub it ""Sequalitis.""  Sequalitis infects any movie that has even the potential to become a franchise.  It has been there since day 1 and will be with us till the day we die since studio executives rate somewhere between dimwits and rutabegas on the intelligence meters. We have been warned since childhood with fables such as the golden goose to stay away, but studio executives must try to kill all that is good in the universe.  They are not responsible for innovation, but they sure can kill it.

Okay, so what is sequalitis, you may ask?  Simple.  It is the mistaken notion that the next installment of a successful movie must have everything the first one did and more.  It must be bigger, more thrills, more chills, more stars and more oomph.  The notion of trying to recreate a formula that worked so well, usually because it was so unique.  Once that uniqueness is attempted again, though, it is no longer unique and therefore loses its magic.  And we can place the blame squarely in the stupid studio executives' grubby little hands.  It is greed unboound.  It is the triumph of commerce over art.  It is...some other metaphor for Goliath beating David.  Movies cost SO much to make anymore, between special effects cost, marketing, talent and executive avarice, union rates and a whole host of other costs that go into the production of a high-profile movie.  Combine that with the slavish devotion to the pre-release focus group feedback and the studios all but strip out any kind of magic or originality into a production until we are left with a bland, flaccid and vanilla avatar of what could have once been something interesting and, yes, fun.

This is the problem with ""Iron Man 2.""

""Iron Man 2"" has approximately 6 good movies in it.  If the producers would have picked 2, they would have had a great movie.  I loved Stark's alcholism, losing his company, a rival nipping at his heels, his assistant taking over, his friend starting a new Iron Man, a wronged villain enacting revenge, a government agent spying on him, a new covert government agency working at cross purposes with him and ---gasp!--- the Avengers initiative.  All of these are interesting plotlines.  But because fanboys want to see War Machine or Black Widow or Whiplash or whatever, the producers tried to put in everything while doing justice to nothing.  It becomes a ham-handed attempt to make a tentpole movie delivered with all the subtlety and finesse of a sledgehammer to the side of the head.  Add to that a stupid, cartoon villain (the rival contractor), frenetic MTV-style editing that ensures you can't figure out what just happened, never mind what will happen, and a story-telling device that makes you think you dropped into a 10-episode show at the 3rd for 4th show.  The executives forgot what made the original ""Iron Man"" so good, which was about a very flawed man who has a life-changing experience and tries to make good on his past sins.  The iron suit is merely incidental.  The STORY is what is important here, not the trappings.  ""Iron Man"" is fantastic until the last 20 minutes when it becomes the battle of the iron men.  This sequalitis makes me cringe for what is in store with the upcoming ""Avengers"" movie next year.  When they throw all of these last 5 or 6 movies into the soup, I fear we will get a confused mess, not a worthy story-line.  Bottom-line, don't think too much about ""Iron Man 2.""  It is like a Victoria's Secret model.  It looks beautiful, but in the end is vapid and devoid of any depth or intelligence.  You want to look, you will have a good time.  You want anything deeper, stand in line just like everybody else and lament the ""pretty but dumbness"" of the movie.  It is all sound and thunder, but no rain.  Nothing substantial.  But really awesome to look at.",1302652800,,4342,4.62696335078534

3840670,4,B0021L8V1Q,"The sequel to Iron Man promised to be an entirely different movie because it took the standard trope - playboy superhero trying to lead a double life - and turned it on its ear by having Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity to the world. Iron Man is the Batman of the Marvel universe, so you can imagine the implications of a billionaire with an arsenal of firepower at his fingertips.  The government, for one, is extremely nervous about a private enterprise waging wars in foreign countries - a topical concern in today's world of ""security firms"" operating in America's wars. Shareholders, for another, fret that the often intoxicated Stark is such a warped genius that he will self-destruct ala Charlie Sheen.

Iron Man 2 is further complicated by aggrieved Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) codenamed Whiplash, who teams up with Steve Jobs-like Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a second stringer defense contractor.  To make matters worse, Stark's palladium core - the miniature reactor in his chest - is poisoning him.  The world has it out for Mr. Stark.

There are several plot points that Iron Man 2 struggles to juggle simultaneously: the leadership of Stark Industries, the government's demands for the Iron Man plans, Stark's romance with his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his past relationship with his deceased father (a genius in the Walt Disney mold who built his own World's Fair-like Stark Expo), his looming death, his battle with alcoholism, and his rivalry with a competitor (Hammer) and the son of the original developer of a similar suit (Vanko).  And oh yeah, there's a little matter of the Avengers trying Stark out for membership.

There's so much going on that inevitably some of these plot points suffer.  Stark's romance with Potts is more implied than acted, his alcoholism is played up for laughs, and both villains are poorly realized in comparison to the other people in Starks' orbit.  Rockwell, in particular, comes off as an incompetent boob incapable of actually leading a company much less rivaling Stark. Vanko, on the other hand, has such a dangerous presence that it's hard to believe he's both a brilliant scientist AND a bird-loving, whip-wielding thug.

When Iron Man does bust loose though, it rocks.  War Machine is a welcome sight, and the conflict between Stark and Vanko in the middle of the Circuit de Monaco is thrilling. The fight scenes are exciting, more akin to jet fighters in flight than human-sized tanks.

Iron Man 2 doesn't have the emotional heft of its predecessor - it's far too busy to worry about peoples' feelings - but it does pack a solid punch.",1301788800,,2666,4.966292134831461

I have a feeling that Scarlett had a significant role in this movie. As a sexy, unbeatable agent. Lol I had seen what Hollywood did to her moves, she didn't blink even once(script don't allow that because in Hollywood we are the heroes and we set the rules. And rules are:America as a world dominator, world saviour,world's best bla bla bla they have the sexiest women on earth with no American descent in real life, plastic surgery, lots of make up, even more added sexiness with special effects to already pretty women and they should know at least 9 languages, marshall arts,be special agents and they should in the end win over the bad guys easily, whatever, you name it). And her moves so ummm ''very realistic''. I swear when I saw her moves in the air and all that, I was looking for defects in the movie like a cable or cord around her waist that allowed her to move freely. I don't do that usually. It was the first time that I recall when I was laughing over all these things. And then she just had to train all her moves and repeat them until it goes flawlessly. And remember real American hero kicks ass and does not blink and it all shall be paced within 1 minute. LOL. What next? Downey is not one of my favorite characters. In the first Iron man he was a lot better. But in Iron Man 2 he is so arrogant and boring I was hoping for a bad guys to kick his ***. His relationship with his lover is looking cheap, similar to other movies, where if it worked in one movie, the other ten movies will destroy it by copying all the things that once made it fun to watch. And which we loved. This movie has money, special effects but no story whatsoever, plot is terrible. Some actors could have been better. If there should be Iron Man 3, I wish it to be something set in the far far future where it has nothing to do with Downey and previous suits or actors. Like as if it is another suit by design with other upgrades. And please no rubbish. Special effects put here and there and everywhere will not go well with a bad story and characters which some of us can't and don't want to see anymore. And for the last. It is very typical of Hollywood to show off Russians like that. And who was that actor who played Russian? Mickey Rourke. I didn't like nothing about what they've done. It's just a Hollywood standards. Directors get paid, people eat this rubbish and so they think they are the most supreme race in the world? Oh please.

3840691,2,B0021L8V1Q,"I felt that they slacked on the first Iron Man, slacked, but all in all it was very entertaining and quite enjoyable (Hey, at least it wasn't Spider Man 3)  Iron Man 2 however, it just sad.  Its really awful.  I'm going to try to break it down as simply as I can.

1- Tony Stark is played by an incredible actor.  Robert Downey Jr. is an example of how poor writers can just ruin a movie no matter who is in the cast.  Tony is supposed to be an arogant, witty, quick-tongued, cocky guy, but Iron Man 2 is just one lousy attempt at a one-liner.  Nothing made me laugh.  The script should be burned, buried, and forgotten.  Stark was never meant to sound like a washed up, smart @$$ stand-up wannabe.

2- The title should have been The Avengers feat. Iron Man.  I truly want to see something develop out of all this Avengers hype, but my lord.  The world is in perile, Tony's body is poisoning itself to death, but every 3 seconds Nick Fury comes running up with a contract ""Tony please sign here, sign here!""  Just too much of it in this movie.

3- Plot needs to get original now.  Just as in Iron Man 1, Tony is having some kind of grave problem with his technology, he is trying to create some magical solution, someone has stolen his technology, found a weakness and is now using it against him.  Exact same plot basically across both movies.  For half this movie Tony is in his lab trying to create a new element! Not fighting crime, but getting drunk and making elements...

4- Speaking of the drunk.  The scene where Stark and James Rhodes (War Machine) fight it out in Tony's house while Tony is drunk and just completely destroying what little shred of respect I had left for this movie, stops everything dead.  The scene is horrible, the music is atrocious, I could have lived without it.  At least War Machine was around though, somebody had to do work.

5- This is one of the biggest let downs I had with the movie, minor and stupid yes but a let down.  Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is working to create an army of ""Iron Men"".  At the beginning of the movie he is seen with a cockatiel bird on his shoulder.  When asked by his partners if he needs anything to help him work Ivan replies that he wants his ""bird"".  They get him a bird and he is EXTREMELY upset that it wasn't his actual, personal bird.  I thought AHHH the bird remembers all the Stark Technology plans and he needs it to finish his work! Genius!  Nope, not the case...he just wants his bird. Was there nothing better to anger Whiplash with?! Is he going around slappin race cars left and right because he lost his bird?! Get real...I would have died a happier man had that been left out.

On the upside (if there is one), Iron Man 2 is visually stunning!  If you would like to see IMO a movie that has set a new standard for effects and filming this is it.  A baboon could have directed a better movie, but at least they made garbage look incredible.  You also have Rourke who plays a great villian.  I'm really pleased with his role.  Some people say he doesn't have enough lines but I think that is what adds to his character so much.  Awesome job, two thumbs up!  You get to see some of Black Widow too, at least someone was a good superhero.

I wouldn't waste my money. Netflix, rent, whatever.  Don't buy.  I know a few people who liked the movie, but I honestly think they just hadn't been watching movies lately and wanted to see something.  Maybe little kids would think this was soooo awesome, I just can't see the good in it.",1298419200,,3502,4.295107033639144

Based on the Marvel Comics and starring his friend Robert Downey Junior, Iron Man 1 and 2 were box office successes and rated well with critics.  This 2nd installation takes of where the first one ended, and employs the same comedy, sarcasm, action style, and main characters as the first one, though with different villians of course.  And in this movie, the romance between Iron Man and his secretary / assistant leads to their first kiss.

I know now why Jon Favreu is not coming back for the 3rd movie.  In the documentaries he looks tired and not very happy with the studio giving him so little time to finish the movie, hense a lot of changes were made.

Almost every character was some self-absorbed ego maniac. Narcissistic Hollywood enjoys creating high-society synthetic crappy art which reflects itself. Sooooooo boring.

Iron Man 2 had some of this but I liked the way they did the story plot and it was a good fight at the end that was more plausible than most earlier super hero ones.

3840730,4,B0021L8V1Q,"With this review of Iron Man 2, I have seen the film twice in theaters.

The sequel is following in the steps of recent blockbuster sequels in that it has so many storylines to follow. (even though the director mentioned they wanted to keep things simple)

While not as complex as Batman Begins, Iron Man 2 is full of new characters and actions scenes. The additional action scenes are a warm welcome to the lack from the first film while some of the new characters were a painful need.

Robert Downey Jr returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man. With fame all around, Stark must deal with his mortality as the power source in his chest is slowly poisoning him to death.

Don Cheadle fills in as Col. Rhodes. I like this actor switch. Cheadle brings a weight that ""that other guy"" missed. In this film, we get to see War Machine in his full glory: guns blazing and heavy duty explosions.

Scarlett Johansson star as Black Widow even though they never use this name in the film. She is part of SHIELD and is tasked with keeping an eye on Stark. She has a dizzying fight scene near the end of the film.

In fact, if the entire movie had the thrill of the last few minutes, this movie would be truly epic.

Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts and is given the job as Stark Industry CEO. The quick banter between Potts and Stark returns but their chemistry is on the short side (once again victim of too many new characters)

Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's main business rival. I suppose you could call him a villain but he just wanted to be the country's main source of weapons. I think there was too much Rockwell in this movie...too much not-funny Rockwell.

Mickey Rourke is the main villain in Iron Man 2. He's on a vengeance kick against Stark because of some bad family blood with their respected fathers. I still don't get why this guy is seen as such a good actor.

Samuel L Jackson returns as Nick Fury. At this point every character is Jackson regardless of the character's name. Supposedly Jackson got the studio to contract him into 9 films in order to be in this film. Ego much?

Iron Man 2 doesn't quick live up to the hype but it was some big hype. The final battle scenes make the entire movie. It seems as if Jon Favreau took the criticism from the first movie (poor final battle) and upped the octane.",1294099200,,2311,4.401408450704225

I was wrong; I thought Iron Man 2 was better, a more likable and entertaining film than the first! Of course, it helps to know in advance that the ""hero"" (""Ton Stark,"" played by Robert Downey) is even more obnoxious in this film. Knowing that, I didn't let that bother me and just enjoyed the good acting in here and the excellent special-effects.

Mickey Rourke (""Ivan Vanko"") is almost always interesting to watch so I enjoyed his role, too, even if I had a hard time understanding his Russian accent.

The story is, yes, sophomoric but most action films today are.

While I certainly appreciate her addition, I did feel like the Avengers sub-plot stuff got in the way of the movie and ultimately detracted from the story. An example of real life concerns negatively influencing the art it creates. Mickey Rourke is largely wasted here and much of the movie sort of just drifted from scene to scene. For the most part, I agree with a lot of the reviewers here that said Robert Downey Jr. is the only reason this movie succeeds to even the degree it did and that the rest of the movie was not nearly on par with either it's predecessor or other superhero movies.

I got the Blu-Ray combo pack so I did like that it was very easy to stick this on my IPod and the picture is beautiful, but unfortunately, the movie itself could have been a lot better.

3840760,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Almost always sequels, especially action-packed sequels, suffer by comparison with the first production. That is the case here with Iron Man 2. What made the original Iron Man interesting, beyond the finely-tuned performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the ""frat brat"", poor little rich boy, Tony Stark, out to find his place in the world, and incidentally act as the sole defensive shield necessary to save the old U.S.A., was the creation of Iron Man and that first struggle against the world's evil metal. IM2 already figured to extend that monster metal notion, although harking back to the old Cold War days with a Russian antagonist (Mickey Rourke, as Ivan Vanko) out to revenge old hurts was a curious twist. Iron Man, naturally, despite a few aging ""heart"" problems single-handedly (oops, double-handedly, he has a partner here). The plot left me with this feeling-Ya okay, what of it.

As for the boy meets girl aspect (Downey and his administrative assistant, Paltrow), or I should say ""boy met girl"" since they already got kind of moony-eyed in the first picture, an aspect that is always sexually and romantically understated in these comic book-drawn movies (Spider Man, Super Man, etc.) they continue that chaste romance here. What I don't get is why a sensible woman like Downey's ""Girl Friday"" would have anything to do with a, well yes, a good-looking guy with a zillion dollars, with some ""boss"" fast cars, and with access to all kinds of techno-gadgets. A no-brainer, right?  At least, serious, chaste, ""kick butt"" governmental agent Scarlett Johansson didn't fall for all that superficial stuff.

However one viewing in the theatre of this movie was enough for me and as well our son.

Samuel L Jackson, whom I love, was actually annoying as Nick Fury, not this fault though, really the writers fault for putting him in scenes when the movie didn't warrant it. Don Cheadle was OK but I missed Terrence Howard's charm. Sam Rockwell as Hammer was good though, and Mickey Rourke as Whiplash seemed terrific if only they had used him more! Paltrow and Downey were good but the movie was really slow moving and the fight scenes pretty sparse. Overall a big disappointment.",1292025600,3,832,4.705479452054795

The story picks up right where we left off, but immediately introduces us to one bad Russian dude who can seriously challenge Iron Man with the same technology he created in the first movie.  Tony's arrogance is expanded and the new characters who want to see Iron Man fail and who want the technology for their own benefit are perfectly cast.  Seeing the ""good guy"" played with a twisted personality could only have be done by Robert Downey, Jr.  It was a totally enjoyable movie that I quickly added to my DVD library.",1291593600,,678,4.616666666666666

Rather it is supposed to be enjoyed and the best way to do it is to sit back and watch the movie with a big bowl of popcorn because movies like this one are perfect for that.

The story is simply a continuation of the previous one. All of the performances are near to perfect and are very enjoyable. Micky Rourke does stand out and is always at his best when playing slimy greaseballs.  I was glad to see Nick Fury given a larger role in this movie which was enjoyable.

I gave it so many chances and it never got better.  I would have given it less than one star, but I'll give it one purely for Mickey Rourke's performance.  Sadly, not even Mickey could save this piece of cinematic junk.  Yes, there are cool special effects but there aren't enough special effects in the world to make up for Iron Man 2's total lack of story and plot.  Downey's performance as the arrogant genius is so over the top it's boring and the chemistry between he and Paltrow is non-existent.  In fact she doesn't seem to have much of a reason to be in this film at all. She's like a potted plant in the background of each scene she's in.  In order to make up for the poor script and mediocre acting, the film is packed full of so many baffling characters that we don't get a chance to understand them or care about any of them...Including the main character, Tony Stark.  In the first movie we could at least care about him even with his flaws.  In IM2 we have Stark's arrogance shoved down our throats so much that I found myself rooting for the bad guys to do something to make him shut up.

The gadgets and holograms just take my breath away.  That is how I wish technology was nowadays with touch screen holographic monitors and holographic touch fields of stuff.  But anyways, back to the movie.  I rate it 3 stars because it was more graphic than the first one, and most of the stuff is just a re-run.

I, & many others, didn't go to the theater to see this. We didn't buy the DVD, either. I only rented this for 99 cents. How much of that are they going to get? Not going far on that, weasels. What did they do? They retained most of their stolen money, & went w/Skellboy... What's his name, Rooney? The guy is a skell. I'm sorry. He did an OK job w/The Wrestler. He's not a real actor, though. He's a skell. That hardly makes up for it. Back to Terence's end. I like Don. This was Terence's role, though. His absence showed.

Some people bashed this film. @the end of the day? It aint rocket science. It's Iron Man. It was a good, entertaining plot. The Hughes' hearings were a nice touch. Skydiving is always cool. The Monaco GP, & final fight was kick_A*s. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I let the studio make money off it? No. They got what, fifty cents off my rental? That's a bit less than $20+ @the theater, or $18 for a DVD. Most of what they slap together nowadays is Caca, anyway. I rarely go to the theaters anymore. Oh Yeah, last thing. I watched the trailer. It shows Pepper kissing Tony's (removed) helmet, & then pitching it out the open jump door. That scene was deleted during the editing process. You think maybe you want to only use finished footage in your trailer??? I guess they saved some money on the trailer, too. Good. The money is drying up, fatties. Most of what you make is garbage.

It is a shame when a film (Iron Man) whose success was uncertain and which was a gamble, but which turned out to be very profitable can be a curse. Everyone involved wants to repeat the success, especially the financial return, but at what cost?

I will always be glad we got the first film, which I feel is a classic. I just hope things don't get worse with Iron Man 3 - a lot of us know how sequel quality seems to go downhill, yet we still support them and make up the audience for them - strange, isn't it?",1290729600,,688,4.134328358208955

The fight scenes were predictable and didn't like Cheadle playing his own Iron Man's sidekick.
Overall the movie does have some good action scenes but parts are boring too.
Paltrow was better in this than in Iron Man 2, and Scarlett Johansson was more or less eye candy. The real winner in this film is the great soundtrack. Great surround sound and the race scene was spectacular. Primarily for this reason I would want to own this movie. But not for $20 or so.",1290124800,,679,4.528455284552845

You may also download your own digital copy onto your PC and take the movie with you when you travel. I'm from Manila, Philippines. The version that they're selling here comes only in 2 discs and is even more expensive.

3840796,3,B0021L8V1Q,"I just actually watched the first Iron Man for the first time this year, mainly because i thought the second one actually looked pretty good. I just really didn't even pay attention when the first was released because comic book films just really aren't my thing. The first was good, not stellar, but great effects a decent story, the very cocky Tony Stark whom you can't help but like, and good action. The second film starts out rather slowly, with a few action sequences here and there, and Mickey Rourke playing the bad man as usual. Rourke is fantastic in most films i've seen him in, this one is an exception as he has little to no dialogue because he is Russian. I wanted to see him a bit more verbal, and also doing more than just working on robots.

Don Cheadle is a nice addition this time around, and definitely a better actor than the previous guy. Where the films falls flat is its pace, its very back and forth with moments of boredom and other moments where you sit up and take notice. The funny moments really aren't funny, and the sarcasm really isn't nearly as good as in the first film. Stark's cockiness really gets pretty annoying in the beginning of the film, but then takes a back seat for an apparent reason about half way through the film. As far as a story, well there's were it hits rock bottom, there is none. There is only one new revelation to be revealed in the film to make you go ohhh ok cool, thats about it. Other than that its just the basic good guy against bad guy, good guy thinks bad guy is dead, he's not, then back for one last round. That being said the biggest part of the action is only in the last 33 minutes or so of the film, and its just not really that interesting.

The last battle sequence was also very short and disappointing as well, leaving you wanting more. Most films go over the top with it's drawn out endings but i thought this film needed it after an hour and a half of mediocrity. So this was a semi-blockbuster, but not nearly as much as the first, not to keep bring up that point but it was a lot more original. I also watched The Incredible Hulk(2008) and thought it was about 10 times better than this film. Also at the end of it Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) makes an appearance at the end making it like he will take care of the Incredible Hulk(problem) right at the end of the film. I've seen nothing in the works, but that would be quite a match-up, or a good nemesis. So lets hope there is not an Iron Man 3, but perhaps a vs type deal in the future. While the acting is good and its got all the elements to be a good film the Iron Man suit feels a little rusty this time around. As i said, good but lacking.

Also on one last note, why they do this i have no clue. Many films today show parts in previews that are NOT in the film. The part of the preview where Gweneth Paltrow is talking to R.D Jr., she gets annoyed and throws his helmet out of the plane, he says ""you complete me"" then jumps out. Its not in the film at all, at least not the one i watched. Strange.",1289865600,,3035,4.184615384615385

3840798,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Ever since I got the playstation 3 I have not bought a DVD if I could help it. Why collect the old format if a new one is available. Of course Blu-Ray does not always live up to expectations. The presentation of Iron Man 2 is good, and the package has all your could ask for: Deleted Scenes, extra content, background info on the characters, and the movie looks and sounds great. The set also features a DVD copy for use when a Blu-Ray is not available.

As for the movie, it's good but it's not great. I am a fan of superheroes, especially Marvel's characters. I'm not sure these movies are doing them justice. For examlee there's an annoying habit they have of taking the characters out of costume. Iron Man, needs to have his armor on to be Iron Man. If he is in armor he should not be constatnly opening his visor. The action is good but there is not as much as one would hope. And must all Superhero movies include an origin of some sort (the villian Whiplash in this case)?

On the plus side the actors do a great job. Sometimes Tony Stark is a bit too smarmy to be likeable but that's the scripts fault. The actors are good and they do a great job of humanizing their characters, which is the most importatnt part in movie of this type: we have to empathize with the people to believe anything that is going on.

Iron Man 2 continues in the standard set by Iron Man 2--fast pace action and heroic adventure.  A non-thinking, arm chair movie were you just sit back and enjoy.  If you are a Iron Man/Marvel comic fan, you will find little not to like about the second installment of the man of iron.

3840805,2,B0021L8V1Q,"You can't fault Iron Man 2 for not being pretty. The movie looks awesome if you can stay awake for the whole thing. Amazingly there is almost no action throughout but if I focus on that I'll just be repeating what a hundred other reviews have already said. My bigger problem is with the main plot. The movie opens with Tony Stark MC'ing `Stark Expo' and basically coming off like a rich arrogant jerk. We then cut to Ivan Vanko, a heavily scarred and tattooed Russian living in poverty who sets off to build his own super suit to take revenge on Tony Stark for um.... well, something that supposedly Stark's dad did to his dad but I don't remember it ever being spelled out. So the entire motivation of Vanko is left undefined. The contrast between Stark in his absurdly futuristic lab and the brutal but brilliant Vanko in his dingy, dark apartment with equipment piled high seemed like it was taking its cues from Rocky III. In the third Rocky movie Rocky was living the high life as champion of the world while the much hungrier Clubber Lang trained with everything he had in a filthy, rat infested gym. Lang handed Rocky a crushing defeat because he fought and trained with more heart and Rocky only regained his belt by humbling himself and returning to his roots. By contrast Tony Stark defeats Vanko twice fairly handily and the Champaign never stops flowing. So who is the hero and who is the villain? Vanko's only motivation was nebulous revenge on Stark and his defeat was crushing and humiliating against the endless resources of the pompous Stark. In the final fight Iron Man and War Machine are surrounded by dozens of Vanko's drones only have Stark whip out a laser slicing them all in half without hardly breaking a sweat. I know Iron Man is supposed to be the hero with flaws but good lord is it hard to root for him.

Early in the movie Tony Stark is called before a Senate committee led by Senator Stern (Garry Shandling). The Senator is concerned that a private citizen has such a powerful weapon and demands it be turned over to the government. His other concern is that other countries are trying to duplicate the technology. Stark gives the Senate the finger and given the ratings of the current U.S. Senate I can imagine people enjoying this scene but the truth is that Stern is right. Whether he designed the weapon or not is irrelevant this is incredibly dangerous technology and when you get right down to it Stark has been shown to be very irresponsible such as in the scene later where a drunken Iron Man starts shooting wine bottle and watermelons thrown by models. After defeating Vanko, Stern has no choice but to award Stark a medal and the rich guy with the Iron Man suit wins again.

Since Vanko is clearly an overmatched opponent the writers gave Stark another issue to deal with. The arc reactor in his chest is poisoning his blood but you'd never know it since he seems fit as a fiddle even as the toxicity level exceeds 50%. So what he needs is a new element to replace the palladium core and leave the reactor safe. Guess what, his father discovered the element... and hid it... because... wait, hold on a second. How did his father know he was going to need an element since the shrapnel in his chest occurred long after his dad died and if his dad discovered this wonder element why did he hide it in this absurdly complicated hiding place? It makes absolutely no sense other then to look COOL onscreen as Stark uses his super technology to decode the secret. Having a NEW more powerful core Stark is in an even better place then at the start of the movie and everything is coming up roses. So we have a detestable character who wins in every possible way and learns nothing.

The movie looks fantastic and with Robert Downey, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell not to mention Samual L. Jackson and Garry Shandling the acting is great. High marks to Rourke in particular and it's a shame the poor Vanko was so dominated. I didn't mention Don Cheadel because he seemed to be sleepwalking through this role and Gwyneth Paltrow was a bit too shrill for my taste. The only real problem with the film is the plot but it's a killer. I used to think Superman Returns was the slowest big budget superhero movie but that one is action packed next to Iron Man 2. The racetrack scene with Vanko half an hour in is the best scene in the movie and from then on it just plods along. This one is DEFINETLY a rental. Some action movies I just skip to the action scenes to watch an abbreviated version of the movie but if you do that with Iron Man 2 you're lucky to be left with 10 minutes of movie. I can't imagine wanting to watch this one again.",1289347200,,4668,4.4637002341920375

3840854,4,B0021L8V1Q,"What makes the Iron Man movies great is that it all looks so real and Director Jon Favreau does an excellent job making it all believable too. And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an ""iron"" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but can fly.

And who better to be in the role of the eccentric, wise-guy Tony Stark than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark in Iron Man 1 and he hits it on the head again in 2! The rest of the cast, including Mickey Rourke, and acting in the movie were terrific. Rourke has about 3 lines in the movie, but that's all he needed. His character was well played and effective. And kudos to Sam Rockwell for an equally effective Justin Hammer portrayal.

Iron Man 2 picks up where 1 left off and has Rourke as Ivan Vanko out to avenge is father for a slight by Stark Industries. And Justin Hammer is just the man to help Ivan exact his revenge. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing once again has the viewer clamoring more Jon Favreau's in Marvel's series of Avengers related films over the next several years...I can't wait.

Iron Man 2 lost a little of the original shine that 1 had, but it's still an excellent movie. Worthy of collection and at minimum a Netflix must.",1288742400,,1326,4.274900398406374
3840855,3,B0021L8V1Q,"So it is official Tony Stark is Iron Man and he has been given quite a task. What kind of a hero is he going to be and will he destroy himself in the process.

This movie of course is only a small portion of what is on the way and now it is no longer a secret. In this movie Iron Man is being taken on by villains and heroes alike. There is a new villain out there who apparently had some connections with Tony's dad wants revenge. Because of his extra fame as an industrialist and a super-hero Nick Fury is trying to make sure that he doesn't get out of control even if it means taking him off the roster of the Avengers.

I really can't figure out how to put this review together because that is pretty much what the movie was like. It was a great deal of fun, but it was very much reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock. Just throw your characters to the canvas and hopefully a story will pop out of it. Well thankfully the humor and the great action sequences were able to keep the crowd interested and the movie did make quite a large amount in the box office. Still, in my opinion Marvel has to keep their heads on strait and stick to the plan ahead. There is a monster movie franchise brewing here and if they keep putting together movies like Iron Man 2 people will get very skeptical about the future projects.",1288742400,,1313,4.145098039215687

3840857,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Having really enjoyed the first Iron Man film, I was really looking forward to seeing this follow-up. Knowing that Chaplin's Robert Downey Junior was once again assigned to the lead role, I was reassured that this would not be another of those sequels that merely trades off the success of its predecessor (see Police Academy). The film didn't disappoint. It was more of the same, both in quality and tone, which is what I wanted, and I suppose most other Iron Man fans wanted.

The story follows up from the original film, but is heavily influenced by Robocop and its sequels, with humour undercutting the drama in many places. It isn't so comedic that the serious part is undermined, but there are quite a few broad comedy moments. The character of Tony Stark disturbs a little in places, his self-destructive nature in terms of his business, his environment, and his health are all darker features of the character that elsewhere exhibits great optimism and positivity. Downey Junior brings this complex character to life - so that when he is out partying, you can see in his eyes the darker undertones of his personality. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, although a reset switch appears to have been hit, and the closeness they achieved towards the end of the first film is forgotten about and she is just his assistant, rather than nearly his wife. The relationship follows pretty much the same path this film, although she has a rival in the form of a sexy spy Scarlett Johansson, and an all star cast is completed with appearances from a very dirty looking Mickey Rourke as a Russian physicist with a grudge against Tony and Samuel Jackson as a spy pretty similar to the role he played in the Matrix.

Don Cheadle is great as his friend, Rhodey, but he's a recast from Terrence Howard in the first film. Don makes a very good job of this and by the end, you forget that he's not the same actor, and Marvel Comics boss Stan Lee's cameo as Larry King has to be seen to be believed! Gary Shandling puts in a semi-comic performance as a senator, who is there to needle Stark, and threaten to take away his Iron Man suit. Shandling is just right for the role, looking now rather like a grinning Jimmy Carter/Kennedy type politician.

Overall, the look of this on blu-ray is excellent, and you can see how well the sets and effects have been made, although it's a shame that the extras are very pedestrian, and it feels like little effort has been made with these. Clearly they are holding something back for the two disc edition, but this feels a bit mean, and makes disc collectors like me want to wait for ""ultimate edition""s before buying. This doesn't detract from the film though, which is heartily recommended to anyone who liked the original film.",1288742400,,2764,4.6482617586912065

3840861,2,B0021L8V1Q,"Not being a comic book reader I have little background on the Iron Man franchise other than watching the original movie after hearing rave reviews from many of my friends. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Iron Man movie and it had a good combination of action, humor, wit and a good chemistry between the actors. After watching the sequel, Iron Man 2, I'm sad to say that the careful balance of the first movie has been eroded in favor of an over-the-top experience.

The basic plot pits the son (Mickey Rourke), Ivan Vanko, of a Russian physicist who assisted Tony Stark's father in building the Arc Reactor (used to power the Iron Man suit) against Tony Stark. At it's core, Iron Man is a basic revenge story. Though oddly the movie spends little time exploring and building that aspect of the story. In a few short scenes Ivan manages to build a fully functional arc reactor and sets on his quest to kill Stark. Iron Man 2 goes on to start so many concurrent plot lines that it's difficult to follow. There's the budding love story between Stark and his assistant turned company CEO, Pepper Potts (played by Gweneth Paltrow); the surprising arrival of Samuel Jackson playing Nick Fury in a clear set up of a future Avengers movie; political pressures by the US Government to take the Iron Man suit, the ascension of Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. Rhodes who becomes War Machine; and many other subplots that go almost nowhere.

From the beginning I couldn't shake the feeling that Iron Man 2 was a quickly conceived cash in on the popularity of the first movie. All the action sequences are are spectacular but completely over the top. The intro to the movie for example has Iron Man jumping out of a military C-5 (why when he can simply fly under his own power?) onto a stage of choreographed dancers. The first movie featured a careful build up to a spectacular finale against one other robotic suit. Iron Man 2 throws an entire army of robotic combat suits against Iron Man... and then one more fight against Ivan. Tony Stark's battle against alcoholism is reduced to an ill conceived source for comic relief as in one scene Stark is drunk and using his suit for skeet shooting indoors. It's disappointing that the darker side of Iron Man wasn't explored and instead used for laughs.

Iron Man 2 isn't without some entertainment value and it's certainly a better sequel than both Spiderman 2 & 3 in my humble opinion. Though I hope that any future Iron Movie undergoes a major overhaul similar to how the Batman movies were reset.",1288656000,,2527,4.6236080178173715

3840880,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I won't spend too much time on the film, as most of you who are thinking of buying this blu-ray have already seen it, but here goes; The original Iron Man was a very fun ride thanks mainly to the absolutely perfect casting of Robert Downey Jr., as he essentially IS/WAS the bad boy that Tony Stark IS/WAS.  The script was fun, the effects were awesome, and while a bit by the numbers the movie had the huge benefit of the fact that Iron Man was (at the time) essentially a ""B List"" character in the Marvel Universe and no one really expected much out of the movie.  Now Iron Man 2 has the unenviable job of following up on the momentum started in part one, but for the most part pulls it off rather well.  Mickey Rourke spouts ominous lines about blood and sharks and what-not that could come off as silly except he's actually making a very true point that once you show that God (or in this case Iron Man) is mortal and can in fact be hurt people will no longer worship him.  Rourke delivers a fun performance with the only gripe being that I wish he was a little more fleshed out, as he really does have a reason to hate Tony Stark and the character could have been a little less one dimensional.  This is a script fault though, nothing to do with Rourke, as he makes the character work.  Sam Jackson is at times a bit too Pulp Fiction-ish in his delivery but for the most part is an awesome Nick Fury.  Paltrow delivers her usual good performance despite having to once again be the damsel in distress, and Scarlett J. is a wonderful Black Widow (who's true super power seems to be gorgeous self curling hair in battle scenes?).  Downey is Downey, he IS Tony Stark, and minus a couple times of going a bit overkill he is awesome.  A good movie, lots of Avengers set up, with an ending that's a bit rushed but overall ok.
  Now to the actual blu-ray.  AWESOME!!  Tons of content, a director's commentary that's actually fun AND informative, and tight packaging.  As an added plus, the digital copy that every blockbuster has to have so they can add a ""3 DISCS!"" to the cover also contains a DVD copy of the film, a concept a truly wish all studios would adapt.  On the bonus disc you get hours worth of featurettes, some interesting deleted scenes, an AC/DC Shoot to Thrill music video, all three of the films trailers (why are some studios NOT putting the film's trailers on their own blu-ray's now???) as well as some other Marvel Trailers, etc.  Overall a very good package, highly recommended.",1288483200,,2499,4.388286334056399

3840882,1,B0021L8V1Q,"What a waste of money.  I bought this for my son, an Iron Man fan.  We both expected far more than was delivered.  This movie disappoints on many levels.  Very little action, the acting is so-so, and if all the CGI was cut out, there would be no movie at all.  It starts out by giving you a little hope that it will be more action-packed than the first one (which was a total dud) with a car race.  But that ends in an eye-blink and the remaining 95% is non-action, until the final show down.  In between these two events is Robert Downey Jr. talking.  That about sums it up.  I will not buy another Iron Man movie until it's done by different producers, directors, scriptwriters, screenwriters, and actors.

This one is also a TOTAL DUD.

3840923,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Ironman 2 is a great sequel to the original 2008 film. Rarely do sequel's equal or even come close to being as successful as their predecesor, but in this case Ironman 2 lived up to the hype. The introduction of new characters was well done, too. The sequel is basically set around the idea that Tony Stark's Ironman suit is slowly killing him due to the elements that comprise it. Robert Downey Jr's character, Tony Stark is in a fight against time to try and find a replacement element, which initially doesn't exist. The backdrop to this is that Mickey Rourke's character, Ivan Vanko, a Russian physicist has developed his own suit of destruction. The goverment is also after Tony wanting him to hand over the Ironman suit. Gary Shandling plays Sen. Stern who is leading the investigation into trying to claim the suit.
  I haven't see Gary Shandling in a movie or on TV in a very long time, and I can say I didn't miss him. The guy has spent too much time and money on botox or some other facial surgery because he actually looks plastic. Very scary, his face alone could have been a villian.
  It was nice seeing John Favreau gave Gwyneth Paltrow's characer, Pepper Potts a lot more freedom in this film as well. Her character is given the keys to the Stark Industries kingdom by Tony himself, temporarily of course. It was also nice to see the director in more scenes that involved dialogue, John Favreau was a great actor before becoming a great director. Other actors who include Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell and Samual Jackson round out this great cast of quality actors.
  I enjoyed seeing Scarlett Johansson in a tight body suit as the very hot, and very sexy spy, Black Widow aka, Natalie Rushman. She is a great actress and really brought a lot to the movie, besides playing a spy who works for Samual Jackson's character, Nick Fury, she handled the action/fight scenes with ease. I'm sure the lovely Scarlett spent many hours at a gym working on kung fu/karate moves for the part.
  The only real gripe I had were two separate issues. The first being the lack of fight scenes with Rourke's character. Robert Donwey Jr. and Mickey Rourke only share the screen for a small amount of time. The race car scene with Tony was good, as he was inroduced to Vank's character, their fight is brief, but some what exciting. At the end of the movie, Ironman and War Machine are in a fight with Vanko. There is a lot of down time in between, in which I felt more fight scenes could have been possible. Speaking of War Machine, Cheadle's character was excellent, there was no drop off with the absense of Terrence Howard, as Don Cheadle himself is a great actor.
  The other issue I had was the prolonged and somewhat unnecessary fight scene between Ironman and War Machine at Tony's casa. A scene which escalated out of conrol over Cheadle's insistance that Downey's Ironaman suit needs to be turned over to the goverment. I don't mind a good fight, even at the expense of some damage, but this was totally over board. It got kind of stupid quick.
  Overall, I would highly recommend the movie. The film ends well too, there were two possible scenarios that Marvel can go with character development after this 2nd installment of Ironman. I think a 3rd Ironman is very possible, I think Marvel needs to act on it quick as Downey isn't getting any younger. Both my kids loved this movie, as did my wife and I. On a scale of 1-10, I would give this movie a solid 9.

3840928,5,B0021L8V1Q,"I think this is an excellent, if not close to perfect, second installment in the series. We are now drawn deeper into some of the characters, ""warts and all"" as they say. A big part of the Iron Man story is that of redemption; not just physical redemption from the terrorists in the first movie, but the emotional and spiritual redemption from the many vices of Tony Stark. If these aspects of Stark are only given a surface treatment, there's no idea of why Tony is driven to continue to be Iron Man. The ghost of his father, the demon in the bottle, and the self-destructive behaviors all drive Tony to a need for redemption and salvation.

True, this isn't a solid, start-to-end, nothing-but-explosions action movie. There is actually some character development and interpersonal relationship development (Tony-Pepper, Tony-Rhodes, Tony-Fury, etc.) that all tie together the motivations behind Tony Stark/Iron Man. Without this, the character makes no sense.

But, there is plenty of action. The final battle probably has more action than most action movies, it's just packed into the last 1/4 of the film instead of spread out here and there.

I think this movie seems more real, as well. People seem to be searching for words, people talk over each other instead of waiting until A is done before B starts to talk.

The additional material would be worth the price alone. There are hours of stuff to watch, and I haven't gotten through all of it yet. It's nice that instead of just Iron Man, a large part of the Marvel universe is explored and shown how it ties together.

I can't think of a single reason not to recommend this Blu-ray/DVD/digital combo set...there is something here for everyone.",1287878400,,1702,4.835051546391752
3840929,3,B0021L8V1Q,"If I could give Iron Man 2 a 3 1/2 star review, I would.  When I went to see it soon after its release this past summer, I was initially somewhat disappointed.  The first Iron Man got so much right - a good, consistent storyline with amazing effects and a spot-on portrayal of a flawed, egotistical human being finding some sort of redemption through becoming a super hero.  But I would have to agree with many reviewers who felt that Iron Man 2 was incomplete and rushed.  I still enjoyed RDJ's characterization of Tony Stark and I liked the interplay between Stark and Pepper Potts, but I felt that Don Cheadle's character was wasted and frankly, Mikey Rourke's Russian gangster/ physicist felt out of place.  Plus (spoiler) when he first arrives at the race track early in the film, destroying cars, wreaking havoc - how hard would it have been for someone to shoot that guy?  He had no armor!  Anyway - it's a comic movie, so I don't expect too much logic.  Regardless, on later viewings, I find myself enjoying the film more as a popcorn movie, but hopefully the upcoming Marvel films and the Avengers movie will be have more of the feel of the first Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (which I really liked) or X-Men 2 than Iron Man 2.",1287878400,,1236,4.486607142857143

3840938,4,B0021L8V1Q,"A movie titled Iron-man but the villain steals the show. Growing up I never was that big a fan of Iron Man I always a fan of Batman and this movie made me realize why. Tony Stark is a superhero that enjoys his fortune lives lavishly and he's not afraid to let the world know it. Batman puts up the front of living lavishly and enjoying his life while underneath it all he's tormented and if he can't find peace for himself he'll find peace for someone else by becoming ""Batman"" and help keep the people safe in his city. The two Billionaires are complete opposites of each other. Even their corporations are complete opposites. Wayne industries focuses on improving the world while Stark industries focuses on how to destroy it. It's a very interesting way to look at the two successful comic book characters. Matter of fact the only thing that they have in common is that they are both just normal men with no true superpowers of their own (well maybe a huge bank account is a super power).

About the movie now...

Iron Man 2 reversed the roles. This movie actually make Iron Man look like the a-hole because of how he acts in the movie. He treats Iron man as though it's a symbol of just how big his ego is and just another reason why the world should bow down and kiss his feet. Tony Stark in this movie is not exactly the character you want to root for. It's basically 2 hours of a rich man's ego trip. ""I can do what I want because I'm rich and you should be thanking me"". That is pretty much all I get from these Iron man movies especially this one.

The Iron man scenes are just as great as the first one. The suit of armor never looked better and the scenes are intense. I was however disappointed with WarMachine. He was a character that they could have done a lot more with and perhaps given more spot light too than just a sub plot to further advance the story line. I also had a problem with the actor they casted as Warmachine. He couldn't be further off from being Warmachine, and he never sold me on him. I know they were originally supposed to have Terrance Howard and they should have got him for the role. He's an A-list actor and they should have paid his A-list salary. Because Don Cheadle is no WarMachine.

The one who made this movie worth watching for me was Mickey Rourke. His character is the one the movie makes you root for and to be honest he brought up valid points that no one seemed to answer and a question that Tony Starks pretended was never asked. Tony Starks deals in weapons...those weapons fall in the hands of solders...his weapons take lives and destroy countries, and Mickey Rourke's character was the ending result of that. Tony Starks weapons destroy his homeland, and Tony Starks father ruined his father personally. Ivan Vanko didn't seem so bent on getting revenge out of personal hatred as he seemed to want to make Tony Starks suffer for all the pain his weapons have caused... actually it was a pretty valid point.. but the movie just skipped over all that and made him the bad guy.

Overall Iron Man 2 was a good action flick if you liked Iron Man 1 You'll enjoy Iron Man 2. 4/5 for a sequel since there hasn't been a good sequel since T2 and Batman The Darknight.

3840952,2,B0021L8V1Q,"Although only one screenwriter is credited, ""Iron Man 2"" has the classic hallmark of scripts that have gone through multiple writers and script doctors: a plethora of disparate elements shoehorned together without regard for the narrative as a whole.

""Iron Man 2"" starts off promising, with an interesting conflict between Stark and the Federal Government.  The first 10 minutes set it up as ""Atlas Shrugged"" with a powersuit, featuring Tony Stark as Hank Reardon.  The Feds and their favored contractors are, unsurprisingly, not happy at being cut out of the defense business by a non-state actor.  Indeed, the enemies Iron Man faces in the course of the movie are non-state actors as well, a nod (conscious or unconscious) to the unsustainability of the welfare-warfare state.

But enough of that.  Instead of a tight, interesting movie, we get a bunch of diversions that keep Iron Man from encountering the Stinky Russian, his primary enemy, until 30 minutes in.  Mickey Rourke plays Stinky Russian, and you can darn near smell him whenever he's on screen.  OK, that's cool, but then there's some corporate succession issues, the pointless use of SHIELD, and Scarlett Johansson phoning it in as Stark's new assistant.  Every scene with her is grating and unnecessary.  Oh, then there are some other plot points that would be spoilers that I will avoid.  Rather than a complete narrative, we get bogged down in Act 2 and just stay there from a long time spinning our wheels.  Even when the movie finally gets going again, the climax manages to be anticlimactic.

""Iron Man 2"" is saved only by Downey, Rourke and Rockwell.  All three are so talented that they uplift the material and keep this move from becoming a complete trainwreck.  The cleverness and tight writing of the first movie is absent here.  Rent if you must, but you are likely to be disappointed.",1287446400,3,1864,4.926282051282051

Both of them were excellent! I first started reading Iron Man stories in the old Tales to Suspense from Marvel comics.  I loved the fact that his armor would evolve as the years went on.  But 2 things happened that made me look at him closer.  One was his problem with alcohol.  He got lost in the bottle.  Later was when he revealed to the world that Tony Stark was Iron Man.  I liked the fact that Tony Stark appeared more human with a real human flaw but never really liked the fact that his identity was public knowledge.  But I still bought the comics and even read a majority of them.  Now we have Iron Man in the movies and it's simply great.  Ray Downey Jr is  simply the best at playing Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man and Gyneth Paltrow plays a very good Pepper Potts.  They make this franchise work with their dialogue and romantic tension.
If you're looking  for a good sequel to the first movie then you've found it with Iron Man II.  The plot is well written , the story/main characters are well developed , the action scenes are excellent and the music rocks.  It's my hope that in the next Iron Man that an old time enemy of Iron Man shows up. Like: Titanium Man or The Mandarin.

3840958,5,B0021L8V1Q,"This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I was chuckling in the theaters and even more so when I was watching the DVD. The dialogues are that funny and extremely well executed by 4 of the best actors today. The four main actors (Downey, Paltrow, Rourke, and Rockwell) are all amazing actors and the acting level of this film itself makes this film worth watching.

I am not sure if I have heard of better banter between two members of opposite sex since Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant made the now legendary ""Bringing up Baby"" (1938).

The brilliance of Robert Downey Jr is that he makes Tony Stark, without his special suit, more interesting than the Ironman. He has real flaws and tries his best to cope with life's challenges and is not always successful. He also has definite weaknesses and is forced to rely on his friends. Make no mistake, Tony Stark is not universally admired nor even liked. His relationship with the Avengers are definite love/hate as his relationship with his Pepper Potts.

His relationship with Natalie Rushman (Black Widow) played by Scarlett Johansson, is probably funniest as he tries to deal with many facets of her chameleon qualities.  ""How do you do it?"", questions the astounded Tony Stark, ""You're a triple impostor! I've never seen anything like it! Is there anything real about you?"".

The action sequences are also great. The final fighting sequence, however, could have been little longer and elaborate as it ended too predictably.

I give strong kudos to the writers, the director, and the actors for executing a movie with such memorable dialogues and humor.

I wish the 3rd Ironman would be more like the 2nd than the original. The original Ironman was good, but not this good.

And Sam Rockwell? Lord, his performance reeked.  I wondered when he would ever shut his pie-hole.  He had diarrhea of the lips.  He talked a lot, but didn't say a damned thing.  This movie reminded me of the Batman movie with George Clooney and Schwarzenegger.  A seemingly great cast, occasional cool action, but crappy acting and a juvenile storyline.  It felt and sounded like all the actors got their scripts about five minutes before filming.  This movie could have been so great, but Favreau totally misfired on this one.  Total garbage that's not worth watching again.  It's already time for a reboot.",1287187200,5,951,4.544378698224852
3840981,2,B0021L8V1Q,"When I first settled down to watch Iron Man 2, I had some problems pretty much right off the bat. See, I couldn't quite get my head around why everyone cared so much about the Iron Man suit. Yeah, it's awesome, and I'll give you that it's way better than one un-suited person. I'm still not seeing how it's the equivalent of nuclear deterrence, though, or why North Korea and all those countries want one more than they want other, far more practical weapons, or how it could possibly insure world peace.

Then again, in the movie world it's pretty damn apparent that the Iron Man suits are all that matters. After all, as a general rule of thumb, if a character isn't wearing a suit, they're absolutely worthless. The main villain doesn't get revenge by shooting Tony Stark in the face while he gives a speech, unarmored, on a public state; no, he does the far more reliable plan of developing his own suit and slugging it out face to face.

While Whiplash is fighting Stark - and keep in mind that his suit is purely offensive; it has no armor - no security guards intervene in any way, despite the fact that a single bullet could've saved quite a few lives. Before Whiplash can finish Stark; he is hit with a car. Several times. This leads to the movie's most surprising moment: being repeatedly rammed by a few thousand tons of steel has no effect on this guy. In retrospect, however, it makes sense, because the car's not a high tech Iron Man suit.

Even once I'd managed to force myself to accept the superiority of the suits, I still found myself siding with the movie's villains more than its heroes. Not the disturbingly maniacal Whisplash, of course, but rather the US government, who, as far as I can tell, had the safety of its citizens as its primary concern. Their argument went something like: ""no weapon sufficient to make a nation a superpower should be wielded by one wholly unsupervised international mega-vigilante,"" and I have to say that I agree. For the first half of the movie, Stark responded by being arrogant and immature, not exactly inspiring me to change my mind.

But all right, I think we all know I was watching this the wrong way. The Dark Knight and Watchmen (the comic; I still haven't seen the movie) taught me that it's okay to look for something more than ""that guy just got totally owned!"" in a super hero movie, but that clearly wasn't what Iron Man 2 was trying to do.

Once I managed to beat the parts of my brain that kept tossing up all the reasons Stark should be thrown in jail and the government should take all his stuff, I managed to enjoy the movie, but even from an entertainment perspective, Iron Man 2 still fell short of the first movie. The main problem was that everything felt disjointed.

The movie's ace in the hole throughout was Robert Downey Jr., and though I thought his character was a bit of a bastard quite often, I was with him every step of the way. The first half of the movie was based on Stark's steady slide into depression, and this part was well done, with some very funny scenes. The resolution to all of Stark's problems, however, felt artificial.

The instant Stark's personal life ceased to be the focus, the movie turned to the villains. The problem with this was that the villains had, for most of the movie, been playing second fiddle. Hammer's sudden ability to compete with Stark felt like a symptom of Stark's problems, rather than a cause. As a result, having him and his psychotic developer suddenly step forward felt somewhat awkward (while still managing to be predictable), and the personal relationships never gelled with the external threat in the same way that they did in the first movie, leaving Iron Man 2 feeling like two aspects of Iron Man's life jammed together harder and harder until they fit. Sort of.

While not as good as the first, IRON MAN 2 is still a good, fun, entertaining film, one that my husband and I really enjoyed watching.

IRON MAN 2 basically picks up where IRON MAN left off.  It has been 6 months since Tony Stark revealed to the world that he is IRON MAN.  Stark is fighting to keep his technology from being weaponized by the government, still attempting to achieve world peace, and this time, he is also fighting for his life.

The returning cast of IRON MAN 2 (Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson) continue to be outstanding, and the newest members (Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell) are definitely up to the task.  New comic book super heroes and super villains (Black Widow and Whiplash) are added to the mix, and are very fun.  The special effects are top notch (especially dazzling are Whiplash's electric whips), and the plot is enjoyable, though not quite up to the level of the first IRON MAN.

It looks like there is going to be an IRON MAN 3, and I hope that the get back that special ""pop"" that the first movie had.  There are also going to be a number of spin offs, most notably one for Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.  Hopefully, these movies, too, will live up to the original IRON MAN.  I guess we will have to wait and see.

Overall, IRON MAN 2 is very engaging, lots of fun, and definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first IRON MAN.  RECOMMENDED.",1287187200,4,1688,4.531353135313531

3840986,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man 2 is another sequel to a comic book action film that works, and may even exceed the quality of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/its-predecessor/dp/B001GAPC1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">its predecessor</a>.  It is a sequel to 2008's Iron Man and other than James Rhodes (who was portrayed by Terrence Howard in the first film but is now played by Don Cheadle) the cast has returned.  It is hard to rave about a movie that is for the most part a simple sequel that isn't a huge improvement on the original, but on the other hand the first film was so good it's important to include Iron Man 2 as among the best comic book films to be made so far within a relatively newer sub-genre in its renaissance.  Jon Favreau directs and once again walks a fine line between serious drama and kitsch with great success.  He has to be one of the brightest filmmakers doing pure Hollywood blockbusters today.  He's a filmmaker doing what he wants and having fun with it, but making the suits very happy.

Iron Man 2 brings the arrogant drunk arms dealer Tony Stark, whose just charming enough to like, back but under the scrutiny of  Senator Stern (played by Gary Shandling) for withholding a serious weapon; himself.  Stark is human enough to work on screen and it makes it all the more intriguing when we see a flawed personality like him make good decisions.  He is a greater hero than most casual comic book readers give him credit for and it is nice to see this franchise get this kind of outstanding treatment.  Tony's Iron Man technology is something that Stern feels could get into the wrong hands and used against the United States, but Stark quickly demonstrates that this just isn't the case. Of course the film's most notable baddie demonstrates otherwise when he shows up and attacks Iron Man himself.  He is Ivan Vanko, a maniacal super genius physicist who has harnessed some of Stark's technology to create giant appendages that can cut cars in half.  In the spirit of the comics Vanko is aesthetically an interpretation of the more obscure Whiplash and that is his name, but he is essentially The Crimson Dynamo as I remember him, and Ivan's father (a rival of Stark's father) even bears the classic villain's real name, Anton.  Either way it is a fantastic hybrid and with Mickey Rourke at his absolute best Iron Man 2 has a villain more than worthy of top praise.  Whiplash is awesome and I was openly cheering for him the whole time.  He is funded by naive and clumsy Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell) who is really the archetype rich boy villain.  He's like one of those rich guys on those horrific reality shows that everyone hates with blind passion.  He is Tony Stark without the witty humor, ethics, intelligence, and style.  He's Tony Stark if Brett Ratner directed Iron Man.  Regardless, Hammer is a great villain and Sam Rockwell deserves some praise for a truly thankless performance.  All these great casting choices and I almost forget to mention that Iron Man gets some awesome help with the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the first screen appearance of sexy future Avenger Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and of course James Rhodes, who becomes War Machine.

That is of course a summary worthy of some top of the line special effects and that is what these movies need if they are going to make big money.  They get it here within some outstanding action scenes, but Iron Man 2 deserves extra praise for being a thoughtfully written film that truly puts together one of the best casts I've ever seen for roles like this.  Gwenyth Paltrow (who returns as Pepper Potts) and Robert Downey, Jr. have chemistry well beyond the standards of normal action fare and Jon Favreau himself lends some legitimate comic relief, a staple in these films, hamming it up as Happy Hogan.  This is a fantastic action film that puts all the elements it takes to make a good film in their right place.  One nitpicking might be that I wanted to see more duel screen time for Rourke and Downey, Jr., being that both actors are at the top of their game and making us forget that they are still in the midst of their respective comebacks.  Iron Man versus Whiplash is turned into a rivalry that tops all but Batman and The Joker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>.

I bought the 3 disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo thinking that the digital copy would be from Amazon or some other retailer, but it's not. It's a disc that you insert, and then you go to a website (Columbia House I think?) and try to redeem it. The only issue is that they no longer have Iron Man 2 as a choice...so if you want a digital copy, just save yourself the hassle and just buy the Amazon VOD version. At least you'll get it on Disney Movies Anywhere and play it from basically any streaming device.

Original Review:

I was a huge fan of the first Iron Man movie, and could not wait for the sequel. Having rented Iron Man 2 at Amazon VOD, I was surprised at how little action there was, when compared to the first movie. The majority of the action takes place in the last quarter of the movie.

Now don't misunderstand me, this was a good movie and a good sequel, but I don't feel that it was better than the original. Some of the side stories were interesting, but this movie felt more like a setup for the Avengers movie. Scarlett Johansson was pretty good as The Black Widow, and Don Cheadle was a suitable replacement for Terrence Howard, though I would have preferred that Favreau swallowed his pride and kept the original cast in place for the sequel. Unfortunately Mickey Rourke didn't receive enough screen time in my opinion.

All in all the movie was a 3.5-4.0, compared to my 5 star rating for Iron Man. It was a good movie, but Favreau could have done better.",1286755200,,1496,4.405797101449275
3840991,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Robert Downey, Jr. is back as Tony Stark. Once again, Downey proves he is the best man to fill the Stark shoes as he makes a dramatic drop onto the stage and is surrounded by dancing women wearing lights in provocative places. You are never sure if he is the CEO of a major weapons manufacturer or a member of the Rat Pack. It seems he is the only cast member who stayed in character during the two-year vacation from part one. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts comes across as jealous and angry through most of the film and LTC James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes is played by a new actor, Don Cheadle. We see a darker side to Tony as he drinks more, parties more, and seems to care for Pepper less. It is inferred that he is distancing himself because he is slowly dying. Unfortunately, there is never a long enough break from the action for a proper scene to explain it all. Mickey Rourke, hot off of his rave reviews from The Wrestler, dons a Russian accent to play Ivan Vanko, the new super-baddie in town. Vanko is just a puppet for corporate baddie, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), to hide behind. Neither Rourke nor Rockwell live up to their previous acting hype and combined, do not compare to the strong screen presence Jeff Bridges gave us in part one. A few surprises to the film are Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansson, the sexiest Black Widow to ever grace the screen. The film is reduced to being mostly an action flick with a few moments of Downey to wake us up.",1286582400,,1477,4.394160583941606

3840993,3,B0021L8V1Q,"IRON MAN II.  May he rest in peace. As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1.  But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film.

Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read.  Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot.  Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity.  Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch.  It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide.  What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept.  Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.  Grady Harp, October 10",1286582400,4,1379,4.502008032128514

3840995,5,B0021L8V1Q,"While I would give 4 stars to the theatrical release of this picture, the blu-ray package deserves the best rating.  It's packed with necessary features, and it looks absolutely fantastic.  This purchase rekindled my love for blu-ray, and I'm impressed with Paramount and Marvel's efforts.  In a world filled with useless special features, Iron Man 2 gives us what we really want, although I still want more.

The film has its problems, but its definately solid.  Some of the logic is absent, the plotwork thin, but the actors sell it and its nearly nonstop fun.  It dips a little bit in the middle, but all of its fanboy treats made me fall in love with the film.  I praise this film for squeezing great bits out from the Marvel universe, while still holding back a lot of big guns.  The film gave me a fun Iron Man vs. Villain story, while still introducing me to a few new cherished Marvel characters.  The biggest impact from Iron Man 2 is the undeniable tension it gives in me stemming from my desire to travel through time to see Thor, Captain America, and Avengers.  Iron Man 2 is a great film on its own, but what I love about it most, is that it promises a great future.

As I stated earlier, the blu-ray is worth your money.  Thankfully only one commentary exists (I'm tired of seeing the movie 5 times to learn all the secrets).  And its backed up by blocky behind-the-scenes featurettes.  I praised the second transformers movie, however flawed it was, for having a great blu-ray release.  Paramount knows how to give people what they want in their purchase.  Universal needs to abandon the U-control and get on board with what Paramount and Sony are providing.

*******Easter Egg*****
Watch the end of ""Building a Legacy"" on disc 2.  You will be awarded, after the credits, with a clip of Thor filming.  It contains an interview with the comic writing genius Michael J. Straczynski, and his humbled love for the film.  I literally raised my legs and started kicking like a little girl.

Good film, great blu-ray.  The film itself gave me all that I wanted, however sloppy it may have delivered it, and the blu-ray just nailed it.  The only thing I request in the next installment is that they give more logical reasoning for the plot.  The element creation plot, was a little hard to swallow for a chem major, and I don't think they'll be able to sell it with jokes next time.

3841011,2,B0021L8V1Q,"After how fresh and fun the original Iron Man was, I was dismayed to find that its sequel, Iron Man 2, was the textbook example of how NOT to make a sequel, and worst of all, the movie commits the cardinal sin of any would be blockbuster. Its boring.

Feeling more like a set up to a potential Avengers movie than a proper sequel, Iron Man 2 fumbles its incoherent storyline from beginning to end. Scenes are thrown together with neither rhyme nor reason, many of them could be cut and mean absolutely nothing to the entire film. At no point does it ever feel like anything is at stake, and one of the primary factors that results in that feeling is the absolutely awful villain, played here by Mickey Rourke, who gets the chance to shine during an action sequence at a race track, well publicized in the adverts, but afterwards, is essentially sidelined only to  briefly re-appear when convenient. The film also resorts to the worst possible way for a sequel to ""top"" the original. You liked the fight against 1 robot suit in Iron Man? Well here are fights with dozens of robot suits! Not only is the set-up of the action uninspired, but so is the execution. The action is lifeless, boring, unexciting, and by the end it amounts to nothing more than little dots flying in the sky and random lazers coming from various directions. Iron Man 2 is the posterboy for bad sequels. Its not as horrific as Spider-Man 3, but it is without a doubt a poor film in almost every area. I wish I could say that by the end of the film, at least Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark keeps the film feeling fresh, but no, even that ends up rote thanks to the dilution of the original character whose well known battles with alcohol have been a staple of Iron Man stories, and yet here are played for laughs. For shame.

The Iron Man 2 blu-ray however features excellent audio and video, and contains a decent enough set of special features, but I can't recommend the movie in good conscience.",1286409600,22,1981,4.466850828729282
3841012,4,B0021L8V1Q,"You would think that a 2 disc edition of a movie like Iron Man 2 would be loaded with special features. Maybe something like how they did Whiplash, behind the scenes, cast interviews, a little history on the characters Whiplash, WarMachine, Black Widow and Justin Hammer, etc. No they have the following:

-Commentary
-4 Deleted Scenes (2 extended, 1 alternate and 1 deleted scene)
-Behind the scenes on the Iron Man and WarMachine costumes mixed how they did some scenes involving them
-A little documentary on making the Stark Expo set
-The Shoot to Thrill by AC/DC music video
-The digital copy of the movie

These were all good but I would expect more especially if you pay the $22.99 or whatever you paid for the movie. They could have excluded the digital copy and crammed all the features into the 1 disc edition which only has commentary. Then also sell the movies in another edition with the digital copy.

Now for the movie. I don't care what people thought. I really enjoyed the movie. I have no idea what they mean by No story. I want reveal much so it won't spoil the movie. But you can clearly tell what the storyline is right off the bat.

It deals mostly with the ""Demon in a Bottle"" storyline which is considered the best Iron Man story ever. Iron Man deals with a new villian Whiplash (ok its a hybrid of Whiplash and Crymson Dynamo) played by Mickey Rourke. Other new characters include Natalie Rushman aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) and Justin Hammer.

The movie does have an issue of introducing too many characters but that can be ignored. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has a bigger role in this as he appears in a few scenes (mainly about talking about ""The Avengers"") as apposed to his after the credits scene in the first.

Like the first, there is an extra scene after the credits that sets up for Marvel's next big movie.

3841015,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Just for clarification: I am reviewing the 3 disc combo, not necessarily the movie, although the movie was good.

I like that studios are making the bigger releases available in ""3 disc"" combos, and Iron Man 2 is no exception.  Since BD tech is relatively new, not all of my friends or family have BD players yet, so being able to bring my DVD to their houses, while being able to enjoy the full 1080p at home, is a definite plus.  The ""Digital Copy"" is not so thrilling (the reason for the loss of the 1 star).  I have multiple BD's with digital copies, and I have not had a good experience with one yet, so I don't even bother anymore.  I'll just continue to watch my movies the old fashioned way until they finally do away with it (the ridiculous DRM or discs all together - the more likely scenario).  I now understand why movie pirating is becoming so proliferant; it's almost as if they would rather you downloaded an illegal copy then get to actually enjoy the one you paid for!

Things to consider when buying this 3-disc combo is that if you don't have a BD player yet, but plan to buy one and really want Iron Man 2 NOW, you can't go wrong.  If you probably won't buy a BD player, I would get the DVD alone instead (if they offer it, that is).  And if you already have a BD Player, and think the DVD is just a waste: maybe it is, but then again, maybe it isn't if you think about all of the people you know that don't have BD players and might want to borrow your movie, or have you come over to watch it with them.  And you can play the DVD in pretty much 99% of all laptops; so the DVD is a bit more flexible than the BD.

There is also a lot of extra content packed into this deal, some 3+ hours of it.  If you like all of this extra stuff, then that's just gravy on top of an already pretty sweet combo deal (assuming you enjoy gravy on your sweets).

Overall, for the great deal that I feel I got on this combo, it was well worth it and I have plenty of bonus material to keep me busy should I choose.",1286323200,7,2016,4.0606060606060606

I didn't see the movie in the theater so when I saw the Blu-Ray on sale for $13. I thought it was a great bargain.  Not so much.

The story really moves pretty slow, and the action scenes are few but pretty good.

The opening scene (2nd actaull scene) at the Stark Expo (think World Fair) is Tony Stark at his narsasitic high or low depending upon how you want to interpret it. But it is just one example of how they slow the movie down and make it drag along, it takes way too much time.  There were definetly NO Acadamy Awards given for editing or scripts in Iron Man 2.

The action starts about 35 to 40 minutes into the movie and its too late to resesetate the toxic script. At this point you finally get to see Ivan Vanko bring on the pain in the Monaco Grand Prix, slicing cars in half with his own Russian version of the ARC reactor and the PLASMA whips he uses to slice throug iorn. It is visually stunning for a few minutes but hardly worth the 30 to 45 minute wait.

They spend some time setting up the the stroy arc for S.H.I.E.L.D. and H.A.M.M.E.R as combatent government contractors and this means they have to write Nick Furry into the script, which seems kind of forced and clumsy.  The only elegant part of this is the introduction of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who steals the show in the final 20 minutes with the best action scene of the movie. (There is something hypnotizing about watching an attractive redhead rotating through Judiso space while kicking butt. Oh yeah, did I mention she is in skin tight black leather?)

The final 20 minutes of this Blu-Ray along with the extra features like the S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault and some of the tech details make it worth keeping.

Do I think Super Hero movies need to be ""elegant""? Yes, the writers have very little excuse when they have 30 years of storyline and material to draw on. The first Iron Man was far superior to Iron Man 2 and it was a bit clunky at times.

The best part of both of the Iron Man movies is Robert Downey Jr. He seems to be custom made or trained to be Tony Stark.  I just hope this flop doesn't scare him off and we end up with Zach Effron in his place for the Avenger movies.",1286323200,3,2327,4.265909090909091

Downey brings good acting and character, both ecentric and charming, which is about the only good thing I have to say about this nonsense.  Did anybody on the crew that made this movie actually read any of the original Iron Man comics? Did anybody read the stories, the history, the character background, etc?  Apparently not, because aside from taking the names from the original comic, nothing about the movie matches.  In this movie, Stark makes it clearly known that he is Iron Man, while in the comic series, he went to incredible lengths to prevent just that; not the least reason of which is that it would cause many of the same problems played for gags in this film. The movie is mostly action, of the type that appeals mostly to adolescent boys, where there is a lot of shooting and blowing up and crashing, together with a heavy dose of sexy women clad in skin tight outfits.  If anyone is interested in a plot, the nearest thing they come to is that Stark's iron man suit is stolen and copied. In the original comic series, it was very clearly stated that Stark had taken all kinds of precautions to prevent just that.  All recorded plans, all copies of the iron man suit, had multiple mistakes and booby traps built in to prevent anyone but Stark from making a working copy of the iron suit. So even if something was stolen, it would not do the thieves any good. Any copies made would malfuction in a variety of ways, or even blow up.  I kept waiting for such fail safe booby traps to be triggered as the military played with the iron man suit, but apparently the Tony Stark in this movie was not as brilliant as the one in the comic.  Apparently it never occured to him that someone would try to steal his work, and that he needed to take steps, not only to prevent the theft, but to render the stolen items useless to the thieves.  And Whiplash, who is the arch villian in this movie----laughable.  He appears, heavily armed to be sure, but also with his entire head, neck and upper torso naked and exposed.  Any cop, any security guard, with a gun and a good aim could have put a bullet between his eyes and ended the entire episode.  And shall we mention the betrayal of Stark's best friend, Rourke? What else do you call it when Rourke, never once trying to really find out what was wrong with his friend, marches in, orders Stark around, then beats him half to death, destroys his house, steals his life's work and completely betrays any idea of friendship.  The fact that he had ""orders"" was a piss-poor reason, in anyone's book.  And I cannot imagine Stark's attitude of ""forgive and forget"" at the end of the movie.  And Rourke gets an award at the end of the movie? For what? Betrayal of a dying friend, playing into the hands of a dangerous villian, stealing a friend's life's work, violating several dozen laws and endangering civilians, or generally being an ass?  And anybody who thinks that this movie's portrayal of Nick Fury of Shield is in any way accurate, did not read the same comics I did. And did everybody catch the finding of Thor's hammer lying in the desert after the final credits?  A set up for the coming Thor movie, one in which the makers probably did not read any of the Thor comics either.  If you are a young teenager, you will find Iron Man II entertaining.

Something obviously changed his mind, and he made a great, and very entertaining movie, just shy of the greatness of the first.  The thing that keeps Iron Man 2 bogged down from classic is too many plots.  In this movie there's a plot about Tony Stark dying, Whiplash Seeking revenge, Justin Hammer trying to out do Tony Stark, the Army wanting access to the Iron Man technology, Tony's dad issues, Tony and Pepper's relationship, and more avengers subplots.  It's not necessarily a bad thing to have a complicated movie, but many of the stories feel a little rushed, and weighed down by all the others.  However, getting past the many plots there is a plethora of reason to be entertained.  The action was pretty great, from the battle on the race track to final showdown.  The special effects are good as ever, and Robert Downey jr. really makes the character of tony stark shine in a way that he never did in the comic books, both by being likeable, as well as having depth.

3841024,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Director Jon Favreau continues to excel with Marvel's new superhero franchise in the exciting blockbuster sequel ""Iron Man 2"". With the world now aware of his secret, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is determined to ensure that his Iron Man technology doesn't fall into the wrong hands, despite the countless pressures from the US government to turn over his technology for military application. If knowing that his personal arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body wasn't bad enough, Stark must also deal with the vengeful scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and the greedy industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). ""Iron Man 2"" delivers everything that one would expect for a big Summer blockbuster sequel. Though it does fall short of the original, many of the key elements are still present in the sequel, and it definitely offers a very good dose of exciting action and impressive special effects. Robert Downey Jr. continues to dominate the role of Tony Stark. The cast also includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson.

""Iron Man 2"" is one of this year's biggest movies, and Paramount certainly delivers a standout fully-loaded 3-disc presentation that ranks as one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year. The blockbuster sequel is presented in a 2.35:1 HD format. The picture quality is excellent and its DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound is certainly amazing. Among special features, it includes a commentary track by director Jon Favreau, the four-part documentary ""Ultimate Iron Man: The Making of Iron Man 2"", 6 behind-the-scenes featurettes (Creating Stark Expo, Practical Meets Digital, Illustrated Origin: Nick Fury, Illustrated Origin: Black Widow, Illustrated Origin: War Machine & Working With DJ AM), picture galleries, trailers and 8 deleted scenes.

3841025,2,B0021L8V1Q,"I saw Iron Man a couple of years ago and thought it was flawed, but servicable. My wife and I just saw Iron Man 2 over the weekend and were really not very impressed.  Here are a couple of thoughts on it that may be helpful:

(i) Dialouge
As you have probably heard, this movie is big into dialouge and ""character development"" (At least, I think that's the term directors use when they unnecessarily load action movies down with lots of talky filler).  Most of these interactions are just grating and annoying (eg. Tony and Pepper; Tony and Rhoddy; Tony and Senator Stern; Tony and Justin Hammer; Tony and Nick Fury, etc.) Bickering, talking over each other, and being generally cheesed off at one another are not the same thing as witty dialouge or clever ripostes.  His Girl Friday this ain't.

(ii) The Main Character
In the first movie, Tony Stark was smug, but also ironic and interesting; in fact, despite the first movie's faults, I thought its protagonist was a refreshing antidote to all the dark conflicted loners you find in every other superhero movie.  In the sequel, Tony Stark is just a rich, obnoxious, jerk, mostly drunk and disrespectful to everyone else including his friends.  I don't like spending two hours with obnoxious, rich jerks.

(iii) Action
Not a whole lot of action in this one and not really anything that was overly impressive.  If you have seen the trailers to the movie, you've seen pretty much all there is to see. The final confrontation between Iron Man, War Machine and Whiplash lasts about 60 seconds or so.

(iv) Plot
MINOR SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW ******  The plot is.... well, there really is not much of a plot, as much as there is a basket of interrelated half-concepts tied together. It reminded me a little of The Phantom Menance where George Lucas decided he wanted certain elements (eg. a pod race; a space battle; a lightsaber fight) and then wrote a thin story to incorporate them.  The plot that does exist has holes a mile wide, lots of loose ends and a lot of stuff that goes nowhere.  As an example, Black Widow is written in, but really does nothing of note (she is a secret agent disguised as a notary in Stark Industries; even though her boss tells her that she is onto her, they are confidants in the next scene).  Nick Fury and SHIELD are introduced for the sole purpose of promoting Thor and The Avengers.  Jon Favreau writes in a fairly large role for himself (including an incredibly implausable action scene) which contributes nothing to the plot and is really for the sole purpose of giving himself some screen-time.  In sum, it felt like either the product of a committee or a bunch of last minute re-writes or re-edits.

(v) Embedded Advertising
Lots and lots of annoying promotional tie-ins from watches to software to cars to upcoming movies are scattered throughout.  They don't even try to be subtle.

Conclusion:
So, is it worth your $14.99 and Saturday night?  No, it really isn't.  There are a bunch of great summer movies that are just now making their way to DVD.  I would strongly recommend that you take a second look at those (Inception, anyone?) before putting your money down for this one.",1286150400,18,3165,4.664864864864865

3841028,4,B0021L8V1Q,"First of all, I loved the first Iron Man.  It ranks as my favorite superhero movie of all time behind Batman.  However, unlike the re-envisioned Batman franchise, the sequel in this case does not transcend the original.

One of the best parts of the original Iron Man was just how hilariously ""badass"" Tony Stark was.  He knew he was a champ, and basically used his superior intellect and wit to overpower all of his opponents.  This doesn't carry through to this flick.  For most of the film, his usual eccentric behavior is marred by his obvious fear of death.  Knowing that he's dying, he foolish engages in random idiotic behavior until eventually the viewer is forced to say, ""Grow the hell up bro!""  However, this movie is far from bad.  It still retains enough of its original charm to make it an enjoyable movie experience.  In addition, I loved Mickey Rourke's acting.  I've never heard of him before, but I'll be watching out for any future movies with him in it.  Fantastic job.

And on an off note, I didn't realize how dumb some of the plot elements in this movie are until a friend linked me a hilarious review about it on a random website.  I didn't really think about it while I was watching the film, but after I read this article I realized how ridonkulous it was for a ""genius"" to try to kill THE IRON MAN with an electric whip.  Not sure if linkings allowed but it's relevant so I'll add it anyway.  [...].  If anything, I enjoyed the movie even more because I started noticing all the hilarious stuff I'd missed before :D.

Overall, I'd give the film a 4/5.  The only thing I resented was the fact that Tony dropped about five notches on the ""beast"" scale.",1286064000,,1677,4.475247524752476
3841029,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Robert Downey Jr. continues down his comeback trail by reprising the role that made him the household name he always should have been (for the right reasons, anyway) as charismatic, fast-talking billionaire Tony Stark in Iron Man 2. The original 2007 film raised the bar for superhero films (a bar raised even higher by a certain Caped Crusader a few months later), and Iron Man 2 strives to match that mark. But unfortunately, it misses said mark.

When we last saw Stark, he was commiting the superhero cardinal sin - he admitted to the world that he is Iron Man, the armored sentinel of justice. Of course, this has upped his notoriety exponentially, but has also raised the ire of a whole new crop of enemies. The U.S. government wants Stark to give up the Iron Man ""weapon"" for military use, a campaign spearheaded by Senator Stern (Gary Shandling). Rival weapons dealer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) wants to put Stark Industries out of business. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of the man who helped Tony's father create the ARC reactor that powers the Iron Man suit and keeps Tony alive, builds his own battle suit and becomes Whiplash in order to exact revenge on Tony.

You'd think that would be enough to fill one movie, but no. On top of these foes, the ARC reactor in Tony's chest is slowly poisoning him. A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannsen), is much more than a pretty face. Stark's best friend Rhodey (Don Cheadle, replacing Terence Howard), suits up as Iron Man's ally War Machine, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is pressuing Stark to join The Avengers. Phew.

With Iron Man 2, director Jon Favreau feels the customary obligation to overachieve in order to out-do its predecessor, but its failure lies in just that. There's so much going on here, that you feel like you could make an Iron Man 3 out of half the stuff. What's worse is that some of the elements seem needless. Involving Nick Fury and Black Widow seems to serve more as a build-up to the upcoming Avengers movie than to serve Iron Man 2's actual plot, and Tony Stark hands over the CEO reins of Stark Industries to Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) seemingly just to give her something to do. This all helps to create a frivolous, unmomentous feel to the film, leaving the film lacking in emotional weight.

But that doesn't mean that the film doesn't have redeeming qualities. Robert Downey Jr.'s sly, witty portrayal of Tony Stark is like a beacon among a crowded cast of characters. And though the cast feels bloated, the characters are very well fleshed out, so much so  that it almost doesn't matter that the film is quite frankly light on action. But when the action does kick in, it's done very well. I just wish we got to see a little more. Like the original film, there's an extra zinger of a scene after the credits, but Iron Man 2's big reveal is not quite as ""geektastic"" as the surprise appearance of Sam Jackson's Nick Fury.

The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack allows you to watch the movie in just about every way possible, and includes commentary by Favreau, making-of documentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes. Also included is a S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault feature which includes bios of not just the Iron Man film characters but bios of other Marvel Films character (like The Incredible Hulk) that can be updated in the future with an internet connection, which will likely include Thor and Captain America, as those characters' films are aiming for a release next year.

In summary, the film is enjoyable, the characters are good, Robert Downey Jr. once again shines, and the action is well done, though the film feels overstuffed and a bit inconsequential. The extras are what you'd normally find on DVD's and Blu-Rays, though the updatable S.H.I.E.L.D. Vault is a creative touch.",1286064000,2,3845,4.7990936555891235

3841042,3,B0021L8V1Q,"I came to a realization last night as I sat in my home office while my partner watched Iron Man 2 in the other room. I had just as much enjoyment of the movie only LISTENING to it, as he did while WATCHING it.

To be honest I did watch some of it. When I needed to refill my wine I walked through the living room and looked at the current scene that was playing. So I probably saw about 20 minutes of the movie - I like my wine.

The effects were very high quality as one would expect - the lighting sabres of the Mickey Rourke character flashed on the screen and gave me a ""charge"". The briefcase suit was a clever gimmick - but it worked and I felt like I was watching a scene from the new Transformers movie (let's hope they get it right next time).

RDJr. is excellent as always. Plot, meh. It's been redone so many times - there was really nothing fresh about the PLOT itself. Bad guy. Revenge. Daddy. Arrogant military. Congressional oversight. Odd cameo from Gary Shandling. Seriously?

The other problem is that half the movie was boring, and half the movie was ""OH MY GOD!!!"" It was a roller coaster, but not in a good way. Pacing fell flat in the middle of the movie - then someone realized it and threw some action in to get the viewer's attention back.

It was, however, entertaining to see ""Guy Flegman"" as the bad-guy enabler. I miss him from Galaxy Quest. But - since that was the last big thing I remember him from, I didn't take his character seriously at ALL. The whole time I was hearing in my mind - ""expendable crew member"" - can you blame me?",1286064000,2,1564,4.217391304347826
3841043,4,B0021L8V1Q,"""Iron Man 2"" finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), billionaire owner of Stark Industries, very much out of the closet as Iron Man. He's enjoying the notoriety that superhero status has given him, gloating about all he has done for humankind in the past few years. Actually, his behavior seems out of control, and personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is increasingly frustrated by Tony's self-destructive antics. Little does she know that the palladium core of the arc reactor Tony wears is slowly killing him. Meanwhile, the US government is demanding that Stark turn over his Iron Man suits to the Defense Department. And a new rival, Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is building his own arc reactor to avenge an old score.

The ""Iron Man"" franchise continues to distinguish itself from other films based on Marvel Comics characters with its sense of humor. These are action-comedies that, perhaps ironically, also have the strongest socio-political subtexts. Leave it to Robert Downey, Jr. to play crazy, funny, and heroic at the same time. Sam Rockwell is an inspired, not necessarily obvious, choice to play Stark's arch-rival in business Justin Hammer, CEO of a rival defense contractor. Director Jon Favreau has done a great job with the visuals and managed to find the right tone as the film vacillates between high-octane action and slightly hammy comedy. ""Iron Man 2"" isn't as strong as 2008's ""Iron Man"", partly because introducing the SHIELD organization into the mix creates too many characters.

I'm not a reader of comic books, so the introduction of characters from other storylines seems odd to me. I understand that comic books do this a lot, but it can be problematic in a 2-hour film, where maintaining focus among a change of CEOs at Stark Industries, a sinister plot involving a Russian scientist and rival businessman, a crusading senator, a military friend who may be foe, a drunken and desperate hero, and a lot of explosions already presents a challenge. Scarlett Johanssen is probably fine as SHIELD babe Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, but I can't say that her action scenes were convincing. Other than that, ""Iron Man 2"" is a lot of fun and is happy to be over-the-top in everything it does. And its sly jabs at the defense industry are pretty funny.

The DVD (Paramount 2010 single disc edition): The single disc offers an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau. He talks a lot about his decisions, what he chose to do or not to do and why, the reason for the sequence at the beginning of the film, themes, what was included or had to be left out. It's a good commentary if you're interested in directorial decisions or cutting. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.

There was no interaction to develope any relationship between Cheadle and Downey's characters. As a reult Cheadle seems like an ass. To have him suddenly be an ally doesn't flow. Totally miscast and destroys any flow from the first movie. Cheadle tries to start by being sympatheic but their is no idication he is continuing Terrance Howards character. There is a no interaction until he's pissed because Tony's celebrating his birthday and steals the Warmachine suit. (What and ass)  To have him suddenly be Tony's best friend at the end of the movie doesn't jive(He's his best friend and he's never seen Tony drunk?

The action is very disjointed and the movie has no flow. Unlike the first movie this one seems to count on Robert Downey's charisma to carry the film.

3841046,3,B0021L8V1Q,"This is an intense action film at points. But at other points there seems to be too much cross-talk between Stark and his CEO (I find her voice to be particularly irritating).

Stark comes across as a spoilt brat that wants the world to be at his beck and call. The unit in his chest is slowly killing him and he resorts to recklessness as a solution. I feel that a successful person at that level would have been more mature and responsible.

The final battle scene is at night ... again a bit of a let down.

You have the same, if not even better amazing acting ( especially in Robert Downey Jr. ). You have an even better villian and ending action sequence better than the first film. There is continued awesome character development there as well. Seriously people? I find it amusing and hilarious that all these folks out there always cry for a movie like this to be made, with the amazing acting and storytelling. But as soon as this type of film is delivered they just have to step on and squash it. This kind of attitude seems to be the new fad and way of life this day and age.

3841064,4,B0021L8V1Q,"First off, all the people complaining that it was boring or had too much dialog and not enough action are true examples of the what the mainstream consumer has become, boring with no imagination. There's nothing wrong with saying ""I wanted more Iron Man suit action"", but making it a reason to dis character development and enjoying actor's performances over countless CGI battles shows a less than dedicated comic era group of people. These naysayers also seem to be the ones who's hormones got into a cluster over Scarlett Johansson, who was the biggest letdown in the movie. Yes, she's got nice boobs and she looks good in the outfit, but she is in no way The Black Widow, not even close. They took years of a strong female Marvel character with a rich history and background and reduced her to a SHIELD 'chick'. Don did a solid job of taking Howard's place as Rhodey, pretty much with the exception of Johansson all the actors did a great job and Johansson's failure was not her fault, she was poorly cast. There are plenty of comic book roles for a good looking blond with an American accent. Rockwell made a great Hammer and it was nice to see the sequel not fall into the trap other superhero movie sequels have by sticking in way too many villains. There were solid characters and Tony dealing with the fallout of being Iron Man. For those that actually read or have read comics, they will understand that Marvel heroes generally have a weakness, drawback, or some very hard personal history to deal with that takes its tole. I hope there is a 3rd Iron Man in the works and if not this will still make a nice lead into Iron Man becoming an Avenger.

I have been guilty in the past of just tanking a movie after watching it once because I went into it expecting something else. The only thing I can recommend is if you didn't like this movie, watch it again. Watch the bonus disk so you can get a sense of what the director and actors were trying to do with the movie and it might make more sense to you or at least make you respect how much effort went into it enough to give it another shot.",1285891200,,2100,4.3984575835475574

3841068,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man 2 is a fun, albeit flawed, sequel that also serves as more of a set-up for future Marvel movies.  That being said, this sequel doesn't have enough of what made the first film so much fun: action, Downey improv & banter, and a villain that doesn't get near enough screen time.  This time around, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is battling the blood poisoning that is slowly killing him, while also taking on rival industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Russian genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke).  Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Stark's love interest/assistant Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as James Rhodes (who dons the War Machine armor, and seems to wind up being a better acting choice as well), Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as the Black Widow, and Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury; all of which are pretty servicable, but once again, it's Downey's show, and he's loving every minute of it.  I personally dug Rourke's take on Whiplash as he proves to be the most interesting character here other than Stark, but his screen time is sadly lacking.  Still, director Jon Favreau (who has quite a bit of an expanded role here than he did the last time around as Stark's bodyguard) manages to weave a fun sequel, even if it doesn't have that same kind of magic that the first film had before it.  And of course, make sure to hang around after the credits.",1285804800,,1396,4.700819672131147

For one, there is too much going on and not enough time to delve into it. There's the relationship between Stark and Senator Stern, the relationship between Stark and Hammer, the relationship between Stark and Ivan, the relationship between Stark and Rhodey, the relationship between Stark and Pepper, the relationship between Stark and Natasha...just to name a few. In all honesty, any one of these relationships could hold up a movie by themself. Sadly, Favreau tries to shove them all into 2 hours. It works, but barely.

Along with all that, Tony is trying to cope with his looming death. Again, this alone could have held up the movie, but it was just another subplot which had to be explained away within twenty minutes. Granted, this subplot got the most exposure out of all of them, rightfully so, but it didn't get nearly as much exposure as it should've. I could have seen it continuing on to the third and final film.

Even though Favreau doesn't have enough time to delve into everything, he does well with the time he has. The dialogue is witty and fast paced, the acting is superb, and the action sequences are some of the best. In a way, Iron Man 2 is like Thanksgiving Dinner, there's so much to eat, it's all really good, but by the end you're thinking...""that was too much.""",1285804800,,1559,4.682481751824818

For those of us who enjoy all the ""bells & whistles"" on special edition dvds, this release is a real disappointment.

The 2 star rating is not for the movie. The movie is terrific and I would give it 4 stars. Unlike a lot of critics, I liked the story lines - especially the one involving how Stark was recklessly handling what he thought was his impending death. The low rating has to do with the fact that the extras are anemic at best. ""IM2"" has a total of 4 deleted scenes and 2 featurettes (the featurettes together totally 15 minutes), with the ""and more"" listed on the back cover amounting to an AC/DC video. THAT'S IT. They're all on the second disc, along with a digital copy of the film.

Unlike the first installment, and the big plus on THIS version that wasn't included on the first feature (double-disc edition) is Jon Favreau's director's commentary.

Does the commentary, 2 ""behind the scenes"" features totaling 15 minutes, 4 deleted scenes, an AC/DC video and the digital copy warrant the extra money for them when Paramount/Marvel obviously could have included so much more, given what they included on the first installment? Obviously, that's up to you...

I think Rourke played a great villian but the fight scene at the end did seem kind of short between Stark and Rhoades against Ivan but the action was great and to me there was plenty of it and its got quite a bit of A listers in it with Downey, Paltrow who i hope is in the Avengers film and if they Make an Iron Man 3, Cheadle, Rourke, Johanssan, Jackson, Bettany, and Favreau who is in the movie alot more which is fine by me because i think he should have been in more of the first one. My only problem was with the shipping because they dropped it off at the wrong place and it took me two days to find out where but to me that doesnt count agaisnt the movie it self so it still says at a 5 star. And for some of you that most likely turned it off at the end i would suggest you fast forward to the end of the credits because you get to see a small sneak peak of Thor so if you are looking forward to that you get to see his hammer but still it gives you something.

3841078,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Movie - 4.5

In 2008, Iron Man took the box office by storm garnering high praise from fans and critics alike and grossing over $500 million worldwide. Personally, I was very surprised at how I liked it for its storytelling, witty humor, and blockbuster production values. It was thoughtful enough in establishing Tony Stark as a meaningful character, while at the same time providing loads of entertainment. With expectations set high, Iron Man 2 has a lot of anticipation going for it. And while it doesn't quite exceed its predecessor, I think it's just as good. The plot opens up 6 months after the end of the first film and puts Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in the presence of a senate hearing where the government basically wants him to turn the Iron Man suit over at the ""interest of national security."" But being the egotistical, yet virtuous, man that he is, Stark defends his case with ease by nonchalantly proving it'd be safer under his own personal use. Seeing this from afar, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is sickened by Stark's actions and false pretenses and vows to put him in his place. In the meantime, rival weapons contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) takes notice of Vanko's ambition and offers his resources in a joint effort to take down both Iron Man, as well as an ailing Tony Stark. Narrative wise, IM2 is a little less personable than the first as we were introduced to Stark, saw him realize his guilt, then become Iron Man in an effort of redemption. Here, after discovering that his palladium chest piece is slowly killing him, Stark must face his own mortality in and outside of the suit. But at the same time, being who he is (i.e. very kept to himself), he refuses confide in anyone. As a result, it alienates him and tarnishes his more likable portrayal from the first film. However, once he comes to terms with his father's legacy, he realizes his mistake and strives to become, not just Iron Man again, but the Iron Man worthy of his Avengers candidacy. The real diverging point in IM2, though, (and probably something that's greatly divided the fanbase) is the excess of comic book elements thrown in. The additions of Nick Fury, Black Widow, War Machine, Whiplash, Justin Hammer, and his robot army might feel a bit overwhelming with their newness. But I personally love the feeling of expansion it gives, especially considering the massive amount of crossovers, cameos, and references that will have to be made when Thor, Captain America, Iron Man 3, and The Avengers movies are done. But don't let that deter you. Despite all of the extra components, IM2 is still fun to watch with a snarkier script, more brisk pacing, better special effects, stellar action sequences, and a star-studded cast of actors. The next two years can't come soon enough.

Video - 5.0

Iron Man 2 presents itself with a much fuller image than the first movie. I absolutely love the filmic texture this one has in comparison. The slightly darker look may throw some people off, but I think it helps a great deal in CG effects integration, making for quite a pristine picture. To start off, colors possess an amazing amount of vibrancy. Red, gold, orange, yellow, occasional blues, and a little bit of green (in the Japanese garden) dominate the palette presenting some very cool shots, especially for action scenes. Blacks are deep and inky, while shadow delineation reveals an adequate amount of depth in all the tiny little lines and textures, nothing less from a Blu-ray with a newly minted transfer. Contrast helps to balance things out and doesn't waver a bit in terms of saturation levels or screen lighting. Facial features and flesh tones look excellent, particularly Scarlett Johansson with her pouty lips and pretty green eyes when we see her for the first time and she gets into the training ring. But getting back to the CG, I have to reiterate just how flawless it all looks and fits into the picture and overall scope of the plot. I thought IM1 looked good. But considering how much more action-packed IM2 is, it's amazing to even contemplate the amount of work that went into producing this special effects extravaganza. You can pretty much use any of the action sequences as demo material for the video or audio. But if I had to narrow it down to specific scenes, I'd say the fight in Monaco is definitely good for contrast (being the only daytime fight scene in the entire movie), the meeting with Nick Fury for black levels (not a racial thing, he just happens to be wearing a lot of black, which shows some good detail in his clothes), and the final battle at the Stark Expo/Japanese Garden for overall color (lots of greens, pinks, and charcoals, especially recommended). There's a little bit of banding in the digital backgrounds, but it's only a minor quibble in an otherwise reference video presentation. There are no signs EE, DNR, or a single artifact to sully, yet, another very fine transfer from the people at Paramount.

Audio - 5.0

Like the video, the audio portion of this film also outdoes its predecessor. The DTS-HD track here is instant go-to material and very representative of the advantages of lossless audio in general. From the very beginning of the movie, we get an enticing tease of what to expect in terms of directionality, separation, and LFEs as the opening credits introduce us to some ominous music, Ivan working on his own Arc Reactor, and some pounding bass effects. Aside from the obvious gunfire and weapons mayhem, the sound design for IM2 greatly utilizes all four surround speakers. Crowd noise and cheering make up a good deal of ambience during the more low-key dialogue sequences such as the intro of the Stark Expo (minus the flashy entrance) or Stark's hearing in front of the senate. There's some especially nice reverberation in Downey Jr.'s voice when he speaks on the microphones, and I'm very pleased at how much clarity and buoyancy came through. Dynamic and discrete effects from Jarvis and all the little workshop noises are on par with the previous film, though I might even be inclined to say it sounds better as a result of the balanced score. The score, by the way, is a big improvement. No disrespect to Ramin Djiwadi for his catchy riffs and rhythms from IM1, but John Debney did an outstanding job fusing both a traditional orchestral feel, as well as a contemporary rock one (thanks in big part to Tom Morello for his guitar work). But of course, the real highlight of this audio track is its riveting display of action. All sorts of weapons fire fill the soundscape in every which direction with the rears and sub getting a good portion of the home theater workout. Explosions, palladium-powered armaments and flight, landing suits of armor, and other large machinery showcase some of the finest LFEs I've heard in retrospect to screenplay and mood setting. Again, the obvious choices to use for reference are any of the action sequences mentioned above. But don't be afraid to test the Stark Expo or Senate Hearing scenes either. Fans of the film will be quite pleased with this awesome presentation.

Extras - 5.0

For those who really enjoy special features, this combo pack comes loaded with hours of excellent production and background information. To start, disc 1 comes with an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau, a S.H.I.E.L.D. Vault trivia database, and a P-i-P pre-viz track that can play along with the movie. The commentary makes for an extremely entertaining and informative listen. Favreau maintains a good pace with lots of useful tidbits about the filming itself, elements of the story, and the occasional anecdote. This is probably my favorite feature of all the extras, as it really changed my overall perspective of the plot and its character development, as well as reconfirming my notion that it was all a result of setting up future Avengers stuff. He never leaves a lot of dead space and sounds very enthused about the work he accomplished. The Vault is a cool novelty that can be accessed from the menu by itself or as a pop up video track during the film via Footage Scan Mode. During the film, it doesn't do much. But as a standalone feature it provides a lot of interesting trivia for this building Marvel Movie Universe. Meanwhile, the pre-viz video track is exactly what it sounds like and makes for maybe one decent sitting at most. On disc 2, we get the meat of the making-of features. Ultimate Iron Man spans almost an hour and a half and covers just about everything up through post-production. The making-of they had on IM1 was great, and I liked how consistent this felt in conjunction to this proposed trilogy. Rounding out the rest of the relevant extras is another 30 minutes of Featurettes. Here, they give some extra coverage on set design and a little bit of background info on Nick Fury, Black Widow, and War Machine. When I first heard they were going to include these, I was expecting much longer segments like the 49-minute exposition they had for Tony Stark on IM1's specials. Unfortunately, the segments for these three don't even amount to half of what they had for Stark. But despite my disappointment, I still dig the commentary enough that I won't deduct any points. It's a very recommended listen.

Overall - 5.0

Iron Man 2 may be something of a mixed bag for general audiences, as the greater scope of things might be a little too overwhelming. I, however, have no qualms with the direction this took and am actually quite excited to see how things will eventually tie together when all the Avengers canon is complete. But regardless of what people may think of the story, IM2 is still heartful enough and is even more witty, charming, and thoroughly action-packed as the first. With reference A/V specs and a pleasing set of extras led by one of the best commentaries I've heard in a while, Iron Man 2 comes highly recommended, and is a must-own for fans.",1285718400,6,9913,4.768782760629004
3841079,4,B0021L8V1Q,"First and foremost, I will agree with other reviews that this movies action didn't stand up to the original. There was a quite a bit more talking and plot formation going on but it DID seem to be because of the introduction of new characters and foreshadowing to future events or even the Avengers movie.
The introduction of the plotline that the tech that Tony is using is killing him was a big story arc in the comics and was an interesting way to introduce the new arc reactor (triangle chest plate).
The replacement of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle was not a happy thought at first but after watching the movie, Don seemed more like War Machine in the long run. In the extra features, there are some good featurettes of War Machine's back-story and how the Military got ahold of the suit.
Someone said, they were upset that the Black Widow only does any action at the end and she is beating up cops. No..She is beating up security guards. There is a difference. It was a very short scene and we would liked to have seen more action from her.
Someone said, there was no explaination of why Whiplash (Mickey Rourke) hated Tony Stark. This is very false. It is somewhat explained in the movie that Tony's dad was credited with the arc reactor tech but if you look at the spec's or blueprints, Whiplash's fathers name is clearly on the spec's as a designer and they even tell you that his father was a scientist/physicist and Whiplash was also a very accomplished physicist before his family's downfall. Whiplash himself explains that if it wasn't for his father, Tony and Whiplash wouldn't be the men they are.
Make sure to watch the short scene after the credits. hint hint
Do not let these 2 star reviews sway you. Although it does not stand up to the action you would expect from an Iron Man movie, I will still give it 3-4 stars for the movie in general.

END OF SPOILERS:

Although ""Iron Man 2"" isn't quite as strong as the first film, it has more than its fair share of strong action sequences and witty one-liners. The main flaw with the film is the amount of characters and subplots stuffed into the film. Still, director Jon Favreau working from a script by Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder"")manages to keep us interested with some truly innovative looking action sequences.

Special features include a commentary by director Jon Favreau, animatics/illustrations of key scenes playing in picture-in-picture mode with illustrations by animation director Gennedy Tarovsky (""Dexter's Lab""), interactive ""Shield Mode"" that allows you to see trivia about the hardware and weaponry (as well as monitor the toxicity levels of Stark's blood) throughout the film, a documentary and a number of fine featurettes.

3841084,5,B0021L8V1Q,"If you're reading this review, it probably means you didn't see the movie in the theater. I saw it several times, at least once in IMAX, and I was genuinely concerned that a smaller screen could never do the movie justice.

Hard to believe, but there is a whole group of people out there that absolutely hate super-hero movies. That's because super-heroes don't do a very good job representing us. We have a hard time seeing ourselves in the super-hero's shoes, because they're so much larger than life.

On the contrary, Tony Stark is someone that a guy like me can easily relate to. No, I'm not a multi-billionaire or the son of an iconic genius-inventor / modern renaissance man.

Tony Stark is a man. He's an alcoholic, and a womanizer, and he knows that money can't buy happiness. He's a charismatic leader that can charm an audience with his wit and humor, and he has developed a track record for being a hero with which no villain should even attempt to challenge. He's an athlete, and a fighter, and he has gone toe-to-toe with all manner of villains already (none of whom we get to know anything about--we just have to assume.)

Don Cheadle gives a very understated performance, but he plays the part well. I do appreciate the fact that he's a serious hero that kids will love, and he also happens to be African-American (something that's not usually true of super-heroes.) War Machine is a force to be reckoned with, and Don Cheadle does a great job exhibiting the type of maschismo that would go hand-in-hand with suiting up in armor that makes one a virtual one man army.

ScarJo also does a great job...But no one would have cared no matter how bad her acting proved to be. She's Eye Candy at it's very finest, and watching her in her form-fitting outfits is something akin to staring at the sun during an eclipse. I'm serious: she's so smoking hot, I couldn't figure out why Tony wasn't trying to put the moves on her. There's a scene on the night of his birthday party, when he's clearly getting drunk, and I suppose a lesser man would have been all over her. Not Tony, though. It's clear that he's already made his choice: Miss Pepper Potts.

The movie has its flaws, and it has its fair share of detractors. Critics that I trust implicitly have stated unequivocably that they loathed the movie, which really hurts my heart. I loved this movie, and I intend to find out how many viewings I can get out of a Blu-Ray before it has to be replaced.",1285545600,3,2460,4.51685393258427
3841085,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I've loved Iron Man ever since my first Tales of Suspense comic, so I might not be the most unbiased person to write a review.  Still, I'm going to try and be as honest as I possibly can.  In some ways, Iron Man 2 improves on the original.  For instance, the brawl between Iron Man and War Machine was perfect, and RDJr was even better this time around.  However, there were some weak moments.  For example, Pepper Potts is almost absent from the movie, and is shrill and unpleasant during her brief appearances. Whiplash has never been a particularly compelling villain, and the movie doesn't do much to make him any more exciting.  Also, they really need to STOP with the ""Iron Man fights someone who has the same technology"" plots.  It's already boring.  Plus, I couldn't help but wonder where a drunken hobo managed to get the equipment to build an Arc Reactor. Stark did it in the first movie because he had several billion dollars worth of his own weaponry to cannibalize. How does a homeless Russian manage it?  Furthermore, the character of Justin Hammer was silly and played for laughs, which was the wrong move.  It had a real ""Jim Carrey in Batman Forever"" vibe to it.

Others have mentioned the unnecessary plot lines, and they're right.  We could have done entirely without the ""Paladium Poisoning"" and the ""Under House Arrest by SHIELD"" plots, since neither of them really went anywhere, and felt like padding in a movie that didn't need any.  I didn't mind the Black Widow showing up, but eventually it felt like we were tripping over minor characters.  Also, they're not fooling anyone with the whole ""The Avengers don't want Tony Stark"" subplot.  None of us believe for a moment that they'd do an Avengers movie without the only Avenger that's proven to be a box-office success.

Still, it was a good movie.  Perhaps not a GREAT movie like the first one, but at least it wasn't a franchise-killing fiasco like Spiderman 3 or Batman and Robin.  Honestly, if none of us had ever seen the original Iron Man, we'd all be talking about how this movie was one of the best Comic Book movies ever.  But as it is, it's over-shadowed by it's phenomenal predecessor.",1285545600,167,2172,4.638743455497382
3841086,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Okay...I have seen the reviews that others have written, but doesn't it really boil down to a simple question?
""If I watch this movie...will I enjoy it an have a good time?""

Iron Man 2 is a summer action movie, pure and simple, it is what all summer action movies are.  Suspense of reality and entertainment.

If that is what you are hoping for, then you are in luck.  If you have kids, then you are really in for a treat.

My two sons, 6 & 12 and my wife and I all went to see this at a theater and EVERYONE enjoyed it.

So I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a movie that they will watch again and again.

Now, if you are the type that expects everything to be true to the original comic series...then read a review by someone who is more familiar that aspect and make your decision based on that.  BUT, if you are looking for a fun movie for the entire family....and if you are willing to suspend disbelief...then look no further!",1285372800,,952,4.220994475138122

3841088,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Let's get this straight: If it hadn't been for THE DARK KNIGHT coming out a couple months later, IRON MAN would have been THE superhero movie of 2008.  It's still one of the best entries in the genre, with a complex plot, superior special effects, and the quick wit and sharp poignancy of Robert Downey Jr.

The sequel, while featuring all three, is a letdown; while I knew to lower my expectations, they still weren't met.  The problems here are two-fold: miscasting, and a script that doesn't dare to be dark enough.  For the miscasting: obviously, Downey is still in fine form, though he doesn't get to ad-lib as much here.  Mickey Rourke doesn't have a whole lot to do; he and Downey share one (and only one) non-combat scene together, which is indeed a highlight of the film, even with minimal dialogue--proof that, when you put two great actors together alone in a room, you'll get great things.  Don Cheadle simply does not have Terrence Howard's charisma; he's a fine actor, but the role of Rhodey calls for more than mere talent.  Scarlett Johansson is utterly wasted; she's an amazing actress, but she's here for eye candy and nothing but.  Gwyneth Paltrow is as charming here as she was in the first film; and Sam Rockwell, in an utterly two-dimensional villainous role, does the best with what he's got.  Sam Jackson does his Sam Jackson thing as Nick Fury; take it or leave it, unfortunately his character isn't that essential to the film.

Now for the script, from otherwise-talented scribe (and actor) Justin Theroux.  It's not deep; it's not dark.  And yet it tries to be both.  Is Rourke's Ivan Vanko justified in his anger towards Tony Stark?  Was Stark's father maybe not the paragon of virtue that Tony always thought?  How is Stark coping with the fact that he's dying (not a spoiler, by the way; you find out early enough)?  These are deep, penetrating issues, which promised to elevate IRON MAN 2 to an almost DARK KNIGHT level.  Instead, when a problem arises, we have an answer within a few minutes, miraculously provided by a minor character.  The movie doesn't deal with issues--it avoids them like the plague.  The first IRON MAN had a dark underbelly; it was never overly prominent, but it was there, lending the film an edge usually missing from the genre.  IRON MAN 2 is more family-friendly; it's meant to be a pleasing popcorn flick and nothing more.  It should have been more, which is why the film comes off as so disappointing.  For a film with such talent behind it--director, writer, cast--IRON MAN 2 fizzles halfway through, never reaching its potential, never being what we all wanted it to be.  It's less than the sum of its parts; it's still entertaining (hence the 3 Stars), and it's worth a repeated viewing or two, but in a post-IRON MAN/DARK KNIGHT world, we need more from our superhero movies than guys in costumes finding other guys in costumes.  We need depth, and you won't find much here.  The most poignant thing here is Vanko's love for his bird; for avian enthusiasts, maybe that's enough.",1285372800,5,3044,4.69811320754717
3841089,3,B0021L8V1Q,"It was a fun movie overall, as expected.  The action and high tech tone was overdone but still entertaining. is a common problem in higher budget movies, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As self absorbed rich guy Tony Stark, the actor has to fight with no less than three villains, two other figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in the needyest sense,  depending on the plot unwindingness. The story picks up Stark about 5 months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life. Meanwhile, crazy bird loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is planning revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit,  Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James , whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's self destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is shown in an shady manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time.

If you watched the first one, this is a good sequel explaining the missing details in the first one, and bringing it along, enhancing the underlying plot with Samuel Jackson and the league. It can get slow at times, but when action comes in, it PACKS in. With moderate violence, and other elements, it is not necesseraly a movie for younger kids not in their teens. Although, in certain families, it might be appropriate according to the rules of the house. With the plot, it becomes both a personal vendetta, and a redeeming love for starks father. When the twist comes, and once again as in the first one, the general enemy's of stark turn against each other, it really brings up the climax, peaking with the final chase, and slowly accelerating until the final moments of the movie. Although it comes to a quick conclusion, this is a worthwhile watch, and if it's in your tastes, buy it. If not, then don't. It simply comes to that.",1285113600,,1090,4.566326530612245

The current studio system -- big budget and big bang for teenage boys -- has made Marvel into an empire, and now that it's obvious Hollywood has milked each individual comic it's time for cross-overs.  We saw Iron Man appear in the final scene of that colossal waste of time called ""Spiderman 3,"" Silver Surfer appear in the movie that shouldn't have been called ""The Fantastic Four 2,"" and now ""Iron Man 2"" hints darkly at an Avengers movie series.

There's really nothing to recommend watching ""Iron Man 2"" (I watched it on the airplane, and I still couldn't stand it).  Robert Downey is the most charismatic actor on the big screen right now (even more so than Johnny Depp) but even his charisma can't sustain a movie with stupid dialogue and a ridiculous plot.

3841096,3,B0021L8V1Q,"SPOILER ALERT!

Word has it that Robert Downey Jr. requested the screenwriting services of Justin Theroux, who was one of the writers of Tropic Thunder.  Tropic Thunder was hilarious.  Iron Man 2, overall, was not.  It seemed like a poor attempt for Robert Downey Jr. and Justin Theroux to make Iron Man more comedic.  Jon Favreau should have known better.  While Iron Man has some funny moments here and there, the character is not supposed to be funny overall.  We had some light moments in the original film that worked really well.  But in the end, Stark was true to his goal and he took it seriously.  In this film, Stark seems to take nothing serious at all.

Iron Man 2 tries to be a lighter movie than the previous one, while taking on a ""darker"" spin on the character of Tony Stark and his new nemesis, Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash.  Iron Man 2 fails on both fronts.

Iron Man 2 isn't nearly has fun and innovative as the first film; a movie that had plenty of action and charm, with enough characterization for Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, and Obadiah Stane.  In this film, Iron Man casually makes only a couple of appearances, and it isn't enough to keep the audience involved.  Tony Stark dominates the film.  We see very little of Pepper Potts at all, and what could have been a great character in Ivan Vanko, is all but placed secondary to the very goofy Justin Hammer, poorly played by Sam Rockwell.

Tony Stark's battle with alcoholism is addressed here.  In the comic books, it is tragic, and we see the fall of a great character and his battle to overcome it.  In this film, they chose to make Stark look like a buffoon.  He spends his time drunk, dancing around ridiculously in his Iron Man suit, and even making a silly bathroom stunt by ""showing"" his fellow party friends how Iron Man goes to the bathroom in his suit of armor.  It doesn't work.  The laughs that the filmmakers were hoping for were sporadic at best when I was at the premiere showing.

Ivan Vanko is actually a combination of two villains...Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo.  They actually set up a good premise with this character; a Russian man who is the son of an inventor who worked with Tony's father.  When tragedy struck Ivan's father, he obviously holds Tony Stark responsible and vows revenge.  Taking on the mantle of ""Whiplash,"" and utilizing the same technology that powers Stark's Iron Man suit, Vanko creates two energy whips that can cut through metal like butter.  It's too bad that we're only given one short battle between Iron Man and Whiplash before, in a very predictable fashion, Vanko ends up fighting Iron Man in, guess what?  Another suit of armor!

In the comics, Justin Hammer is a cold, ruthless man who views Stark as an obstacle that must be removed, since he runs a rival company.  Instead, we're treated to Sam Rockwell who makes Hammer look clueless in anything he does.  It's truly sad that one of Iron Man's premiere villains was reduced to this.  Normally, I don't like to bring up comic book comparisons, but in this case, they completely missed the boat with this character.  Rockwell plays Hammer like he, himself, has no idea what the character is like or what he is supposed to be about.

Don Cheadle takes over as Rhodey and he does a good job with the character.  We are treated to the addition of ""War Machine,"" the armored superhero that Rhodey becomes.  Gwyneth Paltrow's character didn't have enough screen time, and her interactions as Pepper Potts with Tony Stark are too few and far between.  This is a shame because these two characters worked very well in the previous film.  The light banter between Potts and Stark in the previous installment is nearly gone in this film.

Another great character that we see way too little of is Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow.  People seemed to wake up in their seats when she finally takes to the screen in her tight, black outfit and making short work of a score of guards when she breaks into Hammer's facility.  Too little screen time hurt the characterization of what should have been an interesting character.  Many superhero films make the big mistake of having too many characters.  This film finds itself among those.

Iron Man 2 has a few redeeming things that keep it from becoming a total failure.  The actions scenes are, for the most part, well done.  Unfortunately, we see too few of them.  The attention to detail as Iron Man soars through the skies in the original film have disappeared in this film.  It's too bad.  So many people were in awe when Iron Man first takes to the skies in the first film.  The special effects are still top rate.  It's too bad there wasn't a good enough story to go with it.

Iron Man 2 has its moments here and there.  It's worth one viewing, but frankly, I'm casting this one aside with Spider-Man 3, Superman Returns, Ghost Rider, and some of the other ""failed"" superhero films.  I don't know if any recent comic book film held such anticipation for its fans, and ended up being such a bitter disappointment.

With Favreau, Downey Jr., and the rest of this talented bunch, they should have been able to deliver.  They didn't.",1284768000,5,5147,4.602860286028603

The acting across the board was very good and Faverou's direction was good as well.  Iron man 2 on the other hand suffers from the same problem as many superhero sequels have over the years, too many characters.  The film seems to lack focus.  Several characters pop in and out of the film without much development.  Don Cheadle as well as Mickey Rourke's characters were given little to do.  The Iron Man and War Machine fight was so poorly conceived that it just felt forced and contrived just get another fight scene into the film.

  The editing of the film just seemed off as well.  Scenes that should have been cut just went on and on.  In several scenes, it seemed to me like the actors were just improvising their dialogue.  It's almost as if Faverou was a little too hand's off with his direction.  The story just seemed to amount to little more than a precursor to the eventual Avengers film.

The original had heart that balanced Tony Stark's narcissistic personality and his scenes with Pepper were cute and amusing to watch.  The scene where his arc generator needs to be replaced is hilarious because it is a life threatening situation but Tony doesn't seem phased at all.  In the sequel, there are very few redeeming scenes, and they seem to have wasted all the budget on extravagant locations and the Stark Expo.

The single scene that was somewhat moving is when Tony discovers the message from his father Howard.  And Mickey Rourke's Vanco character could've had a great tie-in to the main plot if he held the key to saving Tony's life.  Instead, he just becomes a de facto villain and we have the ""Roger Roger"" bots that obviously are not going to cause any problems apart from a few bullet holes here and there.  Jeff Bridges was a much better villain than Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke put together.  The scene where he gets drunk and gets in a fight with War Machine is quite moronic and juvenile.

All I'm going to talk about it the lack of action in this movie (and series in general). I felt like this was an episode of the West Wing where the President (in this case Tony Stark) is getting pulled, manipulated and exploited and in the end it comes down to he and his real friends to get him out of the dilemma. I understand that the budget for Iron Man 2 was greatly increased from the first movie, but where was that money spent? Other than the Stark Convention floor, I didn't see anything in this installment that was any grander than the first. I feel like there's nothing but juxtaposition and exposition. No huge action scenes at all. For every hour of action, there is literally one minute of action. The action finale is a jumbled mess of angles and shots that leave a lot to be desired. I can only equate the finale between Stark and Whiplash to that of a charcoal grill that gets left unattended before the meat goes on. Sure, you can put more gas on the fire to get it hot again, but its going to be a few moments of flash and then back to being orange coals. I love the dialogue in the Iron Man movies, and I believe that it is the dialogue that sets these movies apart from the rest of the comic book films that have come out to date, but the third movie HAS to up the ante or it will become a one trick pony.

Also, I had a huge issue of the writers forgoing using the ""Demon in a bottle"" storyline for this movie, instead they use the arc reactor in his chest to ""poison"" him. Iron Man had a few stand out story lines since its creation and none were more human that demon in a bottle. They really dropped the ball on that part too.

All in all, I'll still buy the blu ray on release date. I'll still praise this movie and recommend it to friends. But in ten years, when we've only got 3(4 if we're lucky) Iron Man movies to go back and view, it'll be a lot of missed opportunities in this franchise.",1280707200,2,2054,4.145363408521304

I've read a lot of people give credit to IM2 for ""sheer entertainment value"" they should also acknowledge that it's smart, well structured and offered GREAT performances. Oscar level performances to go with the thrills and the laughs mark a huge winner in my book. Iron Man was a great film but IM2 took everything movie one did and expanded on it. Iron Man was a great film but IM2 took everything movie one did and expanded on it. After going darker and deeper with Tony, they placed him again in ""creator"" mode just like the first movie.

Add the best final act in comic movie history and why wouldn't this be called one of the best ever?",1280534400,,768,4.453900709219858
3841111,2,B0021L8V1Q,"I really enjoyed the first Iron Man.  (I liked the Dark Knight more, but eh what can ya do?)  I thought as a super hero origin story, the first Iron Man was surprisingly well done and it felt surprisingly relevant with current events.  However, Iron Man 2 was another matter.  The story was completely pointless.  If you were to skip this movie and go straight into the Avengers, I'm willing to bet you won't have missed a thing story wise.

Nothing of substance happens.  There was no real character development.  There was the extremely hokey and cheesy creation of a new element and Iron Man fought a bunch of robots. That's it.  The villain, who doesn't have a protective suit of armor, is able to withstand at least three encounters with the front of a car and a cement wall. Why? We don't know. Apparently he was from Krypton or there was something in the vodka!

Tony Stark falls as a person, his relationships are tested, blah blah blah..  The villain shows up at a race track because the script says so. There's no rhyme or reason to it. (Why did he pick that spot? How did he know Stark would take part in the race when it appeared even Stark did not know he was going to be taking part in said race?....)  Note to Hollywood: this wasn't good story telling!

Some people have defended the movie because it's a sequel or because of RDJ's performance.  The first excuse I don't buy. Seems like many comic book sequels are superior to the original.  Look at X-Men 2, Spider Man 2, The Dark Knight.  Those were great comic book sequels.  Iron Man 2 won't be in that list.  As for the second excuse, I kind of agree and if there was a bright spot in the film it was RDJ.  However, even he couldn't save this mess.

Long story short, this won't be going in my blu-ray collection and was a real disappointment. Here's hoping Marvel turns things around with Captain America and Thor.",1280361600,10,1885,4.424418604651163
3841112,4,B0021L8V1Q,"The first time out, the contracts are signed, the director and actors and script writers involved are all hungry to earn our favor - because everyone wins in a successful franchise. And this attitude contributes to the likelihood of a great first movie - like Iron Man. But once they have earned our favor, there's some pressure to live up to the original, but not much else. This is why sequels are so tricky.
The mature acting skills of Robert Downy, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow liven up an otherwise gaudy script which follows too many characters and complex plotlines. Samuel Jackson is great with power and rage roles - but he doesn't fit heroic or calm types, and his chemistry with Downy is almost nil. Don Cheadle is usually amazing (Traitor, Traffic), but in this movie his acting is stilted. Johannsen has about 10 lines, lots of hot body shots (no problem with THAT), and a single kick-butt action scene - and that's because the action scenes were crafted by cartoon action genius Genndy Tartakovsky (of Samurai Jack fame). Expect excitement and less compelling character exploration for Iron Man 2.",1280188800,2,1106,4.826315789473684
3841113,2,B0021L8V1Q,this movie without a doubt was a huge dissapointment. I heard a rumor before the movie even came out to theatres that it was suppose to be as good as a sequel like the the dark knight was to batman begins. That was a lie Iron man 2 starts out good showing what has progressed since the first movie and entices us with an awesome battle at a race track with whiplash but falls flat after that. The movie should have been called tony stark instead of iron man 2 because he was iron man about only 3 times or 4x in the movie. The first iron man is better and has moaction than the sequel which is ridiculous. But  the acting overall was good and scarlett johansen fight at the last 15 minutes in the movie was very well choregraphed and executed. A 2 star sequel could have been more but didn't accomplish what the film the dark knight directed by Christopher nolan did.,1280188800,5,867,4.254545454545455
3841114,1,B0021L8V1Q,"Oh hey, there'll be spoilers. Also, this has been heavily edited from the two paragraph blurb it once was. Now you know.

Iron Man. We saw in the first movie an arrogant, hedonistic, self-absorbed playboy brought low. We saw him build himself back up again into something greater. He was still self-absorbed, arrogant and hedonistic, but now he was less like someone they'd make a reality show after and more like James Bond. He's still going to chase the girl and have a good time doing his job, but he's still the guy who's going to save the world.

On top of that, we had an excellent cast, and they played to their strengths. Jeff Bridges was the most subdued, interesting villain I've seen in a long time. Gwyneth Paltrow played the smart, independent, savvy personal assistant who's not above knocking her boss down a peg when he needs it. Terrence Howard was fantastic as Rhodey. Even John Favreau, the director himself, was amusing as Happy the bodyguard in the scene he had.

Four writers crafted a character story in the guise of an action movie in the superhero genre that wouldn't be seen again until The Dark Knight.

SO WHAT HAPPENED?! Why did the second movie suck?!

Well, Robert Downey Jr. was so impressed with the movie Tropic Thunder that he brought the co-screen writer for that movie to write Iron Man 2. There are some wonderful one-person talents who can write science fiction adventure well (Nicholas Meyer from Star Trek 2 and 6 immediately comes to mind), but unfortunately this guy isn't one of them. And John Favreau, the director, seems to know nothing at all when it comes to directing action scenes; the weakest part of the first movie is the anti-climactic action scene near the end. This combination has led to a watered down movie, where too many things happen too quickly, there are entirely too many characters to focus on, the hype of the upcoming Avengers movie washes away the main story, the action is atrocious, and it's hard to sit through.

Iron Man 2. We finally have the back story out of the way. We finally can get to the action, crafted expertly into a story around Tony Stark becoming the alcoholic danger to himself and others he's known best for. We can finally see Rhodey don his own suit and take up the mantel while Tony puts himself back together...again. We can see Pepper Potts doing her thing, and Happy doing his. Mix it up with the occasional reminder of the Avengers Initiative and you have a movie as worthwhile as the first one. Maybe we'll get a Big Bad as great as Jeff Bridges. And maybe John Favreau will let someone else direct the action after all the criticism he got over the first movie.

We didn't get any of that, did we? We didn't get a great action movie, we got Science Comic Con. A convention? The movie centers around a science convention?! Did we stumble into a sitcom along the way to the theater by accident, because an action movie that costs tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to make shouldn't have the plot of a Simpsons episode.

In the Marvel universe, vibranium is kind of a naturally occurring alloy on Earth, and Tony Stark was a raving alcoholic. In the movie, Tony Stark only has a drinking problem on his birthdays and he's dying unless he invents vibranium. I know where this is going. Tony's dad first invented vibranium and created Captain America's shield with it, so we'll see that tie in for that movie. But in changing this up in the movie universe, we take away the one thing Tony Stark is sort of best known for: he is his own worst enemy. He doesn't have some great inner demon to fight in this movie like he did in the first one, he just has daddy issues that kind of show up when the plot requires.

What happened to the great characters in the first movie? Tony Stark is just annoying, Pepper Potts just dotes, Natasha (Black Widow in the comics) is just kind of there until she gets her action scene. The Avengers Initiative is talked about at a doughnut shop.

Mickey Rouke...remember in the trailers, we're promised what should be an epic game of cat and mouse, or some epic power struggle, between Tony Stark and Ivan Vanko? Ivan, who promises to tear down the good name of Stark? What happened to that? Suddenly he becomes a bit player in his own story? We're barely even introduced to Sam Rockwell's character, yet he gets more attention in the movie?

Sam Rockwell's character manages to be twice as annoying as Tony Stark. That's hard to watch.

Don Cheadle just looks bored through the whole movie. Terrence Howard was so much more enjoyable to watch. And how does this work? He's after the power suit but Tony doesn't want to give it to him. Tony says in the Senate hearing that he and his power suit are one; his chest piece powers the suit, after all. So how does Rhodey get the power suit to even work in the first place if there's nothing to power it? Because if Tony Stark just put an arc reactor in the suit yet meant to test Rhodey...the reasoning just falls apart.

All the elements were there to make a fantastic movie. We even see a lot of these elements get wasted. Tony Stark working to find out the history between his family and Ivan Vanko while he battles his alcoholism. Ivan Vanko setting out to destroy Tony Stark's reputation while he's up to his own scheme. Tony knowing he's having some serious issues, so he willingly gives Rhodey the suit (Rhodey personally of course, not the U.S. government). Rhodey having to become War Machine and learn he may be in over his head as a superhero. Natasha coming as a secret agent to keep tabs on Tony, bugging his house, stealing the plans for building the suit, reporting back to Nick Fury to see if he's ready to be an Avenger. Pepper Potts figuring out what's going on with Natasha and Nick Fury. Hopefully some great action in all the right places.

But no. We got crap. We got a bad movie, with a terrible story and talent terribly wasted. The first Iron Man was a great movie, one of the top superhero movies in spite of its flaws. Iron Man 2 is a thoughtless popcorn flick. It falls in line with Spider-man 3 as the most disappointing movie I've seen.",1280102400,12,6141,4.515751575157516

3841118,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Although Iron Man 2 didn't quite get up to the bar set by Iron Man I, I feel it was worth the price of theater tickets to see on the big screen and well worth investing in the DVD when it's finally released (this from somebody way too cheap to pay for theater tickets or cough up for most DVD's when we can borrow them free from our library).

The chemistry between Stark and Potts was as good if not better than before.  Potts character as an extremely classy, competent and pragmatic woman is built upon nicely and a positive role model for our daughters without needing to transform into a superhero herself.  Her grace and the chemistry between her and Stark (including his clumsy attempts to woo her) is the surprising reason so many -women- have been attracted to this movie.  No spoilers here, but towards the end you'll be like ""it's about time!!!""

Ivan Vanko was credible as the villian ... he's evil and you're glad to see him defeated, but you understand where he is coming from.  You'll feel sad at the end as though a beautiful but viscous dog is put down because he can't be rehabilitated.  I wish they'd emphasized a tiny bit more the process by which Vanko builds his competing ""suit"" and his relationship with his pet bird as sci-fi fans like the technical stuff while women enjoy relationships that help them understand people.  It helps if you understand Russian when Vanko speaks (though Rourkes' Russian isn't that good) because some of the comments Vanko mutters under his breath in Russian that the movie never bothers to translate are actually quite funny (such as when he mutters ""sleeshcum mnoga gavariche"" to Hammer which loosely translates into ""you talk too much."")

Some people have complained about the director writing himself into the script.  I didn't mind and loved when Black Widow slammed him to the floor in the boxer ring scene and also towards the end when Hogan's so pleased with himself for having defeated one security guard and then he looks around to see Black Widow has defeated a dozen more.

Black Widow was great ... another strong and classy woman to inspire my daughters.  Her exposure was just about right in this movie, but I hope they highlight her character (and her kick-butt martial arts skills) quite a bit more in the upcoming Avengers.

Don Cheadle was okay as Warmonger.  I liked Terrence Howard in IM1 and felt they wrote him out of the script too much when viewing the deleted scenes (to the point many things didn't make sense until viewing the deletions), so I was glad to see Cheadle fill in the details of the relationship between Stark and Rhodey in IM2.  However, since Cheadle is such a great actor, I was disappointed to see him take such a pronounced ""best buddy sidekick"" role.  Cheadle needs to be stronger as a superhero in his own right in Avengers and IM3.

The Hammer character just didn't work for me ... at all.  I like him as a stand-up comic, but one or two comic interjections into the characters weaseliness would have been plenty.  One slightly-warped-has-a-sense-of-humour weapons manufacturing billionaire industrialist is plenty ... two is one too many.  The wasted time spent injecting humour into his character would have been much better spent on Stark spending time improving the suit or solving his power problem.

As for Iron Man himself, he was great, but the producers focused too much on drunken incidents of Starks self-destructive behavior when he thinks he's dying and not enough on the tech-building aspect of Stark trying to solve his own problem.  Watching Robert Downey Jr. go through this same self-destructive process in real life was quite enough, thank you very much, and a good 20 minutes of IM2's drunken antics would have been better spent on other issues.  Like Downey in real life, the viewers want to see Stark move beyond his problems and become emotionally strong and self-disciplined like the actor who portrays him.  Watching Stark build and test the suit in IM1 (both gorgeous -and- brilliant) is what attracted many viewers to the first movie ... I feel they downplayed the tech too much (like where did the suitcase suit come from?) in IM2.  Stark in IM1 is ""everyman,"" the inspiration for intelligent people everywhere to simply -choose- to use your intellect to create a solution for unsolveable problems and, in the process, make yourself a better person.  Stark is a man who, quite literally, is dying from a broken heart but still has enough heart left to choose to make the world a better place.  The Marvel Iron Man/Stark character has always been about the humanity of the man inside the suit, not just the suit itself, some of which was lost in IM2 in their attempt to throw too many characters and sub-plots into the mix.

The whole get-drunk-at-the-party-destroy-the-house-fight-with-Rhody scene should have been completely deleted and that time devoted to more comic build-it-test-it-have-a-mishap-then-solve-it scenes like was done in the first movie.  Stark also had more ""emotional"" moments in IM1 (such as fear when he first sees the electromagnet in his chest or getting choked up when he tells Pepper he knows what he's doing is the right thing to do) which were totally missing in IM2 (like ... the dude is dying ... where's the emotion!!!)  One or two of the ""drunk"" scenes would have been better spent having Stark come to grips with his relationship with his genius dead father.

Another distasteful element ... the directors attempts to tie Stark to Howard Hughs by adopting his dislike of germs or people touching him is barking up the wrong tree.  We want a strong Iron Man, not a neurotic one.  Ditch the Hughs defect analogies and play up the similarities to of Howard Hughs strengths instead!!!  Nobody wants to think of Iron Man/Stark ending up in a Vegas hotel room surrounded by cups of his own urine like Hughs!!!

I sure hope Downey does a Russell Crowe and decides to ""keep the body"" when he does Sherlock Holmes 2 this time around!!!  It's none-too-hard on the female eyes watching Downey flex those gorgeous iron-hammering arms, six-pack abs and chest muscles (okay ... female leering here ... probably not relevant to a movie review).

Some action-hero buffs have complained about too much underlying ""talk"" and not enough action.  I don't think it was simply lack of action that lost this movie it's 5th star, but rather the fact it dragged too long between the first few action scenes than we had to wait to have them all lumped up at the end.  Not all movie viewers are 14-years old ... we like drama and a well defined thread underlying the action ... but IM2 just didn't do as good of a job as tying together the action and sub-scripts as IM1.  Too many ""chiefs"" (actors and sub-plots) and not enough ""firemen"" (testing the suit) to do the work in this movie.  I hope they clean things up for Avengers and IM3.

In summary ... not as good as IM1, but still worth buying the DVD and watching it a million times even if you're cheap like me.",1278892800,2,7003,4.739488870568837
3841119,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Robert Downey, Jr. dons red armor once again as Tony Stark in this second go-round for Iron Man.  With all of the primary cast returning except for Terence Howard (replaced by Don Cheadle), this sequel opens with Stark living up his superhero life and enjoying the relative world peace that his armor's strength has brought to the planet.  In the public's eye, he uses smart aleck remarks and blistering evidence to fend off the demands of the U.S. government to obtain the technology he used to create his armor.  The government believes that other countries might soon have the same technology and weaponry that Stark created, but Stark insists that enemies are years away from developing such things.  He also brushes off his biggest rival in the weapons market, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), in exceedingly embarassing ways.  Privately, however, the technology that saved him in the first film is slowly killing him now.

With his death in sight and no remedy in the foreseeable future, Stark hits the bottle hard, parties it up, and pretty much alienates himself from the woman who cares for him, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his best friend, Rhodey (Cheadle).  S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his ever present co-worker, Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), are also disturbed by Stark's behavior and keep a very close eye on him.

Stark appoints Potts as CEO of Stark Industries knowing that she'll be able to maintain the company after he is gone.  He also picks up a new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) to do little more than damage control.

Stark begins to take huge risks with his life, including racing in Monaco.  It is here that he first confronts Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a vengeful man who blames Stark's father for the demise of his own father.  Little does Tony know that Vanko not only understands and can utilize the arc reactor technology, but has made what seems to be a better version of it.

Soon enough, Vanko joins forces with Justin Hammer and the duo set out to destroy Tony Stark.  Who wins in the end?  Watch ""Iron Man 2"" in order to find out.

I loved the first ""Iron Man"" film.  I believe part of the reason I enjoyed it so much was that I really didn't expect it to be such a great film.  As far as comic book films go, it is one of, if not the best, that's come along in a long time.  In the first film, greed and a hunger for power drove Obadiah Stain to want to put an end to Tony Stark.  In the sequel, all Vanko wants to do is destroy Tony Stark in an act of vengeance.  It's a more sinister motive in my opinion.  Granted, Hammer is jealous of Stark and wants his fortune and fame, but he is merely a tool used by Vanko in order to exact his revenge.

Pepper Potts takes on a much larger role in this film, attempting to keep Stark from destroying himself and trying to maintain some level of respect for the Stark Industries name.  Rhodey is affected in a similar way, struggling with himself on where his loyalties lie with his friend and his country.

Stark's tailspin into oblivion is disturbing to watch on the screen.  He does an excellent job of showing how a man who seemingly has it all can quickly destroy himself.  With that said, Downey also delivers some of the funniest lines in the film, and Rockwell is usually on the receiving end.  The two actors play well against each other and I'd love to see them spar in another film soon.

Johansson does a wonderful job in her role as Rushman.  I especially enjoyed her interaction with Jon Favreau, who reprises his role as Happy Hogan.  Paul Bettany returns as the voice of JARVIS, as well as Leslie Bibb in a brief stint as reporter Christine Everhart.

Overall, the film is very good.  It's not quite up to par with ""Iron Man,"" but I really didn't expect it to match its predecessor.  At times it felt a bit rushed and there is a brief lag in the film while Stark is trying to get himself back together.  Still, I highly recommend this film.  It brings us one step closer to the heavily anticipated ""Avengers"" film, and sets the table for the upcoming ""Thor"" film next year.  Be sure to watch for a certain Captain's shield to make a swift and funny appearance, a glimpse of a certain green guy's destruction, and a nod to a particularly thunderous hero after the credits roll.",1278374400,,4318,4.546632124352332
3841120,4,B0021L8V1Q,"The first Iron Man film still stands as the best pure superhero movie in my mind. It was like a perfect storm of awesome visuals, great cast, new and old takes on various aspects of the source material, and popcorn fun. Every single aspect of that film just struck me as exactly right. Was I looking forward to the sequel? Don't ask stupid questions. So how does the sequel fare? Read the review title, genius.  Alright, I'm sorry. I'm in a bit of a bad mood because I expected much more than I got. But here's the thing: I actually loved Iron Man 2 on some levels. But I have to face the fact that this movie was only saved by probably the most phenomenal cast I've ever seen onscreen. A well put-together film does not rely entirely on the performances of the cast, but is merely enhanced by them. Aside from the witty dialogue, too much of this production simply did not click. World peace? From one dude in a suit? How? Why? Let's see a movie about that! The likes of Celestial Being and Captain Nemo couldn't do it and their stories are pretty involved. How'd this happen? You expect the audience to buy that the world laid down their arms in response to the appearance of one superhero? Garbage. There is shockingly little action for a sequel to the brilliant origin story of the first film. The sequel's primary draw is the comedy. Most of it is excellent, but some of it is flat-out cheesy because they simply put too much of it out there. Did anybody want to see Tony Stark stumbling drunkenly around in full armor at his birthday party? Did we really want to wait until the final act to see a serious action set piece? Is it too much to ask that Rhodey have a better part to play and his relationship with Tony re-established along the way considering there's a new actor in the role? And for the love of God, I do not EVER want to see Bill O'Reilly's mug on the big screen ever again. Favreau, I'm putting you on notice. You made me throw up in my mouth a little with that one.

 The whole production of Iron Man 2 felt unpolished and thrown-together. It BARELY squeaks by as a worthy follow-up because it still kicks the snot out of Spider-Man 3.  Okay, I've ranted and raged about what's wrong with Iron Man 2. What's right? The cast, the cast, THE CAST! Robert Downey Jr is still brilliant as expected. Gwyneth Paltrow's endearingly flustered Pepper Potts is still strong as expected. So what else is new, right? Well, Mickey Rourke. Wow. I was not expecting that amount of coolness from the villain in this one. Rourke plays Ivan Vanko (aka Whiplash) like a Russian Danny Trejo. Covered in tats and scars, grinning sardonically, toothpick hanging out of his mouth, killer accent, and laid back as hell. This man just great to watch. He seems to have popped right out of a Tarantino flick. His benefactor is the compulsively-punchable Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a professional rival of Tony Stark and one cheesy bastard. The guy's mannerisms are so naturally geeky I almost want to cheer for him. But he's such a corny d-bag, I'd rather see him get kicked in the nuts. Either way, a fun little punching bag for the proceedings. I wanted a bigger role for the unnaturally beautiful Scarlett Johansson, but her Black Widow is primarily relegated to eye candy until the final act. Thankfully, I've never seen a more gorgeous character onscreen so the role works on that level. But would it have killed her to put on a hot accent? Natasha Romanov should have a Russian accent as a general rule. Does Samuel L Jackson need an introduction as Nick Fury (psst...he's really just playing himself as usual). All of this goodness kind of leaves Don Cheadle the odd man out, but it's alright. With all the impressive performances onboard there was no way for James Rhodes to stand out from this cast. That is, until he finally gets to rock The War Machine to the utmost. This takes too long to happen. Stupid, crappy pacing.

Is that the longest I've ever raved about a cast? I think it is. Well, when we finally get the big action throwdown we've been waiting for it's awesome, but it's over fast. I guess they didn't want to pay ILM any overtime. Boo. But the dialogue and the actors are so strong that these things are surprisingly easy to overlook. I seriously wonder how much of that stuff was improvised because it just seems so completely natural it's hard to believe it was written and performed. That is the highest praise, really. The soundtrack drops plenty of Clash on you along with some James Brown, Queen, Tupac, and of course AC/DC. One could do worse. Not in love with the end credits though. Oh, and if thee hath plans on leaving before the credits are through, I say thee nay! Marvel's got something for you. Seeds are sewn for the upcoming Avengers film along the way including a special part for a certain star-spangled deflection device that the frame-by-framers spotted in the background of the first film. Well played, Mr. Faveau. Well played. The thin story may have been better if it had focused more on Stark working with SHIELD as an anti-terrorism agent and utilized Black Widow as more of a double agent whose allegiance is in doubt. Would have been much more Marvel, much less Hollywood, more action-packed, and even potentially socially relevant. Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

 Iron Man 2 clearly fails to live up to the credentials of it's flawless predecessor. In fact, it's almost like a really lengthy and really cool commercial for Marvel's next projects. I expected much, much better from the man who made my favorite superhero movie ever but what I got was better than acceptable all things considered. I didn't leave the theater angry and aside from being assaulted by a raving FOX News lunatic bad-mouthing Miss Potts, nothing about this sequel really made me want to rip the director a new one. If you weren't thrilled by the first film, I wouldn't rush out to by this blind; and to the rest, keep your expectations in check and you should emerge relatively unscathed if not impressed.

Surely by now it's no surprise to moviegoers the world over, that sequels almost never live up to the original. Iron Man 2 is no exception to this unfortunate cinematic veracity. However, no attempt to do a justice could have been better; Iron Man 2 is almost as good as Iron Man.

Robert Downey Jr. reprises his sensational persona of billionaire Tony Stark. After revealing his identity as the man of Iron to the entire world at the first film's close, Stark's ego has naturally skyrocketed through the roof when we catch back up with him here.

The plot centers on Stark facing three major conflicts and several smaller ones. The two initially of upmost concern, are that, A: the reactor in his chest keeping him alive is also killing him, and B: the government is threatening to seize control of his Iron Man suit, which would realistically be the case were one to possess such an invention in reality.

Additional conflicts include Tony balancing feelings he has for his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) with their working relationship, an ego trip between him and his best friend `Rhodey' (Don Cheadle), and if all this wasn't enough to deal with - eventually Stark finds himself squaring off with not one, but two villains who begin working together.

The scumbags are played flawlessly by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell; both truly gifted actors - and big action summer flick or not - Iron Man 2 showcases their talents repeatedly. Their characters are vastly different but yet compliment one another well dramatically.

Rourke plays Ivan Vanko, a Russian terrorist hell-bent on revenge against Tony motivated by a personal vendetta. Rockwell plays a sleazy arms dealer named Hammer, who always seems to be technologically half a step or more behind Stark Industries. Vanko is sinister and macho and Hammer is hilarious and flamboyant; a great combo. I wish Vanko had a bigger role in the story.

I was relieved to see Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard as `Rhodey'. I can't say who is a better actor between the two - but Howard isn't as likeable as a buddy character as Cheadle is. Howard is more convincing as a villain or someone with a darker edge; see Big Mamma's House, Hustle and Flow and Crash.

The only real problem I had with the movie, takes place on a racetrack. It starts out really nicely - Rourke's character Vanko dons two powerful electrically charged whips that can cut cars in half, which was awesome (but of course they can't cut the Iron Man suit in half, because then we wouldn't have a movie now would we?).

The part of this I couldn't digest, lies in Vanko being able to take several blows to the torso from a vehicle repeatedly slamming him up against a fence; from which he leaves with only so much as a torn pant leg... no death, no internal bleeding, and he walks fine for the remainder of the film, and none of the other characters ever utter a word about this unbelievable miracle. But hey - at least everything else is for the most part plausible, and everyone in the audience seemed not to notice this either, so maybe I'm just nitpicking.

The film also doesn't have quite the same charisma the first one had and I suspect this stems from the change in screenwriters. This picture focuses more on the comedy, which is understandable as it was written by Justin Theroux who also wrote the crack-up Tropic Thunder. As in that movie, the humor of Iron Man 2 is hysterical, but at least for me, it softened the seriousness and overall merit of the film in a few scenes.

We do get a lot more action this time around though, and it is much appreciated. Lots of Shoot `em up scenes and Scarlett Johansson, who plays Stark's new employee Natalie, will drop your jaw with her martial arts skills. I've heard she spent several months training, and it really paid off. And my God, was the sound incredible in the theater when Stark would take off via his jet fueled suit. The vibrations were so intense; it literally felt like you were right there with him.

I have heard so many gripes from fans that felt director John Favreau gave himself too much screen time in this one. I loved Favreau's performance and I hope he's in even more scenes in Iron Man 3. I'll take it a step further and add on a request that my man Favreau put his pal Vince Vaughn in a cameo in the third installment as well. Who wouldn't enjoy seeing a witty verbal standoff between Tony Stark and Vince Vaughn?",1276732800,,4837,4.652989449003517

In the end, not what i expected. though special effects were great (in the few parts they were used) action scenes were few and far between. watch the trailer for this movie about 5 times and thats more action than this movie had. the final battle between ironman and lightning whip (a man who laughed at the thought of ironman the entire movie) lasted no more than 2 minutes. the bar fight between Downey and Cheadle was longer than that.

3841124,5,B0021L8V1Q,"From my wife Sarah: I don't really get any of the reviews saying that this movie is boring or indulgent. From the start to the finish we were completely entertained. When the movie ended, the audience applauded, so I know we were not the only ones to feel this way.

This movie has it all. Great action, fantastic special effects, well developed multi-faceted characters that you really care about, some romance, a well written script with depth and a great story, and outstanding acting.

Once again, Robert Downey Jr. plays a brilliant but troubled (though evolving) man who's life has become devoted to protecting peace. At the same time he struggles with his personal demons, and in this sequel he grapples with a life threatening illness. This actor is amazingly natural, completely believable and very entertaining. I love that his character is so intelligent and must use his mind to work through everything. It's also fascinating to watch his character heal from the hurts and relationship issues in his life. This wasn't just some mindless superhero movie (not that those are bad, but this was just different and yes, maybe a little better). It was a layered, well done story.

What an incredible supporting cast! Mickey Rourke was great as the villain. I can't put my finger on it, but he made the role fascinating as he did in the Wrestler. Gwyneth Paltrow was wonderful, beautiful and believable. I was really surprised by Scarlett Johansson. She's incredibly versitile. I don't want to give anything away by saying too much, but she was amazing. Don Cheadle brought sensitivity and strength to his role, and Sam Rockwell and Samual Jackson are always great.

In conclusion - I strongly recommend this movie! It's totally worth the time and money.",1275609600,,1759,4.9324324324324325
3841125,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man 2 is a huge step down from the first movie. To be fair, it is still pretty entertaining, but in many ways it is like The Incredible Hulk, except it goes in the opposite direction. Where that movie improved on Hulk in many ways(mainly by embracing the Marvel Universe), this film ends up being of comparable quality, but by comparison to the first film it is a huge let down.

Actually, in a lot of ways it's a huge let down. There really isn't a conflict to speak of, outside of a few plot contrivances. Tony Stark is dying. Except he's not really dying, as it seems everyone and their brother has a way to fix his problem. Tony Stark has some corporate rivals. Except they're jokes, never really threatening in any way. Tony Stark has someone who has a grudge against him, someone's who might be as brilliant as Tony in a darker way. Except their confrontations are both resolved in anticlimactic moments of action. Moments, at best.

The whole problem with the film is that it is all tell and no show. Tony Stark famously says that he has privatized world peace. Except we never see anything close to him actually doing that. In the first film we got a tease of Iron Man fighting warlords and terrorists. Here, we get magazine covers and people talking about vague accomplishments of Iron Man, saying that he's ""on watch,"" but we never see any of it. Then Tony has a breakdown later in the film, a drunken brawl with his friend. Nick Fury shows up and says he's been neglecting his duty and causing messes for Fury to clean up. Except, again, we see no neglect, we see no mess.

All in all, there are only really 2 action sequences in the entire film. The first, the famous racecar showdown, is great. Legitimately great. Until it becomes a joke where John Faverau makes himself the big hero. The second big sequence is decent, but it is overly dark, and when it's time to be over it's just over. Iron Man whips out a couple of super weapons and ends the battle in seconds.

All in all, the problem, to my mind, seems that Faverau wanted to just let the characters riff on each other, eating up screen time cheaply and spending his money on really big but not very exciting action sequences.

That said, there are the elements of a great film here. All the returning actors are great(except Faverau himself, who is just a series of bad jokes in a part that is inexplicably prominent), and Rockwell and Rourke are fantastic as the new villains. Rockwell is hilariously smarmy and annoying, playing an arms dealer who wants to be unscrupulous and underground, but isn't really up to being as threatening or evil as he wants to be. Rourke brings a nice quiet intelligence and menace to his role, playing well off of Rockwell and Downey. I'm actually quite glad that Faverau isn't that involved in The Avengers, as this movie just seems like an exercise in filmmaking excess. And not even the good kind of excess, that involves over-blown action sequences.",1275609600,2,2963,4.5411985018726595
3841126,4,B0021L8V1Q,"In this sequel , Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is up against an ingenious Russian (Mickey Rourke) that wants revenge on the Stark family for having his father deported from America. While a rich weapons manufacturer (Sam Rockwell) wants to use Rourke to build him Iron Man suits since Stark won't give his up to the government. While Stark has to find a new energy source that can keep him alive and isn't too confident that he can. But Stark's military friend (Don Cheadle) is more than ready to step in his shoes with the War Machine outfit.

  The movie is as slow as the first to pick up and give us some action. The first is a little better though since it doesn't take as long to give us some action. Plus some viewers might find the end fight to be too short and not even as good as the end fight of the first film. Still, I wouldn't call Iron Man 2 a disappointment, the movie is far better than a lot of the summer movies that came out last summer, like Transformers 2. Transformers 2 had a lot more action, but it was too loud and un-involving.

  When I watching the first Iron Man yesterday, I realized that Stark should have at least looked more in pain and weak after the operation that removed half his chest. I mean his body took too it too well I thought. So what I really liked about Iron Man 2 is that his body is starting to have a negative reaction to what saved his life in the first film. It was also nice to see more comic book characters in this sequel like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Whiplash (Mickey Rourke).",1275523200,,1576,4.28956228956229

3841128,4,B0021L8V1Q,"The best asset of a superhero franchise is when any installment lacks hubris:  either from its hero or from those who design it.  When a superhero is thrust in such peril that the outcome is in question, and the usual assumption that the good guy always wins has to be drawn back to consciousness, you know the creators have assembled a great movie.

All the parts are intact:  The trajectory is fun; the enemy is menacing; the dialog is witty and clever; and the story is cogent and clear--easy enough to understand, but detailed enough to be stimulating without overloading our efforts to suspend disbelief.

This time Iron Man [aka Tony Stark] (Downey Jr.) faces off with a Congressional committeeman, headed by Senator Stern (Chandling) who challenges his personal armored technology as dangerous and capable of escalating the arms race when brought to the wrong hands.  Stark's snappy answers win the day, but his lack of concessions bring a headlong, prideful fall that sends him unraveling.

The Senator's witness, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)[another arms' dealer] doesn't take his defeat in stride.  While showing off his prowess at auto race in Monaco, Stark faces his biggest challenge when an equally disgruntled Russian nemesis, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) unveils his electrifying half-man, half-human hybrid imitation.  From there Hammer builds an alliance with Vanko that makes inroads into the U.S. military, including with Stark's closest ally, Lt. Col James Rhodey (Cheadle).

Of course the trajectory of the movie doesn't work without the fun.  A celebrated Iron Man must be chastened by all his handlers, including Pwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, his still wise-cracking assistant.  New to the fray is Scarlett Johansson in a refreshing, make-over role as the attractive and lethal duo identity Natalie/Natasha.  And while Stark's adolescent tendencies are not towed in line by both leading femme fatales, Cheadle and Jackson give able support.

This adventure does go to the edge of danger, but not enough to fully pay dirt.  In some ways this isn't a five-star film for what I first thought were intangibles.  My first inclination was to dock the movie for its overlong half-time exposition, but that's not really fair.  An adventure movie that takes time out to think shouldn't be diminished, particularly when it delivers on the intelligence.  It also helps that Iron Man has some health/toxicity issues, thickening the plot, even if it is a dropped opportunity to provide more tension.

The freshness and fun are just as apparent; it just comes down to the one factor I started out with at the beginning:  Do you have to stop and wonder (while you're clinging to someone's hand [or your chair] and sitting at the edge of your seat) how this guy is going to get out of all the mess?  What this sequel has going for it will propel it to at least two more sequels, but to have the cliffhanger feel of a sequel, like, say, 'Spider Man 2' is a bit of a stretch.",1275264000,17,2982,4.935871743486974

3841132,5,B0021L8V1Q,"When I was a young boy I played with all sorts of action figures, GI Joes and Transformers the most.  Later as a young teen I got my first job at a comic book store.  What I often thought of was a collaboration of my favorites.  As Hollywood has slowly embraced a genre specifically steered towards the Comic-Con crowd I have looked on with great interest.  Having loved the original Iron Man, I can say unequivocally that Iron Man 2 is awesome in every way.

The sequel deals quite a bit with the palladium and arc reactor technology behind Iron Man, and how that technology adversely affects Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.).  As the U.S. government, via LTC James Rhodes (Cheadle) demands access to the design, use, and replication of Iron Man's scientific advancements - something Stark refuses - the man behind the mask must face not only his government and his mortality, but also a competing industrialist, the nefarious Justin Hammer (Rockwell), and the Russian villain Ivan ""Whiplash"" Vanko (Rourke), who has reverse engineered Iron Man's arc reactor technology (adding weapons along the way) to satisfy a family vendetta.  On top of all that Stark still has to be the hard-partying, scotch-pounding womanizer who must placate Pepper Potts (Paltrow) on a daily basis, ogle new assistant Natasha Romanoff (Johansson), and contemplate an affiliation with SHIELD - a top secret government organization led by front-man Nick Fury (Jackson).

Some may say this movie fails because it lacks action.  And by ""lacks action"" most people mean ""isn't Transformers 2.""  In my opinion, the more detailed storyline uncovering Stark's personal, psychological, and physical dilemmas is the essence of the flawed superhero, and avoiding the zeitgeist makes is superior to the bam, pow FX-heavy of Transformers 2, et al.  But when Iron Man 2 DID ratchet up the action - initially with a battle between Iron Man and Rhodes, but later in an epic Iron Man robot battle royal - it was edge the seat, floor rumbling, front row of the rollercoaster exciting.

It should go without saying, but the incredible cast performs just as one would expect.  Downey, Jr. is the boisterous, swaggering Tony Stark personified, and Paltrow, whose smug attitude I typically loathe, is nearly perfect as Potts.  Rockwell and Jackson turn in inspired, albeit secondary efforts.  Johannson is minimally used, but serves her Matrix-esque purpose in a skin-tight outfit and awesome fight scene.  The scene stealer, however, is clearly Mickey Rourke.  The demented, evil look, the spot-on accent, the eccentricity is electric (pun intended).

Great movie, succeeds where others have failed, builds upon the story perfectly, provides something for all audiences, and for me, it put the GI Joe into a Transformer costume.",1274227200,7,2776,5.103982300884955
3841133,2,B0021L8V1Q,"The gilded surface is worn through and the glint no longer shimmers, but what ""Iron Man 2"" lacks in fun it makes up for with pathos. Like many a darker second chapter in the journey of a super-hero, the true villains would surface as those that dwelled within. Superman, Luke Skywalker, and Spiderman all had to fight with who they were, although to be fair, Peter Parker always seemed to run away in any movie regardless.

The same holds true for Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who despite facing the triple threat of a passionate senator (Gary Shandling), a fellow industrialist (Sam Rockwell), and a vengeful Russian hacker and possible lion tamer (Mickey Rourke), the biggest danger still lies within the man in the iron suit. After all, it grows increasingly hard to believe that they could pose Stark any more danger than he already does to himself as we watch as Stark happily dishes out massive amounts of damage to his own home in a self-destructive downward spiral in a moment that feels all too awkwardly autobiographical by Downey, playing a man coping with the excesses of fame.

Which is an integral point that the movie revolves around: Where does a superhero story go after the man of steel outs himself to the world? None of the other superheroes had this problem, and while they're all too busy hiding their identity from the world, Iron Man busies himself protecting his right to save it. It is an interesting and a radical departure from the traditional mould, but one that ultimately is let down by the script, written by newcomer and actor Justin Theroux, who unfortunately is neither able to do justice to such a bold idea, nor to measure up to his predecessors.

 And this is where the movie suffers the most. Where the first entry was fun, exciting, and more importantly, fresh, this sequel simply lumbers heavily from action set piece to action set piece, with none of the wit, cohesiveness, or direction that made the first so endearing. While the actors all give it their best, they are all ultimately let down by a disappointing script that gives characters a lot to do, yet nothing to do.

Visually, the film cannot be faulted. Directed once again by Jon Favreau, it does have the advantage of being a refreshing take on an otherwise tired genre, but even despite Favreau's best efforts as he once again successfully delivers a different vibe, he can do little as the writing ultimately lets down the picture.

 Rourke, as the central villain, has a little more than a cameo in ""Iron Man 2"", where he seems to be in a completely different movie. A Dostoyevsky tragedy perhaps, which makes his standoffs with Stark all the more jarring. Likewise, Scarlett Johansson has a brief role that really contributes little except to help tie this movie into a future `superhero team' movie. More fitting though is Rockwell's performance, as he plays industrialist Justin Hammer as both the shadowy reflection of, and a man deeply in live with the idea of Tony Stark.

 Perhaps therein lays the tragedy of this sequel. It tries too hard to be like its predecessor, to give audiences a familiar sight through different lenses again, but unfortunately glosses over what made ""Iron Man"" work. No amount of exploding robots or martial artistry can make up for true purpose in a story, which is what this sequel lacks.

Still, ""Iron Man 2"" gets the job done. Perhaps not as effectively, but sufficiently, with more than a few screws left over.",1274227200,5,3458,4.7675585284280935

Sharply directed once again by actor Jon Favreau and shrewdly written by another actor, Justin Theroux, the 2010 blockbuster is as much an actors' showcase as it is a special effects-saturated comic book adventure. This precarious balance is what made the first film so ideal, and while the surprise element has been replaced in part by a breezy familiarity in the sequel, the result is still far more entertaining than most in its genre. This is despite the fact that the movie is overpopulated with colorful characters, most worthy of a film of their own.

Overkill is a common problem in heavily invested Hollywood studio product like this, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As hedonistic billionaire Tony Stark, the actor has to face off with no less than three villains, two other figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in distress depending on the plot machinations. The story picks up Stark six months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life.

Meanwhile, taciturn, cockatoo-loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is plotting revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit, while U.S. Senator Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's excessively destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is introduced in an ambivalent manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time. It all comes to a head at the expo where Vanko and Hammer have colluded to produce an aerial battle royale.

That's a whole lot of plot to fit into a 124-minute movie, but at least the momentum never flags. The problem for comic fanboys may well be the dearth of action sequences. The showdowns between Stark and Vanko create the necessary tension although the build-ups are rather predictable, and the climactic battle sequence feels more like a swirling meteor shower since it takes place at night. Still, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and art director J. Michael Riva do first-rate work here with the production details. Moreover, the actors do their best even if their characters are given short shrift in the screenplay. Mickey Rourke relies on his own uncomfortably maniacal screen persona and idiosyncratic touches to embody Vanko's two-dimensional motives, while Sam Rockwell is even more cartoonish with a petulant, hammy albeit amusing turn as Hammer.

Replacing Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle does what he can as the put-upon best friend and archetypal soldier, but Rhodey has to represent the film's most thankless role. A surprisingly cast Garry Shandling brings a nice edge to the avuncular senator, and Favreau himself repeats his role as Stark's loyal chauffeur Happy Hogan. No fool as a director, he gets to face off to primarily comic effect with Scarlett Johansson, properly feline and physically adroit in her black catsuit, as Natalie.

As Pepper, Gwyneth Paltrow gets more to do this time around, bantering with Downey with Nick-and-Nora-level lan, but the character is near-impossible to believe. Fans, however, will have no problem loving and believing in the sequel, but the pervasive one-liners and the wild zigzags between hubris and insecurity make a strong case to redub the hero Irony Man.",1274227200,,4939,5.520475561426684
3841135,4,B0021L8V1Q,"After a spectacular start with Iron Man a couple summers ago, one would have hoped for an even better sequel, considering the fortunes of the Spiderman, X Men, and Batman franchises of late, whose sophomore efforts took their series to dizzying new heights.  Not so here, although Iron Man 2 is definitely not a step down either.  Consider it on par with the original film and as such, a pretty entertaining, well made Marvel Comics screen entry, and it boasts another strong performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the hero.

Picking up where industrialist genius, Tony Stark, reveals himself to be Iron Man, the folks in Washington D.C., namely the military and Congress want the technology.  He defies the Senate panel by declaring the armor as private property that has brought world peace.  Stark's competitor, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is desperate to claim the military's approval for armored weaponry.  Stark's main girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is trying to help him run Stark Enterprises despite Tony's childish antics and thrill seeking.  His buddy, Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle taking over for Terrence Howard), is under pressure by the military to get the Iron Man technology.  A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson), has a mysterious background.  All this as Starks' blood is beginning to get poisoned by his ebbing, artificial heart.

Enter the Russian, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father was snubbed by Stark's dad.  He has developed a body armor that has electric whips, while Hammer provides him the resources to exact revenge.  Stark must come to terms with the distant relationship with his late father as he desperately searches for an answer to his failing heart.  As Hammer presents his new military hardware to an audience, Ivan and Tony engage in a battle royal.

What the filmmakers needed to do (and could have done a bit more) was to let Downey carry the film on his shoulders; he's certainly earned the right to flex his acting muscles after Iron Man.  Here, he shows off his flair for being a bad boy whose arrogance is matched by his tech savvy, and he is a hero confronting his inner demons and pain which are directly related to the fallout with his father.  It is interesting how poppa Stark is portrayed in newsreel footage as a kind of Industrial version of Walt Disney complete with a topographic industrial plan instead of a theme park.

Downey and Paltrow have good repartee and a smooth chemistry even when they argue.  The dialogue is snappy and at times funny courtesy of screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) and director Jon Favreau who still knows how to convey the fantasy world of super heroes, and there are enough twists and surprises to keep things humming along.

Rourke is sufficiently menacing as Ivan, spouting Russian and a dark, defiant persona.  Samuel Jackson repeats as Nick Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., a secret organization that is attempting to assemble `The Avengers Initiative'.  Johansson is on screen too briefly but there is a nice payoff where she comes through in fine form, or should I say fighting form.  As a US Senator, comedian Garry Shandling is stunt casting but proves a bit of a distraction; you just can't take his character seriously.  Marvel co-creator Stan Lee makes another brief cameo, and Favreau is amusing in a larger supporting role of Happy Hogan.

Special effects are impressive and ably serve the story.  That suit of armor still wows and functions in true comic book form.  There is a familiar, circular prop that appears in a crucial scene that Marvel fans will want to note!  Stunt work and the fight choreography that involves Johansson's character is fun to watch but you wish there were more.

Favreau has shown a knack for comic heroes, but he has not made the big step to improve on his franchise.  Perhaps in Iron Man 3 he can break the curse that has plagued super hero franchises that fell down in their third films.  By the way, do stay after the credits for an interesting clip that hints at the ever growing Marvel Universe.",1274054400,,4071,4.866473149492017
3841136,4,B0021L8V1Q,"[THIS IS BEING WRITTEN AT THE TIME OF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE -- AS OF THIS WRITING, THE DVD IS NOT OUT YET, THANKS.]

Unlike other superhero films, with shoot 'em up action, crazed villains and a conflicted hero who is put into life threatening situations for himself and those he loves, director Favreau decided on a different take.

Favreau went on an Iron-Deficient diet!  And instead created a story about Tony the man.  Tony the billionaire, arrogant playboy.  Tony, the man who is dying.

The Paramount logo barely glows on the big screen when we hear the audio of the Senate hearings by a smarmy senator who demands the Iron suit ""weapon"" for the USA.  Tony wants it for himself and congratulates himself on ""privatizing World Peace"" *kiss kiss*

However, the metal he is using for the energy core that is keeping him alive as well as powering the Iron suit is killing him.  CGI veins darken his neck.  But in a fit of wanting to protect those he loves by pushing them away, he gives away his art gallery, gives his CEO post to Pepper Potts and decides to party his life away.

The world however ,was not meant to give Stark a relaxing good time.

The other side of the world has a Russian physicist whose father worked for and later apparently discarded by Tony's father.  This man, Ivan, wants revenge.  Collaborating with a government stooge (Justin Hammer, a real idiot) he invents Iron-man clones which as we will later see will be used to bring down Stark Industries (known colloquially as ""Hammer-oids"").  Hey, I could NOT make this stuff up, OK??

I disagree with critics who feel it's another Spider-man 3&nbsp;] with a bunch of villains and mixing it up.  Far from it.

The ""women of steel"" include Black Widow, working under cover for SHIELD as Tony's legal adviser (and man she is fine) and a great martial artist.  Love the fight scenes!  The other ""woman of steel"" is Pepper Potts, who is at her wits end about what to do about and with Tony.  She loves him but she can't stand him.  Whadda predicaminckt!

The real player is Tony's dad.  We watch a film that would have done Disney proud as the ""Key to the Future"" is revealed (complete with Disney-esque music and style) but is actually more than it seems -- and gives Tony a key to his future.

The relationship angle was a welcome change for the superhero film.  It's mostly story and plot and interaction between characters.  Yes, there are explosions and broken glass and flying bullets and guns -- but these are secondary -- even the villain is secondary -- to the man and the myth that is Stark.

I was impressed!

Minus one star for the slow pace.  I found that it went on a little too long, with Tony getting drunk, smashing up his own birthday party and so on.  The Shield connection and Black Widow's part could have been expanded in lieu of the silly party antics.

Don't forget to stay to the end of the credits!  There's a cool chestnut for you Marvel Comics fans!

Bottom Line:  Character driven, real story and substance into the man that is Tony Stark, as he finds his body betraying him, as he is slowly dying and does not have a lot of options.  People who don't normally go in for these types of comic book-based films will enjoy this picture as a result of this new, original style by Favreau.

3841137,2,B0021L8V1Q,"WOW! What happened here!?  After such a surprise smash of an original, how could this sequel come off so . . . well, boring?

I admit, at first I found the slower pace refreshing.  After all, isn't that the direction every other sequel takes?  Bigger, louder, faster, less plot?  So when the film opened with about twenty or thirty minutes of talk revolving around Tony Stark's insistence he's got ""peace privatized"" while a senate subcommittee isn't so sure, I was actually interested.  When we saw that Stark was being poisoned by the very tech that was keeping him alive (as Jarvis so conveniently spells out for us slow viewers), again, intriguing . . .

Here's the problem - this stuff is supposed to be the setup, NOT the ENTIRE MOVIE!  Yes, at the 90 minute mark (literally, I checked my watch) when Stark was STILL dealing with these same issues, I was no longer pleased with the slow pace - I was BEGGING the movie to start doing something interesting!  Minus the ""race track"" sequence (most of which you've already seen in the trailer) the first half of the film has zero Iron Man action (unless you count a drunken brawl between Stark and Rhodey - a glorified barfight).

By the time the woefully underused Mickey Rourke FINALLY unleashes his devious plot to assault Ironman with a batch of robots, the film has a mere 20 minutes left to go - and the ensuing climatic battle feels like what it is - a perfunctory, tacked on conclusion - seemingly included only because the filmmakers begrudgingly admit they are, in fact, making an action movie, and not a dramatic comedy.  As such, the final showdown between Ironman and Whiplash takes up all of about two minutes, and then the movie sprints for its closing credits.

Also wasted as the lovely Scarlett Johansson, who has, as I suggested in my title, the films only truly enjoyable sequence as she does her Matrix-Infused-Latex-Dominatrix best in taking down a squad of security cops.  When a redhead girl's stunt-double brings more excitement to your movie than the titular Iron-clad hero, there is a SERIOUS problem!

I think I understand what the problem is - the makers of the first film analyzed the reaction, saw that Robert Downey, Jr. got most of the praise for that film, and decided to build the sequel NOT around bigger and better action, but instead around twice as many opportunities for Downey to quip and mug and annoy other characters.  In fact, not only do they give us double the Downey, but they also introduce a rival arms dealer (Sam Rockwell) to do the exact same act, only for evil instead of good.

All this means that if you enjoy Downey and Rockwell (who are both great at what they do) and don't mind a film built on their overindulgence, then you might like this sequel.  But if you go in expecting a bigger, badder Iron Man, don't . . . this is one of the first sequels I've ever seen that delivers LESS action than its predecessor.

As others have suggested, at the end of the day, this film is essentially more a promotion for the supposedly upcoming AVENGERS movie - a film that is constantly being talked about and promised for some as yet unannounced future date.  If the further proposed films that are supposed to lead up to AVENGERS are as dull as this one, that day may never come.",1273881600,77,3281,4.5969125214408235
3841138,4,B0021L8V1Q,"You know you have an all star cast when Samuel L. Jackson plays a bit role.  Is there anyone out there looking forward to ""The Avengers"" movie in 2012.  Robert Downey Jr. is one of my all time favorite actors.  The dude can play any role and make you believe he really is the character he is portraying.  I swear there are times that I now think he actually is Tony Stark.  How can the guy be so versatile?  In addition to these two you have Don Cheadle adequately playing the role of Lt. Colonel Rhodes, with Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell and of course Mickey Rourke rounding out the bunch.  Jon Favreau even continued his role as the body guard while directing the movie in the background.

For me sequels are always a little hard to swallow since the initial introduction to the general theme has been lost.  You go into a sequel knowing more of what to expect so they are easily predictable.  Iron Man II was just that.  It was predictable in the plot, theme, general flow but setting that aside it was also pretty damn good.  Filled with action, great acting, and as always in the world of Tony Stark, lots of sarcasm and a bevy of smoking hot women.  The latter being one of my favorite parts in any movie.

The opening scene kicks off with the Tony Stark (Iron Man) jumping from a plane and landing in the middle of some Las Vegas dancers, as he kicks off his yearlong expo on technology.  Is there anyone but me that thinks they were making fun of some needless trade shows out there?  We find out a few minutes into the movie that Tony Stark's much heralded power supply is actually killing him.  He doesn't have long to live.  He then spends a good chunk of his time trying to find a replacement source to save his life, and to keep his suit charged up for some good ass whooping.

When you throw in Ivan Vanko, who is just one badass dude, you now have the makings of a struggle for supremacy, with good fighting evil.  Isn't that what super hero movies are all about.  Mickey Rourke might be a bizarre guy in real life but every time the guy gets on screen he shows you why he is a great actor.  When Iron Man replicas start popping up trying to kill Tony off, the action begins and everything around everyone starts blowing up.  What can I say, if you love action movies filled with sarcastic one liners and a comedic overtone you will enjoy the movie.  There is an endless supply of both.

I would have to surmise the movie was predictable but definitely enjoyable.  I can laughingly say this review might even be a waste of time since everyone on the planet has probably seen the movie already anyway.  If you haven't then you probably should.  You will know what to expect when you enter the theater and you will leave not having been disappointed and in my opinion thoroughly entertained.",1273881600,,2825,4.401544401544402

3841141,4,B0021L8V1Q,"It won't be long until there are hundreds of reviews up for Iron Man 2, many of which will say the same things but here's my take.  I won't go into a plot synopsis (there will be plenty) but will point out where it succeeded and where it missed.

Success - Tony Stark.  Once again Robert Downy Jr. IS Tony Stark.  Part jerk, part nice guy, eccentric (I don't like people handing me things), a genius and totally self absorbed. He's such a flawed and human character - this part of what makes him such a fun character to watch.  What other hero puts on his super suit and gets drunk (OK aside from the Comedian).  It's so fun to realize most of his problems are all his own fault.

Miss - Pepper Potts.  I liked her in the first movie but I didn't see any development here.  She seemed static and a bit of a whiner.

Success - Hammer.  Stark's rival and replacement weapons contractor to the military.  Calling Sam Rockwell's character the anti-Stark has already become clich so I'll just say that he was fun to watch and fun to hate.

Miss - Rhodes.  I didn't think Don Cheadle brought any more to the roll than Terrence Howard and I never really believed in this supposed strong friendship between Stark and Rhodes.  I didn't hate him or love him he was just there.

Success - Whiplash/Ivan.  Mickey Rourke plays this villain in an understated way.  No big theatrics or speeches (no monologueing) just an attack on the man he hates.  And seriously if there is one man I do not ever want to be on the bad side of it is Mickey Rourke.  And kudos to the movie for not feeling the need to name every villain and character.  Imagine how easily it could have turned into camp if he'd busted out on the track and yelled, ""Call me Whiplash!""  Plenty of other movies fall into this trap of feeling they have to name the villain.  Dude, we know who it is.

Success - Black Widow.  I was really unsure about her inclusion and the casting but it all turned out really well and Scarlet really brought it.  Her action scenes were smoothly executed and not too over the top.

Success - War Machine armor = Awesome.

You'll notice a trend above that these points have to do mostly with the characters.  That's because they are all so much fun to watch interact for the most part - even the miss ones are elevated by the success ones.  For example a big fight between a drunk Tony and a mad Rhody, both in armor, is a highlight.  I will admit that there are long stretches of no action but in those stretches is *character development* which is nice so we care about what happends during the action.  When the action comes it is great.  I will admit that the final action piece did not cause as much tension as the first one though - I didn't quite feel the danger like I had during that first battle.

It's easy to look at this cast of characters and fear that the movie will be come an overloaded mess (Spider-Man 3, Batman and Robin) but it doesn't which is an achievement in itself.

There were copious amounts of Avenger foreshadowing going on.  Someone is getting excited at the studio.  There are lots of little winks for the fans but I could see it being overlooked by the non-fan.

Are there plot holes?  Yeah, a couple.  But nothing disastrous and I'm sure there are bits on the cutting room floor that would have plugged them.  For me it was when the heck did Tony decide to install an independent arc reactor in the Mark II?  But then it was hinted that maybe he wanted Rhodes to take the suit.

It is a very fun and worthwhile movie so I'll be crossing my fingers for IM3.  You know some studio exec is going to step in and try to overstuff it.  Stay strong John Favreau.",1273795200,3,3668,4.306002928257687
3841142,3,B0021L8V1Q,"Of course it is important to understand that this is a movie based on a comic strip.  It is not and was never intended to be great cinematic art but it is a fun movie and entertaining.

Property Destruction = 4 stars -- The Taliban must be dying of envy

Screen Play = 4 stars -- saved by final scene with Senator Stern which was very clever

Personal Hygiene = 1 star -- I am sort  of tired of seeing the leading men walking around looking like they haven't shaved in days or taken  a bath in weeks.

3841143,4,B0021L8V1Q,"As in the first Iron Man movie, Robert Downey Jr's personality comes across lots bigger than his physical person. The fast patter and winning wisecracks usually carry the movie when the comic-book effects don't - and there are some great effects. Paltrow's character, 'Pepper' Potts comes across with the right urgency and sincerity. Scarlett Johansson's spy babe fits that black catsuit flawlessly. Tony Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, creates a spoiled, whiny character with too much money for his own good - the kind you love to dislike, since he's not even evil enough to hate. And, of course, Mickey Rourke's 'Vanko' makes an electrifying badguy.

Despite the great comic book styling, a few things fell flat. Comic book outsiders will scratch their heads over Nick Fury and SHIELD (""huh? where'd that come from?""). Everyone will scratch their heads over Potts's sudden promotion, once they see how Stark seems to undermine her (or try to) every time she tries to get the new job done. And, despite hints that he's not really as out of control as he seems, Stark being that out of control is just out of character - even RDJr's free-wheeling character.

But, c'mon. You don't go to comic book movies for deep motivation or exploration of the human soul. You go for the BamPow goodness of a summer popcorn flick - and this offers plenty.

It has become almost obligatory for everyone to say that this film is not as good as the first, but I liked it more.  Director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux incorporated a large number of elements from the Marvel Universe (Iron Man, Whiplash, Nick Fury and SHIELD, the Black Widow, Justin Hammer, War Machine) but made it all pull together in a coherent narrative.  This bodes well for the upcoming Avengers film, which Favreau will help produce.  The motif of the basically good but also weak man within the invulnerable suit of armor is used to good effect, but even the more weighty aspects of the film are handled with a light touch that keeps it hugely entertaining.  Also, character is not sacrificed for the sake of spectacle.  There may not be as much action as some might wish, but when it comes it really lets loose and the context gives it real stakes.",1273708800,5,1168,4.786069651741293
3841145,5,B0021L8V1Q,"""Iron Man 2"" is certainly a step up from ""Iron Man"". Where this sequel succeeds is in it's story. While ""Iron Man"" was a lot of fun, it was essentially 2 hrs of Tony Stark building three different suits and Robert Downey Jr. being witty. While it's not a terrible film by any means it's scope was rather small. With ""Iron Man 2"" we really get to open this world up and get to see who these characters are. We get a fully developed story with a couple different points of views. This is a great example of a sequel that can give the audience more of what made the first film work (in terms of action, effects, humor) and can also balance it out with bigger characterization, drama and more surprises. I thought that writer Justin Theroux handled it all very nicely in his clever script and director Jon Favreau (returning to the helm), does wonders with his fantastic cast. It's in that ensemble cast (that includes Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson) where the film really connects. These are all extremely talented and charming actors working in top form. The acting does not need to be good for sci-fi films like this (which baffles me) but here the director and his cast are handed a script that breathes life into it's players and makes the proceedings all the more fun. Where ""Iron Man"" was a character study first and an action movie second, ""Iron Man 2"" puts both of those aspects front and center, making it mentally engaging and a hell of a lot of fun. ""Iron Man 2"" is better than ""Iron Man"" and certainly one of the more graceful sequels to cross the silver screen since ""The Dark Knight"".",1273708800,3,1666,4.538205980066445
3841146,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Iron Man 2 explodes and lights up the screen with great action sequences, timely humor & an actor in Robert Downey Jr. that is perfectly cast as the cocky playboy Tony Stark. Yet, with all the superhero movies we've been seeing over the past few years, I'm afraid the FORMULA has become routine and stale.

Don't get me wrong, Iron Man 2 delivers on nearly all levels but this movie reminded me of Spiderman 3 in a way.  A slam bam beginning. A gushy uneventful middle and a slam bam ending. Iron Man 2 even took the stalish step of duplicating themselves. Just like the first movie when Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) stepped into the mammoth, souped up original Iron Man suit, Ivan Vanko/Whiplash steps into a souped up, mammoth suit of his own creation. My apologies for saying it, but ""ho, hum"".

It's almost like Paramount knows they have us by the cahones with Spiderman, Iron Man, Thor & Captain America, and they have this cookie cutter screenplay machine that kicks em' out with the least amount of expense on their behalf. ""If we give em' a more complicated script, we're gonna have to put in more Iron Man scenes in the middle and that's expensive. And of course we have Thor, Captain America & another Iron Man to think about. Keep it simple. Keep the cost down.""

I just couldn't help thinking this after I left the movie. I hated Spiderman 3 for this very reason. I was nodding off in the middle for godsakes. Christopher Nolan delivered with Dark Knight. He gave us a unique look into the world of Batman that was interesting throughout and had us EMOTIONALLY involved. Heck, even the original Batman series knew that people didn't want talking... they wanted Batman.

Anyway, despite the uneventful middle to this movie, where the most exciting scene was Tony Stark dancing around drunk in the Iron Man suit shooting fruit, it is still a good movie that is certainly worth a trip to the cinema and a purchase on DVD or Blu-Ray... just, one of these days... we're gonna have to demand more for all the money we've made the studio.

3841147,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Behind the armored suits and superb special effects, Iron Man 2 is a tough story of a fall from grace and redemption. Director Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. (reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man) dare to give the man behind the iron mask a mission besides saving the world: saving himself, with a little help from unexpected friends.

As the story begins, Tony Stark faces the consequences of revealing his Iron Man identity.  The government and a rival arms inventor (an over-the-top Sam Rockwell) want the suit; a revenge-seeking Russian physicist (a perfectly cast Mickey Rourke) is after Tony; and Tony himself is being poisoned by the miniature nuclear reactor that keeps him alive.  Tony slowly self-destructs, wrecking his business, his relationships with long-suffering personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Air Force buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), and finally his status as Iron Man.

At rock bottom, Tony gets a hand up from Colonel Nick Fury of SHIELD (a nicely restrained Samuel L. Jackson).  Fury provides Tony with a means, and a motivation, to work out his own salvation.  En route to a smashing finale, Tony gets a key assist from Fury's undercover contact inside Stark Industries.  As enigmatic SHIELD agent Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson is ""all that"" in a form-fitting unitard; her thrilling hallway fight sequence might have been the centerpiece of a movie with less visual firepower.

Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.

Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.

In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.

The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.

On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be clich.

All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.

The banter between Rhodes and Stark was fantastic. Mickey Rourke did not disappoint as Whiplash. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer was a home run. He almost steals every scene he's in. I was particularly impressed with his role in this film. All in all the cast was great. I attribute this to the brilliant direction of Jon Faverau. The story was clever and unique thanks to the genius who wrote the screenplay for ""Tropic Thunder"" Justin Theroux. All around great movie. Absolutely recommend it to anyone-- not just comic book people.",1273449600,4,914,4.754716981132075

3841151,4,B0021L8V1Q,"The Iron Man 2 sequel begins in Moscow.  It is snowing outside, while an old man, Anton Vanko, lay dying in his bed, his son Ivan sitting next to him.  Apparently Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark) and Anton had worked together many years ago developing plans, but Howard had Anton shipped off to Siberia where he lived the rest of his life in poverty, while Howard Stark became filthy rich. Needless to say, Ivan is a bit upset when daddy dies.  He grabs some plans and starts working feverishly on an Iron Man ""heart"".

Back in New York, Tony Stark is telling the world he is Iron Man and celebrating with a big Expo celebration for single-handedly achieving world peace.  He is summoned to Washington DC to testify before some Senate Committee and asked to turn over the Iron Man suit to the government because it is a weapon.  Of course, his answer is no.

Back in Stark's ocean-front Malibu home, we find out the paladium core so vital to Iron Man is also killing Tony slowly by increasing his blood toxicity levels.  Not telling Gwenyth Paltrow, he appoints her CEO of Stark Industries and his successor, if anything happens to him.

In the famous Monaco street race is where bad-guy Ivan catches up with Tony.  He comes at him with a bad attitude and a bad invention he has cooked up in his little make-shift Moscow lab.

There is a lot of action that follows with the good-guy/bad-guy thing while Tony is trying to find something to keep him from paladium meltdown.  The CGI is great and the Iron Man characters are bigger than life.

I thought the first one was better, maybe because the concept was new or maybe because I waited for this one for awhile.  In any case, the movie was still excellent and well worth seeing.  It was hard to believe that Ivan was Mickey Rourke.  He just looked so totally different to me.",1273363200,,1828,4.493939393939394

3841153,5,B0021L8V1Q,"The summer of 2010 is nearly upon us and here to ring in the blistering heat is the first official blockbuster of the season, ""Iron Man 2"". After the gigantic success of ""Iron Man"" in 2008, the inevitable sequel was quickly announced by Marvel Studios. So, with only two short years to piece together the continuing story of billionaire Tony Stark and his alter-ego Iron Man, director Jon Favreau and company quickly began working on what could possibly be one of the biggest movies, if not the biggest of the year. With expectations surrounding this follow-up understandably high, ""Iron Man 2"" would definitely need to up the stakes and the spectacle in order to meet audience demand. But have no fear true believer (just a little nod to Stan Lee there); this movie succeeds brilliantly on all counts.

""Iron Man 2"" picks up six months after the events of the previous film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is beginning to feel the pressure of living the life of a publicly known superhero. With his behavior growing more and more erratic, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) begin to wonder if Tony's days as Iron Man need to come to a close. Meanwhile, a new threat is emerging onto the scene, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), seeking to destroy Tony Stark for sins of the father, so to speak. Plus, a rival weapons manufacturer, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), is trying to create his own version of the Iron Man armor, and will stop at nothing to achieve his ambitious goal. With so much at stake, Tony will have to look inside himself to rediscover the man behind the armor, and in a sense re-forge the Iron Man.

The first film featured a terrific blend of action, comedy (well-written and smart, not so much tongue-in-cheek), drama, and stunning visual effects to bring the hero to life. With ""Iron Man 2"" the action is even more intense, with bigger special effects sequences, but this time the comedy takes more of a backseat to make room for a much more dramatic storyline. Put all of these elements together and mix them just right and you've got yourself a recipe for another successful superhero jaunt.

The action sequences in the original were fast-paced and well-executed pieces of summer movie fun. However, the action in this film blows away everything that was done before with considerable ease. If you thought that there wasn't enough armored action the first-go-round, then ""Iron Man 2"" should definitely meet your needs. If nothing else, the final 30 minutes of the movie will leave even the most ardent action junkie satisfied for quite some time.

Assisting in creating the incredible action scenes is some truly impressive visual effects work courtesy once more from Industrial Light and Magic. The visuals' seamless blend with the live action elements makes the futuristic aspects of the movie more believable rather than if the CGI had been over-the-top. Case in point, the holographic imagery Stark uses when associating/working with JARVIS in the lab. This obvious usage of CGI while very apparent doesn't seem all that removed from our reality, to the point that one could easily see this tech being available in the not so distant future. Not to mention all of the CGI intensive moments featuring Iron Man and War Machine in action are so exciting, and for comic book lovers, seeing the duo fighting side-by-side is simply incredible. Their scenes alone make it worth watching on the big screen at least one time.

Of course, the glue holding all of the exciting visuals and thrilling action sequences together is the solid screenplay written by Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder""), featuring elements loosely based upon the acclaimed ""Demon in a Bottle"" storyline from the comic books. As I stated earlier, the original film featured plenty of humor, wit, and sarcasm (primarily from Tony), this installment opts for a more mature tone which is very appropriate given the upheavals occurring in Tony's life after his proclamation of, ""I am Iron Man."" So, for those of you hoping for the same light-hearted fare, sorry not this time, and honestly the movie works well without it.

Now, there are some that felt this darker tinged story, especially in the first half of the movie, causes this entry to not feel as fun or entertaining as its predecessor. Personally, I felt the thematic shift was a natural progression for the character (not to mention keeping in-line with the comic book source material), and had the humor remained front-and-center then the story would have fallen flat on its face. While I do understand the detractors' point of view, the lesser success of the two ""Fantastic Four"" movies should serve as a prime example of allowing for too much humor, thus, overshadowing the potential for good dramatic storytelling. Thankfully, screenwriter Justin Theroux and director Jon Favreau managed to avoid the aforementioned movies' pratfall, and the drama was allowed a chance to thrive.

Of course, the story would be nothing without the incredible cast assembled to breathe life into these iconic characters. Leading the assemblage once more is Hollywood's most successful comeback kid, Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Robert appears to be relishing the opportunity to reprise what could easily be called his most recognizable role. Robert once again brings his smooth talking, hyper-active personality to the character, but with a darker edge than previously seen. Portraying a man on the edge of losing his way, Robert's terrific performance was most likely influenced by his own infamous past. Even with the darker thematic elements, Downey, Jr. manages to keep things interesting and from sinking too far down during the film's gloomy, yet necessary moments.

In the supporting roles we find actress Gwyneth Paltrow returning as Pepper Potts. While Gwyneth easily holds her own opposite Robert, and their scenes are always rife with a playful tension and chemistry; sadly, it felt like her role was somewhat diminished from that of the original film. Even though she was featured throughout the entire duration, often times she seemed to be more of an afterthought to the scenes. Obviously, in a film with such a large cast, fitting everyone in with equal time is a difficult task, so I do understand that some judicious editing had to be done. Also, I'm not saying that having a little less Pepper Potts results in a less enjoyable movie, not in the least bit. I was just surprised more than anything to see her character on the backburner.

The character of Lt. Col. James Rhodes, portrayed this time by Don Cheadle (""Traitor"") replacing Terrence Howard, is much more involved in not only the story, but also the action sequences, due to his donning of the War Machine armor. I was curious as to what I was going to think of Don Cheadle as Rhodes compared to Terrence, since I enjoyed his portrayal in the first movie. However, after seeing the movie I was left wishing Cheadle would have portrayed the character in both films. As good of an actor as Terrence Howard is, Don Cheadle really looked like he fit the part, and played the role perfectly both in and out of the armor. Cheadle just came off as a harder, more militaristic man in his portrayal, whereas Terrence seemed more on the softer side and slightly out of place in the role by comparison. It's too bad we can't go back and do some re-shoots to insert Don Cheadle into the original movie for better continuity.

Several new characters joined the cast of the expanding Marvel movie universe as we were introduced to Stark Industries' main business rival Justin Hammer, the villainous Ivan Vanko, and undercover spy Natasha Romanoff. Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") is perfectly sniveling and smarmy as Justin Hammer. He's a man who, like Tony Stark, is recognized for his weapons manufacturing, but unlike Stark he has no qualms about eliminating whoever gets in his way. As the film's primary villain, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash, Mickey Rourke (""Sin City"") is creepy, brilliant, cold, and calculating in every aspect of his plot for vengeance against the Stark family and their business empire.

Now, Mickey Rourke may be a strange guy in the real world, and some could even argue a bit unstable, but one thing is for certain, he is one great actor. His performance was spot on every step of the way. For instance, unlike so many American actors, he never once appeared to struggle to maintain his character's Russian accent throughout the whole duration. This character will not garner him the accolades that his role in ""The Wrestler"" did, but he should be recognized all the same for continually putting terrific work on display every time he hits the screen.

Rounding out the newcomers is Scarlett Johansson (""The Island"") as Natasha Romanoff, otherwise known as the Black Widow in the comic book world. Scarlett establishes her character in a humorous moment early on as being much more than what she seems, and from there we are given a character that is smart, sexy, and above all, lethal. After seeing her in this movie, I can't wait to see more of Scarlett's take on the Black Widow in future installments of this series or maybe even in some of the other Marvel franchises that are in the works.

Lastly, Samuel L. Jackson returns once more as the Director of S.H.I.E.LD., Nick Fury. At the end of the previous film, we are introduced to Nick Fury, albeit ever so briefly. Thankfully, this time around he is given a little bit more screen time, popping up every once in a while over the course of the movie. Samuel is clearly enjoying his role as the Marvel Universe's top spy, and is leaving fans wanting to see more of his character in the future films.

So, when all is said and done, without a doubt ""Iron Man 2"" easily lives up to all the hype. Boasting an engaging story that is filled with terrific characters, plenty of new plot developments, and incredible action scenes that are brimming with stunning CGI; director Jon Favreau's follow-up delivers in every way imaginable and even manages to surpass its predecessor. Not a bad day's work for a superhero.

3841155,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is flying high, at the top of his game, or so it seems.  He's single-handedly managed to shut down the arms race, achieving de facto world peace, and his rivals aren't even close. Or so he thinks.  It turns out he and his father before him have made some hidden enemies along the way to corporate and personal success, and the U.S. military (not to mention nearly every other world power) doesn't like being preempted by a cocky upstart, and won't rest until they own the Iron Man suit or its equivalent.  Add to that daddy issues, frustrations at work with a frazzled overcompensating secretary and a beautiful and dangerous new assistant, and the stage is set for a classic escalation towards a massive climax.  It gets busy, and even goes dark here and there, especially when we see the super baddy evil genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), but never loses the playful and comic tone established by Robert Downey, Jr., his best friend Don Cheadle (Lt. Rhodes), and his incompetent archrival Sam Rockwell (Justin Hammer). For me the coolest parts of both films were the construction sequences, that make engineering complex and high power equipment look more fun than video games - as in this one when Stark gets a bright idea and remodels his entire house in order to construct a cool new energy source. Nothing profound, but lots of fun.",1273276800,,1365,4.722689075630252
3841156,5,B0021L8V1Q,"""Iron Man 2"" is more than a worthy sequel to the original Iron Man film. The majority of the good guys return intact - Robert Downey, Jr as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark and his powerful alter ego, Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's right hand assistant, Pepper Potts, and Jon Favreau (also the the two films' director) as Stark's bodyguard, Happy Hogan, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, head of the SHIELD intelligence agency. Two new actors join this group -  Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard as Stark friend and Air Force officer, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Rushman, Stark's new aide who turns into a lot more.

The bad guys are Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, a son of a former business partner of Stark's father. The elder Vanko dies at the beginning of the film, setting the son on a quest for vengeance that results in a suit much like Stark's, including a powerful electrical whip. Whiplash, as Rourke's character comes to be known, makes a very public attempt to kill Stark. After the attempt fails, Vanko is rescued from prison by Justin Hammer, a business rival of Stark's who wants to use Vanko's expertise to create more powerful armor and sell it to the US military.

Add to this already potent mix several other complications - Stark's deepening relationship with Pepper, who he anoints as his replacement at Stark Industries, his growing egotism and hubris that makes very vulnerable to attack, and his body's rejection of the power cell in his chest that is grdually killing him, and you have a movie with a huge cast, lots of plot entanglements, and lots and lots of action.

But it all works. The cast is terrific, the movie is alternately thrilling, funny, and touching, and the viewer doesn't leave this movie feeling that they don't want to see Iron Man 3. And for the movie studio, Marvel, regular cast members and movie fans, what happens next in the Iron Man franchise promises to be a very, very good thing.",1273276800,,1978,4.741279069767442

3841158,4,B0021L8V1Q,"There's nothing like that first kiss, yeah, and so even though IRON MAN 2 comes out and unleashes its share of awesomeness, even though it is very much worth a look, the mystery is gone, the expectations met, we've, er, already copped that feel. IRON MAN 2, good as it is, doesn't drop on us like lightning in a bottle, and so it isn't quite as exhilarating. What it does give us is more of that good Robert Downey, Jr.

The guy has made the Invincible Iron Man into his own, and I can't see anyone else now as Tony Stark, and I'm betting you can't, either. Downey brings the same devilish, bigger-than-life charisma, that same brash ""I'm Tony Stark! Who the eff are you?!"" swagger. Tony Stark is brilliant and ego-centric, but he's got good intentions. His heart's in the right place, and so we forgive the rampant narcissism. Plus, he's a fun dude to be around.

IRON MAN 2 chronicles Tony's fall from grace and his redemption. Six months ago Tony Stark told the world that he was Iron Man. But has fame and success gone to his head? He's been more eccentric lately, indulging even more in hedonism lately, and he's conducting the Stark Expo like it's a rock concert (which is actually bloody cool). Certain parties are worried. Iron Man's arrival had gone a ways into ensuring global peace or at least global detente. But six months later, the American government - as embodied in the person of the slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) - is itching to get its paws on the Iron Man tech and, so, Tony has to attend senate hearings. Stark, in his own inimitable manner, blows the hearings out of the water.

There's a fatal flaw in the schematics, a gremlin in the wires. Carefree on the outside, on the inside Tony is very concerned. The palladium element in the arc reactor in his chest is gradually poisoning him, and each use of the Iron Man armor accelerates the condition. But he keeps up the pretense, having informed no one of his impending death. Maybe you can't blame the guy for carrying on so.

I actually expected this movie to delve into Tony's alcoholism (from the classic story arc in the comics), but we only get a peek at the man's fondness for booze. We do get moments when we see the flamboyant playboy take a sippy, as well as one epic drunken binge at a party (while in armor, no less). This public eff-up sends Tony's credibility plummeting, and that slimy senator's smirk just got even smirkier.

Rival industrialist Justin Hammer isn't the Big Bad of the movie, but Sam Rockwell supplies him with a pronounced air of unctuousness, and you hate him. Hammer, fed up with languishing in Stark's shadow, hires a crazed and tattooed Russian physicist to craft his own arsenal of armored suits, and a Russian physicist played by the menacing Mickey Rourke probably would have no choice but to be crazed and tattooed. They don't call Rourke's character by his supervillain code name, but it's Whiplash (with a smidge of Crimson Dynamo thrown in). He nurses a serious grudge against Tony and Tony's father, Howard Stark, who had a falling out with Whiplash's own inventor father. But how does Rourke get away with chewing a toothpick all the time?

IRON MAN 2 isn't magic like the first movie and that initial sense of novelty has worn off, but it's still terrific and the scale is bigger. Downey's presence drives the thing, and the fact that we don't mind that Tony Stark is onscreen more than Iron Man says something about the skills set Downey brings to the party. We still get that good banter between him and Gwyneth Paltrow. Don Cheadle takes over from Terrence Howard, and it's like he's always been on board as Rhodey. The f/x is flawless state of the art stuff; there's nothing like heavy metal clashing resoundingly. If you've at all seen the posters and the trailer, then you already know War Machine would make his debut, and he may not be as impressive as the ol' shellhead but, damn, he's got all those big mounted guns. And, for dessert, curvy Scarlett Johansson steps into the franchise as the smoking hot Black Widow and she demonstrates high levels of kickassery. And oh that sexy black leather....

I only wish Pepper Potts were given more stuff to do.

Jon Favreau features himself more as Happy Hogan, a chauffer in this incarnation, and I'm not mad at Favreau. What's the point of being director if you can't call your own number once in a while? Meanwhile, IRON MAN 2, in a scene here and there, gets us another step closer to that Avengers movie. Somewhere, executives from DC Comics must be gnashing their teeth, late to the game, lagging behind. The Green Lantern movie had better be something.

And, as become a habit with Marvel Studios flicks, stick around until after the closing credits, yeah? Nerd nirvana awaits.",1273276800,8,4765,4.629585798816568

3841160,4,B0021L8V1Q,"While Iron Man 2 may not be perfect, it is a very solid and fun sequel. Improvements include better action sequences and some great characters added to the franchise. Unfortunately there is a lot going on here and even though it isn't hard to follow, there isn't enough time to give each sub plot the proper screen time it deserves. Oddly enough for a super hero film, I think they could have edited some of the talky scenes down and added a little more Iron Man action.

A good example of this is when we meet Natasha Romanova she isn't given much to do and I found myself wondering if she was going to be The Black Widow on screen. She is only in one action sequence(a great one with one of the funniest moments in the film)late in the movie and she and Nick Fury are really only there to set up The Avengers movie. I'm not saying it should be edited out, but there is only so much ground you can cover in two hours. Whiplash is played with gusto by Mickey Rourke, but he doesn't have much screen time either and that seems to be the problem with this film, no one but Tony Stark gets enough screen time.

After the first encounter with Whiplash in Monaco on the race track, we don't really get a good dose of Iron man until the final battle, which means there is over an hour of time where there isn't that much action. Considering what I had read about this being an action packed film, I found it to be very talky. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the characters are well developed and the actors are all really good here.

The final battle is very good with some very cool Iron Man destruction and some nifty moves, but it's surprising and anti-climatic when Whiplash is defeated very quickly. In the first film, I thought the final battle was too long and in this one, it just seems to end too abruptly. I'm not bashing this film in any way as it is a very fun film that I will most certainly own the DVD/Blu Ray when it is released, but I think the story may have been a little too ambitious for one film.

Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B(4 stars)and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered. Of course if you are seeing this in a theater, then stick around until the end of the credits role for a little teaser scene about another Marvel Hero who will be hitting theaters next year.",1273276800,83,2322,4.234762979683973
3841161,4,B0021L8V1Q,"It is inevitable to compare the sequel to it's 2008 original, and the first IRON MAN was great, fanboy status aside I recommended it to everyone....I would make the same recommendation for IM2, across the board.... But if you are a fanboy, you already know this because you went to the midnight show!

Robert Downey Jr.  was talked about connected with the role long before it became a fact, so he is still dream casting for the role of Tony Stark, and he still exceeds expectations as the Industrialist, this time facing certain death due to his HEARTcondition. Tony overindulges in the Celebrity, parties and booze as he embraces while searching for a cure and trying to find himself, too . This is a classic IM storyline from the comics, as is his confrontation with WhipLash a. K.a Ivan Venko a.k.a. Mickey Rourke, out to reclaim his family right to the Stark Legacy. Meanwhile,  the government and wacky , rival weapons-manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) are pressuring Tony to turn the IRON MAN tech over to the government. Once flippantly reassuring the Senate committee that he has things under control, Venko appears and all hell busts loose. Stark's best bud Col 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time Don Cheadle)is out to help Tony back on track while struggling with his own duties and responsibilities to protect the Country.

The story is a little crowed with Whiplash working on his revenge, Rhodey overcoming his personal obstacles and Tony's, the slinky agent Black widow infiltrating Stark Industries while Tony's unrequited love Pepper Potts (Paltrow) takes over the Company while it appears that holding on to the IM tech was a mistake, once an armored super villain appears, and later a haywire drone army. Although, I would question the point of Scarlett Johansson's character , but for the super-spy cat suit fight sequence along with director Jon Favreau, which causes me to preemptively retract said statement and enjoy the spandex and party dresses. And Venko's backstory is thankfully short , as is the movie get to the action, from the Opening scene the film is high energy and beautiful graphics.... everything  from the dancing EXPO  girls...the Iron Man-ites, to  the fight between IRON MAN and War Machine (for non-geeks War Machine is the armor Rhodes wears during his time as IRON MAN in the comics, seen in IM1). In fact the fight between Tony and Rhodes at the party to a mix-music is worth admission!!!

Cheadle as Rhodey was a good swap the great chemistry between him and RDJr., RDJr. and Paltrow still great. Robert Downey Jr. slips right back ...I'm reminded by IM2 why I was a such a hugh Rourke fan even thru the STUPId Yrs...he does soooo much with soooo little, count Rourke's lines, most  in Russian and tell me it ain't an amazing performance, the presences...(while you are at it look up Angel Heart and Prayer for the Dying, 2 great Mickey Rourke movies). Watch for an homage or two to other AVENGERS characters as the Marvel movies move grow ever nearer to those future releases.... Next stop Thor:The Movie....

Again,  War Machine vs. Iron Man in the same film is worth admission.... War Machine teamed with Iron Man for show down, bonus
stayed after the credits...I advise you to stay....upshot on the film....it rocked don't let some Chicago Tribune reviewer tell ya different, (Tribune gave an uncalled for 2 1/2 ) like the first film, fanboyness aside, it was GOOD!",1273276800,,3424,4.876075731497418
3841162,5,B0021L8V1Q,"Both my husband and I had originally planned to see this movie because we both saw the first Iron Man movie together and enjoyed it.  After viewing the Iron Man 2 movie today, we both are glad to have seen it.  For starters, if you thought highly of the first Iron Man movie, it is safe to say that you are going to enjoy the second.  In addition, I felt that the plot to the first Iron man movie was excellent and well developed. I was uncertain if Iron Man 2 was going to top the first one in action and excitement. Let me say that Iron Man 2 was even better than the first for those who wonder if this is the case. In addition, when Terrence Howard was dropped after the first Iron Man and replaced by Don Cheadle to be Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr's) sidekick in Iron Man 2, I was also unsure how this would play out. Needless to say, Don Cheadle did a fine job as Iron Man's sidekick in this movie. Admittedly, the character that I enjoyed the most was Robert Downey Jr's potrayal as Tony Stark back in action. Robert Downey Jr happens to be one of my favorite actors and he really gave an even stronger performance this time around.  Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his reliable and self confident love interest who is deeply concerned for Tony Stark and wants the best for him.  Scarlet Johanson plays an eloquent femme fatale named Natasha who also cares to help out Tony Stark.  Then there is Mickey Rourke who plays a very convincing nemesis and ""evil genius"" villian named Vanko as the one who targets Tony Stark for revenge. Sam Rockwell plays a calculated senator by the last name of Hammer who craves some of the power that Tony Stark has.  Then there is Gary Shandling who also plays as one of the congressman who also seems to desire some of the influence of the Iron Man.  Samuel Jackson happens to also make an appearance as one of the men who is for the Iron Man. Overall, a strong all star cast and I feel that an excellent job was done on casting the characters for their respective parts.  It was exciting to see the romantic side of Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark character strive to continue in impressing Pepper Potts while simultaneously being forced to come to terms with maintaining the powerful and heroic legacy of his job as Iron Man,with some exciting scenes thrown in for strong measure. This is a great date night movie that both men and women are going to enjoy.  From my perspective, the very talented Robert Downey Jr. has also solidified his status as one of the talented actors to watch for years to come (his acting continues to get better and better in my modest opinion).",1273190400,9,2609,4.394190871369295
3841163,4,B0021L8V1Q,"At the end of 2008, I made two bold assertions: (1) That ""Iron Man"" was one of the year's best films; (2) that ""Iron Man"" was one of the greatest superhero films ever made. I still believe both to be true. Now we have ""Iron Man 2."" While it is thoroughly entertaining, it's also a bit conventional when compared to its predecessor, having less of a compelling story but more in the ways of action, special effects, gadgets, humor, and stunt work. It's a comic book through and through. That's fine by me - what it lacks in introspection it more than makes up for in sheer fun. We have plenty to cheer for, not the least of which is our hero, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), who when we last left him had shut down the weapon's division of his company to focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. The result was a high tech metal suit equipped with rocket boosters and missile launchers.

It's now six months after Stark revealed himself as Iron Man at a press conference. Despite the demands of a United States Senate committee, he refuses to share his technology with the American military, believing that world peace can be maintained only if it's privatized. At this meeting, he humiliates Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of a rival company who has unsuccessfully tried to outdo Stark's technology with his own prototype machines; in an effort to get ahead, Hammer appeals to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who publically revealed his grudge against Stark by attacking him as he was car racing in Monaco. For as yet unknown reasons, Vanko has constructed an arc reactor very similar to the one implanted in Stark's chest. He has improved the design by attaching whips that surge with bolts of electrical energy.

Stark, meanwhile, is realizing that his chest implant, originally constructed as a way to keep him alive, contains an element that's slowly poisoning him. He doesn't handle it well. He acts out. He drinks in excess. He hastily appoints his former personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), as the new CEO of his company. If he's to survive, he must replace the core of the implant with an entirely new element, one he has tried but failed to create on his own. Out of the blue comes special agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who suggests that Stark look to his father's research for guidance.

New to the cast is Don Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard as Stark's dedicated but weary friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes. Also new is Scarlett Johansson as Stark's newly hired personal assistant Natalie Rushman, who says she's from the company's legal department.

Watching this movie, I was quite dazzled by the sights and sounds, and I found the plot engaging in a suspension-of-disbelief kind of way. I did not, however, find it persuasive, as I did the first film, which I felt put a refreshing and thought-provoking spin on the traditional comic book adversary; Stark might have physically battled with the power-hungry Obadiah Stane, but his real enemies were war and injustice, both of which he took part in by selling weapons of mass destruction. This time around, it's much more by the book - a superhero pitted against a madman out for revenge, a fight to the finish that includes a lot of things blowing up, a showcase of digital wizardry and highly choreographed stunts. There are a number of films that can give you pretty much the same thing.

That being said, there's no denying the quality of the performances, especially Downey, whose cocky take on Stark makes the film fun but not jokey. Rockwell is quite good, playing Hammer is if he were Stark's slightly goofier evil twin - comedy relief with a hint of something darker, you might say. Credit also to Rourke, who truly does convey the anger, resentment, and pain his character feels in every one of his scenes. He isn't given all that much screen time, but when he's on, he's on, resonating with a deep, calm, frighteningly low voice and an imposing build.

If there is an ""Iron Man 3,"" and I have no doubt that there will be, I can only hope it doesn't follow its predecessor's lead and decline in quality. The original ""Iron Man"" was a superb film, redefining the superhero genre for both old and new generations of moviegoers. ""Iron Man 2"" is a great looking and wonderfully performed sequel, although its approach to the story is routine, more so than I had preferred it to be. Still, you've got to hand it to director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux - they sure know how to entertain an audience. There's an early scene in which Stark, dressed as Iron Man, jumps off a plane, flies through the sky, and lands unharmed in the middle of one of his own lavishly high tech expos in New York City. Throngs of people cheer him on. I suspect the audiences for this movie will do the same when it's over.",1273190400,46,4860,4.691676436107855
3841164,4,B0021L8V1Q,"The first Iron Man was and still is a very strong comic book film. It would have been the best of 2008 by far if not for a little movie called The Dark Knight. Now, a couple of years later we have the two leads back with a number of new big name additions, and some impressive CGI as expected.

Robert Downey Jr. continues to shine as Tony Stark, with an ego the size of the planet, and Gwyneth Paltrow still has great chemistry with him. Add to the mix a neat villain, Whiplash, played by the always excellent Mickey Rourke, the lovely Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Don Cheadle as Rhodey/War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. You won't find a film in this genre with a cast list this strong. Even though it felt like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson were stuck in here just for a reference towards The Avengers movie of the future, it worked for me, especially Scarlett's fight scene towards the end. Don Cheadle was a great choice for replacing Terrence Howard. I'm still not sure why they got rid of him, but I didn't miss his feminine voice one bit. For me, as great as Robert Downey is in this role, both villains stole the show. The brilliant choice to underplay the part worked wonders for Mickey Rourke. His muscular body, covered head to toe in tattoos, along with his multi-colored hair, gold teeth, Russian accent, toothpick, and complete with a parrot on his shoulder, made him one of the most interesting characters for appearances alone. He could have gone way overboard with this character, but he keeps his cool and is even more believable for it. Sam Rockwell has always been an actor that may not have name recognition to everyone, but from the time I first saw him in The Green Mile until last years Moon, he turns in one solid performance after the next. He is like a darker version of Tony Stark, complete with a large personality and more than his share of funny lines.

I have only a few gripes. I didn't care for the pacing. It seemed much longer than two hours and I typically have no problem watching long movies. Compared to the first Iron Man, some scenes were closing in on boring, but thankfully what works here, works really well. The dialogue was pretty strong and often very funny, but the script as a whole could have been thought out a little better. There is almost too much going on and too many people to fit into one story. Like the previous film, there is also a lack of action. The story always comes first, but this sequel could have let loose a whole lot more. When it does, you get some real good stuff, like the scene with Whiplash slicing up the race cars.

As far as sequels go, Iron Man 2 is better than most, but it's not everything it could have been, or what most people were hoping for. Still, it's a fun ride from start to finish and a great way to start off the summer movie season.",1273190400,,2891,4.4
3841165,4,B0021L8V1Q,"I didn't read a lot of comics when I was a kid, but I'm willing to bet Iron Man director Jon Favreau did. He has an affinity for adding just the right touch of reality to back up the color and action for a superhero movie. A lot of sequels make the mistake of just reiterating the first movie, happily Iron Man 2 doesn't try to mirror what they think are the successful elements of the first movie and move the storyline along.

Iron Man 2 picks up six months after the end of the first movie. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is the fast talking industrialist who has outed himself as Iron Man. In that six months Iron Man has created world peace, although, the Iron Man suit is slowly poisoning him. As other nations scramble to create the technology of Iron Man for their own purposes, a hawkish Senator (Garry Shandling) wants Stark to turn over the Iron Man ""weapon"" to the Government. In Russia, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) labors away in a grimy workshop trying to regain his place in the world that he thinks Tony Stark's father stole from him. Working from his father's plans he creates an ARC reactor (the reactor that also powers Iron Man) of his own and tries to kill Tony Stark with the supercharged whiplash. I'd give a fuller synopsis but the rest of the action of the movie derives from these events and I think you'll enjoy discovering for yourself what happens next when you see the movie.

Robert Downey Jr is excellent as the bon vivant, Tony Stark/Iron Man, who for all his best intentions, his drinking problem is catching up with him and starts affecting the integrity of Iron Man. Don Cheadle does a turn as Lt. Col. James Rhodes (replacing Terrence Howard) as Stark's military liaison and best friend. Mickey Rourke continues his string of strong performances as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, and although the part could have been pushed over the top, Rourke plays it gritty and realistic. Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux are smart enough to build a strong story to carry and provide a reason for the action instead of having action drive the story.

The few minor criticisms of the movie, Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer seems a little too much a caricature, I couldn't tell if he was trying to play the character straight or was trying to be a little campy with it. Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff in her fight scene it looks lifted from the Matrix and even seems to resemble Matrix ""bullet time"" filming which is different than any other part of the movie. The studio seems to be trying to plant too many seeds of upcoming movies, a Captain America reference, and the post credit coda sequence. In the movie we're given a reason to suspend our disbelief and believe in a world that can have an Iron Man (or a Batman) but if you start having super-heros pop up all over the place it starts to seem unreal and cartoony.

Iron Man 2 is a strong follow-up to the first movie and you shouldn't miss a chance to see it.",1273190400,2,2956,4.5507518796992485

3841168,4,B0021L8V1Q,"Had the good fortune to see this while in Asia. Ha ha!

I was worried because the first review I read panned it for many issues, foremost of which was having too many disparate plot threads and a low-stakes tussle (over who wins an arms deal). I'm happy to say this is not the case at all.

IM2 picks up where 1 left off. Tony Stark is a one-man peacekeeping (and peacemaking) machine, but he's gradually being poisoned by the palladium in his power source. This is turning him to drink and general recklessness, which puts his friends and others at risk, in a few exciting set pieces throughout, one of which is an amazing attack during an F1 race.

Meanwhile, Mickey Rourke plays Vanko, the son of his father's ex-partner who is hatching plans for what he considers revenge, having access to similar technical knowledge. I will not divulge further details, so you can guess at what is true and what is not.

Sam Rockwell is a rival arms manufacturer, Hammer, who tries to use Vanko to further his arms race against Stark. As usual, the exchanges between him and Vanko are the most boring and predictable of the movie, because we all know what bad guys are going to say, well ahead of time, because, well, they're bad. (As one writer has put it, it is the saints (in this case, Tony and friends) who are the real characters; they're more believable and unpredictable because of their internal struggles.) But they do their best with the material they're given. He does his dancing cameo here, never fear.

So, as the negative review I first read says, the stakes seem to be really low - it's about who wins the arms deal. But it really isn't, and I think you'll see that. The deal is only the surface of a greater threat.

Another thread is Tony's interest in Johannson's character versus Paltrow's. But this is also part of the overall scheme of things, not a throwaway. I didn't see at first how Tony could get sidetracked from Pepper, but I guess it's part of his deterioration, and of course makes for some romantic tension. As seen in the previews, Johannson will get into some matrix-like action, interspersed with some other (fighting) action involving Tony's driver to humorous effect.

Yet another thread is resolving Tony's relationship with his father. Was his father, whom he felt always held him at arm's length, a cheat, or something worse? Did his father hold the key to Tony's salvation? A little far-fetched, but this is a comic, right?

Don Cheadle is the foil to Tony's self-destructive downslide, and their friendship is strained by competing interests besides, one of whom is Gary Shandling's oily, bloated politician who is insisting that Stark turns over the suit to the US - actually an interesting point, since the question is, do we want to put all our eggs in Tony's basket? Shandling is cast as the ""bad"" guy of sorts, but it's a grey area and he gets a surprising dig in the end.

The effects are well done. There is mundo action and destruction, also touched with humor in the midst of terrifying threats. I felt some aspects of the pre-final battle were a little too easy, but it makes sense in terms of the major players (Hammer vs. Stark) and their companies as ""characters"", which is built up throughout the movie.

We have hints of the Avenger initiative, but not much - stay for the after-credits teaser, thin though it is.

Everything comes together and every part makes for a great time at the movies.",1273190400,5,3440,4.632183908045977
