Some 1 said what Die Hard for Christmas ... who knew ... yes a lot of the movies are dated ...but still fun to watch. movie 3 & 4 ... do not have his wife any longer in them like movie 1 & 2. movie 4 u see his daughter & Josh Duhamel. After all these movies, I am more of a Bruce Willis fan that ever. I remember him in Moonlighting, but I was such a little kid them. Oh and a positive kind note. I think Bruce is way sexier with no hair ...just saying. to all those folks who say bald is not sexy, it totally is. Rock what you got. ( ;",1515024000,8,642,3.592857142857143

All I wanted was the 1st 4 movies and this filled the void. I didn't care about any fancy bells & whistles included in other collections, so was a great buy. The widescreen movies look & sound GREAT, thanks to THX surround sound. I also like the way 4 DVDs are packaged in the slim box set, which can be filed neatly with my other DVDs. 5 STARS!",1452729600,2,505,4.163265306122449

6597757,4,B00MP2FFL0,I debated between this and the blu-ray set.  I ended up getting this b/c it was $9.99 at Best Buy and b/c reviews of the Blu-ray were mixed.  These days it seems the resolution on some blu-rays really isn't an upgrade.  I like the set.  It looks fine on my 65 inch tv.  Wish all the dvds also contained the unrated versions of the films but not a huge deal.,1452124800,2,357,4.042857142857143

Not so much me... but they are classic younger Bruce Willis action/adventure.  There is some language... but basically I personally would allow my older than 10 year old to watch... but that's a personal decision.  If you are a Bruce fan, this is a classic set at an excellent price.  I always update with any issues",1449014400,8,451,4.743589743589744

6597780,2,B00MP2FFL0,Great series of action films. A must have for any man cave. That said... Do not buy these if you are watching on a Macmini. My Mac won't even recognize that it's a disc. No error message. Nothing. Just spins about 90 secs then spits the dvd out. Be wary if you are watching on a computer.  If I were to rate the films themselves I'd give each of them a 5 star.

I don't know how the original DVD's were, but I know that the episodes were much clearer (sharper) than the ones broadcast on TV. I picked this set up and had a chance to watch all 4 movies over a 2-day period. Yes, there is a lot of language in the dialogue that gets bleeped out on network TV.

The first movie starts out with a young Bruce Willis (age 31) when it was first being filmed and then we see a 33-year old Bruce in the sequel. By the time the 3rd installment is out Bruce is now 36 but still in shape. Then when he's 48 the 4th film is released and he still has what it takes.

In the first two installments John & Holly appear to have a rough time but always find each other. By the 4th installment John is divorced and his daughter has no respect for him. We see that Lucy is a lot more like her father than she would have admitted.",1531612800,3,938,4.037634408602151
