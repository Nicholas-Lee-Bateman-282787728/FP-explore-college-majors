7878198,5,6304860501,"This Tape had some of Ric Flair's greatest matches which took most of the tape time 1hr 35min. It also had a few awesome interviews I wish it had more . Matches on the tape included vs Nikita Koloff , Barry Windham , Wahoo Mcdaniel , Jimmy Garvin , and a six man cage match with Ric Flair , Arn Anderson , and Ole Anderson VS Buzz Sawyer , the great Muta , and Dragon Master . My favorite part of the tape was the the Brad Armstrong interview that Ric Flair interupted and told Brad to take a hike Brad challenged Ric and Tully Blanchard and the Andersons came out taught Brad a lesson . WHoooo",984182400,,594,4.085470085470085
7878199,4,6304860501,"This video is a nostalgic look at the greatest & most sucessful sports entertainer in history,Ric Flair! Classic matches with Wahoo McDaniel,Barry Windham,Nikita Koloff & others are action packed. Interveiws & a 4  on 1 Horsemen attack on Brad Arm- strong make this tape a must for all  Nature Boy  fans. A cage match with Jimmy Garvin (7/11/87) is awesome. 4  instead 5 stars because of some fuzzy  footage,but still quite watchable.",960854400,2,434,4.972222222222222
