7986211,4,B00008OTXM,He absolutely loves this edition of girls gone wild he thinks snoop dog is hilarious!!! When he got it he was very happy!,1360627200,,121,4.304347826086956
7986212,1,B00008OTXM,"Well, leave it to Snoop to ruin the successful and fun GGW formula by walking through this like an imbecile and actually making a GGW tape that is boring. Looking more clueless and dumb than hip and bad, Snoop hogs waaay too much of this and when he does, he can at best mumble ""Girls Gone Wild"" a few too many times while he stands around draggin' on a cigar. He sure didn't look too excited about the girls, and that lack of enthusiasm ruins this DVD.

If this is your first GGW experience, don't waste your time; check out any of their other collections.",1107388800,12,557,4.304761904761905

7986214,3,B00008OTXM,"Girls Gone Wild brings you what you'd expect -- real women, and in a believable New Orleans setting.  But the camera spends way too much time on Snoop Dogg and not in a way that's at all interesting...",1063238400,11,201,4.2894736842105265
7986215,4,B00008OTXM,"I've seen several of the other girls gone wild dvd's, This one has snoop dogg as the host, he smokes alot of chronic and narrates most of the action. 90% is all flashing, there is about 2 girlongirl action scenes.. And 5 or 6 kitty shots..
They do a good job but i think the main seller for this one was ment to be snoop himself, and he's not my type of college chiq :)
Not a bust, Definantly a girls gone wild production. Check out Dorm room fantisies for the hardcore.
