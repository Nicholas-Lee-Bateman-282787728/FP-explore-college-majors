2419865,4,B000BITV4C,Some really funny slapstick chases in here.  The story is pretty pat but the energy is high.  We watched it while doing a puzzle and had to stop to laugh.,1416009600,,154,4.1
2419866,4,B000BITV4C,"Founded in 1993, Chandler, AZ. based AFA ENTERTAINMENT wholesales and retails PD motion pictures in both full and widescreen formats. Cover art is often repros of vintage movie posters. They also provide a transfer to DVD service for videotapes and 8mm home movies. Their film dubs offer no commentary, deleted scenes, subtitles or other bonus features. Quality of these unrestored transfers is based on condition of source material, which can vary from very good to only fair.

He also looks a bit like a young Jack Haley. This HAL ROACH comedy that was distributed by UNITED ARTISTS was one of their last before the company shifted almost completely to television production.

Although Tracy is good here, co-star Emory Parnell is absolutely outstanding. His coordination with complex physical ""business"" is really surprising. In one highlight, Tracy (as 'Dodo' Doubleday) gives his news editor boss 'Windy' Blake (Parnell) a cigar that was a gift to him (Dodo) from the office joker. Blake lights it, steams over some nonsense, slams his office door and the glass shatters. We see Blake glaring at the door from within his office and suddenly the cigar explodes, shredding into a perfect daisy pattern. Parnell's reaction makes this moment quite hilarious.

The story is straightforward--
Windy is being blackmailed by burlesque star Bubbles LaRue (Woodbury). He sends annoying future son-in-law Dodo to the theater with enough cash to buy LaRue's incriminating diary. While Dodo is visiting her dressing room, negotiations are interrupted by a knock at the door. He hides in the washroom so Bubbles can see who it is. A man with a pistol forces his way into her room and as Dodo cowers in the john, the unseen assailant kills Bubbles.

The balance is a frantic 'who's got the diary?' skirmish, with two bad guys, plus the cops and Windy, chasing Dodo all over the stage and wings during a show in progress. The audience thinks their struggles are part of the night's entertainment and have a fun time watching trouserless Dodo swing across the stage on a rope, plus other bits of physical comedy. This chaotic sequence is reminiscent of the climax of Buster Keaton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SPEAK-EASILY/dp/B00022LJ56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SPEAK EASILY</a>&nbsp;(1932).

Despite having fallen into obscurity, ""Here Comes Trouble"" is a little gem of a farce that's well worth seeing, thanks to a most able cast, a fast pace and some good sight gags.

2419881,4,B000BITV4C,"This movie was so dumb it was funny, I don't know how a movie with such a premise could get made. I laughed at the idea that the editor's daughter's boyfriend could ever be thought of as a reporter.",1470787200,,198,4.102564102564102
2419882,5,B000BITV4C,"A nice, short little comedy mystery.  More comedy than mystery, but some good, classic laughs.  A newspaper owner that is pushing for an end to the criminal element that has a stranglehold in their town, is pushed by his daughter to giving her boyfriend a promotion.  He's made a reporter on the crime beat, with funny results.  When the editor gets an offer for evidence that can bring the bad guys down, he sends the reporter down to get it, and things get complicated.  It all ends in a climax at a Vaudevillian theater.

At only 55 minutes, it's short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome (and left me wanting some more).  It's more of a comedy film than a mystery.  There are some moments that made me laugh out loud, like the bathroom scene and some of the climax.  The print isn't the best, but it's watchable.  If you like classic comedies, it's worth a watch.",1462838400,2,874,4.474683544303797

2419908,3,B000BITV4C,A average mildly amusing comedy up until the last 10 minutes where it really takes off into a wild frenzy chase during a burlesque show.
