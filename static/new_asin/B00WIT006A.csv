7132681,2,B00WIT006A,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW

This is a kids' film that combines ""Karate Kid"" with ""Bad News Bears"" inserting all the cliches. Beau Bridges had a short lived cameo as the dad of the fat kid. Former world champion Jimmy ""The Lightning Bolt'""Lee (Phillip Rhee- also wrote and directed) shows up at the Mid City club and helps out the fight team. He was out of the loop for a while as he was hit by a semi-truck saving the life of a 5 year old boy. But it gets worse. He beats up the neighborhood bullies by giving them wedgies. The group of misfits which include a fat kid, a girl, and a neighborhood bully (not called the Bad News Bears) end up fighting the evil ""Scorpions"" who dress in black, lead by a man that doesn't play fair...WOW! Didn't see that coming.

Now the part that surprised me and the real plot spoiler is that the competition ended in a tie and they had to have a dance-off to determine the winner.

It was very painful to sit through. This is a Saturday Morning film for the kids to watch while you go mow the lawn. Older kids you can make watch the film as punishment.",1436054400,5,1079,4.228155339805825
7132682,5,B00WIT006A,"I love the movie! Great acting from the kids and the coach. It was a very encouraging movie for those who feel like underdogs. I love the motto of the  underdogs: ""Take all the negatives and turn them into positives.""",1435449600,,217,4.425

7132686,5,B00WIT006A,"It's hard to find a karate movie that my family can enjoy. Usually the films are full of swear words or such violence that is not family friendly. Underdog kids, while not the best acting I've ever seen, certainly had a good story line and an important message for kids-You don't have to have the best to be the best and the attitude you have can and does affect your standing.",1462492800,,377,4.323943661971831

7132693,5,B00WIT006A,"This movie deserves more credit than some of the reviews give it. There are elements that it could do without.

7132699,2,B00WIT006A,"Imagine my delight when I found out that taekwondo maestro Phillip Rhee was returning to movies after a 17-year hiatus. The fact that it was for a family film only lightly dampened my enthusiasm, but that thudding noise you heard earlier today was the sound of my crest falling when I saw just how stinky of a picture this turned out to be. Underdog Kids is clearly Rhees passion project, and while I like the idea of a positive coming-of-age karate flick, it does far too many things wrong to endear anyone but very tolerant viewers.

The story: An ex-MMA champ (Rhee) coaches troubled inner-city youths en-route to a tournament which will pit them against the nefarious Beverly Hills Junior National Team.

Other reviewers have called it before me, and I concur that this a pretty obvious melding of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Karate-Kid/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Karate Kid</a>&nbsp;and Rhees own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best/dp/B0002O7XUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best</a>. I don't mind the mix, but the filmmakers have disappointingly decided to go the sappiest and most juvenile route with it that they could have. Whatever the movie has to offer in the way of inspirational life lessons has been dipped in schmaltz and covered in cheese, because one of the few things that can halt the relentlessly pitiful domestic stories of the kids and the hammy character-building of Captain Rhee is the asinine comedy. The highlight of the humor involves the chubby kid of the group winning a match by farting in an opponents face. (Note to director Rhee: Overweight children already have a hard enough time being labeled ""the fat kid,"" and being labeled ""the fat kid who farts"" is not empowering.)

To their credit, almost all of the featured children have some serious moves, and if placed in the hands of more ambitious directors, they could probably make one heck of an action movie. Most of the fights here aren't bad, but aside from the overuse of slow motion and occasionally choppy editing, the tone of the movie ensures that the magnitude of these scenes never rises above that of a bunch of kids fighting each other. Richard Norton, Don Wilson, Dan Inosanto, Benny Urquidez, and Jun Chong pop up briefly, but not only do they not fight, they don't even have any dialogue. Phillip Rhee himself only has one match, and I am 90% sure that hes been considerably stunt-doubled.

Im all for martial arts in the family medium, even when it goes against my expectations, but even if there are some kids over the age of eight who are up to sitting through this, I don't think their parents will be. As both a filmmaker and veteran of the golden era of low-budget karate movies, Phillip Rhee represents one of our best chances of seeing the style of yesteryear revived in the new millennium, but if Underdog Kids is a taste of what Rhee is interested in doing with his experience, I will be less interested in any future features he directs. Skip it.",1445472000,3,3094,5.169660678642715

7132710,4,B00WIT006A,"Very nice and refreshing treatment of often used story line.  The underdogs overcome huge obstacles with help and sacrifice from supportive adults.  Train with intensity, heart and spirit and in the end achieve victory.  Some very fresh and appealing faces in the cast of children, who are skilled martial artists.  And the sensei has the right mix of skill (talent) and compassion.  Tom Arnold is superb in another cameo role.

I loved it and you will too!",1440806400,,457,4.87012987012987

7132719,3,B00WIT006A,"Underdog  Kids was a good film to watch with the family.

The film borrows plot details from the Karate Kid. But it would be a far stretch to say this film is on the same level as the original classic. In it, Philip Rhee, is an ex MMA champion who was forced to leave the sport due to an injury. Apparently he was hit by a moving vehicle. In any case, he's ready to go back to competing for cash prizes, but nobody will back him. As his agent puts it,  he's too much of a liability  risk due to his run in with a truck.

The situation causes him to take a job training inner city kids in martial arts, until he can get a better gig in the future. The form he teaches is unspecified, but he mentions Karate and Taekwondo, among other styles. Over the course of the film, his team, The Underdogs, forms a rivalry with the top school in the region, the Scorpions. Several scenes of light training, character development and fights ensue, until the film reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well what can I say? This film makes a fair attempt at the genre, which was a family martial arts film. It does succeed at  drawing you in at some point, and it comes up with some interesting, if not fully developed, characters. But the main issue I had with the film was the numerous storylines. Underdog Kids is not like the Karate Kid. That film was about one student and one master, and a few extra characters on the side, who helped move the narrative forward. This film has too many characters to keep track of. As a result, we never get to care about any of them. There were also some ridiculous additions that were hard to buy into. Having a sponsor, that makes their team wear a Karate Kii with a hotdog pic on the back, as a form of advertisement for her roach coach, was a bit much. Nobody would do that to a group of kids. Not if they really cared about sponsoring them.

In any case, both of my kids take Taekwondo. So from a kid's perspective, this film is mildly entertaining. Fart jokes aside, it does give a decent message about turning something negative into something positive. However, the tournament was nothing like we see when my kids compete, except for maybe the individual sparring, which gets cut  short unfortunately. And the forms piece to music, at the end, was a classic Hollywood fabrication. The team that won the event, was not the best team by far. But again, you have to remember, this is a Hollywood movie, not real life. And Hollywood for kids on top of that. So as an adult watching, I just had to think, (OK, Whatever).

So in the end, this is not a terrible, family martial arts movie. It's just never going to be a martial arts classic. In no way does it touch the charm of the original Karate Kid, like the box claims. Neither does the Jayden Smith version for that matter. But Underdog Kids is a decent family film to view if you're kids are into martial arts, or if you just want some family fun in a fairly clean movie. 3 stars depending on how willing you are to let go of reality.",1437782400,2,3028,4.296491228070176
7132720,3,B00WIT006A,"This is a cross between best of the best ad the karate kid. The idea is awesome, the execution... I am sure if they had more money it would have been better. All in all, if you are a fan of 1980's styled martial art movies and enjoy a movie regardless of how predictable it's plot may be, this is a good film.",1437177600,4,309,3.9206349206349205

8713595,3,B00WIT006A,"Overall, the moral is okay.  However, nobody does all those flashy, spinning air kicks in tournaments.  Looks good in a movie, but not in the least effective in real fights.  In a real tournament, you would get annihilated in the air before you ever made one rotation.  I don't know if they have ""musical form competition"" either.  They didn't when I was training.  Again, katas and all that stuff looks impressive for demonstrations, but it's not practical.  Also, could they not find a younger actor than 73 year old Beau Bridges to play the father of a 12 year old?!  Ugh.",1502323200,,575,4.623762376237623
