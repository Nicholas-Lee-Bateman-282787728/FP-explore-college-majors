The DVD is exactly what it says it is - a well-conceived, well-designed and well-priced complete set of Clinton's state of the union speeches.",1192665600,,251,5.121951219512195
8092632,5,B000BTNKGQ,"My daughter ordered this video knowing my love of American history. She's a devoted Democrat, like her mother. I'm more the

conservative-independent type, having supported Ross Perot and more

recently Ralph Nader, though that's an upsetting story to have to tell. I didn't sit down to view this Clinton reel with a great deal of

anticipation, but I was knocked out by what I discovered, or

re-discovered, as it were. And as a family it was enjoyable to go over

the issues, as they still effect us today.

With my daughter at the computer checking the latest statistics, her

and her mother did quite a tag-team number on me.

Perhaps it's due to being exposed to the bumbling of George W. Bush for

the past six years, but boy could Clinton deliver.

He gave a death-defying talk the night of the impeachment hearings, and

his knack for boiling down issues and making the viewer want to listen

and learn is most uncommon. It's one I've rarely found in any

politician, even my all-time favorite, FDR.

I'd rate this a B, maybe even a B+ as it wasn't given the Michael Moore

treatment and includes everything start to finish.",1141689600,4,1132,4.646464646464646
8092633,5,B000BTNKGQ,"No political DVD library is complete without this title.

At nine and a half hours, it is hard to argue anything has been left out - though I challenge anyone to watch in a single sitting.

Vintage Productions have done a fabulous job with this DVD.  I only hope it is successful enough to ensure a Presidential State of the Union collection.",1137801600,2,342,4.483870967741935
8092634,5,B000BTNKGQ,"I enjoyed thoroughly the Vintage Clinton DVD. It was a present for my 20th birthday and I have watched it many times thus far.

The DVD came in the mail on time and I am one pleased customer.",1131926400,4,191,4.026315789473684
