8709884,5,B00VEUX3WM,"One of Franco's best; this blu ray by Severin could not look better.  A brilliant restoration that makes the Redemption blu rays of Franco take note.  I think it's a subtle joke on Franco's part that the Doctor that Soledad loves can't hold it together after a career crisis  He's got Soledad that worships the ground he walks on, and can't even find another way to make money and goes insane instead, neglecting Soledad; what a ridiculous man.",1467417600,2,444,4.666666666666667
8709885,1,B00VEUX3WM,"This is a pretty bad movie with lots of bad acting and very little nudity.  I can always overlook a dumb story and poor acting if there is plenty of nudity, but this film was a disappointment.",1457049600,,192,4.1891891891891895

The seller forgot to include the fetishized Special Edition case (it's not fair for a huge collectionist client)... so, I will buy the product again, obviously, in another store",1451347200,,261,5.093023255813954
8709887,5,B00VEUX3WM,"Jess Franco. Where do I start? How can a director turn films about zombies, vampires, diabolical doctors, and lots of lesbians into poetic, eerie, ambiguous, beautifully shot masterpieces? Some mysteries will never be solved and it really doesn't matter. The devoted are just glad that this mad genius made over 200 magical films to slobber over. And luckily we have Severin Films to bring us some of his classics, like She Kills in Ecstasy!

This film stars the beautiful Soledad Miranda (under the pseudonym Susann Korda) as the wife of Dr. Johnson (Fred Williams). The good doctor believes that his research testing experimental drugs on human embryos to basically try to help the human race become healthier and more resilient to environmental changes/dangers will change the world for the better. Unfortunately, the medical board (which consists of Ewa Strmberg, Paul Muller, Howard Vernon and Franco himself) thinks that Johnson's experiments are immoral and they take away his license to practice medicine. Johnson ends up going insane and his wife decides to get revenge on the board members by seducing and then killing them one by one.

She Killed in Ecstasy is a wild, erotic, gory and mesmerizing film. Soledad Miranda, who died tragically in a car accident shortly after filming this, is simply one of the most beautiful actresses ever captured on celluloid and her big brown eyes display so much emotion in this film that it is a shame she passed away so young. The rest of the cast (which are all regulars in Franco's films) play their parts well and the simple story leaves a lot of open space for atmosphere, which the director (billed this time as Frank Hollman) takes advantage of to no end. Close ups, purposely out of focus shots coming into focus, that huge house on the hill and many other Franco staples are all here and used to full effect. The new Severin Films blu ray release is quite a sight to behold. The picture is clear, subtitles easy to read and the funky music by Manfred Hbler and Siegfried Schwab sounds great. And as much as I loved the funky soundtrack, the ""classical music"" provided by one of my favorite Italian composers Bruno Nicolai beautifully adds to the moodiness and to Miranda's haunting performance. For fans of Jess Franco or cult, horror and exploitation films, She Killed in Ecstasy is a must own, especially this limited edition Blu Ray which comes with a bonus CD soundtrack disc of Manfred Hbler and Siegfried Schwab music from this film, Vampyros Lesbos and The Devil Came from Akasava!

8709890,4,B00VEUX3WM,"She Killed in Ecstasy is worth a look for Miranda's acting and the visceral beauty within the killings. Franco's direct approach to this tale of vengeance leaves little surprise but allows Miranda to flourish on-screen, nude and beautiful and also hauntingly bleak. He even manages to sneak in a lesbian scene with Ewa Stroemberg again. It's a well-paced thriller from Franco that includes enough blood and beauty to make up for its standard plotting.

This Blu-Ray from Severin comes loaded with features and makes for a worthy addition to your horror library.",1433808000,6,561,5.0978260869565215
8709891,4,B00VEUX3WM,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

The more of Jess Franco's films I watch, the more impressed I become.  The man had a true eye for cinema.  I would have loved to have seen some of his work when it was first released; I can only imagine the response it received.  SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY is considered one of Francos pinnacle works, and I can see why.  The film is an exotic, visual feast, and the story is rife with passion and drama.  If youve never experienced this film before, now is the time to give it a look.

The erotic overtones in this film are astounding, but they are not what make it so spectacular.  This is a revenge-thriller that allows actress Soledad Miranda to shine and display her superb acting abilities.  Ive read reviews where people didn't think she portrayed enough emotion in her films; I am the exact opposite.  I think she was destined to become a legendary star.

SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY is shot very well and is a perfect example of Francos unique style of cinema.  His use of contrasting colors in his set pieces and costumes help create the mood of his films.  Likewise, he has a great eye for lighting, which helps heighten the tone for each scene as well.

The acting is pretty good this time around, much better than in VAMPYROS LESBOS.  Miranda once again joins Ewa Stromberg onscreen, and she does a stellar job.  The rest of the cast is great, too, including Jess himself who portrays Dr. Donen.

The special effects are lacking, however, and the blood looks like ketchup.  I was disappointed there was not more of it, eitherespecially when Mirandas character slits throats and castrates the men.  I was expecting a veritable bloodbath.

Still, that is my only complaint about SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY.  Otherwise, its a heck of a film, and fans of Franco should consider this a must-have.  The Blu-ray picture looks great and the sound is perfect.  It is available now, so give it a look.",1433462400,13,1961,4.54
