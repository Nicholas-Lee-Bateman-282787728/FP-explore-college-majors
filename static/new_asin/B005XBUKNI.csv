8488569,5,B005XBUKNI,This is true manga in real life style. I loved the iconic manga moments that stood tall. If manga was to be in everyday life it would b close to this. The subtitles are a bit off now n then but that's OK for me. I've read some of the manga for this and it follows each other closely. I really enjoy it.,1416096000,,302,3.8095238095238093
