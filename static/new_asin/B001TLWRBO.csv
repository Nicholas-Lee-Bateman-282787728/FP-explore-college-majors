3792386,5,B001TLWRBO,This is a great movie. It contains a lot of violence along with comedy and romance. My husband and I loved the movie.,1248739200,,117,4.130434782608695
3792387,4,B001TLWRBO,"This movie is very good! I love the suspense and the thrills throughout, especially the flashback scenes. Songs are entertaining and good. Asin has given a very nice performance. Aamir, of course, is top class.

I enjoyed both the original Tamil and Hindi versions of this flick! Worth a watch on DVD!",1246838400,,301,4.788461538461538
3792388,5,B001TLWRBO,"The packaging is refreshing and not anything huge like Om Shanti Om. The special features are just different subjects on making the film(making the action, making the songs, etc.). They are pretty interesting, but I've seen most on TV. The deleted scenes don't make the story either clearer or vaguer.
The movie is amazing. You could check my 5 star review of the standard $20 Ghajini DVD.",1246579200,,389,4.82089552238806
3792389,5,B001TLWRBO,"I will at times watch movies made from all over the world.  Recently I have taken to watching some of the more recent Bollywood flicks.  Ghajini was a breathtaking movie.  I kind of enjoy the musical parts of the movie as they did tend to tie in well with the story line.  I loved the contrast between the Sanjay dating Kalpana and the Sanjay with the bad memory.  Aamir is a very wonderful actor. I was very impressed how he was able to carry the short term memory loss. The actor playing Ghajini was positively evil! A very very well done movie.  I have the sound track and love it. The movie was heart breaking in certain spots.  Having lost some I loved very much I could identify with Sanjays grief.

I think India has a lot to offer and this movie proves my point.  One final thing, I didn't realize it, but the movie was 3 hours long. Longer than the normal movies I am used to watching.  The happy part of this being I did not realize it was 3 hours until it was over and I happened to look at the clock.  The movie kept my attention completely!!

Well done!  I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to break out of the rut of Hollywood.",1246492800,29,1148,4.187214611872146
3792390,5,B001TLWRBO,"For so long I have wanted to review Ghajini, each time I put it off because I just cannot seem to find the right words to put down that would do justice to this movie. In one word, WOW! I have seen this movie 15 billion times (ok, tongue in cheek), no but for real I have seen it so many times I lost count. The 3 hours go by so fast for a weekend watch and I have the movie divided into mental sections that I watch every night until the movie is finished, only to start all over. Ghajini makes me laugh until my ribs ache and cry too. Oh and did I mention how my jaw drops at the last 15 minutes of the movie.

I'm sure you're aching to get to the crme of the crop, so I'll make it easy. A quick warning though, this is in no way the Hindi version of the movie Memento! The only thing the two movies have in common would be a protagonist with short term memory loss who carries a Polaroid camera with him everywhere to keep new memory, along with tattooed messages all over his body. Oh and I suppose they both share the loss of a loved one. Besides these, the two movies couldn't be any farther apart.

The movie starts out with a group of curious medical students looking for a real life case for their capstone project. They find one that seems really interesting, but are told it's a police case, which means they cannot study it, hence the opening into the life of Sanjay Singhania, the bald guy with scars running in different directions on his head. The sheer rage at which this guy murders his victim seems unrealistic and definitely uncalled-for. I found myself wincing as I watched these scenes. Anyway, one thing leads to the other, cops trail the murder evidence up to Sanjay's apartment and that's when we get a look at Sanjay's diary. The diary opens with the photograph of a remarkably good-looking man, which makes you wonder how such beauty is transformed into the monster we've seen so far. It is this story that made me laugh and cry. One thing it doesn't leave me with is the same wonder at if the rage in the opening is warranted or not. I'll let you be the judge of that since this is my opinion.

Aamir Khan is a delight to watch as always. He keeps getting better and looking fabulous. I love the song Guzarish so much but I'd only listen to the audio (and skip it in the actual movie) because Aamir is so fine and he shows off his bod so well (in the right places too!) that it makes a woman's head spin out of control...sigh. Yeah, so I skip it just so I'm not harboring some thoughts if you know what I mean :D ...  Asin, absolutely gorgeous lady, she fits in Kalpana's  role so well, as a matter of opinion, fitting so well might be an understatement. Check out her reaction when she couldn't find someone to double for her ""fiance"" at her company's New Year party (don't want to give too much away).  Or the first time she tells Sanjay how she met her ""fiance"". This is the part where I crack up so bad.

The only thing that I kept saying ""Nah...not possible to"" was the stylized fight sequence especially at the end of the movie. I kept thinking ""Short term memory loss doesn't make one the Terminator, or does it?"" Well, I enjoy the movie enough to overlook this. Seriously, have fun watching this movie, it's worth the watch.",1242950400,10,3259,4.255250403877222
3792391,5,B001TLWRBO,"Simply put one of India's finest films to come out in recent years! Thank God actors like Aamir Khan who take cinema seriously and always try new things to improve exist. People who criticize the film's ""South Indian"" style need to get a life and accept the fact that it's an excellent film! I liked the fact that it isn't your typical fairytale/fantasy film you would expect from Bollywood. I recommend it to everyone who appreciates a good movie.",1239148800,,448,4.6835443037974684
3792392,5,B001TLWRBO,"We need movies like these. It is better than Memento and the Tamil Ghajini. The action is superb, the direction is fantastic, and the songs are great.

3792393,5,B001TLWRBO,"In this movie, it is known how far one will go for love. Billionaire communication's mogul is attacked, loses his memory but remembers who he loves and who killed her.

3792397,5,B001TLWRBO,"Amir rocks, he rocks, he so ROCKS. Asin is innocently adorable and a genuine draw. Ridiculous rage and savage mayhem, obligatory song and dance numbers with inexplicable troops of random, plaid hot-pants clad white girls and sweeping distance shots with lots of industrial fans blowing (seriously, Bollywood; step it up!). Imbedded in these unfortunate but predictable flaws, a wonderful surprise - cutest love story ever! Finally, a heroine who does not mimic masculine aggression or wilt in annoying feminine frailty to survive and thrive. Favorite moment - the tandom step over the threshold of the new flat in exaggerated slow motion, and the way he's looking at her and she doesn't even notice. That glance is worth a million.
  I wonder why oh WHY does Hindi fashion sense shine with women's hair and makeup and beautiful traditional dress; but totally suck in men's fashion? What is with the weird, short sleeve dress shirts and sleeves rolled up for the corporate scene?! It's distractingly awkward! Spectacularly so during the enjoyable love song in the Yemeni desert when bare-chested men sporting various brightly colored, super effeminate scarves are the order of the day. The song is amazing, the two characters are tops, truly!
  BEST SONG & SCENE: Kaise Mujhe. Absolutely breath-taking juxtaposition of a focused business man boarding a private jet with his formal entourage as he has many times before, but this time we witness a man gratefully embracing a future never considered necessary, until now; sharing his life with someone who inspires his everything. It is an absolutely masterful scene, thankfully devoid of classic Hindi melodrama, rendered exquisite in it's ordinariness by the haunting music, chaste and plaintive lyrics and Amir's oh so brilliant subtlety. Favorite segment of Kaise Mujhe hands-down: approaches security at the airport, and the lyrics say: ""And once I believed that the Creator finds His urge no more, and then He created you"", sigh.",1426377600,,1982,5.223270440251572
3792398,5,B001TLWRBO,"I've watched this film a few times, the movie keeps you waiting for the next piece of the puzzle. Don't think I could really add anything pertinent. Other reviewers covered pretty much everything.

Well, except,  am I  the only one that wondered how drunk the translators were when they did the lyrics for the song ""Guzarish""? Seriously, were the Indian censors sleeping? Did the translators just want to know how much they could get away with?

When I first saw it, I had to back it up. More than once! I still giggle at the thought.",1423785600,2,534,4.53125
3792399,5,B001TLWRBO,"I watched this movie for  Aamir Khan only. When this movie began within the first 5 minutes I thought I wouldn't like it. This obviously tough guy beating the crap out of a man yet he has a 15 minute memory. This isn't what I wanted to see but then the real story line came in. Lies, Love, Forgiveness, Secrecy...I LOVED IT and he dances in it too. It had me sold.

I loved the fact that the reason why he has a 15 minute memory now is because he was trying to save the woman he loved. I also loved that the woman was a hero and kind hearted woman that just happened to tell a lie which eventually led to a series of events.",1412985600,2,624,3.9444444444444446

3792401,5,B001TLWRBO,"i bought this for my mother after we watched it on netflix instant..it's a 3 hour movie and ill bet you big money if you sit down and watch the first 2-3 minutes of it...you will be hooked and in it for the long haul...what exactly is the long haul...this movie is a reincarnation of the movie ""Memento"", now i've never seen that version, but I'm positive this one is 20x better...Bollywood is showing they have the talent that Hollywood has misplaced..

this movie takes you on one of the most movie, and heart touching rollercoasters of emotion....you've got intense fight scene/ chase action parts that rival Jet Li, Jason Statham (transporter) movies...and then it waves its hands in front of your face, you forget that, and now ur in the sweetest most endearingly comical love story you've ever heard...and then...tradgedy, and you don't even know what, but you just cant understand how the two stories coincide, you almost forget about the other story...and then...omg..it's just so good...

this movie rips your heart out of your chest...with both love...and action...it's almost confusing how good this movie is...but what you won't be confused about is how you feel at the end...and if you aren't crying laughing, and shaking ur head in awe at this movie by the end...like ""...wow...""..and don't get me wrong...im no chick flick lover...granted i love a good story, but i don't just reach for love stories...but this is different...ladies its a way to get ur man to DEFINITELY be into a love story...just watch it...it's just too darn good.

3792402,5,B001TLWRBO,Aamir has the best of his body and muscle shown in this movie Ghajini. Loved this movie and a truly versatile actor,1396742400,,115,4.2727272727272725
3792403,5,B001TLWRBO,"Draws you in and makes you care about the characters in a way that Western films can't match. An epic, all-around movie with action, mystery, suspense, and romance.",1395273600,,164,4.892857142857143

3792405,5,B001TLWRBO,"another excellent movie by Amir Khan. this one is a much darker movie, based on a lovers revenge for torturing his fiancee. This is not a gory movie. Nonetheless, it is well performed.",1385596800,,184,4.606060606060606

3792407,5,B001TLWRBO,So I had seen it a while back on a movie channel but only caught the ending so I never did caught the whole story but either way it drew me into seeing it. It took me years to track the movie down because I didn't know what type of genre it was but I couldn't forget the word Ghajini! Excellent movie,1362441600,,300,3.8548387096774195
3792408,4,B001TLWRBO,"You will either love or hate this movie, or as a friend of mine said, both!  It is extremely violent--I fast forwarded those parts--and typical Bollywood--beautiful dance numbers (even after a brutally violent scene)--with an insipid love story (no one is that naive).  But the story is compelling, and you keep watching to see how it plays out.  Some interesting camera work and editing.",1360627200,,388,5.03125
3792409,5,B001TLWRBO,This is the Tamil version and forerunner to the 2008 Hindi 'Ghajini' movie. There is even more violence in this one than in the 2008 version. Asin stars in both movies and the plots are about the same. The songs are great and also different in the two versions. I have a slight preference for the Tamil version since it came first.,1357344000,,331,4.354838709677419
3792410,4,B001TLWRBO,I was told about this movie from a friend and when i watched it i just had to have it. Its a good movie and the dvd that i got was good and did not have any problems with it.,1349827200,,174,3.375
3792411,4,B001TLWRBO,"""Ghajini"" is a very intense thriller. The hero's fiance is killed by mobsters. The hero suffers brain damage from the attack and can only remember the last fifteen minutes. He constantly makes notes to himself as he tracks down the mobster. The hero is played by Aamir Khan who starred as the kind nice teacher in ""Taare Zameen Par,"" which also he directed. The movie is well done, but violent.  Not your typically Bollywood movie.",1349222400,,431,4.746666666666667
3792412,5,B001TLWRBO,"This movie certainly has many twists, from action to musicals, to the heartfelt love story that it might be odd to anyone new to Bollywood, but trust me you'll see why this was the highest grossing movie in India. Amir Kahn gave an excellent perfomance also the music and dancing were fun to watch. Yea sure people often compare this to Momento, but hey if you liked Momento then you'll definitely like this as well.  As for the dvd itself, it was in perfect condition, and the extras were decent. Literally go out and see this, then go back to Amazon and buy this dvd!!",1340755200,,570,4.428571428571429

3792414,5,B001TLWRBO,This movie was a  testimonial of Aamir Khan's wonderful talent! A beautiful romance well crafted and a stirring story. The songs were exquisite I liked Bekha and Guzarish. I saw Memento a week before I saw this and really believe this is the better told story of the two. Aamir Khan is very convincing in his portrayal . His dancing is fun too.,1331164800,,344,4.4603174603174605
3792415,5,B001TLWRBO,Very heart-touching movie. A must see. It is a long movie (3 hrs) but you don't want to stand up from your chair. Love it !!!,1327881600,,125,3.8461538461538463
3792416,5,B001TLWRBO,"This is my first movie of Amir Khan. I just want to say it was a superb movie. He played the character role so well, not only it is so thrilling to watch every moment of the movie, I really enjoyed it. The story and sequence is so well played. Amir Khan is a good actor. This particular role suit him well. Wish him all the best...",1327622400,,331,3.955223880597015
3792417,5,B001TLWRBO,"You will see a different side to Aamir in this movie. What a transformation! He worked out a whole year to get that amazing body. He delivers an amazing performance as a man suffering from short-term memory loss out for revenge on Ghajini, the man responsible for his condition. The music is wonderful because it is composed by the brillant A.R Rahman. Overall, I am well pleased with this movie. It is action packed, with good music and some romance.",1325030400,,451,4.65
3792418,5,B001TLWRBO,This movie is fantastic. It had me feeling happy and outraged at the same time. The plot is riveting. I also like to view non American films to see the different ideas presented by the film makers.,1323475200,,197,4.351351351351352
3792419,5,B001TLWRBO,"Of course, Aamir's acting is certainly not as good as Surya's, and in his own words, he had a supremely tough time getting Surya out of his mind since he made the mistake of watching the Tamil version before embarking on this project. Surya is a bloody good actor and it is tough to live up to standards he sets.

But whether you like the movie/storyline/acting or not, just buy the dvd for the songs. The songs are awesome. ARR scores once again.

Though the storyline is basically borrowed from Memento, it is very Indianized, with a lot of good humour and really emotional, touching scenes, like the ones with the blind man and the disabled kids. These small things melt the audience's hearts and make them better people without them realizing it.

Buy the movie. It's worth it.",1317859200,,781,4.60431654676259
3792420,5,B001TLWRBO,"Although known as an Amir Khan vehicle, the one thing about Ghajini that disappoints is Amir Khan's performance. It is way too over the top, and we often see him angry when he gurns for the camera.

That said, although a remake of Memento, Ghajini is a nice film with a strong - and long - story.

Jiah Khan is also in the film in a support role and is as gorgeous as ever, her acting is a little week but she has improved since this film was released.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see a well made Bollywood film.",1307404800,,531,4.086538461538462
3792421,1,B001TLWRBO,The vender sent the product quickly. This DVD is not formatted to american DVD players. My daughter purchased DVD's in India that were supposed to work in the US. They were not formatted for this country either. Now we have wasted even more money.,1295740800,,247,4.636363636363637
3792422,5,B001TLWRBO,"Ghajini is a great movie, with an excellent story! The acting is well done too, and most of the songs sound beautiful (my favorite is ""Guzarish""). Something that happened towards the end of the movie was completely unrealistic...I don't want to spoil that part for you, but I'm just letting you know. However, that scene didn't ruin the movie for me, and I still loved Ghajini.

And by the way, I've seen Memento. This movie is NOT a play-by-play remake of Memento*. It's true that in both films, the men have a special type of amnesia, they're after their significant other's murderer, and they take Polaroid photos to remember situations. But the plot is otherwise completely different. Memento is a thriller and Ghajini is full of action and romance. The romance in this movie is actually really sweet, and I don't say that about most romantic movies.

*Ghajini is, however, a remake of a movie with the same name released in Tamil, another Indian language. I haven't seen that one yet, though, so I can't comment on whether it's better or not.",1293062400,,1047,4.747252747252747
3792423,5,B001TLWRBO,"This movie sums up Amir Khan to me, the consumate actor forever evolving.  If for nothing, the dedication this man gave for over a year just to fit the character is almost unbelievable.  However, after watching the ""making of"" which is included in this DVD, I was amazed.  Amir Khan is more than amazing in this movie, the story was brilliant, cleverly weaving in and out of flashbacks, the music was just haunting especially ""guzarish"", goes without saying A.R. Rahman is a musical genius.  Overall, I absolutely enjoyed this movie, even though violent in some places, but Amir was totally convincing.  He should have got every award for this movie, loved it and bought it, will watch it again and again.",1289260800,2,705,4.793388429752066
3792424,5,B001TLWRBO,"This movie turned me on to Aamir Khan though I've seen him in other movies.  Not only is he ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS but he's such a gifted actor.  He makes you feel Sanjay's grief but also makes you laugh and go ""awwww"" in the scenes recounting Sanjay's relationship with Kalpana.  Asin, who plays Kaplana is great in this movie as well.  There are so many funny moments and those that make you cry too.  It's got action for the guys and romance for the ladies.  Highly recommended for all Bollywood fans and those wanting to check it out.",1269561600,,535,4.463917525773196

It was sort of by accident because I was checking the guide and read the description and became curious because it sounded exactly like a description of the movie Momento (EXCELLENT movie, by the way!!!).  So, I decided to check it out.  I was NOT at all disappointed!  This movie is so incredibly executed and brilliantly acted out.  I was literally on the edge of my seat during most of the movie!  What an amazingly genius potrayal by lead actor Aamir Khan!!!  Brilliant!  I can't say enough about this movie.  This Christmas, I bought two copies.....one for myself and one for my dad.

You will not find this DVD in stores so online, especially on Amazon, is gonna be the best deal you will get. I think.... anyways. I'm not too sure what to call them but there are a lot of songs, like musicals in the movie. I would say about five. This deters a lot of my friends. The reason why i gave this 4 stars is because throughout the movie in the upper right corner there's a little title that says Big Home Video. It appears every now and then and stays for a few minutes. I don't know if this is common practice among Indian films or it might just be that specific company. I should have researched this before i bought it because it tends to bug me, especially when it happens over the course of a three hour long movie. It did not decrease the quality of the movie. For all of you out there wanting to try a good Indian film this is a good place to start. I tend to like foreign films much more than Hollywood films. Hollywood is really predictable, ect.... well I'm not a movie buff so i should shut it right about now. Hope you guys enjoy the movie.",1258416000,,1222,4.117154811715481

If I had to leave the room I hit pause and rush right back to it. The lead actors were very well matched. Amir played both sides of Sanjay so well, I had a difficult time remembering he was the same actor. Asin was too endearing for words with a smile to match.
I'm not use to the films from India with musical interludes, but in this film it demonstrated very well what the lead characters were feeling. It reminded me of the 1966 French film A man and a woman were musical interludes were used to enchance the feelings of love between the characters. Awesome film, but I would love to be able look at the film and not have to read the film. BUT, I will watch it again and read it again!",1250467200,,1138,4.666666666666667

We were very disappointed when we watched it. The story was implausible and unnecessarily violent. The actors did a good job and the music numbers were good but the movie didn't work. It was like a comedy/love story and a violent drama got put together without enough effort made to connect them.",1249171200,3,485,4.574712643678161

8342033,5,B001TLWRBO,"Been trying to track this down for a while. Great love story/Action movie, regardless that it is a foreign flick. Subtitles don't interfere and music and dancing is at a minimum, and actually pushes the plot along. This was the director's second attempt at this movie - better cast, better action, better everything.",1487548800,,316,4.981132075471698

8342035,5,B001TLWRBO,"I thought I would never watch this film.  Then I saw it and vowed I would never watch it again.  Then I bought it, and now I want everyone to watch it.
Once again, Aamir Khan has given us an impossible character in an amazing story.  How can he do it?  By sheer hard work motivated by enormous talent and an endless understanding of his character and all characters.
It is beyond my words to describe, except to say he is an exceptional actor who creates unforgettable films.  Don't think you know this film from the posters.  There is nothing predictable or derivative about it.
Thank you, Master Aamir.",1453161600,,604,4.495412844036697

8342037,5,B001TLWRBO,"One of the most popular action movie of all, I loved it, AmirKhan is the most popular around the world.",1448841600,,103,4.2
8342038,5,B001TLWRBO,"Aamir Khan as Sanjay Singhania paired with Asin as Kalpana: the beauty and chemistry of these lovers is beyond compare. Captivating, though very violent story. The setup of learning about the short term memory loss and flash back through the diary keeps the viewer engaged in the story. Filled with great songs: Bekah and Guzaarish are among my all time favorites. This is Aamir Khan at the top of his game (physically as well) and I like this movie just a tiddly bit more than 3 Idiots, PK or Dhoom 3, my other AK favorites.",1447027200,,525,4.536842105263158
