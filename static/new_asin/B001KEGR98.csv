3664618,5,B001KEGR98,This item arrived in perfect condition!  It's wonderful because Mr. Humperdinck talks in interview about each song and what was going on in his career at each point before playing the clips of the performances.,1303430400,5,210,5.0
3664619,5,B001KEGR98,"This is a totally amazing, fantastic DVD to own.  His commentary is so great before each song that even if you've been a fan for a long time, you learn things you didn't know before.  You find yourself  wanting this to go on forever, and it takes you back to the days when he was on TV.  We couldn't wait for Wednesday to roll around each week so that we could see him again and now I own part of the show. It's incredible!  I loved this so much!
Thank you, Enge for doing this for your fans!",1264636800,7,492,3.979591836734694
3664620,3,B001KEGR98,"After just now discovering the talent of Engelbert, i am playing catch up. This DVD is like a walk back in time to the days when he sang on variety and talk shows. Most of the footage are almost carbon copies of each other where he walks out and stands there and sings (beautifully) his latest release. While this is not the best of the Engelbert DVDs (Engelbert Live...is) it still is a great walk down memory lane, back to when singers could actually sing and were not electronically enhanced and manufactured.",1263168000,10,512,4.576086956521739
3664621,5,B001KEGR98,Great footage of classic performances. What makes this even better is that Enge gives commentary before every song. His sense of humor shines through.,1245801600,11,150,5.291666666666667
3664635,5,B001KEGR98,I have been listening to his music for most of my life and I have introduced friends to listen to his Dvd's and they also like him.,1388361600,,131,3.888888888888889
3664636,5,B001KEGR98,"As a lifelong fan of the Eng, all I can say is this is one fantastic dvd of his classic hits. To see him performing in his early days is such a thrill! Especially after just recently seeing him live! I loved his introductions to each song and the stories that he told throughout the dvd. A definite ""must have"" for any fan! So happy I bought it. It's hard to wear out a dvd, but I'm so gonna try! ;)",1378857600,,399,3.9382716049382718
3664637,5,B001KEGR98,My mother is a huge fan of the Humperdink and she absolutely loved this video.  She said way better than the cheesy ones on YouTube.,1371513600,,132,4.28

3664640,5,B001KEGR98,I really liked this item because it had Engelbert's best songs on it.  I'd recommend it to any female of any age that really likes romance.  Engelbert really is the King of Romance!  No one beats him!  Buy it and fall in love!,1359331200,2,226,4.186046511627907
3664641,5,B001KEGR98,"I always liked Engelbert Humperdinck, and listening other music CD's, I decited, this would be a perfect gift for my European friends.",1354924800,,134,5.136363636363637
3664642,4,B001KEGR98,"Although this isn't a DVD I will play as often as I play some of my other Engelbert DVD's, I really enjoy watching it.  I love listening to the songs the way they were originally recorded.  It is fun looking back on his first stage appearances and being able to compare them with his more recent ones.  And, although his voice is probably at its peak during these performances, his stage appeal and comfort on stage are more apparent in his later years. This is a great DVD to add to your collection.",1352764800,,500,4.354838709677419
3664643,5,B001KEGR98,"A great video. Memories of his hits. I enjoy the old footage. Great song writing, great arrangements, beautiful singing. Back to a time of romance.  Engelbert gives a good commentary. I saw him a few years ago, live in Las Vegas at the Orleans.  He still puts on a great show, the voice is still there.  A fun, entertaining, warm person. Bravo!",1314576000,3,344,4.516129032258065
