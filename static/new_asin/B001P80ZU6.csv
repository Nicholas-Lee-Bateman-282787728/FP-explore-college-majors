8332488,4,B001P80ZU6,"PLOT: Cipher Code Breakers break up a spy ring.

1938....the Cipher Code Bureau....follows the clues to a wireless radio transmission and they get away. Immediately the spies change to a new code. Major Phillip Waring (Leon Ames)  the head Code Breaker and his secretary Lane...start in and crack the ""new code"".....Waring's younger brother gets drug into the spy ring when they steal secret Navy Codes....and they soon track the wireless transmission to Tennessee and capture a second arm of the spy ring. We see the way the spies choose to broadcast the code in a radio transmission. This is quiet good my only comment is the video I got had plenty of break ups on the video copy. But worth the purchase and watch I give it 4 out of 5 for good spy catcher fun. FOLLOW UP MOVIE IS : PANAMA PATROL with the same couple of WARING AND LANE.",1394928000,,838,4.543046357615894
8332489,4,B001P80ZU6,"The movie scren play  was written by my grandfather, and his son (my father) always said it was his best movie. It was shown often on TV in the 50s, but disappeared for decades. It was only by happenstance that I found it on Amazon. The overall video quality is poor - it looks like the company offering it made a copy of a copy.

My family enjoyed watching it, knowing of course the family tie. My grandfather's most famous screen play is ""Reefer Madness"", a horrible film, and one he did to put food on the table in hard times.
