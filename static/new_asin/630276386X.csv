508704,5,630276386X,"A film you may never have heard of, but really should see. Trust me. If you grew up at the movies, like I did, this film is a slam-dunk. You went to the shows and devoured films like ""It, The Terror From Beyond Space,"" & ""Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers."" The kid in this film is you (or me) and Lawrence Woolsey played by John Goodman is the guy who gave us our favorite junk movies. And add to that that it all takes place in Southern Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and you have a deliciously fun film(I see that look in your eye and you'll just have to trust me on this) Fine performances all around and Joe Dante (a heroically underappreciated director) directing. Goodman's character is based on real-life producer William Castle who was known as much for his stunts as his movies. He gave us ""The Tingler"" crawling under the seats of the audience, and on one film actually gave the audience mild shocks through wires in their seats. He also issued ""Death by Fright"" Insurance policies in the lobby, and had an actress dressed like a nurse on duty,
just in case you had a heart attack. It is all gloriously remembered here. They even lets us see portions of the film he's trying to sell. ""Half Man! Half Ant! He's Mant!"" You'll see a bunch of stars of the B-Movie heaven here, but I'll let you find them, that's the fun. Even the clever little send-up of Disney films of the '60's (""The Shook Up Shopping Cart,"" with dead Dad coming back as a shopping cart and trying to solve crimes.) would make this worth seeing. This is not an epic, this is just a great little find. My friends, you put the joy of movie hokem next to the true terror of a world on the edge of Nuclear war, and you have a little film that has a lot to say, but never forgets what it is, and what it is meant to do. Goodman's character sums it all up when he tells the teen hero: ""You think grown-ups have it all figured out? That's just a hustle, kid.
Grown-ups are making it up as they go along just like you. You remember that, and you'll do fine.""",1086825600,16,2032,4.253229974160207
508705,3,630276386X,"John Goodman plays a low-budget 1960's era filmmaker who goes out for pure schlock and decides that the Cuban missile crisis is the perfect time to release his latest sci-fi schlockbuster.  Actually, the flick is less about him than the pre-teens inhabiting the Florida town in which Goodman has chosen to debut his latest flick - a grade-Z epic called ""ManT"".  That's a shame because Goddman's brand of dead-pan delivery is probably the only thing this flick has going for it.  Goodman's character is probably inspired by the late-great William Castle, though he makes the role his own.  While Castle was an impressario (Castle was famous for stunts like putting low-power electrodes in seats of tehaters showing his ""The Tingler""; if you've ever seen ""Mr. Sardonicus"", Castle appears near the end asking viewers to decide the title character's fate, even though only one ending was actually filmed.) Goodman's character has fun looking dead-serious on film as he waves at us the respected technical journals that supposedly corroborate his ""chillingly plausible"" cautionary tale of a man being turned into a gigantic ant.  Unfortunately, the flick defeats this by showing us that Goodman really is an impressario, he doesn't believe his flicks, and he has to use his own stock actors to pose as protesters at his premieres (It's a move to supposedly bring in anti-censorship intellectuals who would otherwise never give ""ManT"" the time of day).  Also, the producers of ""Matinee"" look a bit behind the times themselves - grade-Z schlock like ""ManT"" sounds closer to 1957 than 1962, and you'd think that the beatniks who show up at ""ManT"" would have been smart enough to see through Goodman's show.  In the end, ""Matinee"" is good for a matinee",1062288000,,1743,5.03125
508706,5,630276386X,"Joe Dante, the evil mastermind behind ""Gremlins,"" makes a nostalgic film that is even more enjoyable than his classic monster flick.
In 1962 Key West, young teen Gene (Simon Fenton) and his brother sit in the dark theater and see previews for Lawrence Woolsey's (John Goodman) new film ""Mant,"" ""half man, half ant, all terror!"" Gene's father is absent, floating around in the Gulf of Mexico in the Cuban blockade. Everyone is nuclear-paranoid, as Gene's school holds atomic bomb drills. During one of these, cute Sandra (Lisa Jakub) rails against the silliness of the entire procedure, and catches the eye of Gene.
Being a naval base kid, Gene finds it hard to make friends. He does get to know Stan (Omri Katz), who is obsessed with pretty Sherry (Kellie Martin). Sherry has just ended a dangerous relationship with juvenile delinquent/poet Harvey (James Villemaire). With the threat of nuclear annihilation as a back drop, Gene gets involved with Woolsey when he comes to town with his leading lady Ruth (Cathy Moriarty). Woolsey welcomes the missile commotion, hoping to use it to his film's advantage. After Gene recognizes two of Woolsey's actors (Dick Miller and John Sayles) posing as outraged citizens trying to ""stop"" the film, the duo become friends.
Harvey threatens Stan for seeing Sherry. Harvey is then hired by Woolsey to both play a guy in a Mant suit, and to run all the backstage effects, including rumbling sounds and shock seats. The film wraps up at the premiere of ""Mant,"" as Woolsey and Ruth must deal with a crazed Harvey, who kidnaps Sherry. Gene and Sandra get locked in a bomb shelter by a high strung theater manager (Robert Picardo), but the film must go on (even if the balcony begins to collapse from overcrowding).
The script was written by Charlie Haas, and it is fantastic. Dante makes a great teen comedy that does not resort to any stupid, ""American Pie"" activities. Although I was not born until six years after this was set, I still felt nostalgic for those halcyon days of youth. Dante captures the life of a military kid very well, I have almost two decades of Air Force brat-dom to back up my expertise. Dante uses special effects sparingly, so when they do pop up (an atomic nightmare, Woolsey's film), they are brilliant.
John Goodman is wonderful as the William Castle-like Woolsey. I have yet to see him turn in a bad performance on the big screen, TV's ""Normal, Ohio"" is another matter. Cathy Moriarty is a riot as his put-upon love interest. There is a great running gag where she dresses as a nurse as part of the film's publicity stunt, and children come to her with real medical problems.
The young cast all do well. Stan and Sherry, and Gene and Sandra, and poor Harvey are teens like we rarely see onscreen anymore- they seem normal. The teen's parents are also refreshingly smart, and I was surprised by this as well.
""Matinee"" is one of those films I did not want to end when it did. I usually do not like TV series based on films, but I would have made an exception with this one. The film bombed (sorry) in the theater, so a sequel is not likely. I will be happy watching this again, however. It is funny, entertaining, and just plain great. I highly recommend it.
This is rated (PG) for mild gun violence, mild physical violence, some profanity, and some adult situations.",1022889600,5,3329,4.711835334476844
508707,5,630276386X,"Although not the funniest movie I have ever seen, it was a good one. I was surprised at the level of cursing in the movie since it was rated pg. I used this movie in a seventh grade reading class to compare literary elements to media elements and my students (for the most part) enjoyed it. It does a wonderful job showing the monster movie stereotype of the '50's and '60's. It also shows what happens when people make assumptions about people or situations where little is known. John Goodman as movie producer Woolsey is great and very believable. Some of the younger actors overdo it just a little but not to the point where it takes away from the movie.",1020556800,,658,4.446280991735537
508708,5,630276386X,"This movie really surprised me. It gets generally good reviews, but so do a lot of films these days that I don't think much of. So I wasn't expecting too much, not wanting to be disappointed again. Man, what a shock! ...Or should I say, Mant, what a shock!
What's best about Matinee is that it is pure unadulterated fun. Yes, the teen romances seem to drag at the beginning, but the storyline about the Cuban missile crisis, and your curiosity about just exactly what this John Goodman character is up to, have already established an underlying tension that sticks with you and holds your attention.
Your patience is rewarded, because when the long balyhooed Key West preview of ""Mant"" finally begins, this movie ROCKS! Yes, a lot of what happens in this flick is not exactly like things were in the early '60s, but who cares? Personally, I noticed several errors in dialog -- expressions being used that did not exist in 1962, but again, who cares! This comedy is fun, fun, fun and just keeps going and going, right up to the end of the world! (on screen, at least)
By the way, much is made of ""Mant,"" the movie within this movie, and rightfully so. It is almost as riveting as the main movie, which of course is ""Matinee."" Getting confused? -- look closely near the end and you will see a movie within a movie within a movie!!! This all gets very complicated, in a way, and there are several side stories going on too, but it all moves so fast and blends so well, you really don't mind, because no one in the movie knows what's going on either! It's just total chaotic entertainment.
I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. I like it so much, I bought a second copy as a backup. It's not Citizen Kane, but it's a ton of fun, and also rather charming in its own way, so it gets a rare five stars from me.",999734400,6,1817,4.347058823529411
508709,3,630276386X,"I only saw this movie because I wanted to see Kevin McCarthy, star of the original ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.""  Joe Dante's ""Matinee"" is basically a movie for kids.
Gene(Simon Fenton) and his younger brother Dennis(Jesse Lee) are growing up in Key West Florida during the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Their military officer father becomes actively involved in the crisis.  During this tense period, Gene becomes involved with Lawrence Woolsey(John Goodman), an over-the-top promoter of low-budget horror films.  Woolsey is presently trying to promote ""Mant,"" a movie about a man who gradually transforms into a giant ant.
""Matinee"" is basically a harmless kids' movie.  The movie effectively captures the look and feel of early-1960s America.  Dante seems to want to appeal to both baby boomers who were growing up during this era and teens of the 1990s, but he does a much better job of reaching out to the latter.  Most of the story's emphasis is placed on the adventures and experiences of the young teenage characters.  The film has some exciting moments.  John Goodman is passable as the do-anything-for-thrill movie promoter, but Cathy Moriarty is badly wasted as his girlfriend and assistant.  Thirteen years earlier, Moriarty was a stunning presence in Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" and it's a shame that she hasn't been offered more worthy projects.  Omri Katz(Young John Ross of TV's ""Dallas"") plays one of Fenton's classmates.  Kevin McCarthy briefly appears as an Army general in the movie within a movie.

508784,5,630276386X,"This is the kind of release we wish the major studios would give us all the time -- a beautiful transfer and plenty of supplemental material.

I've had the LV and two (I think) DVDs, but this one outclasses them. The main transfer appears to come from a near-perfect print, with (to be honest) overly high saturation, the color popping. (The supplemental materials have a more-natural saturation.) The image is sharp, and (depending on how you adjust your TV's ""motion"" settings) can be made a bit sharper, without the image looking like video.

The supplements vary in quality. Cathy Moriarty's interview isn't too revealing, but Joe Dante's tells us about the process the script went through until someone agreed to finance it. We also get a better understanding of why he directs children so well -- and how he got the adult actors to deliver ""bad"" performances. Movie geeks will get a kick out of learning how the costumes were created and operated. (And by the way -- Dr Grabow is a pipe brand. Look it up.)

The crown and glory, of course, is the complete ""Mant!"" sequence, shot in real B&W before the main filming started. The image quality is disappointing -- inferior to the same material in the composite film. Sharpness isn't as good, grays are muddy, and highlights are often burned out.

""Matinee"" comes close to needing a PG-13 rating. The poetry-spouting, near-psychotic Harvey Starkweather is named after Charles Starkweather, a serial killer of the late '50s. (Am I the only one who's noticed this?) At one point he grabs Sherry and threatens to slit her throat with a knife.

""Matinee"" is both a satire of bad movies, and of early-'60s social and political attitudes. As one reviewer said """"Part spoof, part nostalgia trip, and part primer in exploitation-pic ballyhoo, Matinee is a sweetly resonant little movie-lovers' movie"".

508786,5,630276386X,"This review is for the Collectors Edition of 'Matinee' released by Shout! Factory in January, 2018.

I'm giving this release 5 stars for the release which contains a large amount of extra content.
The movie itself has some issues which I'll go into below. I'm giving the movie just 3 stars. It is decent but not great. So if you just want to see the movie and don't care about the extra's be aware that this was not a commercially successful movie and it's intended audience was movie goers in the 50's and 60's. It is heavily influenced by not only 50's movies but movies by promotional legend, William Castle.

For those who don't have much knowledge in 60's horror, the main character played by John Goodman, Lawrence Woolsey, is based heavily on the producer and director William Castle. Among castles most famous movies are 'House on Haunted Hill,' 'The Tingler,' 'Mr. Sardonicus,' etc. He is famous for his extraordinary promotions and gimmicks. If you have any interest, look up a biography on him, it is quite amazing to read about the stuff he came up with. My favorite one....forcing movie goers to sign a waiver before watching the movie in case you died of fright!

PLOT/SUMMARY: The story is simple.....

Lawrence Woolsey (John Goodman) and his wife, are in Key West, Florida to promote his latest science fiction movie. He has been doing poorly and is hoping to stir up interest. He has booked a movie theater to show Mant!, a movie about a man who turns into a giant ant. It is 1962 and the theater is 90 miles away from Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
The story focuses on several high school kids who are planning on seeing the movie. One of the kids has a father who is out on ship blockading Cuba. Woolsey has hired a couple of goons (one of which is Dick Miller, a character actor who has appeared in an incredible amount of 'B' movies) to pretend to be outraged at the content of the movie despite having not seen it. Woolsey has planned numerous gimmicks for the showing of MANT!. Chaos ensues when the gimmicks are confused with a missile attack.

You have a little bit of teen dating drama and that's about it.

COMMENTS: Before watching this I had never seen this movie. About 5 or 6 years ago I became a big fan of 50's and 60's science fiction and watched over 200 movies from the time period (just about everything worth mentioning!) This includes all the William Castle movies. I have seen probably every movie that was featured on a movie poster or marketing material in the background throughout the movie.

I have mixed feelings about the main story itself. I think what Joe Dante did is excellent but I feel like it was missing something. It's as if this movie wasn't sure if it wanted to be a 'tribute' movie or a comedy or parody or some combination. I certainly 'get' just about all the references. What I wasn't so sure about was the comedy aspect. I expected this movie to be much funnier than what it is. Therein lies the problem. The material is taken very seriously and it takes place during one of the scariest times in our countries (if not the world) history. Which on the one hand is good but it's easy to see why this movie wasn't a success. If it had been funnier, it probably would have done better. From a marketing aspect this movie appeals to a younger crowd. Probably many people that watched this movie did not pick up on the historical aspect of it or understand the material being parodied.

The plot is very shallow and I can see how someone who is not a fan of old sci-fi would get bored in this movie. This was not the case with me because I was spending a lot of time examining the detail in the background. That said, I am a big fan of old sci-fi.

This movie could have been set anywhere. Even with the Cuban Missile Crisis going on. After all a missile could have struck anywhere in America and the movie theater shenanigans would have been the same.

Mant! is obviously influenced by several movies, most notably, 'The Fly', Them!, and 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.' There are many other references to other movies. According to Joe Dante, parts of the dialogue are exactly the same as from movies of the time period.

You really have to be a hardcore fan to pick up on a lot of the jokes. But if you are a huge fan of these movies then you will be rewarded and get a lot more out of it. For example, The general played by Kevin McCarthy of 'Invasion of the Body Snatcher' fame, is named General Ankrum. This is a reference to Morris Ankrum, a character actor who played a general in many early science fiction films.

While watching the extra's we learn that Joe Dante had his production people make the costume for the featured movie, MANT! using 1950's low budget technology. He instructed them to make it look as good as they could under the same constraints of the original production teams. He also told the actor's to 'don't act good.' In her interview Cathy Moriarty said she found it difficult to act 'bad.'

Naomi Watts has a bit part in 'MANT!'

The bomb drill held during high school hours is an accurate representation of the times.

RECOMMENDATIONS: If you are a fan of Joe Dante's movie then go ahead and pick this one up. Certainly you will want it if you are fan of William Castle or 50's science fiction.

I'm giving the movie only 2 1/2 to 3 stars. The extra's are 5 stars. The release if 5 stars because you would be very hard pressed to improve on what's here. There is just about everything you can think of.",1516233600,2,6432,4.444821731748727

Since Key West is closer to Cuba than the American mainland, the fearful residents are apt to sense an atomic attack even when none is pending.  The hubbub surrounding the Mant premiere matinee brims with comic possibilities -- especially when the audience is subjected to ""special effects"" like wired theater seats, a disgruntled young man in a Mant constume works too hard to terrify them, and the movie's vault has been converted into a fallout shelter.

Sometimes the numerous plot streams are almost lost among all the hubbub, but it's all in good fun and the performances are vivid.  Sci-fi/horror fans will enjoy seeing how ""Mant"" mimics the real sci-fi/horror movies of the era, right down to the gimmicks that go along with it (Woolseys main squeeze, played by Cathy Moriarty, includes a turn as a fake nurse in the theater lobby), and how much of producer William Castle is apparent in John Goodman's outsize portrayal of Lawrence Woolsey.  Watch for screen veterans like Jesse White, Lucinda Jenney and William Schallert, also some surprising faces in tiny roles, and see which up-and-coming kid stars you can still recognize today after nearly 25 years.  This budget DVD has no extras other than a brief trailer, but video quality is fine and the price is right.  Rated PG.

HALF MAN... HALF ANT... ALL TERROR! So says the advertising campaign for MANT!, the latest low-budget schlock-horror classic from cigar-chomping producer Lawrence Woolsey [John Goodman], who more than makes up for his films lack of production values by festooning them with gimmicks that would turn even William Castles film The Tingler green with envy.

But the most potent gimmick of all is accidental: Lawrence Woolsey schedules a sneak preview of Mant! in Key West, Florida, in October 1962, unaware that the Cuban missile crisis is about to flare up. Will the threat of genuine nuclear war distract the locals from the movie, or will they find it doubly terrifying?

Directed by the legendary Joe Dante, this delightful film isn't just an affectionate love-letter to the sci-fi and horror films that he grew up with in the 1950s and 1960s, its also a witty and intelligent exploration of the way that the most successful genre films worked by preying on the very real fears of their audiences about everything from Soviet satellite launches to atomic mutation.

Showman Lawrence Woolsey [John Goodman] introduces Key West, in a small coastal town to a unique movie experience and capitalises on the Cuban Missile crisis hysteria with a kitsch horror extravaganza combining film effects, stage props and an actor in rubber suit in this salute to the B-movie. Although MATINEE is set in October 1962, its other film within a film that is the family-oriented gimmick comedy The Shook-Up Shopping Cart, featuring an anthropomorphic shopping cart, is a reference to some colour Walt Disney comedies and the film features a then-unknown Naomi Watts.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: MATINEE [1993] is a hilarious and poetic chronicle of America's early 1960s and a beautiful declaration of love for cinema, by the immense prolific director Joe Dante. If there's one director who has paid dearly for his insolence towards the powerful Hollywood industry it is Joe Dante, whose name is often unknown to the general public at large and it is a totally real injustice. The man formerly protected by Steven Spielberg, who indeed staged a series of small film masterpieces that had a profound impact on children of the 1980s. Like the brilliant The Howling [1980] is now mainly known for horror film genre enthusiasts, especially like the explosive Indoor Adventure [1987] and the fantastic Gremlins [1984] that are now cult  films that remain for a whole generation of moviegoers. In reviewing these cult classic horror films, you can measure anyone born at a time when the typical ""family film"" was not synonymous with weakness and political incorrect scenario, but instead irreverence and fantasy. Because of Joe Dantes ability to infuse a real breath of fresh air with all his blockbuster films that he has had under his responsibility and direction, Joe Dante remains one of the most emblematic adventurous directors that we have been blessed with his type and style of genre filmmaking.

As to the film MATINEE [1993] it is October 1962 and an enterprising film promoter capitalises on the hysteria during the Cuban Missile Crisis, that is happening in the small seaside town of Key West in Florida and introduces the idea of live props and special effects at the local Key West cinema during the horror movie MANT! We meet Gene Loomis [Simon Fenton], a teenager, and his brother Dennis Loomis [Jesse Lee Soffer], who live on the military base in the area of Key West; their father, who is in the Navy, is on an urgent mission aboard a submarine. The country is in turmoil since the televised announcement of President John F. Kennedy explaining that Soviet missiles were spotted in Cuba and that the Communist offensive enemy is more than likely. It is in this climate of terror that the director and ""showman"" Lawrence Woolsey [John Goodman] is presenting his latest film attraction MANT! of changing a man into a giant ant, following a nuclear accident! Gene Loomis meets Lawrence Woolsey, who he greatly admires, and helps in the preparation of its dramatic effects in the cinema while around them, plus there is the nuclear threat that will amplify...the feeling that the end of the world is nigh? Joe Dante's MATINEE' is a beautiful film that is guaranteed to appeal to children and adults alike. At its heart, it is a great tribute to the 1950s and 1960s monster films, which Joe Dante admired as a child. It is also full of energy and enormously entertaining.

John F. Kennedy interrupts television sets across the nation to warn of the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba, and filmmaker Lawrence Woolsey decides to capitalise on the atmosphere of fear that is taking hold in Florida after the announcement. Lawrence Woolsey's latest film MANT! just happens to be about an ant-human like killer hybrid that attacks only after atom bomb the turns into this frightful creature. Where better to open a film like this than in a small town near Key West, Florida, with its military base and close proximity to an apparent atomic threat? In addition to bringing his film to Key West, Florida, Lawrence Woolsey decides to drum up even more publicity for his film by bringing along a couple of pals Herb Denning [Dick Miller] and Bob [John Sayles] who pretend to protest about Lawrence Woolsey film.

Ambitious exploitation director Lawrence Woolsey has just arrived in Key West where his latest film will have its premiere. Lawrence Woolsey is hoping for a warm reception and a big cheque from the owner Howard [Robert Picardo] the Theatre Manager of the local cinema that will hopefully save Lawrence Woolsey career, and possibly even his relationship with his beautiful mistress, Ruth Corday [Cathy Moriarty], who has grown tired of following him around the country. To hype up the film, Lawrence Woolsey has secretly brought in a few old friends to protest its amorality in front of the theatre. When people gather to see what all the fuss is all about, Lawrence Woolsey begins handing out free tickets to attend the screening to support Lawrence Woolseys film MANT!

Soon after, Lawrence Woolsey wires the theatre seats with buzzers, and hires a guy to dress like a monster Ant-Man and run amok inside the cinema once the film begins. Lawrence Woolsey wants the screening to be special so that people would want to see the film again, and again, and again and pay for it again, and again, and again. Meanwhile, Gene Loomis [Simon Fenton], who is obsessed with monster films, and cannot, believe that the director Lawrence Woolsey has come to Key West. Gene Loomis is so excited that he has almost forgotten about the fact that his father, a navy officer, has been sent to Cuba.

The film works because its characters are alive. There are so many of these feel-good films nowadays where the characters utter their lines and the viewer immediately feel that they are meaningless. In MATINEE, the lines are funny and awkward. They make sense because kids often say and do things that make perfect sense to them but not to us. The excited young kids also look genuinely excited when they enter the cinema because they know that the next two hours will be magical, even if the film was bad, like the one Lawrence Woolsey hypes up big time, we would see it again and again, because the atmosphere in the theatre was so special.

The film's serious side is also credible. With the world on a verge of a nuclear war, the adults look genuinely confused and scared. For a while, a few act as if everything is under control, but then they become paranoid, like everyone else. The script has this same sense of self-awareness, with Lawrence Woolsey pointing out ""scientific"" evidence to his audience and trying to emphasis the ""IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!"" aspect of his latest story. Just as much credit must be given to Charles S. Haas as to Joe Dante for this film's success as homage to the horror-corn of the past, since Charles Haas wrote the screenplay.

And what would a William Castle tribute/spoof be without a nod to his famous cinema gimmicks? In the case of Lawrence Woolsey's film MANT! and Lawrence Woolsey the director announces that the film will be accompanied by ""Atomovision."" Little buzzers are attached to the seats in the local theatre, just as they were for William Castle's The Tingler.' Attendees must sign a contract with a ""nurse"" in case they die during the screening. Lawrence Woolsey even shows up at the cinema and hands out free passes to his latest film to counteract the fake protest he created!

`MATINEE' is fun because of its seriousness to tell an extraordinary story, by its way to live a character in science fiction in an ultra-mundane, everyday world. The actors all play in making tons. We also understand, through MANT! shows how horror films were distilling their political discourse. For MANT! the ant is simply the foreign element that will slowly devour the soul of a brave American lambda. In a curious scene, military and scientific clash over how to fight the enemy, either by science that brings compassion either by arms. William Castle's influence is most apparent, though, and Joe Dante and Charles S. Haas clearly have all of the knowledge of and respect for William Castle's work required to pay tribute to it successfully. Even the duality of fright and silliness in William Castle's films is emphasised by MARINEE' with younger 8 year old brother Dennis Loomis becoming frequently scared during that MANT! preview in the opening, while Gene Loomis  acts aloof... but finds himself jumping, too, eventually.

As always with director Joe Dante, the cast is outstanding, starting with the young actors, all of a very high calibre and the supporting roles are no exception. Besides the presence of several faithful friends of the director, like the excellent Dick Miller and Robert Picardo in the lead, we note the performance of Cathy Moriarty, whose humour deadpan laugh scores at each of its replicas. Note also the brief appearance of the young Naomi Watts, who made her debut here in the MATINEE film. Regarding the hilarious Lawrence Woolsey producer, it is interpreted by the always great performance of John Goodman, who just created one of the best performances of his career, and a genuine cartoon character unto itself, as well as both a businessman, showman and great kid trapped in an adult body, it is the master of ceremonies of the most beautiful declarations of love that we have in the cinema that we get to see.

Note that in MATINEE' there is another film genre parody going on, this time it is a pastiche homage to family Walt Disney productions with Dean Jones in the early 1960s that Joe Dante also produced: The Shook-Up Shopping Cart. At that time, Walt Disney liked to animate objects with a human soul. Joe Dante imagined an old man reincarnated into supermarket trolley, which has the same slapstick humour, outrageous same direction, same stupid dialogue, but the female lead is held by a young unknown actress the then Naomi Watts. Note that in The Shook-Up Shopping Cart that we can see nuns walking down the street, figures that Joe Dante likes fit into all his films. So I consider MATINEE' is a must-see for all fans of the William Castle genre or for mid-century film buffs of any type. It is an extremely entertaining film in its own right, but is especially enjoyable for its homage to one of my favourite cult horror filmmakers William Castle, the king of the corn. But of course another part of making this fantastic film what it is, and the brilliant reflection of the period in the America psyche in the 1960s, is the awesome music of that era and here below is what you will hear throughout the film, enjoy!

Special Feature: ARROW VIDEO Presents Bit Parts! The Joe Dante Players [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [10:07] Here we have a brand new exclusive special feature with Director Joe Dante and his recurring regular cast members discuss their collaboration towards making the film MATINEE. Joe Dante talks a lot about his childhood and especially growing up watching lots of cartoons on the television. We also get inputs from the likes of Robert Picardo [Actor] recalling when first working with Joe Dante and has always loved working on all his films he has been involved with, and he also feels Joe Dante is a brilliant director. Archie Hahn [Actor] claims he would not have a film career were it not for being regularly cast by director Joe Dante. Belinda Balaski [Actress] reflects on the very different roles she gets as a character actor and would hate to be a big star, as the roles would be very limited. John Sayles [Actor] gives an idea what's required of a good day player and again enjoyed immensely working with Joe Dante, as he is a great director to work for. Dick Miller [Actor] in an extract from the enjoyable biographical documentary That Guy Dick Miller, and to this day still regards director Joe Dante as his favourite director and allowed him great freedom.

Special Feature: ARROW VIDEO Presents ATOMO-VISION! Making of MATINEE with John Hora and Marshall Harvey [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:04] Here again we have a brand new exclusive special feature with Cinematographer John Hora and Editor Marshall Harvey discuss the making of MATINEE, and especially working with Joe  Dante. Director of Photography John Hora and Editor Marshall Harvey look back at the making of the film MATINEE, and particularly the nature of their collaboration with Joe Dante. John Hora admits that he loves shooting period films but has only done two films, and revealingly explains how the camera angles become more stylised as the film progresses in order to ease the audience into the much wilder stuff you see in the film. Marshall Harvey meanwhile states that as an ex-editor himself, Joe Dante loves being in the editing room to help the process along and always shoots the film with the edit in mind. Marshall Harvey admits that working with Joe Dante in saying, ""Being an editor can be frustrating and fun, but on a Joe Dante movie it's mostly fun."" Again get to view some rare behind-the-scenes filming via a very basic video quality in the 1.37:1 aspect ratio. Director and Producer: Elijah Drenner. Producers: Francesco Simeoni and Michael Mackenzie. Cinematography: Elle Schneider.

Special Feature: Paranoia in Ant Vision [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [31:21] Here we have a discussion with director Joe Dante about making of the film MATINEE, and was originally produced for the 2011 French Blu-ray disc release by Carlotta films. Before the interview starts we get the following information ALLERTON FILMS Prsente PARANOA EN, FOURMI VISION, ou le PLAISIR Davoir PEUR. Entretian avec JOE DANTE. Ralis par MICHAEL HENRY WILSON. With this interview with Joe Dante is typically upbeat and is packed with interesting stories on the MATINEE film and its making. In this exclusive interview, Joe Dante talks about his cinematic influences and comes back on the genesis of the film, to suit many personal anecdotes. It's always the same joy to see and hear the director of Gremlins, tells us the about filming and the problematic genesis behind the film MATINEE, especially the process of writing, re-writing and securing European funding, which ultimately failed to materialise and is covered in some detail, but having agreed to pick up the tab, Universal Pictures executive Tom Pollock's first reaction to the finished film was apparently ""How am I going to sell this?"" Joe Dante is also sceptical about the film, especially in relation to the discovery of the American psyche paranoia in 1962 with bristling anecdotes, as well as being very critical, as usual on the modern world and the cinema of today. The influence of Joe Dante's own memories and favourite genre films of the period are given appropriate coverage, as is the decision to loosely base Lawrence Woolsey on William Castle and Joe Dante even has a copy of the densely packed instructions manual sent to cinema managers on how to rig up their venues with the seat-buzzing Percepto for screenings of the Vincent Price film The Tingler. You also get short clips of some of William Castles Black-and-White Theatrical Trailers, which Joe Dante thinks are totally brilliant and feels they are like mini films in themselves. Directed by Michael Henry Wilson [1946-2014] and was also into teaching film, writing about film, and to also turning to film production and screenwriting, and finally directing documentary films. His other passion was doing famous interviews like for instance with Martin Scorsese and Clint Eastwood.

Special Feature: Foreword by Joe Dante [2011] [1080p] 1.78:1] [6:18] Once again ALLERTON FILMS Prsente Une, PRFACE De JOE DANTE that was originally produced for the 2011 French Blu-ray disc release by Carlotta films and again mixes in clips from the trailer with the aforementioned Paranoia in Ant Vision piece. Joes Dante goes into more details about the scenario of the film MATINEE and his love of the 1960s period of Horror films and wanted his film to be homage to those genre style films. In his remarks, Joe Dante liked to say that it was not his work but that of Lawrence Woolsey.

Special Feature: MANT! [1993] [1080p] [1.85:1] [16:09] This is the full length black-and-white version of the film-with-in-a-film that features in the film MATINEE, and edited together in chronological order and uninterrupted by blank cutaways, which really brings home just how great a job Joe Dante and cinematographer John Hora did on emulating the look and tone of science-fiction B-movies of the period and is the true gift of this special Blu-ray. The film is portrayed by some iconic players from the past, Kevin McCarthy `Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and but wanted to use Robert Cornthwaite, one of the stars of `The Thing from Another World,' but was not available at the time and Joe Dante draws strength from its ultra-serious way of telling its story. Like the works that inspired it, especially with the film THEM! which was directed by Gordon Douglas, the various scientific exposes some big words to make about credible absurd premise: transformation after irradiation of a shoe salesman named Bill into a giant ant, and which obviously focuses children's fears of the film MATINEE at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. Joe Dante plays with sequences and stolen several time from other film dialogues and clips from other films of the same genre. It is hilarious seeing all the black-and-white parts of this particular film put together. There is one thing I think a lot of people will not notice especially in the scene in the street with the giant ant walking past the shop fronts, at one point you see the same scene in reverse, but if you look carefully at the shop front signs above the doors, the wording is in reverse. I was pleased to learn that this film-within-a-film was shot on monochrome film, and that Joe Dante's key instruction to the effects team was that they should not deliberately trash up the Mants head and creature, but make it look as good as they could for the sort of budget these films would have had in their day. If you look carefully you will see Dick Miller in the background when they fire the DDT insecticide nerve poison at the giant ant on the side of the buiding.

Special Feature: MANT! Trailer [1993] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:32] This is the Theatrical Trailer for Lawrence Woolsey's film MANT! and it also opens as a  masterpiece in itself which immediately echoes the nuclear threat. It is also a brilliant bit of pastiche that borrows footage from other genre B-movies, notably The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, and absolutely nails the graphical style of the titles and captions in saying ""Half Man. Half Ant. All Terror!"" and even includes an abrupt soundtrack splice-click at the end.

Special Feature: Original Electronic Press Kits [1993] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:26] This is a typical Electronic Press Kits, in other words a studio promotional film of the period in its mix of interviews, especially behind-the-scenes footage and some film clips from the film, all framed in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio and having a very videotape look. Keeping the illusion alive and Simon Fenton, who is originally from England, retains an American accent even in interview. Contributors include Joe Dante [Director], Simon Fenton [Actor] and Cathy Moriarty [Actress].

Special Feature: Behind-the-Scenes Footage [1993 [480i] [1.33:1] [8:21] Here we have a welcome selection of rare on-set behind-the-scenes video footage from director Joe Dante's personal archive of the shooting of four sequences from the film MATINEE. Unfortunately at certain scenes the sound quality is very poor.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [1993] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:27] Here you get to view 5 deleted single-shot sequences, including a nicely performed exchange between Gene and his mother. Right at the very end there's a single frame of something that looks distinctly unrelated, but overall you can see why these particular scenes were deleted, as they would have slowed up the pace of the film.

Theatrical Trailer [1993] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:55] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film MATINEE,' and is a lively and seductive sell that would have sent youngsters scurrying to the cinema. Unfortunately, this trailer must have been made for advertising on American television, as it was presented in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio.

PLUS: Beautiful Designed 20 page Booklet featuring new writing on the film MATINEE by David Jenkins and entitled What have you done for me?  On Joe Dantes MATINEE. It also includes Cast, Crew, About the Transfer, Production Credits and Special Thanks. It also has some wonderful colour images from the film. David Jenkins is the Editor for the celebrated film magazine Little White Lies, as well as discusses film in all its diverse guises with a growing audience of over 100,000 film-lovers. David Jenkins has written major features for all the best magazines in Britain, including Vogue, the Sunday Times Magazine, and Guardian Weekend magazine, GQ, Tatler, Vanity Fair, the Independent magazine, Time Out London, The Guardian and the Sight & Sound publication.

BONUS: Beautiful Designed Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Graham Humphreys. Graham Humphreys is a British illustrator and visual artist best known for producing film posters. During the 1980s, Graham Humphreys worked with Palace Pictures, producing publicity material for films including Dream Demon, Basket Case, The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, the Nightmare on Elm Street series, Phenomena and Santa Sangre.

Finally, I am a massive big fan of Joe Dante's film work, and of course I absolutely love MATINEE' and is an absolutely really wonderful charming brilliant film, and very big on the nostalgic theme genre of the 1960s period the film is set in, but it is also very original and very entertaining at the same time. The film also looks absolutely stunning on this Blu-ray disc. Joe Dante's MATINEE' is a brilliant re-watchable period piece film from beginning to end and I highly recommend this Blu-ray. Joe Dante also pays tribute to the great character of Lawrence Woosley, which of course pays homage by the inspirational filmmaker William Castle [1914  1977], the king of gimmicks, who invented in his 1950s films attractions, like plastic skeletons released over the heads of the audiences in the cinemas, vibrating chairs and other kitsch gimmicks. Joe Dante the director is a man who took pleasure in terrifying his audience and to eventually restore their comfort once the session is over. Joe Dante, is the ultimately lover of practical jokes, beautiful monsters and abundant imagination, but also the rejection of convention and austerity imposed adulthood and all the while gently making fun of his country. In the land of Joe Dante, nostalgia is king, and the satire is his servant. What is also beautiful about this Blu-ray release is the stunning beautiful designed cover that is printed both sides. When I first had this film on an NTSC LaserDisc, it has always been an all-time favourite film of mine. Then I moved onto a NTSC DVD, which was sort of okay, but now I have the ultimate edition in this stunning 1080p encoded Blu-ray disc adding MATINEE' to my Blu-ray collection is definitely the ONE to own. Very Highly Recommended!

MATINEE: Key West, Florida, 1962: The local movie house gears up for a special preview screening of ""Mant"" (""Half man! Half ant! All terror!""), producer Lawrence Woolsey's (Goodman) latest low-budget schlock shocker. Just Larry's luck that he shows up at the wrong moment in history to debut a thriller, as the entire country is on red alert, caught up in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Residents of Key West, only about a hundred miles from Cuba, expect atomic warheads to start raining down on them any minute--hardly the atmosphere in which people want to escape to the movies to be scared; they're frightened enough by reality. But Woolsey persists with his premiere, and teenaged Gene (Fenton) sets out to befriend the man behind his favorite flicks. No one counts on Murphy's Law, rather than martial law, being enforced during the packed premiere of the flick--or on the life-and-death disasters that mass hysteria can create on its own.

Right from the opening, a trailer for ""Mant,"" with its portentous tone, screaming females and cheesy effects, we know we're watching a movie that knows its Grade Z sci-fi. Only later do we discover that ""Matinee"" knows our heart as well. Bomb-age Barnum Woolsey, master of the ass-grabbing gimmick (""Filmed in Atomo-vision and Rumble Rama!""), might be full of hustle and bluster, but he's basically an OK Joe, and passes on his surprisingly insightful understanding of mass psychology to his young charge. Ice queen Cathy Moriarty is perfectly cast as Woolsey's jaded lady, and the film is filled with amusingly quirky characters and intertwining subplots. By continually overlapping reality and fantasy, it cleverly questions where one leaves off and the other begins--and the role that belief plays in the distinction. A sweet black comedy about teen traumas, the proper use of fear, nuclear madness--and giant ants.",1421971200,,2118,5.014204545454546

I think ""Matinee"" does a good job of recreating the early '60s in look and tone, and it shares something with the first ""Iron Man' movie: it brings the story up-to-speed quickly, instead of killing time with exposition.

'Matinee' is a great film that pays homage to 50's and 60's sci-fi monster films and is a very believable coming of age story. What really sets this film apart from so many others is the fact that this is a send up that still feels real! Having grown up in this era it was a treat to relive some of those great matinee experiences of my youth. They just don't make that kind of entertainment anymore!

The film is set in 1962-63 when there were plenty of war scares and bomb drills in school. The film is a lot of fun, but doesn't lose site if it's serious undertone. The monster film parodies are a blast and horror fans will certainly see the William Castle similarities in smartly crafted homage that is going to make any monster kid from this era smile. It's a great movie and nice to be transported back to a simpler time to when it wasn't so hard to entertain folks.

Woolsey has this new film Called ""Mant"" which he hopes will be a hit, so he opens the film in a small town and with the help of a kid obsessed with horror films and some wacky shock gimicks the film gets going. Great characters in this film like Woolsey's henchmen who pose as right wing conservatives who try to stop people from seeing ""Mant"",in a subtle attempt to hype up the film. The film shows what it was like growing up during that time the kids deal with adolesence,a local thug the film's villain and the cuban missile crisis. All this wackiness and a great ending almost blowing up the theater, ""Mant"" is hit for Woolsey, I wish they made films like that now. This is a great little gem of a film from 1993 and I really think this film is perfect for Halloween. Its not a horror film, but a film about a horror film. I gotta say this is Joe Dante's best film by far. The only thing no special features and no trailer. So take my advice give Matinee a whirl.",1350432000,4,1537,4.263698630136986

Hopefully Universal will pick up the ball they dropped and release it with all the extras on that version or, at the very least, license it out. The French Blu-ray is locked for Region B).

Joe Dante's ""Matinee"" combines all of his favorite elements in a combination coming of age story of Gene Loomis (British actor Simon Fenton who is perfect as a young American teen) set against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the premiere of schlock movie producer/director Lawrence Woolsey's (John Goodman)latest film ""Mant!"" about a man who turns into a giant ant. Woolsey travels to Florida just as the crisis breaks out bringing his latest film which uses a number of gimmicks to make his b-movie larger than life.

Dante's film deftly combines dialogue/situations from a variety of b-movies from the 1950's and early 1960's. The writing by Charles Haas does a good job of developing the characters and integrating a number of complex plot threads/themes into a fun film. Goodman's performance as Woolsey is positively delightful and Cathy Moriarty provides an excellent deadpan counterpoint to Goodman's larger-than-life performance of Goodman.

The only flaw with the film is that the film is so ambitious that some elements aren't quite as well developed as they could be for example the romance between Gene and Sandra (Lisa Jakub)but that's a minor flaw for me--I wish more film directors and films had such an ambitious story and was as daring and combining so many diverse elements into a fun film.

Woolsey clearly is based on horror movie b-movie producer William Castle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-William-Castle-Film-Collection-13-Frightened-Girls-13-Ghosts-Homicidal-Strait-Jacket-The-Old-Dark-House-Mr-Sardonicus-The-Tingler-Zotz/dp/B0024FAG3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The William Castle Film Collection (13 Frightened Girls / 13 Ghosts / Homicidal / Strait-Jacket / The Old Dark House / Mr. Sardonicus / The Tingler / Zotz!)</a>&nbsp;who made up in showmanship what his films lacked in quality. Castle was brilliant at promoting his films which played occupied ""Creature Features"" type local TV shows before in the 1960's-1980's before the explosion of cable.

""Matinee"" manages to be a delightful movie about a time that Dante clearly loves as well as accurately capturing the vibe of growing up in the early 1960's in America.

It took 17 years for this underappreciated film to finally arrive on DVD. While this edition lacks the extras one might expect (and Dante DID offer to provide the studio with extras that he had), the film receives a very nice transfer to DVD (let's hope that the Blu-ray when it arrives looks terrific as well).

Audio is strong as well with a nice multi-channel presentation.

The disappointing part of this release is the lack of effort that Universal put into the special features for this set. Dante's previous films all had commentary tracks and other generous extras that added to the experience of the film. I had the prevous laserdisc of this film and it had ""Mant!"" with the footage shot for the film-within-a-film put together so you could watch it uninterrupted. It wouldn't have hurt Universal to include this and provide a new transfer of these materials for DVD. Hopefully we'll see it sooner than later on a Blu-ray (although ""Matinee"" did so poorly in theaters partially due to the lack of muscle Universal exhibited to promote the film, partially because audiences probably weren't quite sure what to make of Dante's film so if we do get a Blu-ray release I suspect it'll be bare bones).

While I'm VERY disappointed with the effort Universal put into this release (particularly given that Dante would have provided extras if asked), I'm happy to have this fine film on a good looking DVD that trumps the laserdisc from over a decade ago.

This film was released in 1993 at it went unnoticed, grossing under $10 million. I can hardly believe it. It wasn't because this film is bad. No, as a matter of fact, I find it at least as enjoyable to watch as say, ""Groundhog Day"", and that grossed $70 Million in 93. No, this ""little"" film just got buried by one hit after another, as that year I was working the AMC Coral Ridge and Hollywood locations, and we blown away by the amount of ""prints"" we received, starting with w/ Jurassic Park, which launched DTS! There were at least 10 other major ""blockbusters"" that year, including, ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""The Pelican Brief"" just to name but a few.  Anyways, I Bought the LD ""Letterbox Edition"" that included the ""Special Featurette"", the ""movie within the movie"", ""Mant"" in ""Atomovision"" which puts ""You, the Audience, at Ground Zero"""", as our host, ""Lawrence Wooley"" aka, Goodman, the Screen's #1 Shock Expert and ""creator"" of b-movie sci-fi thrillers, brings his form of showmanship to the unsuspecting kids of 1962 Key West, Florida, and gives them ""a premiere they'll never forget.""

When I was in high-school, he hired me to work there, and, that was my 1st job. I would later go on to become a IATSE certified projectionist before I ""gave it up"".  This movie ""gets"" it. It's a movie about why we used to go to the movies. I may have just missed the world of backyard bomb shelters and missile attack drills, but the film's director, Joe Dante(of Gremlins), manages to make us understand the world of ""innocence"" kids living under the threat and fear of the nuclear bomb, and reminds us at the same time how we loved to go to the movies simply just be entertained.

509108,4,630276386X,"All or most of director Joe Dante's films can be considered fun popcorn movies, something that is for both the kids and the adults, for genre fans and for fans of film in general. Dante gained recognition with the huge hit Gremlins, which Steven Spielberg produced.

But in 1993, Dante decided to make a rather personal film, a pseudo-biography of filmmaker and 'shock-expert,' William Castle, renamed in the film 'Matinee' as Lawrence Woolsey (played with the perfect amount of schlock by John Goodman).

The story concerns Woolsey coming to Key West Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 promoting his new film, MANT. While Woolsey is busy promoting his cheapie, a young boy and his little brother have to deal with the fact that their world might end, and that their father, a Navy man, is out on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico on the front lines. The only way to deal with the stress is to escape- - and what better way is there to escape than to the movies?

This movie is excellent, remaining one of Joe Dante's best films, being a more biographical film of his life as well as William Castle. The only disappointment comes at the hands of Universal Studios, who has skimped on the extras here and it is a crime. Most Joe Dante releases have a documentary and a commentary, but Matinee, which also had a film-within-a-film in Mant, lacks all, including the extra 'complete' film of Mant. Joe Dante said that he was willing, but that Universal was not. Too bad! Hopefully Universal will correct this mistake with a future Blu Ray.",1315353600,5,1543,4.644688644688645

This is promoted as a John Goodman movie, but he is really a minor character who is on screen only about a third of the time. It is really about a kid who lives on a Navy base. And that kid is not very interesting. It's hard to say whose fault it is. He seems to sleepwalk through his role, but since he is given little to do or say, his lethargy may be due to the poor script. The plotting is essentially non-existent. It is billed as comedy, but there are few funny lines or comic situations. The movie does have an initial intriguing concept, that of coupling a scary monster movie with genuine cold war fears about real destruction. But neither the director nor the screenwriter knew what to do with it after that. The whole thing just wanders aimlessly with not much happening. Goodman does the best he can with poor material, but his talents are wasted here. It even fails on the nostalgia front, as there is little attempt to work in slang or music that would evoke the era.

509114,5,630276386X,"I love this little film and can really relate to the subject and timeframe covered.  The film takes place in Key West, Florida during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.  A new horror film produced by the King of Gimmicks Lawrence Woolsey is coming to town and the two main characters, 2 monster-loving brothers whose sailor father is off on a ship blockading Cuba, are quite excited, as well as all the other teenagers in town.  I won't give too much else away except to say that this captures the time period wonderfully.
I was 12 during the missile crisis, about the same age as most of the kids in the film.  I read Famous Monsters also and absolutely devoured the horror films of the real Master of Gimmicks, the great William Castle (who the Woolsey character played here by John Goodman represents.)  I saw the skeleton come down from the ceiling (Emergo) in House on Haunted Hill, received the insurance certificate from Lloyds of London insuring me from death from fright when I went with my father to see ""Macabre,"" voted to punish or show mercy to ""Mr Sardonicus"" and missed sitting in  the wired-seats for ""The Tingler.""  It is obvious that the writer of this film and the director, Joe Dante,shared the same warm memories for the Castle films that I did.  Along with The Howling, this is my favorite Dante film.
A few weeks ago the Film Forum in New York City ran a tribute to the films of William Castle.  I attended a double-feature of House on Haunted Hill and Mr. Sardonicus.  The following week, I went to see The Tingler and for the second time in the last 50 years missed sitting in the wired seats.  I had a great time, as well as the rest of the people there.  I also had a great time watching this wonderful little film again.  It is a shame Universal didn't bother to give us any extras (not even a trailer.)

'Matinee' is a great film that pays homage to 50's and 60's sci-fi monster films and also is a very believable coming of age story. What really sets this film apart from so many others is the fact that this is a send up that still feels real! Having grown up in this era it was a treat to relive some of those great matinee experiences of my youth. They just don't make that kind of entertainment anymore!

The film is set in 1962-63 when there were plenty of war scares and bomb drills in school. The film is a lot of fun, but doesn't lose site if it's serious undertone. The monster film parodies are a blast and this is going to make any monster kid from this era smile as you are transported back to a simpler time when it wasn't so hard to entertain folks.

If you're a fan of sci-fi monsters or coming of age films or even period pieces this is a must see. The DVD is OOP, but I recorded it from a movie channel this week, hopefully they will play it again. Look for it as its well worth the effort.",1254009600,2,1081,4.023255813953488
509178,5,630276386X,"I've been a fan of campy disaster movies my entire life. You know the genre: Giant radioactive ants attacking Los Angeles, huge asteroids racing toward Earth, monster storms threatening human civilization. Good clean fun.

Unfortunately, the biggest disaster of all -- global nuclear destruction --almost came true in October 1962. I was four years old at the time, living in a small Midwestern city with my parents and older sister. Now, all those years later, I can vaguely remember our family sitting around a huge black-and-white TV ""console,"" watching the news updates. ""Why don't WE have a bomb shelter?"" my sister demanded to know. Ah, the quiet joys of childhood...

History and imagination have a strange way of mixing together over time. Let's start with history: The Cuban Missile Crisis as power struggle was portrayed in two serious movies: ""The Missiles of October"" (1973) and the more recent film, ""Thirteen Days"" (2000). Both captured the immense tension gripping the planet as Kennedy and Khrushchev played chicken with the bomb.

In contrast, ""Matinee"" (released 1993) captures the pop culture side of the crisis - how ordinary people responded to the threat of annihilation based on pre-existing Hollywood stereotypes. Scriptwriter Charlie Haas deserves high marks for finding the humor in this otherwise horrific situation. (I'd give him an Oscar any day.)

The film centers on an over-the-hill movie producer named Woolsey, played to perfection by John Goodman. Woolsey travels to Key West in October 1962 to screen his latest schlock flick featuring atomic blasts, human mutation and B-movie cheesecake. A teenage boy named Simon, who knows everything about disaster movies, connects with Woolsey...and we're off!

Every character clich from the late 1950s and early `60s is paraded across the screen with delicious irony and humorous affection: The ""bad boy poet wannabe"" just out of reform school. The sexually curious girlfriend. The lonely military wife, whose husband is stationed on a ship off the coast of Cuba. The beatnik parents and their radical 9th-grade daughter. The paranoid movie theater owner with a worthless bomb shelter in the basement. And so on and so on.

Unlike cheap parody films such as ""Scary Movie,"" this film takes the pop culture stuff seriously. You can actually learn something about America from ""Matinee,"" while you simultaneously laugh your head off. The storyline is so perfectly crafted that even the most outrageous twists and turns seem to make perfect sense. Kudos as well to whoever selected the cast for this movie. I can't imagine a more delightful ensemble.

If you haven't yet seen ""Matinee,"" please set aside time soon for this masterwork of American filmmaking. Bravo!

509179,4,630276386X,I was living in Key West when this was filmed. I remember all the blocked streets and calls for extras. It's the kind of film you can watch with your kids and not cringe. It takes me back to the days when I was a kid going to see old Vincent Price films. Good family fare.,1246924800,,272,3.875
509180,5,630276386X,"My wife and I have set aside 6 to 8 movies that we put on when we just can't think of anything else to watch. These are the movies that are so special and such a delight to watch that we never seem to get tired of them. Matinee is one of those movies. There's something comfortable and familiar in Matinee. I love period films anyway, especially those that remind me of a time in my own life. And even in the midst of a potential nuclear conflict (the Cuban missle crisis) it still reminds me of a simpler time. I love the Key West setting, and all the main characters are fun and likable. But the best ""character"" of all is the B-movie that is the core of the characters adventures.  ""When a man, and an ant, are exposed to radiation simultaneously, the result is terrible indeed! The result is MANT!
I always feel better after watching Matinee. For me, it's literally therapeutic.",1198627200,3,882,4.378048780487805
509181,5,630276386X,"This has to be the most under-rated, under-valued and criminally under-seen film of all time. Funny, touching, nostalgic in a good way, a wonderful tribute to the very joy of film itself and, the clincher, a cast of kids that never get on your nerves.

John Goodman has never bettered his performance from this movie. If you love the movies, you'll love this film. See it; then see it again and again. It really is the undiscovered artistic masterpiece of the 20th Century. I look forward to this movie on HD-DVD.

Until 'Man Conquers Space' comes out, we have Matinee!",1196640000,4,569,4.68
509182,4,630276386X,"I felt that the advertising for this movie was somewhat misleading. I expected to see a film about John Goodman portraying a loose characterization of showman William Castle. Instead, the main focus of the film is a young boy, Gene Loomis, whose father is a soldier who is dispatched to active duty during the Cuban missile crisis, which is the time period in which this film is set. You have your typical coming-of-age themes revolving around Gene and his friends as they discover their own emerging adolescence, and this consists largely of tired material that has been done to death. However, I did like the scene where the character Sandra refuses to get down on the floor and put her hands behind her head during a civil defense drill, saying that ""duck and cover"" was useless. I actually remember doing these drills in elementary school back in the 60's.

Somewhat in the background we have John Goodman as old-fashioned showman Lawrence Woolsey, a vaudevillian stuck in the age of cinema who wants to put the show back in picture shows. He is tied into the film because Gene enjoys Woolsey's showmanship as a way to forget about the world around him which seems to be on the brink of self-destruction. Woolsey pulls such stunts as having his girlfriend (Cathy Moriarty) dress a a nurse and ask patrons to sign a waiver releasing Goodman's character from liability in case they die of fright during the movie. This is based on a similar stunt by William Castle and his movie ""Macabre"". Woolsey also wires the seats to produce a mild electric shock during a key moment in a film, which he labels ""Atomo-Vision.""  That antic is based on what William Castle did during the showing of ""The Tingler"". Then he rigs still another device to shake things up as buildings on the screen are tumbling and calls it ""Rumble-Rama."" Again, these are all very similar to the showman-like stunts of William Castle during the 50's and 60's.

The best part of the movie is when Woolsey comes up with an atomic-age  monster movie entitled ""Mant"" that is a composite of cheesy 50's horror films such as ""The Fly,""  and ""Them!"". ""Mant"" is about a mutant that is half-man and half-ant and is a total riot.  Woolsey's schlock merchant displays just the right mix of con-man materialism and childlike glee at his own bogus movie magic. It's too bad that Goodman's character and his showmanship weren't the main focus of the movie  - Goodman was truly born to play the part of Lawrence Woolsey. Perhaps the biggest joke of all is realizing that this movie cost about 100 times the budget of any of the old pictures being parodied.

Besides recognizing all of the silly rituals such as the civil defense drills that people have performed and always will perform in order to feel like they have some control in an uncontrollable situation - remember the run on duct tape and plastic sheeting four years ago? - this movie really made me wish that there was a William Castle collection on DVD. Some of Castle's films were not so bad, and some were so bad they were good - ""Macabre"" comes to mind - but all of them were memorable. But none of them outside of ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""The Tingler"", both starring Vincent Price, are ever on TV anymore.",1169164800,10,3228,4.660808435852372
509183,5,630276386X,"I really love this film. The bottom-line subject matter of the Cuban missile crisis is a catalyst, but the subject of the film is the innocence of youth and the reactions toward it, living in Key West, FL. The seriousness of that situation is alleviated when Goodman arrives, a film director of gimmicky horror films, a direct reference to William Castle. Director Joe Dante juxta-imposed the political and pop-culture idea with brilliance. This film never fails to entertain. Goodman is terrific, Cathy Moriarty is the best of all. Young Simon Fenton is great as the real star of the film. It's scary and fun and silly and ALL the things that make movies entertaining.",1097539200,3,669,4.87719298245614
509184,5,630276386X,"I was 12 years old during the Cuban Missle Crisis, in love with cheap, schlocky horror movies (ANYTHING with Vincent Price!), and had a subscription to ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"" Magazine, so, except for living in Florida (I lived in Hollywood - well - Los Angeles, the only place for a film fanatic to grow up) this could be my biography. When the boy is shown with monster magazines spread all over his bed, they're real magazines from the period, and I had every last blessed one of them! I also had the monster models in his bedroom. When he turns into a fount of movie minutia at lunch, he IS me at school lunch, the kid who knew the difference between William Castle and Roger Corman, who couldn't have mistaken Dick Miller, who knew every trivial fact about every trivial horror movie ever made, and who would share them all with anyone in earshot. This hilarious yet heartfelt movie pushed all my nostalgia buttons. Even now, I can say what's that poster for ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" doing in a 1962 movie theater when the film hadn't even been shot yet? I remember the panic in our local grocery store during the missle crisis, and it was exactly as Dante shows it in the film. It's my favorite John Goodman performance. He was born to play William Castle, aka ""Lawrence Woolsey"". This is Joe Dante at his best. Apparently he and I had the exact same childhood.",1095638400,49,1381,4.550200803212851

John Goodman is excellent, and the perfect actor for this part.  His supporting cast is excellent as well.  The movie begins somewhat derivative of other movies of this kind, but finds its own way quite quickly and is a most enjoyable journey.  None of the characters are overblown, and the dialogue is sparse but entertaining.
