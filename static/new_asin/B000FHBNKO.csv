8122606,5,B000FHBNKO,"I found this at a discount store for $1.00.  I watched it and was surprised at how much I liked it.  After that I went on Amazon and bought every DVD Digiview Entertainment put out on Skysurfer.  I have 20 episodes now.  Im guessing they are not going to release the last six.  I didn't watch this when it aired in the 90s but I think this cartoon is excellent.  Big fun and action packed episodes.  Their cars turn into flying boards.  It has the Power Ranger-esk sequences when they change to battle mode.  Each character has their own unique battle uniform.  I found some of them to be really silly in appearance but I still enjoyed it.  Really good action cartoon for the kids.  If you like action cartoons then you should buy this.  At this price they are basicly giving them away.
