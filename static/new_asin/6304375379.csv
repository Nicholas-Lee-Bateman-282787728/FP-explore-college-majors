7868897,3,6304375379,"Let me make this clear right from the start. ""The Birds II: Land's End"" is nowhere near being even slightly close to being considered as a possible good sequel to the original film ""The Birds"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. But I would say it is an OK movie with decent acting and directing and good action. Again nowhere close to comparing to the first movie but if you approach this with an open mind you might find it interesting to watch. The movie was a made for cable TV film so a production like this is not going to have a big budget or time to put together a first rate thriller that leaves  you on the edge of your seat the way the original movie did. But I think productionwise this movie does well with what they had to work with. One thing I would say is that this is really no sequel to the original film because this story line in ""Land's End"" doesn't pick up where the first movie ended. The only two things this movie has in common with Hitchcock's version is the bird attacks that just seem to occur without very much warning the way it did in ""The Birds"" and Tippi Hedren has a roll in the film. She is not playing the same character that she played in ""The Birds"" but it is a good performance nonetheless. It is worth to watch at least once. I am hoping in the meantime that someday someone will put this movie out on DVD.",1427241600,3,1341,4.1976744186046515

7868899,5,6304375379,"It figures. Something like this was bound to happen to me. After viewing all the reveiws off amazon, I was just a bit curious of The Birds II. It sounded exciting, but compared to everyone else's opinion, I seriously didn't think much of it. Somehow I predicted once I bought it, I would make a regret, but no. I actually liked it. To tell the truth, I make no regrets about buying it. I loved it, which is the problem. In B low-grade movies everyone else despises, I end up to be the one who breaks that chain. That's me of course. I suggest this movie to anyone who likes sequels to good movies. Not as good as the original, but good.

Ted and May Hocken (Brad Johnson, and Chelsea Field) and their daughters just want to get away from the normal world. Can you blame them after losing their son 5 years before? In the hopes of escaping their problems, they embark to Lands End, the part of small Gull island where the earth becomes water. It seems a quiet and boring start to what may seem like a nice summer. But things soon change. Unusual amounts of birds have been flocking around Lands End, and a few other small towns around the island. Birds people never even knew hung around the island. The Birds begin to do strange things. Ted is hit by a bird while doing a little painting, his daughters find a body with it's eyes pecked out, and a strange crow crashes through a window of their house. As this is happening, the birds began to mass in bigger groups, and once all hell breaks loose, there is no stopping them.

I have to agree that sequels do in fact need an ending. This should not have been called a sequel, but more of a follow up of the orginal masterpiece. Why bother making a sequel when there is no point. Just another part in the timeline. Maybe that's why the director went with ""Alan Smithee"". If he was that embarrased with the movie, why did he make it? I'm glad he did though, cause at least I liked it.

There are some pretty amazing shots in the movie with the birds including the fact that in most of the attack scenes except for the huge attack at the end, they used real birds. Some of the things they got the birds to do in this one were pretty amazing that they couldn't do in the orginal, for example, when the the Hockin family uses a boat to try and escape Gull Island, and when they go to hide underneath it, the birds begin to peck at the bottom of the boat, chewing holes in it. They actually showed the birds on top pecking right through. I thought that was pretty cool, and a lot of the superimposed Alfred Hitchcock inspired shots of the birds look pretty real compared to the original's.

The Birds II actually follows Daphne Du Maurier's short story pretty close. The family in her awesome recommended book are named the Hocken's, and there isn't much action from the birds, but more of unseen smashing and pecking. Alfred Hitchcock said that in The Birds, he wanted to drop everything in the original story but the main idea of the birds. The book, and the two movies altogether still make you wonder what would happen if the birds were to attack. We wouldn't have a chance. How could fight them? There would be no place to hide.

I really have to say the only real good acting was by the girls who played the two daughter, Megan Gallagher, and Stephanie Milford, and of course Tippi Hedren. The two girls were pretty good since they haven't been in any other movies, and are 9 and 11. I wished they would've focused on the birds a little more instead of the families problems, which added a little too much to the story. It would've been better had the plot line been more like the original, focusing very little on the characters problems, but giving you enough to chew on. If you want to see the birds really get mad, rent this movie. If your ready for a disappointment rent this movie. If you want to see a masterpiece, rent the original. The only reason I put 5 stars was because I liked it very much. You won't like it unless your like me.",1077667200,5,3992,4.331550802139038

  A family with two girls rents a house for the summer at Land's End, 30 miles from Bodega Bay.  They notice a boat out in the water, but what they do not know yet is that the occupant of the boat was grossly pecked and murdered by the birds.  In town, at the Shell Shop, Helen (Tippi Hedren) knows where everyone lives and knows all the secrets.  When Ted (Brad Johnson) gets pecked on the head by a seagull, he becomes concerned and sees a doctor.  The doctor tells him, there have been more seagulls than normal.  The two girls are enjoying exploring the beach for sand dollars.  They come across a dead bird and then just behind them, the body of a dead man.  His eyes have been pecked.  It is the man from the boat.  As in the first film, the birds begin to attack in mass quantities and to this family.
  Not as good as Alfred Hitchcock's film, but only Brad Johnson and Tippi Hedren can peck your interest in this made-for-cable tv movie.  Cast also includes Chelsea Field, James Naughton, Stephanie Milfors and Megan Gallacher.

Update: November 2017: The Birds will become a tv series for the BBC based upon the 1952 book where the story took place in Cornwall, England, not of the Alfred Hitchcock movie in 1963.",1074816000,7,1681,5.482490272373541
7868901,1,6304375379,"Nobody ever knew the mystery of the birds' attack. Back in 1968, renowned director Alfred Hitchcock produced one of the finest films in history..The Birds. The storyline was simple.  Land's End, a small seaside resort is  suddenly attacked by gulls and it seems that they are attracted to a  particular woman, Helen (Tippi Hedren).  Many shocking scenes follow in the  first such as the scene where she is nearly pecked to death by the vicious  animals.  Now the Birds 2 It is nearly 25 years later.  The Birds are back  and more brutal than ever in this 'apparently terrifying' sequel to the  most classic horror films of the 60's.  The same story abides with not any  effect whatsoever on the mind.  The birds once again attack and prey on a  particular family as usual.  Wafer thin plot which drags on and on. I  wouldn't be surprised if I see Birds III in our video stores in the next  year!  Tippi Hedren makes a brief cameo appearance as the tortured victim  Helen.  Yet no mention of her traumatic experience is mentioned.  Strange  don't you think? Silly film which should have all it's copies incinerated  without delay.",957398400,5,1129,4.676923076923077
