5405466,5,B00AAFJ736,"Outstanding !  After studying this subject for over 25 years, I am fascinated with  Kent Hovind's materials on the issue of creation, whether or not it also deals with evolution. I would also recommend to anyone who may be even slightly interested in this subject the review of Kent Hovind's free videos posted on www. YouTube.com !  Just type his last name into the search box and check out 20 debates with evolutionists, atheists and other scientists who attempt to argue in favor of evolution. Wow! I have listened to all 20 debates, most of them are over two hours long. Will probably listen to them again and again. Additionally, there are many free seminars taught by Kent Hovind right on YouTube.com.",1410393600,7,707,4.778688524590164

5405468,4,B00AAFJ736,"A great scientific DVD series telling the OTHER side opposite Evolution. Simple and easy to understand.
PROBLEM: The first DVD in the series would only play for the first 39 minutes, then freeze. The CD of it was included so did not complain. The rest played just fine.",1404604800,4,269,4.625

5405470,5,B00AAFJ736,"There are a great deal of things people never think of, many are found in this set.  If you can watch this and learn nothing, it is because you just love to see it again.",1388275200,3,170,3.857142857142857
5405471,5,B00AAFJ736,"Awesome information!  Always fresh, even if you've watched it 17 times in a row.  Never get tired of it. Loaded with TRUTH.  Loaded with humor & thought-provoking witty comments.  Everyone should have this Series or at least watch it!",1372636800,9,234,4.923076923076923

8549130,1,B00AAFJ736,"This series proves evolution is not true. That ""theory"" claims that everything that there is ""evolved"" from something else. If that were true, and it is not, why are there still CDs around if, as is claimed, Blue Rays ""evolved"" out of CDs?",1493510400,,239,4.5813953488372094

8549132,2,B00AAFJ736,"Most of the DVDs had a problem with the recording.  The picture and audio would be broken up, one disk wouldn't play, one disk labeled as Session 5 turned out to be Session 2 when played.  I felt that these were copies of a worn out original.  I wrote an email to the supplier indicating I would simply like to exchange the set for a set they could verify worked properly.  I have not heard back.  I guess my next step is to ask for a refund and purchase a set from someone else.

The Series is a great series.  I have an older VHS version and this new series had some new information that is worthwhile and would be great for sharing with others.",1447372800,3,647,4.128

8549134,5,B00AAFJ736,I bought the seminar workbook with this series which makes for a perfect study combination.,1438732800,2,91,5.133333333333334
8549135,5,B00AAFJ736,"We were given a set of these on vhs tapes, and really enjoyed them.  So when the tapes got too old to have good audio, we decided it was worth it to buy them on dvd because we liked watching again them from time to time.  Kent Hovind is a young Earth creationist, and he explains why very well---clearly, and with humor.  I had some second thoughts at first, when I discovered he'd been sent to prison for tax evasion, but decided to check them out anyway.  I'm glad we did. These seminars have nothing to do with his current troubles, and stand alone as a great way to understand God's original design of the Earth and how creation came to be.  I highly recommend these dvd's.",1428710400,2,677,4.299212598425197
8549136,5,B00AAFJ736,"Kent Hovind is the most dangerous man to atheism. My opinion of this is simple, Kent Hovind explains why Evolution is a fantasy and completely fabricated to destroy Christian faith and the general idea of creation. If you're soul searching where you came from, this collection of Kent's seminars might save you to Christ. It did for me.

Earlier in my life,  I had God removed from my soul. I had doubts.  And I contribute the theory of evolution to me losing my faith. Later in life, I was desperate to find the truth to why Im here, what should I be doing? A friend of mine a few years ago,  told me about  this man named Dr. Kent Hovind who did creation seminars. I didn't even know what creation was. To me, it sounded like a waste of time. He told me his story.  Dr. Kent Hovind was a science teacher in Florida for 15 years and eventually became a preacher. For 15 years he taught general science, but he started to have an awakening.  But he learned he had a higher calling and wanted to get a message out to the kids. He got fed up with the lies the theory of Evolution used to support aspects of the theory.  The word of Evolution is a complicated word, but in a nutshell, if you go back far enough, it says you all came from a rock.  Do you see how that could be damaging to a faith? But what if you also knew that they used lies to get the point across? Trust me on this one, they have used lies in the text books to support the theory of evolution.

 From the bottom of my heart, and I mean this with every breath I take, Kent Hovind, to me, is a modern day disciple and will show you what I was shown when I watched his word and the truth come into my heart. Kent Hovind wants one thing in this life, he wants people to be saved and wants to show you the LIES that are still in the text books today. And he wants the lies removed from the text books. I recommend getting these discs and sharing them with friends who need saved. Or anyone in your life who is lost in life. God bless everyone.",1424822400,2,2005,4.089285714285714
8549137,4,B00AAFJ736,"It was exactly what was displayed. The actual plastic cases to go with it would have been nice, other than that great value.",1423872000,3,124,4.434782608695652
