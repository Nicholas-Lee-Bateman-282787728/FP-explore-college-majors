8351518,5,B0025ZIV5O,"I love this set. Some of the most famous/infamous moments in Smoky Mountain Wrestling history. I only wish there were more Wrestling Gold releases. This is a gem to have though.

Just so you know, if you're looking for that crazy moment in Smoky Mountain when New Jack and The Gangstas beat the crap out of the Rock 'n Roll Express and then gave a controversial promo, here it is. It's on Before they Were Famous.

Night of the Legends is a great event to. I love the way they recap the entire feud between Cornette and Bob Armstrong going into the Main Event.",1501286400,,560,4.375
