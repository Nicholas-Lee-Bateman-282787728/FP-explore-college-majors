5161486,5,B008H1Q4XQ,"Giorgio Ferroni, the director of ""The Night of the Devils"" (AKA: ""La Notte dei Diavoli""), did not make many horror films, but he was an accomplished director in the Italian film industry for many years prior to 1972 and the release of ""The Night of the Devils.""  Raro Videoo has brought us this blu-ray and DVD edition and although I had at first gotten one with intermittent sound, the second try was worth the effort.  It is based on an original story by Tolstoy made more famous as part of the trilogy Mario Bava directed with Boris Karloff titled, ""Black Sabbath"" that is hard to find the original American release actually using Karloff's voice and not dubbed in Italian now.  The Ferroni reboot has a good script by Eduardo Manzanos Brochero and Romano Migliori and utilizes great special effects by Carlo Rambaldi (""E.T.""), music by Giorgio Gaslini and cinematography by Manuel Berenguer with editing by Gianmaria Messeri.  Because it was 1972 and they were permitted to up the nudity and gore factors (although it does pre-date much of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci's gore-fests (remember 1972 was the same year we saw Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" as ultra-violent), the film holds up well today.  The film stars Gianni Garko and Agostina Belli, a pretty girl who was next seen in Sergio Solima's 1973 ""Revolver"" with Oliver Reed and Fabio Testi. In both films, the actress hardly uses her facial muscles, which is great for some actresses through the years allowing them to have incredibly unlined skin in their forties and fifties but does not say much for their acting.  It is not so terrible here, but in ""Revolver"" she had an even more integral part and this deficiency sorely affected her performance and the film which was very good nonetheless.  ""The Night of the Devils"" has some of the most disturbing images in horror films and the film is hard to shake off once you see it.  The Raro Video blu-ray is excellent with the original English trailer and an interview with Gaslini and an garish introduction by Chris Alexander of ""Fangoria"" magazine, who also wrote the liner notes and conducted the interview with Gaslini reiterated in an accompanying color booklet.  ""The Night of the Devils"" is in color, Italian with subtitles and 93 minutes.",1390003200,,2260,4.849350649350649
5161487,4,B008H1Q4XQ,"The Four stars is for the movie itself, which for Italian Horror fans, is a underrated must!  However, look at the title, it clearly says BLU-RAY, but look below the star rating and you will see ""DVD"".  When I ordered the item because it was on sale, I thought I was getting the Blu Ray as I did NOT see the DVD below the star rating (frankly, I was too excited to be getting the Blu Ray at such a great price I ordered immediately.  But of course, what came was the DVD, NOT the Blu Ray. Buyer Beware and make sure and do a search on Amazon to find the actual Blu Ray (has the blu-ray logo in the upper right and corner of the the cover).",1385596800,,639,3.9765625
5161488,2,B008H1Q4XQ,"Incorrectly labeled as a Blu-ray.  This is listed and sold on Amazon as a blu-ray version for the 3rd party Warp Speed Sales.  It arrived in a standard DVD case, the theft protection seal at the top of the case says it is a DVD, the cover artwork says it as a DVD disc, but the warehouse stock label on the film wrap says it is a blu-ray.  The disc was loose in the dvd case and the underside of the disc was severely scratched in shipment.  It plays, nonetheless, but my player identifies it as a dvd not a blu-ray.  Trying to get a return label from Amazon is problematic apparently also, since trying to go through the returns process I only get the notice to contact Customer Services instead.  Still awaiting feedback.

As for the two star rating, that is for the quality of the Raro Video transfer of the movie itself.  For a DVD it is pretty good video and audio restoration, no noticeable scratches or hair on the gate, good color and film grain and crisp audio.  There is slight jitter of title credits and jagged edges on the subtitles.  Overall, a decent DVD, but still not a Blu-ray version.",1380585600,,1103,4.362745098039215

It's also worth liking them on Facebook. You not only get product updates but they sometimes offer a free bonus DVD with purchase. And no I don't work for the company I just dig what they are doing.

5161492,5,B008H1Q4XQ,"When I had read throughout various Euro Cult Cinema websites that Raro Video USA was releasing Director Giorgio Ferroni's 'THE NIGHT OF THE DEVILS' aka 'LA NOTTE DEI DIAVOLI""-1972 on BluRay , I shivered with anticipation.  Available for over a decade in inferior VHS and DVD bootlegs, the film can now be fully appreciated in its wonderful 2.35 glory with updated English subtitles and gorgeous DTS-HD MA 2.0 audio.  Director Ferroni touched many genres including sword and sandal and a quartet of Spaghetti Westerns with actor Giuliano Gemma but only made two entries in the Horror/Thriller genre, this one and the wonderfully atmospheric 'MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN' aka 'IL MULINO DELLE DONNE DI PIETRA'- 1960 available in a beautiful transfer from the Mondo Macabro label.  The short story by Tolstoy 'THE WURDALAK' was unforgettably lensed as part of a horror trilogy by Horror maestro Mario Bava in 'BLACK SABBATH' aka 'I TRE VOLTI DELLA PAURA'-1963 starring Boris Karloff but now Ferroni reboots the tragic family tale into a modern setting somewhere in the Hungarian countryside. By having our protagonist confined to an insane asylum, we are allowed to experience the nightmare in flashback culminating in an exciting climax at the fade out.  The cast is excellent:  Gianni Garko who is known to Euro fans as the classic Western character Sartana : the stunning Agostina Belli who made many genre titles including Director Edward Dymitryk's infamous version of 'BLUEBEARD'-1972 (wait till you see her beautiful blue eyes in Blu-Ray) and other familiar faces including a wonderful cameo by actress Maria Monti who plays the eerie witch of the town.  Monti also acted in Bava's 'DROP OF WATER' episode in 'BLACK SABBATH' .as the spiritualist's housekeeper.  The true scene stealer is child actress Cinzia De Carolis who plays Irena predating the child vampires from such films as Neil Jordan's 'INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE' -1994 and Director Tomas Alfredson's 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN'-2008 among others.  De Carolis who also played in Director Dario Argento's 'THE CAT OF NINE TAILS' aka 'IL GATTO A NOVE CODE'-1971 as blind Karl Malden's sidekick plays her vampire role with animalistic gusto and is hard to shake after the film fades to black.  I purchased this through a company called Fictions because it seems Raro Video keeps postponing the release through Amazon so scoff it up while you can, it arrives in good condition and it is a US release not an import.  The release has a few extras including an unnecessarily loud introduction to the film by Fangoria magazines Chris Alexander and an interview with composer Giorgio Gaslini who seems annoyed with his interviewer throughout the Q's & A's.  There is a booklet included with the same Q & A interview with Gaslini and liner notes by Alexander.  Highly recommended for Euro Horror and vampire film fans, Raro Video should be commended for bringing this rarity into the digital age showing how Britain's Hammer Films were not the only memorable studios releasing excellent product in the late sixties/early seventies.",1357430400,17,3077,5.083333333333333
5161493,5,B008H1Q4XQ,"Giorgio Ferroni (1908-1981) was an Italian director that helmed almost every kind of genre of films, including war, ancient Rome, Mythology, and more. He also made incursions into the then popular culture of Italian horror movies during the early seventies, a great result being the penetrating and electrifying ""The Night of the Devils.""

Gianni Garko, who we meet at the beginning of the movie after being found in the wild and taken to the hospital, is Nicola, the unlucky fellow who crashes his car in the woods, trying to avoid a lady that crossed his way. He looks for help at the closest town that he is able to find. Only that this town is almost deserted - and there is a good reason for it. The only family left is the one led by Gorca (Bill Vanders), who has told his family that if he doesn't show up at a certain time to the house, to not let him back in, because he will kill them all. Many that have done so in town have had that experience, and met a horrible dead. It is the curse of Vourdalak, that is, incorporeal material creatures, which has taken over the community and created a never-ending chain of death.  Nicola, of course, is incredulous, but he will learn the hard way. In addition, things get complicated when he falls for Sdenka (Agostina Belli), Gorca's beautiful daughter.

The film is dark and the atmosphere is eerie, like a good horror flick should be. It also has some nudity, as it was required during those years in Italian Cinema, and it has survived the test of time as a Euro-Horror classic. The Blu-ray edition features interviews with Chris Alexander (Fangoria Magazine) and composer Giorgio Gaslini, and a great booklet with the story of the film and its director. (Italy / Spain, 1972, color, 93 min plus additional materials). Reviewed on December 3, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for RaroVideo Blu-ray",1355270400,8,1841,4.641104294478527
8527859,5,B008H1Q4XQ,"Warning SPOILERS!!! I love foreign horror films. Unlike some horror fanatics, I appreciate foreign horror films because they show American audiences something they have never seen before: Horror based on that country's history, traditions and legends. When I see something I don't understand, rather that throwing up my hands and screaming ""Uncle!!!"", I do my homework and research what I don't understand. It gives me a deeper appreciation for the film's country of origin. Which brings me to this Italy/Spain co-production.
  We see a man (Gianni Garko; DEVIL FISH - 1984), all bloody and bruised, stumbling through the forest and passing out on the bank of a river. We then flash-forward  to a short time later, where the man is going through some type of therapy at the Salus Clinic, a psychiatric facility (he has all sorts of electrodes attached to his head). We get to see what is in his mind, including a hand fondling a woman's private parts and breasts, x-rays of a human skull and then a woman's head graphically exploding. He then sees two people in white robes inspecting a naked woman in a cell. One of them pulls the woman's still-beating heart out of her chest with his bare hands (all these visions are very gory). Professor Tosi (Umberto Raho; THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW - 1974), the clinic's head psychiatrist, holds a mirror to the man's face and asks him if he recognizes himself or understands English. He just sits there silently. The police commissioner (Tom Felleghy; EYEBALL - 1975) tells Professor Tosi that he will release a photo of the man to the Press in hope they can identify him, but judging by the clothes he wore when he was found, he must be quite wealthy. Professor Tosi tells the commissioner that he believes the man has total amnesia, somehow caused by darkness. When they turn off the lights in his hospital room, he becomes agitated and stares out the window like he is waiting for someone or something to arrive. One night, while he is staring out the window, the man sees a car pull up to the clinic gates. A young woman gets out of the car and her face makes the man terribly nervous. The woman tells Professor Tosi that she met the man a week ago, telling Tosi that the man told her he was buying lumber for his company. She tells the doctor that  the man's name is Nicola, but she doesn't know his last name (""I can only tell you he's an honest man.""). She asks the doctor if she can see Nicola and when he sees her, he screams, ""No! No! No! Let me out!"". The staff has to restrain and drug Nicola and the woman disappears, nowhere to be found. The Professor finds her purse, but it lacks any personal items that a woman would carry in it. While Nicola is drugged, he has a long flashback that explains what happened to him a week earlier.
  Nicola is driving down a road and almost hits a witch (Maria Monti; WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? - 1972), who is dressed in black, forcing him off the road and disabling his car. The witch is nowhere to be found, so Nicola walks through the forest to try to find someone to help him. Nicola doesn't see a family digging a grave (but they see him) in an ancient cemetery and burying someone wrapped in a bloody sheet. An old man named Gorca Ciuvelak (William Vanders; THE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS - 1978) throws an ugly idol on the grave and they head back to their village (Gorca's son, Jovan [Mark Roberts; THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE - 1971] asks his father what they should do about the stranger and he says, ""Take care of him.""). When Nicola makes it to the village, he discovers no one will talk to him except for Gorca, who tells him the village is in mourning because he just buried his brother. Since it is going to be dark in about and hour, Gorca invites Nicola to stay at his house with his family. At dinner, Jovan tells Nicola that he will fix his car, saying, ""Tomorrow. Tomorrow when the sun is shining."" That night, Nicola hears a strange howling and then someone knocking on the door. He asks Jovan if he is going to answer the door and he says, ""No. Nobody comes at night."" It is plain to see that the family is scared of something, since there are bars on the windows and all the doors are securely bolted. What could cause a family (hell, the entire village) to be afraid of the night?
  We then see the witch go to the freshly dug grave, slice her hand open on a piece of broken glass and lets her blood drip on the fresh flowers put on the grave. What is she up to? Jovan then tries to sleep with his dead Uncle's young wife Sdenka (Agostina Belli; SCREAM OF THE DEMON LOVER - 1970), who looks exactly like the woman who visited Nicola in the loony bin. She tells Jovan, ""No, he just died this morning!"" The next day, Jovan and Nicola  use some oxen to pull his car to the village. Gorca tells Jovan that he must leave the village and Jovan replies that if he is not back by 6:00 PM, ""You're finished. You'll never be able to return!"" Gorca then leaves the village, but where is he going? Gorca's other son, Vlado (Luis Surez; THE FEAST OF SATAN - 1971), and his wife, Elena (Teresa Gimpera; CRYPT OF THE LIVING DEAD - 1973), call Nicola to come to their house, where Vlado shows him deep scratch marks on the side of his house, which look like they were made by a human hand. Vlado tells Nicola not to worry because, ""By tomorrow, the danger will have disappeared...and gone underground."" What does he mean by that? Vlado then tells Nicola that his Uncle didn't die yesterday, but a month ago and Jovan killed him. Could Nicola be next?
  We then see Gorca carrying a sharpened stick, as he goes looking for the witch. We also discover that the witch is pregnant and has an aversion to sunlight. She waits for Gorca to arrive, holding the ugly idol and an ox horn in her hands.  Gorca enters her barn and picks up the idol. The witch cackles and we see the idol fall to the ground, Gorca's fate unknown. Gorca's very young granddaughter, Mira (Sabrina Tamborra) tells Nicola about the witch and how her grandfather went to kill her (When Nicola asks her why the witch doesn't come to get them during the daytime, she says, ""Witches are like evil spirits. All bad things go around after dark."" Ah, the wisdom of children!). She tells Nicola that the only way to kill a witch is to pierce her in the heart with a sharpened stick. But it will not be easy. If Grandpa fails to kill her, he will become one of ""them"". As it is approaching 6:00 PM, Nicola sees Jovan sharpening a stick. He plans on killing Gorca if he doesn't come home on time. Nicola tells Jovan that if he kills his father he will go to the authorities. Jovan tells him to mind his own business. Exactly at 6:00 PM, Gorca arrives at the house, shows everyone a severed hand and announces, ""The curse has been broken."" But has it?
  This is an atmospheric take on the vampire legend, inspired by Tolstoy's ""The Wurdulak"", which was also a segment of Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (1963), starring Boris Karloff. Capably directed by Giorgio Ferroni (THE MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN - 1960; THE TROJAN HORSE - 1961; SECRET AGENT SUPER DRAGON - 1966), who has been directing films since the early 1930's (he passed away in 1981), many of those films documentaries about Italy's past. I think that is why this film is so affecting, as Ferroni has an eye for even the smallest of details, transporting us back to a time when people believed in witches and other evils of the night. While very little blood drinking is on view (the only instance of it comes later in the film when Mira bites Elena on her neck and then exposes her breast!), Ferroni makes sure that the red stuff flows freely, as we see beating human hearts, exploding heads and other bloody visuals (special effects supplied by Carlo Rambaldi; A BAY OF BLOOD - 1971; DEEP RED - 1975), including Vlado skinning a rabbit. The film's highlight is when Jovan discovers Gorca is one of them. He shoves a sharpened stick into Gorca's chest and twists it (nothing is left to the imagination) and then we watch as Gorca decomposes (masterfully done). It is this scene and what happens after it, that put Nicola in the mental hospital. His mind can't accept what is happening around him. I am sure that people raised during the Technological Age would react the same way. We refuse to accept what we can't understand. When Nicola finally accepts what is happening around him and tries to save new love Sdenka, he makes a terrible discovery that his mind just cannot accept. And that what makes this film so enjoyable. The old ways always wins, no matter how advanced society has become. But then the film throws us a monkey wrench: Is Nicola actually crazy and was this whole story just a figment of his twisted imagination? The twisty screenplay, by Eduardo Manzanos THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH - 1971), Romano Migliorini (THE BLOODY PIT OF HORROR - 1965) & Gianbattista Mussetto (LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH - 1978), wisely avoids using the word ""vampire"", making the creatures we view much more supernatural and deadly.
  Never available theatrically or on VHS in the United States. The DVD and Blu-ray from Raro Video is in its original OAR and it looks tremendous.  It is available dubbed in English or in its original Italian with optional English subtitles. When available, I always go for the original language because dubbing can take away some of the finer nuances of the performances (The title of the print on these discs is LA NOTTE DEI DIAVOLI, which translates to the review title). Raro always does a great job with their presentations and this is no exception. It comes with a twelve page booklet, giving us important information on the director and the making of this film, as well as a new interview with composer Giorgio Gaslini (CROSS CURRENT - 1971; THE SLASHER...IS THE SEX MANIAC! - 1972), who supplied this film's haunting music score. Gaslini plays the music theme by memory and tells us it was the only time he composed music while actually seeing seeing the film shot. Usually music composers are given a final cut and compose the music after the fact. He tells us this was the only time he has done that in the over forty films he has scored and he wishes he was able to do it more. He considers it his best music score. I agree. This is a superb film made at the height of Italian horror. Also starring Cinzia De Carolis, Rosita Torosh, Stefano Oppedisano and John Bartha. Not Rated (full of full-frontal female nudity and scenes of extreme bloody gore).",1525392000,,10516,4.500261917234154

8527861,5,B008H1Q4XQ,"Oh God, where to begin? First off, bare essentials. Raro Video's DVD release of Giorgio Ferroni's flat-out classic NIGHT OF THE DEVILS (La Notte dei Diavoli) from 1972 is quite superb. In addition to offering the film in a new HD transfer with improved English subtitles, this package includes an excellent bonus feature in the form of a video interview with Fangoria Magazine's Chris Alexander who does a top-notch job at putting this awesome film within the context of Italian/Spanish horror film history and very colorfully discusses the film's history, technical aspects and aesthetic features. This interview with Chris Alexander serves as a perfect introduction to the film (though it contains a few spoilers so you may want to wait until after viewing the film to watch this great bonus feature). There is also an interview with legendary composer Giorgio Gaslini (DEEP RED) on his awesome score for NIGHT OF THE DEVILS, etc. The English trailer as well as a very rad 12 page booklet on the film's history, critical reception, another excellent interview with composer Giorgio Gaslini, the film's poster art, film stills,  etc. is also included. So for all intensive purposes Raro Video get a huge thumbs up for their excellent presentation of this masterpiece.

NIGHT OF THE DEVILS is based upon the Leo Tolstoy story ""The Wurdulak"" concerning a cursed, backwoods family who have degenerated into fear and madness. The film is told via a series of wildly gory (the legendary Carlo Rimbaldi did the film's killer fx) and perverse but erotic flashbacks which are endured by the film's protagonist: a nameless, bleeding man who was found on the edge of the woods and due to his catatonic state is now a patient in a mental hospital. It turns out that this man was a business man from England who had travelled to the dark woods of Italy on business as representative of a lumber operation. Upon entering the woods he nearly strikes a woman in black, resulting in his car crashing into a tree. He quickly makes contact with a very strange family who bolt and shutter the doors and windows at precisely 6PM every night and seem to be harboring some dreadful secrets. Despite getting his car repaired with help from one of the members of the family he quickly realizes that he is trapped in the woods with the family as things get rapidly out of control.

Without spoiling the fun, let's just say that the family are the last remnants of a once thriving community (all of whom have left) but live under a horrible curse which results in the living dead. Not zombies, but rather animated corpses who are controlled by the powers of witchcraft. When killed these ""living dead"" creatures melt (ala EVIL DEAD, a film which, among many other, must have been influenced by NIGHT OF THE DEVILS). Things get complicated when having fallen in love with one of family's beautiful women, our protagonist attempts to extricate her from the house in the woods only to result in an unforgettable climax which takes place within the confines of the mental institution.

Some of you may be thinking, ""damn, this sounds familiar."" If so, you're correct as Tolstoy's classic tale was also used as the basis of the classic Mario Bava film BLACK SABBATH. However, by 1972 the film industry had ""evolved"" in regards to violence, gore, nudity, etc. since the making of Bava's film, allowing director Giorgio Ferroni to go full-throttle with NIGHT OF THE DEVILS. However, rather than just making some shitty exploitation version of Tolstoy's tale, Ferroni (like Bava) was intent on retaining the atmospheric details necessary to make a truly creepy film. In many senses the extremely atmospheric style of NIGHT OF THE DEVILS has much in common with 60's Italian horror films and of course Hammer films. However, with the very tasteful and stylized use of brief flashbacks, quite extreme images of brutal violence (this isn't H.G. Lewis gore, but rather realistic gore one would expect in the classic 70's Italian films of Argento and Fulci) and explicit nudity are brilliantly utilized and Ferroni's NIGHT OF THE DEVILS ended up helping to signal the birth of 70's Italian horror, foreshadowing the brilliance of Argento, Fulci, etc. So in a sense NIGHT OF THE DEVILS is a perfect historical bridge between early and modern horror filmmaking in Italy.

There really is so little negative to say about NIGHT OF THE DEVILS. It is quite simply a masterpiece and a must see film for all fans of well-made 1970's horror with strong acting, great plot, a strong gothic touch and heavy occult overtones mixed with wildly gory flashbacks and a sense of extreme paranoia. It's just a damn fine film...NIGHT OF THE DEVILS is the perfect film to just shut off the lights, take a few tokes, and watch. It's hallucinatory style coupled with the awesome score by composer Giorgio Gaslini make the film a true pleasure and will likely leave you wondering how this film is not considered a full-blown classic by all 70's horror fans. Thankfully, its status as a lost classic can now be remedied due to this very affordable and high quality Raro Video DVD release! For 1972 Italian horror cinema it really does not get any better than NIGHT OF THE DEVILS! A full-blown masterpiece of gory, gothic horror based off one of the most well-written horror tales ever created...One of those rare horror films you'll find yourself returning to for repeated viewings, a testament to Giorgio Ferroni's skill as a director. Gaslini's talent as a composer, and Rimbaldi's skilled special effects. Euro-horror at its best....",1513209600,,5574,4.906680805938494

8527865,5,B008H1Q4XQ,"This is great to watch late at night. The story involves a man in an institution who is seemingly insane at first, but the doctors diagnose him as being a man who could be perfectly normal. He begins having hallucinations that showcase full nudity and gore; this happens during the first 5 minutes. However, despite his visions and behavior, they can't seem to find anything mentally defective about him when they conduct studies. So when the movie shows what happened before he arrived in the mental institution, the question is whether or not he's really insane. The ending of the film also doesn't help to answer that. Despite the full nudity and gore that occurs within the first 5 minutes, the exploitation elements in this are spaced out. With his car breaking down in the countryside, he travels through the forest and takes refuge with a family living isolated in a cabin. At night, everyone must remain inside with the doors and windows boarded and locked; nobody is permitted outside at night. Later, when one makes a decision to find and slay the witch, he's not permitted back inside the cabin if he doesn't accomplish it by a certain time. The entire thing is a great late night classic with the film basically taking place at that cabin and the surrounding forest. Directing is excellent, the acting is good, and the atmosphere and scenery are really good also. Aside from the beginning exploitation scenes, there's other nude scenes and gore in the picture. However, these parts are in different spots throughout. I would classify it as a spooky and suspenseful late night horror classic with scattered elements of exploitation. I bought the DVD elsewhere awhile ago, and it holds up to repeated viewings like a true classic.

The DVD I got has a slipcover and small booklet. The quality is really good, but not quite as good as a couple of my other Raro blu-rays. In my opinion, films like these late night horror classics certainly play much better in the best quality possible on a big screen, instead of watching it on your computer on YOUTUBE. It also has an interview with the composer and an introduction as extras. The main menu screen also has animation.",1455321600,,2178,4.777188328912467
