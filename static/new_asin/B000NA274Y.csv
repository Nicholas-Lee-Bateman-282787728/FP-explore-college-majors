8175999,3,B000NA274Y,This is all very good choreography very much based in ballet and not digressing far from classical dance. John Cage's music however sounds like me snoring. Since the two artists collaborate by chance and the dancers never hear the music until they perform the piece I suggest you turn the sound off and take a chance on playing some music you like while watching the dancers. I tried it out with some music by Scriabin orchestrated by Nemtin called Nuances now unavailable unfortunately and it worked pretty well.,1204934400,4,513,4.840909090909091
