4673263,1,B005F96UL4,"Horrible movie, I wish I could give it a zero. The whole first part of the movie is about kids finding a dead man in a snow drift in front of their house. They proceed to talk about this dead man and death and tell stories of kids dying in a flood. We had to turn it off before we got to anything that was shown in the previews. My kids came down with nightmares. I wish I could get my money back.",1420070400,,397,3.7951807228915664

Family, insecurity, love, fear, death, depression are a few of the topics dealt with in this wonderful little film but no worries, it's how deft and tactful these and many other issues are confronted by the young stars that makes this such a sweet, joyous, touching, hilarious, unique and unforgettable story.",1404086400,,399,5.0606060606060606

4673273,3,B005F96UL4,"Someone recommended this movie to me, and I thought it was only about building snowmen. I found it difficult to explain a lot of the backstory to my 3 year old (walking sadly in a graveyard, dying, cancer). I think this is a great movie for older kids 8+ or for children who already grasp these situations. We will try again when he's older, because it is very well written and acted.",1395014400,2,384,4.347222222222222

This great film has no graphic violence (only some minor kid stuff) and language suitable for any age.  We thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  We sometimes have kids from our church come over for a ""Movie Night"" and we pop corn, have pizza and watch a good film.

4673311,5,B005F96UL4,"A story about friendship and family and mistakes and forgiveness and the love that flows through it all. You'll enjoy funny scenes like Ray Liotta saying ""h e double hockey sticks"" and scenes of bravery like Billy telling the school he is dying of cancer.

4673313,5,B005F96UL4,"This movie is heartwarming and depicts the reality of loyalty, love, friendship and bullying as it truly happens in the lives of gradeschool children.

4673314,5,B005F96UL4,"I very much enjoyed this lightly-funny movie.  Often, coming-of-age movies of this type go overboard with the change of heart, or have inappropriate scenes.  This film had neither of these; it was carefully crafted so everything in the film was entirely credible, including the main character's change of heart.  I also appreciated how well primed the various plot elements were.  When the film arrived at crucial turning points, the action felt proper for the film.

I would (and will) recommend this film to anyone who asks.

Keep them coming, Arc Entertainment.",1329436800,5,564,5.142857142857143
4673315,3,B005F96UL4,"Snowmen
So I recieved this DVD free to review and have to say other then one 5 min section this was a great film for all ages..

(From Dove.org)
Synopsis:
Limited Theatrical Release - SNOWMEN is a humorous and heartfelt coming-of-age story about three unlikely heroes and the winter that changed their lives forever. After a surprising discovery in the snow catapults three small-town boys into the spotlight, the best friends hatch a plan to be remembered forever by setting a Guinness World Records title. Along the way, the trio battles schoolyard bullies, unites their community and discovers that - while fame may be fleeting - true friendship lasts forever. The film stars Bobby Coleman (Last Song), Ray Liotta (Wild Hogs), Bobbie J. Thompson (Role Models), Josh Flitter (Ace Ventura Jr.) and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future).

Dove Worldview:
One young boy wants to leave behind a legacy, something for everyone to remember him by. Eventually he learns that ""it's not what we do that's important, so much as how we do it."" That is the gift that this truth gives. This film has heart and is very compelling to watch. Children have an amazing way in looking at things differently from adults and these three boys see the world in a much simpler way. As the three young boys work together for one common cause, they also find out what motivates a school yard bully. They reach out to him to help, and for his help too. Along the way they learn a few lessons about life, friendship and how to treat others. This is a charming story for the family and even has a few subtle faith moments. Although there are a few scenes that may be frightening for younger children, we are pleased to award this movie our Dove ""Family Approved"" Seal for ages 12 and over.

The 5 min issue is that there is a scary scene where the boys are playing in a snow drift, almost burried by the plow and then a frozen body is uncovered.  My children were watching this with me and my youngest daughter was scared that night when going to bed.
Other then tha moment it was great for the ENTIRE family and I would recommend it.

For Christian Element I will say that there are a couple chances for this film to take a VERY Christian aproach and it unfortunatly does not.  Just talkes about being good etc...

So Recommended for ages 10 and older or all ages after the scary scene.",1325635200,4,2361,4.554245283018868
4673316,5,B005F96UL4,Adorable family movie - just in time for Christmas!  Well-made with a great message - we'll be buying lots for gifts as well.,1322524800,4,125,4.434782608695652
4673317,5,B005F96UL4,Definitely skews towards a younger audience but feels a lot more like the kids movies of the 80s and 90s. Has a lot more heart and less gimmicks!,1321574400,,145,4.214285714285714
4673318,5,B005F96UL4,"We ended up being pleasantly surprised with the quality of Snowmen. My husband said he thought it was much better than its contemporaries. Family films are often stereotypically cheesy both in the script and the acting but this was not. The main character Billy is played by Bobby Coleman a young up and comer. He did a great job and he was supported well by a few seasoned veterans including Ray Liotta. The two of them made a very touching father-son in this powerful story.

I will add that Nate (6yr) is an especially curious boy and this movie inspired a lot of probing questions both during and after the movie. I think I would use your judgement when watching the movie with kids any younger than 6yr old because of the seriousness of some of the themes: bullies, cancer, what happens when we die, etc. I am certain we will be having conversations on these topics for days to come.

All in all we found Snowmen to be a delightful and profound movie that will appeal to a wide range of ages making it ideal for family viewing. You can learn more about Snowmen by visiting [...]",1320710400,30,1083,4.4646464646464645
4673319,5,B005F96UL4,I love this movie! I was really surprised by how a children's movie could have so much depth while still connecting with its young audience.  My younger siblings loved it!
