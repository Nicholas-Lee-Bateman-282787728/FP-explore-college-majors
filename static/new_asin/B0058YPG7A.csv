4602073,4,B0058YPG7A,"At first I wasn't so sure about this show. The main character is the reason I continued to watch. She has a quick wit and keeps the show moving at an enjoyable pace. The first few episodes are not all that great and were mostly saved by Chloe's spunky nature, but after about the third episode I was hooked. I am now in love with this show and I am dying to see what happens in future season. A great love triangle develops between Chloe, Brian, and Alek that kept me coming back for more. Add in the bad guy/problem of the week that reminded me of some of my favorite shows such as Charmed and Buffy in their early years I found myself loving this show and sad when the summer season came to an end. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys watching shows that remind them of shows they watched when they were teens/tween's. I think this is a great show that deserves the chance to continue to grow and develop.",1313712000,21,927,4.242937853107344
4602090,5,B0058YPG7A,"I, along with thousands of others, are begging anyone who will listen to help us save the Nine Lives of Chloe King.
There is a massive fan base currently trying to save this amazing TV show. It was only on for 2 months and had a total of 10 episodes. 10 episodes is not even close to enough time to properly judge the success of ANY show. It was nominated for 2 teen choice awards and voted best written script.
Chloe King is a new exciting idea with no questionable morals. It's not about a teenager getting pregnant or high school drama. It's a new exciting idea about ancient Egyptian races and it has all the aspects of a great show. Romance, actions, kickass fighting scenes, awesome special effects, and great relationships between characters as well as the cast. Chloe King needs to be saved. She has 9 Lives yet ABCFamily couldn't give her 1 full life. I have never heard of a huge fan base like all of us come from a 10 episode TV show. It doesn't matter if I'm Team Alek or Team Brian or hell even Team Paul- I'm Team Chloe King and thats all that matters.

I'm pleading with anyone who will listen to at least hear the fans out. This is an amazing show with no questionable morals, and an amazing storyline. This show has brought hundreds of thousands of people around the globe to a united front.
We, as the fans, ask you to tell us what you need us to do to help save this show. There is already a petition currently at 104,269 signatures and our goal was 100,000. [...] . There are also a lot of facebook pages devoted to this cause as well as twitter, skyrock, and many more. There are also tshirts being made, and fan art to save this show.
I'm writing this in the hopes that someone will listen and respond. The media is key to our success, and if you believe in anything that is not related to reality television, then please help us. You have the power to make this happen, and we will not stop until you do.",1324339200,60,1927,4.279452054794521

4602092,5,B0058YPG7A,"I probably would not be the normal fan for a show like this, 50'ish male, but I found the plotting and characterization fascinating and extremely well done.  The inter-personal dynamics between the characters kept me interested.
  Chloe's care/love for Brian and the fact that she could not love him in return, at least with physical expressions (kissing) because it would kill him left a very thick tension in the air vis-a-vis Alec's jealousy.
  I can highly recommend watching this on the ABC site which shows past shows.  It is a crying shame they cancelled this show as it was wonderful in terms of plot, characters, tension and the intangibles of how all they actors played it together.
  Plus, with the deaths of several characters, that would give them a chance to introduce a bunch of new characters and give the remaining mai characters a chance to work on how they are going to eliminate the people who killed their friends.",1320537600,9,935,4.8
4602093,2,B0058YPG7A,"This is a low budget TV production. I only watched 4 episodes so maybe I am not being fair. GIMMIC photographic shots with blurring to ""simulate actions and fights"" is bad. The story is weak because it lacks even remote believability in the WHY areas. Why does a kiss cause death on the lips yet when she gets and give kisses on the cheek to and from others there is no problem?  Apparently it must be on the lips to kill. WHY do the bad guy talk instead of killing her and ending it? (this I admit is common with many videos). WHY did they wait for her birthday to kill her? WHY does she only have short lived black and blue marks after falling 20 stories? Ok, she can live but her body must be made of rubber.  She should be toothpaste falling that far.  WHY does she get 3 boyfriends all in one day on the day before she turns 16, yet never had any before then?  WHY does the bad guy on her roof hang around instead of climbing in he window or even opening the door and try to kill her? WHY are the ""saviors"" not on the roof when the bad guy is there? WHY is her mother so forgiving/understanding and WHY does her Dad not answer her eMails and try to save her? WHY do the ""BAD"" guy hate her and want to kill her, I can believe the need(?)for 9 times that is the nave of the video?... Sorry even her 3 supporting friends seem to be very lucky and never get killed? WHY...Because this series was so bad it only had a pilot and 9 lives like our hero before being cut.. SORRY, tell me why I am wrong!",1318723200,,1499,4.037037037037037

4602095,5,B0058YPG7A,"I watched the first three episodes and lost interest in the show.  However, recently, I decided to give the series another chance and watched all 10 episodes on ABC Family's website. My opinion definitely changed about the series, and I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the character development. In fact, I liked the show so much that I purchased the series in HD on itunes.  Wish there were more.....",1317945600,2,401,4.797101449275362

4602097,5,B0058YPG7A,"When this season becomes available to buy, I highly recommend getting it. It's a nice show for the whole family. unlike all of the other shows on ABC Family that include premarital sex and constant cursing, this show is clean of all of that. It truly is safe for the entire family! The only thing that upsets me about the show is the uncalled for cancellation. However, I, along with several other fans, will not cease to try and get the show back on the air.",1316131200,5,459,4.348837209302325

4602099,5,B0058YPG7A,"9 reasons to love The Nine Lives Of Chloe King.

1.  Great chemistry between Amy Peitz and Skyler Samuels as mother and daughter (Meredith and Chloe), best scenes in the show.

2.  Great action, the actors abilities to do some of their own stunts has gotten better with each episode, and they are now able to really do some great fight scenes, with great editing.

3.  Great writing, the writing got better and better.  Green Star, Heartbreaker, and Beautiful Day (finale) is some of the best writing I have seen on television in a long time.

4.  Great chemistry between the friends, Amy, Paul, and Chloe, Grace Phipps, Ki Hong Lee and Skyler Samuels seem as if they have been friends for life.  It is also a great teacher of lessons on friendship.

5.  Do the right thing, because its the right thing to do, is a huge lesson that this show teaches young people every episode.

6.  Great villains, the Order has so much more potential as a great villain group on TV.

7.  The humor mixed in with great heart makes this show a step above all others.

8.  The entire family can watch together, this show appeals to everyone.

9.  Skyler Samuels, the Buffy and Max of the 21st century, but a much better actress than her two predecessors.

This series deserves more episodes to come.  After the finale, who knows what could happen...and IMO, that is great television.

5 stars, two thumbs up.",1314748800,25,1390,4.538461538461538

8462327,5,B0058YPG7A,"I loved watching the Nine Lives of Chloe King!!!  It was my favorite show and now it is gone and I am sad!!!!!!!!  I want The Nine Lives of Chloe King back!!!  I think that if ABC Family won't bring The Nine Lives of Chloe King back for a lot more seasons, then at least come out with a movie OR have it on at the same time it usually came on every week for those Chloe King fans who miss it and want to watch it all over again! Netflix use to have it on there, but then they removed it and won't put it back on at all and that just makes me mad!!!!!  I WANT THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1387238400,2,616,3.904

8462329,3,B0058YPG7A,"I like the idea of this show and it inevitably draws Buffy comparisons which is why I decided to watch it on Netflix one boring sick day.
Summary: On her 16th birthday, an awkward teenager comes into her powers as a non human supernatural being called a Mai: an Egyptian being with cat eyes, cat claws, and cat agility. These beings are hunted by an Order of humans. UNLIKE Buffy, Chloe is awkward, immature, and socially clumsy. When talking to guys, she is awkward in a painful way- a rambling, giggling, hair-twirling way. She goes out to over 21 clubs and parties carelessly while trying so hard to act like an adult. The only time she isn't awkward is when she is training and fighting. She also suddenly gets 2 love interests, and one of them is a naive college boy with no friends and a rich daddy who works with the Order, who REALLY shouldn't be hanging out with a high school girl in the first place. However he is obsessed with her and it's more than a little creepy. Chloe is always running around after dark in the city with no car, and stays out partying until 1. By far the most unrealistic situation. The love triangle is as annoying as rich college boy following Chloe like a puppy. The third guy she is completely oblivious to and of course the perfect match the series is setting her up for...possibly. Because they want you to wonder. Other than Chloe's painful awkwardness and lame jokes, and personality-free college boy Brian, she has to stick her nose in every situation she comes across and it always ends up with people in danger. But these tense action sequences are the best part of the show. Fast forward through the pointless wandering conversations with Brian and save yourself a headache. It's aimed at teenagers...but also too far off the mark to be realistic to them- unless of course they are going out clubbing like she does and fighting seedy characters in warehouses and alleys.",1348358400,,1916,4.605263157894737
8462330,5,B0058YPG7A,"I really enjoyed watching this show.  Unfortunately, by the time I discovered it, ABC had already taken it off the air, so I settled with watching it on Netflix.  I am delighted that the episodes can be downloaded on iTunes, but why aren't the DVDs/BluRays avaialble yet?  As far as the show goes, it's a light-hearted mix of fun and fancy.  Not terribly serious, but the plot is interesting and the characters are enjoyable.  It's nice to have a show that's not quite so angst-ridden and have a lead character who is upbeat, optimistic and values the people around her, regardless of surrounding prejudices.  I sincerely hope that ABC will release the show on disc since Netflix and iTunes aren't going to offer the episodes forever.  I'm curious as to why the show was axed with a cliff-hanger as the final episode?  If a second season was originally planned and the network pulled the funding, at least a final episode with some degree of resolution is in order.  If they decided to cancel the show earlier on, then the final episode reflects some pretty poor planning on the network's part.",1343606400,,1094,4.71578947368421
8462331,5,B0058YPG7A,"Yep another great series that just gets off the ground before it gets shutdown.

Chloe King (Skyler Samuels) and parts of her body are changing. She must decide how to handle the changes and what they mean. Who can she tell and who can she not? That is not all a cabal called The Order is out to get her. This is fun to watch and they to the time to have stories at many levels of complexity overlap.  There are also the standards how people deal with people stories.  The most interesting quality for Chloe is her kisses are to die for.

Yes I know those Jackals at ABC declawed Chloe.",1340582400,,586,4.205357142857143
