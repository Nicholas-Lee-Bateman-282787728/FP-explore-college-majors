8340097,1,B001ST9XVO,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$ , I BOUGHT THIS ON FEEBAY IF YOU NEED PROOF AND I UNDERSTAND THINGS CAN BE BIASED BUT THIS CRAP IS BASICALLY JUST MADE UP THEORIES WITH NO FACTUAL BASIS AND SHAME ON ANYONE WHO GAVE THIS FAIRY TALE 5 STARS BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW EVEN A TAD ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE GAC OR CLS  YOU COULDNT EVEN SIT THROUGH THIS TRASH AND THAT HERMAN VIOLA SHOULD BE ASHAMED ABOUT SPREADING LIES ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY AND WHAT TYPE OF MAN THE GENERAL WAS TO SPEW HIS PEACEFUL NATIVE AMERICAN FARMER LIES REVISIONIST HISTORY AGENDA . MY FAVORITE QUOTE IS IF CUSTER WOULDVE CAME TO RENO'S AID AND NOT ABANDONED HIM THE 7TH WOULDVE WON THE DAY ? SO CUSTER THE ONLY ONE WHO CAME TO FIGHT THAT DAY WASNT ABANDONED BY THE DRUNKEN COWARD RENO AND THE MALCONTENT BENTEEN WHO DISOBEYED BASIC ORDERS .GARRYOWEN",1502409600,2,802,4.346666666666667

8340101,4,B001ST9XVO,I liked the Little Big Horn / The Untold Story/ The facts behind the story were fairly accurate. Although the narrative and acting could have been better done. But i wasn't looking for academy winning performances. for most part I thought it was a good production.,1425859200,6,264,4.760869565217392
8340102,5,B001ST9XVO,"I have been reading books on Custer. Also viewing all the DVDs (Hollywood and documentary) I could find and this is a very good DVD on the subject. I don't think you can just pick up one book, one DVD and say you know about the Custer controversy. There is lots to ponder and never will be solved but this is more factual than many IMO. I won't go into the history and every fact valid or not. Just to say you can't go wrong with this nearly 2 hr documentary on Custer and the fatal day.",1424563200,6,487,4.030927835051546

8340105,5,B001ST9XVO,This is a real good DVD. Shows the Indian side of the story. From a perspective rarely seen. Talked about how the Massecre at the Little Big Horn came about. A step-by-step listing of events that took place. Very informative.,1294790400,32,225,4.65
