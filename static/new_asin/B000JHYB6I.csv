8150386,5,B000JHYB6I,"Ever since I was a child this has been one of my favorite Easter shows. No silly rabbits or anything, just the true meaning. An excellent vintage stop motion animated show with a great message, you can't beat it!",1382140800,2,212,4.461538461538462
8150387,5,B000JHYB6I,"Two of the most memorable episodes of ""Davey and Goliath"" was the Christmas special and, of coarse, the one I am now reviewing; ""Happy Easter"". As a child this thought-provoking and tender episode brought tears to my eyes. Now, watching it once more as an adult, I find myself still fighting to hold back that tear. Although it's nothing more than stop-motion animation compiled with voice actors, Davey's reaction to the death of his beloved grandmother is all too painfully real. It's only until the end of the episode that Davey (*and all of us watching*) finally discover a sense of relief from his great loss through Davey's father's re-telling of the story of the death, resurrection and salvation of Jesus Christ. While most Easter specials deal with nothing more than rabbits and eggs, this heart-tugging Davey and Goliath episode dares to show what Easter really is all about. The only thing that I can not understand is why this classic has not found it's way to dvd yet. However, if it takes dusting off the old vhs player in order to watch this, then I recommend it most highly. God Bless.",1322956800,2,1101,4.739583333333333
8150388,5,B000JHYB6I,"I just purchased this VHS tape for my family.  Davey and Goliath (D & G) films represent some of the earliest mass marketed stop motion animation.  I grew up viewing every episode as shown when syndicated for public television.

The background of D & G started in 1959 when the United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA), now the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), contracted with Art and Ruth Clokey of ""Gumby"" creation fame to produce a new children's show with a realistic emphasis on morals and values under the rubric of Lutheran dogma.

D & G's special episode ""Happy Easter, The Story of a Boy and His Dog ... and The True Meaning of Easter"" is one of the best.

In this episode Davey has to contend with the death of his grandmother right before Easter.  Davey is rightfully heartbroken and grieving.  He refuses to play at any of his little league baseball games.  Then his father explains that he will see his grandmother in Heaven as Jesus Christ promised that we would.

A very valuable tool in introducing children not only to the concept of Easter, but of death in general.  Although D & G has been hilariously lampooned in no less than four of ""The Simpsons"" episodes, for me it will always be an emotional tear-jerker.

Well done.",1206144000,,1256,4.638009049773756
