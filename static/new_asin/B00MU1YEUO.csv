8674590,5,B00MU1YEUO,"My grandkids & I love the Iesodo series of movies.  Each video teaches about one of the Fruits of the Spirit or the Character God works to build within a person after they come to Christ as their Savior.

Iesodo portrays Jesus.  Each of the bird characters is a character from the Bible.  Maggie is Mary Magdalene, for instance.  Other characters get introduced over the course of the entire series...Matt is the apostle Matthew, Tom is the apostle Thomas, etc

Their are catchy tunes and easily-memorized lyrics to the songs that weave through the events of the stories.  My grandkids will burst out singing those songs as they are playing, riding in the car, walking around the block; they songs stick with them & may likely be what makes more sense to them later on in years at a time when they truly need to lean on the lesson they teach.",1480377600,,842,4.5364238410596025
