8199265,4,B000R7HZZ4,"This three episodes specials chronicles the Baldwins, Battersby and Duckworth families on ""Coronation Street."" Each family had a distinct and unique personality on the street.

The Baldwins are led by Mike (Johnny Briggs MBE) who left series after 30 years. He owned a sewing factory and he was the street's Casanova with the ladies. Mike, Ken Barlow and Deidre had a convoluted love triangle. He had left behind a growing family on the street. His last appearance was a heartbreaking for viewers. I didn't know that Alma Baldwin died of cancer until I saw the DVD. Amanda Barrie was terrific in the role.

The second family are the Battersby who can be described as eccentric, loud and even annoying. They are definitely lower class but entertaining nonetheless.

The final family are the Duckworths led by Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera (Elizabeth Dawn MBE). Jack and Vera have been through a lot in their marriage but you couldn't ask for more entertaining couple.",1495065600,,964,4.938271604938271

8199267,4,B000R7HZZ4,"This is a bit dated now, as the only members of these families left on the street are Leanne, Fiz, Tyrone and Chesny. But if you're a real Corrie fan, you'll love seeing the old faces and storylines again. I wish it was longer, I wish there were more scandals brought up, but it's lovely anyway.",1365292800,,295,4.285714285714286
