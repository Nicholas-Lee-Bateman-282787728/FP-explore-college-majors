2223727,1,B0007NXS36,"I am extremely disappointed in this DVD. I first saw this movie as a mini-series called ""A Matter of Justice."" The editing is a real butcher job.  A great move has been destroyed in this production.  I hope someone puts the full production on DVD some day soon.",1192924800,14,261,4.416666666666667
2223728,1,B0007NXS36,This was one of my favaoite movies and they just cut it up in a way that doesn't make sense to me I do not understand why they put this out on DVD if they were going to cheat the viewers.,1165017600,13,187,3.5853658536585367
2223729,1,B0007NXS36,I wanted the whole movie they cut every thing out of this one some of the best parts were cut out .I rather have the full version.,1163203200,15,130,3.8518518518518516
2223730,1,B0007NXS36,"I stupidly bought this DVD without looking at the running time. This was originally broadcast as a mini-series over 2 nights. If I recall correctly, the first part was 3 hours and the conclusion was 2 hours. This DVD is 105 minutes, which means counting the removal of commercials, the DVD should have been at least 3 1/2 hours, not just over an hour and a half!! They chopped up the movie so bad that the sequences don't always make sense- What a waste!!!",1150934400,33,456,4.440476190476191
2223731,1,B0007NXS36,"I also was very disappointed in this DVD. This is one of my favorite movies and I also couldn't believe how much was cut out of the movie!  I happen to know it is almost a 3 hour movie and here, it is not even 2 hours long!",1113609600,35,223,3.6458333333333335
2223732,1,B0007NXS36,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! I love this movie and can't tell you how excited I was to see they finally released it to DVD. I bought it and then anxiously waited for it to arrive. The DVD arrived and I quickly opened it and sat down to watch. Boy was I disappointed! I still can't believe they have cut so much from the movie. For those of you that have not seen this movie in its entirety I am sorry for you. For those of you, like me, that have it will be a great disappointment to you. Scenes that play a very big part in telling the story are obviously missing. If they cut this much from the movie to create room on the DVD for bonus material again you're going to be very disappointed. There is very little there to even call bonus material. Trivia: Martin Sheen tried out for Michael Corleone in the Godfather. Was born Ramon Estevez. Father to Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Cast Info: Consists of a few paragraphs for Patty Duke and Martin Sheen. Still Gallery: 15 total. All clips from the movie. How can this be called bonus material at all?  Since the only channel that I have seen this movie on is Lifetime or LMN with commercials I'm estimating that a good hour is missing once all the cutting is done.  If they did this so they can include the bonus material I wish they had just left the movie alone. Over all I am very disappointed with this particular DVD. I can only hope now they will release this in its entirety at a later date.  I wish someone had posted a review of this DVD. It's a total waste of money. I hope this review will help someone else.",1109376000,71,1569,4.205980066445183
2223733,1,B0007NXS36,After reading several reviews I am removing this movie from my wish list I too have seems matter of justice several times a and will not spent that much money on a chopped up version thank you all for saving me from buying this apparent fiasco,1412208000,2,243,4.304347826086956

2223736,5,B0007NXS36,"Final justice, This mother and father and whole family was dedicated to finding a son a brother  . It was so touching,to see this family grieving but yet  still  going along  to put it behind them. T go the extra mile in finding a son  no one seemed to know where he was..
this is a very good film .Patty Duke was outstanding.",1386028800,3,326,4.111111111111111
2223737,5,B0007NXS36,"Final Justice is a great film. Patty Duke simply glows with the character she portrays, a mother seeking justice in the murder of her son. You will never forget this one.",1373241600,3,170,4.516129032258065

2223739,1,B0007NXS36,The movie would not play so I spent 30.00 for nothing. Other than that all the other movies played and I was happy about that,1334361600,3,125,4.04
2223740,1,B0007NXS36,"Yes, DO NO buy this DVD.  It was butchered and not the whole movie.  It was a great movie I have watched over and over so I could tell you the scenes deleted.  I hope everyone else got their money back, I didn't.",1319068800,4,212,3.883720930232558

2223743,1,B0007NXS36,I love this movie. I was about to purchase it until I realized it was not the complete version. I'm glad I read the reviews first. I think this is the best movie Lifetime has shown. It's a pity they don't put the entire movie on dvd!,1301443200,5,233,3.978723404255319
2223744,1,B0007NXS36,"Don't waste your time or your money!!!  This movie has been cut and chopped to pieces in comparison to it's original film!!!! BUYER BEWARE........The seller doesn't bother to make this known in their description.  BE SURE YOU READ THESE REVIEWS!  DONT TRUST THE SELLERS DESCRIPTION ON THIS MOVIE.  IT'S A RIP OFF!!!! And, I have sent the buyer a written request to contact me to discuss this issue as well as, to find out how to return for a refund. It's going on three weeks and the seller has yet to respond!  Very upset and even more disappointed that Amazon would allow this to continue to be an item for sale on their site given all of the negative reviews.  I will never make another purchase without first checking out ALL of the reviews!",1297468800,6,745,4.522388059701493
2223745,1,B0007NXS36,"I was also EXTREMELY dissappointed.  They butchered an excellent movie by cutting it as they did, leaving out curcial parts.  There are huge gaps in the story line.  AMAZON should have noted this in their description!",1257465600,,217,4.972222222222222
2223746,1,B0007NXS36,"I to love the movie A matter of Justice, and I looked forward to the day for this movie to arrive. I locked my self in my room and I was the only one at home. In order to be disappointed. This movie was ment to be a four hour movie in which it was hacked down to one and a half hours if even that. I pray that the movie would be redone with the entire picture. Because what I saw on LMN cannot be described on the movie I received. And again like so many others I really wish I had of paid attention to the run time. I would have known it had been cut.
Thank you!

2223747,5,B0007NXS36,"This is one of my favorite movies, but thanks to the review I just read (wherein the movie was highly edited), I won't buy it.  This is one movie that I would want in its entirety.  I've already been ""burned"" similarly with a couple of other movies and I won't let it happen again.",1230076800,,281,4.185185185185185

2223749,1,B0007NXS36,"I was just about to purchase this DVD when I decided to look at customer reviews.  So this movie has been cut!  Thanks to all of you for the alert.  You've saved me return-shipping money, a trip to the post office, and aggrevation.

It then occurred to me that the title of the original movie was ""A Matter of Justice.""  Amazon sells that and its one review is good.  The price is more than I wish to pay at this time, so I'll just add it to my wish list.

Sliced and diced movies are most irritating.  It would be nice if retailers would add a lable to indicate whether a movie is complete (as seen on TV or in the movie theaters) or edited.",1210982400,6,642,4.08
2223750,2,B0007NXS36,"I have seen this movie on TV a dozen or so times. I was very disappointed in this video. Sooooooo much of the familar scenes were cut out, and one scene was added that, in my opinon, was not needed.  I prefer the TV version. I was not happy with the cut scenes at all. :( :( :(
Therefore, if you are an avid fan of the tv version of this movie DO NOT BUY this dvd.",1208476800,10,364,3.727272727272727

2223752,5,B0007NXS36,"This is an EXCELLENT story of how never giving up on seeking the truth prevails when all else fails.  Patty Duke & Martin Sheen are outstanding as parents who, despite their different views about what they can do to get justice for the murder of their son, come together in one of the most moving stories ever written.  This story and the outcome will be one that stays with you for life and renew your faith in justice.",1202428800,2,420,4.371794871794871
