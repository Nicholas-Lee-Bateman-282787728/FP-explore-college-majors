8423968,5,B004CYF7Y4,"The year was 1964. My routine was to finish my 2PM to 10PM shift at the Telephone company and get home to a late dinner and Johnny Carson. In those early days of TV he exhibited class, his guests had class and the conversations were witty and clever. They didn't rely on crude references to passing gas and other related bathroom humor. Everyone dressed appropriately and wierd body decorations were confined to National Geographic magazine. Johnny's shows were show business at it's best. For a glimpse of what was once a refined and elegant TV experience watch Johnny.",1366848000,2,570,4.826530612244898
8423969,4,B004CYF7Y4,"If you're looking for one episode of the Tonight Show to watch that has good guests and is a good sampling of Carson this is one to get.  However, I bought via Amazon video on demand individual episode purchase (4/6/90 episode) and the video is a few seconds ahead of the audio which really messes up the comic timing, etc.  I do not have this problem with other downloads so I think the file may need fixed or something.  If you're purchasing DVD, etc. this is a great set to get.",1325635200,3,481,4.263736263736264
