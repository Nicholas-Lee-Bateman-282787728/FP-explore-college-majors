7919778,4,B00004CN3W,"1980 was still a rather different time for the slasher genre. It had yet to really find it's identity, and it wasn't really until 1981 where the slasher genre really came into it's own, and how it's remembered today. During 1980 the genre would still put out some more slow burn style films, ones that would take a while to get going, ones that would try to add a layer of mystery to the mix, and ones that were still in denial of what they truly were. Delusion is one of those films. It's a classy little effort that's mostly rather obscure, and actually pretty good.

A woman takes residence in a mansion to take care of a wheelchair ridden old man. Soon enough a killer starts bumping off others who work and live there. But this killer doesn't like to slash, he likes to bash. With an old table leg. Will anybody survive long enough to find out who's behind all these killings?
Now Delusion is rather slow.  There will no doubt be people who'll find it too slow and overall uninteresting, but I actually wasn't one of those people. Even before the killer shows up (a little over the 40 minute mark) there's still stuff to enjoy in this one. Sure there's absolutely no action until the half way mark, but the acting is overall quite good, and the story is rather involving. The people and the plot were interesting in a stuffy sort of way. You actually wanted to see where this one was gonna go. It honestly kinda had an early 80's Jane Eyre vibe going on, and even a bit of Hitchcock's Rebecca. Though not technically up to those films (or anywhere near actually), it definitly wouldn't surprise me if they both were somewhat of an influence here. Whatever the influence, the film somehow works even on it's downtime. The kiler finally shows up and it's goodbye Jane Eyre and hello Friday the 13th. Now the film still somewhat lumbers along even with the killer doing his or her thing, but it definitly picks up, and slasher fans will definitly enjoy the 2nd half more than the first.
The film's rated R, but it's nearly bloodless, and it contains a bit of sexual content.

Overall I quite liked Delusion. Is it for people who like their slashers fast paced? No. But for seasoned slasher fans who don't mind a good slowburn every now and then, it's worth a watch. It tries hard to be classy (though a subtle layer of sexual frustration does give it a whiff of sleaze), but it's still an 80's slasher, and they're always worth watching. I'd even buy it if it got a dvd release.
Worth one watch at least.",1373155200,,2506,4.443478260869565
7919779,3,B00004CN3W,"This movie starts with a very old formula... a young woman comes to work in a rambling mansion inhabited by a variety of strange individuals, including a borderline feral young man.
Sounds like the set up for hundreds of gothic novels and dozens of suspsense films with gothic overtones. Well, 'Delusion' follows the formula nicely, if one excuses the fact it takes place in the modern day... and then people start dying. Is the killer the young grandson of the master of the house? Is it the ever-present flirtatious attorney? Or perhaps the friendly old cook? Or maybe the mystery of who the killer is is revealed by the title?
As a bargain-basement film (which this is), 'Delusion' is a fair effort... solid 'Midday Movie'-type fair. The actors in it are capable, the cinematography passable, and there have been far worse scripts filmed. It's about at the level of some of the chillers from the 40s and 50s... the B-ones. Its greatest sin, actually, is the fact that the title DOES spoil the flimsy mystery present here.",987379200,5,1024,4.790960451977401
