8220345,4,B000VWYJ72,"At about USD 8 per movie, a good deal. Especially considering you get the director's cut and final cut.

Prepare for epics though. All movies apart from Blood Diamond are about 3 hours (or 3 hours 10 mins for Wyatt Erp!). Blood diamond starts out grainy, but gets better. The rest are good.",1298419200,3,290,4.471698113207547
8220346,1,B000VWYJ72,"Wow. 1 good movie, 1ok movie, 1 meh movie, and one movie so bad Oliver Stone should have to personally apologize to anyone who's ever seen it. Save your money for something more enjoyable, like a root canal.",1285459200,,207,4.473684210526316
8220347,4,B000VWYJ72,"All the movies are excellent except Alexander.  This movie should have been swapped for ANYTHING else.  It is way too long, very slow paced, and Colin Farrell in a blonde wig is way too distracting to take him seriously.",1261440000,,220,4.615384615384615
8220348,3,B000VWYJ72,"Purchased this on 6/2 with free shipping. Didn't ship until 6/9. Only took 1 day to get here once shipped. So I guess when you pay for shipping, what you are really doing is paying Amazon not to DELAY your order. Other than that, great product.",1215043200,,244,4.326086956521739
8220349,5,B000VWYJ72,"As mentioned in the title ""Bang for the buck"" is the most best thing to describe this package.
Some warner classics that stand as a proper showcase material (Deserts,Jungles,Forts,ancient tales,history and fast paced action)all which benefit from Blu-ray's wonderful possibilities. As what comes to the transfers, It is all pure quality material encoded with VC-1 in its 1080P glory, What more would a Blu-ray nut need?

One of the best amazon offers to this very day !",1203811200,10,469,5.090909090909091
