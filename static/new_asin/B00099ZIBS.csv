2273982,5,B00099ZIBS,TOP OF THE LINE MOVIE. EXCELLENT SCRIPT EXCELLENT CAST. ONE THING THE SOUND DIDN'T WORK ON IT U MIGHT LIKE TO CHECK THAT OUT,1391472000,,124,4.208333333333333
2273983,4,B00099ZIBS,"This is based on the novel Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler.  There are many deviations from the text as is usual with Hollywood, although some were necessitated by differences in the art forms.  More significantly however is the treatment itself which is very different from the way Chandler handled the story.  Philip Marlowe's character in particular is not nearly as world-weary as he is in the book, and the Los Angeles depicted is not nearly as sleazy as Chandler saw it.  Furthermore the ending here with the prospect of a future romance for Marlowe is nothing like the cynicism that Raymond Chandler had in mind.  Yet, I understand Chandler liked this film, perhaps because of its popularity.

Comparing this to the remake, Farewell, My Lovely (1975) starring Robert Mitchum as Marlowe and based on the same material, I have to say that this is a more agreeable and entertaining movie, although not nearly as veracious.  Both movies really skirt around the racial prejudices of the times.  Here in Murder, My Sweet the bar Florian's isn't even a black bar as it was in the novel and in Farewell, My Lovely.  There is also no good cop/bad cop angle and nary a hint of police corruption--which is certainly anti-historical since Los Angeles in those days had one of the most corrupt police forces in the country.

But none of this bothered me--partly because I expected it, and partly because the movie stands by itself as an entertaining example of the mystery/murder genre done with an emphasis on a ""crime doesn't pay"" treatment and an upbeat ending--which is the way Hollywood used to play these things until film noir caught hold in the forties.  Although this is a forties film and clearly within the film noir genre, it is best seen, I believe, as an example of a genre in transition.

Claire Trevor plays Helen Grayle, scheming wife of a multimillionaire (and young enough to be his daughter), a woman who freely admits to having affairs as she tries to put the make on Marlowe.  No such luck since Marlowe usually prefers his whiskey to his women (at least that is way Chandler wrote the novels).  Here too Marlowe seems more interested in Helen's stepdaughter, played by Anne Shirley.

Mike Mazurki, who played the heavy in a score of films around mid-century, plays Moose Malloy, the big, dumb guy who is forever looking for his lost Velma (""cute as lace pants"").  Esther Howard has a small part as the alcoholic Jessie Florian, just one scene which she does very well.  In the Robert Mitchum film, the part was expanded for Sylvia Miles who got a supporting actress Oscar nomination for her work.  As for Anne Shirley, who was known as Dawn O'Day until she played Anne Shirley in the first Anne of Green Gables in 1934, she retired after doing this film and never returned to the silver screen.

What I think makes Murder, My Sweet (intriguing title, of course, but not really descriptive or accurate) work is the fine direction by Edward Dmytryk (best known for directing the splendid The Caine Mutiny (1954) which starred Humphrey Bogart as the deranged Captain Queeg)--that and the engaging performance by Dick Powell.  It's clear that the former song and dance star had a great time playing the tough guy gumshoe.  I think he loved the jaunty fedora he wore and the terse tough guy dialogue.  He fit the part (and somewhat rearranged it) like a hen settling on a nest.  (Okay, that's a bit of a metaphorical reach, but never mind.)

See this for Dick Powell, one of the mainstays of Hollywood during the thirties and forties, a fine actor with charm and a crisp style who made his first splash in the period musicals The Golddiggers of 1933 and The Golddiggers of 1935.",1115510400,6,3698,4.733229329173167
2273984,5,B00099ZIBS,"As much as I love Humphrey Bogart as Phillip Marlow in The Big Sleep (a confusing plot as there ever was), I felt he took a back seat to Dick Powell's incredible portrayal of the cynical private eye. I was very surprised that the crooner from the Warner Brothers's musicals of the 30s could slip into this role so easily. The dialogue was snappy and I was thoroughly entertained by the acting and the still confusing plot line. But I watched this fine film several times till I finally understood the characters and their roles. After watching it the second time, I went ahead and bought the film still wanting to catch the details around the edges. One of the greatest of all film noir films. .",1502064000,2,695,4.480314960629921

2273986,5,B00099ZIBS,"An excellent example of an early noir film that blends in the melodrama romance (allowing for the ""happy"" ending that is not noir).  Not as bleak as the 1941 Maltese Falcon, but a bit grimmer, at times, than the 1946 The Big Sleep.  Compare with the 1975 retro noir Farewell, My Lovely.  Note how the issue of race is dropped from this 1944 film but picked up later in the 1975 version.  Note also how the character of Anne Riordan from the novel becomes Anne Grayle here, and how the character is dropped entirely from the 1975 version.  For the pure, gritty, no holds barred noir, of course, we need Where the Sidewalk Ends, Asphalt Jungle, The Killing, or Night and the City.  If the detective ends up in a committed relationship with the woman he loves, then you do not get the full noir effect.  Down the mean streets, even if he survives, the real noir detective must go alone.  There's a bottle of rye and a pack of cigarettes, and a chess problem back in his dusty apartment with the pull-down bed and Venetian blinds.",1496102400,,1026,4.449197860962567

However, no one has yet to match Dick  Powell's take on the legendary detective. Powell's career was floundering when he landed this gem. His combination of cynism and humor bring the Philip Marlowe to life in a way that other great stars missed. I have always thought Powell's radio work as Richard Diamond brought something to the character that was lacking in the others.......This revived Powell's career and landed him many roles in the post WII era when the studios were dumping their hefty contract stars.

2273992,3,B00099ZIBS,"Acceptable but none too memorable adaptation of Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely. It's hard to adapt Chandler to Hollywood standards (romance, happy endings, etc) but this movie does well on look, feel, and adhering to the text when it's not shoehorning the plot to fit above Hollywood norms, which means it's ultimately a bit corny and dated. It's also hampered by a dreadfully miscast Miles Mander (in unconvincing old man makeup) as the frail but passionate cuckold who stinks up every scene he's in. This is the kind of movie I'd be grateful for having the option of watching on a long flight but probably isn't worth seeking out in its own right. For Chandler adaptations you still can't beat Altman's unconventional The Long Goodbye.

2274027,5,B00099ZIBS,"MURDER, MY SWEET [1945 / 2015] [Blu-ray] Near Perfect, My Sweet! Considered One of the Quintessential Film-Noir Films!

They say crime doesnt pay. Private detective Philip Marlowe [Dick Powell] knows better. The fat wad of folding money warming his breast pocket is the kind of thing that keeps him going through thick and thicker as he wades chin-deep into a mystery involving a missing necklace and a missing hoodlums moll named Velma.

Sharply directed by Edward Dmytryk, MURDER, MY SWEET is at most noir, creating a moody sense of a world that never plays on the level. Cast against type, Dick Powell puts sunny crooner roles behind him, dishing hardboiled patter and wearing five-going-on six-oclock stubble so well that source author Raymond Chandler called Dick Powell his favourite screen Philip Marlowe. Im just a small businessman in a very messy business. The Philip Marlowe observes. With wit and trendsetting style to burn, its never business as usual.

FILM FACT: Awards and Honours: 1946 Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Awards: Win: Best Motion Picture, Win: Best Screenplay for John Paxton. Win: Best Author for Raymond Chandler. Win: Best Actor for Dick Powell. A special scroll was presented to RKO Pictures.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In typical film noir fashion, MURDER, MY SWEET [1945]  opens with a flashback as detective Philip Marlowe [Dick Powell] sits beneath a police station's hot lamp and recounts the convoluted story of two women, a jade necklace and multiple murders. Based on Raymond Chandler's quintessential pulp novel Farewell, My Lovely. MURDER, MY SWEET [1945] features an unlikely Philip Marlowe, and the 1930s Warner Bros. musical star Dick Powell, is surprisingly effective as the jaded gumshoe. At the opening of the film, Philip Marlowe is hired by ex-con and thick-headed numskull Moose Malloy [Mike Mazurki] to find his vanished showgirl and lady friend Velma [Claire Trevor], who seems to have taken a permanent powder.

MURDER, MY SWEET [1945] is considered one of the first film noirs and a key influence on shaping the genre in its use of low-key black and white photography, its convoluted mystery plot and its depiction of a tough, cynical detective thrown into a world of corruption. Its box-office success helped establish the genre in Hollywood, inspiring generations of tough-talking gumshoes. It was also the first film to feature Raymond Chandler's legendary private eye Philip Marlow. Most critics consider MURDER, MY SWEET [1945] to be the most faithful in both plot and spirit to Raymond Chandler's original novel.

MURDER, MY SWEET [1945] is a taut film noir thriller about a private detective enmeshed with a gang of blackmailers, is as smart as it is gripping. With MURDER, MY SWEET [1945] it helped Dick Powell acting career, but of course was better known as a song and dance man in film up to this point, and with this film decided to change his screen persona to a tough-talking film noir hero in many films and television shows afterward. The MURDER, MY SWEET film also features Claire Trevor as a very convincing black widow and Mike Mazurki in his most memorable role as Moose Malloy.

Dick Powell plays Raymond Chandler's private eye Philip Marlowe in this second big-screen adaptation of Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled novel ""Farewell, My Lovely."" And of course Dick Powell was best known as a song and-dance man in classic films like 42nd Street, which RKO Radio Pictures decided to change the title to MURDER, MY SWEET, because audiences thought the original film Title was a musical, because it starred Dick Powell.

The plot revolves around Philip Marlowe looking for the former girlfriend of a big bruiser named Moose Malloy. At the same time, Philip Marlowe is hired to help find a missing jade necklace worth $100,000. Of course, both cases are connected. But director Edward Dmytryk seemed to want to make the plot the main feature of the film, but instead was more interested in creating lots of spooky shadows and dark rooms for his shady characters. Edward Dmytryk has the most fun when Philip Marlowe wakes up pumped full of some kind of drug, spreading a kind of foggy spider web across the screen to illustrate Philip Marlowe's total confusion of where he was.

The plot of the book is almost impossible to explain and it must have been nearly impossible to create into a screenplay. Actually the novel was a combination of three early Raymond Chandler short stories weaved together by the writer into full-length book. This is one of those films where the trip is much more satisfying than the destination because the story is very muddled and at least in my head- even after multiple viewings. Credit goes to the screenplay by John Paxton and the brilliant film director Edward Dmytryk for cleverly translating the cynical book and for rebooting the ending at the beach house to make it more satisfying than the novel. Most of the time Raymond Chandler never liked when his stories were rewritten for film, but despite this, the fact is that he also did just this to James M. Cain's book Double Indemnity a few years earlier. But in the case of the shootout at the beach house in MURDER, MY SWEET concludes much of the mystery, while in the novel Farewell, My Lovely the villain slips away from Philip Marlowe and makes the classic Hollywood ending that follows the beach house scene is a much more satisfying ending.

Dick Powell was not the only actor to resist typecasting in MURDER, MY SWEET. Anne Shirley and Claire Trevor both conspired to do a little acting-against-type of their own, and petitioned for the proverbial good girl Anne Shirley to play the scheming fatale and for  Claire, used to playing molls and floozies, to play the ""good and dull,"" that Anne put it, a nice girl. But to no avail: conventional typecasting was followed and the actresses delivered expected versions of their usual screen personas. MURDER, MY SWEET was originally shown in cinemas as Farewell, My Lovely, which was the original title of Raymond Chandler's 1940 Farewell, My Lovely novel. But audiences in the areas of its original release were put off by the title, mistook Farewell, My Lovely for another Dick Powell musical and stayed away, leading RKO Radio Pictures executives to rechristen the film MURDER, MY SWEET.

Blu-ray Video Quality  MURDER, MY SWEET comes with the ultimate compliments from Warner Archive Collection and RKO Radio Pictures, with a brilliant scanned 2k original nitrate negative and gives us a brilliant 1080p encoded image that gives us some stunning Black-and-White images, that really brings this classic 1945 film noir to modern audiences to make you think the film was made today. The black levels and densities details are outstanding, as is the differentiation between shades of grey that gives a black-and-white image depth and dimensionality and when we visit the Grayle mansion, the lavish decor is made to look totally sumptuous and spectacular at the same time, but when Dick Powell is waiting in the hall, to me in that part of the house it felt more like a mausoleum, but apart from this slightly negative comment, the Black-and-White photography and especially the optical presentation is totally perfect.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  With the audio presentation of MURDER, MY SWEET which is from the original RKO Radio Pictures mono soundtrack, but for us modern audiences the soundtrack is presented in 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono and delivers the all-important dialogue and voiceover with clarity and tight focus. Dynamic range is very acceptable for the 1945 era, and the thriller composed score by Roy Webb hits all the right notes. But when you get to hear the audio commentary by Alan Silver, the audio is presented in 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo, and it really brings out the sound in a really nice ambient warm sound.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Author/Film Noir Specialist Alan Silver: Here we are presented with the really smooth silky voice of Alain Silver, where Alain talks about how the film starts off differently from the normal start of the RKO Radio Pictures beginning, whereas normally when you start with the RKO Radio Pictures beginning, you usually get the telegraph sounds, instead this time we get the underscore composition by Roy Webb, which Alain compares to composer Victor Young. He also informs us that Executive producer Sid Rogell started at Paramount Pictures, who also worked with his brother, who also was a Director. But all the main people related to the film on the Credits were all under contract with RKO Radio Pictures. For producer Adrian Scott, this was his second film for RKO Radio Pictures. Because RKO Radio Pictures are well known for their depth of field cinematography, which they put to good use with Orson Welless film CITIZEN KANE [1941] and The Magnificent Ambersons [1942]. At this point in the audio commentary, Alain Silver introduces himself and informs us that he is a Producer, Screenwriter, Director of Independent Films and has also edited just under 20 books on the motion picture industry and 7 of them are of the Film Noir genre and one of them was entitled Raymond Chandlers Los Angeles. One interesting fact comes to light, is that contrary to popular beliefs, that there is not many Film Noir that features a Private Eye [Private Detective], which only a dozen films were release, and half of those were adaptions of Raymond Chandler novels with the character Philip Marlow. Alain talks about Dick Powell and how he started out in the Warner Bros. Musicals and then went onto be a director of 5 feature films, but also starred and produced several television projects, which had the theme of detectives and nightclub venues, and eventually worked in television much more, but when he did this film MURDER, MY SWEET, he had turned 40 years of age. Dick Powell did several more film noir themes which included Cry Danger [1951], Johnny OClock [1947] and Pit Fall [1948]. In the film MURDER, MY SWEET when Dick Powell has to drive out to the secluded spot and gets hit over the head and talks about the experience of the Black Pool, well Alain explains that Raymond Chandler in the novel describes this concept effect of what the Private Detective is experiencing and Alain feels that the film effects that the filmmakers rendering is pretty impressive and made a great impact on film critics. Alain also tells us that the way the police are in the Raymond Chandler novels and films, is because Raymond Chandler had no respect for the Los Angeles Police, because at the time of writing the novels, the police were tainted and could not be trusted, until the Mayor of Los Angeles had a massive clear-out of all corrupt police, plus Raymond Chandler felt the film MURDER, MY SWEET, was the best adaption of the novel Farewell, My Lovely, and the executives of RKO Radio Pictures decided to up the budget and of course it is reflected in what we view with this brilliant film noir. Another interesting fact we hear from Alain is that Raymond Chandler loved Court Apartments, such as the Barcelona Court Apartment in the film and interesting enough is that we find out that Raymond Chandler lived in lots of Court Apartments with his wife Cissy and we are also informed the couple moved 40 to 50 times over the course of 15 years in the Los Angeles area between the 1940s and 1950s. Another fascinating fact we hear from Alain is that Adrian Scott found out that the property on the film rights was ready for a remake and they actually made it as a Falcon Mystery and they turned Philip Marlow into Gay Lawrence in the film The Gay Falcon [1941] starring George Sanders and was the third in the series and after that George Sanders brother Tom Conway, who was a British film, television and radio actor renowned for playing private detectives and psychiatrists, took over, and when they used Raymond Chandlers novel for another MURDER, MY SWEET film Raymond Chandler got no additional  revenue compensation, and of course he was very unhappy about that situation, and because of this especially hated Hollywood and didn't really like what other film studios did to his novels, even after The Big Sleep film, his attitude did not change and one of his last screenplay that Raymond Chandler worked on was Strangers On The Train and he is the only writer in history of Hollywood to compel Alfred Hitchcock to come and visit Raymond Chandler, because Raymond Chandler moved to La Jolla in 1964 and refused to ever set foot in the Warner Bros. film lot especially to have meetings with Alfred Hitchcock. With the release of Raymond Chandler films, his original hardback novels started to earn royalties and amazingly Raymond Chandler only wrote eight novels and all of them have been in constant print from their original release and have been translated into 40 languages and is known to be best known mystery writer in the world. And so ends a totally fascinating audio commentary by the equally brilliant and smooth silky voice of Alain Silver, but what has made me very angry is that I have read other Blu-ray Reviewers say Alain Silver is totally boring, well how dare they say such malicious nasty comments and I would like to see these idiot reviewers try and perform an interesting audio commentary and no way would they be able to perform a very professional audio commentary like Alain Silver and to my mind he gets a very professional 5 star rating from me.

Theatrical Trailer [1945] [480i] [1.37:1] [2:09] This is the original Theatrical Trailer for MURDER, MY SWEET, and I have never seen such a bad quality film trailer, if Warner Archive Collection can make a pristine copy of the actual film, why couldn't they have made an effort to make the film trailer with exactly the same high quality as the 1080p encoded image of MURDER, MY SWEET. By way of interested the Theatrical Trailer had a specially written voiceover separately recorded by Dick Powell.

Finally, MURDER, MY SWEET is one of film noir's most influential standout presentations of its genre and still remains entertaining and accessible for over 70 years later. Dick Powell's rugged, charismatic lead performance provides more than enough panache for everything to revolve around him, especially with the ever-twisting plot from start to finish to keep you guessing the outcome to the very end of the film, resulting in a more fluid viewing experience that highlight's the film's smoky atmosphere and visual flourishes. MURDER, MY SWEET comes with a great film noir pedigree, especially for all die-hard fans of this 1945 film, and newcomers will be well provided with something totally unique and a very satisfying experience, that will leave you with a lasting image when the credits have finished. Highly Recommended!

2274035,5,B00099ZIBS,"Philip Marlowe: ""I caught the blackjack right behind my ear. A black pool opened up at my feet. I dived in. It had no bottom. I felt pretty good - like an amputated leg."" The bad guys - and the not-so-bad guys - die off like flies in this outstanding Edward Dmytryk directed film noir, adapted from the Raymond Chandler detective novel, ""Farewell, My Lovely""...and it has perhaps the most perfect femme fatale of any noir film. ""Farewell. My Sweet"" originally carried the same title as the Chandler novel; but the movie-going public thought from the title that it was just another Dick Powell musical and stayed away from the box office. I thought when I saw Powell's name in the lead as the detective, Phillip Marlowe character that Bogie would have been a better choice...but I was pleasantly surprised as Powell delivers a masterful performance. Casting is pitch perfect in all the lead and support roles; with Claire Trevor as the sultry Helen Grayle/Velma Valento; Anne Shirley, in her last movie role, as Anne Grayle; and the Hulking Mike Mazurki as the hulking Moose Malloy. Made in 1944, before films like this carried the film noir label, it likely was called a detective or crime thriller when released; but today it is recognized as one of the best - arguably THE best - noir movie ever made...""'Okay Marlowe, I said to myself. You're a tough guy. You've been sapped twice, choked, beaten silly with a gun, shot in the arm until you're crazy as a couple of waltzing mice.

2274044,4,B00099ZIBS,"""Murder, My Sweet""(1944) was released the same year as two other film noir classics, ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Laura"" and although it might not rank as high as those two classics, it certainly can stand on it's own after repeated viewings. Warner's has now released ""Murder, My Sweet"" on Blu-ray for the first time and the results are pretty impressive. Originally released as part of Warner's ""Film Noir Classics Collection, Vol. 1""  in 2004, this is the second film from that collection to get a Blu-ray upgrade following last year's ""Out of the Past""(1947). Originally released by RKO, ""Murder, My Sweet"" underwent an extensive 2K restoration from the original nitrate negative and Warner's has given the film a very high bitrate(35.00). Despite all the restoration efforts however, some of the film had been damaged beyond repair and the result was that certain scenes are less than stellar and appear in stark contrast with the rest of the film. This is apparent mainly in some of the process shots where white specks and softness contrast with nearly pristine scenes that come before and after. That being said, 95% of the film looks excellent on Blu-ray and film noir fans should be pleased with the results. Directed by Edward Dmytryk and photographed by cinematographer Harry Wild, most of the film takes place at night and this is where the film really shines now on Blu-ray with lighting and shadows being very impressive. The cigarette smoke is so clear that it actually becomes part of the scene and takes on a life of it's own. Costumes are very detailed with both  Marlowe's double breasted and Moose's checked plaid suits being especially vivid on Blu-ray. Close-ups are another delight and are so pristine that you can clearly see the make-up on the actors and actresses throughout the film. And speaking of the actors, Dick Powell is excellent has the world weary Marlowe and marked a turning point in the former song and dance man's career. He cemented this new tough guy persona three years later with his excellent performance in another film noir classic ""Johnny O'Clock"" (1947). He gets great support from Claire Trevor, Anne Shirley(her last film), Otto Kruger and Mike Mazurki(as Moose). Director Edward Dmytryk keeps the film moving at a fast pace making the whole presentation stark and unyielding from beginning to end. The Audio(English DTS-HD MA 2.0) has been improved also and is free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pop, etc.) that marred the standard DVD. ""Murder, My Sweet"" is 95 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37.1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include a commentary by film noir specialist Alain Silver and the original theatrical trailer. The disc itself is housed in a solid standard Blu-ray case(not an eco-cut case). Although not a perfect Blu-ray, Warner's has given ""Murder, My Sweet"" an impressive upgrade for it's Blu-ray  debut and film noir fans should be pleased with the results.

Also I'll add an honorable mention for Robert Montgomery's acquired taste Marlowe in The Lady in the Lake. But getting back to MMS (Farewell My Lovely) the film is just dripping in atmosphere and is one of the first full-blast films noirs, sharing the honor with Double Indemnity. But for me MMS has more the look - and more important - the feel of noir than Double Indemnity.

2274070,5,B00099ZIBS,"Farewell My Lovely, 1944 film

This is the film version of Raymond Chandler's ""Farewell, My Lovely"". It opens with Philip Marlowe being questioned by police detectives. It started when Marlowe was hired by Mike Malloy to look for an old girlfriend. Malloy had been away for years. Marlowe finds a dead end. Then a stranger hires Marlowe to ransom stolen jewelry. Marlowe is sapped, his client Marriott cannot speak. The police question him but Marlowe knows little. Then a reporter visits him to ask questions but Marlowe figures out the answers. Next Marlowe is hired by Mrs. Helen Grayle, the woman whose necklace was stolen. Malloy takes Marlowe to meet a guy; Jules Amthor is very interested in that necklace. They try to get information from Marlowe. [There are some novel special effects here.]

Marlowe continues in his quest for the truth. Ann Grayle hates her stepmother. Mr. Grayle was the owner of Marriott's apartment, so the police questioned him. Helen Grayle explains how Amthor worked: he talked to people, gained their confidence and their secrets, and used this information for blackmail. But Helen reveals her own character to Marlowe. When Marlowe returns to Amthor's office he finds Amthor won't speak to anyone. So now Marlowe begins to put the pieces together and figure out what the solution is, and returns to the beach house. There is a confrontation between the main characters that brings and ending to this story.

You will note how the film varies from the novel, but not extensively. The actions of Mr. and Mrs. Grayle seem more correct than the story in the novel. Chandler was a former oil company executive and knew about the lives and scandals of the super rich. The story of a rich old man marrying a young ""show girl"" could have been ripped from the headlines, then or now.

2274083,4,B00099ZIBS,"I read Raymond Chandler's 1940 novel, ""Farewell, My Lovely"" recently&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farewell-My-Lovely/dp/0394758277/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farewell, My Lovely</a>&nbsp;and wanted to see the film. Chandler's novel has been filmed three times. The first film was ""The Falcon Takes Over"" in 1942. The most recent adaptation was in 1975 in a film starring Robert Mitchum. The 1944 film I saw, ""Murder My Sweet"" is the second and most famous of the three adaptations.  Edward Dmytryck directed the film which features Dick Powell in the role of private detective Philip Marlowe. Although it is a detective film, ""Murder My Sweet"" has become a noir classic. It received several Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America, including best picture, best screenplay, best author, and best actor.

Chandler's novel has a complex, disjointed plot which cobbles together at least at least two separate story lines. The strength of the book lies in its portrayals of people and places, language, and atmosphere. This film version of the book departs substantially from the novel, but it shares the book's confusing plotting.  As does the book, ""Murder, My Sweet"" relies more on characterization, atmosphere, and dialogue than on the story line.

Dick Powell narrates the film in voiceovers and plays detective Marlowe. Before taking this role, Powell had been a song-and-dance actor. His role as Marlowe gave his career a new direction.  Chandler's characterization of Marlowe is complex, and Powell captures an aspect of it.  He is a sort of Everyman who manages to succeed as a detective almost in spite of himself through toughness and persistence. Powell's portrayal makes Marlowe almost into a bumbler and into a comedian while downplaying his toughness. It is easy to see him as miscast in the role.  Still, a strong element of Marlowe's character and gift for language come through in the film. I became more taken with Powell's characterization as I watched the film.

The movie also features Claire Trevor and Anne Shirley as the two femme fatales who compete for Marlowe's attention. The movie aptly portrays the tension between them. Trevor portrays the beautiful unfaithful wife of a wealthy, dottering old man while Shirley portrays his loving daughter.  This film was the last for Shirley, who retired from movies at the age of 26.

The film captures the atmosphere of Los Angeles in the early 1940s with its street scenes, nightclubs, portrayals of Marlowe's building, including the elevator operator, and police department. Much of the action takes place at night and the black and white cinematography is clear and angular. The movie includes scenes with a psychic who preys on lonely women and scenes in an insane asylum. In the latter, Marlowe goes through a remarkably surrealistic dream sequence. The dialogue of the film is crisp, hard-boiled, and full of repartee.  It is adapted directly from the novel in many places.

Viewers who are familiar with Chandler will likely know this film.  ""Farewell, My Lovely"" was my first Chandler book, and ""Murder My Sweet"" my first Chandler film. I have become interested in noir books and film over the past few years and was glad to get to know this movie at last. I saw the film through Amazon Instant Video and was pleased with the sound and the quality of the print.

2274087,4,B00099ZIBS,"Although there is a fairly straight line that joins the seven Philip Marlowe crime novels written by Raymond over a span of about twenty years from his grisly windmill-chaser youth to his tired out world weary and wary private detective in the 1950s that is not true of the various Marlowes in the film adaptations of Chandlers works. Of course when one thinks of the classic Philip Marlowe then the name of the tough as nails, no nonsense, grabbing rough justice wherever he can no matter the price Humphrey Bogart in the film The Big Sleep automatically comes to mind and old Eddie Mars paid the price for not nothing that bit of wisdom. Other have been suave like Robert Young in 1940s The Lady in the Lake, gritty like James Garner in 1960s Little Sister and Eliot Gould as ultra-cool and cynical in the 1970s The Long Goodbye. So there are many Marlowes to choose from.

In the film under review, Murder, My Sweet, based a little loosely, maybe too loosely on the dialogue and plot, on Raymond Chandlers Farewell, My Lovely old song and dance man Dick Powell plays the role somewhere between the pretty boy next door and the stand- up guy ready to take the fall for the client, if only the client, or clients, will level with him just once. Powells Marlowe here is set out to do two tasks before he is done-find ex-con Mooses Velma and find big shot Grayles damn expensive jade that had allegedly been stolen from the elderly Mayfair swell, or rather his young evil femme fatale wife (played by Clare Trevor). So during the almost two hours of the film old good guy Dick gets sapped, drugged, waylaid, lied to, propositioned, seduced, sent on wild goose chases, and plenty else before he finds Velma and that damn jade. But see that is where all Marlowes are equal-they don't give up the ghost until there is a little rough justice in this wicked old world.

2274091,5,B00099ZIBS,"Dick Powell as the cynical, world weary detective Philip Marlowe is so perfect for the role that one can't imagine another actor in the part. But aside from Marlowe, the bad guys are more interesting and more fun than the good guys, and the bad guys are quite a stable full of delicious villains. Clair Trevor is the two-timing blond femme fatale, Mike Mazurki is the psychotic hulk Moose Malloy,  who hires Marlowe to find his missing girl friend. Esther Howard joins the group as a drunken slattern, Otto Kruger is the sophisticated, smooth-talking  blackmailer, always seen with a flower in his button hole, and Ralfe Harolde plays the incendiary psychiatrist suspicious eyes darting back and forth. Philip Marlowe is plunged into a cistern of deception and murder and is obliged to claw himself out.

I did not select HD to download but the $1.99 version was clear and sharp. As in virtual all black and white films, shadows play a large part, almost taking on a life of their own. The scenes in which Marlowe is shoved into a lunatic asylum are very effective as the drugged Marlowe experiences a nightmare accompanied by surrealistic effects. Moody, treacherous, intimate, the camera fashions the scenes and draws you in.",1396742400,5,1227,4.889423076923077

Anne Shirley is great, Clair Trevor is pretty outlandish, and the goon in love with Clair is wrote.  Somehow I still like watching this movie quite a bit.",1519084800,,296,4.566037735849057

8058552,5,B00099ZIBS,"This 1945 black and white 121-minute movie is a very good film. It prompts me to repeat the oft-heard words: ""They do not seem to make movies as good as they used to."" It is about the private investigator Philip Marlowe and is based on a very good book by Raymond Chandler who considered Dick Powell perfect for the role. Until he played in this film, Powell acted in films as a singer. Chandler is right. Powell is perfect. He does not talk as he did in other films, but in short dramatic statements.
Powell is hired by a very large powerful man who had been in jail for some time. He wants Powell to find the woman he loves. Soon, the case turns into a robbery case when learns that a very expensive jade necklace was stolen. Powell is hired by another man for $100 to accompany him to pick up something. The man is killed and Powell is hit on the head with a zap. As the case progresses, Powell is hit with a gun, punctured with a needle containing a drug, chocked, harassed by police, poisoned with a narcotic, temporarily blinded by a gunshot, and faced a seduction attempt to have him kill a man. He is also offered a large sum to abandon his investigation.",1502841600,,1163,4.315068493150685
