8112553,4,B000EOXUNQ,"Hey there this event took place in Aug of 1986 the highlight match was Hulk Hogan vs Paul Orndorff for the then WWF World Heavyweight Championship. This was in the Hulkamania era when hogan was real huge and got way over with the crowd and Paul Orndorff was ultra heel. A great match between the two. Also on the card was Jake ""the Snake"" Roberts vs ricky the Dragon Steamboat. This was a snake pit match which means anything goes. Great Match, Steamboat and Roberts always had great matches together. If you Like the WWF in its hay day then you'll love this tape take care",1179964800,,573,4.415094339622642
