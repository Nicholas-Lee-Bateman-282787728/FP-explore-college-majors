8154526,5,B000K6UJBO,Great dance video.  Shawn Trautman and his wife are very easy to follow in their step-by-step instruction.  We love it!,1358294400,,119,4.9
8154527,2,B000K6UJBO,"I bought this dvd for my husband to learn the night club two step.  The way they teach it is way different than it is done in my area.  Perhaps it is a regional thing, however My husband and I are very disappointed!",1234742400,,215,3.9767441860465116
8154528,5,B000K6UJBO,"This is a good DVD for a couple who wants to be able to dance at their own wedding or other events such as wedding receptions, holiday parties, cruises, etc.  Dancing one of these styles is so much more fun than just doing the junior high style of stepping back and forth and from this one DVD and a little practice it is very do-able!  I highly recommend that Shawn Trautman instructional dance DVDs.  Shawn and his wife Joanna are excellent teachers.  Shawn does an excellent job of breaking down the footwork and also provides tips on style and leading.  Joanna does a good job on providing info on following and style- and she makes funny comments along the way keeping it fun.  They are very down to earth and personable and really care about feedback from dancers.

This DVD is a great place to start for an overview of four popular (and useful) ballroom and social dance styles.  Each dance is covered fairly briefly in one chapter.  (If you want more detail about a specific dance you could purchase a DVD from Shawn Trautman's collection devoted to that specific dance).  However, even from this one DVD we were able to learn enough basics, footwork, and rhythm to get out on the dance floor in public.  This is also a great overview for an ""advanced beginner""- someone who is already a dancer in one or more styles and wants to learn a new dance.",1209600000,2,1356,4.516393442622951
8154529,4,B000K6UJBO,"my husband and I have really learned a lot--enough to look okay on the dance floor at these social functions.  We bought one from a vendor on Amazon and one from the Shawn Trautman website--I think the customer service was better through the Trautman website--shipping was faster, and I have some concerns that the DVD we got from the distributor on Amazon may not have sold us a first quality DVD, the audio is not great",1199836800,6,421,4.5394736842105265
8154530,5,B000K6UJBO,"Do you want to dance? Start here. I guarantee you; this DVD is exceptionally well done. As instructional material goes Trautman and his wife are incredibly easy to learn from. I watched the ""Slow and Romantic Dance Sampler"" and was really impressed with the clarity of instruction and the helpful comments on dance etiquette. The camera angles shift between the male and female perspectives which is really interesting. You will learn enough of the basic dance moves to feel confident on the dance floor. I would eagerly recommend this to anyone who wants to get a jumpstart on their dance moves. Honestly, I believe you could watch this one night and be out dancing the next. It gives a man immediate skills he can use the same weekend. If you want to dance, start here.",1169683200,12,771,4.718518518518518
8154531,5,B000K6UJBO,"Like all of Shawn's DVD's that we have purchased, this one is also terrific for beginners who want to learn to dance.  This particular one is for slow dancing to many different types of music.",1167782400,9,192,4.485714285714286
8154532,5,B000K6UJBO,"My wife and I are new to ballroom dancing in the last year.  We've taken some lessons, but found that we needed the extra help of videos that we can use on our own schedule in our home and we've tried a bunch of them.  This DVD and the whole series of new videos from Shawn Trautman have been a godsend and much more useful to us than the others we've tried.  We are actually doing the dances within a short time and having fun, rather than getting aggravated with one another.  Trautman's emphasis on the differing roles of leader and follower and the very clear demonstrations of those roles have helped us enormously.  These DVDs include much more music and time to practice the new steps than most videos, rather than just watching an instructor do a step and go to another step.  We like this video a lot and strongly recommend it.  On a side note, the logistics/timing of shipping and subsequent email communications with the company were, after many frustrations with other online outfits, the best we've seen.",1165276800,19,1017,4.585635359116022
8154533,5,B000K6UJBO,"I highly recommend this DVD for beginner dancers who want to get moving in a social dance setting. Shawn and Joanna break down the steps in a way that is easy to follow, even if you've never danced before. I've been dancing a little over a year, and I had done some of these dances before. Even for those I had done before, it was a good review. The slow dance and night club two step are especially helpful for weddings, parties or anywhere there is slow dancing and you want to do more than just sway side to side.",1164499200,17,516,4.17

8154535,5,B000K6UJBO,This DVD will help you look like you know what you're doing on the dance floor--instead of just swaying side to side!,1164153600,8,117,4.363636363636363
