3618920,5,B001GQHJXI,My kids love these!  They are ages 3 and 10 and both really enjoy them and have their favorites.  We have had the set for about 2 years and they never tire of them,1359072000,,163,3.764705882352941
3618921,2,B001GQHJXI,"1st off... every story has two added characters that don't belong there and they just tack along! 2nd of all, the stories are not the same as the classic. Example - the Little Red Riding Hood, the wolf pretends to be a Marquis, and speaks with French accent. the story line is very different, as the conversations are. The main plot is the same, basically. Not sure why somebody would want to change those classic stories like that. And here is example of bad language, totally not a small child approprite - the wolf in the story has some ""thing"" in his empty hungry stomach, and at the beginning of it, the ""thing"" calls the wolf ""you, idiot""!!! What the heck kind of language is that for a 3-year old for example??? I will definately be buying the CLASSIC stories, and not these made-up changed-up stories!!!
Other than that the animation and the colors are good. That will be the travel dvd set, so when it gets scratched up or broken, I won't be sorry!",1346198400,2,957,4.474285714285714
3618922,5,B001GQHJXI,"The loved kids tv show Simsala Grimm on DVD in English. It has a different title on the cover and discs, but it is exactly and completely Simsala Grimm. Doc Croc and Yoyo are in here with all the fairy tales. Enjoy!",1345248000,,215,4.142857142857143
3618923,5,B001GQHJXI,This is an amazing deal: 26 fairy tales for very little money compared to Disney and others.  These are also kid-friendly and fun.  We often watch a few together as a family and enjoy the time together.,1345161600,,202,4.4324324324324325
3618924,5,B001GQHJXI,This boxed set of Brother's Grimm Tales is very nice.  My granddaughter loves all of the stories.  There are two stories on each of the 13 DVD's.  Very nice gift set.,1316044800,7,166,4.290322580645161
3618925,4,B001GQHJXI,"I love the DVD set. The animation is great and you get a variety of different movies for a great price. There is definitely an alternate spin on many of the stories given the addition of the main story characters; this may bother some people who like to stick to traditional storylines. Overall, I loved the opportunity to revisit some old classics and learn some new ones as well!",1295568000,7,381,4.536231884057971
3618926,4,B001GQHJXI,"These programs, which have appeared on Good Times Video releases as individually paired titles, are gathered here in a wallet-sized box set of thirteen DVDs, each with two 25-minute-long fairy tales on them, so twenty-six tales in all.

The fairy tales are all traditional cell animation, and feature familiar, and unfamiliar Grimm titles, including Snow White, Hansel & Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, and many more.

The animation is well-done, Saturday morning TV quality, and the stories are more or less well represented; toned down for viewers, but watchable.  The biggest problems are in the two ""added"" animal characters who are present in each story - they often intrude upon the stories in worthless, time-wasting ways, and lessen the impact of the original Grimm stories; sometimes they even change the plots, and characters' motivations.  For example, in ""Hansel & Gretel"", it's the animal characters who get the idea for leaving a trail of pebbles, not Hansel, and so his character appears weaker and less intelligent than he is the in the original Grimm story.

That being said, these programs are adequate for children ages 4-8, and are a good, thorough collection of animated Grimm stories for children.",1241049600,24,1219,5.16751269035533

8306650,3,B001GQHJXI,"I am not a big fan of this DVD set. The characters seem to be made ""cheep"" compared to Disney cartoons. My back then 3 year old son loved to watch them and my friends 4 year old daughter also enjoyed them recently. 3 stars are given due to the style of cartoon and that each time I play the DVD there is commercial/pre-views for other DVD products.",1439164800,,348,4.132352941176471

8306653,5,B001GQHJXI,"I started watching this a few years back on Youtube, mostly clips of the episodes and some of the episodes themselves but now that I bought this item and watched the whole thing, it turned out just as good as I remembered it would. I wish I saw this when I was a kid but I guess your never too old for cartoons like The Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm. I'm in my twenties now and I feel like your never too old to watch good old fasioned cartoons from the 1990s. You can love it when your a little kid, you can love it when your a teenager, you can love it as an adult and you can love it as you grow old. This is a piece of 90s classic cartoons.",1415232000,,648,3.843283582089552
8306654,5,B001GQHJXI,Omg really nice movies,1409097600,,22,4.75
8306655,4,B001GQHJXI,"After discovering that this DVD set was Simsala Grimm, I just HAD to get it after reading an interesting description on Tvtropes comparing Yoyo to Timon (Huge Timon fan as a kid). Of course, it's no surprise that Yoyo is my favorite character cause of all his sarcastic one-liners and the fact that he's super adorable. I also got a plush of Yoyo off the UK Amazon to cuddle with.

The box contains the first two seasons in English with a total of 13 discs with 2 episodes each for a total of 26 episodes. It's basically a book with sleeves protecting each CD. The only real drawback of each CD is having to sit through previews of Gary Busey pomeranian movies. Dinotopia preview sounds interesting, though.

Yoyo and Doc Croc provide a little extra kick to the stories that I love, being a furry and all. I highly reccommend this DVD to Simsala Grimm fans, children and furries but not to fairy tale fans who hate added OCs (Yoyo and Doc Croc).

Overall, my favorite episodes are:
-The Wolf And The Seven Little Kids (Yoyo is awesome and has a catchy musical number in that one)
-Tom Thumb (It's adorable seeing Yoyo and Doc Croc acting as big brothers to Tom Thumb)
-Puss In Boots (SO CUTE!)
-Bremen Town Musicians (I said I was a furry)
-Six Servants (They're like superheroes but without all that spandex)
-Hansel And Gretel (Just cause Doc Croc looks adorable as a bear!)
-The Meaning Of Fear (Once again, Yoyo is awesome in that one).

In conclusion, this show is like a plate of nachos and a bowl of cheese whiz. Oh so cheesy yet oh so delicious at the same time. I have to subtract a star because of the overly long Gary Busey pomeranian (Quigley) preview, though.",1392249600,2,1672,4.472131147540984
8306656,1,B001GQHJXI,Not the originals that I wanted. Really couldn't stand or get past the extra 2 animals they threw in the episodes.,1385424000,,114,4.476190476190476
8306657,4,B001GQHJXI,We enjoyed this boxed set very much as we spent almost eight years in Germany so became very familaiaar withthe fairy tales. We also visited Bremen and purchased some items as keep sakes avout the Bremen Musicians. All the faqiry tales are nice and really enjoyed by our grand children,1373414400,,285,4.72
8306658,5,B001GQHJXI,"This DVD set is awesome for kids. They are traditional fairy tales (Anderson, Grimm) with a twist.

Excellent for both boys and girls.

Animation is well done.

Wish they would make more.",1360800000,,187,4.78125
