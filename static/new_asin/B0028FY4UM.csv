8356203,4,B0028FY4UM,My 11 and 9 year old absolutely love this show. I'd never seen it before and neither had they but they like things about construction and this one really fits the bill.  It was on sale so I picked it up and as an inexpensive learning experience it really fits the bill.  The quality of the video seems quite good too as it is on blu-ray.  My only regret is they don't have a digital copy version with the disks so you can take it with you.,1328918400,,439,4.022988505747127
8356204,5,B0028FY4UM,"I purchased the 14 episodes Blue Ray DVDs for around $20.00 new on Amazon.com.  I felt program was generally a bargain for what I paid.  The programs usually did an excellent job of showing various stages of construction, or operating equipment like drilling or boats.  Programs were always interesting, but sometimes Danny Forster gets a bit under my finger nails.  He's usually ok, but sometimes he comes off a bit like a weakling, but other than that, he does a good job, and is enthusiastic and interesting.  My little daughter also loves the show.",1296604800,,552,4.829787234042553
8356205,5,B0028FY4UM,"This is a great set for those who love the series and also for those interested in the built environment.  The shows host can be a little overbearing at times, letting the audience know how scared and aprehensive he is about some of the situations he gets into, but if you put that aside, you get an amazing look at some of the most ambitious and impressive construction projects you've ever seen!  Unfortunately this is the only complete season available as a bluray set.",1271203200,5,472,4.607142857142857
