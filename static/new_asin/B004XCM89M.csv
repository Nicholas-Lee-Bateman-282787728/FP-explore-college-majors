4494570,2,B004XCM89M,"So many missed opportunities in this movie.  Anarchistic and vulgar without being spot on, sharp or well-thought out.  As I sat there (I would clock 1 minute of this movie as having any decent laughs), I regretted that the actors did not get a chance to sit around with the script, improvise and rewrite it so that the movie was sharp.  It rambled and it seemed like everything was done on the spot, lending a very loose feel to the entire picture.  Our showing had two groups of walkouts within the first fifteen minutes of the movie.  The high points are the action sequences, exciting music and fantastic production design and scenery. As is, I can't recommend this movie.  I read in another review that it was like Princess Bride but that movie didn't feel scattershot as this one did.  Liking Pineapple Express like I did, I really wanted to love this movie.  But then again I had the same reaction to Get Him To The Greek even though I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  In both cases, the second films seemed lazilly written and tossed off rather than finely honed.  If it wasn't for the pluses in the production value side, I would have given the acting and story a 1 star rating.  PS  The highlight of the entire movie was a character named Courtney, a servant of Danny McBride's character.  He played what little he had quite well.",1302307200,3,1340,4.556485355648536
4494571,3,B004XCM89M,"I had high (pun intended?) hopes for this medieval stoner comedy since I thought Pineapple Express was pretty good and you have the likes of Natalie Portman, James Franco and Danny McBride in the lead roles. There were a few scenes that got some laughs out of me and the crowd I saw it with, most of them the vulgar sort (this earned it's R rating many times over with more than expected levels of gore, the expected high dosage of foul language and a little nudity thrown in for good measure),  but overall the silly fantasy action element didn't mesh with the comedy. Some scenes were just really, really bad, while others were mildly amusing. Still, it's far from terrible and it might be worth a rental if you are in the right state of mind...if you know what I mean.

2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars (but I'll be nice and round up)",1302220800,,829,4.3076923076923075
4494572,3,B004XCM89M,"THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME MINOR SPOILERS

Pineapple Express was the first film by David Gordon Green that I had the pleasure of sitting through. From what I hear, his earlier films are entirely different and worth looking into. It's something I fully intend on doing, but in the mean time I love Pineapple Express to a ridiculous extent. That's one of the main reasons I was so excited to see Your Highness. With Green involved along with James Franco and Danny McBride, I was expecting something at least of equal greatness. While Your Highness doesn't really come anywhere near being as good as Pineapple Express, it's still entertaining enough to warrant a viewing in theaters.

The opening credits to the film may have actually been more enjoyable than the film itself. A giant Grimm's-fairy-tale-like book opens up while a narrator introduces us to the likes of Thadeous (Danny McBride) and Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker). After some shenanigans on their part, we're thrown into the opening credits full of illustrations of Thadeous and Courtney as they try to run back home to safety. The style of the artwork is like a colorized version of artwork you might find in a novelized version of a well known fable. It was really a fantastic way to open the film that fit the overall tone of the film like a glove.

The film seemed to move along incredibly well at first. The pacing was swift, but was just the right speed to keep the characters moving toward completing their quest while also being somewhat hilarious along the way. Hearing actors spew rather extravagant lines of profanity in a medieval kind of time period was funny in itself. It was just so out of place that it made simple lines more humorous than they should have been. The pacing begins to crumble around the time Isabel (Natalie Portman) enters the picture. It felt like everything the film had going for it was thrown away for immature pranks and attempts at getting women into bed. It's not like that didn't fit the storyline though as it fits the Thadeous character perfectly and it's definitely more his story than Fabious' (James Franco), but that could be the film's biggest flaw. It probably would have been better to have the stoner brother be a secondary character rather than the primary one.

Many of the scenes involving magic and Julie's (Toby Jones) scene in the forest before he gets disrobed were reminiscent of Star Wars while Marteetee's (John Fricker) gauntlet that eventually saw the five headed hydra had a bit of a Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome vibe to it. Then there's the ending that's straight out of Robin Hood: Men in Tights. If you couldn't tell by its influences, Your Highness manages to blend several different genres. The special effects aren't too shabby either, but the film introduces audiences to a few things you've probably never seen before in a film like this. While the minotaur manages to look fantastic, there is an interesting and unexpected story point involving the character that'll either make you laugh or groan in disgust. You probably haven't seen anything like a puppet wanting a tugjob from two grown men since Meet the Feebles either.

Despite its obvious similarities to Pineapple Express, Your Highness is an entirely different beast in comparison to David Gordon Green's previous works. The film is laugh out loud funny at times, but seems to jump further and further into the realm of immaturity as the film progresses. With shades of both Star Wars and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Your Highness may be an epic comedy on the surface but it also offers equal parts adventure and fantasy. While Your Highness may be lacking the strong storytelling of Pineapple Express and generally loses its pacing by the time Natalie Portman's character is introduced, it's still a mostly entertaining comedy adventure with its fair share of hilarity and sorcery fueled fantasy sequences.",1302220800,,3896,4.8969696969696965

4494606,5,B004XCM89M,"For some reason with the title I had envisaged some sort of chick flick princess Fiona type character led movie, but this isn't that type of movie at all. In fact Natalie Portman doesn't even appear on screen until it is half over.  I'm not a fan of hers but giving credit where credit is due, she is brilliant in this.  The main character is actually Danny McBride's, who plays, Thadeous a sort of overweight social loser son of the king.  He's not impressed with his brother's fandom and seemingly perfectness who is the hero of the kingdom. The brother's name is Fabious and with his long hair an obvious parody of Fabio the Most Beautiful Man in the World. So when Fabious returns to the castle after having beheaded a cyclops and rescuing a beautiful virgin trapped in a tower along the way (Zooey Deschanel), which announces he is going to marry the next day, Thadeous decides to drink outside the castle walls and boycott the wedding, even though Fabious asked him to be best man.  So Thadeous is not present when a warlock turns up and kills most of the men, taking back his virgin.  Fabious is determined to get her back and asks Thadeous to accompany him on his likely suicidal quest, Thadeous refuses, but his father the King, (Game of Thrones' Charles Dance) insists he goes.

What follows is actually quite a funny movie. It's full of crude humour and things like this but also a fair bit of action. Although the set looks kind of like something you'd see on a Saturday morning kid character show. But there is plenty of violence and swearing so the movie itself is not like those. At times it parodies The Lord of the Rings, Yoda, Game of Thrones and other movies involving quests, princesses and medieval type stories. There's plenty of other very recognisable faces encountered throughout such as Damien Lewis and Toby Jones.  Really give it a go, you won't be disappointed. Even the opening credits were quite fun.",1494633600,,1931,4.628654970760234

The production values are better than one might expect, and casting Natalie Portman as a sword-wielding adventuress more than capable of taking care of herself was interesting...even inspired.  The story is at times raunchy, even gross in places, but even those parts are humorous, even laugh-out-loud funny.

Is it stupid?  Sure.  Is it immature?  You bet.  Coarse, gross, and disgusting?  Yep, yep, and yep.

Is it frikking hilarious and quotable as hell?  Absolutely.

Do you get to see Natalie Portman naked?  According to the DVD extras, no, they used a body double...but who cares!

Rent this movie.  Watch this movie.  If you don't find yourself grinding up fairies to snort, and looking for a dong to wear around your neck, then I don't know what to tell you.  You're a boring person.",1468195200,,848,4.496688741721854

The evil wizard and the two good guys did a good job too, but really Natalie is the one who adds the most to the movie. I wasn't especially impressed with her as a heroine in Star Wars, but she was enchanting in this movie. I kinda wish they'd just make a movie around her character. Like a prequel.

4494783,2,B004XCM89M,"Your Highness
 Danny McBride intended this $50 million bomb to be a comedy.  He envisioned a kind of fantasy medieval version of Super Bad or Knocked Up but he missed the mark badly.  McBride, who wrote, produced and stars in Your Highness seems to have confused gross with funny.  Danny, sometimes gross bits are funny but bits are not funny mealy because they are gross.  Director David Gordon Green, who made the successful, sometimes gross but nearly always funny Pineapple Express did the best he could with the script penned by McBride.  The fundamentally unfunny script could not be salvaged.
 Zooey Deschanel gets to play a pretty girl in this one, which is no hard for her to do awake or asleep.  Sadly she is not asked to do more.  This seems to me a terrible waste of her talent as a comic actor.  Furthermore her best line is muffled, stepped on by another actor talking over her short comment.  This is director Greens fault.
 Another lovely young actress, and a personal favorite of mine, Natalie Portman, is wasted in this film.  An actress capable of such power in The Black Swan is given exactly nothing to do as an acting task.  She is required to disrobe, to walk around and spout inane words.  She is a subtle comic actress who has been given nothing funny to say or do.
 Poor James Franco as the heroic, earnest brother prince to Danny McBrides slothful, cowardly brother prince seems embarrassed and out of place.  All around we have actors who are playing well below their best game here.
 Your Highness has been awarded an R rating for language, situations and nudity.  The rating has more veracity than the claim that it can viewed as a comedy.  The film runs an hour and forty two minutes.  This two saw blade movie is not horrible.  We can watch it with a certain mind numbed enjoyment.  But it is not very good.  McBride as the producer of this expensive flop will be disappointed, as was I.",1424736000,,1919,4.560117302052786

This isn't necessarily a bad thing; I like vulgar jokes, but it isn't something a movie can stand solely upon.

4494882,3,B004XCM89M,"Even if I hated some parts of this fantasy comedy, I still liked most of it enough to not regret that I bought this DVD. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Thadeous (Danny McBride, a.k.a. King of Stoner Comedy) and Fabious (James Franco, a.k.a. Oz the Great and Powerful) are sons of King Tallious (Charles Dance, a.k.a. Tywin Lannister). Fabious is the wonder boy - Thadeous on another hand is a disgrace to the human race... Still, even if they are very different, brothers love one another dearly.

Then one day the evil sorcerer Leezar (Justin Theroux, a.k.a. American Psycho), the old nemesis of the kingdom, kidnaps the fair maiden Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel, a.k.a. New Girl) who was just recently betrothed to Fabious. The latter, enraged and outraged at being so suddenly dis-engaged, gives immediately the chase. In this quest he will be helped by noble knight Boremont (Damian Lewis, a.k.a. the red haired guy from ""Band of Brothers"", ""Life"" and ""Homeland""), a mysterious shield-maiden Isabel (Natalie Portman, who really doesn't need an a.k.a. anymore) as well as the very reluctant Thadeous and his even more reluctant servant Courtney (Rasmus Hardiker, who didn't play in enough stuff to earn an a.k.a. yet). Those last two go initially under duress and are very unhappy about it (""This quest sucks! I shouldn't even be there! I will probably die on this quest - Courtney certainly will!"").

I will not say much about the rest of the story, except that it contains a mixture of both good comedy and extremely gross and vulgar moments, many of the latter I didn't enjoy AT ALL. In fact, I would advise to skip completely the scene when the brothers go to search the guidance of Great Wize Wizard (a CGI creature, a.k.a Stoned Child Abuser...)

Now, personally, I am really not into the kind of humour offered by stoner comedies, ""Tropical Thunder""-like films, ""Scary Movie"" franchise and especially NOT into the ""Danny McBride, James Franco & Co"" productions - I totally, absolutely hated ""Pineapple Express"" (I will not even dignify it with a review) and I carefully avoided ""This is the end"". This film however I found watchable but mostly because of Natalie Portman's presence and yes, full disclosure here, partially because of her famous ""bathing wearing only thongs"" scene. Guilty as charged. It certainly says a lot about a film (and even more about its reviewer) when its appeal basically relies on one actress posterior - and it is not even her own (yes, I am aware that in THE scene, it is not really Natalie Portman's ""boot&eacute;""...).

The reasons for Natalie Portman presence in this kind of film remain as mysterious today as they were in 2011. Maybe it was a phase in her life, as she already considerably let her hair down in her previous film, the infamous ""No strings attached"" (possibly the worst romantic comedy I ever saw) - but whatever the reason, she certainly gave a holy lot to this movie, including some dialog lines I would simply not believe if I didn't hear them myself - and praised she be for that.

Now, as far as I am concerned, the main appeal of this film (other than the obvious SCENE) is the idea that even the worse kind of loser like Thadeous can have a shot at a girl like Natalie Portman, if he finds the right way to her.., ahem..., heart. Yes, heart, of course. Thadeous actually himself poses the question in the film in his quite unique way of speaking, appropriate to his quite unique way of thinking: ""What exactly would it take for one to tame such an adventurous slut?""...)))

Of course in real world, the odds that an out of shape, butt-ugly, slovenly dressed, foul mouthed, frequently stoned, cowardly lazy slacker gets a girl like Natalie Portman are very low indeed. However few things, no matter how improbable, are completely impossible and in ""Your Highness"" there are some hints at how one can increase his chances in such a contest:

1. Being born in royalty helps.

2. Being financially comfortable and therefore having a man-servant doesn't hurt either.

3. Displaying a VERY large penis is an asset, even if the afore-mentioned thing is kind of borrowed and hangs in the wrong place... )))

4. Gaining a magic sword and slaying a minotaur usually impress most females (except minotaur ones...)

5. Showing genuine concern and love to your much more attractive but already DEFINITELY unavailable brother cannot hurt either

6. Generosity shown to others (not necessarily the girl one is wooing or her family) is usually appreciated.

7. Kinky games with a sharp blade pressed against the skin are not always a good tactic, but to a girl who lives by sword they can be surprisingly appealing.

8. Outfoxing a woman who takes great pride in her own sneakiness can cause her to enrage in the immediate - but earns one also some respect, for later use...

9. Running around screaming with a big sword in hand and actually managing to hit somebody with it earns some points too...

10. Last but not least, it is useful to remember than no woman (and no men either by the way) is ever as formidable as she looks. All people have weaker spots, vulnerabilities and embarrassing secrets - and they can come in handy (pun very much intentional) at the least expected moment just before final credits... )))

Bottom line, even if I don't usually care much for this kind of humor and even if I found some scenes gross and disgusting (once again, avoid the Great Wize Wizard scene), I finally rather enjoyed most of this film and I am going to keep the DVD. Get a lot of beer, some nachos, cheese salsa and give it a try!",1388966400,,5602,4.7399794450154165

4494901,1,B004XCM89M,"YOUR HIGHNESS(2011) is a low brow comedy movie.  Most of the supposed humor is like ""Well, it looks like we are in trouble now....[insert obscene word here]"", for example.  Unfortunately merely applying a bad word at the end of a spoken line of dialogue does not make comedy.  You can listen to a badly mannered teenage boy who is trying to be shockingly funny do the same thing, and it does not word either as humor.

There is crude humor that is funny, I am not criticizing YOUR HIGHNESS for being crude.  I condemn this movie for being not working as a comedy.  The recently shown Rifftrax Live! SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS had some vulgar jokes were effective, and I highly recommend that film.

In fact, the singular portion of YOUR HIGHNESS that worked as intended was the part with the ""part"" with the minotaur.  It was dirty, yet it was very funny.  The bottom line is that this film is witless and uninspired.

The good: fairly large budget
  the minotaur(all of the ""parts"" of him) were very funny
  acting was decent

The bad: almost entirely unfunny, it failed to be funny aside from the minotaur

At about an hour in I was thinking to myself where is natalie? Turned out I was only 20 minutes in but man did it feel like an hour.  Took me 3 sittings to finish it and it's only about 90 minutes.  It had some potential, it was maybe the first time portman got to do a lot of action sequences not counting shooting a blaster in star wars, I tend to like this period for comedies as I loved robin hood men in tights and a knights tale was pretty funny, even black knight I thought was ok for a watch.

4494908,2,B004XCM89M,"Despite the presence of two of my favorite actors (Natalie Portman and Zoey Deschanel), this movie is not worth watching for most discerning adult movie buffs. Based on the liberal and gratuitous use of scripted-in obscenities (no nudity, however), it's not suitable for nine-and-under viewers.

The CGI special effects are up to the usual standards (""meh"") of contemporary B-movies. While Portman and Deschanel help to relieve the dreary awfulness somewhat, it's obvious from their unenthusiastic performances that they're on-screen because they both needed the money. At times Zoey D even seems to have difficulty keeping a straight face while delivering her lines. Having seen her perform on stage, I recognized her ""I can't believe I'm saying this"" smirk in several scenes. The film's editor obviously didn't catch it in post production!

If you're desperate enough for entertainment of any kind and buy or rent this fecal flick, the weak (as in ""nearly absent"") plot line, overly stereotypical characters, and trite substitution of contemporary American English trash-talk for what should be at least ""medieval-sounding"" English won't bother you much.

The casting was superb with lady loves played by Zooey Dechanel and Natalie Portman. The villain Lezar played by Justin Theroux was just such a creepster. Come on! It was seriously a favorite screenplay of mine. It is so funny and weird. I can't believe I waited so long to get Blu-ray. I was so hoping for a sequel but I am sure it aint ever going to happen.

Whenever a writer experiments with a new idea, like Mel Brooks early films, ""Young Frankenstein & Blazing Saddles"", it's a 50-50 chance you'll get mix reviews. This is a comedy movie, meaning it's time to have some fun. Not look at everything like a spectator taking everything so serious. The movie is not for family viewing or people who can't stomach a cuss word or two. That's why it was rated R. Too many funny quotes to post from this movie to mention.

4494977,5,B004XCM89M,"... this off-beat flick is a screwball comedy with no pretensions of being anything else- It's sort of half stoner comedy and half swords-and-sorcery spoof. It succeeds on both levels  and has verbal, character, and visual jokes that are delivered non stop!
The real gag, however, is lost on many.  This was clearly written by people who had spent a few years playing Dungeons And Dragons, and noticed that the personalty of the D&D characters was more similar to the players (good-natured  but silly, 100% passive, or grumpy, needlessly argumentative nerds), than the selfless, intelligent heroes found in fantasy literature.
This movie tries something new, and succeeds handily.
 Watching Zooey Deschanel  and Natalie Portman deliver terribly campy lines with straight faces and eyes full of mirth  is a treat. You have the feeling this was a very fun set to work on... keep in mind, this was made this same year as ""Black Swan"".  Some contrast!
The special effects are good for a medium-budget picture.

4495002,5,B004XCM89M,"Why is this rated as only three stars?
Because regardless of your age, background, IQ, race, sexual orientation, or any other number of factors I could list...

You are apt to either love or hate this movie. Hence the plethora of 1 star reviews in a bloody and graphic deathmatch versus 5 star reviews.
You can read every review in the world and never experience 'Your Highness' in it's full glory. I laughed so loud I honked like a goose at parts of this movie- an untapped ability of which I was previously unaware. My husband laughed so hard he saw stars and made a strange out of air gasping/whistling sound as he tried desperately to breathe and laugh at the same time. Two friends we watched this movie with also found themselves capable of stunning new feats of laughter, while two others sat silent and grim as they died a little inside.

Crude, vulgar, profane, explicit, illicit, genius, inane, uncouth, clumsy, inarticulate, horrid, hilarious, radical, stunning, brilliant, authentic, wtf, roflmfao... the graphic adjectives or internet acronyms you can spew about this film are as diametrically opposed as any that a talented wordsmith can illustrate. My friends and I are not unintelligent people and none of us are teenagers... in fact: the people laughing the hardest were actually the oldest of the group. With our collective ages spanning 25-42, more than half of us loved the movie, the other half were less... enthralled.
This is not your atypical satire as it boldly pushes boundaries that some individuals find extremely offensive.

You've been fairly warned, but if you have the stomach to sit through what you may regard as the worst film ever, I would dare say that comparing it to 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' is unfair to say the least. You may laugh until you cry, or regard the movie as torture. If you like combining weed and AD&D in a comedy: Watch this film. If neither of those sound even remotely interesting to your tastes... don't waste your time unless you are looking for MST3K-like material.
In my humble opinion, this is one of those priceless artifacts in my Blu-Ray collection I can watch repeatedly and still laugh every time.",1363392000,,2165,4.814516129032258

4495004,1,B004XCM89M,"I can only rate half of this movie because that's all I could stomach, and it took some effort to do that.  I enjoy movies that are so bad as to be funny (MST 3000), crude language when used humorously (The Big Lebowski) and even hokey adult sexual parodies (the old adult movie ""Flesh Gordon"" was hilarious), but ""Your Highness"" is beyond redemption.  It has what I can only describe as a fingernails on a chalkboard annoying quality to it that borders on physical pain.  It was without a doubt the worst half a movie I've ever seen.  Some professional reviews I've read indicate that, amazingly, the second half was worse than the first.

However some people clearly like it.  If you are stuck in adolescence and think crude language, crude sex jokes, and toilet humor are hilarious, you may be such a person.  You won't have trouble deciding; if you aren't impressed with the movie by the time it's finished with the opening credits, stop watching.

The digital effects are well done as well as the sets and most of the production value on this movie Is really high and well designed. Maybe this movie isn't as funny as lots would have liked it to be, but I thought it was raunchy and clever. The fight scenes are cool, the location shoots look great and there is lots of hot female nudity. It's a shame this movie didn't do better since fantasy epics are so few and far between. If you like ad-libbed lines and stoner comedies and fantasy movies, then you should like this just fine. The negative reviews I really don't understand. I've been with my girlfriend for almost two years now and I've yet to hear her use a bad word and she didn't think this movie was too offensive or raunchy. Sure it's not family friendly, but most of the best movies aren't. This movie is great escapism.",1348531200,5,1266,4.192622950819672

Second, it is a gory and bloody action movie, easily on par with Kingdom of Heaven and Troy in terms of graphic violence.  Third, it is a respectable medieval fantasy flick.  Remove the comedy and gore, and the remaining story is a tale cut in the same mold as Legend, Willow, and Dragon Slayer.  Put together, and you get a box-office bomb that is almost a cult classic on the home release market.  Everyone who sees it will remember it, and either love it or hate it.  The casting is respectable and the acting is limited or enhanced (depending on your opinion of the movie) by its script.  The dialogue is workable, full of snide jokes, swearing, and adult humor.  The special effects are original, believable, and serve the script well.  Nothing on the order of say a Michael Bay film, but still good.  This package is quite nice with both the theatrical and unrated versions present.  This package also includes extended, alternate and deleted scenes not found in either film version.  Just one warning, this is easily an R-rated film.

The brave warrior is played by James Franco; his slacker brother Danny McBride; the abducted bride by Zooey Deschanel and the sorcerer by Justin Theroux. Oscar winner Natalie Portman appears as Isabel, a mysterious warrior. Rounding out the cast are veterans Charles Dance and Toby Jones.

4495037,1,B004XCM89M,"Despite all its potential, efforts of lavish special effects, slew of highly talented actors and even seemingly promising trailers, `Your Highness' fails miserably on absolutely every level imaginable, competing with even the Transformers sequels and Jason Friedberg/Aaron Seltzer parody movies (truly ghastly comparisons) for worst movie ever. Hopefully the Razzies are taking notes.

Although I shouldn't have to explain the plot (because no one should ever, by any means, see this movie if given the choice), I will anyway for clarity's sake. Set in medieval times, Thadeous (Danny McBride) and his brother Fabious (James Franco) are both the sons of King Tallious and warriors expected to defend their kingdom from evil. While Fabious is beloved by the kingdom and excels in combat, however, Thadeous is lazy, arrogant and more known for his lust for women than slaying any villains. One day Fabious saves the virgin Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) from a tower, where she was held captive by the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux). Upon bringing her home to marry her, however, Leezar appears and kidnaps her again, attempting to fulfill a prophecy of a warlock impregnating a maiden with a fearsome dragon to attack the kingdom. Random chaos ensues, but trust me when I say there's no need for any explanation beyond that.

The film is bogged down by nauseating toilet humor, atrocious writing and juvenile, unfunny gags (unless you're under the age of 15 or a heavily inebriated frat boy, you absolutely won't be laughing once). It also really can't seem to decide what it wants to be; given the blatant tone of the trailers (and opening scenes), you'd expect that the entirety of the film would be a comedy/medieval parody (or at least an attempt at one) along the lines of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This is only halfway the case, as the movie makes sporadic pleas to be taken seriously, or maybe just desperately hopes to systematically distract viewers from the fact that the `comedy' is gag-inspiringly godawful. These embarrassing attempts at grounded plot are the most laughable moments in the movie.

In a particularly foul scene, the grotesque, pedophilic `Great Wise Wizard' (a bizarre Yoda-looking creature) insists that Fabious and Thadeous give him kisses and then a handjob (viewers are subjected to both). Thadeous also spends several minutes toward the end of the film sporting a minotaur's severed penis as a necklace (as if viewer's palettes aren't in need of enough cleansing by that point). How on earth the likes of James Franco and Natalie Portman of all people didn't have anything better to do is beyond me.

It's such an utter waste, really and truly, especially considering the genuinely impressive CGI effects in the final scenes. Given the trite material they have to work with, it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that even the handful of supremely talented cast members can't save this atrocity. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it is absolutely not worth a single person on this earth's time. Buzz Killington should clearly stick to Family Guy cameos, because buzzkill ""comedy"" leaves such a nasty aftertaste.",1332979200,4,3158,5.102514506769826

Your Highness also has a great cast of actors who have proven to be quite funny, and the story is R-rated and raunchy, the exact kind of comedy that has been extremely successful in recent years (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Crashers/dp/B000BKVQS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Crashers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad/dp/B000WZEZG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B002U5Y96O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>&nbsp;just to name a few). However, EVERYONE seems to hate this film and write it off before ever giving it a chance. Why?

The main problem is that it was marketed totally wrong. All the trailers (red-band or otherwise) advertised it as a stoner comedy with some fantasy elements, while plastering Natalie Portman all over the posters and TV spots because of her recent award-winning performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Swan/dp/B0041KKYEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Swan</a>.  Naturally, most people (myself included) were expecting something completely different than what they got.

In reality, Your Highness is a brilliantly self-aware fantasy-action flick that plays like a big budget sword & sorcery epic, just with some R-rated humor thrown in.  And guess what? It totally works! Not only does it work, it actually makes the film feel fresh and original because of it. It sends up the genre's clichs with such style and glee that you can't help but enjoy it.  I keep seeing reviews criticizing parts of the film that are supposed to be deliberately cheesy, and I just don't get it (James Franco's ""beautiful"" singing voice had me in stitches).  The film goes for broke, fully aware of its ridiculousness, and I think this tongue-in-cheek nature makes it even more appealing.

As a fantasy epic, it can hold its own. The gorgeous scenery matches the beauty and lushness of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;movies, while the elaborate costumes and intricate props further enhance the mythical world and convey a sense of realism.  The film's action scenes and stunts are equally impressive, which is hard to do these days in the age of overused CGI. There's a carriage chase in the middle of the film that is a spectacular showcase of kinetic, exciting action and wild stuntwork, all done with practical effects; it looks amazing. Special effects-wise, there is some CGI but it's used sparingly, save for one brutally awesome monster fight, and it still looks good.  I was also pleasantly shocked by the amount of bloody violence in the film.  It gets pretty gory at times, and I commend this.  Most fantasy films skimp on the blood and gore, usually because of their ratings or target audience, so to see a fantasy film that takes advantage of its R rating is quite refreshing.

The entire cast does a damn fine job.  Danny McBride's biting sarcasm coupled with James Franco's pompous yet charming personality make for a hilarious combination, while Justin Theroux delightfully hams it up as an evil (and highly quotable) sorcerer. Natalie Portman plays her role with intensity and delivers most of her silly dialogue seriously, making it all the funnier. The supporting cast is stellar, with humorous straight-faced turns from Damian Lewis, Toby Jones and the always reliable Charles Dance.  Zooey Deschanel isn't given much to do as the damsel in distress but she tries admirably and the relatively unknown Rasmus Hardiker steals a few scenes as McBride's manservant.

Special mention must go to Steve Jablonsky's outstanding score: it's big, it's loud and it's awesome. Jablonsky perfectly captures the unique sounds of the fantasy film scores of the 80's, while injecting his trademark orchestral stylings. For me, it's this score that really elevates the film from great to excellent.  Even better, the score is a great listen by itself. I've been listening to the soundtrack CD a lot recently and it delivers an invigorating experience.

This film is not perfect, with most of its faults stemming from its humor.  Some of the jokes fall flat at times, but this is common in most, if not all comedies (except&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghostbusters/dp/B000E33W1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghostbusters</a>. If you don't like that movie, something's wrong with you).  The film also overuses a few of its gags, but it's nothing too annoying.  The film is still very funny though, and the good far outweighs the bad.  I really can't think of anything else to complain about that isn't nitpicking.

So all in all, Your Highness functions as both a raunchy comedy and an energetic fantasy adventure that isn't for everyone, but worth look if you like R-rated comedies and/or fantasy flicks.",1328659200,2,5416,6.032594524119948
4495045,1,B004XCM89M,"I'll skip my usual plot summary, as doing so would cause me to lose the will to live. Suffice to say, Your Highness is a stoner comedy where brothers Danny McBride and James Franco have to team up to take on the evil wizard (Justin Theroux) in order to save the kidnapped Zooey Deschanel. A bewildered Natalie Portman helps out for a bit. Suffice to say the good guys win.

Your Highness is a movie that catastrophically fails on numerous levels. First up, it's a stoner comedy which is trying to make the 'add marijuana use to any given scene to make it using' formulae still work. The conceit here is that the film is a high fantasy, so characters breaking out weed whilst on a quest to save the world (or at least the female lead's virginity) is supposed to be tonally jarring and hence amusing. The problem, of course, is that even the serious Lord of the Rings movies had weed jokes in them, so this doesn't really work.

Secondly, the film's leads are rather unlikeable. Danny McBride (also the film's writer) plays Danny McBride, the quintessential supporting man who is best-deployed in short bursts (he worked quite well blowing up an entire jungle in Tropic Thunder and then doing nothing else of note in the film). He can't handle the lead role for an entire movie, and his jokes become repetitive and fall flat. He has occasional moments of competence, but no more. Worse is Franco, who plays his flamboyant, heroic role with all the charisma of a wet blanket, not to mention adopting a bizarre nasal accent that is seriously annoying. Completing a trio of ineptness, Deschanel plays her role as if she is severely concussed for the whole movie, a curious choice from someone who is actually a very good actress.

Supporting actors fare better: Theroux's ferocious, scenery-chewing performance is just what the script calls for and he makes even the most tired gross-out gags amusing. He also gets the best lines. It's therefore a shame he gets relatively little screen-time. Charles Dance, playing the brothers' fierce, authoritarian father (trivia: he was recruited straight from the set of Your Highness to play Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones), also succeeds by playing his role straight. But again, he's in the film for only a limited period. Portman is more variable, in some scenes phoning it in and in others at least trying to get into the spirit of things. Portman went straight from filming Your Highness to principal photography on Black Swan, which I suspect was a tonal shift so jarring it caused whiplash.

We must take a brief moment to salute Toby Jones, an excellent and interesting actor who in Your Highness has to utterly humiliate himself several times over in the pursuit of McBride's comedic vision, and does so without at any time descending into a towering rage and murdering his co-star with a chainsaw. Such restraint can only be marvelled at.

Another major failing of the film is that it seems to draw inspiration from other, superior movies. When a film is making you think of The Princess Bride, Lord of the Rings or Krull, it's probably not a good idea for the film not to be a patch on any of them.

Your Highness ( a star and lucky to get that) is not particularly fantastical (having a paedophile muppet wizard doesn't count), definitely not original, is mostly utterly unfunny (some honourable exceptions for Theroux) and almost everyone involved seems to be rather embarrassed by the project. The studio certainly was, sitting on it for more than a year before finally trotting it out somewhat sheepishly to the cinemas, where it promptly bombed. Definitely one to avoid.",1327881600,12,3624,4.781150159744409
4495046,1,B004XCM89M,"I've never had a problem with gay movies going as far back as ""Norman, Is That You?"" in the 1970s. You can couch just about anything in comedy and produce some good laughs.

But this movie failed. If the director saw an opportunity to insert homosexuality into a scene, he did and without any subtlety and many scenes were contrived simply to introduce homosexuality as good, funny, wonderful, etc. Sure, some of the homosexual scenes were amusing, but anyone who knows about conditioning should know in the first couple of minutes that the director is pushing his ""gay is good comedy"" agenda.

I don't altogether mind that, but the homosexuality is then mixed liberally with bestiality and a very massive dose of incest. Even homosexual incest. Parental incest.

Yes, incest. You want an ""incest is great and funny"" message in your movie? Here it is.

People can make ""oh come on"" excuses and give the movie a pass because it drew some laughs, but like I said before, a director can present any kind of scene and get laughs. Rape? Laughs. Child molestation? Laugh. Snuff? Laugh. Just because a director can draw some chuckles doesn't make those things ""cool and comfortable"" because we can laugh at them.

Well, INCEST is now all ""cool.""

INCEST, BESTIALITY, and so much HOMOSEXUALITY in this movie you wonder why they bothered with Natalie and Zooey. The two nice-looking ladies probably were only included for the trailers to draw in as many paying customers for this revolting message as possible.

What a waste.

By the way, if you are hoping this is  ""pot comedy"" due to the title, one actor puffs a pipe and squints his eyes for about two seconds. Pot smokers will find nothing in this movie attractive.

As for me I gave it one star, only because ""negative five"" was not an option... {BARF}",1324857600,8,952,4.485549132947977
4495052,1,B004XCM89M,"This movie is terrible and digusting beyond any hope of being entertaining or funny.

Let's see;

Minotaur graphically butt-rapes a slave boy? Check
Child molestation by drug addled puppet/wizard? Check
Genitalia-less troll running around nude? Check
Does it get worse from there? Check

And let's not forget the horrible British accents, bodily function jokes, pratfalls, and other items that may sound like they were going to be funny in a Monty Python kind of way but won't even make you laugh in discomfort. When a movie like this comes out it is obviously meant, in at least a small way, to be a parody. The ""Fantasy"" genre is ripe with clichs that just ache to be lampooned and, when done well, you can get an amazing comedy with wit and attention to detail. What this movie did was take the mind of a drunken and lonely middle-school pervert and marry it to swords and sorcerers. When this concept was pitched I bet the studio executives had no idea that this was what the writer really had in mind. When fans heard Natalie Portman and James Franco they figured there was a chance of funny if only to laugh at how bad they were for the parts. They certainly did not expect stories of children jerking off a wizard and Zooey Deschanel trying to devour a severed Minotaur penis. I mean, I didn't expect to be rolling on the floor laughing, but I at least thought we would see a competent attempt at comedy.

Crude comedy is one thing, but this movie should never have been made. This was a cheap excuse to put bad ideas in a bad movie and collect a big paycheck. In a film like this the characters need to play it straight and avoid over acting and ""nudging"" the audience to see if they get it. This was more like being smacked in the face with a dead fish and then having the fish smell described to you...for 90 minutes.",1324512000,10,1827,4.461077844311378

4495057,4,B004XCM89M,"Your Highness is as crude and rude as it get. This is low brow humor with little or no redeeming qualities, but it is oh so fun. Me and my hubby just watched this movie and I at times found myself wondering why I liked it so much, only to forget why I asked the next time I started laughing at it. Your Highness is a satire of your typical fantasy flick, you have your medieval like setting populated with wizards, dwarfs and maidens in distress. In one of the nations of this world the noble price Fabious returns victorious from his latest quest with a new bide and the kingdom rejoices as they prepares for the wedding. Unfortunately in the middle of the wedding ceremony a evil wizard show up and kidnaps the bride forcing Fabious and his reluctant ally, his slacker brother Thadeous to go on a quest to slay the wizard and save the princess.

Your Highness takes about every fantasy stereotype and makes shameless fun of it and the situations that arises are hilarious. You should be warned though that allot of the jokes in this movie is sex jokes, there are allot of (better not mention what types of jokes of Amazon's decency filter will come and eat me, but I do think you get my drift.) This do get over the top and if you are easily offended this movie is not for you, when I said this movie is as crude as it get I meant it. Your Highness is not meant to be taken seriously, it is meant to provide some laughs, and for what it is the movie delivers beautifully. One word of warning though, many think that everything fantasy is for kids, well this movie is not, trust me on that.

Now Your Highness is a satire, it makes fun of the fantasy genre in a way that make us that are fans of that genre laugh with it. I would however say that if you are not a fan of fantasy then you might not enjoy this movie so much, allot of the humor works because it makes fun of known an loved stereotypes and this aspect would not work unless you know the genre. This movie feel like it was made by fantasy fans for fantasy fans. I would also say that as a roleplayer I found this movie extra fun, we have all experienced that D&D session where the group where tired, unfocused or just plain drunk and a story very similar to this movie where the result. Yeah in fact that is a good description of Your Highness it is D&D seen through the eyes of a player that is drunk as a skunk and then made into a movie.

The actors in Your Highness do a decent enough job, this is not exactly Shakespeare and the actors have to deliver some insane lines with a straight face. The actors might not be at their best, but they look like they are having fun while filming and with a movie like this that is what matters. The music of Your Highness is forgettable but it do frame the action of the film quite nicely. The special effects looks good and the action sequences are very entertaining. Your Highness have great characters, the very noble price, his lazy good for nothing brother, the suck up servant, the brutal traitor, the stupid and helpless maiden in distress and the perverted white wizard, the strong but insane female warrior. The character who steal the show however is Leezar, the evil wizard, he is the perfect archetype of the fantasy villain who is even so evil that he rip the wings of pixies, crush them and snort their dust as a drug, I just can not get enough of Leezar, he is the villain you love to watch on screen and then cheer when he finally go down.

I loved Your Highness and I definitely recommend it, my recommendation however do come with a few reservations, if you are not a fan of fantasy or you can not stand crude sex jokes then you will not like this, also there is nothing serious about this movie, it is not there to teach you anything, it is there to make fun of itself and make you laugh and if you look at it that way then I am sure you will enjoy this fantasy romp.",1321056000,,3893,4.228494623655914

The problem here is while I do admit to swearing a fair bit and being an Aussie used to hearing this language still unlike what I am sure is the producers' intent, I do not find it funny the use of these words. The jokes are I think crude and not witty. Almost always they have a sexual connotation which did nothing for me.

The acting except for Natalie Portman's effort I found bad. Having said that I doubt she is the right person to cast in a sword and sorcery movie as a fighter. She does not look the part.

4495067,2,B004XCM89M,"This film is essentially the story of two brothers and their companions going on a quest to rescue a damsel in distress and all the mishaps and encounters that go along with it. The sets, special effects and cinematography are quite good however it's the corny, moronic and utterly crude script that totally ruins this movie. Why do producers today feel they have to use excessive profanity, vulgar themes and depravity to make a film funny ? Are we as a society that dumbed-down that we need filth in a movie in order to enjoy it ? I think not. I'm no prude but there were scenes in this film that were disturbing and utterly disgusting. Child molestation, rape and sodomy are just a few of the themes that rear (no pun) their ugly head in this film. What sick mind of a screenwriter would think this would be funny ?

As for the actors, well they do the job and are capable if not uninspiring. Natalie Portman looks bored and appears to be phoning in her role. It's a wonder she would actually agree to appear in such a low-brow film. Integrity doesn't seem to matter with some actors I guess.

Other than the above, this film has a few good points. The issues of self sacrifice and determination are key themes in this film together with companionship. These are the only ""good"" elements of the film which are ruined by the distasteful (and unnecessary) foul language. Worth a watch but is not a film for kids or adults with a low tolerance for moral depravity.",1318204800,,1464,4.479400749063671

4495069,1,B004XCM89M,"I didn't have any idea (based on the preview I saw a while back) what this movie would be like. Thinking this would be a medieval comedy spoof .. I wasn't prepared for the excess gore and violence. So this review is for parents or (squeamish adults like me) just to state the facts.. not to get into a discussion of the movie. If you are already planning on watching it regardless, then please don't read the rest of my review, as it could possible contain spoilers for people who like the shock of blood spurting out at them as they watch.

Whether or not the violence in this movie is done as a farce, doesn't matter to me. While my brain might be able to discern that -my eyeballs don't- and the images are stuck there. (Funny how, by pure coincidence, I was reading (the night before watching this movie) a review in a science magazine article about how damaging- scary & violent movies are for kids. One way shown through their research, is that it disrupts their sleep patterns. Also shown was how those kind of movies for kids have other negative effects, including on their forming personalities and their behavior towards other kids.) So I thought since some ratings don't often let you know the kind of the things you might actually witness on the screen, here is just a partial list to let you know whether you would want your kids to watch this:

Severed heads and limbs and fingers, with full blood spurting effects and complete with drippy stringy stuff, a scalping complete with full view of top of said head and two characters tossing the scalp back and forth like a hot potato, full body impalements on very big sticks (and later swords), cutting off a minotaurs naked genitalia and then wearing it around neck- just to name a few.

Also there are scenes with near rapes (with one involving an animal type figure) There is also a pedophile alien creature who wants disgusting things. So, lots of blood spurting, some nudity (both sexes and a beast) and lots of use of words that start with F.

As for my overall rating for the movie.. it is based on the fact that they so missed their opportunities with this very uneven movie. They could have made a really (consistently) funny movie with the good actors they had on board but they took another route with lots of strange ""over-the top"" parts for shock value I guess, and gore and chronic cussing instead of a better-thought-out and well-paced parody.",1318118400,4,2419,4.566820276497696

I mean even the actors delivered the curses with an ""excuse me, I say F*** here? Really?"".

While this isn't as bad as Highlander II it's far too close for any movie to be. Even if you are a lover of bad cinema (and I grew up with Troma) this movie will make you annoyed.",1318032000,5,479,4.150537634408602

4495089,5,B004XCM89M,"Strange, all of the negative reviews, and this is why:

The trailers made it as clear as the nose on your face as to the type of movie this was going to be. There was no guesswork. There were no assumptions to be had or conjectures to assimilate. It was not meant to be rocket-science by any stretch of the hyphenated word. It was CUT-AND-DRY as to what we were to expect from ""Your Highness.""

So why, in all that is holy, would the negative-reviewing knuckleheads even remotely entertain the thought of attending a movie like this and then expect anything other that what was in the previews? That puzzle is one for the high-thinkers, the philosophers, those involved with the aesthetics of human thought and its subsequent actions. But I have come up with a few theories of my own concerning those goofballs and their reasoning behind reviewing a movie like this:

1. They enjoy negativity and go about life on a day-to-day basis doing everything they can to seek out stuff to criticize and then following through with it.
2. They lack self-esteem and need to be critical of anything and everything that contains humor so that those who are subject to their criticism may experience a bit of what they feel deep inside of their afflicted, dismayed, and moth-eaten souls. It probably gives them a brief pseudo-sense of purpose, which, of course, is better than having to live with themselves and listening to their own poisonous thoughts for a brief moment in time.
3. They are big pessimistic bags of garbage, spewing darkness into the world on a daily basis, and they really should not be going to movies like this for the simple fact that, in their case, it takes MORE facial muscles to smile than it does to frown.

""Your Highness"" had no secrets about the type of movie is was going to be. And everything I expected from it I was given ten-fold. It was hilarious and very tongue-in-cheek at times, it was lewd and crude at other times, and it was bold and meaningful at, still, other times, making for an exceptionally executed movie, rife with hilarity and teeming with nonsensical amusement. The medieval backdrop added wholly to the film's atmosphere as well.

Don't listen to the nay-sayers, folks. ""Your Highness"" comes recommended to all those who can find their own funny bone without effort. It is for people of substance, who like to escape that substance from time to time. It is for the optimistic, glass-is-half-full type of person. It is for those who have no problem laughing at something that is MEANT for laughter and not lame, thin-lipped dissections.

All of the actors in this film were clearly having a good time during filming. Natalie Portman was a knockout and always seemed just a frame or two away from cracking up, and I'm almost positive she did many times after the director yelled, ""Cut!"" Danny McBride was perfect in his obsequious and cowardly performance. And James Franco pulled off the good-son, hero role with ecstatic ease. Other prominent actors were spotted throughout and played their parts with perfection. The writing was good, the directing was top-notch, and overall the production was A-material.

As the title of my review suggests, be a yay-sayer, not a nay-sayer!

4495091,3,B004XCM89M,"A predictable but fun fairy tale of an immature, whiny prince (Danny McBride) who is constantly outdone by his overall awesome brother (James Franco) who later needs his help to rescue his bride to be from an evil wizard. The humor is hit or miss but there are some good parts. The tale itself follows the typical fairy tale path and keeps you engaged well enough. Back to the humor . . . it tends to be immature, juvenile, bawdy, silly and even offensive to some people. It lacks the sparkling wit or ""aha!"" moments of PRINCESS BRIDE so in some ways I consider it a lesser version of PB. The making of this film was $50M but it made around 26M gross in global theaters and another $3M in DVDs as of a month ago according to one viable web source. Critics were unjustly harsh towards this film. I think it tried to be a number of things and only hit a few of them. In addition, the special effects were below par of what I would have expected. Fairy tale fans should check it out but for the rest I would say it might be worth a look at best.

And while there was definitely a lot of improv, it's not uncommon in comedy movies like this.  Either way, I'm not sure where the ""no script"" part came from, the movie was great and definitely coherent unlike something you would expect from something unscripted with too much improv.  The comedy is great, the plot is decent, and the special effects are passable to good, depending on the scene.  If you're a fan of the actors or a fan of unconventional comedy movies, then Your Highness is for you.  The style is very opposite to a lot of action movies actually... rather than a action movie mixed in with bits of comedy, it's a comedy movie mixed in with a bit of action.  The movie does stand up to repeat viewings as well, so this is something you could proudly add to your collection, rather than rent.

4495099,2,B004XCM89M,"Like me, the creative team behind Your Highness has fond (if not proud) memories of such fantasy flicks as ""The Beastmaster"" and ""Conan the Barbarian."" These movies spoke like no others to boys in their early teens -- heroes solved problems by hacking off limbs, sidekicks were clever and supportive, and you could always rely on a girl or two to drop her leathers. These were simple movies for simple boys.

With ""Your Highness,"" director David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") has created either an action-packed fantasy-comedy or a comedic fantasy-action flick; the movie can't really make up its mind. The basic plot is pure fantasy: an evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux) steals the virginal bride Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) from the heroic Prince Fabious (James Franco), and so Fabious must win her back against impossible odds. Along the way, he joins forces with the mysterious Isabel (recent Oscar winner Natalie Portman), a sword master with unclear motives.

The special effects and actors are light-years ahead of the movie's '80s-era progeny. If ""Your Highness"" had stopped there, it could have been an exciting, bloody good time (if a bit silly). Instead, the story revolves around Danny McBride's Prince Thadeous, the second-born wastrel son whose Falstaffian excesses cannot erase his shame of falling short of his elder brother. Forced to accompany Fabious on his quest, Thadeous never squanders an opportunity to make a fool out of himself, whether through bombastic speeches or terrified curses. Unfortunately, Thadeous almost seems to be in a different movie.

Still, Your Highness has its merits. McBride can make you bust a gut by raising an eyebrow and the movie has a lot of fun with the inherent silliness of the non-Tolkien fantasy genre. The actions scenes, particularly when a lesser wizard creates a five-headed Hydra in an Amazonian Thunderdome, bring the goods, and 12-year-old boys will award bonus points for the bevy of topless Amazons. But the movie's generally unrelentingly crude humor wears out its welcome; a phallic Minotaur trophy should be used sparingly, if at all, and the ""you must suck the venom from the wound!"" joke is just tired.

Mel Brooks once said that his movies rise below vulgarity. ""Your Highness"" falls disappointingly below Brooks' standard.

From the previews I knew that I was seeing the worst movie ever made, or at least, the most disgusting one. Uve Boll[spelling?] is know as the worst movie director living, so you know that amy film from him is bad or a mess. However YOUR HIGHNESS comes with Natalie Portman[BLACK SWAN], James Franco[127 HOURS] and Danny McBride[sorry unknown to me],plus the director of PINEAPPLE EXPRESS] all of which screams quality.  Then you throw in the previews that were kind of naughty but cute and what ia a person to do?  Well go see it or if not sure about wait and rent it, either way you spend your money on this ""thing.""

Where THE HANGOVER or BRIDESMAIDS were vulgar but funny, YOUR HIGHNESS is turns out to a waste of talent and blows the chance to join the ranks these naughty, raunchy films by being stupid.  So stupid that four letter words,disgusting views of the human body, the over the top blood become boring and jaw dropping bad. I am no prude nor do I always speak polite words, but the cussing here was so much that the cuss words lost their bite and served no purpose.  It seemed like the writer, McBride was one, said, ""Hey every second word must be a swear word, even it doesn't fit.""

All bad taste movies must have nudity in them and this film is no exeption.  There are two nude scenes, one with women and one with an unusal person.
Neither of these scenes is sexy and neither one serves a purpose as far as the plot goes. There is one scene that is a rip off of MAD MAX THUNDERDOME with a disgusting ""man"" in the Tina Tuner part.  Oh the monster here is so bad that it isn't even bad funny.

This is sold as a comedy with language but for some strange reason there is gore.  The killing is done of the top and is jarring to the audience.  It is like having FRIDAY THE 13TH in a Disney film.  And the trophy that McBride takes .....why ....yuck...and he wears it.

I now come to the villian.  The wizard with extremely bad hair.  I don't know who he is and that is a very good thing.  I made the mistake to watch the deleted scenes and there is one of his that is very sick, gross, bad, disgusting, horrible that I am happy it did not make it into the filim.

McBride was himself of course...kind of a dick, but also a lovable scamp. James Franco is charming as always, and has a way of portraying good willed innocent wide eyed charm like no other actor out there. Then, you also get Zoe Deschanel and Natalie Portman, two goddesses as far as I'm concerned.

But the fact is that crude humor needs more than mere crudeness to be funny. And most of the time, all that one got here was mere crudeness. The timing of the film was consistently off, so that what should have been fast delivery often dragged. The repartee and banter that should have been at machine-gun pace instead waited for someone to crank the crossbow back for another shot. (Best metaphor I could squeeze out on short notice; sorry ... ) The action sequences were long in coming and, often times short on the delivery. And, dear lord, the musical scene made me want to put an ice-pick in my ears. It too went on far longer than it should have.

There were some good moments, though, and they deserve mention as well. The direct interactions between the brothers was often good, and sometimes even touching. The pacing improved as the film went on, especially after the abduction, although that improvement was slow in coming.

Still, at the end of the day, this is not a film I'll want to own on disk. And given the nature of its theme and my tastes (or lack thereof) that is really disappointing.",1313280000,2,1263,4.502183406113537

(Announcer): Ladies and gentlemen, Universal Pictures and Stuber Productions, present a spectacular new film titled 'Your Highness'. Starring Oscar winner Natalie Portman, Oscar nominee James Franco, with talents of the insanely hysterical Danny McBride.

There were some amusing moments. But this is clearly Director David Gordon Green's attempt to recapture lightning in a bottle. Taking his surprise breakout hit '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pineapple-Express/dp/B001J9KJ4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pineapple Express</a>' and inserting the PE formula into a medieval theme - and that didn't work.

From IMDb's Trivia Section: ""Although the film was written by Ben Best and Danny McBride, the dialogue is heavily improvised. Director Green said there was never a script used on-set. Only the plot outline and written notes were used.""

It shows.

The special effects are serviceable, but not really amazing. The script is terrific, the action is OK but never stops, the gags are well placed.

4495138,2,B004XCM89M,"I had this movie on my list of ones to check out this summer along with Super 8, Captain America, and all the other films with blockbuster buzz because many of the same ingredients that made Pineapple Express were there. It had Danny McBride, James Franco, and it was a stoner action film. I thought Pineapple Express was hilarious, but I have to admit that wasn't my initial assessment. At first, I disliked Pineapple Express because it seemed like it couldn't decide how serious it wanted to take itself, but it just got better upon repeat viewings; the action started to seem more appropriate for the story and the dialogue only got funnier the more I thought about how it was delivered.

Sadly, acquiring the taste to enjoy Pineapple Express didn't allow me to be satisfied by Your Highness on the first viewing, and I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters or purchase this one. There's more action in this one and it's passable, but it leaves less time for the comedy, or perhaps it simply didn't blend as well. There was more than one action scene in Pineapple Express where Seth Rogan puts his terrible fighting skills to use, so there was a comedic slant to the action, but there's less of that here. Also, essentially all of the best parts were in the red band trailer, which is always sad.

This is not a parody. It's written as a straightout fantasy adventure. The protagonist played by Danny McBride is so incredibly self-centered though that he is a comical character. Everyone else has to more or less play it straight, but that's part of the humor.
I had to see this because I loved the trailer for Your Highness and upon the film's release it was universally panned, except for the Edelstein review. Fascinating.

4495171,3,B004XCM89M,"David Gordon Green Danny McBride, and James Franco struck gold with PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, a stoner comedy for the new age (personally, I only thought it was so-so, but that's my humble opinion).  Naturally, when you have a critically- and commercially-successful film about smoking pot, it raises the question: what if we did a stoner comedy set in the Middle Ages?

The result is the rambling, imperfect, but occasionally hilarious YOUR HIGHNESS.  It follows to brothers: bumbling Thadeus (McBride) and heroic Fabious (Franco), the latter of whose wife (Zooey Deschanel) is kidnapped by an evil sorcerer (Justin Theroux).  The two brothers set out to find the princess, teaming up along the way with a Xena-wannabe (Natalie Portman).  They encounter monsters, mayhem, and horny minotaurs.  And that's just for starters.

There are a lot of laughs in YOUR HIGHNESS--a lot of truly low-brow, jaw-hurting laughs, the kind you find yourself quoting to your buddy: ""Hey, remember the part when...?""  The problem is, the movie in its entirety just seems...two-dimensional.  Whether you liked it or didn't, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS at least had some decent character development to it, and solid chemistry between Seth Rogen and Franco.  McBride and Franco's chemistry is interesting but not too deep; and Portman seems to be on a completely different plane than either of her costars.  Theroux doesn't seem to quite know what to do (he's great in some spots, shoddy in others), and Deschanel literally has nothing to do except look pretty and act distressed.  There are some great supporting players here (Toby Jones, Charles Dance, Damian Lewis), but this isn't an actors' film: it's a writer's film, an improv film, and as such, great acting talent has minimal effect.

So why the three stars, you're wondering?  Mainly because, when those gut-bursting laughs come, they're fantastic.  You can see most of them coming a mile away, but the payoff is still there.  If I were to classify this film, I'd list it as a rental (if anyone truly ""rents"" anymore), and you can take it from there.  YOUR HIGHNESS isn't the greatest stoner comedy of all time, but it's certainly not as bad as critics seemed to suggest.

When Fabious' (Franco) fiance (Zooey Dachanel) is captured by the evil wizard Leezar, he and his brother Thadious (McBride) must set off on mighty quest to win her back and foil Leezar's (expectedly gross) evil plans!

Along their journey, the brothers meet a cast of funny and totally inappropriate characters that include a mighty warrior woman (Natalie Portman), a molesting wizard, and a *ahem* well-endowed, frisky Minotaur. Their new friends and foes lend them strength in one form or another all leading up to the climax as they face off against the mighty and evil Leezar.

All-in-all, Your Highness is an excellent example of how a raunchy comedy is supposed to be made. You take one part A-list talent (Portman, Franco) and mix it with one part up-and-comer (McBride), add generous amounts of gross-out jokes in between good bouts of action  and let it all stew in a medieval setting.

If you like Pineapple Express, East Bound and Down and Lord of the Rings you will love this movie.  At least that is the case for me.  Your Highness takes beautiful scenery (and people) and adds comedy up to par with Eastbound and Pineapple Express.

I don't like raunchy humor, which seems to be a complaint about the movie, and to me a lot of the comedy isn't raunchy.  I don't consider smart raunchy to be raunchy.  Having Danny McBride SPOILER cut off a minotaurs penis and wear it as a trophy only to be almost sucked on by James Francos future bride cause a horny spell was casted on her is funny!(You don't know where that's been!)  Reading it might sound raunchy but on screen it's genius and hilarious.  (Eastbound and Down is more ""raunchy"" than Your Highness)

Another reason why this movie is good is because it's one of the very few fantasy comedies that exist.  It doesn't make fun of the fantasy genre, it uses it.  Your Highness sets up a magical world that is a legit fantasy movie even if it wasn't a comedy.  It just so happens to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.

Because I'm sorry, but let's face it; this movie was NOT funny.

I recall when I went to the theater to see this movie.  I was really stoked, I figured that two of the guys and the director from Pineapple Express--set in medieval times--would be a riot!  I was wrong, though.  I can't recall a single person in the screening that laughed even once... except for two people in the back.  During one scene.  That was in the trailer.  It was actually painful to sit through.

I can't think of anything redeeming about this crapfest comedy revolving around some lazy prince and his brother (McBride and James Franco, respectively) going on a journey to kill some sorcerer or something.  And Natalie Portman's in there somewhere.  She even had an attitude in her performance that screamed ""where's my damn paycheck already?""  So's that Zooey Deschanel chick.

McBride stars as Prince Thadeous, the cowardly brother of the heroic Prince Fabious, who is about to marry the wide-eyed virgin Belladonna when lo and behold, the villainous wizard Leezar kidnaps her and traps her in a tower like Rapunzel.

Of course, that's the cue for Fabious to take Thadeous and his manservant Courtney to search for her with the aid of a band of knights who soon betray him. Although this is a medieval story with the appropriate sets and costumes, not much of the script is played to period.

Meanwhile, James Franco plays Fabious with his slightly askew, surfer-dude manner intact, while Zooey Deschanel plays Belladonna with only a modicum of her usually ironic delivery. As Leezar, Justin Theroux has a field day with the wizard's grandiose manner and lascivious intensity.

Rasmus Hardiker manages to give dimension to the seemingly enfeebled Courtney who inexplicably remains devoted to Thadeous despite the constant humiliation he experiences.

4495189,1,B004XCM89M,"Your Highness is a movie, if there ever is one, that is an insult to the words ""Gross-out"" and ""comedy"" and the dash between the first two words. What's even more insulting is the fact that it came from such a talented director, David Gordon Green. That guy directed Pineapple Express, and a number of lower-key serious ones that are worth mention as well. But alas, Your Highness is an ultimately unfunny embarrassment of a film that makes the god-awful ""Step Brothers"" look hilarious.

The film's story is set in Medieval England and basically revolves around Thadeous, a lazy and fat stoner slob with a successful brother, Fabious. Fabious has just returned from saving his wife, Belladonna, from an evil wizard with three moms called Lezarre. As they are about to get married, on the wedding day, Lezarre kidnaps Belladonna and brings her back to his castle for the sole purpose of deflowering her, with the help of his three mothers. They take some guy I couldn't care about named Courtney as they go on their quest. Their quest includes many things such as masturbating a wizard creature thingy, ending up in a trap and blah blah blah... yeah.

That's about as much of a story you'll get from Your Highness. Because much of the film's potential to have a good story is wasted on jokes about sex, paedophilia, wearing a monster penis around your neck and a whole bunch of other gross and raunchy stuff that's too raunchy to be funny, and too dull to be even considered humour, even unfunny humour at that. The film basically subjects its audience to such nasty and gross stuff for the entire duration, and while I love gross-out humour, there's a fine line between gross and funny.

That's not to say there wasn't any funny moments, because there were, in fact, two: One where Thadeous goes around, stoned out of his mind, chasing sheep, and another being where they are under attack in a ritual including a beast which is controlled by a fat man's hand. I'm not gonna lie, I just spent 20 minutes trying to remember the parts I did think were funny. That's never a good sign. There were a couple chortles as well, but I can't even remember those parts. There's an incredible amount of gory violence in the film too, but the only reason the gore is so shocking is because of the rest of the film being so static and blas. Despite the violence, the film is not much of an action movie. Problem is, it's not much of a comedy either, at least to people who know what funny actually means.

Overall, while this film is rated 18A in Canada, I find mys elf about 6 years past its intended target audience- that is, 14 year old tweens who find jokes about baby rape and other disgusting stuff funny. And mind you, I've been known around my friends as the one with the incredibly sick and twisted sense of humour, but even still, this film is just not funny. I would definitely recommend staying away from this flick, no matter how much you love gross humour or sick and twisted stuff.",1302480000,13,2982,4.557835820895522

What just happened there?

Why am I laughing?

What, in the vernacular, the (...ahem) ""heavens"" was that?

Your Highness is wrong on so many levels. It ought to be a disaster. For reasons I can't fathom, it isn't. It is absurd, gratuitous, vulgar, childish, stupid and utterly incongruous. And I thought it was great.

Natalie Portman playing against Danny McBride: what kind of fevered imagination comes up with that sort of an idea? What sort of miracle worker makes it actually happen? What sort of genius makes it work?

You don't blow millions on Industrial Light & Magic style digital effects one moment and then fill the screen with a cheap rubber alien wizard (a dope-smoking, kiddie-fiddling alien wizard at that) that looks like it came from a joke shop the next. You can't rely on non-expectant swearing and expect to get away with it. At least, not fifty times. But all in all, it seems to work.

Danny McBride - last seen heading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eastbound-and-Down/dp/B001IBIDLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eastbound and Down</a>, more or less reprises Kenny Powers, complete with mullet and goatee (no method actor, Mr McBride, I dare say), only here he is a useless younger prince in a mediaeval kingdom in a land far, far, far away. On a different planet, indeed: there is a twin moon, and it is important to the plot (I suppose you could call it a plot).

Unlike most mediaeval kingdoms this is one where everyone intones smutty innuendos with English accents that come and go like rotating speakers. Kenny - I mean, Thadeous - is more or less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Adder/dp/B00005A1ST/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Adder</a>&nbsp;to Fabious' Prince Harry. Fabious (James Franco, swashing his buckles for all he is worth and for some reason channelling Steve Tyler from Aerosmith) has a whale of a time as a slightly dopey hunk. They are pitted against evil warlock Leezar (a superb Justin Theroux) a criminally under-explained villain who has bad teeth, worse hair, and who also has a whale of a time, vacillating between occult power and sexual impotence (there are knob jokes aplenty here). Theroux' delivery of his actually pretty ordinary material is spot on.

Along the way there are entirely gratuitous scenes of every dimension: sand-encrusted nude barbarian vixens in the thrall of a large fat pink sorcerer (John Fricker) in a nappy, in a Thunderdome. Much violence, and more gay innuendo. Did I mention there are lots of willie jokes? There are the occasional outrageous visual gags. There's a frisky minotaur. There is a scheduled coming together of the moons which will result in a rare event called ... - well, you'll just have to see it, because I don't want to spoil it. Totally immature, but still I just about wet myself.

Natalie Portman boxes on far more gamely than anyone has any right to expect a recently minted Oscar laureate to. I constantly found myself wondering what on earth had possessed her to sign up for this project - perhaps relaxation therapy after a long dose of Darren Aronofsky - but being eternally grateful that she had. She is a tremendous sport throughout, and my regard for her is undoubtedly enhanced.

I have complained in these pages about the reliance on rote, formula and technology in place of proper drama in modern motion pictures. No complaints on that score here: while there's absolutely no proper drama on speak of, you couldn't fault David Gordon Green and his team for showing a bit of spirit. Instead of a tightly followed plan, there's no plan at all (Do you think my methods are unsound? I don't see any method at all, sir).

But when the alternative that passes for comedy these days is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-The-Spartans/dp/B00177Y9ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet The Spartans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Riding-Hood/dp/B000EXDS4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Riding Hood</a>&nbsp;(At least, I can only assume that's intended to be a comedy) then this has to come well recommended.

Leave your maiden aunt, your kids and your critical faculties at home, come for a laugh and you'll have a blast.
