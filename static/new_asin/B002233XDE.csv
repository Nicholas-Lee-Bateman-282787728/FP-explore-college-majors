3841565,5,B002233XDE,My 10 month old loves this movie she watchs it everyday.  If your child likes the wiggles then they will love this video.,1250208000,,121,4.260869565217392
3841566,5,B002233XDE,"My boys love this new Wiggles DVD!  My oldest son has been a fan of the Wiggles for years, and we thought he was too old for the group now, but he has watched this DVD at least 20 times since we got it last month.  He will stop what he is doing when his favorite song on this DVD comes on.  The boys love the backgrounds and love the songs.  The music is catchy and this is definitely a winner by the Wiggles.",1249862400,,409,3.8333333333333335
3841567,1,B002233XDE,"Wiggle Around the Clock was the first DVD we bought and it is great!  Lots of up beat, energetic, catchy tunes.  The songs make all of us want to dance and put big smile on all of our faces.  We went to buy more, since this is the greatest thing to our little boy, and purchased Wiggle Time and the new, Bananas one.  Wiggle time is boring and slow and only the live songs at the end make it watchable.  It couldn't even keep my son's attention for a minute where the first one makes him go into a zone and he won't take his eyes off the TV.  The new Wiggles go Bananas is computer generated and the songs are worthy of one star.  We went through every song on both of the DVDs and agreed that our son will probably never watch either again.  Waste of money!",1249776000,5,758,4.040268456375839
3841568,5,B002233XDE,"My 2 year old daughter LOVES The Wiggles, and she LOVES this DVD. The best part is that in the bonus selections they have included 2 of the Wiggle and Learn episodes that were previously aired on the Disney Channel. This DVD is definitely worth the money. We love it and I even find myself siging along to the catchy tunes. Buy it, you won't be dissappointed!",1249603200,,359,4.373134328358209
3841569,5,B002233XDE,"This DVD was worth the $$.  My 3-1/2 yr old daughter LOVES The Wiggles, and has to watch this disc every night before she goes to bed.  The music/songs are absolutely fantastic, and she especially likes the pink Wiggle.  We definitely have gotten our money's worth out of it already.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a child that is obsessed with Sam, Anthony, Jeff, Murray, or Captain Feathersword.",1249516800,,407,4.690140845070423
3841570,5,B002233XDE,"This DVD takes a small bit of getting used to since it is entirely about animals but like the other Wiggles DVDs, it becomes addictive. My 3 year old requests it over and over! The use of real animals paired with some real catchy song lyrics are a real hit in my house. I do wish they would pull back from using some of the computer-generated scenery because it is so redundant ...but the kids probably don't care. If you have a Wiggles fan at home, buy this one for sure.",1248912000,,472,4.197802197802198
3841571,5,B002233XDE,"I am giving 5 stars because it's that good to me. My 3 year old son loves the dvd and I have to say I enjoyed it as well. An added bonus to me was, getting to see all the ""real"" animals. The wiggles are dressed as animals and that is cute and makes the kids laugh, but it also has lots of live animals. And of course all kids love animals. If you are a wiggles fan or if your little one loves animals you can't go wrong with this one. It's full of toe tapping songs, and lots of wiggle fun. I will have to say I missed seeing Benny in this dvd. I guess he has left the wiggles. Captain feathersword hasn't went anywhere:) He's still a ball of fun for the kids. The captain and Anthony is our favorites. Get the dvd, your kids will love it!",1248480000,4,739,3.9006622516556293
3841572,4,B002233XDE,"My 2yr old loves this DVD...but he's always enjoyed The Wiggles.  I can take repeated viewings of every other Wiggles DVD we own (as my son will want to watch a DVD several times in a row), but for some reason, this one grates my nerves after only two viewings.  Maybe it has to do with there being too many monkeys...who knows.  How many times can you stand hearing a crazed monkey going ""oh-oh, ah-ah, eek-eek"" in Capt Feathersword's crazy voice?

But really, you can't go wrong with the Wiggles.",1248048000,3,498,4.5
3841573,4,B002233XDE,My kids love the Wiggles and this is one of the best.  It was very cute and we are so unhappy that they stopped touring.,1360627200,,120,3.8
3841574,5,B002233XDE,My kids loved this Wiggles movie! Right along in line with the rest of their movies! I am sure we will end up buying after renting!,1360195200,,131,4.076923076923077
3841575,5,B002233XDE,"My  grandaughter loves this she doesn't stop dancing and singing. This video holds her intrest the whole ti'me it's on. The  wiggles not only teach her new songs, but also teaches her new dances I also have two nephews that love this video when they come over they want  to watch it .I would definately reccomend this video for anyone who has small children",1355529600,,357,4.546875
3841576,5,B002233XDE,"My son, who's one-year old, loves this video. The songs are fun and catchy and he loves looking at the animals. He dances at the coffee table as he watches. I'm not sure what it is about these guys but he loves them. I highly recommend this video. That said, I like the video because it allows me some time to tidy up the house and make dinner:)",1353974400,,345,4.088235294117647
3841577,4,B002233XDE,"My almost 3 year old son loves this video.  Asks to watch it everyday, now he knows the words to the songs and dances along with Wiggles and Captain Feathersword :)",1351900800,,164,4.290322580645161
3841578,5,B002233XDE,Great for my grandson.  He loves Monkey Man and I am a scary tiger the best.  My granddaughter loves Wag the dog.  Great for young children.,1344211200,,140,4.3076923076923075
3841579,5,B002233XDE,The DVD arrived on a timely basis.  The condition of the DVD and it's case was excellent.  My 2 year old son was so happy to finally own his favorite DVD.  Go Bananas is not the best Wiggles DVD to me but all the songs are fun.,1342569600,,227,3.7872340425531914
3841580,4,B002233XDE,"My three-year-old daughter loves this movie. I feel like we've watched it about 50 times since I purchased it, which was less than a month ago. Most of the songs are catchy, as is typical for the Wiggles. My daughter likes to get up and dance with the Wiggles on some of the songs. She particularly likes the song ""The Monkey, the Bird, and the Bear"" because it features animal sounds and movements. Currently, this is my daughter's favorite Wiggles movie. It's the one she requests most often.

I like Sam's rich voice. He makes most of the songs easy on the parent's ears. I have to admit, I prefer LISTENING to this movie over watching it. I don't know what happened to the Wiggles over the years, but I think at some point they stopped being educators and instead became entertainers. Part of the Wiggles' charm has always been the way they interact with children, but they don't even have children on their movies anymore. That fact is very disappointing.

One more thing I should mention is that the song ""Tassie Devil"" is particularly annoying. It's the Wiggles' attempt at a rock song, I guess, but it's really just repetitive noise 'sung' by Captain Feathersord in his nerve-wracking, fake voice. You can look up the MP3 album on Amazon here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go-Bananas/dp/B003UJNHEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go Bananas!</a>&nbsp;and listen to all of the songs from the movie.",1337212800,,1446,5.1752136752136755
3841581,2,B002233XDE,"Most of the music on this DVD is uninspired and forgettable; my children absolutley love the Wiggles but walk away from the television shortly after the first song ""Monkey Man"", which is probably the only song that isn't a throw-away on this whole disc (aside from some of the bonus content, which can be found on other, better DVDs). Come to think of it, the only reason you might want to purchase this DVD is to make it easier to peel your children away from the TV after watching one of the better Wiggles DVDs.",1320364800,,514,4.421052631578948
3841582,1,B002233XDE,"My 2 yr old loves the Wiggles but for some reason does not like this video.
Songs are lame too...",1317686400,,97,3.9
3841583,5,B002233XDE,This is the best of the modern (post Greg) Wiggles.  The songs are creative and catchy.  The kids love all the animals.  My daughter gets up to dance to almost the entire video. Well worth the purchase.,1313798400,,202,4.405405405405405
3841584,5,B002233XDE,"I personally find Wiggles Go Bananas to be kind of creepy!  They are dressed up as animals in many of the songs and the back rounds are surreal and they have little jazz clips... it's all just a bit odd to me.  So, as mom, this is probably my LEAST favorite Wiggles movie.  I love the Wiggles, and I'm more partial to Greg, but I'm warming up to Sam.  However, my rating isn't about what I think of the movie, it's what the kids think, and they were who it was intended for.  This particular movie is a pretty big hit for all of my kids ages 2, 5 and 6.  The 5 and 6 year old aren't as into the Wiggles as they were 2-3 years ago, but this movie did catch their attention and they like it.",1300924800,2,689,3.920863309352518
3841585,5,B002233XDE,"My daughter is a huge Wiggles fan. We love this DVD.  She still loves the older DVD's better than the new computer generated ones, but this is a very fun DVD with very fun and catchy songs.",1296518400,,189,4.108108108108108
3841586,5,B002233XDE,"My 8 month old has had some health issue which have made him a very high needs baby, sometimes crying for 8 hours a day. When he was 4 months old we discovered that he *loves* the Wiggles. Needless to say this was a God-send. The Wiggles have sometimes been the only thing that would calm my son down and have helped us keep our sanity. We discovered that not all Wiggles DVD's are equal, this along with You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, are the two he will watch endlessly. He loses interest in others we have tried, but this one is really fun and has a lot of variety. His favorite songs are Monkey Man, Tazzy Devil, and Jazz Cats and favorite characters are Anthony, Sam, and Captain Feathersword (the sillier he is the more my son smiles). Some commentators said they didn't like the computer background on this and YMMFLD but I think my son likes it better than the live or set DVD's because it's brighter and more varied. Definitely one of the best Wiggles DVD's!!",1294617600,,968,4.383333333333334
3841587,2,B002233XDE,We love the wiggles. But this one is a disappointment. It's like they knew it was bad and brought Kylie to make it exciting. It's so boring and uninteresting to toddlers. I would have hated it if it was made by others. We are trying to like it just for the wiggles. My best one ever is definetly pop go the wiggles. There are better DVDs for them. Don't waste your money.,1290729600,,371,4.166666666666667
3841588,5,B002233XDE,My daughter (19 months) loves this movie. She gets up and dances and makes all the animal sounds. It is her favorite video by far. As a parent this is the only video of her's that doesn't drive me...bananas!,1287273600,,207,4.333333333333333
3841589,5,B002233XDE,The songs on this DVD are great. Very catchy tunes and very visually interesting. This is my favorite of all the many Wiggles DVDs we have. Get it!,1285200000,,147,4.285714285714286
3841590,2,B002233XDE,"The Wiggles are by far the most entertaining kids act in circulation today.  Forget Barney, In The Night Garden, and the others - the Wiggles entertain both kids and parents.  Unfortunately, this DVD is a letdown.  Aside from the brilliant Monkey Man with Kylie Minogue, the rest of the DVD is just not as entertaining as the other DVDs.  It's not as lively, and the songs aren't as well known, so my son loses interest fairly quickly.  I'd recommend skipping this DVD and going with some of their more recent DVDs (I'd recommend the Sam ones over Greg, but that is just a personal preference).",1272931200,,594,4.619047619047619
3841591,5,B002233XDE,"I have two kids, one is 5 and the other one is 2 years old. They just LOVE IT. The music is great and with this video they are staring to like Sam ( I like him but for my kids was difficult because they love Greg - we all still do ). They love the animals they show and they can watch it again and again and again. Well done Wiggles.",1269129600,,333,3.638888888888889
3841592,5,B002233XDE,My almost 2 year old loves anything Wiggles and this DVD is no exception.  Keeps him interested and excited.,1262822400,,108,4.684210526315789
3841593,5,B002233XDE,"It's just a really good idea to have a Wiggles movie on your hard drive for emergencies.  The perfect video for children the right age to shred important documents or wander back into the surgical suite if you have to stop by the office for a few minutes. And since my children have always done the dances and songs along with them, its good exercise.
(If your children don't do this, you should model the behavior for them :P  Please post a video review if you do.)",1259107200,,466,4.344827586206897

3841595,5,B002233XDE,"My grandson, who is 21 months old, just loves this DVD.  He wants it on all the time!  He dances and sings along and makes the sounds of the animals the Wiggles are representing.  Also, he is learning about different animals, from the barnyard ones to those that live in distant countries, like Australia.",1257638400,,305,4.611111111111111
3841596,5,B002233XDE,"The Wiggles are new to my 2 yr old granddaughter.  Now she can't get enough of them.
Every day she asks me to turn on the Wiggles.
 She loves dancing to most of the songs, especially the monkey dance.  We also enjoy watching the live animals
that they show before some songs.  Since the Wiggles are new to us, I am enjoying watching and
hearing the tunes and love to listen to especially Sam & Anthony.  They are all very important
to the group, and the group wouldn't be the same if one was missing. I highly recommend this
DVD to any one that has a child the loves music.  I also think that parents & grandparents might
enjoy these as well. It's good to have something that everyone can enjoy.",1255996800,,695,4.267175572519084
3841597,4,B002233XDE,"The first time we watched this DVD, my daughter was a bit overwhelmed. The first song is with a guest singer and The Wiggles are all dressed up so she couldn't quite pick out who they were. Now that we have seen it several more times, she actually dances to it. She even has a few favorites already. We are fans of the ""new"" Wiggles and like the costumes and computer backgrounds. These are mostly original songs so unlike the nursery rhyme DVDs these songs are a little sillier.",1255910400,,479,4.393258426966292
3841598,5,B002233XDE,I purchased this for my grand daughter's birthday (November).  I'm sure it will be great.  We saw this show on stage and loved it.  We have several other Wiggles DVDs and love them!,1254700800,,181,4.424242424242424
3841599,5,B002233XDE,"Although we miss Greg, Sam is excellent in The Wiggles Go Bananas.  This DVD is packed with catchy tunes and the videos are excellent.  The Wiggles are different but in a very good way!  The guys wear different outfits (in addition to their skivvies) which is fun to watch.  Sam has an amazing vocal range and the songs will appeal to adults as well as children.",1254009600,,362,4.4393939393939394
3841600,5,B002233XDE,"I bought this as a surprise happy for my 2 year old grand-daughter, and she loved it. So did her 3 year old brother. They sing every song with the Wiggles. Very good purchase.",1252713600,,175,4.176470588235294
3841601,5,B002233XDE,"I have 4 more wiggles dvd including this one. Actually, I miss the oldies which were relatively simple and very easy to sing and dance along. I was little bit disappinted at the recent 'You make me feel like dancing' dvd. However, this is quite different from that. 'Go bananas' knows real fun!!!!
My 25-month-old daughter really looooves all the songs in this dvd. expecially, 'monkey man', 'monkeys in a tree', 'holidays(can't remember exact title)'..and 'chicken walks'!
all the songs are new ones and very catchy.
I highly recommend this dvd for you and your young ones.",1251936000,,574,4.927835051546392
3841602,5,B002233XDE,"This is probably going to end up as one of my kids' favorite of the Wiggles dvds.  This and the Wiggly Safari with Steve Irwin.  My daughter (almost 4 yrs old) and my son (age 2) both love the animals and the songs were energetic and fun.  And I find that I end up singing along as well.  We got this when it first came out and we have probably seen it at least twice a week (sometimes 4 or 5 times a week) since then.  I like most of the songs and my kids love jumping around to the music and dancing.  I liked the bonus features as well.  Like one of the other reviewers, I too missed Ben Murray on this dvd.  He has been such a staple on all of the other dvds that we have that is was a bit of a shock and a disappointment not to see him on this one.  I hope he has not left the Wiggles and is just taking a break.  I would definitely recommend this dvd.",1251072000,,857,3.790960451977401

8349583,5,B002233XDE,"This is a very whimsical Wiggles DVD which brings back some of the charm of the original ones. Our family misses a lot of the unique creativity that went into the first Wiggles performances without all the special effects! We can remember when the crew drove a cardboard cut-out car!!! This DVD is a sweet blend of the old and new. It has a minimal amount of computerized graphics with the fabulous engaging humor, interesting choreography, funny props and upbeat Wiggly music that we have grown to love over the years.
While most viewers are little ones, I have two Tweens with special needs, so our family has been Wiggling for a very long time! This DVD truly engages my lower functioning son but also keeps all of us jumping, dancing and joyful. The songs are very happy and upbeat. I believe that this will make young and older ""go bananas"", get exercise and recharge energy. If I may say so... It has quite an ""a-peel""!!!
