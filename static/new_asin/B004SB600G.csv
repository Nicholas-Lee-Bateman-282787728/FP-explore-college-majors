4462230,3,B004SB600G,"This is a slap in the face to collectors of classic cartoons and I am 100% unimpressed, but at least they show uncut versions of the cartoons which are magnificently restored and they have Remicks which is an effort to bring DTV back to life. However, I still frown upon the fact that they have edited versions of the cartoons and BLAM which is so annoying to the extent that you want to find the ""High school dropout"" (as some other reviews labeled him) and strangle him, this is destroying classic entertainment!!",1311379200,2,515,4.608695652173913
4462231,1,B004SB600G,"If you are thinking of purchasing this DVD in hopes of some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons? Then will you be disappointed. These are essentially three types of ""remixes"":

- ""BLAM!"" This is just clips of the classic cartoons with cheesy 90's type narrations and an obnoxious high school dropout shouting the word ""BLAM!!!"" every time Donald Duck is hit on the head with something or another. Search ""Disney Blam"" on YouTube to experience this travesty for yourself.

- ""Re-Micks"" These are Mickey Mouse shorts mixed up to modern music. (Hannah Montana, Jonas Brothers). Great toons, terrible songs.

- ""Short Versions"" These are just the shorts cut down and re dubbed to about three minutes long instead of 8. The interesting thing about these is that we get to hear Brett Iwane as Mickey, as Wayne Allwine passed away last year.

In conclusion DO NOT BUY. Go for the Walt Disney Treasures sets instead. These have the cartoons uncut and with a great deal of extras.",1311120000,11,965,4.83030303030303
4462232,5,B004SB600G,Buy this if you are buying for your kids and not trying to relive your childhood. They offer short and long versions of each cartoon and they are all exceptional my daughter watches them over and over. If you are looking for a good cartoon set for young children without the violence and crap of todays this is the choice for you.,1310428800,,330,4.338709677419355
4462233,2,B004SB600G,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict--Disney has taken a handful of vintage animated shorts, shortened them to ""speed up the pace,"" rescored them with faux-Carl Stalling garbage, and added some incredibly obnoxious ""Blam!"" and ""Re-Micks!"" shorts into the mix to turn this offensive headache of a release into a full-blown migraine.

The disc also contains full-length, beautifully restored versions of the same animated shorts. That's the meat of the disc.

When you press ""play all,"" you're shown the restored version and then the shortened version back-to-back, which makes for an obnoxiously repetitive viewing experience kids will grow frustrated with. To get the most out of the disc, you're going to have to select each individual short from the disc menu.

 I have to admit that these shorts do look great. They're beautifully restored, free of scratches and flecks, boasting vibrant colors and magnificent detail. The audio is strong too, both on the older 2.0 mixes and the newer 5.1 mixes on the shorted versions.

4462235,4,B004SB600G,"Have a Laugh was Disney Channel's answer to Cartoon Network bringing back the classic Looney Tunes shorts for a short time in 2009, but those continue to be seen on Boomerang today in 2015, as totally lackluster as it's gotten since last Christmas. Too bad the Disney shorts can only be seen as musical mashups on Disney Junior these days. With Have A Laugh on DVD, you get 5 uncut shorts, edited versions of all 5 of them, 3 whacko BLAM shorties based on the total ""ridonkulousness"" of real life sports on TV today, and 1 Re-Micks music video; based on certain stars' songs, and shorts set to them in unique ways, similarly to DTV's specials and music videos! It's a wonder the Have A Laugh DVD set never went past volume 4, but stay ""tooned"" for my review on it, if you'll pardon the pun!",1450137600,2,790,4.417808219178082

4462242,5,B004SB600G,My 4 year old grand daughter laughs uncontrollably when she watches the silly antics in these classic Disney cartoons.  It's so much fun to laugh along with her!,1359590400,,161,4.75
4462243,2,B004SB600G,"For the record, here are the complete cartoons on this short set:
""Mickey's Delayed Date,""
""The Whalers,""
""Chef Donald,""
""How to Play Baseball"" and
""Pluto and the Gopher.""

And these are the only reason to buy this set IF you have not bought the Disney Treasures DVDs.  Those are the better buy for your money.

Do kids who watch 2 1/2 hour movies like Harry Potter & Avatar really need these 6 minute cartoons cut down to 3 minutes? Somebody at Disney Marketing thinks so & they hope you will think so also and buy these again.  Their thought is that you get the complete version for the adult fan and the cut-down version for the kids.",1312848000,7,637,4.418803418803419
