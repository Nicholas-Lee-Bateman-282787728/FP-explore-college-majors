458350,4,6302375711,"This is my favorite one of the four Pippi movies filmed in Sweden. There have been other Pippi adaptations, but nobody does it like Inger Nilsson! In Pippi On The Run, Pippi and her friends Tommy and Annika are a little older and seem more comfortable in their roles. The English dubbing over the children's voices sounds a little Brooklynese, and it's funny. But it doesn't distract from the dialogue or story, which is basically this: Tommy and Annika are fed up with their parents' nagging, however well intended, and long for Pippi's carefree lifestyle. They decide to run away from home, and Pippi alleviates their parents' concerns by agreeing to go with them. Pippi's one condition is that they won't bring any gold coins because running away is more fun with minimal planning. Along the way they get separated from Pippi's horse, and they meet an eccentric glue peddler and a cantankerous farmer with five little boys. Pippi goes down a waterfall in a barrel, takes on an ornery bull in a field, and powers up a junked convertible as only Pippi Longstocking can! The kids also hitch a scenic train ride, earn money, and run into a humorous problem with a cow. Of course Tommy and Annika begin to appreciate the comforts of home and even some of the boundaries their parents have set! But they have plenty of fun along the way.",1272672000,11,1334,4.680851063829787

I wanted to get the same original ones I watched for my kids, and based on some of the reviews about how terrible the dubbing was I was scared it wasn't the same, but it is! And little annikas voice is the exact same! The review comparing it to an old smoker from the Bronx was kinda funny, but to me, that is the annika I knew as a kid watching these great shows! My kids love this and think pippi is as awesome as I did!",1469664000,4,476,3.8181818181818183
