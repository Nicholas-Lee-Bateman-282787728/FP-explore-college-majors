7797286,1,1571206213,Worthless.  Not involved enough for any onE who does not know paper piecing her way.  Really sad.  I do paper piecing and this dvd dies nothing at all to help me.  A water of my money.  To think I purchased the dvd and book.  So sad.,1475020800,,233,3.9565217391304346

I also puchased her CD, which also teaches you to chain piece the paper piecing to several designs! I am so thrilled I got this book and the CD!!",1362009600,2,223,4.463414634146342

Wonderful Teacher.",1348358400,,114,4.476190476190476
7797290,4,1571206213,"I hadn't bought an instructional dvd before, so this was a pleasant surprise. I have quilted for years, but never done paper piecing. I wish this had had more than 2 templates, though.",1347408000,3,184,4.606060606060606
7797291,5,1571206213,"Let's face it, most paper piecing patterns are full of angles that make guessing impossible, so trial and error or checking and rechecking or ripping out and starting over are a part of the process. This turned me off in the past. Peggy's patterns are clearly marked and using her strip-piecing method together with them eliminates the guess work and elimiates steps making it a faster process. Some checking is required, but no more than on regular piecing as the 1/4 inch seam allowance still applies. Peggy covered every single question I thought and repeated her answers when the situation arised during the instructional part of the DVD. Two patterns she demonstrates are included (as downloads) with the DVD.",1228867200,12,714,5.008403361344538
