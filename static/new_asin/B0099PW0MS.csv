5295017,5,B0099PW0MS,I really love these DVD's (I own all of them) for keeping my body and body in check.,1418256000,,84,3.7222222222222223
5295018,3,B0099PW0MS,"not as good as expected, to lengthy with pre posture lectures.",1413590400,2,62,4.7272727272727275
5295019,5,B0099PW0MS,This is just what I was looking for. It showed up on time and in great condition. :) thanks.,1405900800,,92,3.8947368421052633
5295020,3,B0099PW0MS,"Too much talking, no much fun to practice.
It will be nice if the program only the actions we should following.
It will be great if it has nice and relaxing background music.",1396310400,4,174,4.303030303030303
5295021,4,B0099PW0MS,"Great for anyone. Vini yoga is very versatile and Gary is a world class teacher. Very awesome, I highly recommend.",1391472000,,114,4.75
5295022,5,B0099PW0MS,"He starts with an excellent detailed explanation about the causes of both anxiety and depression. I didn't realize that I had so many chronic symptoms of anxiety until I watched his lecture. I thought that my various symptoms were unrelated (IBD, chronic neck pain, hormonal imbalances etc). This understanding that my issues stemmed from anxiety helped me greatly as it led me to Psych K therapy (he does not suggest that, I found it on my own). I found the sessions deeply relaxing and they brought real energy shift to me. Really recommend these and suggest that you watch the lectures to start.",1368921600,19,598,4.815533980582524
5295023,3,B0099PW0MS,"I bought these based on my experience with the Viniyoga back care series.

Unlike that series, these sessions are LONG and not practical for my schedule.",1368057600,8,153,4.884615384615385
5295024,5,B0099PW0MS,I recommend this dvd to anyone who does yoga. It is easy to follow and focus on. It is excellent for anyone to do whether or not one suffers from anxiety or depression. Gary Kraftsow's voice is easy to listen to and he is very informative. I am very happy to have discovered all of his dvds. Thank you.,1363046400,8,302,4.135593220338983
5295025,5,B0099PW0MS,"The anxiety practices are nice to do before bed. The depression practices give you energy, might make you wakeful--best to do earlier in the day. The chanting practice for anxiety is interesting. The more physical practice for depression is the strongest. My guess is these would be useful to many people, whether or not depressed or anxious.

As other reviewers have noted, there is no music. But Gary's voice is soothing and helpful, particularly if you use the mp3 versions of these practices. The mp3s can be useful if you're traveling or have a need to listen to the practice using earbuds (maybe you don't want to disturb your roommate).",1359849600,17,643,4.845454545454546

8538092,2,B0099PW0MS,"A big disappointment. I typically like Gary Kraftsow's work, but this was nothing as I expected. I have found more thoughtful guided practices for anxiety and depression online for free.",1492300800,,186,5.233333333333333
8538093,5,B0099PW0MS,Amazing presentation and explanation. Helps me feel good after every practice.,1473638400,,78,6.181818181818182
8538094,5,B0099PW0MS,"Lectures on these videos are worth the cost alone (and the cost isn't really that much when you look at it). Gary Kraftsow has so much insight on Yoga, the breathing and how it connects to the parasympathetic nervous system, etc. I would have bought these for the lectures alone. I completed one of the anxiety practices and I have never really done yoga before. I was able to do the complete 45 minute practice. Thank you Viniyoga Institute!",1460937600,,442,4.6075949367088604
8538095,5,B0099PW0MS,"I use Gary's sequence with my seniors and they love it.  This has helped several of them to get stronger, while gently moving their.  I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a gentle and effective way to help them through periods of Anxiety and/or Depression.",1451520000,3,272,4.645833333333333
8538096,1,B0099PW0MS,"These would not play in any of our DVD players: iMac, regular DVD player, Wii, etc.  Disappointing!",1444435200,,99,4.823529411764706
8538097,5,B0099PW0MS,"These DVDs are amazing. Very informative and Gary obviously knows his stuff. I did the anxiety one yesterday and experienced peace and mental QUIET for the first time in a long time. Love the pranayama section.
Wonderful DVDs. Buy them.",1435968000,3,236,4.925
8538098,5,B0099PW0MS,"As a 60+ yoga instructor I ONLY recommend these DVD's to those who inquire.  Gary is an amazing instructor providing all you need to tend to a personal yoga practice.  His work is backed by his experience, education, and the National Institute of Health.  With his DVD's you need not attend any public classes if you are serious about building your own/or upon your personal practice.  I attended one of his workshops and it resonated with my teaching style; which is, being with your student at their personal level of experience and fitness as well as being very therapeutic.  You can trust, enjoy, and appreciate the educated scope of effort put forth in all of Mr. Kraftsow's DVD's.",1429401600,8,686,4.779661016949152
8538099,5,B0099PW0MS,Very useful 2 DVDs to have together whether for a practitioner or non- practitioner.,1428019200,,84,5.071428571428571
8538100,4,B0099PW0MS,I'm enjoying the sessions.,1421884800,,26,5.75
