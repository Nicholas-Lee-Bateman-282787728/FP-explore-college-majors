4287581,5,B004963WTM,"Monkey Monkey Music with Meredth Levande - the Videos was a entertaining way to spend 36 minutes with my kids! The music is fun and interesting, and little bit different than what you normally hear for kids music. Some tracks were really upbeat and fun to dance and move to, while others were relaxing and you just wanted to close your eyes and listen.

This DVD has been watched MANY times in my home, and by now my kids know all the words. This is a favorite in our home, and has been enjoyed by not only my kids, but my husband, myself, and the many friends that have watched it while over to play.",1319414400,,601,4.226086956521739
4287582,5,B004963WTM,Meredith's Monkey Monkey Music videos are great for kids.  The songs are easy to learn and sing along and the videos are fun and keep kids' attention.  Meredith's voice is quite appealing and children will gravitate to her wonderful energy.  Highly recommended for young kids!,1296777600,,276,5.088888888888889
4287583,5,B004963WTM,I have two children one is 7 and the other is 3 1/2.  We have been lucky enough to be listening to Meredith's music for three years and both kids still LOVE her music!  My 7 year old says Meredith's music makes her happy and she loves to rock out to it.  My son begs for Monkey Monkey Music and dances from the first to the last song!  As an adult her music never gets old and I love that when my children are not getting along I can bring out Meredith and they both settle down!,1361145600,,479,3.9072164948453607
4287584,5,B004963WTM,"As a father of two children who have been growing up on Meredith's music, and as a licensed music teacher/music therapist in NYC, I am not exaggerating when I state that Monkey Monkey Music is following a proud tradition of intelligent children's music set forth by composers like Joe Raposo of Sesame Street and Bob Dorough of Schoolhouse Rock.  Her songs are fun, thought provoking, and are fun for adults to listen to with their young children over and over again.",1361145600,,467,4.765432098765432
4287585,5,B004963WTM,Ordered this after seeing Meredith on PBS.  My 18 month old twin boys prefer to watch real people and kids singing and dancing over cartoon and muppet musical videos so this is a great find.  The songs aren't annoying for adults even after having to watch it over and over.  We rotate this dvd with SteveSongs.,1349222400,2,310,4.5
4287586,5,B004963WTM,"Oh, do we love music over here! When I was first introduced to the DVD, I clicked on some of the teaser links. My daughter was asking if we could watch it over and over. Just today she put this DVD in again. It is a very fun set full of very entertaining music. My daughter gets up and dances all around. She was singing today, ""Let's go Down, Let's Go Down to China Town!"". If you want to see what she is singing about, watch some previews.  I recommend this DVD...it's a very fun, active one!",1324252800,,494,4.092783505154639
4287587,5,B004963WTM,"The day we got the DVD, we sat down to watch it. In no time, my kids were up and dancing around. Their favorite song by far is Jump High. Meredith's songs were catchy and appealed greatly to my two toddlers.",1320796800,,207,4.073170731707317
4287588,5,B004963WTM,"The videos on this DVD are for songs from the debut album from Meredith LeVande, called Monkey Monkey Music. The DVD runs 36 minutes long, with videos for 15 different songs.  Some videos are animated, some feature kids dancing along, some are live action portrayals of the song. None of the videos or songs were annoying to me as an adult, which is very important, since I suspect we will be watching this DVD many times in the months to come.  I thought the videos were fun, very well-made, and educational without being boring.  And, best of all, unlike many other shows that my kids watch, this is one that gets them off the couch and up and moving!

Disclosure: I received a copy of this DVD to review for myself. I was not compensated in any other way and all opinions posted here are mine and mine alone.",1319500800,,811,4.422818791946309
4287589,5,B004963WTM,"We recently received the Monkey Monkey DVD for review. My kids watched the DVD over and over and over and over and over again, until they had every song completely memorized. My daughter loves to follow the dance moves, too.

Their favorite song, from the DVD, is called Chinatown. This DVD would be enjoyed by children both at home and in a classroom setting. My kids love it!",1319500800,,377,4.544117647058823
4287590,5,B004963WTM,"One especially attractive aspect of Monkey Monkey Music: The Videos, a new DVD of music videos for kids 2 through 8 from Meredith LeVande, is its homemade look and feel. Many of the backgrounds and sets look hand-drawn with washable markers, props are kid projects made from paper plates and brown paper lunch bags, and the children who comprise the ""dance crew"" are real kids--not plasticky professionals, they smile, giggle, and sometimes look self-conscious. Instead of a highly polished big-bucks production, Monkey Monkey Music: The Videos is a playdate.

LeVande's songs cheerfully reinforce a child's sense of self-worth while involving the child in active participation. Some songs, like ""Jump High,"" have the kids off the couch and moving--jumping, twisting, and dancing to the music. Most of the videos were recorded in the studio, but ""Chinatown"" is a fun visit to New York's Chinatown and an exploration of some of the best food in the world (rivaled only by its neighbor, Little Italy). Kids (and adults) love visiting Chinatown, and the reasons are clear in this video.

There are fifteen videos on Monkey Monkey Music: The Videos, beginning with ""Hello"" and ending with (I'll bet you're ahead of me on this one) ""Goodbye."" Although not overproduced, there are clever animations and effects, including a couple of videos that feature a cartoonized Meredith LeVande (the cartoon is as adorable as the real LeVande).

Monkey Monkey Music: The Videos is a positive force that encourages children to feel good about themselves and to move. There should be a space for it on the shelves of every home with young children and every preschool classroom. Making the Monkey Monkey experience even more interactive are sing-along subtitles that can be turned on or off.",1319500800,,1773,5.1280276816609
4287591,5,B004963WTM,"Monkey Monkey Music is a children's music program developed by Meredith LeVande, an educator and songwriter who has close to a decade of experience working with preschool aged children. Meredith believes that learning and music should be a fun, joyous, experience for children, which is why her music, CDs and DVDs are so successful.

It strikes a great balance between children's music and adult pop songs. You can tell by listening to the songs that Meredith loves to entertain children. She has a beautiful voice and all of her songs are just -- fun.

When I heard that this DVD was being released, I was pretty excited because my daughter, aged 2 at the time, and I really enjoyed the music from her CD. This DVD features 15 songs from her first album titled Monkey Monkey Music that encourage kids to stand up, get moving and dance around.

Having a music video DVD for kids is such a great idea. I'm sure my daughter enjoys watching someone other than mommy and daddy bouncing around to the beat and this DVD features Meredith and a bunch of kids. Our daughter loves `kid watching' so this is a lot of fun for her.

The music is fun for kids and parents alike and takes the viewer, no matter what their age, on fun adventures filled with new sights, sounds and a lot of dancing.
If you are a fan of Meredith's other music, you will enjoy this DVD.

4287592,5,B004963WTM,"One day, my daughter randomly asked me, ""Mommy, what's a Chinatown?"" I looked at her like, ""Whaaaaaaaaat?"" I explained that we went to Chinatown in Los Angeles when she was about a year old and described the experience. She wasn't quite satisfied. ""Yeah, but what's a Chinatown?""

Ooookay.

A few days ago, I walked into her bedroom as Meredith was chanting a very catchy, ""Let's go down... Let's go down... Let's go down to Chinatown!""

OHHHHH! I GET IT. LOL.

It's so infectious, my daughter can be seen tapping her foot as she follows along. If you haven't yet heard of Meredith LeVande (an Educational Children's Musician, Singer, Guitar Player & Award-Winning Video Producer), you certainly will because Monkey Monkey Music videos will be airing on over 50 public television stations across the country. If you're lucky enough to live in the New York Vicinity, you can watch her perform live at public venues or book her for your child's birthday party. She has a really cute, soothing voice and a gentle persona that your kids are sure to love.

Just visit the Monkey Monkey Music website and watch the videos! This is so much better than Kidz Bop.

8418824,5,B004963WTM,"Fun music and a charming production.  Not Hollywood glitz but real live fun.  I think Meredith LeVande is so cool and kids love to sing and dance to these songs.  My Favorite - ""I Love You"".  Not sure which CD/DVD it's on (I bought both) but it is worth it.  Sometimes we catch her on PBS where they will show one song/video between programs.  When she comes on my grandson will stop whatever he is doing and dance away!",1397520000,2,420,4.253164556962025

It keeps him entertained, and I enjoy it too. Catchy songs, cute graphics and even educational.",1388707200,,258,4.51063829787234
8418826,5,B004963WTM,"In October while babysitting my year old grand daughter I came across Meredith singing between some of the children's TV shows.  This was the only time Isabella paid any attention to the shows.  She even did a little ""dance"" in her high chair to the music.  I couldn't recall the name so I did some research by writing to the TV network and finally found Meredith!  I wrote something on her website and she so graciously wrote me several notes.  I ordered both CD's or DVD's or whatever they are for Isabella for Christmas.  I also just posted about it on my Facebook page.",1387065600,,573,4.461538461538462

8418829,5,B004963WTM,"Meredith Levande's DVD is a winner. Her melodies are catchy and her lyrics engage kids as well as their parents. This DVD is in constant rotation in our house and I don't mind at all. As soon as my two year old daughter wakes up in the morning, she says she wants to ""watch Meredith."" My 4 year old son dances along too. My kids love the songs ""My Eyes"" and ""Jump High."" Move over Elmo. Make room for Meredith Levande.",1361491200,,418,4.172839506172839
