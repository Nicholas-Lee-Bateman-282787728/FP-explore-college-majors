8759590,3,B01EUBF9RS,"For anyone who is buying this to get the Blu-Ray version of On Guard!, ... a word of caution. First, both films come with only three menu items: Play, Chapters, Theatrical Trailer. So, if you're looking for any additional material, it doesn't exist. Also - as their is no Setup feature - the subtitles (in English) are ""fixed"" - meaning that the films can only be watched with the subtitles on, and cannot be removed. Additionally, both films are nominally better in resolution and clarity, but the soundtrack for On Guard! is abysmal. There is a distinctive echo or ""canned"" feeling to the sound which makes it seem as though one is watching the movie in one room, while the sound is playing in another. It's extremely unfortunate that the Cohens didn't take enough interest in these films to appropriately restore and enhance them as part of their release on Blu-Ray. For anyone looking to add these films to their collection... get the DVD instead.",1512086400,,951,4.7696969696969695
