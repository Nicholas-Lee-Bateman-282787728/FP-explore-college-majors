7131492,3,B00WFF83BQ,"Pros: Art Style is nice, Music is great, New Voice Actors do a great job and the setup is fantastic.
Cons: Payoff is weak, Anti-theist message was pointless and against Cyborg 009 Older Series, ridiculous ending that didn't work out in a meaningful way for me personally.
Overall: I'd say  rent it if you're curious, but i only had enjoyment for the first hour with all the hints and espionage. Everything else was a bit disappointing or me personally.",1445644800,,452,4.7215189873417724
7131493,5,B00WFF83BQ,"The amount of extra features including the booklet make this worth the 20$,and the action maked story. The story is Fantastically animated minus some slight studery animation at the early quarter of the moviefor like 5 seconds in the bar scene. You'll enjoy the more mature take on the Cyborgs:)",1444348800,,295,4.92
7131494,5,B00WFF83BQ,Having watched the (I think) second release of the anime when it came out I couldn't help but get this.  This was one heck of a romp bringing back favorite characters with a new look and a new story.  Watched it with a bunch of friends and we all loved it. I'll watch it again and again.  They did a great job with this one.,1443398400,,324,3.953846153846154
7131495,1,B00WFF83BQ,"I felt as if the director was trying too hard to create a really deep and complex plot. In doing this multiple characters were tossed to the side until the last few minutes of the movie, and the ""God"" themes throughout the movie felt shallow. This movie literally reminded me of two kids arguing using the words ""because"" as their answer to every statement. Animation was great, but that's all this movie has going for it.",1442880000,2,422,4.565789473684211
7131496,4,B00WFF83BQ,i like it and how it looks but the ending wasn't much sense,1442275200,,59,3.6153846153846154
7131497,5,B00WFF83BQ,009 Re: Cyborg is amazing. I was not expecting the deep God and Man theme in the plot of this film. This is my pick for best anime film of 2015.,1440892800,,144,3.6774193548387095
7131498,5,B00WFF83BQ,definetly was worth the money I loved the series and rmemeber it defiantly was werid movie and didn't get it at all. but I got to admit to see the cyborgs back in action and awesome animation.,1439337600,,192,4.216216216216216
7131499,5,B00WFF83BQ,Great story and art work. It pick up years later. They came together again to face new threat. I enjoyed this Anime. The series was good but bite out dated. The story was well written and the artwork was good as well.,1438300800,,217,4.190476190476191
7131500,5,B00WFF83BQ,"Fans of Cyborg 009 will love this! It does more than just rely on nostalgia. The story, animation and VA is all top-notch!",1438300800,,122,4.3478260869565215
8713037,3,B00WFF83BQ,The film is ok but it fells more like tv show piolet then a film. Further more the film is overall forgettable with not much for old or new fans of the series.,1515974400,,159,3.8484848484848486

8713041,3,B00WFF83BQ,This is a great anima series from Japan but this movie is just ok. The television series is a little bit better than this.,1469404800,,122,4.125

8713043,5,B00WFF83BQ,Enjoyed the film. There is a makeout scene between two characters that is pointless where instead the money used for that scene could have been used to give a longer ending.,1454112000,,173,4.612903225806452
8713044,2,B00WFF83BQ,"Having been an avid Cyborg 009 fan since I first saw the TV series and read the original Manga series in 1979, I eagerly clicked on this Blu-Ray disc as soon as I found it was out, about a week ago, without bothering to read any of the reviews on Amazon.  Maybe I would have ordered it anyway just to find out, but I found the whole feature to be a disturbing mess.

Cyborg 009 gets the ""Ghost in the Shell"" Treatment

Apparently this anime feature was directed by Kenji Kamiyama, who worked on many of the ""Ghost in the Shell"" anime series about scary government conspiracy, cybertech hacking and dystopian cyberpunk themes.  Ok, I can deal with that, I'm a William Gisbon fan, but what he did with Cyborg 009 was something that made NO sense whatsoever and left me asking for answers at the end of the movie.

Stealing the angel skeleton from the Simpsons' 1997 episode ""Lisa the Skeptic"" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMZydmKDUD8 ) and the terrible plot from Star Trek V's (""Search for God""), the plot about how the members of the elite 00- Cyborg team immediately fall for wanting to destroy all civilization upon site of seeing the angel skeleton made no sense at all.  Right down to Joe (009's) plot to blow up Roppongi Hills or other members of the team falling for same.

I can get the Tower of Babel references as far as building towers to the sky, but without a decent explanation of What The Hell Is Going On the plot falls apart quickly.  I can also get the whole fear of US Government conspiracy and NSA spying, but having them taken over by ""His Voice"" simply made no sense at all.  Even though I find it disturbing, I can even deal with the ""Lazarus"" undead cyborgs.

I watched the movie intently with the expectation that I would be rewarded with some sort of explanation at the end-- was Black Ghost or some sort of other nefarious force behind the mind-control bent on destroying all of modern civilization.  Instead we slip into a dreamlike afterlife world in Venice where everybody walks on water and somehow the Cyborg 00 team is reunited with Dr. Gilmore in a world that ""His Voice"" would have wanted.

WTF?  No explanations at all.  No saying what the hell happened after entire cities are bombed and even nuked in a scared post-9/11 world.

This wasn't what Cyborg 009 was about.  I'm quite sure if Shotaro Ishinomori was alive today, he would have hated this film and tried to destroy every copy.  The whole plot was riddled with holes, and left me asking ""where's the rest of the movie where they say what the hell is going on?""

After watching this I want to buy a plane ticket to Japan so I can grab Kenji Kamiyama by his lapels and ask him what the hell he was thinking.
The animation was impressive and even spectacular in some points, but the storyline was incredibly poor and fell prey to the dystopian ethos of the heroes being just as messed up as any bad guys (had we actually encountered any).",1452297600,9,2933,4.5227272727272725
8713045,2,B00WFF83BQ,"""His Voice""?  This movie is desperate for a story line.  Don't recomend it.",1448064000,,75,4.6923076923076925
8713046,5,B00WFF83BQ,"A truly spectacular and deep film. The animation by Production I.G. was outstanding and blended the world of 2D and 3D together perfectly for a unique look. Fans of Shotaro Ishinomori's classic characters will love seeing the 00 Cyborgs in a modern day light such as this; they were fresh and invigorating while still staying true to the personalities we know. For those who are new to this franchise, the cast is varied and interesting all the same. A group of superhumans given strange and dangerous powers against their will, who hold an equally powerful bond with each other that has lasted for years and years. Their own struggles and personal histories, combined with a striking plotline involving a mysterious terrorist threat made for an incredible experience. The English dub was also FAR more than just well done; as the voice cast also gave appropriate accents of each country the Cyborgs hail from. Erin Fitzgerald as 003 and John White as 007 were particularly stand-out. It also features Michael Sorich (voice of 007 from the 2000 Cyborg series) as 006 in this incarnation. You'll be sucked into this movie very quickly; give it a view and you most certainly will walk away with something to think about.",1447459200,,1218,4.888888888888889
