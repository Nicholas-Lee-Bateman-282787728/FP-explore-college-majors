5463690,5,B00AP88IYC,As part of the research and development group for this program I was able to once again fit into my pre-baby size jeans. My daughter was not even a year old yet. While doing these workouts I worked full time and also was in school full time. The workouts were short and effective. I looked forward to doing them each day and being challenged. I would recommend this program to anyone!,1355788800,2,384,4.422535211267606
5463691,5,B00AP88IYC,Wonderful program. As part of the r&d group I lost over 10 inches and 7 pounds and dropped 3 pants sizes. The work outs were fun and effective. I love Lindsay's fun personality and sweet encouragement through out the work outs !,1355788800,3,228,4.4523809523809526
5463692,5,B00AP88IYC,"If you are looking for a great workout post-pregnancy / post-having-kids, this is what you want! I've tried Insanity, P90X, Slim in 6, and Jillian Michael's Workouts but I haven't found the motivation or seen the results that I've gotten from Pretty Fierce Weight Loss.  What I appreciate about Lindsay's workouts (this is my second, and I've just purchased Lean Out) is that she is a mom, just like me.  She knows ""the trouble spots"" we moms face and knows how to attack them.  While the program is definitely intense, and if you are not used to working out regularly you will find that it pushes you to your max, your body changes IMMEDIATELY!  In six weeks, I've lost 10 pounds...while not a great big number, my stomach is so much flatter than it was and I've lost multiple inches on my arms, my waist, my hips and my thighs. So rather than continuing to feel bad about myself because I'm not seeing results, I am so much more confident and know that I am making a lifestyle change for my future.  I've got about 15 pounds to go.",1424822400,20,1033,4.444444444444445
5463693,5,B00AP88IYC,"It took me a week to fall in love with this series. I had been doing Bootcamp 2 dvd and I'd been combining 3 of the 10min workouts plus a 5 min core from the bootcamp 2 dvd, each day (with the warmup included it came to 45min workouts). I was really feeling reasonably fit, so I thought I'd tackle the next step up: Pretty Fierce: weight loss. My baby is 7months old and I didn't have abdominal separation. I should also add that I have 6 kids under the age of 11. My first week doing this DVD was not great. My ankles hurt from the high impact nature of the initial schedule of pure cardio workouts. I almost retreated back to my old routine of Bootcamp 2 dvds because I felt that they tackled more in the time frame (I could do core + cardio + toning in under 45 min) but I stuck it out, and then by the time I got to the 3rd week schedule, I had done all the different workouts and I was starting to really like it. The soreness after the Glutes and Hams workout surprised me! I liked all the workouts by the 3rd week and was a believer!!

There is a lot of variety and I look forward to the fact that everyday is a new combo.  The only part that I don't like is when it says to do the outside anaerobic workout- I like to workout indoors so that I can watch my toddler- I want a dvd for that, not a list of squats, jacks, and sprints for outdoors- however they do give you the option of doing Tabata workout or the Plyometrics workout instead- which I have been doing, so it's no big deal.

I like Linsey's style, I've had quite a few dvd's over the years, and she is my favorite- not sure what it is, but I like her personality- just the right amount of positivity and reality.  I like that she is an actual mom of 3 young kids- that lends credibility to her workouts.
I find myself struggling with the core workouts the most- I guess I don't have a ton of strength there, but the core workouts push me to the ""vocal"" stage (gasping and groaning at times!!). I use 5 and 8 lb weights, but I'm contemplating upping them to the next bracket soon (perhaps when I finish this 8 week round I'll start again with 8 and 10lb weights).
I had some trouble initially accessing the website with the workout schedule. It did require emailing her people to get the right link, and several other elements of the sign up process take some time (still haven't gotten a link to the Facebook support group, despite emailing over a week ago).
If you plan to jump straight into this workout as soon as you get the DVD's here is a list of the initial workout schedule (in case you can't access it):
Day 1:  Cardio Plyometrics + Core A (39min)
Day 2: Tabata Cardio (optional finale) (26min)
Day 3: Shredding (optional finale) + core B (37min)
Day 4: Flex schedule: Anaerobic Capacity Outdoor or Tabata
Day 5: Loading + Core C (30 min)
Day 6: Cardio Plyometrics (28 min)
Day 7: Yoga Hybrid (15min)
I have seen great results in the few weeks I've been doing it. I have lost 15 lbs in the last 7 weeks since doing Linsay Brin workouts. I'm down to 135lbs and feeling better than I have in years. I highly recommend this series if you've already tried her bootcamp DVDs and need something a little harder or if you're reasonably fit already.
I will be buying the Pretty Fierce: Lean Out series next.",1423785600,12,3278,4.205087440381558

5463695,5,B00AP88IYC,"I absolutely love this program!! I'm about 1/2 way through the program & I've lost 5 lbs. and all of my clothes are baggy! I am not following the meal plan only because I'm a vegan but I did consume only 1200 calories the first 2 weeks, as per the recommendation in the packet.  I first started with her boot camp DVDs and had little results as far as weight loss but it did build up my endurance to be able to keep up with this program. I can't wait to try the next series ""lean out""!  Keep up the great work Lindsay!",1409961600,3,518,4.019417475728155
5463696,5,B00AP88IYC,"For the first time I finally found a program that finally has helped me tone and lose weight. After having 2 kids so close together, my midsection has seen better days. The meal plan they have you follow really gives you a good jump start and makes you want to keep going. This is a great program for moms that have saggy midsections or extra baby weight that they want to get rid of. It's definitely tailored to a woman body. I highly recommend this, even if you have no weight to lose, it tones your body up very nicely.",1409788800,2,522,4.23
5463697,5,B00AP88IYC,"I thought this was a great program for the cost and it works when you stick with it and follow the meal plan. I suggest downloading the free mif app and it will give you a calendar with your daily workouts. Most workouts are under 30 minutes. After the first five weeks it bumps up to 45 minutes. There is only one day that is 72 minutes, the third to last day of the program, but you can split it up. The first few days are hard but you will see results if you stick with it. I would recommend this to all moms.",1404172800,3,512,3.9326923076923075
5463698,5,B00AP88IYC,"I am a working mom to two little boys. I work in the retail management industry so my schedule, kinda gets hectic. I love the workouts they are short and effective. Lindsay understands how hard it is to juggle kids, household chores, husband, and work. So all the workouts are effective. I love that she also has MIF app you can put on your phone. I can track my progress and have my workout calendar all in one place. I also bought the Pretty Fierce: Lean Out and can't wait to do it after I complete this program.",1404172800,,515,4.26530612244898
5463699,5,B00AP88IYC,"I really enjoyed this workout series! I love the calendar that tells me just what to do. The first couple weeks of pure cardio were the toughest I think. Loading and Shredding were no joke! I am in decent shape and have exercised moderately for years (running, cardio), but this is the first time I did a program. I have an eleven month old that I am still nursing. I did lose a couple pounds while doing this, but I'm not sure if that was the workout or being near the end of nursing (I lost the last few pounds of nursing weight with my first without any special program around the same age-10-12 months). Either way, my core definitely looks better with a lot more definition  and so does my posterior :) My  hubby said I held my own at the beach last week! I've also noticed more arm and shoulder definition.  I'm going to do Lean Out next, but maybe not til fall when it is cooler and I am done nursing. I love how the workouts are pretty short and she keeps things moving so you don't really get bored. There is enough variety that you are changing it up every two weeks (two weeks of cardio, two weeks of cardio and toning, and two weeks of mostly toning).  Also a rest week  at week 5 and and a final push week at the end.",1404172800,,1230,4.151260504201681
5463700,2,B00AP88IYC,"I bought this set to add variety to my fitness routine.  Prior to buying this, I just finished two rounds each of BurstFit and BurstFit Fire.  Before that, I did T25 and TRX training.  I workout 5-6 days per week and am in good shape.  I was really excited about Pretty Fierce, but this program just didn't do it for me.
Disclaimer: I wasn't looking for weight loss, so I can't speak to that.  And, I admit that I was not interested in the 8-week schedule (which would have been nice to see BEFORE purchasing).  But, for the time spent working out, there are other programs that are a much better use of your time.  For example, per the schedule, workouts are between 15-72 minutes.  As a busy, working mom, I don't have 72 minutes to exercise.  I'd rather do BurstFit or something comparable and get a fantastic workout in in less than 30 minutes, all in one chunk, and go on with my day.  None of the workouts were challenging on their own, though when combined they might be, but again, I am not interested in spending an hour working out when I can get better results in less time.  I also didn't like having to disrupt a workout to get from the warmup into the workout (there is no segue) or changing DVDs.  I didn't care for the program and wouldn't recommend it.",1403654400,8,1269,4.353191489361702
5463701,5,B00AP88IYC,"I am a mother of seven (!) and I LOVE THIS PROGRAM!  I was totally at a loss of what to do with myself.  I was 42 pounds overweight and have not been able to stick to an exercise routine EVER.  I decided after baby #7 was born I was going to finally get my body back!  I was introduced to Lindsay's DVDs back in 2004 and have done them off and on over the years  My kids love doing them with me sometimes! I had Diastesis Recti and sometimes even looked pregnant when I wasn't.  Anyway, I emailed Lindsay to tell her of my predicament and recommend a program or SOMETHING to help me and she pointed me to Pretty Fierce Weight Loss.  I had to wait until my baby was 6 months old to start it and am I ever glad that I did! This is the most amazing program EVER!  She sends encouraging emails, helps with diet through videos she sends you and keeps you on track with her app.  I used all the helps and was faithful to the program and lost 11 pounds and am down 7.5 inches total body including 2 inches off my waist alone!! This helped so much with the D.R. that I am even down two jeans sizes!  I just started my second round of this program today and am so excited to keep going.  The workouts are never boring.  I smile at Lindsay everyday and the change in routine helps me stick to it.  Lindsay and her staff even sent personal emails when I would write them and tell them of my progress.  They truly want to see you succeed and I was thankful for the personal touches.  Lindsay is a real wife and mom who has the expertise and science behind her exercise from her studies.  EVERYTHING reliable that I have read about weight loss online agrees with what I am doing through her program.  The daily menus and advice helped so much too.  If you buy this, be sure and do all the online helps and get the app because it really does help add to the achievements!  And don't trust the scale at first because you will tone up so much and therefore gain muscle.  It will change your metabolism. After my week off, in between my two eight weeks, I was still losing but I didn't see the scale move until about week 4 of my first 8 weeks. if you are considering this, do it!  It will be the best money you ever spend on yourself!",1403481600,6,2218,4.099767981438515
5463702,3,B00AP88IYC,"I'm a Beachbody junkie (NOT a Beachbody coach though) and love 21 Day Fix, TurboFire, CharLEAN Extreme and Les Mills Combat. But I couldn't seem to tone up my mid-section, so I was looking for something tailored to moms. After reading a lot of reviews, I chose this one. While I think these workouts are effective (definitely left me sore), I just couldn't get into them. I'm used to warm ups and cooldowns with every workout, pretty good music, high production value, a countdown clock (for the full workout), etc., so I'm spoiled now. I like to look forward to my workouts.

So instead I'm incorporating the core workouts from this program into my Les Mills Combat routine. This seems to be working. To see if you'll like this program, try watching some of her free videos on YouTube! Or download her app on iTunes, I think she includes a free trial of certain videos. That's my two cents.",1400803200,14,891,4.60377358490566
5463703,5,B00AP88IYC,"I can't say enough about how much I LOVE these workouts!  Just as advertised, these workouts can fit into anyone's day and they produce results.  I just completed the 60 day program yesterday and was excited to see that my fitness level had increased by at least 50%!  With a very busy 19 mos old girl running around, I needed that more than anything.",1396828800,3,351,4.453125
5463704,5,B00AP88IYC,I started this weight loss program when my daughter turned 8 months old.  I had about 10 lbs of baby weight that I just could not get off.  This program was great!  I really liked that most days the workouts were right around 30 mins and they were challenging. Some of the things were too hard for me to do at 1st but I just did what I could and by the end I was able to do everything and keep up with Lindsay.  I finished the program this week and I couldn't be happier with the results.  My body is totally different.  I lost 7 lbs. and a total of 18 inches and that's with me still breastfeeding so ate healthy but didn't cut my calories at all.  Make sure you do the measurements.  There were weeks where I didn't loose any weight but I was still loosing inches off of my waist and hips.  I lost a total of 5 inches off my waist and by the 4th week was back into all my pregnancy clothes again.  I liked this program so much that I am now starting her Pretty Fierce Lean Out.,1395360000,16,979,3.9743589743589745
5463705,5,B00AP88IYC,"I am in week 6 of the program and absolutely love it! Lindsay is an awesome ""trainer"", she is fun, cute, easy to listen and follow, and encouraging! I have never felt stronger in my life! The workouts are really tough, but they go by fast and really push your endurance and strength. I love it so much that i went ahead and purchases PF- Lean Out a couple weeks ago to start as soon as I finish another round of PF - weight loss. I love this program, I love Lindsay

The cardio workouts are quick and intense, the strength training are also quick and intense: completely designed for a busy mom! The ladies that Lindsay has doing the exercises with her and inspiring as well! I think Lindsay has done a great job catering to her audience!",1391385600,4,738,4.309352517985611
5463706,5,B00AP88IYC,"I always know how much effort I put into a workout by the ending result.  Every workout kicked my butt and I was drenched in sweat.  It was so GREAT!  While this workout is intense, I really enjoyed the workouts.  The way these workouts are scheduled together, you never get bored of doing the workout.  It is muscle confusion at its finest.  Lindsay is so encouraging during the entire workout which makes you push yourself to the next level.  Shes so positive and explains the exercises very well.  Being a stay at home mom with 2 kids (a one year old and a school aged child), it is hard to find time to work out, however Lindsay has mastered the shorter, intense, 30 minute workout so you have the ability to fit it into your schedule.  I am happy to report, with her help, I have lost inches, which is something that I have been struggling with.  I am happy with the ending results, but still am looking for more and am looking forward to my next workout with Lindsay Brin.",1390003200,3,978,4.3535911602209945
5463707,4,B00AP88IYC,"I'd like to start by saying I'm a big Lindsay Brin fan. I started doing her bootcamp after having my second child and quickly saw great results.  I ordered the Pretty Fierce app as soon as I heard about it and have seen great results by the end of the 90 days.

However, I did feel the need to write a review as I feel like there were a few things about the series that left me feeling a bit disappointed.

For starters despite talking about how important it is to cool down and stretch many of the the videos do no have a cool down and stretch or one not even a warm up.  I wish there had been a 'cool down' video included that you could use with any of the videos. I work out at 5 am and sometimes after a big cardio session I would just forget to stretch leaving me rather sore the next day.  I use the app on my ipad so I just use a bookmarked Jillian Micheals cool down that I like but if using the dvds at home it might not be an option.

A lot of the toning exercises are a bit awkward to do. At first I felt like I wasn't getting any benefit because I wasn't able to do enough of them.  It wasn't until one of the last dvds that she gave the advise pausing the video and going at your own pace as well as sticking with your heavier weight and pausing to catch up rather than going to a lighter weight that I was really able to do them properly. I think an intro with some key points and advise would have been beneficial.  At the end of the day I do still feel like some of the workouts are too complicated and would be better substituted with a more traditional toning moves.

I would still recommend this video to anyone looking to get into shape after having a baby.  I love the schedule and found the videos easy to get done despite having two bubs under 3. After completing the program I had gone down a couple of sizes and felt and looked great.",1388275200,2,1859,4.0
5463708,5,B00AP88IYC,"I first discovered Lindsay Brin back in January of 2013.  I started working out with her Post-Natal Boot Camp series.  It was working out great -- the program is wonderful.  Unfortunately after week 6, I discovered that my gut seemed to be sticking out more though, which got me worrying about my umbilical hernia, and I was growing horribly tired of people asking me if I was pregnant.

I went to the doctor, and my doctor referred me to a general surgeon due to a hernia that had developed after having my second child nine months previously.  She said it had developed into a rather large ventral hernia.  My general surgeon requested that I meet with a plastic surgeon, and she could fix my hernia while the plastic surgeon could fix my diastasis recti by doing a tummy tuck.  I went ahead and attended the consultation but laughed my head off when she gave me a price quote -- like many people had 6K lying around to spend on altering their bodies.  Even if I did have the money, I assure you that I would have rather paid off my car or invested the money rather than spending it on surgery.  Both of my surgeons told me that I could not fix this through exercise, but I wasn't sure that I was buying that.  Surely there had to be another way to fix my belly.

So, I emailed Lindsay herself, and imagine my shock and surprise that she responded personally.  She began giving me suggestions and she sent me this Pretty Fierce program to just try for the first three weeks...and she wanted to hear how I was doing.  Sure enough, I tried to follow the diet plan and the exercise schedule as much as possible, and I was starting to really see results.  My belly ""hump"" was starting to look more like an avalanche...and I no longer looked pregnant!  Loose skin never bothered me...I just didn't want to look pregnant anymore!  I was relieved, as I thought I was doomed to looking pregnant the rest of my life.

I am currently in week 5, the recovery week.  I have not lost a pound, but I have not gained a pound.  I know that I have gained a ton of muscles -- especially in my upper body -- so, for me, I'm encouraged that my weight has remained consistent.  Muscle weighs more than fat, so to me, I understood this to mean that I'm shedding the fat, but I'm gaining the muscle at the same time.  Perhaps I will have lost a few pounds by the end.  But it wasn't the weight that led me to this program, as I returned to my pre-pregnancy weight before I started the program...it was all the questions from people about when I was due and how much longer I had in my pregnancy.  Absolutely heart-breaking!  I have received comments since -- but they are compliments about how good I look and how much the program is working!

As for the program itself, it is truly enjoyable.  It's challenging, yes...but it's doable.  The workouts are short so they are an excellent option for a full-time working mom like myself.  Lindsay offers a variety of exercises to keep things exciting.  It can be boring doing the same thing over and over again, so this program really kept my interest peaked.  My favorite, by far, is the tabata cardio workout.  It is an easy workout, but as she mentions in the video, it really boosts your endurance.

I visited my general surgeon just last week, and I could not wipe the smile off her face.  She told me that she had many options available to me now to fix my umbilical hernia (the ""ventral hernia"" was just my diastasis recti) -- none of which included a six-week recovery like she had originally anticipated -- but she didn't want to discuss those with me yet.  She told me that whatever I was doing was WORKING.  And she wanted me to continue doing it and wanted to see me in another month.  At the end of our session, she told me with a huge smile, ""I'm so proud of you!""

Thank you, Lindsay, for your program and for caring enough about my situation to email me your personal responses.  I highly recommend it to those needing to repair their diastasis recti and for those who are wanting to lose weight.  We proved the doctors wrong -- diastasis recti CAN be fixed without surgery!!!",1377734400,52,4116,4.401324503311258

I have lost 3 pounds so far (on week 5).  I have not done well following the nutrition part and only ended up doing 3-4 workouts a week, instead of the 6 I was supposed to do.

5463713,2,B00AP88IYC,"I own and love several work out videos by Lindsay Brinn, so I was very excited when this work out was released. I do high intensity work outs at my gym, but it is so hard to get there on a regular basis with my three kids' busy schedules. While my work outs are high intensity, they are low impact. I am forty years old, and years of dance did damage to my knees and my wrists are not the best either.  This workout system is VERY high impact.. I found myself modifying almost every workout to such a dramatic extent that the workout I did didn't even resemble the original work out on the DVD. I had to come up with most of my modifications myself. Some modifications were mentioned, but unlike most work out videos I've purchased in the past, they are not demonstrated, so you just have to figure them out yourself, and hope your form is correct. LOTS of moves on the floor that are burpees and push ups. And even though I run five to six miles several times a week, this workout had so much jumping that I developed shin splints after week three and had to stop. The workout schedule and diet plan are NOT included in the materials.  You have to print them yourself. Also, portions of the workout that are listed on said schedule, are not included on the DVDs.  You have to download them also. The diet plan is just for the first couple of weeks. You are told to go to the MIF website to view a video lesson plan for learning to eat healthy, but you'd better carve out the time to watch the whole thing without too many interruptions because you are only allowed to visit the link five times and then you are locked out. NOT what I would consider friendly for a busy mom's schedule. Overall, I was very disappointed.  I did enjoy the Tabata work out, and the core workouts, but that is such a small portion of the total package that this jut wasn't worth the money I spent.",1366675200,31,1876,4.26123595505618
5463714,5,B00AP88IYC,Nice mix of cardio and strength and enough to not get bored. Great trainer perky without being annoying.  Currently on week 7 and I love it!,1366243200,2,140,4.384615384615385
5463715,5,B00AP88IYC,"Why I Love Lindsay Brin:
Lindsay is a REAL wife and mom.  Unlike a few of the celebrity trainers, she avoids ridiculous or egotistical chit-chat during her videos, and instead gives a positive and encouraging tone to the workout.  Check out her blog, her Facebook posts, everything!  She is super helpful (and sweet!) and has tons of great information available for pregnancy, immediate postpartum, and regular exercise and nutrition (even how to adjust calories if you are nursing).  Her ability to ""cram it all in!"" makes working out feel accessible, even on the busiest of days.

Why This is Lindsay's Best Work Yet:
I have tried a number of Lindsay's DVDs in the past (CFS Method and Bootcamp 2 were my previous favorites), but Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss is even better!  The set design is beautiful (a huge step up from her previous work) and the music is encouraging and energizing, but not overbearing.  The workouts are challenging, but in true Lindsay style, all the exercises are described and demonstrated well so you get maximum benefit.  She is great about correct form.  With the addition of Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss and its sequel Pretty Fierce: Lean Out, Lindsay's work now covers the full spectrum of a woman's childbearing years from newly pregnant to years postpartum, as well as offering something for both the exercise newbie to the advanced exercise enthusiast.

What Equipment You Need:
- Weights - 3s, 5s, and 8s (or no weights if you prefer) for beginners, but more advanced may find themselves needing 15s, 20s, or higher
  Generally you'll need a light set and a heavy set.  The introduction will explain how to know how heavy your weights should be.
- Sliders (can use paper plates) - only used in a few exercises
- Pillow or Towel - use with inner thighs in the Muscle Splits section

More Information:
- The program is 8 weeks long.  Moms into Fitness provides a calendar online that details out which videos to use when.  Try your best to stick to the calendar the first time through because they have carefully planned rest days and such so you work hard and rest well.
- Bonus materials include access to a 6-week nutrition webinar, a digital copy of a workout to try that format, a BMR (basal metabolic rate) calculation and goal weight suggestion
- A few of the videos include optional finales.
- Modification options are given in many cases so you can take it up or down a notch as needed
- You do not need much space.

How This Compares to Insanity, Another ""Extreme"" Workout System

Insanity (from Beachbody) is a fabulous plyometric-focused cardio workout with no weights (only use your body weight, which can be tough!).  While Pretty Fierce does incorporate some plyometric moves, you are not doing them with the same frequency as the Beachbody program because Lindsay notes that too much plyometric work can cause the muscles to bulk.  (Note: I am an Insanity grad and did not have problems with bulking.)  Pretty Fierce also incorporates a variety of cardio and weight training.  The time commitment is similar (60 days, about 40 mins/day to start and more toward 60 min/day later).  Insanity is targeted for both men and women, but PF only features women (although men can, of course, do it too!).

CORE WORK: Lindsay is better at targeting and isolating abs in her core videos, whereas Shaun T (the creator of Insanity) tends to incorporate ab work with larger functional moves.  Both have excellent ab work overall.

FORM: Both Lindsay and Shaun T are really good at exposing common pitfalls to make sure that you are doing the exercise correctly.

CUSTOMIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY: PF is easy to mix and match the sections if you have more or less time or energy on a particular day.  Insanity has less customization unless you do a hybrid program.  If you are using DVDs, Insanity may be preferable to avoid switching DVDs.  Pretty Fierce is available for purchase in digital form but Insanity is not (so far).

COMPREHENSIVITY: Pretty Fierce might be a little more comprehensive because it includes weights and would be a great cross-training option for someone who is doing a lot of running or other exercise and just wants some variety.  Insanity feels a bit more cardio-focused.  Both programs hit all areas of the body though.

VALUE: PF and Insanity are great values overall when compared to the cost of a gym membership, personal training, etc.  PF is offered at a significantly lower price point.  While Moms into Fitness is very accessible via email if you have questions, Beachbody will assign you a ""coach"" to work with one-on-one if you want (Note that if you buy Insanity at full price, $40 goes directly to a coach so the cost of this is built in).

STRETCHING/COOLDOWNS: Not all of Lindsay's DVDs show the suggested cooldown or stretching (sometimes just directions are given), whereas Insanity always includes both a complete warmup and cooldown.

DIFFICULTY: I would recommend that people try Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss before Insanity.  Both are challenging, but Pretty Fierce makes easier modifications more accessible.

Bottom Line:
If you have been doing Lindsay's Bootcamp DVDs, this is a perfect next challenge.  If you are interested in working up to another extreme program like Pretty Fierce: Lean Out or Insanity, this is a great stepping stone.  It is a well-done program and a great value if you are at the correct level for it.  Enjoy!",1363996800,79,7522,4.99437751004016
5463716,5,B00AP88IYC,"This is not like other workouts geared toward mothers!  It's clear that Lindsay knows her stuff.  Although I struggled with some of the aspects at first, particularly ""Shredding"", I'm getting better. The workouts are both challenging and fun.  The different workouts included in the set are versatile, so fitness boredom doesn't set it. I particularly like the length of the workouts, they are not too long, which is important when I don't have a lot of time to fit in a workout.  If you are a mom who wants to get in shape without joining a gym, I recommend using these.",1362614400,2,571,4.623762376237623
5463717,5,B00AP88IYC,This is a serious workout that will give you the results you want. Lindsay Brin did an amazing job designing this program. It's not an easy workout but its meant to be a challenge.,1358812800,3,180,4.323529411764706
5463718,5,B00AP88IYC,"I found Lindsay Brin 3 years ago after I found out I had a condition called diastasis recti.  After 6 c-sections, I had a 3 finger-width separation in my abdominal wall that did not go away with time or traditional abdominal exercises. I started out with Shed 5 Fast and have done most of her workouts since then.  She has researched extensively the area of exercise during pregnancy and knows how to help real moms lose the weight and keep it off after childbirth. All of her videos give modifications for moms with diastasis recti. Her newest series ""Pretty Fierce"" is for women who are several weeks postpartum and cleared for INTENSE exercise.  It includes all the methods that are proven to help us shed the weight and tone up like HiiT, interval training, tabata, weight training... I LOVED the variety and intensity!! I have actually met Lindsay and just have to say she is a real person.  A real mom who has the same struggles as the rest of us.  She is honest and caring which makes it so much easier to push play at 5am.  Thanks Lindsay and Moms into Fitness!!",1358467200,13,1070,4.518134715025907
5463719,5,B00AP88IYC,"I was part of the R&D team for this, it was a great program!  Challenging, but each week I noticed I was stronger and stronger!  This can change the way you workout!  So glad I do not have to go to the gym to get a good burn!  This program is amazing!",1357344000,3,251,3.769230769230769
5463720,5,B00AP88IYC,"I have been working out with Lindsay Brin videos for several years now. My wife and I are huge fans and had the opportunity to be review these workouts and go through them in complete form. We were excited for the chance to do so because we are die-hard fans for a very simple reason: her stuff absolutely works and blows everything else away. Her workouts get results that you can both feel and see. At first, I felt a little sheepish trying these workouts because obviously, they're geared towards women. At the same time, I can't think of a single man I know that wouldn't find these workouts extremely challenging. And I don't say that in a bad way. They are hard-core and designed to kick you in the butt. Nothing else has come close.

Pretty Fierce is meant to jump-start your body right away, and boy does it ever. Lindsay has put together a program intended to ramp up your metabolism, fire up your motivation and melt off the pounds while toning up as well. And most importantly, she does it in a way that you enjoy, never feeling like you're about to do something boring or can't really squeeze into your day. She's funny, inspiring, easy to learn from, and enjoyable throughout. In other words, you'll truly enjoy yourself even though it can be a tough program.

Who is this for? Besides this being fine-tuned for you moms out there looking to get back in shape after a baby, this is for anyone wanting to follow a program that works and gets actual, measurable results. I've tried others (along with my wife) but very quickly returned to Lindsay as she stays up-to-date on the newest research and methods for maximum potential. Prepare yourself for hard work, but you'll be handsomely rewarded for it too.

And if you're looking for a workout partner, this is great to do as a couple as we've been doing now for years. The videos are professionally shot, edited and easy to follow along with. She leaves nothing out for getting the results you deserve, and you can do it all in the comfort of your living room without the stress of a gym.

We're very happy with Pretty Fierce (and absolutely love all her programs, see her ""Lean Out"" program)and I know you will be as well. Once you get started with her workouts, you'll never want to use anything else. And trust me, your friends WILL notice and ask you what you've been doing to look so good. Highly recommended!",1356825600,14,2376,4.531468531468532
5463721,5,B00AP88IYC,"I have been a Lindsay Brin junkie for the past three and a half years, ever since I bought her Shed Five Fast DVD on Babysteals. The rest is history; I now have all of her DVD's and downloads. Everything this woman puts out is awesome.

I completed this Pretty Fierce program about two months ago. It is an excellent program.  Lindsay stays true to her down to earth bubbly self, and even after doing the workouts over and over again, you don't get sick of her! These workouts are tough, but attainable and provide results. Prior to starting this series, I felt like I hit a plateau. I was within 10 pounds of my goal wait and the scale just was not moving. This series got the scale to move and even better I lost inches in my hips/thighs and waist. I even received compliments from family on my arm muscles.  It was exciting to watch my body gradually transform.

The workouts are fun and provide variety, which is key for me. I get bored easily.  Lindsay really knows what she is talking about and there is always a rhyme and reason behind her workouts. She stays up on the latest research so her workouts are always relevant and effective. She is great for everyone, but especially moms. She is a mother and knows how valuable our time is. She shows, through herself, that you can get your body back after kids. What I like is that she really focuses on working out smart, so you don't have to commit two hours to working out every day to look good.  She is about maximizing your time.

I promise that once you try it you too will be hooked on Lindsay Brin.  This is a purchase you will not regret!",1356652800,8,1602,4.316666666666666
5463722,5,B00AP88IYC,"I have been a fan of Lindays' work out DVDs since having my baby two years back.  Her workouts are straight to the point, quick and made especially for moms.  The best part is that results can be seen within the first few weeks.  Being chosen to be part of the R&D team of the Pretty Fierce program all I can say is WOW,  I lost 3 inches within the first two weeks and 5kgs in two months.  What's also great about Lindsay is that her story is truly inspiring she is a mother herself and goes through the same woes all of us moms face, so she understands what workout works and what doesn't.

These fun yet challenging workouts brought me to a new level and even boosted my confidence in myself and my abilities.  Overall I lost 8 inches and 8 lbs and felt very fit at the end  If you love Lindsay this will quickly become your new favorite!  If you have never worked out with Lindsay, try it!, you'll never go back!  (I have used her Prenatal and postnatal DVD's through all three of my pregnancies with great results every time)
I will say one thing as a ""heads up"", as with any program, the results are MUCH more dramatic and visible if you stick with Lindsay's eating reccomendations.

After the 2 week meal plan I lot 5 lbs! Then the holidays came and I ate terrible so I believe if I ate healthier I would have lost a whole lot more.
I loved that this program didn't take forever because with two little kids it is hard to find time to workout.  Lindsay did a great job explaining things and I didn't get injured at all which is saying something.  I always had my knees hurting with Julian Michaels.

8555634,5,B00AP88IYC,"I bought this from the momsintofitness website because it was cheaper there--but I  wanted to share the treasure I've found!!  I LOVE THESE WORKOUTS!!  They are still challenging for me (after 5 weeks) but there are enough modifications and I feel so good afterward that I keep showing up and getting though the 20 or 30 minutes each day.  The workouts are really different and very thoughtfully put together.  I'm never bored, and, though I'm a little sore sometimes, the next few days are arranged so that that part of my body can recover and come back stronger.  The results have been AMAZING--I've lost inches where I don't want them and gained definition where I do.  However, I think the real results have been that I feel stronger, better about myself, and have more energy to put into my family and life.

I had some specific needs/challenges and so contacted The Moms.  They were amazing and took time to help get me sorted out.  They really did care and want to help me succeed--which is a rare and powerful help in the struggle to make time (and make the most of the time I've made) to take care of my body, mind, and soul so that I can be the best and most effective version of myself.

She focuses on doing things for the right reasons and not just for how you look, though those benefits will come naturally anyway by doing the workouts. She gives you a comprehensive system, including a meal plan and nutrition advice so that you can make necessary changes to your lifestyle if that is a problem for you.

8555639,5,B00AP88IYC,"Quick background on me. I used to be in amazing shape before kids -- running 6 miles 3-4 times a week, lifting weights on other days, etc. I exercised through my first pregnancy and felt great. Then I got pregnant with baby number two and some health issues kicked in. I have trouble with adrenal fatigue. That means my body doesn't handle stress (less sleep, eating poorly, regular stress, strenuous exercise, pregnancy and nursing, etc.) well and it doesn't recover as quickly. During the process of having the last four of my five children I had periods where I struggled and other periods where I felt okay. Since strenuous exercise can make my health worse, I have had to back off at times and be really careful how much I do. I ran when I could between my pregnancies, etc. By the time I started the Pretty Fierce Weight Loss set I had had to stop jogging and was mostly walking. Even when I was running, the rest of me wasn't getting very toned which is why I wanted to do a workout like this.

This workout set is a beginner/intermediate level. If you don't do aerobic exercise a lot, they will be hard for you. If you do aerobic exercise how hard this is will be dependent on what type of exercise you do. I am a jogger so anything like running felt easy, but the jumping and other things I didn't usually do were harder for me.

Pros : I love that the workouts are short (20-30) minutes in the beginning and that there is so much variety. I feel like the moves hit the mommy trouble areas really effectively. The core series is really great at gradually building up your abdomen strength. I didn't have diastasis recti, but I had very little core strength after five babies. Trying really difficult core exercises was hard on my back, but this series was doable and I saw a difference in my stomach quickly. I really liked the weightlifting as well. As someone who usually exercises outside or at home, I wasn't familiar with a lot of the lifts and I found I really enjoyed them.

Cons: Although there are several other workouts, she repeats the Cardio Plyometrics and Tabata through the whole program. I got sick of these two a bit. If you are a hard core exerciser, these workouts may seem more easy. On days when I felt really good, I was able to do them relatively easily. You can make them harder based on how much energy/effort you put into them. They still felt like a decent workout, just not as physically challenging. I recommend you start here anyway to build up strength in your core and any other spots you might be missing. For instance, I struggled with jumping and lifting my knees.

The first time I went through these DVDs, I was feeling pretty exhausted. I had just weaned baby number five and I wasn't sleeping well. I would do a workout and have to recover for a few days. I loved that I didn't get painfully sore, I was just sore enough to feel which muscles had been worked. As the months went on, my health was in a better place and I began to feel like these were really helping me to tone up all over. I was loving how I looked. There were a few workouts that were harder for me the first time I did them. I found I hated them that first time and then liked them more and more as I did them.

Just before I went through the last couple of weeks of the calendar (still only doing these twice a week with a run once a week), I started painting my basement.  We were in the process of finishing it and it's a big space with lots of molding.  My body wasn't up to exercising and painting for 3-5 hours a day so I dropped exercising for a few months. I still looked good for quite a while, but once the painting was done and school started all of the stress added up to a health crash. Then I started eating poorly and put a bunch of the weight back on, probably more than I'd had on to begin with.

I began going through the workouts again a second time. This time I don't think I ate as well and the weight seemed to come off a bit slower. By the time I got through the whole calendar I felt like I was in pretty good shape even if I wasn't back to where I had been before taking a break to paint. I was able to do several things easily that had been difficult for me at the beginning. I have now moved on to the Pretty Fierce Lean. It has been significantly harder for me strength-wise. I like the workouts in Pretty Fierce Weight Loss better than the ones in Pretty Fierce Lean that I have done so far. The PF Lean has you doing things as fast as you can and it is harder to focus on form.

I really love this set and have recommended it to several people. I plan on continuing to rotate these workouts into my normal routine once I get through the PF Lean calendar.",1434326400,3,4701,4.237723214285714
