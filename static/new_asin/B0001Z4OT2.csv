2044181,5,B0001Z4OT2,"Shown on BBC America a few months ago, this is a series worth owning. Based on Val McDermid's book series, the shows are a trimmed down version of some of the stories. I recomend the books and the television series as they both hold their own.
The Wire in the Blood television series is dark, creepy, gritty, and compelling. These are psychological dramas that don't sugar-coat the crimes, the people, or the situations. They're not for everyone, but the majority of mystery/crime drama fans will find them more than satisfying.  The characters are well written and acted without being standard or cliche and the stories, while dark, are a compelling look into the psychology of criminal profiling and anaylysis.
Good characters, strong writing and high production standards is what really sells this series.",1089072000,59,808,5.075187969924812

2044202,3,B0001Z4OT2,"What I could understand of the dialog certainly reinforced the notion that this is a fine drama, with superior leads. Unfortunately, for many Americans of a certain age, and, perhaps others, at least half the words spoken are unintelligible. Unlike many of the British television series made primarily for the large export market, no concession has been made to that audience. British actors like Ian Carmichael, John Thaw, Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, and many others,  the English of these actors is not for export except for those with quite acute hearing and interpretive skill.
These are, as some reviewers have suggested, dark drama, not to be looked for light evening fare. They can be jolting. Yet, if in the mood for it, they can be stimulating entertainment.",1381017600,,767,5.039370078740157

2044204,5,B0001Z4OT2,"I love Robson Green but I was not familiar with this series. The production quality is good - the sound level is consistent - don't have to keep turning it up and then down to hear the dialogue. I look forward to watching the following seasons. First saw Robson Green in ""Touching Evil"" - another good series to own.",1362787200,,316,4.372881355932203
2044205,4,B0001Z4OT2,"Wire in the Blood is a good crime drama with a psychologist and detective inspector working together to solve crimes.  I like the show, but calling it fantastic or brilliant is over the top.  Robson Green and Hermione Norris work well together, and the chemistry is good.  In fact, that chemistry is the best part of the show.  The ""pilot"" story is the best of Season 1.  Stories 2 and 3 were not as tightly written.  Even in the pilot story, though, the gruesomeness is more implied than visual, possibly a reason that 2 and 3 are not as intense as 1.  But, probably nothing can live up to the image of a psycho wrapping a cone-shaped object with foil and barbed wire (You can't understand this statement until you've seen the show.).

I bought Season 1 and have watched it through three times.  I see on the internet that Norris leaves after Season 3.  Don't see how that void can be filled.  Buying Season 2 next.

Note that a series is three stories, each divided into two parts.",1359244800,,983,4.430167597765363

2044209,5,B0001Z4OT2,"I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Contemporary-Place-of-Execution/dp/B003F75MPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution</a>, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.

I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.

Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-running&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-One/dp/1569385882/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders - Set One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Inspector-Lynley-Mysteries/dp/B001D7T6N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries</a>, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.

The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:
The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.
Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.
Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.

The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.",1318204800,4,3311,5.877338877338877
2044210,5,B0001Z4OT2,... the Brits show that you can make a crime drama ten times better than anything Hollywood has to offer by casting actors in the lead roles instead of super-models :),1313884800,2,167,4.419354838709677
2044211,5,B0001Z4OT2,"Wire in the Blood shows once again why the UK are masters at crime and police procedurals.  Robson Green is absolutely amazing as Dr. Tony Hill.  The crimes are graphic, torturous, horrific and dark.  They show what pure evil truly is.  This is the type of programming that we will never find here in the U.S. since we are considered much too soft, prudish and I guess they just figure we can't handle it.  Wire in the Blood is dark and gritty and it's a great series.",1309046400,,468,4.333333333333333
2044222,5,B0001Z4OT2,"Val McDermid is the greatest English mystery writer since Agatha Christie. Her plots and its twists are every bit as intricate as Christie's. Her detectives are also just as unlikely as Poirot or Miss Marple, but the blood so much more freely than in Christie's works. These books and their screen adaptions are not cozies. The present horrifying crimes and criminals unflinchingly.

Meet Tony Hill. Tony is a psychologist, a professor at a fictional university in a fictional city that might be Manchester or Leeds or even York (although the accents are comprehensible unlike those in say&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Riding-Trilogy-Blu-ray/dp/B003NLE5KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Riding Trilogy [Blu-ray</a>]). Hill is drawn to police work, but while embracing the title of forensic psychologist he rejects the label ""profiler."" Hill is a bachelor, clumsy but straight, and seems to have a mild  of Aspergers. His talent is both intellectual and emotional. He draws elaborate schematics which show obscure connections of events and people. His emotional connection with the victim, killer and crime scene provide important understandings which lead to the solving of crime.

Hill is played by Robson Green, whose disheveled brilliance is eerily reminiscent of Columbo or even Bill Gates. Hermione Norris plays DCI Carol Jordan, his police mentor, in this first season, who sticks with Tony even when he is seemingly leading the investigation in the wrong direction.

The title apparently comes from a T.S. Elliot poem. McDermid says it means one thing, and Green has a different interpretation. Since McDermid wrote the book and picked the title I'd go with her explanation.",1298505600,,1731,5.6976744186046515
2044223,5,B0001Z4OT2,"For fans of the series Dexter, this is a phenomenal show that is intense from scene one, dramatically compelling and overall highly addictive.  There have been many reviews I've read that state that the series is overly graphic, and I had to pause since it was my 83 year old mother who borrowed the discs from the library that recommended the show to me.  Although my first reaction was to agree with some of the reviews, upon further contemplation I feel it is much more accurate to say the series is emotionally intense.  There really aren't graphic scenes of torture and murder as you would associate with a movie like Seven or Silence of the Lambs.  It's the visual images of the crime scenes that conjure up in your own mind the graphic images of how gruesome the murder must have been.  This is a BBC series and, full disclosure, I am a huge fan of British TV such as Dr. Who, Torchwood, Foyle's War, My Family, The Robinsons, The Worst Week of My Life and the classic, Fawlty Towers, to name a few.  The series are much shorter than in the United States in terms of episodes, but they are well written, produced and acted.  I highly recommend you give Wire in the Blood a try.",1285718400,,1184,4.428571428571429
2044224,5,B0001Z4OT2,"My favorite show from BBC outside of Top Gear. These are longer than American detective shows and also more thought out.

2044225,5,B0001Z4OT2,"Other reviewers have gone into the plot and acting. Just let me say that both are excellent. This series is certainly worth watching, but my wife and I will only watch one of these at a time. If we want to watch something else, we'll put on a Midsomer Murder for its jolly tone as the coppers drive about a beautiful landscape solving murders. This series is never jolly. It hits you in the gut. But it's wonderful acting!",1272499200,4,422,4.3544303797468356
2044226,1,B0001Z4OT2,"I found the Wire in the Blood series too graphic and full of torture for my taste. Homosexuality and torture are parts of every story, and mystery is overshadowed by a sense of deviate behavior. Not good viewing for healthy minds.",1268784000,10,230,4.634146341463414
2044227,3,B0001Z4OT2,"The best thing about this first season of the famous serial killer mysteries from the BBC is Robson Green as its protagonist, the brilliant but somewhat off-kilter Dr. Tony Hill, an expert in the psyches of murderers. Green's Hill has no annoying mannerly tics, despite the character's marked social awkwardness: you never seem to catch Green acting. But he slips right into the character of Tony Hill like a second skin, and sometimes is so believable as this man who can be so mild-mannered and affable in most situations but becomes extremely excited when working on a case with his partner, DCI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). Although Norris's part is much less interesting than Green's, the two get an agreeable rhythm going together, and you believe both in their mild flirtation and in their more important friendship, and most of all in their successful partnership in catching the surprising number of serial killers running amok in the fictional Northern city of ""Bradfield"" (which Newcastle upon Tyne doubles for in these productions). The first two two-part mysteries in this series are based on actual novels by the creator of Hill and Jordan, Val MacDermid; surprisingly, these are much weaker than the third story which is original to the show's screenwriters. The first of the three, ""The Mermaids Singing"" (all of the titles are taken from lines from T.S. Eliot's poetry), isn't very good at all as far as its plot goes: MacDermid seemed bent on outdoing Thomas Harris for how baroque her serial killer's M. O. is, which is less frightening than just silly (it involves duplicating medieval torture devices at what must be a ridiculous expense). You're better off here focusing on the interactions between Robson and Norris and at how they establish their characters. But by the third installment in the series, not only have they got their characters down pat, but the plot gets much better: this mystery, about a killer hunting down a series of jurors who acquitted a man accused of murdering a child, is genuinely suspenseful. Atmosphere in a series like this is everything, and the production team does fine work capturing the peculiar medieval echoes of the Northern English hills and fields; there's also a very effectively unnerving synthesizer score of mostly odd industrial sounds. The Hill series does get much better as it goes; the second year's dramas are much better plotted than the first year's.",1263340800,5,2429,5.029776674937965
2044228,5,B0001Z4OT2,"If you are looking for a detective series that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat throughout than this is the series.  The first season introduces you to the ""hero"" of the series - Dr. Tony Hill, brilliantly played by Robson Green. The quality of the writing, acting and directing will keep you watching.  Mr. Green's portrayal of Dr. Hill will most definitely have you wanting for more.  Enjoy!",1259280000,,412,4.616438356164384
2044229,5,B0001Z4OT2,"I just finished watching Season 1. This show, featuring two characters, Dr. Hill and Detective Carol Jordan, is gritty but great.  Dr. Hill is a clinical psychologist who has an ability to get into the minds of the serial killers and suspects.  He works with Detective Jordan to solve the serial killings in each episode.
Each show is in 2 50 minute segments, and it is just great televisioin from Britain.  While it is gory at times, it is very rich in story line and keeps you hooked.
I highly recommend it.",1240444800,2,509,4.510869565217392

2044231,5,B0001Z4OT2,"Season 1 of Wire (the only set of shows I had not previously seen) was as well made and engrossing as succeeding seasons have proven to be. Robson Green is perfectly cast as flawed psychologist Tony Hill, a man who empathizes with the criminals he helps to catch and whose compassion for the mentally ill does not interfere with his recognition of their guilt. Whether it's with Carol or Alex (his police contacts), he creates a relationship that is professional but with an underlying sexual tension. I hope this series continues to make new sets of shows for its devotees to enjoy.",1217635200,2,583,4.7254901960784315
2044232,2,B0001Z4OT2,"I must admit that I only watched about 45 minutes of the first episode, but that was because the torture scenes were WAY too graphic- hence the low review.  I love BBC crime dramas and am not squeamish at all (loved ""300"", ""Prime Suspect and ""Cracker"" for example) but some of these scenes were so over the top that I was unable to enjoy the movie; it made me sick to my stomach.  I realize that the episode was about a serial killer, but I have watched many other movies with similar themes that did not cross the line like this one.  I do wish I had sampled one of the other episodes to see if it was a little more watchable.  I did like both the leads.",1217548800,17,655,4.09375

2044234,5,B0001Z4OT2,Robson Green is mesmerizing as the socially inept and eccentric clinical psychologist.  The character is a departure from Green's usual more forceful commanding charaters.

2044236,3,B0001Z4OT2,"Robson Green's ""Wire in the Blood,"" a British television detective series, is actually made by Green's own production company - he's a big television star in the United Kingdom -- for Independent Television (ITV). The series is based upon the work of prize-winning British author Val McDermid, set in her fictional Midlands city of Bradfield, which she undoubtedly based upon the Midlands city of Manchester, where she worked as a journalist for 16 years, and still resides.  Furthermore, it's filmed in Manchester, in the English Midlands, which we don't see much of here (Green's a native of Newcastle, not all that far away.) It's a crime drama/police procedural, focusing largely on the capture of serial killers (a theme some of us may find overused), and it is gritty, sometimes gory.  And many Americans, me among them, must wish it had subtitles: between the local accent, and the softness with which the characters speak, it's very difficult to make out what's going on.

The series is nicely filmed, on location, and uses enough extras to make that location believable as a bustling city.  It boasts a good cast. Robson Green, to be sure, stars as Dr. Tony Hill, psychologist-academic-profiler, giving a substantial performance as an intense, intelligent, troubled, fallible, and flexible man.  He is ably supported by Hermione Norris as Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan; Emma Hardy as DC Paula McIntyre, and Mark Letheren as DS Kevin Geoffries.

However, ""Wire"" now advertises itself as ""based upon the characters created by"" McDermid, a relatively new author, who hasn't written nearly enough to keep a series going. Most episodes of the series are written by others. If you've never read her work, McDermid is a daring writer, who frequently breaks new ground; her best work is troubling, intensely gory and violent.  She is considered one of he leading lights of the British mystery school known as tartan noir: more bloody and violent than usual, lightened, occasionally, thank goodness by that bloody-minded Scots humor.  Written, self-evidently, by a Scot, which Mc Dermid is.

Episode 1 of the first series, ""I Hear the Mermaids Singing,"" is based upon the McDermid book of the same name,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mermaids-Singing-Dr-Tony-Hill-and-Carol-Jordan-Mysteries/dp/0312983603/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mermaids Singing (Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan Mysteries)</a>; an extremely bloody one, about a sadistic serial killer operating in the city's gay community.  It's been cleaned up considerably for TV.  Episode 2, ""Shadows Rising,"" is, in fact, based upon McDermid's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire-in-the-Blood-Dr-Tony-Hill-and-Carol-Jordan-Mysteries/dp/0312983654/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire in the Blood (Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan Mysteries)</a>.  It too, is an extremely gory book, about attractive young girls disappearing all over the country, later to be found murdered.  And it, too, has been cleaned up considerably for TV. The third episode presented, ""Justice Painted Blind,"" which is not based upon a McDermid work, is not only not up to McDermid's standard, it just doesn't deal with her usual material. Instead, it chooses to concern itself with the doings of someone seriously dissatisfied with the country's justice system.

""Wire in the Blood"" is a quote from a poem by T.S. Eliot; its meaning isn't entirely clear, even to McDermid, but we might as well call it an irresistible urge to kill.  Unfortunately, what with one thing and another, many Americans will have frustrating difficulties trying to follow this material. Therefore, I can't recommend it to anyone not, at least, familiar with McDermid's work.",1214438400,8,3782,5.69271758436945
2044237,5,B0001Z4OT2,"This series is so well written. I am a huge fan of pyschological thillers. I am always amazed at how ""Blood in the Wire"" keeps me guessing up to the very end of the show. Even when I think I know who did it, there is some great moments at the end of these episodes that make me think ""How did they ever think to do that?"". I have been a fan of Robson Green from his ""Touching Evil"" series, and this character suits him even better.

You will find yourself thinking of him like a modern day Columbo - he has a great mind, but bumbles his way through at times. You will love the little blue bag he carries around, like a symbol of his simple straightforward approach to solving a crime.",1214179200,2,684,4.104477611940299

Wire in the Blood's charachters are more real, gritty, and human. The show is dark and artfully done, and I think it probes real minds more than any US show. Tony Hill is an amazing charachter and Robson G. is a brilliant actor. Tony is a socially inept clinical psychologist with a talent for catching serial killers. The show is not cheesy though. Tony has to walk a thin line between madness and sanity to catch his killer. The overall tone also has you sort of on edge, as to whether, Tony himself would ever cross over from helper to killer. The actress whom plays Carol Jordan also is a good, real, and gritty persona of a woman trying to keep her name and respect in the male dominated law enforcement enviornment. Of course, we all love the chemistry and subtle flirtations between Tony and Carol, and we see them deveolp a very loving and respect based bond.

The TV series, while based on the books, changes the storylines around quite a bit, especially Shadows Rising (episode 2) which was based on the original book Wire in the Blood that gave the series its title. The book is far too complex to convert well to even the small screen in a reasonable time. The adaptation is excellent, and very well suited to the two hour format.

In many ways it's the best of both worlds - both the books and the show are excellent, and sufficiently different that they are enjoyable quite independent from each other. If you buy this and enjoy it, make sure you get the books too - you won't be disappointed.",1190332800,4,700,4.46875

2044254,4,B0001Z4OT2,I discovered this through BBC America during the 4th season and had to order the previous 3.  Excellently written and acted.  Robson Green is an amazing actor and should be better known in the US.,1168300800,2,196,4.571428571428571

2044256,5,B0001Z4OT2,"Based on the novels by Val McDermid, Wire in the Blood is a gritty, rivetting, suspenseful psychological crime drama; it is also, without a doubt, one of the best series of that genre around.  Robson Green (Touching Evil, Reckless, Me & Mrs. Jones, The Student Prince, The Gambling Man, Grafters, Soldier Soldier) stars as Dr. Tony Hill, a clinical psychologist who moonlights as a criminal profiler for the police.  Tony is brilliant in his ability to gain insights into the criminal mind, but his brilliance comes at a cost, compensated as it is by an equal degree of social ineptitude.  Like an absent-minded professor, Tony has a mind so focused that he easily becomes oblivious to his surroundings and to those around him.  It doesn't help matters that he talks to himself or that he finds it helpful to physically act out various aspects of the crime in question--things that are best NOT done in a public place!  Though the storylines are very serious--even chilling--the very nature of Tony's character provides the occasional welcome moment of lightness and humour.  Those familiar with Robson Green will know that this is the type of character at which he excels--characters which are, at the very least, just a little bit odd.

Tony's connection with the police is via Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris--Cold Feet's Karen Marsden), a shrewd, hard-working cop, who is well aware of Tony's brilliant mind and of his value to the police.  There exists almost from the start--and always beneath the surface--a mutual attraction between Tony and Carol, and it is here that Tony most poignantly feels his lack of social skills.

There are, at the time of writing, two sets on dvd (with set three due for release in February 2006).  Set one contains three episodes (each presented as two back-to-back 50 minute episodes); set two contains four 100-minute episodes.  DVD extras on set one are limited to brief text-based bios, but set two consists of interesting and informative interviews with Robson Green, Hermion Norris, author Val McDermid, and the production team.

Though this is a series, each episode is movie length, and I would challenge anyone to find a Hollywood crime drama as good as any one of the episodes in this outstanding series.  If you enjoy top quality, impeccably-acted, gritty, dark, intelligent psychological crime drama which draws the viewer right in--shows like BBC's Waking the Dead, for example--you will definitely enjoy this series, and I recommend both sets without hesitation.  I enjoyed the series so much that I bought McDermid's latest Tony Hill novel, The Torment of Others (2004), which I also thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend.  Personally, I can't wait for the release of set three, and I hope Koch Vision continues to release future sets as they become available!

Very highly recommended!",1136592000,86,2864,5.074626865671642
2044257,5,B0001Z4OT2,Excellent thriller series. The ubiquitous Robson Green is up to his elbows in unique but very gory murders.,1123891200,6,107,5.0
2044258,5,B0001Z4OT2,"An excellent series if a little gruesome in the crime pictures. After that, it is an interesting interplay between the regular British police and the 'absent minded professor' type role of the psychologist. Well acted and excellent scenery set mostly in the North of England.",1120608000,4,275,5.133333333333334
2044259,4,B0001Z4OT2,"I wrote an earlier review...

This is still a series worth buying. I did notice on Series 1, the dvd is in full-screen while it was aired in wide-screen on BBC America.  Most people would never notice this, but composition is off in some scenes and lighting is blown-out in other ones.
It's a small and subtle change to certain portions of the episodes.

Still worth buying.",1106092800,18,374,4.552238805970149
2044260,5,B0001Z4OT2,"I am a person who reads copiously and I am invariably disappointed with the TV adaptations to my fave books - but not this time.
Robson Green is brilliant as Dr. Tony Hill. The stories are portrayed as grittily as they are on paper.
The same suspense, excitement and horror is there. Some of Val Macdermids Tony Hill series have been scaled down for television, but the ensuing TV versions make for exciting viewing. Realistic without being depressing, Violent without becoming nauseous, I would reccommend the Wire in the Blood series to any crime drama buff. Those of you who loved Prime Suspect will not be disappointed with this.",1097020800,36,633,4.81651376146789
2044261,4,B0001Z4OT2,"I found this series especially delightful because Robson Green's character lives within the confines of his own mind. Though he shows remarkable insight into the actions of the violent and deranged, he also displays that phenomenal lack of social consciousness that is particular to geniuses and artists (as in ""Yes, I just invented nuclear fission, but no, I didn't know I was supposed to wear socks and shoes to this award ceremony.""). This makes for some truly unusual and amusing situations, that help bring levity to the gruesome crimes he investigates. If you like Touching Evil or Monk, this series may be for you.",1091664000,26,621,4.980769230769231

I've had this problem before with DVDs from Koch Vision Entertainment.  Their quality control is laughable -- or rather, infuriating.  I would have to think long and hard before I'd risk buying anything with the Koch Vision logo on it.  3 out of 9 items made by Koch vision that I have bought have been defective.",1431475200,,529,4.422680412371134
