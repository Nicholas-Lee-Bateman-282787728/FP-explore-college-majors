8435705,5,B004M9QNYC,I saw part of this once before on the History Channel and wanted to watch the whole program . I found this to be very interesting on how they were able to take the mask and make it come alive . To find out that the wrong mask has been used for Napoleon is remarkable . Watching how they back track John Dillinger image was vert interesting . This show was well done and I will watch it again,1456704000,,391,3.962025316455696
