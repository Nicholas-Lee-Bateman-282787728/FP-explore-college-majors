...Because this IS a story, and No Surrender is like part 1 of 3. For a short time, lasting from September to November 2007, TNA Wrestling actually looked like the next big promotion and valid alternative to WWE they had always promoted themselves as. After a bunch of flawed PPVs,  dreadful storylines like VKM/Christy Hemme and Sting/Abyss that almost destroyed Abyss' character, and some typically awful Russo gimmicks like Black Reign and 'The Guru' Sonjay Dutt, expectations had sunk pretty low. But TNA suddenly rebounded here with a strong performance. With Impact finally getting two hours on Spike TV and Bound For Glory just around the corner, everyone in this company stepped up and proved that they had a winning formula within their grasp.

**THE SHOW**
First let's get the bad stuff out of the way, because there are still a few problems here. Look no further than Adam 'Pacman' Jones, the football player who was briefly signed by TNA during his suspension from the NFL. They wasted no time booking him into an angle with Ron Killings where they went for the TNA Tag Team Championship. The problem? Pacman Jones couldn't wrestle. I don't mean he was a BAD wrestler--that would have been the best-case scenario. I mean the NFL wouldn't even allow him to physically compete. Also, he had no ring presence and couldn't cut a promo. And they put him out there with Sting and Kurt Angle for the titles in the opening match of this show. Ouch.

Despite the bad start, No Surrender turns into a great night of wrestling. A.J. Styles goes the distance in a thrilling half-hour battle royal with 19 other wrestlers to decide the new number one contenders for the Tag Team Titles. No matter which team won, they would have been the favorites against Team Pacman, but I think they made the right decision here. Rhino puts an exclamation point on his controversial feud with 'Cowboy' James Storm in an above-average brawl. Robert Roode and Kaz both look great, with the reactions of Ms. Brooks adding something extra to their match.  Samoa Joe and Christian Cage tear the house down in a grudge match with a chaotic ending to set up a Bound For Glory rematch. Black Reign and 'Wildcat' Chris Harris do their part just by not stinking up the ring.

The biggest story of the night is Kurt Angle who comes into the show holding AND defending all three major championships. After the disappointing tag match, he puts on a clinic against an impressive 'Black Machismo' Jay Lethal for the X-Division Title that ends with one of the biggest upsets in TNA history. Finally he defends the World Title against Abyss in the main event where the Monster puts on a true wrestling performance; no thumbtacks, no barbwire bats, and no James Mitchell...at least, not until later.

**THE VERDICT**
A strong show that promised greater things to come for TNA. With the DVD out of print and getting harder to find, it may soon be a lost piece of history. If you haven't seen it, I recommend getting it while you still can. No Surrender '07 set the stage for two even better shows to come: Bound For Glory and Genesis.",1432339200,,3114,4.7150735294117645
8247328,4,B0012QH0LS,"Late 2007 is arguably the finest time in TNA's history; it was the point where the promotion's in ring product and outside notoriety seemed to be in harmony and alluded to good things for the future. If you were to watch Bound for Glory that year, you might find yourself think, ""These guys might be able to compete with the WWE!""

All that promise didn't amount to much of anything, but for a couple of years, TNA would flirt with graduating to the next level and a lot of that momentum came from this time when everything seemed to be clicking.

Kurt Angle entered No Surrender with the Tag Team Titles, X Division Title and TNA Championship thanks to an All Or Nothing match against Samoa Joe the month before. The kicker was that Angle was forced to defend all the titles here in three matches. The opening tag team match where Sting teamed with Angle was little more than an angle to set up a match between the two at Bound for Glory, Jay Lethal had a great match with Angle for the X Division Title, and Abyss tore the house down with Angle for the TNA Championship.

Other good matches included Samoa Joe vs. Christian and the #1 Contender Tag Team Gauntlet Match. There are some mediocre matches as well, but most of the matches are worth the money and several are outright outstanding. This is one of the better PPVs they produced so check it out.",1408147200,,1356,4.437751004016064
8247329,4,B0012QH0LS,"The Tag Team title match between Sting & Kurt Angle against Team Pacman(Adam ""Pacman"" Jones & Ron ""The Truth Killings) was awful mainly because most of the action was off-camera. The Rhino-James Storm match was a fun little brawl to say the least. The Robert Roode-Kaz match was a good competitive match-up. The X-Division title match between Jay Lethal & Kurt Angle was good for a X-Division match. The Chris Harris-Black Reign match stinks like a 30 year hamburger. The Tag Team Gauntlet match was not great but pretty good. The Christian Cage-Samoa Joe match while not a bad bout,it's not as good their match from Destination X. The Worlds title match between Kurt Angle & Abyss was a good technical heel vs monster babyface contest with Abyss trying to use his power in the face of Angle's strategy. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1352592000,,834,4.641891891891892
8247330,4,B0012QH0LS,"TNA Tag Team Champions Kurt Angle & Sting vs. Team Pacman - Who would have ever thought that Sting would be in the a PPV opening match in this stage of his career?  Anyways, this was just something to put over upcoming storylines such as Sting ""slapping"" Karen Angle & Angle defending his wife's honor by Angle Slamming Sting & costing their team the tag team titles to Ron Killings & Pacman Jones. Yes, a football player who's not allowed to wrestle became a tag team champion...at least Vince Russo & David Arquette were allowed to touch the wrestlers.

Rhino vs. James Storm - This was the conclusion of a very underrated fued for 2007.  This was an unofficial ""no DQ"" match as it was put over that Cornette told the referee to give the match some leeway.  The went around the Impact Zone with brawling in the crowd & bleachers with Storm being tossed into the wall at one point...and then the opening bell rang.  The match itself was intense & ended with Rhino finally getting his revenge on Storm...and even got one in on Jackie Moore too.

Kaz vs. Robert Roode - I thought this was a battle of the two breakout stars as both men have shown potential before & after this match, you would have no doubt that they could be the next face/heel the company could put some stock into.  It was a really good match as the story surrounding what Ms. Brooks is going to do was a good addition to the story here as well.

X Division Champion Kurt Angle vs. Jay Lethal - This match was TNA's version of the ""Little Engine That Could"" since Lethal was heavily put over as the major underdog who didn't have a chance in hell with even Lethal looking shocked at some of the moves he got in on Angle like the Lethal combination.  However, both men put on the type of performance that makes a star overnight as you saw the audience get into the match more as time went on while Angle helped Lethal not only look like a million bucks...but losing CLEANLY after a roll up.  The biggest upset in TNA history...DIG IT! (sorry, couldn't help myself)

Chris Harris vs. Black Reign - In a nutshell, this match was real short with Harris just beating up Reign non-stop at the beginning with Reign getting a few punches in before Harris hit the small package for the win eventhough Reign got the last word with ""Misty"" afterwards.  It was way better than their match at Hard Justice...but that's not saying much.

Tag Team Gauntlet - The rules are that when both members of a team are eliminated from the battle royal, they're out. When two wrestlers are remaining, they're partners come back for a tradition tag team match.  It was your typical battle royal until it got settled inbetween the Motor City Machine Guns & Christian's colliation of A.J. Styles & Tomko after somewhat close to 30 mins.  The match itself was again short but very fun to watch in that time as it turned into a showcase of MCMG's combination moves before A.J. & Tomko got the victory.

Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe - If you saw Destination X before this match & Bound For Glory after this match, you know that these two together will either steal the show or give one of the best matches of the night...this was no exception.  They were more aggressive here than their DX match and had the crowd heavily into it.  The ending may have seemed like a jip with Christian getting the DQ win but it didn't take away from the encounter itself as the point was to put over Joe's anger & wanting revenge...setting up the Bound For Glory rematch.

It was around here they made the annoucement that was being plugged all night in that Impact was becoming a 2 hour show.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. Abyss - If your expecting the typical Abyss ""hardcore mayhem"" type of match here that he's in around 95% of the time...you'll be suprized as you got the performance out of Abyss that you don't normally get.  A good story being told throughout the match with Angle targeting & just beating on Abyss' leg to the point where he got his boot off during one point in the match.  Third match was the charm as Kurt Angle was able to keep the World Title by making Abyss tap out.

In the end, this was one of TNA's best PPV's of the year as there were only two flops...but one was just there to start a storyline.  Highly recommended here and major props & respect to Kurt Angle for his efforts here in his matches on this night.",1200960000,3,4365,4.413965087281795
