4719259,2,B005L0XY02,This DVD is too complicated . If you are a beginner  in fitness and your stretching is not so good this DVD is not for you. Buy something else. You have to be in prefect shape to preform this DVD. I was very disappointed with it when I tried to do it.,1364515200,3,251,3.826923076923077

4719262,3,B005L0XY02,i didn't really care for this cd because it was repetitive. i love the core power workout and this one was good but boring because it was the same set of exercise in 3 of segments.,1357430400,2,180,4.027777777777778
4719263,4,B005L0XY02,"I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews of this DVD.  This was the first I tried of Elisabeth Halfpapp and Fred DeVito's Exhale: Core Fusion DVD series, and I was impressed.  I then went on to try 5 other DVDs from their series, and in the end, this was the only one I liked.  It starts with a great stretching segment, and then proceeds into a series of 10-minute workouts that integrate yoga poses with all-over strength training.  The light weights seemed like a joke at first, but after enough reps and hitting the muscles at different angles (also using slightly heavier weights than they appeared to be using--5's and 10's in each hand), I was plenty fatigued by the time I reached the end of each segment.  I liked that everything is done in sets (or multiples) of 8, so you know more or less what to expect instead of wondering when an exercise will be over.  Halfpapp and DeVito are very good at cuing and explaining movements, and they do so while performing the exercises, unlike some of their videos where they provide only semi-accurate voiceover narration.  I also like that they're relatively mellow and encouraging; it's a nice change from Jillian Michaels, whose DVDs I also like.",1348444800,15,1203,4.672985781990521
4719264,5,B005L0XY02,"This video is amazing!

Although some of them can be extremely challenging, most of them are pretty easy and you still get the benefits as well!

I love3 this video so much because you can do it for how long as you like. As this being my first yoga video i bought (even though its yoga combined with Pilates and strength training) the trainers were so perfect! They were not annoying or overbearing, but they were calm and focused and i like that!

DEFINITIVELY RECOMMEND!",1335830400,3,472,4.529411764705882
4719265,1,B005L0XY02,"As an avid fan of the core fusion series, I was shocked at this dvd.  First off, the quality of the filming is atrocious.  Often part of the picture is blurred ( I wondered to myself if this was a copy of a copy)...absolutely terrible camera quality.  The set is all one tone of yellow and it looks terrible- nothing like the other dvds in the series (I own all of them).  I still cannot believe that they released this.  As for the workout, it is okay but with a name like power sculpt I was definately expecting a bit more...all in all, save your money to buy something else.",1327449600,9,577,4.209090909090909
4719266,3,B005L0XY02,"I love Core Fusion, as shown by my previous reviews, but I was disappointed with this DVD. It is essentially a remake of Core Fusion Energy Flow without the Sun Salutations. Perhaps this DVD is a sign that they shouldn't produce two DVDs at the same time.

Power Fusion (Liz) -
This flow is very similar to the first segment from Energy Flow.  It starts with a standing forward bend with twist, cat cow variations (adding in some twists to stretch the upper body), child's pose, single leg downward dog, low runner's lunge variations....The stretches felt a bit deeper on this DVD, making me think it might have been better at the end of the DVD instead of as the opening segment.  And similar to Energy Flow, it ends with a series of planks, adding in weights during the side planks.

Strength Flow (Fred) -
Power Flow (Liz) -
These two segments replace the Sun Salutations from Energy Flow for those that aren't fans of those, but for me this didn't provide much of a workout.  You stay in static poses - Warrior I, chair pose, standing balance with heel of one foot resting against calf of other foot,  standing side body stretch, Warrior II, reverse Warrior, Triangle - adding in upper body weight work or twists.
The static poses are connected by a vinyasa of high plank, one or four pushups, up dog, and down dog, but the emphasis is on the static poses with weights.

Strength & Balance (Liz) -
This segment is similar to Chi Gong & Hip Opener Stretches from their Energy Flow DVD, focusing on wide leg squats, balance, and hip stretches.  Starts with wide leg (second position) squat movements, adding in weights. They do an extended tree pose while doing upper body weights (I love balance work and liked this section). They then move into something similar to Warrior 3 with one hand down, doing weight work with the other arm while holding the pose. The segments wraps up with some hip stretches. For me, this segment was one of the bright points on this DVD.

Abs & Glutes (Fred) -
Begins with Core Fusion c-curve ab work.  The ab portion is short at only about 4 minutes, however the leg variations make it challenging.  Then similar to Energy Flow, they move into various bird dog variations to work the glutes - but adding in a weight behind the raised knee.  Although this segment was very similar to Energy Flow, I liked the additional challenge it added.

Stretch with Weights (Fred) -
The use of weights seemed rather forced to me through most of this segment.  Includes similar poses to Energy Flow - bridge, plow, spinal twist, child's pose, seated side bend, - adding weights throughout.
Not a bad segment, but I didn't love it as much as I usually do Core Fusion ending stretches.

************
All in all, I didn't get much of a leg workout from this DVD.  I just didn't love it as much as I do their others.  I can see myself using some segments as add-ons to other workouts, but I don't see myself repeating the entire DVD.  As I completed this DVD, the one thought that came to mind was that I would really like Fred & Liz to return to their roots and make another barre DVD.",1315094400,33,3102,4.508928571428571

I've lost so much weight using their DVDs.
If they had classes closer to where I live I would go.  This is much better than Shaun T, Tae Bo, or Jillian Michaels.  I've tried them all and only lost 15 lbs in 1 1/2 years.  Using this DVD in 1 month I lost 8 lbs.  I'm hoping to collect all of their DVDs.",1438128000,2,339,3.9411764705882355

I felt nicely worked out in the end, but some of the moves felt a little awkward to me and the workout didn't seem to flow as nicely as the others.  Still a good workout, just not one of their best.

4719284,5,B005L0XY02,it combines basic yoga with some basic weight exercises. I had been using 3lb weights with other core fusion dvds but upped it to 5lbs weights and what a great challenge. Awesome if you want to get really toned and not bulky.,1379116800,2,225,4.380952380952381
4719285,5,B005L0XY02,"Very good video, I would totally recommend this to anyone asking. The exercises are very challenging because you have to balance in a yoga pose while doing them, therefore asking more of my core, which really needs work. For instance, curls on one foot, I had very sore core muscles and never did a crunch! All the stretches are really good too. The only thing I didn't like, is that they don't always give you a good view of the gal doing the beginner version of all the exercises, but after doing it a few times you get the hang of it!",1375228800,3,537,4.2745098039215685
4719286,5,B005L0XY02,"Ok I'm a 55 year old guy, that usually does Bowflex and TaeBo. I have many exercise DVDs. I do TaeBo if I want something aerobic, Bob Harper for a personal trainer vib, and Core Fusion for a 'spa' vib. ...I'm probably not your typical Core Fusion Customer.

I tried Core Fusion's Body Sculpt as a starter, frankly thinking it would be easy. It wasn't, it's different than anything else I do and was pretty tough, ...also a great place to start. Not a lot of hyper movement, Core Fusion is a strength in stillness type workout. My other favorite Core Fusion is the Yoga Energy Flow, which is mostly Yoga, some TaeChi, and some Core Fusion to round out the workout. It's a good DVD for someone wanting to try Yoga without too much Sanskrit. It works your balance a bit. Core Fusion Powersculpt builds on Yoga Energy Flow. It is Yoga but with hand weights. It has a similar but enough different exercise flow.

I'd get Yoga Energy Flow First, if you like that and want something that complements it, grab Powersculpt it's a great workout. You can tune the difficulty with the size of the weights you use. ...or do a selection of the 10 minute focus sections. Great video, I have it in my rotation once a week. ...Thank you Core Fusion.",1375228800,11,1232,4.446902654867257
