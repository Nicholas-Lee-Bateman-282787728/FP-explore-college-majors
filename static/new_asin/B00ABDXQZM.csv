8549782,3,B00ABDXQZM,"I was disappointed with this movie. It leads nowhere and the parallel tracks of the various characters is just an excuse for not being able to develop a plot. As in many other Israeli movies, the end is not well written. Also as in so many other Israeli movies, the film is very depressing beneath all the humor and wit. Watching Israeli movies makes me think that this people is seriously scarred by wars and persecutions. They (we) are all basically refugees or descendants of refugees, even though they don't view themselves as such. Also, someone who did not grow up in Israel would not understand or be able to relate to the ""Gashash"" underlying theme. The use of Arabic slang is OK but a bit excessive - Israelis like to swear in Arabic and Russian, but not that much.",1402876800,,774,4.535714285714286
