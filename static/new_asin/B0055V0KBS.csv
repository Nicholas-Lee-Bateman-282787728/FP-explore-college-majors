8458872,4,B0055V0KBS,"The principle problem with hentai is actually pretty basic; as a spectator sport, sex tends to be boring, and while there are a number of things one can do to improve matters with the artwork, fundamentally it comes down to the writing.  No amount of exquisite artwork can save a poorly written hentai, while a well written hentai can survive a lot less than exquisite artwork.  This brings us to Daiakuji: The Xena Buster, one of the most intriguing concepts Ive ever heard of in a hentai story, but not one the creators fully made use of.

In a parallel universe feminist Womenrica (WIME) won their WWII and forced a female-centric constitution upon defeated Japan (This is actually closer to the truth than you might think because while it is easy to sneer today about 1945 levels of feminism, the US was actually substantially ahead of Imperial Japan as the WAVEs and the WACs for which there really was no Japanese equivalent demonstrated.).  So it is to a vastly changed Osaka with women in charge everywhere that Akuji Yamamoto, former yakuza criminal and former POW, returns after three years of absence, during which time his father was killed in the war and his grandfather disappeared.  However, what he discovers upon returning is that one of his grandfathers lovers has taken control of the crime family and boots him out of it.  Well, desperate times call for desperate measures, and soon Akuji is building his own crime family from a combination of the female Youth Services Group that he seduces (quite literally) and loyal (mostly male) members of his old crime family and some of their old rivals with the goal of dominating Osaka while avoiding the understandably hostile eye of the WIME Occupying Forces.  It is kill or be killed,... while having as much sex as possible.

The concept is brilliant; unfortunately, the resulting plot is a lot less brilliant.  The 7 episodes, 8 if you count the preview episode 0 on the first disc separately, run like this:

0: Why?  Why?  Daiakuji: Sets up the story,... and the first slave girl.

1: The Return of Daiakuji:
2: Fight Back: Akuji and his new gang defeat his old gang,... but at considerable cost.

3. Battle of Lusty Nuns:
4. Forbidden Lust - Yumi God: The battle against the strange religion of Nako-Kyo.

5. Sexy Freedom Fighters:
6. Last of Inabella: The battle against WIME or parts of WIME at least as Dr. Inabellas secret plan comes to fruition.

7. Sat-Chans Story: Astonishingly, after all that has gone before, a sweet and touching love story,... with lots of sex, of course.

Kudos where kudos are due; the premise is a brilliant take off on the very real struggle the Japanese had in adjusting to being conquered by those mysterious, all but incomprehensible Americans who stubbornly, arrogantly, but for the most part fairly brilliantly set about their self-appointed task of rebuilding Japan into a nation they could live with, ally with, and shape a good deal of the modern world with,... all while having only the barest grasp of understanding each other.  And the final episode is as sweet and tender and loving as anyone could ask.

Defects?  Well, they certainly exist.  In particular I think the climax of the series in episodes 5 and 6 needed to be truly doubled in length because way too much story is crammed in there; you will probably have to rewatch it just in order to figure out everything that is going on.  However, I think the biggest problem comes in the general treatment of women.  It is one thing to show women being mistreated by the bad guys (some of whom ARE women), it is quite another to show captured bad women being mistreated by the good guys, arguably as punishment, but it is off the charts disturbing to show innocent women being deliberately mistreated by the good guys in order to convert them into willing, even eager prostitutes!  Yeah, I realize that the good guys are all basically yakuza members, but good grief!  I don't think you will be watching this show with your wife or your girlfriend, or she won't be your wife or your girlfriend by the end of it!

A second problem is the miserably minimum attempts at quality control.  Why the double sided discs?  So nobody has to redesign the menus intended for single sided discs!  The English subtitles are in a number of places flat out missing; not enough to confuse the story, but certainly enough to notice and to annoy.  Episode 4 doesnt even let you change from having the English subtitles turned on, which is better than it could have been I suppose!  Only the last disc is a single sided disk; it is also the only one with an English voice acting option or an English subtitles option for the Bonus Material.  I can understand not doing an English voice track for a series in order to save money, but who the heck does a partial?

In the end a fairly brilliant concept is all too often turned into Yet Another Excuse for sexually abusing cute looking girls/women.  A lot was certainly done, but a lot more could have been done.",1520380800,,5006,4.676940639269406

Instead of killing them, they rape them for slavery. I have seen other hentai anime series, but not like this one before. This is only a recommendation to hentai anime fans due to its X rated content. NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFENDED BY THIS KIND OF X RATED CONTENT!",1387238400,2,426,4.405063291139241
