2582854,5,B000FS2WKI,"I bought this video a short time ago and was shocked and outraged to discover what is going on in our own country and with the powers to be that control our country. While watching this video I was flooded with emotions: anger, outrage, fear, and a deep sadness at the depths of evil humans are capable of perpetrating onto other human beings in the name of money, profits and power! I watched the video 3 times and it has now circulated amongst my community and friends. I actually have a waiting list of those waiting to borrow it. Some that have borrowed it have now bought their own copies along with the book by the same title. I highly recommend everyone watch this video whether you borrow it, rent it or buy it, you must watch it! I suggest watching it more than once, as he talks a bit fast (and compassionately) and you want to absorb and remember everything he says. What I admire about this video is that he does not ask anyone to take his word at face-value, or by his credentials, he shows you the proof. He explains in detail how he discovered the proof and in the book has reprinted the documents that are proof.",1184803200,23,1128,4.350710900473934

2582856,5,B000FS2WKI,"He gives step by step tie-ins to vaccines,  Gulf War Syndrome,  HIV, SV-40, etc. Call me a tin foil hat/conspiracy theorist,  but there are way too many coincidences to not consider that they are related.",1510963200,2,204,4.771428571428571
2582857,1,B000FS2WKI,"The other side. My child had all of his vaccinations. Even though he was an athletic, healthy child, his immune system is weak. The vaccinations prevented him from dying, so he survived whooping cough and other preventable illness.

Your child's immune system might be strong enough to fight off these horrible diseases, but they carry and spread the virus to others who are unable to fight it off. How many people must die, often infants, before the madness stops?

Real science has proven there isn't a link between autism and vaccines. Statistics confirm the success of the vaccine program. We are one of only a few countries to deny global warming. With the help of the internet and stuff like this, maybe 'elite' are winning?",1509926400,2,730,4.832
2582858,1,B000FS2WKI,Useless conspiracy nonsense. Not based on fact. Don't waste the time or money.,1509494400,4,78,5.076923076923077

2582860,1,B000FS2WKI,Tinfoil-hat conspiracy gibberish. The only people impressed by this are likely to be already in the blame-the-government-for-everything crowd. That's 2+ hours I won't ever get back.,1508112000,3,181,6.0
2582861,5,B000FS2WKI,Based on the best-selling book and well worth the time from a great presenter and author.,1499558400,3,89,4.625

2582863,1,B000FS2WKI,"This is a two hour long video of ""Dr"" leo horowitz pacing in front of a podium, and it looks like it was filmed on a circa-1970's camera.  His ideas that AIDS and Ebola were invented by the US government is a ludicrous joke, wholly unsupported by the evidence that abounds in the literature.  His claims are shaky, his evidence has holes you could drive a truck through, and his knowledge of viral evolution and vaccinology is spotty at best.  This guy couldn't pass an undergraduate class on molecular biology - don't take your medical advice from him.  The only thing that is funnier than his theories is the fact that a lot of people seem to be buying them hook, line and sinker.  Did I say funny?  I meant tragic.  Google this guys name, he has a publishing company named Tetrahedron, and on his website you can buy books on subjects that vary from ""emerging viruses and vaccinations"" to ""Love - the real da vinci code"" and bottles of colloidal silver, and his product made from plant roots that will cure SARS.  Also, he believes that listening to music tuned to 528Hz will make you healthy and improve your well being/love life. Yep, this guy is a quack of the highest degree.  Think BigPharma is trying to take your money?  He wants it too, only his books & colloidal silver water cost more than vaccines and won't do anything for you.  Also, he now runs a hotel in hawaii.... yep, this guy is totally legit.",1282348800,8,1415,4.48828125
2582864,5,B000FS2WKI,"A must see DVD.  Dr. Horowitz extensively investigates the issue of vaccines and succinctly explains the hidden dangers.  The DVD is a great summary of a very complicated issue.  For a more in depth review of vaccines, I would recommend the book by the same title and author.",1279670400,10,275,4.6875
8125861,2,B000FS2WKI,"I watched, found the documentary interesting but he didn't cite any research. He basically made claim, after claim without any scientific supporting evidence. He found some old documents from the 60s and spun a tale appealing to fear and suspicion. Do corporations and government screw up sometimes; yup. Is there corruption; yup. Read, Research (not just a single source, but seek opposing views) and make the best section based on what you know. Don't let ""what ifs"" get in the way of common sense. Also, even a broken clock is right twice a day; nowhere is that more evident than in this documentary. Topic went from medical to Nazis. I gave this 2 stars because we should challenge norms, question policy and do our research but that doesn't mean we should follow blindly. Talking and saying something is so doesn't make it true. Horowitz offers nothing other than his opinion. We can all agree he has conviction but citing random facts doesn't make his story true.",1518393600,,969,4.843373493975903
8125862,1,B000FS2WKI,thanks i hate it. y'all are so dumb and paranoid.,1516147200,,49,4.0
8125863,1,B000FS2WKI,This crackpot is dangerous,1515196800,3,26,5.75
8125864,1,B000FS2WKI,"crazy and dangerous.  For instance, he stated that when he was giving a lecture on the origin of AIDS no one from the American media came, but there were hundreds of Canadian reporters that showed up.  Supposedly, the American press was controlled by the US government, and, thus, were not allowed to come.  Really?  Yet, the Canadians showed and did a myriad of reporting  from videos to press releases on his ideas.  Where are those video and press releases?",1514332800,4,460,4.7594936708860756
8125865,3,B000FS2WKI,This doc should be watched but with one warning. The information presented may not be accurate. Good research should always be crossed referenced for accuracy. Horowitz is an excellent showman but his facts are hard to confirm.,1514246400,3,227,5.162162162162162
8125866,5,B000FS2WKI,"What a powerhouse of information here!  Be open and learn the truth and/or have your suspicions confirmed.  You will not regret watching this video.  Thank you, Dr. Horowitz!",1513900800,,174,5.142857142857143
8125867,5,B000FS2WKI,"Excellent data. I highly recommend it; although I'm sure many will dismiss it as conspiracy theory, and if they work for CDC or USPHS might refuse to watch it.",1513814400,,159,4.517241379310345
8125868,5,B000FS2WKI,"I just watched this on Amazon Prime and I am blown away. I had my own assumptions an he just solidified my suspicions. He provides legitimate evidence to back up his claims. I knew about much of what he brought up, but he added much more depth to it. I highly recommend this movie if you have an open mind, otherwise your denial and cognitive dissonance will get in the way of your reason and ability to learn the truth.",1513296000,,420,4.2625
8125869,5,B000FS2WKI,This information about vaccines are correct as so about Aids and the Ebola viruses. Dr Boyd Graves also has confirmed what Dr Leonard Horowitz is saying. It's way to much information out their now to turn a blind eye to what's going on. It was true that the government gave the African Americans Syphilis in Thang we back in the days and the Georgia Guidestones is a testament to what's to come. Great video of expose of what's really going on. On the ignorant and blind will make fun of real truth.,1512691200,,499,4.434782608695652
8125870,5,B000FS2WKI,Dr. Leonard Horowitz is a Harvard graduate who is likely more intelligent than I or anyone who posted a comment regarding his documentary. No offense to those of you who have a doctorate from Harvard.  The proofs Horowitz offers to back up his claims seem irrefutable.,1512259200,2,268,4.826086956521739
