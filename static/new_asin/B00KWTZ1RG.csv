Wasn't a different movie like other reviews had said and I didn't have to go through a weird process to get to it. I played it in my blu ray player via ps4.

When my product arrived, I promptly unwrapped it and put it in my player.  Honestly, I still wasn't expecting it to work, since it was an import, but it did.  Very cool!

I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, so it was great being able to watch it now with my two and a half year-old.  Thanks! ",1498521600,,518,4.019607843137255

6452790,5,B00KWTZ1RG,"First of all, I live in the United States, and this Blu-ray works fine with our players.  I used it in a Samsung player as well as my Xbox One and it played well.  There is no difference in quality since it is a licensed release.  I purchased this UK version because it has been so long since there has been a release in the US and getting the previous release costs upwards of $50.  I love The Lion King, but not enough to pay $50 for one Blu-ray.  This is a great opportunity to get the movie at a reasonable price and dodging Disney's ridiculous release policy and prices is always a good thing.",1492646400,18,598,4.165217391304348

6452794,4,B00KWTZ1RG,The all region bluray disc played well on a VIZIO BD Player for Region 1. The disc does have English subtitles option. There are a few extras which are not all that impressive. The video quality was vivid and sharp. The audio quality was crisp and clear. The movie is a classic story fit for pre-teens. There is cartoon violence but nothing gory. The story ends wth the presentation of a new beginning. This is the only Lion King movie produced by Disney worth collecting.,1491436800,,472,4.564705882352941

6452798,3,B00KWTZ1RG,I was a little upset when I received this because most blu rays come with a DVD and digital copy but this was just the blu ray and it didn't disclose that on the page. I don't have any way to watch blu ray so it was a waste of money on my part. but its in great shape so if you have a play station or blu ray player then this is a good buy,1489968000,,339,3.473684210526316

It came in perfect condition, with the seal intact. I assumed there would be a digital code, but there was none. I didn't mind too much though. It worked on my Sony Blu-Ray as expected since it is region-free and can be played anywhere. Note that it only works on Blu-Ray players and not regular DVD players. It played perfectly. The disc design was that of the Platinum release cover, which looks very nice. It comes only with the one Blu-Ray disc and the box it's in, so there is no regular DVD in it. Overall, I am so glad that I finally have this movie in my household!",1484524800,,715,4.188405797101449

This release of this movie is of great quality, the Blueray disc allows you to watch the movie in 5 different languages, and even offers bonus scenes not in the original.

It is amazing to see the ""circle of life"" in my own life as my 2-1/2 year old is sitting in his room watching this as I type. Two thumbs-up!

So when we moved into the age of DVDs and Blu-Rays and my VHS was no longer around, I decided to hunt down that childhood favorite. Unfortunately Disney has made this rather difficult as they take old classics like this out of stores it seems. Order them online can even be expensive. So finding this UK Import was awesome! It was about as much as any other Blu-Ray in stores now and the shipping was fast! I was not expecting the delivery to be so quick! My experience with over seas and out of country orders has always been weeks to a month or longer to get my order! I got this a day early and  only after a few days from my order! It was almost a week and it arrived, EARLY! So I was very impressed and would order from this group again!

If its being sold by a decent business then it shouldn't have snot on it. NOT COOL.

6453111,4,B00KWTZ1RG,"Here  is  one  of  Disney's  most  popular  movies  to  ever  hit  the  movie  theaters.  For  children  &  Adults.
Music  is  spectacular.  African  music  is  good,  &  of  course  Simba, Nala, Mufasa, Scar  &  Timon  &  Pumba
all  look  okay.  Simba  is  destined  to  take  his  fathers  place  as  king  when  Mufasa  is  gone.  &  couldn't  be  more  overwhelmed  about  becoming  king.  He's  so  excited  he  can't  control  himself.  He's  hopping  around  all  over  the  place.  Simba  &  his  best  friend  Nala  share  adventures  as  cubs.  Go  to  an  elephant  graveyard  after  ditching  Zazu.  That  song  (I just can't wait to be king)  Simba  was  having  the  time  of  his  life.  Annoying  Zazu.  All  the  animals  piled  up  on  top  of  each  other,  it  looked  like  a  circus  act  or  something,  or  one  of  those  rides  you  see  at  the  carnival.
But  evil  lurks  closely  by,  &  unknowingly  Scar  is  watching  Simba  very  carefully.
He  is  Jealous  or  Envy  whatever  you  want  to  call  it,  &  will  do  absolutely  anything  to  make  sure  Simba  doesn't  get  his  position  as  King!
I  like  the  3  Hyenas  the  best,  some  of  my  favorite  characters  in  the  movie,  Shenzi  Banze  &  Ed.
They  show  up  &  threaten  Simba  &  Nala,  what  I  thought  was  so  funny  Zazu  being  nervous  or  whatever,
That  was  funny  to  me.
He  gets  away  &  finds  Mufasa,  who  soon  shows  up  by  surprising  the  Hyenas.
&  he  has  one  heart  to  heart  talk  with  his  son  Simba,  (being  brave  doesn't  mean  you  go  looking  for  trouble)  Its  obvious  Simba  is  feeling  up  to  his  position  as  king,  &  willing  to  do  anything  to  show  he's  got  what  it  takes.  Scar  &  the  Hyenas  plot  a  plan  to  overthrow  Mufasa  &  takeover.
The  Hyenas  start  a  stampede  with  Simba  in  the  gorge.  Simba  hangs  on  for  dear  life.  Mufasa  rescues  Simba  & gets  him  to  safety.  But  almost  gets  trampled  before  leaping  &  climbing  up  the  canyon  wall,  But it  is  too  weak  to  make  it  all  the  way.  &  pleads, Scar  help  me?!  Scar  throws  him  off.
Simba  is  horrified  to  find  his  motionless  father.
&  cries  for  help.
Soon  Scar  arrives  &  blames  Simba  for  his  fathers  death.  He  tells  him  to  runaway  &  never  return.
He  sick's  the  Hyenas  on  him,  however  Simba  gets  away  &  runs  out  into  the  wasteland,  &  keeps  going  for  about  2  or  3  days  before  Timon  &  Pumba  find  him.
&  they  teach  him  about  how  to  live  a  good  life.  No  rules  No  responsibilities.
Timon  &  Pumba  live  in  a  beautiful  jungle,  where  there  are  waterfalls,
they  eat  bugs.  Well?  That's  not  my  kind  of  food  either.  But  when  Simba  grows  into  an  adult  Nala  finds  him,  then  Rafiki  the  wise  monkey  who  was  a  good  friend  of  Mufasa's  &  held  Simba  up  high  for  everyone  to  see  when  he  was  an  infant.
Nala  didn't  get  through  to  Simba,  but  Rafiki  did,  &  managed  to  convince  him  to  go  back,  After
Mufasa's  spirit  appeared  in  front  of  Simba,  Simba  doubted  himself  for  a  second,  How  can  I  go  back?  I'm  not  who  I  use  to  be.  Remember  who  you  are  Mufasa  says,  You  are  my  son,  &  the  one  true  king.
Meanwhile  back  at  pride  rock  everybody's  tired  of  Scar,  he  had  lied  to  the  Hyenas,  said  stick  with  me  &  you'll  never  go  hungry  again.  But  they  did.
Simba  arrived  &  looked  out  across  the  pride  lands  Mufasa's  territory.  There  was  no  grass  for  the  antelope  or  wildebeest  to  graze  on.  Simba  does  have  his  victory  over  Scar,  &  gets  him  backed  into  a  corner,  when  he  said  to  him,  why  should  I  believe  you?!  Everything  you  ever  told  me  was  a  lie,  &  forced  Scar  into  confessing  that  he  really  killed  Mufasa.  The  Hyenas  also  turn  on  Scar  when  he  said  it  was  their  idea.
&  they're  the  ones  who  finish  Scar  off  after  Simba  does  the  majority  of  it.
Rainclouds  come  &  soon  the  grass  gets  green  again.
&  Simba  &  Nala  have  a  cub  of  their  own,  it  was  really  a  boy,  when  they  did  Lion King 2 Simba's  pride,  they  decided  to  change  that.  To  me  it  makes  sense.  Theirs  nothing  a  boy  can  do  that  a  girl  can't!",1432857600,,4372,4.180672268907563

6453115,5,B00KWTZ1RG,"Pretty much the king of the '90s Disney resurgence, and a great example of the studio's strengths. It's a very familiar story - basically Hamlet with singing animals - but they really make it their own through charm, whimsey and simple, effective characterization. The animation is excellent, too, silky smooth and grounded in reality but also expressive, colorful and often downright stunning. Musicals aren't usually my thing, though, and once or twice it felt like the tunes were being crammed into a scene when they really weren't necessary. Still, it's a vibrant, attention-demanding classic that held my kids' hearts from start to finish and authentically embraces an under-appreciated culture. Deservedly one of animation's upper tier titles, it was really cool to share it with a new generation.",1430697600,,803,5.330708661417323
