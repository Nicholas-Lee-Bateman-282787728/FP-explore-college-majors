5836118,4,B00DNJ99F2,"As the tour manager for The Allman Brothers Band from 1970-1976 I was asked to be a part of this film. I was privileged to be Duane Allman's friend and sometimes roomie on the road. This film is extremely well done and captures the spirit, talent and vitality of Duane Allman......a great artist and a great human being. You may
wish to check out my book ""No Saints, No Saviors-My Years With The Allman Brothers Band"" available at Amazon.",1378771200,20,438,4.556962025316456
5836119,4,B00DNJ99F2,"This film about Duane was good but lacked a lot of concert shots.  Good information about the start of his career and comments by former Hour Glass band musicians and producers was good but I wonder-=-why not any comments from the Allman Brothers band musicians?  Dickey Betts, Butch Trucks,and especially from his brother Greg.  Greg' book which came out last year tells a lot of his brother Duane and growing up with him.  I hope that another film comes out about Duane and includes memembers of the band-- I think it would be more beneficial.  Don't get me wrong-I love this film but it should have included the band interviews. and more concert shots.  Greg should play a bigger part in this film. I know the band did not give its approval of the film so another one is warranted---hope it will be made.  I saw the Allman Brothers band with Duane at least 6 times at the Fillmore SF and more needs to be said of this great musician!!!",1378598400,,938,4.482352941176471
5836120,4,B00DNJ99F2,"I usually buy anything (recording, book or video) that offers Duane as it's primary subject matter before the reviews start because I am firm in my admiration for this man and his music, and it is worth risking my dough on what may turn out to be an inferior product from questionable sources.
Having said that I recommend this DVD to Duane fans new and old . Although there is nothing really new offered here to the initiated Allman Bros./Duane freak like myself, this is still for the most part a very enjoyable viewing experience . Many heartfelt interviews and anecdotes told by insiders from the Duane era (surviving Allman Bros. Band members and roadies excepted, hopefully these folks are planning their own project that I will buy the instant it is released).
The moving picture quality is first rate including archival footage that has never looked better. It is said that much more quality footage exists of the original band in concert and we all hope that it finds it's way to the market as soon as possible, but hey.... this is a historical account of Duane and the early days of the band and not a concert document.
Thanks to the people who took the time and made the effort to honor this man and his band with this long overdue remembrance. Anything about Duane is welcome to all longtime fans...but here comes the criticism....who decided to take all of the still photos shown in this film and destroy them by processing them with some kind of Zelig/Keystone Kops scratch lines, dirt, and hairs to make them look like they were pulled out of a trash can....moving pictures I can understand the technique, but these are still photos and are available in pristine condition ( I have collected Duane pictures in concert, childhood, candid, and posed,  for a decade....they are all on my screen saver every day and they all look great for the most part) Sorry to be so critical but it's a review and this just bothered me to the point of distraction.

Again, I look forward to buying any material that is forthcoming, especially Duane's daughter's book.... link:

Please pre-order this book in support of a dutiful daughter who could have long ago cashed in his guitar for millions but instead loaned it to the R&R Hall of Fame for all of us to enjoy and continues to lovingly support his legacy ( I do not personally know her unfortunately)...Thanks Galladrielle!",1378598400,15,2552,5.011792452830188
5836121,5,B00DNJ99F2,"If you're a fan of Duane Allman and the Allman Brothers, ""Song Of The South""is a revelation for several reasons-for years we've been listening to Duane's recordings, and we get to hear from the people who actually recorded him. We're also treated to plenty of never before seen photos and parts of a 1970 interview from the man himself.

This film covers Duane's career from he and his brother Gregg's band the Escorts, and particular attention is paid to his studio work before and during his time with the Allman Brothers Band. Muscle Shoals guitarist Jimmy Johnson is given ample face time, recalling Duane's lead guitar work on Wilson Pickett's version of ""Hey, Jude"". This was the recording that caught the attention of so many industry heavyweights, securing his stock early in his career. Musicians Paul Hornsby and Pete Carr, respected musicians themselves discuss Duane's growth during this time, and they're still in awe over forty years later.

Narrator Thomas Arnold points out that right around the time rock was feeling the influence of country and R&B, the Allman Brothers appear with their blend of Blues, Rock, R&B and progressive country, due mainly to fellow guitarist Dickie Betts. The meeting of Duane and Eric Clapton is the high point in the film. Footage of Albert King playing ""As The Years Go Passing By"" shows how his melody influenced the seven note intro to ""Layla"".

Two authors contribute to the film: Randy Poe (""Skydog"") and Scott Freeman (""Midnight Riders"") are both astute writers who discuss how Duane led the Brothers onstage counting on musicianship alone to move the audience-no ""shaking of asses"" or worrying about fashion. Freeman makes the point that the Brothers' third album, the live ""Fillmore East"" was the real breakthrough for the band. Most groups would not release a DOUBLE live album for only their third offering, but the Allmans' reputation for superior musicianship earned them their first gold record.

Some very rare archival footage shows the band in concert; especially intriguing is watching the band in full flight during Duane's solo toward the end of ""Mountain Jam"". You have to wonder: just how much video has been stored over the years, and will any of it ever be available to the public?

The most interesting stories were told by  recording engineers the Albert brothers, Ron and Howard. Ron tells how the production team would often sit with the band after a take, and with the tape rolling, catch those impromptu moments when the band, not knowing they were being recorded would often put down some gold.

Extras on the DVD include recording history  for some of the landmark albums as told by the Alberts. There is also a list of the  contributors to this film including Willie Perkins, Carr, Hornsby and many others. These are the people who  played, recorded or traveled with Duane and some are still active today. Perkins has written a memoir about his time with the Brothers ""No Saints, No Saviors"".

Written and directed by Tom O'Dell, ""Song Of The South"" is a perfect companion piece to the ""Skydog Retrospective"", or if you're new to Duane, this DVD is a good place to start. Next spring, Galadrielle Allman will release a book about the father who passed when she was only two. All of these projects keep Duane's spirit alive-and that makes them all worth wile.",1378166400,124,3338,4.911190053285968

Never the less...I gave it as a gift to many fans because you will learn a lot about Duane that you never knew....I just wish the format was better, the people doing interviews were more compelling, and that they had played a few songs from beginning to end instead of just meaningless tiny clips of songs.",1451347200,2,608,4.638888888888889

5836205,5,B00DNJ99F2,"I became a Duane Allman fan at age thirteen... during the same year that he died. He had a huge influence on my guitar playing, as he did for many persons my age. I still listen to his recordings on a regular basis. I will always be indebted to him and I will always be saddened by the inherent unfairness of his death.

This is an outstanding documentary, produced to very high journalistic standards. It is not an emotional, ""fanboy"" type video. Instead, it is presented systematically and thoroughly like a PBS documentary.

Many of the people who lived or worked with Duane, including childhood friends, were interviewed. I was especially pleased with the extensive contributions of the Allman Brothers Band road manager and the engineers from Criteria Studios (who recorded Revival, Layla and Eat a Peach). I learned a huge amount about Layla (my all-time favorite album) and the synergy between Duane and Eric Clapton... perhaps the best pairing of guitarists in rock music history.

I do regret that no ABB members were interviewed. Although I do not know for sure, I'm guessing that somebody wanted money or other considerations that the producers would not (or could not) meet. I would have especially been interested in hearing the perspective of Dickey Betts, Linda Oakley and Duane's family members. However, the quality of the project does not suffer in their absence.

From a technical perspective, the camera work and audio quality are outstanding. There are no flashy special effects (other than a few psychedelic film clips from the 1960's) ... just 2+ hours of well-organized content.

If you are a music lover of any sort, you will be impressed by this video. If you're a southern rock guitarist like me, you will find this documentary to be indispensable. I give it my highest recommendation.",1404259200,2,1812,4.947368421052632

5836212,5,B00DNJ99F2,"This is a professionally made documentary over 2 hours long covering the musical life and career of Duane Allman, the musical industry of the times, and the early bands that proceeded the Allman Brothers Band.  It was interesting to see that Duane had so much session work before and during his ABB days.  This video can send you in other directions if you are a ABB collector.  Modern band members were not involved in creating the video which is a weak spot, but contracts may have limited that.  Many other people in the music industry associated with Duane and the ABB were recorded live contributing to the video.  There are some early music recordings pieces that are played but not much early video.  Instead, old photos are mostly shown as people talked in the background about what was being shown. The video ends about where today's modern ABB begins.  Overall I found this documentary entertaining and worth the purchase.  I'd recommend it to any ABB fan.

There's some splendid old footage of the band and it's cool to hear some snippets of some of the interviews with the man himself.
Conspicuous by its absence, though, is any input or commentary from the surviving members of the ABB. Still, it is a very fine documentary about the great Duane Allman, and should be of great interest to fans of the Allmans in general, and of Duane in particular.",1393286400,,569,4.533980582524272

My regard for him as a musician and guitarist has only increased, and I thought the world of him before watching this. It does a very good job of painting a picture of him, as any well written biography would do. Most of the disc are interviews with members of the Allman's inner circle, starting with their high school days. Some of these folks have many accomplishments in their own right -- Muscle Shoals session players, for example. Hearing virtually everyone talk about what a musician and presence he was, in their own words, is very moving and very telling. Time and money well spent.",1392336000,4,802,4.5

This is not a product sanctioned by Gregg or anyone in the ABB family, (it was produced in England) but it features some pretty cool first hand accounts of their beginnings as they moved from their time as fledgling musicians in both Florida, and later with the Allman Joys and The Hour Glass in Los Angeles. There are no performances and I would only recommend it truthfully to die hard fans of the group (fortunately, I happen to be one!) and particularly those of Duane as he is always the figure who continues to inspire (justifiably so).the admiration of fans and those who knew him.

I have read the books, but a video presentation makes it all a bit more real.  Very much worth while to see how it all happened, who was involved and the parts they all played.

Willie Perkins, who I met at Capricorn in 1974, is interviewed extensively.  Read his book as well.  Some of the other folks were close (Hornsby) while some were journalists (Freeman) who the ABB discredit.
In either case, there is not much out there and this was an interesting purchase.  It is historical in nature and positive.  DA was brilliant, no doubt.  He brought out the best of those around him.  He also clearly abused his body which this DVD glosses over.  Too bad there was no Tom Dowd interviews (he may have passed and he has his own DVD on the ABB out).

5836243,1,B00DNJ99F2,"Don't get your hopes up. Compared to the Eagles' wonderful informative documentary, this one was sadly lacking. I watched this one time and literally threw it in the trash. If you are an Allman Brothers fan and have read any history of them whatsoever, then this DVD is basically more(or less)of the same. It was not authorized by The Allman Brothers. No interviews with Gregg, Dickie, Butch, or Jaimoe. It, of course, HAS to bring up the subject of racial bigotry in the horrible ""redneck south"". I'm 58 years old, I grew up in the south(Nashville, TN), went to school with blacks in the 60's and 70's and never saw ANY of the horrible bigotry that this ""documentary"" describes. As a matter of fact, the blacks were the most popular and well-liked kids in the school, so enough with the stereotypes already.
  There's nothing about Duane Allman on this dvd that you haven't heard ten dozen times. I was hoping it would be a documentary about Duane; what he liked to do, what he liked to eat, information about his guitar rigs, maybe some personal stories from Gregg, maybe some interesting stories from Dickie about his years on stage next to Duane. Nope none of that. Nothing intimate or personal from those who knew him and lived with him. The only insider interviewed on this generic, long, drawn out documentary was Willie Perkins, the band's one time accountant and road manager. Sadly, the best part wasn't even included in the main fiasco but was in the special features when someone asked Willie Perkins some questions about Duane. I gave it a double thumbs down and sent it to the city dump.",1385769600,24,1601,4.693950177935943

It is a well produced documentary however that does include some fragments of original Allman Brothers songs and some footage of the Allman Brothers in the 1970s, including a show at The Fillmore.
The use of effects on the images do annoy me, trying to look old and scratchy etc and using pops and scratches on Duane's voice from an interview is a bit silly.

Still, the best period for me was when Duane was alive and I would give anything to get some complete concert footage from that era. Please email me at poundpup@bigpond.com if you can assist.

I was extremely excited when this DVD popped up on my radar, hoping for new information, significant live footage and in-depth interviews. The live footage is minimal and the information is largely available in Poe and Freeman's books. The interviews are OK, including bandmates from early bands and their road manager at the time of Duane's passing. The majority of the documentary is supported by still photos that are mostly available elsewhere. Would I still buy it after having seen it ? Probably, just for the fact that there is nothing else out there on Duane.

5836257,5,B00DNJ99F2,"For the brief moment in time that they occupied as the incarnation of the band this film represents, The Allman Brothers Band were/are the main thing I look for in music; a group of musicians that exists solely to play. No costumes, no spotlight, no BS, no motives beyond showing me (as a non-musician) what they have that I'll never have and making my world a better place because of it. ""Song Of The South: Duane Allman And The Rise Of The Allman Brothers"" is not a definitive documentation of the band per se as for reasons I am unaware of, the surviving members of the band itself did not participate. Under normal circumstances that would be a major problem but ANYTHING that helps bring to the world the genius that was Duane Allman is a welcome addition in my book.

The film traces the history of Duane (and Gregg) from his childhood up to his tragic death, using interviews with friends from that period to great effect, adding commentary and interviews from journalists, former Hour Glass members, the Albert Brothers, studio musicians he played with (David Hood stands out with some anecdotal stories that absolutely cracked me up and Paul Hornsby is delightful) and especially Willie Perkins. Sadly, there's only a few short pieces of concert footage (most, if not all, available for viewing on UTube) and curiously there are no interviews with, or statements by, notable masters of the instrument but even with the shortcomings I can't think of any reason why any Duane Allman fan would not be happy to have this in his collection.

I never got to see the Beatles, the Stones or a number of major bands from that period and I've always been fine with that. Not having been able to see this version of the band however is a disappointment I'll take to the grave with me. I can't think of another guitarist who's playing brings me to tears.

5836261,4,B00DNJ99F2,"Let me start off by saying that in my book any Duane is good Duane. This DVD as its name suggests is not truly a Duane biography (though that is the bulk of what is covered) - it is more about the time and conditions that gave rise to so-called Southern-Rock. The best contribution of this DVD are the live interviews with Duane's contemporaries.  There is very little on the musical or actual video footage of Duane that is new or revealing to long-time fans.  My gripe is that the areas where they should have gone into more depth were kind of glossed over.  For example, more time should have been spent on Taj Mahal and showing what Duane saw that just totally influenced him to delve into slide.  Sadly, there are many that would have been a gas to have interviewed like Tom Dowd but unfortunately are no longer with us.

So yes it is a good intro to the subject or even a nice adjunct to the collection for any serious ABB fan.  However it does not go into the subject matter with alot of depth.  For that I would recommend getting a copy of Skydog to fill in the gaps.",1379030400,2,1075,4.266009852216749
5836262,5,B00DNJ99F2,"Even if haven't read all the books, own the the music, shared copies with traders and own your own Coridicin bottle, you'll enjoy this fine historical retrospective. Sure, you'll learn a lot about Duane (the bonus Q&A with road manager Willie Perkins is incredibly candid). But you'll also get context and historical perspective about growing up in the South in the early '60s and glimpses at influences like John Coltrane and Albert King. And if you're a fanatic like me, you'll enjoy this DVD even more.

Long live the spirit of Brother Duane Allman. Thanks to all involved for putting together this tribute.",1378857600,10,610,4.922330097087379

8594981,5,B00DNJ99F2,"Great! It seems quite comprehensive. It includes Duane's childhood, first bands and his work as a session player before forming the Allman Brothers. In comparison to many other DVDs about musicians this is much more complete. I watched this last week and I'm going to watch it again tonight",1504742400,,290,4.938775510204081
8594982,3,B00DNJ99F2,"I'm an ABB fan especially the Duane Allman era. And wonder where they would've gone had he lived This is a good video I wish there was more footage of the Bro's  w/Duane it's more of a documentary w/interviews from former band mates and journalists It's unauthorized so there are no interviews w/any of the ABB, so you don't get their stories If your a Duane fan it's worth viewing",1499558400,,381,4.442857142857143
8594983,5,B00DNJ99F2,"Watched this yesterday as a tribute to Greg Allman on the day of his passing. As a long-time Allman Brothers fan, I thought this would entertaining, but I wasn't prepared to learn as much as I did about the band's origins. Great, great information about the genesis of the Southern Rock movement and what it meant to music fans, especially those coming of age in the late 60's and early 70's. Highly recommended.",1495929600,,412,4.657534246575342
8594984,5,B00DNJ99F2,"Excellent ! And so good to hear Skydog talking. For any ABB fan, especially a Duane fan, this is a must!
You can't however put any other Southern band in the same category. Duane Allman was in his own category",1491004800,,209,4.25
8594985,5,B00DNJ99F2,"This is a must have for ANYONE who appreciates the great music of South and the birth of it via the Allman Brothers. This is an incredibly well done documentary..... It's Excellent.

So..... I finally got a chance to see ""Song Of The South"". A wonderful testimonial and archival footage of the early days from the Daytona Beach days to the world wide stage.

Curiously very few bandmates and no family were included. However, I learned a great deal more than I knew before. Like ""Little Martha"" was not only posthumously released with ""Eat A Peach"" (1972) but it was the only song written by Duane. He was also an avid reader and evidently loved  suspense novels like Sherlock Holmes, admired and respected Eric Clapton and vice versa!

You know all we have are these testimonials, footage, interviews and OMG The Music. It's the closest thing we'll have to know, remember and honor his legendary life.

Thank heavens there are folks who keep the memory and honor of Duane alive for those of us who can appreciate Duane's greatness as we get to know him better..... and the whole band and entourage intact in their stories and in their personal memories and above all those who took the time to share them.

Hearing the radio interviews with Duane was sweet as I listened for a heavy Southern Drawl.... there was none to really speak of. But his thought processes and inflection and command of the language was a nice window to who he was.

Duane was not only brilliant but was quite charismatic.....",1489795200,2,1500,4.680608365019012
