8049964,5,B0007P0XO6,This is a TRUE story of a woman dealing with the reality of AIDS that she contracted from a one night encounter when she was ONLY 15/16 years old. This is a good movie to share with your children who are in their teenage years. So many people concentrate on NOT getting pregnant and fail to understand that they also have a very high chance of getting diseases. What a wake up call to this young lady and understand that this is right when AIDS was just becoming known. Although there is alot more known about this disease it is still nothing you want on your resume.,1204243200,,567,4.308411214953271
