5598722,4,B00BEJL69U,"In what is perhaps the best comedy of the year, Seth Rogen, with Evan Goldberg tries his hand at directing.  Both wrote the screenplay as well but I suspect much of the film was outlined and the comedic actors improvised along the way.  This is a twisted, profane and gross take on the Apocalypse as you will ever see.

The cast all play versions of themselves and everything begins at a party at James Franco's brand new house.  Every Gen-X comedic actor is there and the sniping and back-stabbing begins early on.  When what is believed to be an earthquake rocks the house, the majority of the celebs (Michael Cera, Mindy Kaling, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Martin Starr, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari and oh yeah Rhianna) meet their demise falling into a giant pit of fire.

The survivors (Franco, Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson and Jonah Hill) retreat back into Franco's still standing house.  After seeing people streamed to heaven encased in a blue beam of light as well as devilish monsters breathing fire, the guys conclude it is indeed the Biblical Rapture.

Rogen and Goldberg take turns making fun of the various characters including movie bombs.  ""The Green Hornet"" anyone?  Be forewarned, the film has a non-stop barrage of jokes and gags involving sex, stereotypes, body parts, body functions, blasphemy, necrophilia, severed body parts and other stuff I can't remember.  And it's all funny as hell.",1371081600,4,1425,4.970464135021097
5598723,5,B00BEJL69U,"This movie was hilarious from start to finish. I loved it. The actors were incredible, the graphics were incredible and it was flat-out amazing.",1370995200,4,144,5.041666666666667
5598724,4,B00BEJL69U,"With the amount of talent this has lined up, it would be strange if it was not a good time at the movies. Based on a short film called Jay & Seth vs. the Apocalypse, this movie ups the ante in every sense of the word. The comedy you have come to expect from Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, James Franco, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride is top notch. The rest of the cast, all playing themselves, is also played perfectly. Injected with horror in fact, some right out of famous horror films like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, this movie also brings the scares and gore, although it never loses sight that it is a comedy, first and foremost.

When Jay comes to LA to party with Seth, they end up hitting a party at James Franco's new, druglord-type mansion. All the celebrities are there: the main cast of 6 mentioned above, Michael Cera, Rihanna, and others that I won't spoil the cameos for. Then, it comes to a crashing halt when the party is stopped by the oncoming End of Days. Death and destruction leave the 6 leads trapped in James' house, with very little but themselves to entertain each other and survive. Comedy ensues in every form, from spoofing themselves in nearly every movie they've been in, to the explicit vulgarity we have come to love in their films like Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, and so on, but kicked up a few notches. Everyone gets a chance to shine too, which is great, because they all give 110%, and the movie is all the better for it. The horror is in top form too. It is surprising how easy it just comes to the screen in such a raunchy comedy with these recognizable faces, but that is part of what makes the movie so enjoyable.

You will laugh at nearly everything that this film throws at you, even if you feel you shouldn't be laughing at, such as exorcism and drinking urine. I expected this movie to be funny, but not near as funny as it turned out to be. Not only did Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen write this, they also directed it. Keep them in mind, because they will be getting much more to do when this movies hits hard. I expect this to be one that we talk about for years to come, and has set the bar high in the world of comedy.",1370736000,130,2196,4.327669902912621
5598725,4,B00BEJL69U,"""Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride all play exaggerated versions of themselves in this zany and very acid-trip like comedy about the emergence of a Book of Revelations-like apocalypse coming to Los Angeles.

As part of a free test screening in selected British cinemas, coming into this film without much expectation or notice, the film does not disappoint and makes you laugh even harder and scratch your head when you are not expecting the unexpected. Much of the humour in it is especially relatable since I got most of the pop culture references and iconic points about Los Angeles (the Carl's Jr. in the beginning that is near the strip club and LAX). The film, as a whole, is hilarious and absurd in many ways and because of its multiple styles of comedy used (screwball, sex/blue humour, dark/black humour, religious satire), it would be a little difficult to pidgeon-hole.

Thankfully, after years of the same-old comedies (*cough, Hangover, * cough), here is something (along with 2012's The Watch), that manages to create something bizarre and random like a Monty Python skit but longer, funnier, and much more fun (when many of Hollywood's famous and most recent comedians star and come to shine and dive here). Without spoiling too much but watching Aziz Ansari and Kevin Hart in the same scene and Seth Rogen celebrating and drinking fancily with water were some very hilarious moments that are not likely to be forgotten from this point on.

This is the End, in all its wild, stoner glory, serves as a much better and more interesting take on the kind of 2012 paranoia than the Steve Carrell/Keira Knightley dramedy Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. Soon, we will have to see how Simon Pegg and Nick Frost kick it off with The World's End.""",1370390400,2,1815,4.829581993569132

5598945,1,B00BEJL69U,"Seriously, these are all the reasons I don't care for Seth Rogen's ""acting""  all in one movie. Yes, it's one of his older movies but he really hasn't grown as an actor in any of his recent films. Honestly, the whole collection of actors in this movie are of the same caliber. If you're prepubescent you'll find this stuff to be gold. Lots of creepy references about sex and bodily functions to keep a twelve year old mind stimulated.  The visual effects had more to offer than the acting. This is one those movies I forgot about when it came out, I saw it offered on Prime so I figured I'd watch it. Yikes, I was better off forgetting about it. The title relates more to the acting careers of the cast.",1524441600,,702,4.3106060606060606

Irreverent but not disrespectful. You may be the type who doesn't appreciate Hollywood actors making fun of themselves, seemingly for their own amusement, but this is done to perfection. I'm generally snobby and not easy to please. I wasn't hoping for much out of Danny McBride after having been made to watch a few episodes of ""Eastbound and Down,"" but he and the whole cast were killer. Should be a cult classic if it isn't already. Self-deprecating humor is taken to a new level.

Several of the bits were grossly sophomoric, yep, and didn't like  them, but they pass quickly and the next bit doesn't deserve fast forwarding.  Great pacing.  The writing was the weakest part, and some of the acting was off, yep....... And, bottom line, I just now bought it instead of renting.  There's my true review.

5599844,4,B00BEJL69U,"You will not like this movie if: 1) you are expecting a horror film - this is much more like ""Shaun of the Dead""; 2) you find blasphemy offensive; 3) you have a low vulgarity threshold; 4) you do not have a decent knowledge of pop culture; 5) you do not know who these celebrities are; 6) you do not like neurotic humor.  That said, there are few things more enjoyable than watching celebrities mock themselves and the images they present to the public - and given that this is a survivalist fiasco, the performances are deservedly over-the-top, with hilarious results (Michael Cera's brutal, against-type character is one of the most memorable I've ever seen).  The pace of the film seldom lags as the actors find bizarre ways to undermine each other while the world outside goes to hell.  (One may ask whether the real hell is outside or closer to home.)  The movie does seem to introduce a certain milky morality at the end, which blunts some of the otherwise razor-sharp impact.  But the film does stand well on its merits, those being the caustic, ironic and absurd comedic qualities of the cast itself.",1485129600,8,1108,4.661538461538462

At least this wasn't as terrible as Sausage Party which was a thousand times worse.

It is very over the top and whacky but anyone who is a fan of James Franco, Seth Rogan, Danny McBride, and all the other hilarious actors in this movie, will love it.

5601433,1,B00BEJL69U,"Garbage. It tries to be funny and besides a few moments it really isn't. I have heard people try to defend it mostly teenagers whom I know use heroin among other things and have been caught using date rape drugs on younger teens(yes they were arrested and got a slap on the wrist it was in ABQ, NM a few months after the release). I have only met one adult who claimed to enjoy the movie he also popped for cocaine on a UA(this really happened he seemed like a nice guy he had just moved from Oklahoma, he had also served in the military for a bit over 8 years). Every other person I have asked thought it was terrible. If they liked it I challenged them to re watch it sober, they fell asleep, then the ""I quess I was drunk when I watched it"" part comes out. I had to try and watch this twice I fell asleep the first time my wife did too. The only other movies I have fallen asleep to were ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chung Lee"", ""The Croods""(my kids at least liked that movie), ""Sherlock Holmes""(I was drunk). Dont waste your time with this I would rather watch the Fantastic 4 reboot that just came out. The best part of this movie for me was Rhianha getting killed, since I cannot stand her or her music.

The movie starts off with some product placement, followed by attending a party in wich all the funny parts in the commercials pop up allmost everyone dies. Then a group of survivors get stuck in a mansion trying to survive when the whole world has turned into a literal hell on earth. Things happen disagreements occur people get kicked out or leave said mansion.  Supplies run out and the survivors are forced to leave. Then the movie gets to be extremely offensive and anyone with a weak stomach should stop watching as the film tries to be ultra realistic and as offensive as possible. This is also where I lost any respect I had for Channing Tatum and Seth Roggen lost whatever little respect I had left for him.

Dont whatch, please stop saying certain people don't get it and ""You don't think its funny because you do not understand the type of humor it is"". Lastly the allways annoying ""Its stoner humor you don't understand it"", ""Pineapple Express"" was stoner humor and I have yet to meet anyone who did not like it. Humor is allmost universal if it is funny you do not have to explain the joke. Again this movie has a few good moments but overall the rest of the film is attrocious. Just watch a compilation of the best moments of the movie. I wasted so much time and energy trying to watch this film don't do the same. If I could get my money back I would. It should be a crime that this film had a release. Do yourself a favor and watch Pineapple Express or The Interview two actually good movies.",1451088000,,2722,4.291828793774319

5601525,5,B00BEJL69U,"Most of Seth Rogen's & Evan Goldberg's filmography can be some very solid stuff, but this time around they've gotten the director's chair, giving them more creative control. As a result, ""This Is The End"" not only passes being a good comedy, but a good MOVIE as well. Brandon Trost's cinematography is great and the dialogue between the actors can be noticeably ad-libbed, but it feels very genuine since just about everyone turns in a brilliant performance. This was the first mainstream movie that portrayed actors as, well, normal people. They're imperfect and don't always have an answer to everything, it helps them become much more relatable as people. Some of them play exaggerated versions of themselves that's very fun to watch and it's pretty obvious that they're having a blast doing so.

5601754,1,B00BEJL69U,"Okay, here's the thing. I am not against sophomoric humor at all. I have been known to enjoy movies such as The Hangover, Hot Tub Time Machine, and the hilarious 21 Jump Street and 22 Jump Street, and even Adam Sandler comedies from the 90's.

However, that being said, I have a burning passionate hatred for Seth Rogen as a comedian. I remember reading an interview with him once that said that when he was a child and he found out that you could be funny for a living, that's all he ever wanted to do.

Having seen a lot of his comedic work (his dramatic work is okay, such as 50/50 and The Guilt Trip and I'm interested to see how he plays Steve Wozniak in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic with Michael Fassbender) I am convinced that Rogen is the greatest liar on the face of the planet for saying that. The truth of the matter is, Rogen doesn't want to be funny for a living, he actually wants to be juvenile for a living, and as far as I'm concerned, that should never be an acceptable career path.

The reason that movies like Hangover, Hot Tub Time Machine, and the like work is because the writers understand that in order to make the comedy funny (as gross-out, penis, and stoner jokes are not funny in and of themselves) is to make your characters likeable and interesting in order to raise the comedy up from being dumb, and you like hanging out with the characters and want to join them for the ride. It seems that in the relatively short career that Rogen has had making comedies, he still fails to grasp that concept and instead decides to be the Michael Bay of gross-out comedy and think that will make everything funny.

Plus, I would like to point out that Rogen is way way out of his depth when trying to make jokes about things like decapitation and rape, as he is clearly not talented enough of a comedian to pull it off. Don't get me wrong, you can indeed make funny jokes out of things like that (George Carlin was famous for doing so) but Rogen, instead of having something interesting to say about that, would rather ""joke"" (and I use that term very loosely) about a guy getting his head cut off and them playing soccer with it, or how who is more likely to rape Emma Watson. (I really wish that Watson would have used that axe she had to kill them for that instead of just smacking the handle of it into Jonah Hill's face).

Plus, lots of wasted opportunity to make humorous observations about the apocalypse and how different cultures and different walks of life interpret such a thing. Now, before you Rogen fanboys with itchy keyboard fingers even attempt to type up and say ""That wasn't the point of this movie!"" yes, I understand that. However, the point I'm trying to make is that that's one of the many reasons that this film does not work as a comedy. Take Simon Pegg's brilliant ending to the Cornetto Trilogy with The World's End. The World's End is what This Is The End should have been.

In a perfect world, Rogen would have had the tar beaten out of him, thrown out of the entertainment industry, and forced to flip burgers at McDonald's for the rest of his life as punishment for making this ""film"", but it's not a perfect world, is it? I mean, I still like James Franco, Jonah Hill, and Craig Robinson, but I wish this is something that they would have said no to.

Rogen, just stop. Please. You're not really that funny. At all.",1443484800,3,3368,4.3792

Jonah Hill and Danny McBride were particularly funny; I actually cried laughing at the possession scene and porn magazine scene. And the ending? I won't spoil it, but as a kid of the 90s I freaking loved it!

The humor in this movie is definitely vulgar, so you might want to pass if that's not your thing. But if you're cool with that, get this movie! I've watched it a few times now and still laugh every time.",1438128000,,708,4.363636363636363

However, just finished 2nd viewing. It's not Oscar nominating material, but still funny. I might even watch it again, though not too soon. Here's why I give some stars. Almost everyone plays themselves. They mock themselves, their lifestyles, or at least, their perceived lifestyles. They mock their own ineptness amidst the destruction of the earth. They mock their self-indulgence. It's our fun at the expense of the celebrities involved.
Watch for the numerous cameos of familiar faces, including the parties at the beginning and the end. When I say they mock the Bible, its partly a mocking of their own quickly scanned mis-understanding of the apocalypse (part of the plot). They definitely do mock the concept of heaven, however.
Just consider all of this fair warning, if you decide to watch it. Even while being offended, I still enjoyed it. I consider it a 3 to 3.5 star rating. Since I can't go halvsies, I rounded down. Just cant give it a 4.",1435708800,,1190,5.076530612244898

Who thinks it's ""entertainment"" when heads are blood balls and gore is played for laughs? Sure, write down your Oscar-worthy screenplays when you are blitzed. But, take a week and dry out then look at the crayon scribbles and then become embarrassed and use the notes to light a bonfire and torch all the other lunatic ravings. These Hollywood looks at the insiders are not insightful and as far away from Comedy as you can get. The perspectives are about as broad as a pinhole.  All those stars in a movie and not one thought this was a bad idea for a movie??? If anyone put up their own money for this smoking turd, then they are short on common sense and lighter in the bank account. Does anybody know what ""editing"" is? Cheech and Chong beat you guys a long time ago. Seems like some people have been smoking that Asian Agent Orange weed. I would suggest you guys take some sober and straight road trips and see America this summer. Find out what America is all about. Ask people of all ages what makes them laugh--get a large cross-section sampling. I've worked in restaurants, prisons and mental health institutions. Some of funniest times can be found in the most serious of places. We live in troubled times. Humor is supposed to help get us through the bad times. I recently picked up one of Woody Allen's early works, a book titled, ""Without Feathers"", from 1972. For 50 cents I've found volumes on humor in those 221 pages.  Page 8, ""Thought: Why does man kill? He kills for food. And not only food: frequently there must be a beverage."" Good Humor is priceless and timeless.",1433894400,6,1739,4.482649842271293
5602459,2,B00BEJL69U,"I pretty much have to give this movie 1.5 stars. I don't know if I have a choice. The plot was absurdly stupid and here we have yet another movie that totally banks on being obscene and gross. There are no witty jokes or ironic situations. I wanted to give this movie a higher ranking, but there is nothing in this movie that warrants that. I thought the movie started with a very interesting concept, of 5 real Hollywood actors actually hanging out and playing themselves. I wish it had just stayed on the vibe of them hanging out all night and doing something interesting with that. Instead, this movie took a nosedive and just devolved into a ridiculous movie about the end of the world, although I saw that coming with the title. I kind of wish it was just them digging on each other and the actual, non-paranormal incidents they run into on a daily basis. Their run-in with Emma Watson could have been funny if they stuck to reality, but the ridiculous tone of this movie ruined all of that. It also seemed confined in the fact that the whole movie took place at James Franco's house.

The pretty clearly improved actions in this movie left the page, the plot, and the quality behind. Some of the dialogue (that seemed improved at least to me) took the familiarly bad turn of being over-dramatic, a common mistake in improv. At the end of the day, I just don't think that Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen can really write a script. They just don't really have the chops. There were a few moments at the beginning of this movie that were legitimately funny (in a vague way), but the rest of the movie went off the rails. It just jumped from one absurd scenario to another and seemed like it was just following an 8 year old's urge to tell a ridiculous, disjointed story.

To give credit where credit is due, the whole story with Michael Cera was legitimately funny and super ironic if you are keyed in to his personality.  It was easy to see that the writers were being pretty sarcastic with their portrayal of him. That being the only thing that really worked comedically, I wouldn't say that it was nearly enough to save this film. Neither were the vaguely funny improved scenes throughout. It is a pity, because I know that Jonah Hill is actually hilariously funny in the right movie, but the screenwriters didn't seem to know how to handle him. He is one of the funniest, if not the funniest actor in Hollywood right now, but his potential was wasted here. To see Hill at the top of his game, I wholeheartedly recommend ""21 Jump Street."" That movie was legitimately hilarious. I appreciate that this movie actually seemed to have a positive, pro religious theme, and didn't just wreck on Christianity, but while the message was great, the humor was just not good enough. I give it 1.5 stars.",1433894400,4,2795,4.519762845849803

For me the raunch seemed to take away from the movie and the humor, not eitirely but it just seemed they put some of it in there just to put it in there.

5602842,1,B00BEJL69U,"Let me start by saying that I love the actors in this movie and I really really wanted to laugh.  But it's just so terrible and boring.  The comedy is all based upon the actors-who play themselves-making themselves look stupid by saying stupid things.  It comes across as false modesty and seems like one giant inside party game.  Indeed, the story is set at a Hollywood party that we will never be invited to.  And it basically never leaves that party and walks us through the social dynamics of inter-star friendships and rivalries that are totally unrelatable to us 99 percenters.  During the movie, the group tries to shoot a movie within the movie which is just as boring, stupid, and pointless as the rest of the movie.  Finally some very bad special-effect demons show up to create some actual end-of-the-world conflict.  But it's too late. This is an insult to the fans of some of the most famous comedic actors that says how stupid they think their own fans are.  How do you screw this up?  Great actors, apocolypse, the story should write itself!",1428364800,4,1056,4.65945945945946

Seth Rogen wrote, directed, produced and acting in this piece of garbage.

This is the end result of such a unique, witty idea. A bunch of LA douches who think they're clever in front of the camera for a couple hours. While a few small, select parts and bits of dialogue are funny, the overwhelming majority is a huge mess and about as funny or enjoyable as the worst scenes in Borat. This was so bad that I'm personally boycotting any future movie from the ""actors"" who made this garbage. The movie is Borat meets I'm Still Here meets Sophia Coppola's godawful The Bling Ring (also with Emma Watson!) meets Judd Apatow's humor brought to the level of a dysentery-infested storm drain.

There were several good laughs in the show, like the scene where Emma Watson takes the supplies from six grown men, but mostly they relied on discussions of Michael Cera's private anatomy, arguing about ejaculation on people and objects, and visuals such as giant demon penises being severed.

5603633,4,B00BEJL69U,"Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest ones, that come to you while having a drink with friends at a bar. Unlike this groups other films, the story and plot aren't the focus here. This Is The End features a ton of Hollywood's top comedic stars, playing extremely stereotypical version of themselves. Their characters are based on rumors, gossip, and over exaggerations of their true persona's, resulting in a hilarious film, that not only delighted their fans, but also gave a huge middle finger to the paparazzi. The film starts with Jay Baruchel visiting Seth Rogen in L.A. Baruchel, a notorious introvert, wants to stay in, but Rogen wants to go to James Franco's housewarming party. Reluctantly the pair agree to go to the big time Hollywood shindig, when the fun is interrupted by the apocolypse, and I don't mean a zombie one, the actual end of the world. The pampered actors find themselves in a fight for survival in the home of James Franco. The whole cast was hilarious and while watching it you realize that the characters they develop really aren't that dissimilar from who they really are. Jay Baruchel surprised me, as I knew very little about him, besides his awkward performance in She's Out of League. I haven't really seen him as more than a ancillary character, and it was really fun to see him fit in with the gang. Rogen, Hill, Franco, and Robinson don't disappoint, giving you exactly what you'd expect from them, and unfortunately so does Danny McBride. I really don't get the appeal of this guy! He is way over the top, super annoying, and just a big dumb redneck, that just doesn't seem to fit in with the likes of these comedic geniuses. If I had the choice I'd much rather have had Michael Cera or Paul Rudd trapped with them instead of McBride, who didn't get more than an annoyed grunt out of me. This Is The End is a very funny film, wrapped in an awful story, but it gives great insight into the personalities of some of our favorite actors and that really is the whole point of this film. It's just one of those things that either you'll get it and love it, or you won't.",1409443200,,2106,4.559366754617415

5603658,2,B00BEJL69U,"When I first watched the previews I decided to skip it. After hearing several ""Hollywood Insiders"" discussing how great it turned out, I decided maybe it was worth a watch. Almost, but not quite...

This is the end features a rocking party at James Francos' incredible house. Jay is in town to visit Seth for old times sake. Seth decides they will have a great time at the party, and convinces Jay to go despite his reservations against it. When the guys arrive the party is completely underway. People are dancing, drinking, and having an amazing time. The number of cameos during these scenes was nothing short of amazing. It seemed like they gathered every second rate star and put them in the same location to film this movie.

Midway through the party, all hell breaks loose, literally. The rapture/apocalypse happens, and surprise, surprise none of the party goes ascend into heaven. Instead they are forced to walk the Earth until they are worthy to ascend or die. The majority of this movie involves the characters trying to survive after the initial destruction and their pursuit to make amends for past sins.

There were parts of this film that were incredibly funny. Michael Cera and the cell phone bit was nothing short of amazing. Watching Emma Watson manhandle the group of guys with an axe, woozers! Or Emma overhearing them talk about what they might do to her...priceless.

However, there were many ""jokes"" that fell flat. Listening to the guys argue over who would eat the Snickers bar, for example. Or the Poltergeist scene with Jonah (it had so much potential!).

It seemed like the guys really enjoyed making this movie and had a great time. Sadly, they forgot others had to watch it, too. It felt like an insider fluff piece (some of it was designed to poke fun at this, I realize), but was too long and almost unwatchable.

5603666,5,B00BEJL69U,"One of the best movies out of Hollywood in ages: they are clearly taking the surgical knife of truth to themselves, these actors. They are making fun of everything that is empty and shallow in themselves and in America and in humanity itself. The jism scene went on a little long but it was really just showing how ""gerbil wheel"" sex, as a pursuit, ends up: repetitive and boring (one jack-off is much like all the rest). This movie skewers our sense of entitlement and selfishness, and how so many people who call themselves ""spiritual"" or ""Christians"" really are praying for their brothers' demise (and how THAT ends up). Superiority and inferiority are sides of the same downhill spiraling coin, and this movie shows that in an entertaining way. If it offended you, it's because you hate looking at your own motives clearly. If it bored you, you have a false sense of goodness that will take you to the very fires of hell itself. I will pray for you! I am buying this movie and showing it to anyone who will watch.",1408060800,,1017,4.562841530054645

5603719,5,B00BEJL69U,"This movie is incredibly funny on more than one level. The ability of the actors to both play themselves and parodies of themselves alone is very clever. At first the plot seems second to this, but as it builds in absurdity and over the top- over the top again humor, you begin to realize that there is a some brilliant writing beneath this.  (Pay attention to the stoned Rogen and Franco foreshadowing early in the movie- a bit that only reveals how funny it is after a couple of viewings.)

The interplay and dialog of these characters/actors is astonishing at times. It is almost as if each actor contributed their lines independently during the writing process-- in their own voices, delivered in response to the other character.  This improv work combined with the whole tone and pace of the movie is genius.

The movies describes their misadventures in trying to stay alive during the ensuing chaos, as they battle demons, hunger, thirst, cataclysms -- but mainly battling among themselves.

The producers dropped many different movie cliches in the plot -- the exorcism scene is the most prominent example -- and the script employed a few Hollywood in-jokes. There are many, many cameos in the film from contemporary music and movie illuminaries. The movie also had some serious aspects to it. A running theme, for example, dealt with the nature of redemption. This is a perfectly natural concern in the movie, because during the Apocalypse tsking place in the movie some people  experienced the Rapture and ascended to heaven and our main characters were struggling to find a way to ascend as well.

As the movie opens Seth Rogan, playing himself, is picking up his friend Jay at the airport. Jay has come to town to hang out get high with his buddy, and while Seth wants to hang out with Jay too, he also wants Jay to make friends with some of his Hollywood buddies, and they head over to a party James Franco is hosting at his new mansion. Jay doesn't fit into the superficial world of Hollywood, and doesn't like Seth's friends; Jonah Hill, Emma Watson, Rihanna, Danny McBride and a host of other current stars. Jay finally talks Seth into walking down to a local store for a pack of smokes, when the Rapture occurs, and several people are taken up to Heaven in beams of light.

Jay and Seth head by to James Francos and discover that the party is still in swing, and that none of the Hollywood elite have been taken to Heaven. Los Angeles becomes Hell on Earth, with huge sinkholes opening up, and demons running around beheading people, so Jay and Seth decide to stay at Francos until help comes.

There are some real moments of fun in ""This is the End"", but with that said, I'm not sure I would recommend a purchase of ""This is the End"", but I would highly recommend at least a rental from Amazon Instant. You'll get a few chuckles here and there, but as the movie plays out, like quite a few of these films, it just goes on way too long.

It has a hilarious cast, crude and clever gags that could be enjoyed by cinephiles and stoner couch potatoes alike, and it's bolstered by a strong premise that allows for organic situation comedy. It's a film about a group of actors trapped in a house during the apocalypse. For that kind of set-up, there is not another group of Hollywood misfits that could have possibly made a movie better than This Is the End. The sheer energy of the script and chemistry between the hysterical actors is amazing. It's also very fun to watch a group of people the audience feels like they already know. The actors riff off their public personas in a totally amusing way and make one wonder how much of a difference there is between the actor and the character. The dynamic between Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel is a solid dramatic anchor while the conflicts between Craig, Jonah, James, Danny, and Emma Watson offer lots of genuine laughs. In sheer filmmaking terms, This Is the End is actually pretty impressive for Seth and Evan Goldberg's debut. The camerawork is pretty tight while the special effects, for a stoner comedy, are fantastic. With an eclectic and lively soundtrack as a cherry on top, This Is the End was the surprise comedy of last year, and probably one of the funniest films of the new millennium.

Brain-damaged teens in a group home could hone better dialogue.

I loved that these very famous comedic actors were playing themselves, most often at their very worst. They set it in real time reality, where these actors had made the movies we love them for, and used that to play up some very funny jokes and scenes, including the homemade sequel to Pineapple Express. However, despite all the crazy antics and cameos (Backstreet Boys!) and sometimes disgusting content, at the heart of this movie is the power of friendship. In the end, friendship and self sacrifice are the keys to the kingdom, literally. Though this theme is couched in a raunchy, apocalyptic comedy, it still maintains its power through the wonderful acting of all the main characters, but especially through Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel.

5603993,1,B00BEJL69U,"entirely terrible.

I saw some okay special effects and a couple (literally) funny bits, but there was just so much cursing...drugs...and wrong ideas about the Bible that I wasn't impressed. It wasn't meant to be a Christian flick and I wasn't expecting it to be, of course. Although I knew that they'd get some things wrong, it was just surprising how insulting and lame it was.

Someone praying and asking God for Him to kill a person, while saying that He'd be cool if He did? Check. The belief of many that good works are what you must do so, if the good outweighs the bad, you can earn your way into heaven? Check. Stating that what's happening is written in the book of REVELATIONS (there no 's' in that book of the bible)? Yes. At the end of the flick, using drugs in heaven and being taught by a cursing angel that anything you wish for there will be yours? Check. All of that, and more, are portrayed by a bunch of actors (using their own names, which was different and the only original thing here) during the events of the rapture event and apocalypse.

It's too-long of a flick. It's full of rotten music & 'partying', where getting high + drunk while looking ridiculous is the most important thing in the characters' lives (which is what a lot of real people sadly believe, too). This is the movie for any of you who were hoping to see guys drink their own urine, talk about rape, and have an extended argument concerning male ejaculation. If that's not enough, there are also male demons with emphasized genetalia and a scene of cannibalism. It covers the whole gamut of sickening stuff. There was basically nothing funny attempted that didn't include something disgusting. In many other R comedies (like the 'classic' ""There's Something About Mary""), I've found more creativity and at least some attempts at humourous segments that wouldn't have been R-rated on their own. A best part in this flick -- which wasn't funny -- was when one of the actors spoke of how it seemed wrong that he made more money than those with important careers. I guess, however, he and everyone in this piece of dreck still made a bunch of money.

I give it the rare 1-star rating. I always try for at least 2-stars (which means 'I don't like it' at Amazon) on anything that didn't appeal to me, but this one is deserving of the 'I hate it'.",1398297600,5,2334,4.523696682464455

Perhaps this is how much of the youth lives and speaks today, so maybe that's the effect for which they were looking.

This pokes fun at the very people who put this together but does it in a very creative way.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I think many of the bad reviews are from people that just don't get it.  It's not played straight and there are a lot of pop culture jokes and references that might just fly over the heads of some viewers.  You probably either think this is genius or just stupid.  I'm in the genius camp.",1395619200,2,786,4.18

5604134,4,B00BEJL69U,"I don't think there has been a film to come out in recent memory that had me so entertained and yet so disappointed as This is the End.  Its not that my expectations were astronomical, and like I said, I was entertained immensely, but there was something about the film itself that left me feeling like it kept pulling itself back from being great.  Its so preposterous and so outlandish and yet I couldn't help but feel that most of the film was skirting around actually being as preposterous and as outlandish as it wanted to be.

Dont get me wrong; this film is ridiculously off-color and offensive and yetnot?

Maybe its just that weve become so desensitized by the barrage of Judd Apatow films that throw everything in our face and dare us to get offended, but I found very few things about this film particularly inventive in the idea of outrageous comedy, and I even think other films have gone further and been more creative in their use of offence to entertain (like, Tropic Thunder steamrolls this film in making the offensive so utterly digestible while maintaining a level of shock).  Still, while nothing feels inventive or new, the cast is hilariously on point and they sell everything.

Also, is it just me or was this one of the best films since Being John Malkovich to exploit the stereotype of celebrity while giving actors a perfect canvas to make fun of their own reputations?

So, This is the End basically takes Project X, mixes in something like Cloverfield and sprinkles in The Exorcist, all the while trying to one-up those Scary Movie films by having all these actors do all this ridiculous stuff as themselves.  The films plot, or what there is of one, has Jay Baruchel coming to L.A. to spend time with Seth Rogen.  The two have drifted apart because Rogen is a Hollywood sell out and Baruchel is rather self-righteous and jealous of Rogens new field of friends, which include James Franco and Jonah Hill.  The night that Jay arrives in L.A., Seth takes him to Francos house warming party and soon the world starts to end, the apocalypse is in full swing and comedians start dying all over the place.  Cera is impaled, Watson becomes a warrior queen and Robinson survives far longer than one would expect (you know, since the black guy always dies first); and then there is Channing Tatum, but you need to see that for yourself.

In parts, so much of this works because it is pretty hysterical.  The getting high and filming the sequel to The Pineapple Express scene was glorious, the cannibal scene was epic and that Backstreet Boy reunion in heaven is probably the single greatest moment in film for the entirety of 2013, and yet with all that goodness I couldn't help but feel like it just didn't all come together like I thought it would have.  There were too many moments where Id come off of a HUGE laugh by being almost entirely bored with a while scene.  The film just wasn't tonally consistent, and I expected that from these guys.  The entire cast is so ON this.  Franco and Hill are easily the best in show here, completely destroying themselves by exaggerating their off-screen personas (or what we perceive them to be) and making the most of every scene (Jonah constantly thinking hes above everyone else while pretending to be genuine, and Franco cracking joke after joke about his sexuality) but I have to say that some of these scenes just lasted too long or lost their edge too quickly.

Alright, that joke isn't funny anymore.  Its time to move on.

I give this a solid B.  It was entertaining and in parts utterly hilarious, but this needed a trim (why is a film like this almost two hours long?) and Emma Watson obviously needed more screen-time.",1395273600,4,3694,4.626339969372129

It pokes fun at the culture of Hollywood, religious perceptions about Armageddon and just what it truly takes to find salvation when the day finally arrives. Seth and the gang find themselves trapped in John Franco's home when the end of the world arrives and what ensues is a lot of hilarious fun adventure that pokes fun of just what happens when 6 narcissistic celebrities find themselves struggling to survive.

5604242,3,B00BEJL69U,"S'ok, this is my first actual movie review, but, after investing in the cost of this crazy DVD, I felt compelled to speak on the matter...

(On an overall side note, Since the passing of hard nosed reviewers like Siskel and Ebert, clearly some of the studios have been buying those good reviews...)

I don't buy a lot of movies, but I like to have a variety of well-reviewed films in my library, (even if I don't think they're worth the full 4-stars, they're usually still a quality 3-star movie), so, when This Is The End was given a full on 4-star review by Richard Roeper, I thought, a doomsday comedy, this should be great, etc., and went ahead and got the DVD.

Granted, this film is billed as the doomsday comedy of the year where Dumb and Dumber meets the Exorcist meets Close Encounters, yada, yada, yada, and a lot of other buy this movie hype, and so forth. But, in reality, not so much (and for the record, while it did have it's amusing qualities, Dumb and Dumber was definitely NOT a 4-star movie either), so that being said...

Fame of the cameo appearances, aside, This Is the End is a film chock full of clich and c/d-talent actors. James Franco and Emma Watkins are the most talented actors in the whole film (and she had about a five-minute cameo...), the rest of the cast supporting Franco are a bunch of comedians who really aren't that funny (no offense to Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Seth Green (whose best film to date was Pineapple Express, btw-although a solid movie) , Jonah Hill, etc..., but building a career on the gratuitous gross-out/sex-comedy-train, isn't exactly the kind of star-turning-chices of A-listers that movie fans expect, you know..?)..But, in an era where a reality-show or pornographic sex tape can make you (reality-star) famous, fame and talent have clearly become two divergent forces in the whole movie-making/casting process.

And in this film, the overall cast should at least give you an idea of what's not going on (by way of acting, or plot, or story, and so forth...).

While, not the worst movie you'll ever see, it's no Close Encounters or Exorcist and not even a Sci-Fi Dumb and Dumber (and Dumb and Dumber,  ` t'aint no 4-star movie'...) .

Overall, This Is the End is a film that is marginally entertaining at BEST. They said ""Yeah"" but, we say, ""Meh"" (or not so much)...

Final grade: C- (ok to watch, but don't expect comedic genius).

Cheers!",1392681600,,2408,4.658018867924528

While being completely irreverent, especially in terms of religion - which is fine by me - it still managed to have a positive message overall - which is also fine by me.

Be advised, this film is chok full O' big boy dick and fart jokes. It is SO in your face at times that you really shouldn't bother watching it if you take yourself too seriously. Seth, Jay, Craig, Jonah, Danny and James certainly don't take themselves too seriously and that was probably the main ingredient that had me laughing out loud, which is sweet because I'm in my mid 40's and while trying not to be jaded, comedies don't make me do that very often.

If you like Seth Rogan, if you also like Kevin Smith's antics, then you should watch this NOW.

Cheers!",1391299200,2,1027,4.389473684210526

I think it's a great recipe and I don't get sick of it. Their comedy is like comfort food--you can't eat it all the time but when you want it, nothing else will hit the spot.

If you've enjoyed any of these actors' previous work you are in for a treat. They all play themselves in this souped-up (i.e. lots of drug use, stoner jokes) version of the usual suspects. Some of the characters are back for more fun (Seth Rogen, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride) and then there are a few newer faces joining the mix (see: Michael Cera in a spectacularly obnoxious version of himself with Jonah Hill close behind, and Jay Baruchel as the straight man Anti-hero). Emma Watson has a cameo as the only capable person in the entire film and she nails it. It has surprises and a couple of scenes in the movie will inevitably become legend (the Craig Robinson/James Franco argument is fabulous).

The humor is low-brow which everyone likes, and if you say you don't I call shenanigans. Demons are stalking the planet outside James Franco's house after a lame house party is cut short due to the coming of the apocalypse. The virtuous and good are spontaneously removed from the growing calamity as they are raptured. This, of course, sets the scene for all of our favorite burnouts to be left behind to deal with the End of the World! Only time you'll watch a movie about the apocalypse and feel GOOD about it.

I was scared beyond belief momentarily and amused beyond words for the remainder of the movie.  I live in the ""Bible belt"" and most of my friends would likely be offended by this movie, because it flies in the face of religion... but it does so in a really endearing way, though I'd imagine a lot of people would argue with me about that!  I know this is not a very informative review, but I really wanted to put my 5 stars up here and let everyone know that this movie is highly offensive and totally hilarious.

The movie itself is very simple with no real plot development.  They have a huge number of cameo actors who are in the movie for a couple minutes acting very much out of character or over the top.  The humor is basically a barrage of one-liners with everyone getting some spot-light.  All in all it's reminiscent of a middle school locker room.

5604945,5,B00BEJL69U,"When writing reviews of comedies it becomes quite difficult. On one hand if it's really good you want to let people know that the movie is hilarious. At the same time if you start telling the jokes or setting up the stories prior to punch lines then the jokes aren't funny for those going to see the movie (I was once told BLAZING SADDLES was hilarious but knowing the jokes didn't find it near as funny). So let's see what I can do in letting you know about THIS IS THE END just released on DVD.

It's hilarious. Okay so I know I have to go further than this. The movie involves real movie stars playing themselves, sort of. Seth Rogen stars as Seth Rogen picking up his friend Jay Baruchel at the airport for a visit in LA. They head back to Seth's house where he has everything prepared for a wonderful visit. But before the night gets too far gone he suggests they head over to James Franco's house to visit. Jay isn't quite interested because in his mind this is Seth's new friends which have helped the two part ways lately.

Of course they show and are greeted by Franco who shows them around the house he helped design. All of the gang is there too including Jonah Hill portraying himself as the nicest of guys you could ever want to meet. Craig Robertson is there as his usual laid back self. While not there at first Danny McBride makes his presence known as well. All of these actors have been together in movies one way or another over the last few years. But they're not alone.

Small parts are played by others from this same group who've been in some major hits over the past 6 years. Michael Cera (who I've never been a big fan of but who does a tremendous job of tearing apart his squeaky clean image here), Christopher Mintz-Plasse, David Krumholtz, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Mindy Kaling, Emma Watson, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari and Rihanna all make an appearance at this party. And yes each one takes a turn at making fun of themselves and Hollywood culture.

As the night moves on Seth does what Jay predicted he would which is leave him behind to spend more time with these new LA friends. Of course Jay also sets him up for failure not realizing that Seth has talked to his LA friends about accepting Jay as one of them. Eventually the duo head out to pick up a pack of cigarettes for Jay and on the way talk about the whole situation while walking. And then it happens.

In a quick mart the ground trembles, windows shatter and suddenly people are being beamed into the sky by bright blue lights. Yes it's the Armageddon and those deemed worth are being taken to Heaven. The rest are left behind. In the midst of destruction and chaos the pair return to Franco's party to discover no one there has noticed anything happening at all. A few tremors later and heading to the front lawn they discover LA a flaming mess and the ground in front of the house opening and swallowing various celebs.

So you're probably saying well gee...this doesn't sound funny at all. Trust me when I say that as the end begins so do the major laughs. I know it's hard to believe but it's true. What follows is the celebrity gang's attempt to survive and find a way to get out. The comedy plays off of their attempts at survival, their better than the rest attitudes concerning life and their confrontations with the demons and such released on this world.

The laughs come naturally in all of this world end mess rather then being forced. Comedy bits involving character, dialogue, physical comedy and situational comedy are all found here and to give up even a taste would be to ruin the movie for viewers. I saw this film at the theater and laughed more openly than I had at a comedy in years. Being able to watch it on DVD gave me the chance to hear/see the things I missed and to be able to pause if I laughed too hard.

One thing you need to realize up front though is that the humor here is some of the crudest found in some time. Jokes involving bodily fluids, sex acts and language are strewn throughout. If you've seen movies involving these actors then you already expected that. For me it didn't offend and seemed more in line with what I would actually expect from most of these actors in real life.

I can't begin to recommend this movie enough. As I said it had me near rolling on the floor at times and that was when I saw it in the theater. At home I can roll around with no one giving me the eye except for our dogs and cats. I would venture to say that this is one comedy I'd have no problem watching over and over again.

Concept: How would a group of comedians act if the Apocalypse began one night at a celebrity house party? Fail proof idea, you say?

Nope.

I had two major problems with this film. One, they killed off all of the truly funny people (I won't say whom) at the beginning and we are left with yet another stoner/fratboy comedy starring Rogen + Franco. Im not a Pineapple Express fan so I guess I was doomed from the start. Two, all of the jokes were the same: drugs, dick, rape, repeat.

There were, however, a few things about the film I loved. Michael Ceras scenes were hilarious + he only took up about 5 minutes of screen time. Jonah Hills Rosemarys Baby moment was great (no one in my theater got the reference, though). And of course, the celebrity gimp cameo was genius. I love himmmm. Im still laughing.

Overall, I really need to stop going into these movies with any expectations because Im always disappointed. I just don't understand how you can put all these funny people together + get such an unfunny movie. Nevermind, I saw Grown Ups with Adam Sandler + crew (can you believe that got a sequel?).

Anyway, I doubt Ill ever watch This Is The End again. It wasn't horrible, just not my type of comedy. You know, a funny one. Judd Apatow should have directed.

Quite often I felt like the cast was on the verge of giggling, but they did not drop any clever jokes or lines.

Only Danny McBride stands out.  He can say the nastiest things and make them funny.  Jonah Hill turns out the second best comedic performance with his constant kindness routine.

That said, there a handful of really funny parts worth seeing.  The monsters are horrifying and the giant naked demon is funny.  You'll see why.

Channing Tatum finally gets the role he was born to play.  I think he can retire now.

5605227,4,B00BEJL69U,"Hollywood has made millions out of dramatizing the pending apocalypse, but what if the apocalypse were to happen in Hollywood itself? Like, for real.

Well, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg think they know what it would be like and, in This is the End, theyve gathered some of the industrys hottest young stars - James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Rogan himself, all playing themselves - to illustrate it for us.

The question is: how do these guys - who get paid mega-bucks to essentially play at make-believe all day - do when confronted with a real-life crisis, one designed to test their mettle and their basic humanity, in which courage, heroism, self-sacrifice, quick thinking and dexterity with firearms may be the keys to survival? Turns out, just about as well as the rest of us mere mortals would. And thats the kernel upon which Rogan and Goldberg build their affectionate satire, as the boys hunker down in James Francos pad in the Hollywood Hills to try and ride out biblical doomsday in all its high-tech/CGI/matte-painted glory.

The filmmakers capture the pampered movie star lifestyle with canny accuracy: the orgiastic partying, the drinking and casual drug use, the conspicuous consumption, rampant self-indulgence and egotism run amok.  Is it any wonder, then, that none of these Hollywood types are deemed worthy of being sucked up in the rapture, but are instead left behind to fend for themselves and to think long and hard about why they couldn't go with all those other good people? And are they truly past redemption or is there some way to still make amends for a life poorly lived so that they too can take that light beam shuttle to the sky?

In addition to the leads, fellow celebrities Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, Rihanna, Channiing Tatum and The Backstreet Boys make cameo appearances either before or after the cataclysmic event.

Deftly blurring that fine line between fact and fiction, this super-meta movie features fun, self-deprecating performances and a sly and knowing script laced with amusing parodies of sci-fi/horror and action movie cliches.

Surprisingly, although this movie doesn't glorify God, the characters in the movie go from atheists to those who are raptured by a god that we never see in the movie. However, they're not saved in the rapture because God redeemed them. They're saved because they did something sacrificial. It's the sacrifice of Jesus for humans that matters, not the sacrifice of humans that matters.

The movie also pretended to quote the Bible at one point.

Another mixed message in the movie is the life in Heaven. They nicely showed that it is a big party instead of boredom. However, God has more to show us in heaven than giving us our human desires.",1387584000,,756,4.463768115942029

Every person in that movie with the exception of Danny McBride and Craig Robinson was exactly what you would expect, AGAIN.  And again, and again, and again...

Those fans of Rogan and others and his style of humor will probably like this movie, but for others, you will probably not. And if you notice that the one star reviews are as many or more than the 5 stars seems to back that thought up. For me, frankly after watching, I am still not sure what I just saw. A cross between slap stick, drugged out, dark humor science fiction film.. I really don't know. The humor for the most part is crude, going from uncomfortable man moments to drug binged stupidity to violent head chopping and soccer kicking scenes. None of it is particularly funny to me. I guess for those who are fans of Rogan's style of comedy might enjoy this but for me, I couldn't get through the movie without turning off.

Almost everyone in this film is a semi-to-legitimately talented comedian, so it's a shame that they waste their talent on this lazy foray into what they've already done a hundred times before.

Or Emma Watson's cameo as a badass as the Apocalypse swirls around her and the gang stuck at James Franco's house? And speaking of badasses--Danny McBride. Annoying, self-centered, ridiculous and by the end, evil Danny McBride. Every time he enters a scene, you know you're going to be laughing long after the scene ends because of his crazy ways.

The thing about those films though is that, while being a vanity project, they're very smartly written, expertly performed, and extremely well directed. That level of quality, on all those same levels, is severely lacking in co-directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen's apocalypse ""comedy"" THIS IS THE END.

The conceit here is that the films' stars (Rogen, James Franco, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride) are playing themselves as Franco throws a big party at his home, and suddenly the biblical Rapture begins. They're apparenly all such awful people that they are denied entrance to Heaven and have to try and survive with each other until they've done something worthy of allowing them entrance. And there's vulgarity and gross-out moments galore. And you get to see Emma Watson toss the f-bomb around. Which is funny to people who don't understand that Emma Watson has been in other things since the HARRY POTTER films.

The one thing I actually did find funny was the idea of Michael Cera being a coked-out sexual deviant. That was pretty funny for about forty seconds of the five or six minutes they use that joke for.

To the people who watched this film: Whatever your own particular sins are, watching this film from beginning to end is penance enough for just about anything you've done. It's really the worst film I've seen this year.",1384560000,4,1520,4.816091954022989

There aren't enough good points about this movie to form this as a compliment sandwich, so I'll mention the positive thing first- I liked the moments of awkward closeness brought on by the dude love bromance stuff; it was cute enough to be endearing and not too over the top so it didn't come across as sarcastic.

I was okay with the idea of watching another movie with the Superbad or Pineapple Express level of humor, I'll openly admit to having liked those! Having said that, the degree to which they would beat a dead horse beyond recognition was insufferable. I laughed toward the start of a series of cum jokes, but then it's like they didn't think anyone would get it and I spent the next ten minutes groaning and sighing as they drove it into the ground. Take that sort of ""comedy"" base, and throw in some jokes/scenes about sexual slavery and demon rape? I just wish I would have read some reviews before deciding to pick it up for the night.

Does this movie show how some groups of friends will snowball a bad joke to make it worse? Sure! Does it show how the apocalypse would tear all of the good things away from society? Sure!

I don't even know where ton begin with this outlandish plot and ridiculous concept, but it is hilarious at times (and the CGI monsters are surprisingly well done). If you are a fan of Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, or Danny McBride (or all of them), this movie will tickle your fancy like nobody's business, as the group of real life jesters play (mildly) exaggerated versions of themselves.

The dialogue is much like how friends talk when they get together and 'hang'.  I am totally confident that this gem was conceived and written while under the influence.

Yes, there is toilet humor, but it seems to come naturally from these guys and there was a real decent plot to bring it all together.  You cant take it too serious.  Reminds me of back in the day hanging out with my friends.  Really was too fun",1384041600,8,711,4.715447154471545

I'm not always a fan of stoner comedies.  I'm not one myself, and many times it seems like the movies are made to only be funny under the influence.

This is not one of those movies.  Yes, there are plenty of drug references.  Yes, it's got a lot of crude humor and offensive language.  But that's what this is supposed to be, and it does it well.  I laughed out loud more during this movie than most comedies I've seen in a while.  I'm very glad I picked it up digitally when it became available.

The cast seems very comfortable together, especially since many have worked together before.  You can really believe that these amped-up versions of themselves would really hang out together like they do in the movie.  The best part is that the movie really uses it's celebrity cameos well... I'll never look at Hermione the same way again!

A.: No. (cf. also ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bling-Ring/dp/B00F91H15W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bling Ring</a>"" where she is even worse.)

Q.: Does this new generation of Hollywood comics have either talent or brains?
A.: Hmm.  Difficult to tell.  If so, nobody thought to bring either one along on this job.

Q.: Does anyone find the concept of licking Michael Cera's sphincter intrinsically entertaining?
A.: Ick! No way! Are you ill?

Q.: Is James Franco really such a pathetic wannabe over-achiever?
A.: Sadly, too true. If he were half as friggin' smart as his publicist keeps hyping us, he'd never, ever have come near this steaming crock.

Q.: Any reason to care enough about any of these people playing themselves to bother watching?
A.: None whatsoever, unless you happen to be so ridiculously overstocked with mind-altering substances you can't think of something better to do.",1383004800,4,1077,5.530487804878049

5606412,1,B00BEJL69U,"I am totally baffled by the love so many appear to have for this movie. I absolutely hated it. It was adolescent, dumb, offensive, and just plain awful. The only parts I remotely enjoyed were lots of cameos. It's like a whole gang of Hollywood pals got together and thought to themselves, ""wouldn't it be hilarious if we could convince Hollywood that this is a movie worth making?!!"" And Hollywood did.

I really like this style of humor and I enjoyed the silly ironic twists that they added into the plot. Michael Cera is gold and the caricatures that the starring actors painted of themselves were really entertaining. I'd recommend this movie if you're into all the other stuff that these actors have been in. If you don't like their other movies, then you're probably going to be on the 1 star spectrum of viewers.",1382918400,,535,4.414141414141414

It lacks of everything, I am surprise, a lot of ""comedians"" in this movie, but not funny at all. It is horrible!, I will not buy this movie at all. It is amazing how some of these ""actors can be in a lot of movies and be funny, but together they blank out. This movie does not have a good story, and the whole thing sucks!.

5606436,3,B00BEJL69U,It's a goofy movie that pretty hilarious in parts. If you are in the mood for a cheese ball movie then this is for you,1382832000,,118,3.76
5606437,5,B00BEJL69U,Hilarious!!!  No doubt one of the funniest films out there.  Don't believe the negative criticism.  They surely do not know great comedy,1382832000,,136,5.090909090909091
5606438,2,B00BEJL69U,This movie looked like it was going to be amazing when I saw the previews. But both I and the person I saw the movie with were hugely disappointed when we left the theater. The humor is juvenile at best. The main goal of the movie seems to be just going over the top... repeatedly. Everything is very predictable.,1382832000,,313,4.322033898305085

5606464,2,B00BEJL69U,Well my son kind of liked it. But I fell asleep during it only to wake up to the same profanity being said 20 minutes later. The plot could have been cute but it went way over the top with everything trying not to be cute. Do the writers not know any other adjectives to use?  I think this film was made many for the actors that were in the movie so they could still say they are working but when the picture bombs they get a to write it off their taxes. I hated these types of guys when I went to college and still have no use for them now even in a fictional movie. So my advice watch this movie with your eyes close and save yourself some cash and don't rent it. I have seen seventh grade boys with more on the stick then these actors.,1382745600,,738,3.92
5606465,1,B00BEJL69U,"Despite the abundance of talent, this movie was gross, depressing, and vulgar. How many times can you use the F word before no one cares? There wasn't even a happy ending to redeem. SHAME!",1382745600,2,188,4.5588235294117645
5606466,5,B00BEJL69U,"Ok, as a disclaimer, if you don't like their previous work, you probably aren't going to like this.  If you found Pineapple Express funny, then there will be little chance that you won't like this.  We laughed out loud basically the whole movie but you do have to have a bit of a ""corrupt"" mind.  Again, if you get the humor these guys have presented the last few years then you will fit in just fine with this movie.  If you never like the previous movies, then why are you even bothering now?",1382745600,7,494,4.279569892473118

5606521,1,B00BEJL69U,"Seriously, this movie is crap. My wife and I were all excited to see it (cos the commercials looked funny),so she took me as part of our anniversary date. The first 15 minutes or so of the movie (that is, until the world begins to end)were absolutely hilarious, cameos from every young actor in Hollywood and Canada you could think of (Michael Cera's best work: EVER), but then it just became stupid and unwatchable. Thankfully, it was short; coming in at just over an hour and 10 minutes or so.

If this movie were free on Netflix, I'd surely pass on it and watch old episodes of Breaking Bad, or Trigun...just anything but repeat the bore that was ""This is the End"".",1382745600,3,668,4.475409836065574

It has major funny moments but it is not a movie for people that have issues with profanity or vulgarity. You'll get plenty if both in this one.

It's right up there with pineapple express (which if you liked pineapple express you def HAVE to see this!!!), 40 year old virgin (minus any sappiness), and superbad, just to name a few similarly raunchy/ridiculous movies. The amount of celebs in this movie is awesome and it's even better when you read about some of the behind the scenes stuff and actually know how the actors are portrayed in the media to understand how they're spoofing themselves!",1382572800,,683,4.560975609756097

Set at James Franco's house just after the rapture and the start of the apocalypse, this movie gets a lot of mileage out of poking fun at celebrity personas, recreational drug use and the post apocalyptic genre. If it falters anywhere it's in the relationship between Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen that is supposed to serve as the through line for the movies series of events. Their friendship drama just isn't all that interesting. But it's worth the price of admission just for Michael Cera and Emma Watson and their scene stealing.",1382572800,,613,4.531531531531532

Insane. Hilarious. Shocking. Ridiculous. Awesome. Offensive. Wonderful. Exciting.

I started smiling about 3 seconds into the movie and wasn't able to stop until about an hour after it had ended.
The cast acted impeccably.
The surprise cameos were perfect.
The shock factor was over the top.
The comedy was historical (Yes, historical as in one for the books.)
The comedy was hysterical.
The twists and turns left me bewildered as to what would happen next.

The boys have definitely outdone themselves with this one.",1382486400,,566,5.075268817204301
5606553,2,B00BEJL69U,"The two biggest takeaways I got from this movie were: 1) Maybe it's funnier if you actually know who all these people are and what their real personalities are like.  There was a definite ""insider"" vibe to a lot of the jokes. 2) If this is supposed to be some examination of faith (in religion, in friendship, in weed, take your pick), it failed miserably.  There was no consistency or theme throughout the film.  I also didn't find a lot of the jokes - rape, weed, etc. - at all funny.  There were a couple cute moments, but I don't think this one's worth the price of admission.",1382486400,2,580,4.342592592592593

After so many times the F word really loses all meaning and just becomes annoying, and all the drug references got to be annoying too.  We get it, you say f*** a lot and all you do is smoke.  Character development is weak and plot is completely stupid.  Comedy is funny when there are elements of truth or believability, so when you don't develop a decent plot, the attempt at humor just seems stupid.

If you're a pot head or are starstruck by the cast enough to ignore the actual lack of good content, you might like this.

If you think I'm a movie snob, that's the not the case at all, I LOVE all of the following, for the most part:  Wedding Crashers, Harold and Kumar (all of them), American Pie (most of them), Step Bros, 40YO Virgin, and SuperBad.

5606654,3,B00BEJL69U,"I was really impressed with the overall approach to this film. It is not your average comedy and that is not just based on its apocalyptic approach. Overall the film has a style and a variety that works which is something I haven't seen in a while in cinema.
I'm not here to bore everyone I'm sure everyone knows the general outline. My overall message is that the film is not for everyone and if you do not have previous knowledge of most of these actors one is less likely to enjoy it more than the individual who is a fan. There are many instances and moments where it's enjoyable to watch because you understand where these guys come from. I believe this is great but also selfish. I have explained the former but the latter alludes to the lack of pure comedy this film posses to where not everyone will laugh or be comfortable with what is occurring. This is why many people have claimed to lose interest because there is not a reason to care for the cast unless you are general fans and just not looking for something to laugh at.
I overall recommend giving it a shot because I believe it has a versatile solid dialogue and a surprising (to myself) underlying plot line, enough for a big picture good rating. It is not perfect and has many mishaps but I believe if your looking for a good laugh as a casual to handle with care, it is worth it despite not being laugh out loud.",1382227200,,1382,4.319230769230769

5606656,1,B00BEJL69U,"Which is to say this movie is terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  Yes.....we get it Seth.....you and your buddies like to do drugs.  Newsflash....that had 30 seconds of entertainment value, 30 years ago.  Maybe its time you made a movie about something other than you and your buddies doing drugs.

OK....I will admit.  Seth and his buddies doing drugs while hanging out with the most worthless scum they can find amongst the has been crowd of actors, when none other than the apocalypse happens,  BRIEFLY raised an eyebrow.  But this is like halfway into the movie where we have to endure Seth doing drugs with his friend who has come to visit him and it seems like they no longer have fun together, primarily because Seth's friend still smokes pot while Seth has moved on to a group of friends that prefer harder drugs.

Whoa.....what a plot.  Academy award stuff, I guess.

So ""the rapture"" happens.  In between snide anti-Christian propaganda, there is some sliver of self-awareness that (gasp)  Seth and his friends aren't good people, which is why they were left behind.  Of course, that awareness seems limited to understanding they were bad friends.  And redemption is literally a matter of ""doing a solid"" for one's buds, without spewing too much profanity in the process.  Heaven seems mostly a place where you get to see the Backstreet Boys again.  A word of advice.  If you wake up after death and see the Backstreet Boys doing their thing....you probably aren't in heaven.

What gives this movie a big goose egg is the complete lack of any humor at all.  The movie is nearly two hours long.....can I get a joke here?  Something?

All those good reviews.....beats me.  Probably drug addicts that make it a point to lie about any movie with a pro-drug theme.

However, at times it's so over the top you can tell where the budget was and was not.  It's a cute movie, it's slap stick comedy and tons of star cameos... but mostly it's a movie u watch when there's nothing else to watch and need a cheap laugh.  It's not quite side splitting and not really intellectual... just so-so.

Neither movie has a proper ending!  The stories were very poorly written.  The humor was there in both but only in small doses.  The overall experience of This Is The End is that of a person reluctantly reading the Christian Bible and turning it into a sitcom but then having to end the show three episodes into the season.

I expected a lot more from such an all-star cast.  The movie was not nearly as exciting as the trailers made it seem, and the timing of the trailers made some jokes seem a lot funnier than they actually are in the film.  Overall, I am being generous with a 3/5.",1381968000,,756,4.172413793103448

5606897,2,B00BEJL69U,"SPOILERS:

didn't suck cause it had some elements of truth. main problems were film needed a stronger villain, one who had an articulated agenda and who appeared before the final act. In the Romero films at least there were newsmen to provide information about the sudden chaos, and in the Alien films, at least there was an android to explain why the monster was allowed on board; this story gave us nothing but what the impacted characters could figure out for themselves, but the writers didn't use the first act to establish the main characters as trustworthy. (Ex: paraphrase, out of town friend: ""so you've given up gluten, I guess that means you've stopped smoking pot and drinking too."" Seth character: ""no I'm not psychotic."" So does the audience trust a slacker character's perspective at the end of the world? And if so, why?). Definitely needed the villains point of view.  The film also needed a tighter structure, which would've been partially fixed by having the villain appear earlier in the story.

film paid homage (i.e., stole from) many other films, normal for hollywood. what I found interesting was the subtext of what it might be like for some to be youngish, semi-rich and semi-famous in hollywood; the off-putting balance between trying to straddle the world of your non-hollywood family and friends who are easily wowed by your possessions (but who you need to treat you the same as they did pre-fame because that helps anchor you), while you yourself see and understand the dirty underbelly of the fake hollywood shine, that you must network (e.g., hangout) and be perceived to share similar (e.g., supposedly hip, edgy, and/or advanced) values of the in-crowd to get ahead in the business, an apparently incoherent world where getting cleanses, smoking pot, drinking, and doing coke, are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

the hollywood in this film was the one where you needed to network with the right crowd to get work (aka hollywood as the 50s era golf course).  I think the film gave some insight into that world, showing how difficult, fake and challenging it can be in that super competitive marketplace where you are not the funniest person on the block, but one of a 100 funniest people and must find a way to differentiate yourself from the pack. to differentiate yourself you need access to people and apparently the people with power love to party so you must be willing to at least attend parties. (see the scene where one guy was laughing hysterically at some stupid joke being told by a known actor, whose name I forget (I'm middle age and ill so don't remember the names of 30 something people, though I remember his face. He dated a 30 something actress whose name I forget as well.  It's harder when you get older and are sick, the generation of actors younger than you just blur, though I try to read People online to at least keep up alittle; plus it's free to look at the magazine online)

I'm a prepper (a person who puts aside provisions in case of financial or other difficulties), so I found the story interesting from a prepper point of view, i.e., characters turning on one another when there is insufficient food/water, and the choices desperate people may make (i.e., willingness to consume body fluids when water is unavailable).

so there was truth here with regards to celebrity and ambition, and there was truth with regards to how some people are likely to react given a complete societal breakdown, but then there was the cartoony hell, devil and heaven section and I guess my biggest complaint about that is the villain wasn't written well enough. A giant devil-godzilla monster with a correspondingly giant penis is not enough of a villain. while it is true you never see penises of giant monsters, that one new element in and of itself does not a strong villain make.

what I liked about the story was how the writers showed how pedestrian the flashy hollywood is in that it depends on networking just like other businesses; and I also found it believable that stress during a societal breakdown brought out the worse in some characters. the two sequences I found most believable, and sad in a way, were (1) when the paparattzi (did I spell that right?) simultaneously harassed, insulted and asked the Seth character for a favor at the airport (""do a Seth Rogan laugh for me"") which the character obligingly does, and (2) the slimy hanger on yucking it up at the hollywood party: those situations gave what I think are an authentic, and unappealing, glimpse into what it means to be famous in this country, and were among the strengths of the story for me. I thought the acting was good. And I appreciated that the actors/actresses/filmmaking team tried to entertain me. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1381881600,,4756,4.790243902439024

5606935,3,B00BEJL69U,"Seth Rogen and his usual entourage of stoner near-celebrities return to the screen, this time propped against the backdrop of a biblical end-of-world scenario. There's a certain taste of playful irony in the fact that so many of these actors, Rogen, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride especially, who share the common criticism of merely playing themselves throughout their careers, are doing so literally this time around. They're able to play that up to ridiculous extremes and big laughs in the long-form party scene that eats up most of the first act, riffing and rolling with the punches in their never-ending quest to make the cast and crew smile. Predictably, that's the film's sweet spot - a blank slate for ad-lib spoils - and when it's finally cast aside to make way for a more coherent narrative (admittedly, a very loose one) their ship springs a big leak. Where a more thoroughly-incubated concept like Shaun of the Dead is able to easily blend quick, witty banter with big set pieces and wild, frenzied action, This is the End struggles to unify an equally diverse toolbox. I can get the fish-out-of-water aspect that was being fronted here, of a catered group of celebrities who were lost when their smartphones dropped off the grid, but that runs out of gas near the three-quarter mark and when the big special effects swing and miss, there's nothing left to carry us the rest of the way.

Now it could be just my fault that I looked at this movie containing these actors, and thought there would be some semblance to a story. Probably because, I had heard that this was the third installment to the Shawn of the Dead and Hotfuzz movies, and those two movies were pretty good. This movie was more of a voyeur journey about a party of high school (mental state) adults and how they would handle the apocalypse. Nothing really memorable about the whole movie and if it didn't have its A-Star cast, I am pretty sure no one would have given this a look. I have seen better movies made by kids on youtube that are more interesting, better written, and more memorable.

Anyone watching a movie about the apocalypse with these actors should keep a very open mind since these guys like to push the envelope. I've joked in the past about Danny McBride being the redneck gangster of the movies he's in (spoiler alert!) - so really, him being a cannibalistic rapist wasn't a surprise. (end spoiler) Don't watch this movie if you get offended by things like demons, sex, drugs, or anything that could possibly come out of these guys heads; simple as that.

Honestly, this movie was what I expected. It was meant to be silly, it wasn't meant to be an epic story. This wasn't supposed to be a tearjerker/seriously funny/with a profound moral type picture  - I think this was a movie for them to just mess around and have fun while putting out something ridiculous for their cult following. If you want something a little more serious with the same guys watch Knocked Up, Zach and Miri Make a Porno, or even Pineapple Express.

5607206,5,B00BEJL69U,"This won't be a long review and many of you will probably not decide that this review was helpful, but I'm kind of astounded as to the poor reviews this movie is getting.  The reviews, as you can see, are pretty much split down the middle.  Very evenly divided between people that either loved the hell out of this movie, or completely hated it.  From my experience, an even split like that should tell you that the movie is definitely worth watching, but your reaction to it will be a strong-guided opinion with no type of wavering whatsoever.  So there you go.

The movie itself is ridiculous.  The story is even more ridiculous.  However, the situations are acted out so well that it left me in tears in various scenes throughout.  Without giving some scenes away, you have to understand that there is a type of comedy out there where the more ridiculous it is, the funnier it will be.  This is that type of movie.  If you can think back to movies like Wedding Crashers and Old School, the humor in those movies comes from the ridiculous predicaments the characters are placed in, and it takes a certain actor to deliver that freaked out scream that will you get you laughing out loud with no end in sight.  With that being said, if you can appreciate ridiculous and unbelievable situations being portrayed as a comedy, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film.  You don't have to be high or drunk to watch this movie, you just have to be acceptable to silly, slapstick humor.",1381536000,5,1479,4.539622641509434

I changed my mind about letting him watch this movie, as I was handing him the discs... because, frankly, I don't wanna have future conversations about this with him..it's a comedy..that's all it is.

When Seth and Jay are finally ""beamed up to heaven"", the fact Seth chose the BACKSTREET BOYS to appear, sing and perform Everybody, sent this movie's credibility down to single digits, and I lost a lot of respect for Rogan too.

NOBODY should have to end a movie like that..It was bad enough when they played it in the first part of the film.. (not a Backstreet Boys fan..toxic junk)... The ending of the movie left me believing they ended up in hell, because frankly, if that's what's up there ... I really don't wanna go...

5607310,1,B00BEJL69U,"I can count on one hand the number of movies I've walked out of or stopped watching in my home. This film has been added to that list. Most movies, even poorly made ones, have an aspect that makes them interesting. Sometimes the script is poor but the acting is solid. Other times the production value is sub-par but the plot is original. Vulgarity and irreverence can be very powerful cinematic devices in the hands of people that know what to do with them. I typically can find something of interest. After sixty minutes of this movie, I found nothing. In fact, I found myself becoming irritated and edgy as the movie progressed. The film essentially is a stream of a group of 30-something men shouting the most corrosive vulgarities at each other that the English language can muster. Any plot that exists serves merely as a framework for this raucous mess.

But even this was not bad enough to drive me to turn to something more substantial. What I came to realize is that the producer and actors appeared to be making a film to mock their viewers. Perhaps the only way the actors could stomach mocking themselves as they do in this film is to ensure that their viewers were an even bigger target. The film struck me as a project that was designed to pack as much insult, vulgarity, immaturity, and pointless drug use into 120 minutes as possible as if to say to viewers, ""Our viewers are so vacant, so Philistine that they'll watch any mindless, soul-sucking, poorly-acted, poorly-written, fodder we can produce and here's the proof."" It is when this feeling became overwhelming that I finally turned it off. In retrospect, it was 45 minutes later than I should have.",1381536000,3,1672,4.667796610169492
5607311,4,B00BEJL69U,"""This is the End"" is a funny in joke, as long as you know the actors, and are appreciative of Apatow family of films.  It's good stuff from start to about the finish, but there does have to be a little appreciation for the actors in this film.  The film features exaggerated versions of the actors playing themselves, often in self deprecating ways, in the midst of an apocalypse/rapture.  A lot of the humor is derived on the actors' portrayal of themselves, often poking fun at their common depictions in their films.  For example, there's a joke about Seth Rogen always playing himself while Jonah Hill is creepily nice and Michael Cera in a cameo is a downright jerk.  This type of humor drives a lot of the film's jokes and keeps the pace going.

But like all films with this crew, it has heart and has a story that carries it beyond the humor.  The bonding and growth of the friendship of Seth and Jay is central to the story.  Yes, characters do learn lessons.  Without giving away a major plot point, there is an allusion to the idea that most actors don't deserve to be saved from the apocalypse.  The story works.  And you can't help but feel this is some sort of catharsis for the actors involved in this movie (and reportedly, it is).

The movie loses some steam towards the very end.  It feels a little rushed.  But admittedly, there's only so many ways you can go with an idea like this.  The movie rests mostly on its continual humorous banter between these very talented comedians.  In some ways, this reminded me of another self referential comedy - Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back by Kevin Smith.  That film was very forced and I could only love it so much.  This is the End is the way to do it.  It feels very loose, fun, and honest - Never forced.  It's rooted very much in the improvisational gifts of these comedians.  If you've been following their work thus far, you'll enjoy it.  Not recommended for newcomers of their work though.",1381449600,26,1955,4.463276836158192

5607415,4,B00BEJL69U,"I really love the premise of this movie and my love for the premise might be effecting my over all opinion of the film. Whenever I really love the premise of a movie I am almost always a little disappointed in the actual execution. I never quite feel like any movie is able to live up to my expectations or I start thinking of all the things I wish they had done or I wish they had not done or done differently. I love the idea of a self-lampooning comedy about actors who play themselves and are trapped in a house at the end of the world. I also am a big fan of Michael Cera -  who, admittedly, is only in the first twenty minutes or so of the movie, but is responsible for what I think were the film's funniest moments - and Jonah Hill - who does a great job lampooning his reputation as a ""nice guy"" in this movie.

I also love the way the film focused on the changing relationships between the main characters who are left after the apocalypse (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride). The layers of Hollywood phoniness begin to peel off as they are trapped in the house and their true feelings begin to come to light and it gives rise to a number of really hilarious moments between the characters. The changing relationships also allowed the filmmakers to make a movie that takes place almost entirely inside a house while still maintaining the audience's interest (more on this a little later).

There are really, I think, two kinds of humor in the movie: there is what I will call character comedy, for lack of a better term, and there is gross out comedy. Character comedy includes the ridiculousness or exaggeration of certain characters. Jonah Hill's false veneer of friendliness is hilarious and Danny McBride's crudity and unconcern for everyone else brings a lot of laughs (although I started to get a bit frustrated by it at some point). Character comedy also includes moments where characters do things that seem out of character (think about Quagmire's love for cats in Family Guy). For example, the idea of all of these actors being scared and cuddling up to sleep together. The best character comedy in the movie, in my opinion, is the portrayal of Michael Cera as a coke addled womanizer. The movie is worth watching for that alone but there is a lot of great character comedy in the movie.

There is also a lot of crude humor in the movie. I feel like there was kind of a shift in humor after South Park became really popular. South Park somehow managed to elevate low brow humor into high brow humor and there was a huge influx of crude humor as a result. I certainly have nothing against crude humor (I love South Park) but I feel like there has been such an influx of it (The Hangover, The 40 Year Old Virgin, etc.) that it has lost some of its shock value. When Cartman defecates on Mr. Garrison's desk it is shocking and unexpected and the humor is at least partly based on the shock. However, I feel like we are accustomed now to guys talking about masturbation in extremely explicit terms, urine jokes, etc, and it is no longer as shocking or funny. So, this is my long-winded way of saying: I loved the character humor in the movie, I think it really worked, but I was not as impressed with the attempts at crude humor, I don't think they worked as well.

I also felt, at times, like the movie was reaching for a story line. They had a great premise: actors trapped in a house at the end of the world, but then they were faced with the problem: what are the characters going to do trapped inside a house for an hour and forty-five minutes? The scenes where they are making a sequel to Pineapple Express, and the scene where they take ecstasy and dance around, felt like they were just filler, attempts to give everyone something to do, that were loosely stitched together. It would have been easy to make a story out of the end of the world if the characters had been trying to get somewhere but the premise of the movie is: they are trapped in the house. That made it difficult to construct a story. However, I will say this: I was never bored.

Finally, I felt like the end was a bit predictable. I am not sure that could have been avoided but the fact that I had guessed how it was going to end before it actually ended detracted from the experience a bit for me. SPOILER ALERT. I knew that when Craig decided to sacrifice himself he was going to get sucked up to heaven and I knew that when Seth decided to let go he would be taken up to heaven as well. I was surprised and pleased with Franco's unexpected fall from grace and I really enjoyed Danny McBride as a cannibal and the final vision of Satan striding over Hollywood as it burned. All of that made up somewhat for the predictability.

Overall, I think the movie was definitely worth watching, it is one of the better comedies I have seen in awhile, but it still suffered from what I consider to be some minor problems that kept it from being what I would consider a perfect comedy (if such a thing exists).",1381276800,,5046,4.390374331550802

5607455,3,B00BEJL69U,"(3.5 Stars)

THIS IS THE END is a whacky film that guarantees laughter from a wide-ranged audience. Directed and Produced by comedy super-team Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, THIS IS THE END brings many of the gut-busting hijinks viewers have grown accustomed to from their previous films SUPERBAD and PINEAPPLE EXPRESS.

This film is hilarious, largely due to each actor playing fictionalized versions of themselves. As expected, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill retain their comedic pace from their other movies, but the unexpected comedy from Michael Cera, Emma Watson, James Franco, and even the Backstreet Boys is what carries this film from ""haha"" funny to hard-to-breath funny. Once Danny McBride enters the party, the already amplified laughs increase tenfold.

Some film viewers may be offended at some of the crass bantering, especially when Danny McBride is involved. If you are offended by conversations involving masturbation or by statues of genitalia, you may want to sit this one out.

What prevents a five-star rating for this film are the over-the-top, end-of-the-world moments. The non-stop laughter pauses and is replaced by ""huhs?"" and ""WTFs"" (though I suppose some may find demons running about as hilarious).

5607485,1,B00BEJL69U,"When I saw the listing of actors for this film, I had high expectations.  The cast would normally be quite funny.  In fact, I usually enjoy comedies that push the line and have a bit of ridiculousness.  For example, I liked Superbad, Wedding Crashers, etc.  So, a bit of crass comedy doesn't bother me.  What troubles me here is the plot is a bunch of actors just goofing off and doing stupid stuff without a real storyline.

How many times is it funny (if ever) to watch guys smoking weed and doing drugs without there being a bigger plot?  How about a few B-rated bloody attack scenes with bloody heads rolling around just for the hell of it? Maybe this is edgy and cool to high school kid.  But, it's not particularly clever (i.e. Half Baked) and lacks real comedic talent.  All of these actors have done better in other roles.  So, it would have been much more funny if they had a background and a decent plot to accompany the drug use and vulgarity (i.e. Harold and Kumar).  In fact, I can imagine a lot of funny scenarios with the whole ""end of the world"" background.

I did not laugh once during the entire film.  It was not funny or entertaining to watch people being killed during the end of the world scenario.  I wasn't offended.  However, I wasn't entertained.

Yes, that's exactly what it's like--but someone's really, really bad home movie. About the worst movie I've seen this year. The plot was horrible, the jokes were horrible, it's interesting that they can't act themselves well, either, and most of it seemed like they were really just making a home movie for themselves and hoping everyone would pay to see it. Well, I guess that part ended up to be true.

The concept of the entire cast playing themselves through an entire movie is interesting and could have proven quite good if done well. But this wasn't. In one scene Seth and James are talking about a sequel to Pineapple Express (which I loved). This doesn't look or feel like a real conversation at all. It feels entirely staged and fake, almost like someone is feeding them questions in an interview.

After reading the reviews I thought this movie would be the bomb!

I was sadly mistaken and I'm beginning to wonder if the previous commenters are people being paid to beef up this stupid, STUPID, Joke of a  movie..
The only way one could enjoy this movie, is with a bunch of stoners stoned.
Fortunately, I don't smoke weed, so I missed out on all of the high hilarity.

Bad, just terrible, is the only thing I can say about this movie.
I'd ask for a refund if I could.  The only thing I laughed at was the fact, I had to literally ""force"" myself to sit through it.
Which I normally would NOT! I kept thinking, about..every 15 minutes or so, OK maybe this is where it's going to get funny & entertaining...Never Happened..BIG Disappointment.
Had I rented this at Redbox it would have been back in the plastic container in 2.5 seconds. With a SCATHING email to follow.

This movie is NOT funny! It's very, very, STUPID. I can't express this enough.
With a pretty much all star cast, such as Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Jonah Hill you'd think they could have created something a little more entertaining.
Apparently, they all got ""HIGH together"" and decided to make THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!
You'd have to be on some type of drug's to write & produce this piece of CRAP!
How it made it to a movie theater is mind boggling.

I take my movie watching seriously, as in my opinion, 1 hour and 46 minutes is a lot of time invested in GARBAGE!.
I give credit when credit is due. This movie is 10 thumbs DOWN!
Three words come to mind when I think of the garbage I just paid to watch! Terrible, Dumb, Stupid!

Do not allow any child/teen view this movie. It's has a very disturbing EXPLICIT sex scene (as FAR as they could push it) It is beyond gross!
 With the rest of the actor's engaging in a lot of of Drug use, mixed with Violence, and Idiotic Gore.
The actor's are so stoned, there isn't one rational ""thinker"" through  the entire movie.  No PLOT!

 Unfortunately Amazon doesn't allow us to select 1/4 of a star.
 This movie doesn't qualify for 1/4 of a star, let alone a 1 full star!

Rent at your own risk. Not worth 2 cents. You will be sadly disappointed. You have been WARNED! BAD, BAD, BAD!
This movie goes down as one of THE WORST MOVIES EVER of all times.

Over the last few years, I've sorta' become divided by the disaster genre. On the one hand, I like seeing the social commentaries within the human interactions, but then it's also kinda' neat to see stuff get destroyed. Regardless of how you put it, though, a lot of these invasion, Apocalypse, or outbreak movies almost always tend to be really serious (unless it was directed by Roland Emmerich). And then I discovered ""This Is the End."" The story is something of a self-deprecating caricature of these Hollywood actors being over-the-top versions of themselves and follows Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, and many others celebs having a housewarming party at Franco's. But when the Apocalypse occurs (yes, the same one that's in the Bible) and things start to go crazy, the lone handful of these surviving actors decide to take shelter within Franco's house in an attempt to live it out. But it's not just the rationing of food and water and the loss of the Internet they have to deal with. They also have to survive.. each other.

If you've seen pretty much any comedy film starring any combination of these guys within the last half-decade or so, you should already know what to expect: raunchy humor, lots of cussing, crass back-and-forth banter, the occasional cutoff or dismembered body part, borderline-annoying personal issues, and possibly some drug-induced humor. It can be pretty hit-or-miss. Although, given each of these actors' recent box office numbers, I guess most people like 'em, anyway, so it really just comes down your own personal preference in humor and how much of these guys' personalities you can stomach. Personally, I like the movie a lot. It's sort of a mashup of Pineapples Express (same writers, most of the main cast, and a buddy comedy), Tropic Thunder (a parody of how egotistical Hollywood personalities deal with catastrophe), and just a little bit of Shaun of the Dead (funny, but occasionally gory and tense). If you know these guys' careers, it's probably safe to say you'll like it. If you're not a fan their brand, keep expectations low, give it a rent, and maybe you'll like it, anyway.

Shot with the Red Epic at a native 5K resolution, the video is dang-near perfect. The director of photography was Brandon Trost whose most recent works I've seen include his collaborations with Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor for Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Crank: High Voltage. Needless to say, those two movies look amazing, which kinda' surprised me when I learned he'd be the DP for this crazy action-thriller-comedy. And while just about every shot looks extremely sharp, there's only a very minor level of lost detail. A lot of the explanation can be heard in the special features where Trost talks about wanting to give the film a very apparent Apocalyptic vibe, which in turn led to a lot of low-lit shots and an orange/amber color timing. Pretty much the beginning and end of the movie, all of which are outside Franco's house, look pretty good. Otherwise, most of the film has a sort of dingy look with lots of intentional flaring to give it a more dramatic effect (Goldberg and Rogen actually take a small crack at the use of lens flares in the commentary).

Additionally, since this is also a kind of a dramady with a decent amount of dialogue, many of the shots and framing involve a good amount of closeups, meaning what could've been worse in terms of video quality actually isn't that bad because the closeness makes up for some the lack in detail. That being said, there's still a lot of texture in faces and objects (though it *really* depends on the camera angle and lighting) and some pretty good line detail and shadow delineation. There's not a whole of light to work with because of the sets, so the result often looks a tad murky. Skin and flesh tones are pretty normal (again, for pretty much any scene not inside Franco's house), but for the most part have a goldish, orangey-Apocalyptic hue to 'em. Also of surprise, a lot of the film's CG looks quite passable (given the nature of the movie). And I'm happy to report that there's no heavy banding, digital noise, artificial sharpening, or any of those anomalies that can sometimes creep their way into digital photography.

Films like Tropic Thunder, The Other Guys, and Pineapple Express sound *really* good for comedies, but tend to lack that extra ""oomph"" in the LFEs. Okay, I lied. There is *one* movie that is predominantly a comedy that I can think of that has some pretty awesome sound, and that's Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle. But other than that, most other action-comedies only sound great (instead of jaw-dropping); not so, here, in This Is the End. Mixed, designed, and edited by Michael Babcock, who previously only did additional work in such blockbusters as War of the Worlds, Transformers, The Dark Knight (and Rises), The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Inception, I think it's safe to say the guy had some great-sounding movies to use for reference in his first big gig as the sound boss.

There's a pretty decent amount of dialogue in the film with only a small portion of action. But wow, do those sequences sound amazing. As usual, the actual dialogue itself is nice and clear from the center channel with no signs of dropout or other volume issues (kinda' hard to screw that up, I would think). And with the amount of record-label music that they play, the mix actually utilizes a good deal of the rears and sub-woofer (Backstreet Boys and Gangnam Style sound particularly good in lossless). The action sequences, however, are the unsung hero, here. When the earth splits open to create sinkholes, when demons come crashing through stuff, or when chaotic situations arise, it's actually a very high-quality and potent mix that I wasn't expecting at all. Rear channels divi up the sound and create great separation. Dynamics handle very well when transitioning from really quiet parts to really loud ones, and LFEs are deceptively deep when things blow up or a monster pops out of nowhere. It's another one of those cases of ""quality over quantity,"" and, boy, is this mix quality!

Extras - 4.5

Note: All of the special features are in HD (aside from the commentary, obviously, which is in lossy 2.0).

Disc 1

- Audio Commentary (Directors Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen)
You'd think for a couple of guys who try so hard to be funny that they wouldn't give that great a commentary. Wrong. This commentary is *full* of very useful information covering all the bases from filming, writing, anecdotes, cracking jokes, and any number of interesting trivia. The commentary itself was actually recorded the day before the movie hit theaters, so it was especially neat to hear them be so confident, yet stay so laid back and just spout out all the stuff that they did. This is an extremely jovial and insightful track that actually raised my appreciation for the film a lot more, and I definitely recommend any of you that liked the movie to really give this a listen. Some of the things they talk about were a lot of the improv from the actors that went into certain scenes, how the entire thing was set in L.A., but actually filmed in New Orleans, some of the subtleties that went into the production, trivial facts about the actors, stories about how this or that event led to what you see on screen, jokes about lens flares, and a lot more.

- Directing Your Friends (6:30)
Talks about how all the main characters know each other, their comfort level in working with/off one another's performances (because of their friendships), and that if they all *weren't* doing it together, that they probably would never have made this movie in the first place.

- Meta-Apocalypse (7:43)
Most of the actors delve into the reasoning they're playing exaggerated versions of themselves, talk a little bit about how they're *not* like that in real life, and kinda' laugh at the ""character"" versions of themselves and their friends.

- Let's Get Technical (10:44)
As the title implies, this feature talks about the technical aspects of the movie. In particular, it covers the cinematography with DP Brandon Trost, the stunts with coordinator Steven Ritzi, and then takes a look at some of the visual effects (particularly, the guy they lit on fire 9 times in a day).

- Party Time (12:54)
Covers the production and design of Franco's house, the stuff inside (like the art and decor), and takes a detailed look at all the celebrity party guests who cameo'd in the film. Additionally, it then covers some of the special effects for when things start to go bonkers in plot.

- The Cannibal King (4:25)
A kind of outtake reel containing alternate takes of McBride and his pet, Channing Tat-yum, that's simultaneously interspersed with another candid walk-n-talk where McBride and Tatum ad-lib with each other in front of the camera saying they'll be each others' slut anytime they need to.

- The Making of ""The Making of Pineapple Express 2"" (6:20)
A look at how they made the in-movie trailer for another movie that could very well exist some day, though probably with a different story by then. Contains some deleted material that didn't quite make it into the final version.

- Jay & Seth vs. The Apocalypse -- The Original Short (9:58)
A pretty serious short that the two actors made back in '07. It's a lot darker than what this movie turned out to be and may very well surprise you.

- Line-O-Rama
Some pretty hilarious alternate takes with rapid-fire deliveries that utilize a lot of improv and on-the-fly ad-libbing. I honestly had tears rolling down the corners of my eyes for the second and third scenes. Of course, your mileage may vary depending on your sense of humor. The scenes include:

Sleepover (1:14)
We Don't Know You Man! (3:27)
Cum Battle (8:06)

- This is the Gag Reel (6:16)
A modestly funny gag reel of the people goofing off on set.

- Deleted Scenes
Some of these scenes weren't even completed. Although, surprisingly enough, some of them weren't that bad. Scenes include:

Cocaine with Michael Cera (1:03)
The Guys Talk About Kicking Danny Out (2:44)
Being Green (1:18)
Eulogies for the Dead: Live Together, Die Alone (3:41)
Jay and Jonah Talk (3:07)
Michael Likes to Go Dancing (1:53)
Pre Jonah Exorcism (0:48)
The Guys Talk About F#(%ing Each Other (1:18)

- This is the Marketing
Some funny viral videos to promote the movie that they posted around the Internet, on TV, or in theaters:

Marketing Outtakes (6:38)
Aziz Haunts Craig (1:02)
James and Danny Confessional (1:17)
Jonah Confessional (1:16)
Seth and Jay Confessional (0:56)
The Cast (3:43)
Red Band Sizzle Trailer (1:52)

Disc 2 (Best Buy has an exclusive BD bonus disc; this is what's on on it, if you're curious)

- James Franco's House (8:36)
A more in-depth look at how production designer Chris Spellman built Franco's house, which is *not* what his house is really like at all (Franco points out in the interview that he has an apartment in New York in the Lower East Side). However, a lot of the art you see (particularly the paintings) were, in fact, made by Franco, himself.

- The Making of This Is the End (14:28)
A conglomerate of a lotta' the special features already presented on disc 1, but in a different order. It's not that much more insightful. Although, there's a tiny bit of the footage that's actually not rehash. Worth a look every now and then, but not detrimental to really appreciating the film (unlike the stellar commentary).

Overall - 4.5

I really wanted to see this in theaters, but never made the time. However, getting this movie as an almost complete blind-buy was well worth the price. If you like these guys and know what kind of comedy to expect, you'll probably find it an absolutely hilarious time. It's chock full of dirty humor, foul language, and some nice references to other movies. But it's also surprisingly tense and actiony, at times. With near-reference video, definitive-reference audio, and a very enjoyable set of special features, I think it was well-worth the money spent. Highly recommended for fans.",1380931200,3,12600,4.807301293900185
5607735,5,B00BEJL69U,This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long long time. A lot of unexpected laughs and crazy moments.,1380931200,,105,4.0476190476190474
5607736,1,B00BEJL69U,"I NEVER want to leave seeing a movie like WALK AWAY especially after I paid but this is just trash. Hey, Spoiler alert... its a story about friends/frenemies getting together, things happen, run around, drags out, small bursts of cool things happen like maybe 3 times & that's IT. They just talk & Bs & its mainly about friends talking & hanging out in a damn house while the world is at its end or appears to be & blah blah, Did I say...Blah already?! Hmm I still have it for rent the entire day & there's not a chance i'm ever viewing this crap again. VERY disappointed because I love Franco =(",1380931200,,596,4.283185840707965
5607757,4,B00BEJL69U,"Some films are based upon ideas so brilliant that it seems impossible for them to fail. This seems exactly the case with This is the End, and I would agree that it is far from a failure of a film, but that ingenious initial concept is also a double-edged sword as anticipating audience members may be slightly disappointed by the potential wasted. Part of the problem may also be the film's strength, with a lack of focus in filmmaking which no doubt comes from the amount of material where the stars allow vanity to take over. However self-deprecating the humor may be, they also over-estimate the audience's interest in watching nothing but these actors talk about themselves for a large portion of the film.

  The film begs one simple question: what would happen to all of the celebrities if the biblical end of days began while James Franco was having a party? The actors all play themselves in this satirical apocalypse comedy, and it seems that nobody working in Hollywood will be taken to heaven if the rapture were to occur. All of the regular members of the Judd Apatow clan are present (although he has no attachment to this project), many of which have fun playing themselves before meeting a final demise. The cast of Superbad has a coke-fueled reunion by the pool with a particularly hilarious Michael Cera, Jason Segal unenthusiastically discusses his role on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" and Martin Starr hangs out in the background. Most are only around long enough to make an appearance and die, although Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson all manage to hole up with Franco in his impressive new home.

  This is the point at which the film starts to fall apart, but also has some of the film's most humorous sequences. These six characters/actors have various grievances with each other, nearly always addressing the issue with some sort of two-faced behavior. This bickering takes up a majority of the time waiting out the apocalypse, though they also have a large quantity of drugs and a video camera to film a trailer for the sequel to a highly successful Franco/Rogen collaboration also written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who make their directorial debut with This is the End. This pair has written a number of humorous films now, but This is the End has the odd problem of trying to do too much and not doing quite enough.

  The Blu-ray release includes a DVD and digital copy, as well as a large amount of bonus footage and extras in the special features. There are many alternate takes of improvised lines, but it mostly just displays the ability of the editor to pick out the best ones. Franco and McBride's verbal sparring over the porno magazine is the highlight of these alternate takes. There are also deleted scenes and a gag reel, not to mention the short film with Baruchel and Rogen which inspired this movie. There are featurettes which include comments from the actors on playing themselves, the marketing for the film, and even a making-of for the Pineapple Express 2 trailer within the film. Rogen and Goldberg also have a feature commentary track. All but a few of these 90 minutes of extras are exclusive to the Blu-ray disc.

5607760,4,B00BEJL69U,"This Is the End was crude, vulgar, and totally hilarious. Take a group of actors playing themselves, throw them in the middle of an apocalyptic Rapture, and watch the hilarity ensue. Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel, playing themselves (or more comical versions of themselves), head to a party at James Franco's house. Michael Cera, Emma Watson, and Rihanna are just a few of the celebrities in attendance. As the party rages inside, an apocalypse rages outside. Soon, it reaches Franco's house, killing most of those in attendance and leaving a handful of survivors. They behave pretty much as we'd imagine self-absorbed celebrities to behave: getting high, being selfish, and behaving in completely clueless fashions.

The survivors get picked off one by one, and I imagine they had a lot of fun in making each death scene as gruesome as possible. There are some great cameos, including one from one of People's Sexiest Man Alive and a boy band that stages a heavenly comeback.",1380844800,,974,4.975460122699387

5607799,3,B00BEJL69U,"This is the end is about 2 friends that go to James Frasco's house for a party, shortly after an apocalypse happens.this movie is funny at times but other times,but falls flat , partly due to some bad penis jokes. this movie also puts something new to the table, a whole cast playing them selves. the acting is great. Also they did put the biblical apocalypse in this movie which i didn't think fit at all, and  it felt really weird, that's something they should of just left out, it wasn't needed. this movie is also full of great cameos which do well for their parts.another thing that was used is really cheap cgi which i think they did on purpose, it fits for this movie.

overall this movie does have some laughs, but it does have some really bad humour in it to, so all in all the humour in this is half good and half bad.

Pros:
Great Cameos
Acting
some really funny parts.

Cons:
The biblical part of this movie
awful humour, some involving penis jokes.

There were a few chuckles interspaced throughout, but no real laughs, which is a shame given the talents of this cast. It appears that the directors/producers focused more on assembling the cast instead of working on the script.

I think Danny McBride was particularly good.

I read another review stating, ""There is no way people would act like that."" Well, that's sort of the point. This is a comedy revolving around the absurd with plenty of ridiculous moments. You can't take anything in this movie seriously. Normally I think such over the top ridiculous comedies are rather mediocre, but I really enjoyed this one....right down to the Backstreet Boys ending. Maybe it was the chemistry between the actors, since they're all friends in real life. You could tell they were having a good time, and I'm sure the set was always fun.

Let me start by saying that I am a fan of both Pineapple Express and Super Bad.  I have watched both repeatedly and still laugh at the jokes.  I have enjoyed the entire cast in other movies and figured that this was a vanity project that would also have a few laughs.  Well as far as I am concerned there were more than a few laughs that did warrant my purchasing the disc rather than renting.  With that said if you are looking for a movie like Money Ball this is not the movie for you.  This is more of a Kevin Smith film in that it is not all physical comedy but a comedy controlled by the free flowing of the script and the banter between the actors.  Yes there was lots of physical humor as well but that was not the point.  The point was to get us to listen to the jokes that they were laying on each other.  It seems that they all do pay attention to all the crap written about them on the Internet but are not above making jokes of all of the public claims and theories.  I highly recommend this low brow humor to anyone who enjoys paying attention to the spoken word.,1380672000,,1191,3.9873417721518987

5607832,4,B00BEJL69U,"During the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul/dp/B005BZQVJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul</a>, Seth Rogen (as Paul) spends much of the time making the case that there is no God. During This is the End, the Book of Revelation, the apocalypse according to the Bible, is played out by Rogen and a bunch a actors playing themselves with a ton of funny cameos. Okay, the movie doesn't exactly follow Scripture, but the implication of the righteous being saved while the sinners go to Hell is loud, clear and hilariously well done.

James Franco is having a Hollywood house party. His house is full of actors that you'd expect to see in a Seth Rogen film, along with some surprises. In what initially looks like another stoner movie about...well getting stoned...things get really crazy when the ground opens up and literally all Hell breaks loose. The 6 guys on the cover of the promo on this product page are left in Franco's house, and must figure out if there is a way out of the apocalypse, and what ensues is hilariousness, silliness, scariness, decent special effectness, and of course...stonerness.

The movie earns its R rating I think mainly due to the sexual innuendo and graphic descriptions of certain acts. There's some gore, but it's mostly stuff that you might also see in a PG-13 movie these days. I was more amused throughout the movie than I thought that I'd be, and I was surprised by how well some of the scares were mixed in with the comedy, and how well some of the CGI was done.

I didn't laugh once during the entire film.  I suspect that stems from the fact that I don't find ""toilet humor"" funny.  Even though that type if humor isn't my taste I can usually overlook that and find some other redeeming quality so I can enjoy the film.  In this case I could not.

I knew going in that it was an end of the world movie so you had to suspend disbelief, but this is just a mish-mosh of scenes that does nothing but rely on toilet humor and celeb cameos.

5607990,5,B00BEJL69U,"You will not like this movie if:
-- you are religious (specifically Christian) and you don't think it's something to joke about.
-- you expect a typical movie structure with a central conflict, a three-act arc, and an identifiable protagonist/antagonist.
-- you take yourself, life, or even just movies in general too seriously.

It baffles me that some have watched this movie, knowing what it is about, and have been unsatisfied. If you understand and are interested in the basic premise, I'm not sure how you can be let down.

BASIC PREMISE: A group of actors are left behind during the Rapture and must fight to survive in a world of anarchy, demons, and general evil. Keep in mind that this is meant as a comedy. Keep in mind that these actors are playing themselves, or at least exaggerated versions of themselves. Keep in mind that these are thirty-something guys who have made a lot of money on movies featuring drugs, sex, and general gross-out goofiness.

Most of the negative reviews on this site either complain about the religious aspect (which is like a physicist complaining that THE MATRIX is a bad movie because it's not feasible to use humans to power computers) or they just say that they thought the movie featured stupid, low-brow, juvenile humor (which is like complaining about a Three Stooges short being too violent). It's really confusing how you could consider the concept and go into the theater expecting anything other than a goofy, irreverent, sprawling survival comedy.

In fact, a ton of the humor lies in the fact that these guys obviously were having a ton of fun making the film. They mock each others' bad movies, poke fun at their hedonistic lifestyles, and embrace their basically fragile vanity. ""We're just actors! We pretend we're bad a**es, but we're not!"" The old school soundtrack is also a lot of fun and is almost certainly composed of the actors' favorite songs (including a heavenly granted wish to reunite the Backstreet Boys). And there's a ton of death, destruction, and demon rape, which is something you might probably expect during Armageddon.

If you've read all of this and have even an inkling of a doubt -- say, you flinched at the phrase ""demon rape"" -- then don't sit down, watch the film, and become incensed when you don't like it. Expect a rollicking free-for-fall with actors lampooning themselves in an apocalyptic setting, and you should have a blast, because that's all the film wants to be, and it succeeds 100%.",1380067200,7,2481,4.841981132075472

5607995,1,B00BEJL69U,"I don't know where to begin. I watched this movie because many of these actors have produced works ranging from genuinely funny to moderately tolerable. But after this piece of dung covered trash I am wondering where several of these celebrities will end up. It stands as a theological and existential expression of what many in the secular world believe... or don't believe and that is what is really scary. I have to wonder how many of these actors actually hold beliefs along similar lines to that which their characters espoused. A theory not lacking in a basis for truth since they all starred as 'fictional' expressions of themselves... a dangerous line to walk. But they are all resilient right? They can handle it.

I started watching it because the trailers focus largely on the first half of the movie... something strange starts to happen and some people are swept up in the rapture and others start dying horrible deaths involving but not limited to being sucked into an abyss or flattened by cars or various machines falling from buildings... and one lamp post impalement.

From there the movie degenerates into the actual apocalypse interpretation complete with demons, devils and the like, all black and evil and sporting large male appendages. Through further degeneration the movie infers a male being raped culminating in possession... an awful biblical reference to the book of Revelations that could not be more wrong and down into the final pit involving cannibalism and more anal rape (what was Channing Tatum thinking? Did he lose a bet?)

None of the performances stand out. All of the actors debase themselves in some way or another. The humor is crude and base. The references and images and inferences get worse with each minute. you know it is bad when there is an actual giant phallic symbol as part of the furniture in Franco's house.

I am poorer and dumber for seeing this movie. I am usually able to find some element of value in a movie so that my reviews are not fully negative but in truth I could not wash the stench of this movie off me afterwards. I would ask for my money and time back but I would rather forget that my eyes and ears beheld this at all.

There is no wit, tongue in cheek, dry humor or anything enduring to an audience member with intelligence or to offer a change of pace, just stupid low-brow comedy shock porn.

5608038,5,B00BEJL69U,"This is a ""review"" for people that have not yet seen the film and are reading through all of these reviews to see if they would like to purchase it.

I would like to start this off by recommending that you rent this film prior to purchasing it. I really enjoyed the movie, but it does tread on some ground that is bound to make a number of people uncomfortable or downright angry with it. So, save yourself the $25 and rent it from your local redbox or movie rental place. If you like it enough to buy it after seeing it once then go for it. At the very least, watch the trailer and you'll get a good idea what to expect. If you don't like the trailer then you'll probably feel the same way about the movie as a whole.

With that said, I would also recommend NOT reading the reviews of the movie before you watch it (doh! I guess you have already done what you shouldn't by reading this review!). There are a number of reviews on this site that have some pretty substantial spoilers. The reviewers most likely had good intentions (you know, I hate this movie so I will tell you exactly why.. even if it is a bit of a spoiler. Or, I loved this movie and this scene was awesome because..), but they take away from the experience by going into the nuances of the movie and explaining why it was so horrible.

I have read many reviews on here stating that ""all of the good parts were in the trailer... etc."" I'd like to mention that many of the scenes from the trailer were outtakes. Yep. They're not actually in the movie. Some are similar, and some are scenes from the film, but many of them are outtakes. So, don't worry about that.

Rather than reading through the dozens of spoilers on Amazon, just take a look at the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and you'll see that a majority of the people that went to see it enjoyed it. However, the Amazonians should be a good indication that there are people that dislike the film, and will be very vocal about it.

Actual review:
This film is right along the lines of pineapple express. If you liked that film than this one will probably bring some smiles to your face. I enjoyed the acting, script, and the way that the overall movie played out. However, just like pineapple express this movie will be split by people that love it and people that hate it. Personally, I did not see any deviation from what you would expect from the group of actors involved in this film. If you know their personalities then you'll get to see some fairly overly exaggerated versions of them that often lead to some really funny stuff.

I have read some reviews on Amazon from people that claimed that they loved all of the actors in every one of their previous movie, but hated them in this one because they were ""Sophomoric."" This is ridiculous. The writing for this was well done and the humor is exactly what you expect. It was maybe a little bit more in your face and grungy than normal, but not really out of the realm of things that they have already performed in the past.

Acting 9/10
It's pretty much what I had expected. It's entertaining and they're all willing to go pretty overboard while representing themselves.
Story 9/10
I think the story is pretty great. I enjoyed the film enough that I've watched it 3 times, now. While it's not a deep and insightful story, there were parts that you appreciate more your second time around.
Filming 9/10
This is a bit.. unreal at times. However, it was pretty obviously meant to be that way and is pretty great a majority of the time.
Characters 10/10
I got a kick out of their interactions with one another.

As I said at the beginning of the review, I would recommend renting it to get some sort of idea about what you might be purchasing.

Update: 10/09/2013
I'm a little bit surprised to see a few people marking this as unhelpful. If you have an issue with it then please leave a comment and I will be happy to respond and take your critique into consideration. However, if you are trying to find a review to justify purchasing this movie then that's a weird concept to me and I'm really not sure why you're looking on Amazon for it. If you have already seen the movie, then you know if you want to buy it and you're not the target audience for this review anyways. If you have not seen the movie and are unwilling to spend $2 renting it (or waiting 2 days for Netflix to deliver it to your door) then why are you looking at reviews and considering spending $25 on Amazon?",1379894400,,4536,4.363744075829384

5608043,5,B00BEJL69U,"As you can see with the reviews, people either love or hate this movie.  It is definitely not for those who have 'limits' to what they think is funny.  This movie includes Jonah Hill getting raped by Satan.  (enough said?)  That also leads to an exorcism on him by the rest of the main cast that may be one of the funniest moments in any movie I've seen in a long, long time.

Some of the negative reviews here complained that this was a ""lazy"" attempt by the writers because all the characters played themselves.  Don't listen to those reviews because obviously they don't get it.  That's what makes this movie so unique and wonderful.... the fact that this is these real guys and how they deal with the end of the world.  It is so well done, I was amazed and impressed beyond what I expected.  While some may be disappointed with Seth Rogan's attempt here, I think it establishes him as one of the very great comedy writers and directors.  The idea of playing themselves works wonderfully and the movie wouldn't be nearly as good with them just playing fictional characters.  It's amazing how some people miss this completely.

It won't be for everyone, but if you think seeing James Franco having a screaming match with his friend about jizzing all over the only porn magazine they have left for eternity is funny, then you need to see this movie.  I'm 60 years old, not exactly in the youth target market, but this is one of the best comedy movies I've seen.  It's ""push the envelope"" funny.",1379808000,,1495,4.5092936802973975

It was much worse that I expected, all the best parts were in the trailer. The remainder of the movie seemed designed to see how uncomfortable they could make the viewers. I couldn't call it entertaining. I endured it because I was with someone and didn't want to force them to leave.

The premise is actually good. Self-centered actors with no real survival skills trying to survive the end of the world. But after the idea, the delivery consisted of insults, sex jokes, and sight gags that might be hilarious to a12 year old, but I didn't find it funny or compelling. Like I said, my expectations were pretty low, but the movie failed to live up to them.

5608098,1,B00BEJL69U,"If you take nothing else from this review, take this: Don't buy this movie.

The plot of this movie is a bunch of celebrities go to a celebrity party, and during the party, the rapture happens. After a while they realize they have to do something good to get into heaven. However the plot is so thin and weak, that doesn't add anything to the movie. On its own, the banter between the characters is actually entertaining at times, but here's the thing. It's lazy. Supremely lazy. Seth Rogen and his buds, too lazy to even don characters other than themselves, use James Fraco's house (pictured in 95% of all the scenes), hired a poor animation team for some demons and explosions, and ride a wave of celebrities to give the impression that the move is anything other than self indulgent garbage. Apparently it seems to work though because everyone (myself included) got duped into watching it. The horror that I sat through this pointless, barely funny movie and contributed to these people for such lazy, half-assed work makes me cringe. If this is where cinema is going, God help us all.",1379635200,7,1089,4.671875
5608099,5,B00BEJL69U,"I've seen this twice in theaters, the only time I've willingly done this. I never liked Pineapple Express. I like Craig Robinson. Jonah Hill .. not so much. James Franco, not at all.

HOWEVER, I love this kind of comedy. Just over the top ridiculousness with the cast having great chemistry. If you like raunchy and ridiculous humor you'll love this. You can tell most of the film was just people making it up as they go along. The celebrity cameos are hilarious, the plot is actually interesting, and underneath all the comedy there are dark tones of despair.. The world is ending all around you, people are dying from creatures unseen, and you're trapped with little-to-no food in a house with a bunch of panicky starving people.

What shocked me the most, however, were the special effects. When you start hitting the climax of the film you'll see what I mean. These aren't the kind of effects you'd expect in this sort of comedy - monstrous giant detailed creatures.

All in all, if you're a college student or just like Seth Rogen and his posse, you'll be extremely happy you watched this. Then again, you'd also probably have watched this in theaters so there's no point to this review haha.",1379635200,2,1197,4.6635071090047395

I absolutely loved this movie from start to finish. I am a person who is hard to make laugh but the fact that this movie had me smiling from beginning to end, says something for the work that was put into this far out story. Well I for one loved this movie I could understand why some people had a hard time digesting it. Some comedy is ""too much"" for some people but I say to hell with it, its all in good spirit. Going into this and seeing names like Franco, Rogen, Hill, etc you should automatically know your not getting Oz:The great and powerful 2. Instead your getting a rated R comedy that works hard to make sure it deserves that rating!

 The plot is beyond simple of our main cast attending a party at James Francos house, while on the day of the rapture. As soon as blue beams take people up to heaven and the ground opens up, thats when the laughs begin! From that point on its a tale of survival from these egotistical, exaggerated, caricatures that our cast portray. I don't wanna even explain more about this movie as its that much better going into it and not knowing what the hell is going to happen. Points by the way if you spot the Rosemarys Baby reference towards the third act of the film! Had me dying even though I was the only one in my theater who got it.

Together the two engage in recreational activities (like video-gaming while stoned) before going to a party at James Franco's (as James Franco) house. While running an errand, Rogen and Baruchel see the beginning of the end and from there engage in a survival of the fittest with a bunch of other recognizable faces from other Rogen movies. There are many 4th-wall breaking moments too precious to spoil here! It's crude, vulgar, gory (yes, gory), and downright exploitative at times. Some people, like Michael Cera, have roles that need to be seen to be believed. It's a wildly ridiculous premise with some segments that go on a wee bit too long without a laugh. As a film experience, I give it a 3.75/5 or so, which would round it up to a 4 on Amazon's scale. Definitely worth a watch, even better with company!",1373673600,4,1131,4.835051546391752

Okay, I saw this in the theater a few days ago and here is my view on things...

I haven't seen many films but it seems like the script was thrown together over a drunk weekend. But, from what I've been told, these actors seem to make movies together and that is how they ""roll""

The script isn't a new one but they seem to pull it off and makes the audience wonder what exactly is going on. I personally thought it was aliens what were abducting people but when he started talking about the bible, I put it all together. He doesn't seem to get much right but I guess that was the intended purpose. We go through a lot of dialogue with a bunch of it way ""over the top"" (too vulgar to say on here but anyone that's seen the movie would get it) One scene that was funny was when the girl with the Axe was going to get some sleep and the guys were joking around about which one of them (the guys) they will rape first...she overhears and gets out of the house.

Okay, from start to finish......The party and the scenes were very funny. the ""obnoxious"" guy with the two girls was....not. Taking a look at the scenes with the fires all over and the pit that swallows up most of the party goers (who none of them get ""raptured"" isn't really surprising...lol) was funny to watch, yet, sad to see.

When their other friend shows up and eats their food (you know, the ignorant one), I could see the situation for these guys to be going downhill fast. They fight, fight, fight until he leaves, only to reappear as the demonic carnivore. The premise of how the guys get ""raptured"" for doing ""good"" deeds is very cheesy and over the top. They witness demonic flying creatures, chimera (I think) and one demon who sneaks into one of their room with a 5 foot long...well.....umm.....never mind. (another example of over the top humor)

Well (without giving the movie away) some of them get raptured (one gets raptured but was arrogant..thus wasn't....and gets eaten) some just die from various things. But, overall, at the end when you see 1,000 foot tall Satan and his ""package"" (something I did not want to see) and they get away, I knew that the movie was most likely over.

Overall, this movie will most likely turn away anyone remotely ""religious"" and send them out of the house screaming ""Blasphemer"" and running to get holy water to get out the demon that is in pocession of the person's body (oh, the homage to the horror classic was well done)

A little too vulgar for me to give it 5 stars. Enough of a plot and twists and turns to get three.....",1373587200,4,2576,4.394957983193278

Yes, it's crazy, outlandish and ""out there"" but it's original, hilarious and did I say hilarious?  Yes, there's always some crude stuff in these kind of movies but it comes with the territory, but I sure as hell wasn't expecting it to be funny pretty much all the way through.  I'm used to movies being funny in certain parts and not so funny in others.

When the end of the world happened, the film shifted in cliche mode with trite humor on the pretentious side. There were a few funny parts such as their treatment of Michael Cera and Channing Tatum. This was not enough to carry the film which was mostly shot inside one house.

There were certainly more jokes and movie references that could have been exploited. They did well when they ""roasted"" each other on their performances. The Exorcism scene was rank amateur.

5608171,2,B00BEJL69U,"Walked out of two movies in the course of my life; this was the second. A few thoughts.

Idea for a movie: the world comes  to an end and a bunch of actor friends are partying when it happens. We'll make the rest up as we go along, just have these really great comic minds stand around and make up dialog and brainstorm self-referential funny stuff that could happen. If nothing funny comes to mind, they'll overact, and drop the F-bomb. A lot.

Note to  professional reviewers (84% at Rotten Tomatoes?!): you have defrauded us and lost my trust forever. I know it's boring work, sitting through hours and hours of the dreck floating your way, but you wanted the job. And you are not there for your own entertainment, remember. Originality is overrated in the creative process. A film has to EXECUTE, not just follow the undisciplined wanderings of an addled mind.

Note to young marijuana users in Hollywood: Smoking weed, per se, is funny WHEN you are smoking weed. Smoking weed, per se, might evoke humorous MEMORIES to those who have smoked a lot of weed. To the rest of us, not so much.

Note to screenwriters: For the umpteenth time, the last book of the Bible is called ""Revelation,"" not ""Revelations."" And don't just invent content from the Bible in order to fit your narrative. Some of us still read. Some of us even consider it Holy Writ.

This is the end, indeed--an  indicator of where our culture is. Not dead, yet.

Synopsis:  Jay Baruchel leaves Canada to visit Canadian ex-pat Seth Rogen in Los Angeles for a little rest and relaxation.  Rogan drags Barchuel to a party that's hosted by James Franco and attended by Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and many others (to Barchuel's dismay, as he was hoping to spend a quiet evening in with Rogen.)  As the duo goes out to pick up additional party supplies, a mysterious blue light starts taking people away while those who haven't been absorbed become at risk for comedically horrific deaths.  Though no one at the party initially believes them, they start to once the carnage begins taking place at Franco's door step.  With no where to go and no one to turn to, it's up to the group to find a way to survive amongst the limited rations they have and the constant personality clashes they endure with each other.  Will they survive, or will they become victims of the apocalypse?  Will any of them be ""saved"", or will they too perish horrifically?  Guess appearances are made by Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Aziz Ansari, Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, Kevin Hart, The Backstreet Boys, and many, many more.

Though the humor's crude, it's still there, and while those who are a bit more prudent with their humor may be offended, others will have laugh out loud moments at the follies the crew goes through.

  To enjoy this movie, you have to have liked other movies written by Seth Rogen and know what you're getting into. So you have to be ready for drug use, guys talking gay to each other and a lot of vulgarity.

I laughed more than he did. I laughed so much, he kept squeezing my hand to try to shut me up.

Of course, it's their typical stoner movie but you throw in their original idea based off the short film Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse and it becomes this cult classic about actors playing themselves, willing to make fun of themselves when the world is coming to an end.

Not exact quotes, but pretty close:
""Hey. Seth Rogen. You play the same role in every movie.""
""At least that was better than your performance in The Green Hornet.""

As actors, such as James Franco, they believe they've done no wrong and deserve to be taken to Heaven. This movie takes them on an adventure to learn otherwise.

If you've any doubts, follow this list of movie ingredients:

1. Lots of ridiculous, outrageous gags
2. Tons of stars playing fictional versions of themselves
3. Many self-referential digs at themselves and each other
4. Swearing, vulgarity, profanity, and explicit male nudity
5. Sacrilegious humor

Don't come here if you're looking for anything resembling a traditional Hollywood movie. As you've probably gathered by now, the plot concerns what is pretty much the End of the World, and how a small group of celebrity idiots hope to survive it, but we're not talking about anything approaching good common sense.

But let this be a warning: there's one particularly jarring moment in this movie that rivals anything delivered by well-constructed horror movies.  You'll know you've reached it when the audience screams aloud and then has to look around for the seats they just leaped out of.

I enjoyed the heck out of this film, and if you like this crowd, you should, too. It should be another sizeable box-office bonanza for a group of anti-Hollywood filmmakers who do practically everything wrong when it comes to conventional Hollywood wisdom, but they just seem to turn out hit after hit.

The first is Emma Watson, who plays a kick-ass Emma Watson in the movie, bloodying Seth Rogen's nose before taking off with his food supply.  And then there's the end where we learn that Heaven is essentially one eternal Club Med vacation, with everyone dressed in white and the Backstreet Boys as the official band.  Finally, there's the fact that a lot of annoying Hollywood celebrities die in the movie, and they die pretty gruesome deaths.

The rest of the movie -- all two hours of it -- suck.  This is essentially a slacker movie made by slackers for slackers.  In this movie, the actors play themselves because they can't be bothered to act, and they speak as though they were high on drugs all the time because the writers couldn't be bothered to write or the actors couldn't be bothered to memorize their lines (probably both).

5608212,5,B00BEJL69U,"In all of its crudity, it was just funny.

Not that I'm recommending it for everyone, because I know a lot of people are offended by this type of humor, and This Is The End takes it to Kevin Smith levels of crude and, probably, even beyond. Really, you have to see it to know what I'm talking to about, because I can't talk about it without spoilers.

First thing, you really need to have seen Pineapple Express to get some of the jokes in This Is The End. In a lot of ways, TITE is the real life sequel of Pineapple. So, if you've seen Pineapple and liked it, you'll probably like TITE. If you didn't like Pineapple, you definitely shouldn't bother with TITE.

The idea is that the end of the world is happening and a group of friends are hiding out together. Let me say that again: a group of ""friends"" are hiding out together to escape the end of the world. Except one of the guys (Jay Baruchel) really doesn't like any of the other people, and none of them really like one of the guys (Danny McBride), especially since he (McBride) wastes half of their food on the first day. It's one of those ""what would happen if you were locked up with your best friends"" kind of scenarios. How long would you maintain?

And it all starts with a party where no one notices that the end of the world is happening, which is a joke in-and-of itself and pretty priceless, if you ask me. The Emma Watson's bit (which is shown in the trailer), because she's at the party, too, is hilarious. As is Michael Cera.

The thing about a movie like this is that the cast, who all play themselves, really has to be able to make fun of themselves. Parody themselves. Make all the things we think about them larger than life whether those things are true or not. And who knows how much of any of it is true other than those guys, but they were brilliant at it in this film. Especially James Franco. I don't care what people say about him, I'm convinced the man is one of the smartest actors in Hollywood. Hmm... that may not be saying much, so let me say he's just pretty freaking smart.

The best part, though, is the writing. What you expect is just some pretty straightforward crude humor, and it's full of that. I mean, the f*(& count is pretty high (did you know that wikipedia has an entry for the movies with the highest uses of that word? I do, now). However, there's some pretty complex and subtle writing going on, too, which is pretty awesome if you can see it under all of the other depravity of the movie. But, again, I can't talk about it without giving it away.

So, here at the end, let me just say that if you like this kind of humor, even if it's a guilty pleasure kind of thing, then you should go see this movie. Or, at the very least, plan to rent it. You know, as long as the End doesn't come beforehand...",1372032000,7,2802,4.235955056179775
5608213,3,B00BEJL69U,"I attended this movie at my local theater.

This film has a few moments of fun.  But most of the film portrays a group of younger guys acting raunchy and stupid.

The film is well acted, directed, and with good camera work.  The story/script appears to be focused at a teenage audience that enjoys raunchy ""humor""; although there were very few laughs throughout the audience.  The male members of the cast behaved uniformly stupid; while the single really interesting role was played by Emma Watson, who played a ""has-it-together"" character.

The story is about what happens at a pot head's party when the apocalypse takes place.  Predictably, the party goers behave without even an ounce of brain cells.

The film is, for the most part, boring.  But if you're young and enjoy raunchy humor, then you may like it.

A waste of money for those with a brain . . .

This so-called `movie', after entering the theater, is compulsory verbal pornography (to be polite). The `R' rating of this should be `XXX' (or higher).

The visual pornography is massive but somewhat less than the verbal sewage spewed over the audience.

The script is of the quality of a high school dropout who flunked English because of inability to produce educated verbiage (that could accomplish the same thing as the verbal sewage in this juvenile movie) but was paid by a financial donor to insult and degrade humanity.

It did have a Friend story line - at least something of value. The world ending, per biblical Revelation, was at another least something of a plot (the most of the evil monsters having their privates visually displayed (a classy movie enhancement!)). The one, where out of the blue, for no particular reason, a monster somehow gets into the safe house, without being noticed, with an visibly enlarged reproductive organ, somehow impregnates the male Jonah (a brilliant realism).

Direct, and by innuendo, male sexual activities `must be propelled upon!' audiences by lowly evolved juvenile male movie characters. I am not a woman but can imagine a woman of reasonable intelligence would think of this piece of Hollywood trash demeaning to them as well.

More audience pounding is the drug use, another Hollywood social enhancement for younger adults, viewing this abject refuse. An enrichment society needs in Hollywood's continuing downward spiral - thank you!

If those, in the audience, were in high school, or a tiny bit older, perhaps they laughed at the lowly, pathetic, sexual humor contrivances in this movie.

The only thing of interest, at all, I found was the actor's real names were used (and why not?).

The movie, outside the `friend' story line, was not funny, not laughable, insulting, demeaning and degrading. I am sure there are similar wretched, low life, movies out there I haven't seen (thank God) but this is the worst movie I have ever seen, in my entire life.

This is the End is another example of pseudo-reality entertainment in the style of Curb Your Enthusiasm, where actors play versions of themselves albeit sometimes deeply ironic versions of themselves; I'm talking to you, Michael Cera - at least I hope I am!  Seth Rogan wrote and directed this film along with his partner, Evan Goldberg, and the film clearly benefits from having someone so close to the actors involved with all parts of the production.

This is the End opens simply enough with Seth Rogan meeting his friend Jay Baruchel at the airport.  They plan to hang out in LA and eventually end up heading to James Franco's new house for a big house-warming party.  The opening act of this film is a cameo-filled (Emma Watson, Rhianna, and Paul Rudd to name a few) laugh fest that just piles on the humor in ways that a big-screen comedy hasn't done since The Hangover in 2009.  The comedy is not just name-dropping cheap laughs though.  Rogan and Franco along with Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel have permeated their way into celebrity in such a way that they can satirize the entertainment business through self-referential humor.  Rogan has written a screenplay that characteristically paints his characters as corrupted in one way or another by the entertainment industry, and this biting satire plays out far beyond the opening act.

Rogan also makes a series of wise choices as both a writer and a director that keep this film from quickly growing stale.  Most notably is his decision to play the rest of the film as a true disaster film.  Once the inevitable apocalypse begins, it is not treated as a joke to introduce more absurdity.  Instead, it is used as a backdrop of real danger designed to continue the motif of contempt that has built up in the characters.  That is not to say the laughs stop coming - that is in no way true.  However, the balance of humor and real danger keep the film fresh and alive.

The apocalypse that hits is quickly discovered to be a literal onset of the Book of Revelations complete with the Rapture and the arrival of Satan on Earth.  Such high stakes force the boys to hole up in Franco's house along with Craig Robertson and Danny McBride.  Irreverent humor abounds with some of the meanest, nastiest, low-brow, toilet humor imaginable - all of it hilarious.  Occasionally, the film hits a slight snag in terms of pacing and some of the gross-out humor is tasteless and extreme, but it is hardly at the film's detriment.  The film has a little bit of something for everyone; in fact, even fans of The Backstreet Boys owe this film a tremendous debt of gratitude for preserving a shred of their relevance in cinematic history.

Rogan and company have truly tapped into a genre of humor that grows along with them.  In one scene, they try to kill boredom by filming crude home-movie versions of sequels of their own films.  Somebody get to work on this exact version of Pineapple Express 2 immediately!  In fact, This is the End would be a great exclamation point at the end of the ""end of the world"" movie fad that has been so commonly explored in entertainment lately.  However, with World War Z, The World's End, and Elysium still to come this summer along with fall's second installment of The Hunger Games series, it's clear that we are far from done with this genre.  A-

This is the End is rated R - very, very, very R - and has a running time of 1 hour and 59 minutes.  It is heavy on the raunch, and while I highly recommend it as a comedy, it is not for the easily offended.",1371686400,2,3813,4.488405797101449
5608239,5,B00BEJL69U,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

It's a party at Franco's house and everybody's invited! No, I'm being serious. If you pick a comedian at random there's a pretty good chance they're in here. Unfortunately, halfway through the party there's this huge earthquake, a giant sinkhole, and a good chunk of the cast dies. If anything, this is my biggest complaint with This Is The End. I would have loved to have seen some interaction beyond the six main ""characters"". For example, I was so happy when I saw Jason Segel, but I don't remember him having more than one line of dialogue and Paul Rudd came and went in a matter of 90 seconds. The disappointment stops there, however, because from that point on This Is The End is a non-stop laugh fest that has you fighting to control your bladder.

While This Is The End is going to attract a lot of attention from its extensive cast of actors (which include the likes of Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Aziz Ansari, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse), its main focus is on the six men who seem to have all been in a movie together at some point in time. You follow Seth Rogen, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and Danny McBride who all play some exaggerated version of themselves. The world is ending and the apocalypse is here. This is kind of the glue that holds the film together because the main story is about Rogen and Baruchel's ""struggling"" relationship.

Most of the movie is spent in Franco's new house, which he deems ""the fort"". Because you have six grown men stuck in a house together with limited resources, tempers start to flare. Things get said and the truth comes out. This is where the meat of the comedy is found. The banter between these six comedians as they continue to bash one another is nothing short of magical. Danny McBride is probably the most ruthless of the six as he appears to ""hate"" every single person in the house. Jonah's over-the-top kindness never stopped being funny and I couldn't help but laugh every time I saw Craig's ""Take Yo Panties Off!"" shirt.

With the comedy comes some unexpected suspense, however, and that's when the theater became dead quiet. Because we've entered the apocalypse demons are roaming around the city and each one is packing a gigantic penis. There's no avoiding its gaze as Goldberg and Rogen make it a point to zoom in on its monstrous size. There's only one really intense scene with Robinson and Baruchel, but, for me, it really killed the flow of the film. We were given joke after joke after joke and then boom! I've never seen a theater become so quiet so quick. While it made sense given the context of the film, I still feel like This Is The End wouldn't have suffered without it.

Another thing that kind of threw me off was the hefty amount of religious talk scattered throughout the movie. From the start Baruchel sees this as our ""judgement day"" because he saw people being sucked up into the sky by blue beams of light. I assumed it would stop there and they would take a different approach to the whole ""end of the world"" theme, but I was wrong. Baruchel continues to back his statements and we slowly start to learn that he was correct in his assumption. For those of you who aren't religious or aren't Christian, don't fret. While they are using the bible as a way to smooth out the rough edges of the story, it's merely there to provide a message: Be nice to people and try to put the needs of others above your own. You don't need to believe in God to understand that basic concept, but it's still something that seems long forgotten in today's world.

Finally, the visual effects in this movie are fantastic for a comedy film. While each demon has your run-of-the-mill design, they're all given an extreme amount of detail. If you're a comedy enthusiast you're going to be impressed by what you see here. Usually comedy films don't have huge budgets, so when one wants to include CGI of some sort it usually looks terrible. This Is The End completely destroys that trend and made it clear that comedy films deserve to be just as creative as your big-budget Sci-Fi action films.

Overall Score: 9/10 - I was really surprised at just how much I enjoyed this movie. I had some high expectations given its cast and I wasn't disappointed. From start to finish the comedy was non-stop and I even had tears streaming down my face during some sequences. What makes it so great is the fact that it's so ruthless and confident in its delivery, which makes it so easy to fall in love with. If you're a fan of Rogen and his posse of friends then you should definitely see this. This Is The End is truly one of the best comedies I've seen in years and I can't wait to see it again.",1371513600,2,4729,4.523976608187135
5608240,5,B00BEJL69U,"Awesome movie, definitley not what I was expecting when I walked into the theatre. I won't spoil anything about it, just know to go in with an open mind and an urge to be entertained. The movie does hit on religion a lot, but honestly; not in a bad way. They could've made it offensive but they never went in that direction too hard. As a fellow Christian, I just loved this movie and concept. Also, if you've seen Pineapple Express, Superbad, Your Highness, 127 Hours, etc; you'll enjoy the film that much more for all its refrences. All you need to do is stay calm, realize this is a movie, and enjoy. Better than the always overrated (original)Hangover, and you won't find a funnier movie out right now, or for 2013 so far.",1371513600,3,726,4.425373134328358
5608241,5,B00BEJL69U,"Oh really! Whoa! This movie was a blast to watch. It was so funny and laugh for the whole movie. It really showed that the writers and director tried really hard to make this movie AWESOME!!! They assembled an all star cast and all of them really did a great job playing their roles. There were a few things that I didn't like that much, but it didn't overshadow the movie and this movie does get 5 stars, since for a long time I haven't such a great comedy like this. I'm going to buy it when it comes to DVD. I do recommend this movie.",1371513600,2,537,4.0754716981132075
5608242,4,B00BEJL69U,"One of the great things about THIS IS THE END is the concept.  It's a bit obnoxious...but it's also really darn clever.  An ""end of the world"" movie starring actors like Seth Rogan, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, James Franco & Craig Robinson PLAYING THEMSELVES!  These actors and a number of their Hollywood friends (Danny McBride, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd, Aziz Ansari and most randomly Rihanna and Emma Watson) all assemble at a party at James Franco's house just when all hell literally breaks loose.  True, it sounds a bit self-important and self-indulgent...but who cares when the results are as obscene and hilarious at it all turns out.

This end of the world scenario involves the biblical apocalypse, and it all starts with the rapture, as people all around are suddenly drawn up to the skies by heavenly tractor beams.  This is witnessed by Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogan...and they run back to the raucous house party only to discover that NO ONE has been raptured from amongst these Hollywood partiers.  That alone is pretty hilarious.

As the scenario plays out, horrible things happen to many of the stars until only a few are left to ride out the end, trapped in Franco's house with a woefully under-stocked pantry.  The ""plot"" of the film isn't terribly important, to be honest...the fun is in watching these guys play versions of themselves that are HIGHLY unflattering, and yet not necessarily so far off the mark to be totally unbelievable (although I sure hope Michael Cera is NOTHING like his character in the film...absolutely disturbing and hilarious).  Seth Rogan has some fun riffing on the idea that he plays the same character in all his films.  Baruchel HATES all these guys.  Jonah Hill comes off as effete and creepy.  (And Emma Watson gets to drop some f-bombs and endure some funny Hermione jokes.)  And James Franco is looser than he's been in awhile...reminding us of why he became such a big start in recent years.

It's a sloppy film that feels like it was LOADS of fun to make.  The laughs are frequent (and frequently around some pretty R-rated material...this film is not for delicate constitutions).  The budget is high enough to allow for some pretty amusing sight gags.  The jokes and insults fly fast...this is certainly a movie that will reward a repeat viewing, as there is no way to catch everything the first time.  And yet, as is often the case with Seth Rogan related comedies, the film has a heart as well.  I'm not going to say it's ""moving""...but it has moments of redemption which is important, because I think the film might come off as too mean-spirited without them.  We need the ""soft"" moments to take off the edge.  This tendency is what has made movies like KNOCKED UP or SUPERBAD into classics...the fact that underneath the edgy, foul-mouthed, ""screw it all"" attitude is some old-fashioned feeling.

THIS IS THE END doesn't always work.  The jokes and bits come so frequently that some of them must misfire.  Danny McBride and James Franco have a lengthy scene together in which they discuss...well, let's just say it involves McBride's self-abuse proclivities...and it goes on for too long.  It's funny at first, but then just crosses the line.  This is a film that really tries hard to come up to the line over and over...sometimes it crosses over with crassness and sometimes just by letting the jokes go on a few beats too long.  But it HITS far more than it misses.

THIS IS THE END is VERY funny and very offensive (in the best possible way).  It is deeply politically incorrect (yea!).  It is certainly not for everyone.  If you like the group of actors mentioned and the films referenced, it should please you immensely.  But if you've seen 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and hated it and wondered what the fuss was about...it's unlikely you'd want to spend your time with this film.  I really enjoyed it myself, and certainly would highly recommend it to the RIGHT group of friends.",1371427200,88,3932,4.7507374631268435
5608243,5,B00BEJL69U,"Over the course of film history, we've seen some masterful comedy teams grace the big screen.  Legendary actors, like The Three Stooges, Cheech & Chong, and Chris Farley & David Spade have set the bar for comedy, paving the way for the current generation.  The odds of modern comedy acts ever making us laugh as much as the classics is slim to none, but that doesn't necessarily mean the genre has gone stale.  Enter: Seth Rogan.  After his supporting role in The 40 Year Old Virgin, Seth Rogan burst on the scene, quickly collecting key roles in Knocked Up and Superbad - thrusting him ever farther into the Hollywood spotlight.  Rogan currently dangles in the world of acting, producing, writing, and now directing - sharing the role with Evan Goldberg on the new comedy, This Is The End.

Based on the short film Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse, This Is The End stars Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Jay Baruchel as themselves in a fictional world.  Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles and Seth Rogan takes him to James Franco's housewarming party, but the party is interrupted when chaos ensues, along with blue lights ""rapturing"" individuals to heaven - leaving Rogan and his cohorts behind to live in a world filled with hellfire and brimstone.  Holed-up in Franco's house, Danny McBride enters the fray, causing bedlam in the house.  Baruchel, Rogan, Franco, Hill, and McBride must figure out a way to survive in a world filled with demons, and a lack of rations.  Emma Watson, Jason Segel, Rihanna, and Mindy Kaling also star in supporting roles as fictional versions of themselves.

In the beginning, it's difficult to warm up to this film, mostly because it's just a bunch of celebrities sitting in a room getting high and bickering about pointless things.  Once the earthquakes begin and the chaos commences, this is a relatively flawless comedy.  Seth Rogan, Johah Hill, and the rest of the main cast are secluded in James Franco's swanky new house and are relentless with ""the funny.""  Danny McBride shows up and wipes out the group's rations of food and water, thus creating the major predicament for the entirety of the story.  The fact that the story portrays these individuals as themselves is quite genius idea and entertaining, as they continuously make jokes about one another, also reference the work they've done with one another on previous films, including the popular comedy, Pineapple Express.

For the fans of Pineapple Express, This Is The End will be a treat. With the success of Pineapple Express, fans have been clamoring for a sequel, and even though there has been talk and rumors about a sequel being made, it has yet to come to fruition. This Is The End gives a slight taste of what it could have been or could be in the future and plays off the real-life friendships between Rogan & Franco, building off their chemistry from Pineapple Express.  Franco and Rogan speak highly of the idea for making a sequel, making several references to the possibility.  Due to the circumstances of the Armageddon, the duo decide to create the Pineapple sequel at Franco's house (filmed using a camcorder with die-cast vehicles as props) - giving away one of their ideas for the sequel.  In any event, it's great to see the wheels are still turning for the future of Pineapple Express 2.

Obviously, since the majority of the film takes place in one house, the time has to be filled with enough entertaining shenanigans to progress the story to the point of a viable conclusion.  Prior to the arrival of Danny McBride, the characters severely lack major conflict.  Aside from their petty personal quips with one another, these characters often spend their time being rational and getting along with one another.  McBride brings the character conflict, not to mention the endless array of humorous situations.  Aside from McBride's contributions, the major comedy comes from the video confessionals (in all its Jersey Shore-like glory), followed by one extremely entertaining, yet slightly bothersome demon possession of Jonah Hill.  As himself, Jonah Hill is rather bland and un-amusing, at least until he's visited in his sleep by this rather ambitious devil-like creature.

Overall, This Is The End is unlike the majority of comedy films currently out there, combining some of the funniest actors in Hollywood as themselves.  The film is full of puns, profanity, and everything else that has made Seth Rogan and company the sensation they are today.  When it comes to a recommendation, This Is The End is on the fence - mainly because of the content involved.  Teenagers will eat this film up for its party antics and sexual references, but at the same time, it's a completely male-driven film.  Emma Watson and Rihanna appear, but are here and gone before you know it - thus creating a large void in the female presence category.  In any event, This Is The End is still a superb film, filled with quirky humor, a passionate cast, and a long list of Hollywood cameos that will have you laughing out loud for minutes on end.  If you're a lover of crude humor and not easily offended, This Is The End has the potential to be your next favorite comedy.  In fact, This Is The End is so funny, it might leave you with to urge to go wait in line and see it again.  It is - without a shadow of a doubt - the must see comedy of 2013.

5608244,5,B00BEJL69U,"AWESOME!!! This movie is insanely good. I actually thought Man of Steel (which it also is) would be the movie I want to see more than once. But This Is the End is worthy of multiple viewings as well. How in the world I should start my review of this movie is one for the ages. Here it goes.

This Is The End Stars: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny Mcbride, Craig Robinson, and Jay Baruchel (really awesome guy from How To Train Your Dragon). These guys have such great chemistry and such senseless humor that its almost unfair to other actors. We also have great cameos from Rihanna(hahaahaha no comment), Michael Cera (hilarious in this one), Kevin Hart, Emma Watson, and yes, even Channing Tatum. The supporting cast was great. The funny thing is the story. The Characters are actually playing themselves in the movie. To spoil or not to spoil, Two best friends go to James Franco's house where there is a party and suddenly there is a catastrophe, thus we have a movie that is wildly humorous and surprisingly more entertaining than I thought it would be. I enjoyed This is the End a lot more than I expected to.
Without any doubts and one of the biggest smiles on my face in a long time, I gladly give This Is The End

5608245,5,B00BEJL69U,"This movie was exactly what I expected and more. Filling it with dirty jokes, weed, cameos, the apocalypse, religion, demonic possession, and much more. The idea and plot of actors playing themselves is unique and fresh. During a party at James Franco's house, the world begins to crumble. Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and James Franco all try to survive the apocalypse, and most importantly, try to survive from each other. From making a home-made sequel to 'The Pineapple Express' to getting high and listening to that ridiculous Gangnam Style song, this movie has a little bit of everything.

5608247,4,B00BEJL69U,"""This Is The End"" (2013 release; 106 min. ) brings yet another take on ""the end of the world"" after such recent movies like ""Melancholia"" (in 2011) and ""Seeking a Friend For the End of the World"" (in 2012). The basic premise of ""This Is the End"" is very simple: take a bunch of Hollywood stars playing a (supposed) fictionlized version of themselves, let the world come to an end, and let's see what happens!

Several comments: going into the movie, I didn't know a whole lot about it, and in particular whether this was supposed to be funny, serious, scary, and/or more than that. I think co-writers/co-directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were debating the same issue while developing the movie, as in the first 45 min. of the movie, the movie truly is all over the place. But eventually it becomes clear that this is tilting heavily towards comedy and indeed the last hour of the movie are pretty much rip-roaring. When the situation around you has become so desparate, Rogen and Goldberg have concluded that there is only one way to deal with it: laugh at the absurdity of it all. That leads to some truly hilarious scenes, such as when the group of 6 (Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, James Franco and Craig Robinson) are holed up in Franco's house and out of boredom they decide to make up a sequel to Pineapple Express starring themselves and with various props. After they watch the final product (called ""Pineapple Express 2: Blood Red""), Rogen comments dryly ""that was great, we should make more sequels of our movies"", ha! There is some fun music in the movie (have your dancing shoes ready for the final sequence!), most of wich is also featured on the CD soundtrack. Strangely, that CD does not include ""The Beginning of The End"", that new song from a reunited Black Sabbath (with Ozzy Osbourne), even though that songs plays prominently over the closing credits of the movie.

So how does this movie compare to those other ""end of the world"" movies? I'd still have to give the edge to ""Seeking a Friend"", perhaps Steve Carell's finest role ever, but ""This Is the End"" easily better that that artsy/pretentious ""Melancholia"". One caveat: ""This Is the End"" contains a boatload of cursing and other crude language, so viewer beware. If you can get past that, get ready to enjoy a movie in which the absurdity of it all is turned into the center of laughter.",1371081600,3,2385,4.66270783847981
