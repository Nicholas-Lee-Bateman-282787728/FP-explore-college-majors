2155955,5,B0003JAH0G,"I've seen several science fiction series in my time.  All of which boast to be the greatest.  ""Star Trek,"" ""Buck Rogers,"" ""Battlesar Galactica,"" ""Far Scape,"" ""Stargate S-G1.""  Fine shows in their own right and I have no problem against them.  But there has always been a place for ""Mobile Suit Gundam.""  A 25 year-old franchise that has becomes Japan's most popular science fiction series.  Many American fans are familiar with such (lackluster) titles as ""Gundam Wing"" and ""Gundam Seed,"" but none of those series hold a candle to this addition to the ""Gundam Universe,"" which is quite possibly the best entry into the stories...""Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.""

  Produced back in 1985, written and directed by the ""Father of Gundam"" Yoshiyuki Tomino, ""Zeta Gundam"" has been hailed by anime nuts as the pinnacle ""Gundam"" series.

  The story takes place in Universal Century 0087 (between ""Mobile Suit Gundam 0083"" and ""Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ"").  It has been seven years since the end of the One Year War, and the Principality of Zeon is long dead.  In order to prevent another war from occuring, the Federation creates the Titans; a sort of interstellar S.S. that watches over the colonies.  Of course, the Titans turn out to be crueler than expected, and resort to tyranny in order to control the colonies.  In response, the A.E.U.G. (Anti Earth Union Group) is formed, made up mostly of former Federation and Zeon soldiers, they strive to oust the Titans.  Enter Kamille Bidan, a young Newtype who witnesses the cruelty of the Titans.  During a skirmish on his home colony, Kamille ends up in the cockpit of his father's Mark 2 Gundam.  In the heat of battle he winds up on the side of the A.E.U.G.  and from that moment on...his life is changed forever.

  The show is darker and grittier than anything that has been shown on ""Gundam Wing"" or ""Seed.""  Here, the mobile suits are not invincible and the cost of war is high.  Lives are lost, love is crushed, and relationships are pushed closer to the fire.  This is classic Tomino and it is rare to find another anime that's as raw and as powerful as this.

  The series does show its age (it's almost 20 years old by this point), but I do not see how that can hinder any TRUE anime fan.

  The battle sequences are well-thought out and there is always an element of danger in each episode.  The outcome of the battles are never easily predicted, and the body count climbs to staggering heights as the series progresses.

  Those familiar with Tomino's works (aside from ""Gundam"" he has also directed series such as ""Dunbine,"" ""Brain Powered"" and ""Overman King Gainer"") will know that the man loves stories about human beings.  And essentially, that's what the characters of ""Zeta Gundam"" are; humans.  Complete with problems and faults very much like our own.  It's very easy to connect with these characters and you learn to feel for them as time goes on.

  Adding to this is the epic-scale music.  A nice misture between ""Star Blazers""-style orchestra and ""Nausicaa""-type synthesizers.  The effect isn't as cheesy as it sounds (pun not intended) and works well with the images on-screen.

  Moving onto the DVD specs...well, I'm not kidding when I say this is quite possibly the best anime box set to date.

  Not only does one get all 50 episodes, included is a poster, a 48 page encyclopedia, and 9 pencil sharpeners/mobile suit figurines. All this in a box drawn by Tsukasa Kotobuki of ""Saber Marionette J"" and ""Godannar"" fame.

  Again, this is a LIMITED release.  So grab yours while you can.

  ""Zeta Gundam"" is a marvel of tale that belongs up there with the greats of sci-fi stories.  Even if you're not a fan of science fiction or giant robots in particular, this anime will have something for everyone.  After all, who doesn't love a great story?

2155957,4,B0003JAH0G,"I have been a fan of Zeta Gundam for years and own most of the original japanese laserdiscs.

I love the original intro music and was really disapointed that its been changed. The new intro theme music is OK during the show but it doesn't fit as intro music. Its a terrible shame and really looses some of the excitement as each episode starts.

Still its very nice to finally be able to see the WHOLE series with subtitles and nice packaging and for that I am greatful.",1130544000,2,470,4.329545454545454
2155958,5,B0003JAH0G,"Yep, that's right. ONE OF THE VERY BEST ANIME DVD BOX SETS EVER!

This dvd box set is worth every penny. The dvd box illustration is great, the ultra slim dvd cases are absolutely cool, the mobile suit pencil sharpeners are adorable, and the whole package is just wonderful. However, the (outer) box that holds everything, is quite flimsy so for those who are not careful when it comes to handling their stuff, beware.

Not only that, Zeta Gundam is probably the best and highest rated Gundam TV series. Zeta Gundam is all about grit, realism, dark drama, meandering and twisting plots, emotion, as well as entertainment. Unlike newer Gundam series e.g. SEED, Zeta Gundam has no impractical mechas or bishounen (pretty boy) casts. Zeta Gundam does not dumb itself down with mainstreamism, neither does it shallow itself to appeal to the masses.

Essentially, Zeta Gundam is a NO NON-SENSE mecha show at its finest!

Can't wait for the dvd release of the movies, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation I - Heir To The Stars and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation II - Lovers.",1128038400,2,1086,4.76063829787234
2155959,5,B0003JAH0G,"For starters, Zeta Gundam is the sequel to the original Mobile Suit Gundam. That being said, it had high expectations...and it met them ALL. Higher animation (though it is still very old...but MUCH improved), new music, very interesting, multi layered characters...it had it all. While the music in Gundam had never been ""amazing"", or very memorable, it's not horrible music. While on the music subject...I didn't really care about the OP / Ending theme song problems Bandai had. I didn't care. I watched the OP theme song 2x, the first episode and when it changed after they got the Zeta Gundam. I never bothered with the ending. This little thing might irk alot of people...but I mean...come on people, theme songs? They aren't the only reason you buy a series...buy the Japanese Gundam Singles History CD's, they have the songs...but anyways...

The characters are the most fascinating part of Zeta. the hero, Kamille...your typical brat at first. He's arrogant, annoying, and moody. He eventually, though, becomes a much more emphatic and spiritual person. Char Aznable, the arch enemy from the original series...is Zeta's second main hero!! People change sides...and sometimes it's hard to tell who is really good or bad. People switch allegiances throughout the series. People also die as you get to know them...it's a gloomy series with a gloomy ending. This isn't light hearted...it's pretty series.

  At 50 episodes long...it can get overwhelming just trying to remember who everyone is. people disappear for so many episodes only to reappear a dozen later. The extras are a nice addition...not really needed, but if you end up loving the series, you'll appreciate them alot.

  All in all...this is an amazing series. It is old, it's dated...it's not really flashy and stuff...but it has the core of what anime should be...gripping plot lines, moving characters we can connect to, and a story we'll love. This is an amazing series, highly recommended!!",1126483200,2,1963,5.115625
2155960,5,B0003JAH0G,"I wasn't a big Gundam head up until last year 'round this time when a girlfriend broke up with me and, for whatever reason, I was playing GUNDAM Battle Assault2 RELENTLESSLY!

I've had a curiousity about Zeta since it came out in japan back in 85. I'd attend comic book and scifi conventions and I especially loved the anime for the time. I still attempt to read the japanese books on Zeta I picked up. Somebody told me I need to start reading right to left. Now if I could translate these squigly japanese text characters, things'd be cool.

Anyway, Zeta Gundam is SUCH a fantastic series and I'm very grateful to have finally had the oppurtunity to watch this great show. It was every thing I hoped over and I'm one of these guys that LOWER my expectations for like say movies and books and what not. I can actually die happy having seen this series 20 years after its debut, nuts as it sounds!

Gundam Nutz (hey theres a new mobile suit name) will already have this series on tape (probably fourth generation dubs)-I was happy with the quality of the DVD compilation (even though I DIDN'T recieve the little Gundam figures as advertised, oh well)",1125792000,,1149,4.514423076923077
2155961,5,B0003JAH0G,it is true this is one of the best gundam tv series the mobile suits are impresive and well designed the characters are amazing and the story is simply spectacular plus the bonuses like the 9 figures included in the box set the poster the z gundam guide and the original artwork make of this set a must have for all gundam fans,1125187200,,327,4.2063492063492065
2155962,4,B0003JAH0G,"Getting an accurate read on a show like Zeta can be hard due to all the hype that surrounds it. It has been alternately called the best Gundam series ever and the best anime series ever. I went into this with extremely high expectations due to all the things I had heard and ended up being a little underwhelmed. Having now watched it a second time (something I rarely do so quickly after the first viewing, but found I wanted to with this one because I enjoyed it more than I even realized), I came to a few conclusions. This is not a series that packs in a lot of eye-candy or visual ""wow-factor"", and, unlike some of the more recent Gundam entries, it doesn't fall back on the ""cool-factor"" of numerous uber-Gundams to make up for poorly choreographed battle sequences. It is not a show that blows you away from minute one or which will feed an addiction to action. It is, however, a deep, quality piece of work, a stand-out in an already stand-out crowd.

The plot is at once straight-forward and deceptively complex. The Earth Federation, Earth's monolithic world-government, forms an elite military police force known as the Titans to suppress anti-Earth sentiment in the orbiting space colonies. The Titans, however, drunk with power and controlled by ambitious and amoral warlords, run amok in the colonies while the Federation's civilian authorities sit on their hands, ignorant of the situation. Eventually, a group of Federation Forces officers, along with civilian volunteers, forms the Anti-Earth Union Group, an organization intent on making the Federation government aware of the Titans' activities, and civil war soon ensues. It's a welcome break from the standard Earth-vs-space colonies formula that forms the basis for almost every other Gundam series, and is, in my opinion, probably the best story line of any Gundam to date. It's a dramatic departure from the more straight-forward approach of its immediate predecessor, Mobile Suit Gundam, packing a lot more action and story into its run, and it pulls off its entire 50-episode run without a single ""recap"" or ""clip"" episode, making me feel like I was getting a little more bang for my buck, so to speak.

Zeta's much-ballyhooed characters are something of a mixed-bag, in my opinion, though. Depending on what you're looking for, they could be the franchise's best or its worst. Zeta's characters are, for the most part, complex, subtle people, often with conflicting desires and motivations. These are not the straight-forward, cookie cutter characters who so often inhabit stories like this. They are unique individuals with their own quirks and strange idiosyncrasies, like any real people would have. They are probably some of the franchise's deepest characters, and a group of fans could easily spend hours exploring and debating their actions and motives.  I think that this is where Zeta is at its most artistic, displaying a level of thought and planning one doesn't normally find in this type of story. That said, however, I also found them to be possibly the franchise's least likable cast. Most of them come across as cold and unapproachable for much of the series, which I found to be rather odd. Why Mr. Tomino chose to handle his characters this way, I'm not positive. I found that Bright and Lt. Quattro (Mobile Suit Gundam's masked antagonist Char Aznable in a new alias) really carried the show for me in terms of engaging characterization. Although I found that the characters appealed to me far more on a second viewing, my first impressions of them were not generally positive. This is a rather superficial complaint, however, as the characters really are some of the franchise's best once one breaches the surface. It also has two very memorable villains (two of Gundam's best, in my opinion), in Paptimus Scirocco and Haman Khan. It's almost worth buying the whole show just to see the normally composed Char yelling, ""Haman Khan!"" and flying into a wild rage.

There are many other things to be said for the show. The animation, though dated, holds up surprisingly well, and despite what another reviewer stated, is far superior to other animation of the time, particularly Robotech's, based on what I have seen of it. The character designs present a more down-to-Earth look for the cast than one finds in the newer Gundam series, eschewing the glossy, ""pretty-boy"" look of the main characters for something more average and approachable. Of course, one can't escape the toy-commercial elements of the mecha-genre, yet Mr. Tomino handles this with his usual deftness. His story produces hordes of elaborate designs to appease the toy company sponsors (and unfortunately inherits the transformable mech craze started by Macross - if I wanted to watch Transformers, I would), intoducing new designs quite frequently but then quickly and quietly shuffling them into the background to make room for the characters, with little of the pomp and fuss one finds in most other mecha series. Zeta Gundam never feels like it's screaming ""BUY THIS NOW!"" at its audience, much to the credit of its director.

The reason I give this series four stars, and why it is not my favorite entry in the franchise, despite my high opinion of its quality, is for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Mr. Tomino is almost too Tomino here, I felt. He is not a director who likes to spend a lot of time on exposition. He demands a high level of attention and critical analysis on the part of his audience, more than one might normally devote to this type of show, and normally, I enjoy this very much. I find it to be a welcome relief from the ""connect-the-dots"" style of some other directors, who seem to think their audience is either so mindless or paying so little attention that every little plot point and implication needs to be explained incessantly in order to be understood. Gundam SEED, in particular, suffers heavily from this. In this case, however, I think Mr. Tomino may have gone to a bit of an extreme with this approach. There are certain elements of the plot, such as the Titans' relationship to the Federation's civilian government, their invasion of Von Braun, the civil war nature of the Gryps Conflict, and the role of the Republic of Zeon, that I would have liked to see given more attention. I will also admit that some of the characters' motivations are a bit obscure. It's not that these things are impossible to understand given the show's presentation. Not at all. In fact, they're rather obvious if one pays even a modicum of attention to the story. It's just that I felt that some of these elements were either too important or just too interesting to be left to reading between the lines.

Those complaints, however, do little to detract from the overall quality of the show. Zeta Gundam is an intelligent, thought-provoking series, and one of the better sci-fi sagas to come around in recent memory. Like any good classic, it isn't a story to be watched and forgotten, but one to be experienced again and again and thought about for a good long time.

Finally, a note on the extras: There are sparingly few extras on the discs themselves, not even Bandai previews. However, this set does come with a handy booklet by Mark Simmons, possibly the most famous Gundam fan/expert in North America, which details the various factions, characters, and mobile suits of the show. There's also a nice poster and some pencil sharpeners, of all things. It should be noted that even if you're not interested in these things, the upcoming individual volume releases of the show are identical to this set in terms of the content of the discs themselves. In other words, you don't get any new stuff on those discs and you miss the pack-ins of the box set if you opt for that release over this one.",1125100800,6,7777,4.851656626506024
2155963,5,B0003JAH0G,"As someone who tends to leave negative reviews on Amazon.com, I'm usually not one to respond to specific reviews.  But Michael Regan's review of Zeta Gundam just irked me so much that I felt compelled to defend one of the best Gundam series ever.

Mr. Regan first stated that the show's plot was an absolute mess.  Are you kidding?  Zeta was my first UC Gundam series; it is complicated and deep, but not incomprehensive.  The plot is interesting because of all of the political intrigue, not to mention the fact that the enemy in this series was the ""good"" guy only seven years prior.  I cannot think of one plot point that was touched upon and then abandoned.

The new factions are clearly elaborated upon; the old ones should be old hat to a Gundam fan.  Also, the Titans thing was continued from 0083.  Remember, Gundam carries on over from other series.

As for characters... Unlike Aristotle, I believe that characters are more important than plot, and in this category Zeta has some of the best around.  Mr. Regan accused the characters of not developing or changing.  Was he sleeping for the entire thing?  Because every central character goes through development and changes in some way.  The best example would be Camille, who gradually matures throughout the series.  No one is simply 2-d; even the Titans, who are the big bad guys, are shown as human and even sometimes likable (like Maua Pharoah; I cannot think of one person who does not like her, despite her being a ""villain"")  Even Jerid grows; as his hatred for Camille deepens and as he sets out to avenge what Camille did to him, just makes things worse.  Minor characters too are given amazingly detailed background, like Rosamia Badam for instance.

Mr. Regan also reprehends the massive death count in Zeta as a means of character development.  It is most certainly not intended to be such.  Zeta is just being realistic; in war, people die.  Sometimes before you get enough of a chance to know them.

As for the defection at the end; it's a stupid reason, but believable enough.  No less believable than Shiro Armada deserting the EF to be with Aina (and I believe that Mr. Regan praised 08th MS Team at the end)

Animation-wise... you should know by now that if you care about animation, Gundam is not for you.  I personally like Zeta's animation; I think Kitazume and Yas were a wonderful team.

As for the romances... are you kidding me?  Camille/Four was at least better developed than Amuro/Lalah; and they were Newtypes so of course they fell in love easily. Camille/Fa was awesome because it could have been done like Amuro/Frau, but was taken in a different direction.  Jerid and his respective romances softened up a character whom by all rights should have been entirely hated (most people tell me that they hated Jerid until Maua came along)  Amuro/Beltochika was cute because Beltochika wasn't afraid to speak her mind to him.  And who didn't love how Paptimus manipulated women, putting them under his spell with just one fluid hand movement?  This may go without saying, but it's fun to see where the MSG relationships ended up as well.

If you are not already convinced that Mr. Regan doesn't know what he is talking about as far as Gundam is concerned, you only has to look at the last part of his review for the message to hit home:

""For an actual quality Gundam go watch F91, X, Seed, ZZ, the original trilogy, 08th MS. Heck, practically anything that isn't Zeta.""

Let's see here.  F-91 was a series crammed into a movie that copied many old Gundam cliches.  SEED actually forgets the reason Gundam was made in the first place.  08th MS Team... and Mr. Regan complains about awful romances?  In 08th the commander ditches his band of brothers for a piece of hot Zeon tail he's only known for two days.  And he isn't even a Newtype!

The most offensive comment to me was ZZ.  Has Mr. Regan *seen* ZZ?  I doubt it, because if he has he would be praising Zeta to the high heavens.  I've had the unfortunate experience of sitting through ZZ, and it is without a doubt the worst UC series in existence.

So, you'll have to excuse me for questioning Mr. Regan's judgment as far as Gundam is concerned.  I wrote this for those people who are reading reviews to determine if something should be watched.  I do not want prospective Zeta fans to be deterred by Mr. Regan's rather ignorant comments.  Also, I would like Zeta to have five stars.",1121817600,,4427,4.638352638352639
2155964,4,B0003JAH0G,"yeah, it's been a while coming, but five years after the release of the (personally opinated) beautiful show that started it all in America, Gundam WING, we finally get the sequel to the oringal Gundam show: Z Gundam. ""Zeta Gundam"" in US (Gundam Wing was also called Gundam W in Japan and Bandai changed the title), this show chronicles the Gryps conflict of UC 0087, seven years after the one year war and four years after the mini war of the Delaz fleet, which to its end led up to the creation of the Earth Federation's TITANS...who are the main bad guys in Z Gundam. Although the good guy-bad guy land isn't as blurry as it is in Gundam Wing, it's still pretty freakin' blurry! Seeing how diabolical the Federation can be in some of the episodes of Mobile Suit Gundam and final episodes of 0083, you get to finally see what the Feds are like when they have ""all the power they need."" With new Gundam models like the Gundam Mk. II and the HUGE Psycho Gundam (which they don't reveal until later), only the AEUG, whose members include former Feds (like Amuro Ray), former Zeons (like Char Aznable), and civilians (like new main character Camille Bidan) has the determination to fight them and regain liberation from the earth. Soon a group known as Axis Zeon joins the Titans and it becomes a three-way battle for hatred, love, and power between the three factions. Despite the hard battles they goes through, Camille and Char have the fate of the war rested upon their shoulders with their newtype powers, their determination, and last but not least, their mobile suits: Char's Hyaku Shiki, and Camille's transformable ZETA GUNDAM.

If you read any of the other reviews you know that ZG is probably the BEST Gundam series in its 25+ year legacy. However, the package is pretty whack--although i didn't care so much for endings, the openings (and endings) were changed without any advance warning. so G fans were dissappointed...and that's stupid...once again, Bandai screws us over. But at least we have the series. It's a strong departure from it's sequels and prequels, as well as its alternate universe cousins (the ones Americans were mostyle introduced to: SEED, WING, G). A good example is that in Wing, the Gundams are near invincible; even it's own self-destruct system leaves at leat 70% of the Gundam still intact! However (and this is also a good example in SEED--just watch the Z-inspired episode 49) Gundams are still strong, but aren't indestructable. Love is a constant factor that both strengthens and cripples the characters, espeically Camille who falls for a gorgeous newtype named Four. Just like Amuro and Lalah from the orignal, these two are on opposite sides...the only thing different is that Four is also a Gundam pilot. and i won't spoil it, but don't think Gundam Wing here--people DIE. nobody is invincible just because their the main characters. People are shot, stabbed, blown up, sucked into space, impaled on mobile suits...it's horrid and it's great! Not only is Zeta Gundam the best Gundam series, but it also inspired other series as well. Check out 1993's Victory Gundam sometime, or better yet, wait later this year and watch 2004's Gundam Seed Destiny when it airs on Cartoon Network; you'll see just how much like Zeta it is. Watch this series and feel the full Gundam experience! My opinion is that EVERY Gundam series is perfect in their own ways, and i love each one to the fullest extent. but this...oh man, it's on another level. no joke; pick this one up. (and don't wait for it to come on television--as dark, gloomy, and tenebrous as this series is, you think they'd actually show it? Ha...maybe later. Much later) ""BELIEVE IN THE SIGN OF ZETA"" as the oringal opening song suggests and feel the newtype power. feel the stuggle.",1118275200,2,3778,4.785604900459418
2155965,1,B0003JAH0G,"I've been a Gundam fan for years. I've seen about every Gundam out there at this point. Understandably I was eager to see what many had bandied about as the greatest Gundam ever. Finally the box set arrived on my doorstep. After getting around the damaged DVDs I finally watched the show, and found it to be empty. Totally empty. There are no characters. No development. Nothing changes. Key plot points are skipped over or ignored. The animation is a bit meh for a show of its period. (When comparing it to Macross at least.[And that's going by the aged Robotech DVDs.])

Honestly, the writing was simply terrible, the plotting boring, wandering, and without focus.  Tomino's normal pizzazz for mecha fights was... missing.

This is everything a good show should NOT be. Character drama? Where? The characters were boring, didn't react naturally, or reacted just the right way to get them killed. Epic story? The show doesn't even give you a good sense of the various factions beliefs, goals, or force distribution. All key.

Other reviewers mention characters changing allegiances.  This actually happens all of twice in the whole show.  Once right away, and again about two thirds of the way through for no real reason.  This characters actual motivations aren't made clear at all.  There is no drama here.  For there to be drama things have to change.  Everybody ends the show exactly how they began it, or dead since Tomino thinks killing people is a good way to develop them.  The so called romances were mind staggeringly boring.  The characters didn't seem like they even knew who each other were other than a face.  And yet they're in deep ever lasting love.  What?

For an actual quality Gundam go watch F91, X, Seed, ZZ, the original trilogy, 08th MS. Heck, practically anything that isn't Zeta.

I don't normally review things, as I find the given reviews are usually fairly accurate, yet I find any love for Zeta to be offensive as a thinking human being, hence I had to actually write one for once.  And then I get an actual response.  Is that even normal?  Allowed?  In anycase, I find myself having to defend my position.  Her comments will be marked off with a simple ""**"", mine not.  (As I don't even know if Amazon lets me italicize.)

88As someone who tends to leave negative reviews on Amazon.com, I'm usually not one to respond to specific reviews. But Michael Regan's review of Zeta Gundam just irked me so much that I felt compelled to defend one of the best Gundam series ever.

The plot is interesting because of all of the political intrigue, not to mention the fact that the enemy in this series was the ""good"" guy only seven years prior. I cannot think of one plot point that was touched upon and then abandoned.**

By mess I mean the blasted thing jerked around from so many different plot threads and ideas that no cohesive story was told.  It had to many things trying to happen, and to many pointless battle, or MS of the week episodes.  Also, half the time the Titans were shown the be independant in some way of the Federation, and the other half not.

**The new factions are clearly elaborated upon; the old ones should be old hat to a Gundam fan. Also, the Titans thing was continued from 0083. Remember, Gundam carries on over from other series.**

Clearly elaborated on?  Really?  So the Titans are an Earth supremicest group who only alow Earthnoids in yet happilly work with Axis, and before that, before they were scared, sign up a guy from Jupiter?

Also, of course the Titans were shown being created in 0083.  But that was made years later, so it's not worth noting when speaking of Z.

**As for characters... Unlike Aristotle, I believe that characters are more important than plot, and in this category Zeta has some of the best around.

Minor characters too are given amazingly detailed background, like Rosamia Badam for instance.**

I agree that characters are the most important thing in a story.  It is characters that move the plot.  Unfortunatelly Zeta had no developed characters to speak of.  All stayed about the same.  Jerid stayed an idiotic jerk who only wanted revenge throughout the whole show.  Kamille matured some sure, but that's about it for character growth.  No other character actually changed.  You just got to see a bit more of their true self now and then maybe.  Never change.

And you've just met a person who doesn't like Maou.  I found her to be offensibly stupid.  I mean she liked Jerid after all.  The largest windbag and waste of screen time I've ever seen in a Gundam show.  Please tell me what Rosamia's back story was.  I must have napped through it.  All she had were maybe memories of a brother.

**Mr. Regan also reprehends the massive death count in Zeta as a means of character development. It is most certainly not intended to be such. Zeta is just being realistic; in war, people die. Sometimes before you get enough of a chance to know them.**

Which is fairly shoddy story telling for a TV show.  I mean, am I supossed to care that spineless Four died?  Elpe's death was far sadder, as she made a choice to try to have a family and died protecting it.  (Refering to your last sentence only there.)  And I believe I was referring to how characters were only shown changing, or even having emotions when somebody died.  Not the count.  As 0080 showed us, sometimes it's not the number that died, it's the who and how.

**As for the defection at the end; it's a stupid reason, but believable enough. No less believable than Shiro Armada deserting the EF to be with Aina (and I believe that Mr. Regan praised 08th MS Team at the end) **

He deserted the EF basically because he wanted to stop the fighting, not so much to be with Aina.  That was really more of a bonus.  Anywho, the defection in Zeta was fairly pointless.  Again, I couldn't even tell what I was supossed to feel about that character.  Sorry for her?  Angry?  I just wanted her to die and get off my screen really.

**Animation-wise... you should know by now that if you care about animation, Gundam is not for you. I personally like Zeta's animation; I think Kitazume and Yas were a wonderful team.**

I'm sorry, but if a show made of that time couldn't look as good as other shows of that time, then it's lacking a bit.  Now, I'm not saying it's dreadful looking, just that it wasn't as well animated as I expected.

**As for the romances... are you kidding me? Camille/Four was at least better developed than Amuro/Lalah; and they were Newtypes so of course they fell in love easily. Camille/Fa was awesome because it could have been done like Amuro/Frau, but was taken in a different direction. Jerid and his respective romances softened up a character whom by all rights should have been entirely hated (most people tell me that they hated Jerid until Maua came along) Amuro/Beltochika was cute because Beltochika wasn't afraid to speak her mind to him. And who didn't love how Paptimus manipulated women, putting them under his spell with just one fluid hand movement? This may go without saying, but it's fun to see where the MSG relationships ended up as well. **

Kamille and Fa was probably the best in the show, sadly towards the end it seemed to finally be building yet never go anywhere.  Kamille and Four I hated, as the two had no chemistry, Four bothered me a lot, and Kamille barelly even reacted to her death.  He was okay and back to showing no emotion two episodes later.  Jerid and Mauo, again I hated as Jerid was such a horrible human being with no redeeming qualities the idea of anybody loving him, much less a seemingly normal girl like Maou I found absurd.  Beltorchika I actually liked as a character and found to be a breath of fresh air in the otherwise staggeringly dull cast of Zeta.  Paptimus too just annoyed me.  The idea that he could so easilly control these people was unbelievable at best.

**If you are not already convinced that Mr. Regan doesn't know what he is talking about as far as Gundam is concerned, you only has to look at the last part of his review for the message to hit home:

""For an actual quality Gundam go watch F91, X, Seed, ZZ, the original trilogy, 08th MS. Heck, practically anything that isn't Zeta.""

Let's see here. F-91 was a series crammed into a movie that copied many old Gundam cliches.**

Very true.  Yet I think it did it very well without getting either to cliched, or lacking in logic.

**SEED actually forgets the reason Gundam was made in the first place.**

How so?

**08th MS Team... and Mr. Regan complains about awful romances? In 08th the commander ditches his band of brothers for a piece of hot Zeon tail he's only known for two days. And he isn't even a Newtype!**

Indeed.  That was the most annoying part of 08th, and I was most pleased with how Miller's Report ditched the ""I love you line"".  It made the two seem more like people with chemistry who both wanted to stop the fighting.  And again, Shiro didn't ditch the EF in order to be with Aina, but rather he wanted to stop the fighting and killing.  It's worth noting that that EF commanding officer was rather evil and Titan material.

Here I must comment on Newtypes:  I must say I hate how Gundam went from having them have a higher empathic ability and understanding in order to show what was needed between people to stop and end war to being a mystical semi Jedi breed of human.  I want space fantasy I'll watch or read Star Wars.  I want something a bit harder and more real I should be able to go to Gundam.  Sadly, after viewing Zeta I feel I can't anymore.

**The most offensive comment to me was ZZ. Has Mr. Regan *seen* ZZ? I doubt it, because if he has he would be praising Zeta to the high heavens. I've had the unfortunate experience of sitting through ZZ, and it is without a doubt the worst UC series in existence.**

I can't disagree more.  I found it to be the best.  Delivering MSG's overall messages with a bit more of a developing and dramatic story to it.  I also found Elpe's death to easilly be the saddest death in any Gundam.

**So, you'll have to excuse me for questioning Mr. Regan's judgment as far as Gundam is concerned. I wrote this for those people who are reading reviews to determine if something should be watched. I do not want prospective Zeta fans to be deterred by Mr. Regan's rather ignorant comments. Also, I would like Zeta to have five stars.**

I'm not ignorant, I rather have a dissenting point of view based on the rubish that was Zeta Gundam.  It had potential, but then didn't give me any characters to care about, or to get attatched to.  Nor a developing plot with energy or direction.  Honestly, a battle as big as Jabura was devilivered with the same amount of energy as a standard skirmish with two other suits.  Just bad directing there.  I have hopes that the new Zeta trilogy will clear a good deal of this up.  We'll see.",1117756800,8,11657,4.552884615384615
2155966,4,B0003JAH0G,"This is the most anticipated Gundam series released in North America and yet Bandai has put together one of the worst DVD releases. The biggest problem is that Bandai has replaced the original OP/ED songs without informing the fans ahead of time. To anime otaku's, changing the OP/ED is like raping their show. Fans pre-ordered the DVD box set, waited for its release and finally popped disc 1 into their DVD player, and then only to find out that the OP song was replaced by another piece of music. Had Bandai been more forthcoming, this DVD release would not be as worst as fans put it.

Apart from the changed OP/ED, the DVD box set is a rather solid release, consisting of 10 volumes in thinpaks housed within a shiny collector's box. The box set also includes a 48-page booklet and 9 collectible action figure pencil sharpeners.",1116028800,,833,4.666666666666667
2155967,3,B0003JAH0G,"Yes yes we all know about the original op&ed songs being missing but I knew that before I purchased a set so it wasn't that a big deal to me. Sure it really would be great they keep them but it's some licensing problem so they probably didn't want to shell out extra cash for a release that's probably not gonna sell many copies compare to newer gundam series. My complaint isn't about the songs but the subtitle they put in. For those who ""didn't"" notice, the subtitle(only 1 version) used in these dvd are actually for the English voice track and in many occasion are way different than they are suppose to be. It was rather painful for me to watch it while having to translate the right line in my head. Another thing that kinda tick me off is the ending credit listing. All they used are the same list with most of the cast every time instead of actually listing the cast and staff for each episode. Also they used....Alphabetical order even for Japanese cast?! What are they thinking?! I really would like they keep the original list in Japanese like some of their gundam dvds have.
Seriously I'd rather they use the fund for those MS pencil sharpner into the actual dvd content itself instead to make it better. The slim cases and new cover arts are very nice so I'll give them that. The video and sounds are good also. Hopefully Bandai will fix those problem with ZZ&V Gundam next time...that's ""if"" they do though.:) Sure took them long enough for Z and the result isn't as good as us fans wanted.",1114128000,3,1505,4.436823104693141
2155968,5,B0003JAH0G,"Yes, and I don't distinguish anime from live-action. Compared to Star Trek or Star Wars, Gundam series has always the edge of reality.  You shouldn't call yourself a spacewar sci-fi fan if you haven't seen Gundam, especially Universal Century Gundam !  Universal Century Gundam ranks equally with Star Trek and Star Wars saga as space sci-fi best.  But Gundam is Gundam, and Gundam distinguishes itself from Star Trek and Star Wars in its own ways.

Gundam doesn't need stuffs like alien races, warp/hyper drive, time travel, extra dimension, transporter, or parallel universes. Simply humankind in the future, when the time has come for humankind to colonize space beyond Earth atmosphere within our solar system.  Enter into this realistic depiction of future, an even more realistic depiction of politics, drama, relationship, romance, and war.  Gundam doesn't shy away from showing the darkest sides of life, yet at the same encourages that hope, understanding, and total struggle are invaluable to achieve a far better future.  Characters in Gundam, either individual or organizational, are complex ones with unexpectable traits and behaviors, which are exemplified best by the character of Char Aznable, one of my favorite characters.  Gundam is the animated version of its creators' vision about the future.

Most of American audience often look down at Gundam saying that it is merely a giant robot show for children.  They are absolutely wrong.  Mobile Suits in Gundam are nothing but war machines, just like aircrafts, tanks, or warship.  They are not invicible.  It is the characters, the drama, the plot twists, which make Gundam a very worthy addition to any sci-fi fan collection.  Heroes and villains are killed, life and love are lost, trust, loyalty and friendship are betrayed.  Characters grow and change, both in the good and bad directions.  Mind you, the plot twists and story are truly different from what you would expect from a typical American space sci-fi.

Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (MSG:Z) is the second series after the original Mobile Suit Gundam (MSG).  The original MSG takes place in Universal Century (UC) 0079.  Zeta advances to the year UC 0087.  Here, seven years have passed since the end of The One Year War, which was depicted in MSG.  You should watch either  the full MSG series or the MSG movie trilogy before you watch MSG:Z, as the story in MSG:Z builds up from MSG.

In MSG, the main backdrop on the story is a great war, The One Year War, fought between The Earth Federation and The Principality of Zeon.  The Earth Federation is a collective government of countries on Earth and space colonies outside Earth. The Principality of Zeon rules a group of powerful space colonies located beyond the Moon, at Lagrangian point 2 of Earth-Moon system.  Zeon was previously under collective rule by Earth Federation, and its declaration of independence triggered the great war.  Zeon declared war with Earth Federation, and in three months of war, the number of casualties reach a horrible value of billions of lives.  At the end of MSG, The Earth Federation was the victor, and Zeon was again under Federation' authority.

However, remnants of Zeon are still scattered around the solar system.  They carry with them the idea of freedom from Earth for all space colonies and space citizens.  In UC 0083, a group of Zeon soldiers and sympathizers, The Delaz Fleet, launched a surprise counter-attack on Federation, dubbed Operation Stardust.  Federation Space Forces led by Jamitov Hymem and Bask Om repelled back The Delaz Fleet, but the whole incident forced Federation to rethink its global defense strategy.  Operation Stardust is told in more detail in the OVA series Gundam 0083.

The Earth Federation Space Forces decided to established a special unit, The Titan Task Force, in order to patrol the space around Earth and pursue remnants of Zeon soldiers and sympathizers, and furthermore to search for any anti-Federation resistance groups.  Jamitov Hymem was appointed as Titans' supreme commander, and Bask Om was appointed as Titans' field operation commander.  Titans was granted with full authority to conduct their operations of pursuing remnants of Zeon and other possible resistance groups which are considered to endanger the Federation.

Sadly, Titans are nothing but people whose souls are pulled down by Earth's gravity.  Behind the back of Earth Federation, Titans' leaders resent and hate space citizens, and they abuse their power to oppress space citizens in the name of Federation.  In reality, Titans have become a private armed forces of its leaders with a goal to gain power over the Federation.  To hide their true power-hunger intentions, Titan's leaders argue that the internal security and stability of Federation is far more important than the civil rights of Federation citizens (Does this sound familiar ?).  Everything can be justified in the name of Federation, with total disregard to human rights, and even worse, human lives.  Under disguise as official Federation Forces, Titans become nothing more than a group of cruel fascists yearning for power.

Space citizens react and start to protest the existence of Titans.  Rallies and demonstrations to voice their protest become common view in space colonies.  But Titans simply shut themselves to such protests, and they continue with all their cruel and inhumane actions.  And they finally cross the intolerable line.  A mass rally prostesting Titans' action broke out in Space Colony 30.  Titans forces raided the colony and injected lethal, poisonous gas into the colony's airflow system.  Three millions of lives are killed in a blink of an eye.  The news about this incident is not leaked into public on Earth by Federation, but the news spread out in space colonies.

The Earth Federation has been degraded to become nothing but a bunch of weak, shameless, corrupt, and coward politicians who only care about their own well-beings. They are nothing but puppets, while Titans leaders are the actual rulers of Federation.

Disgusted by all evil act committed by Titans, space citizens then form rebel paramilitary organizations with a united goal to end the tyranny of Titans.  Two organizations, AEUG (Anti Earth Union Group) which operates in space, and Karaba which operates on Earth, stand together in the war against Titans, for the future of all space citizens.

Renegade soldiers from Earth Federation Space Forces and former soldiers of the Principality of Zeon join hand-in-hand and fight together against Titans.  Behind the frontline of AEUG and Karaba military forces, investors and politicians both from Earth and space colonies became the AEUG and Karaba's political government and financial backers.  Leading members of AEUG and Karaba are Bright Noa, Char Aznable, Melanie Hue Carbine, Wong Lee, Emma Sheen, Hayato Kobayashi, Amuro Ray, and many more people.  And Zeta introduce the lead hero Kamille Bidan, a teenage civilan,  who again was unwillingly dragged into war.

Zeta does rehash the old plot twist of good government turns bad and a rebel organization appears to save the day, but the plot twist is really different from any other similar stories.  What really interesting is to see former adversaries from The One Year War combine their forces for the good of all.  How Bright, Amuro, and Hayato who had fought Char with their lives during The One Year War, now worked together with Char with a united goal to end the tyranny of Titans for the future of all Earth and space citizens.

Bright Noa was the legendary captain of Federation's assault space carrier White Base during The One Year War.  As a cadet officer at the age of nineteen with only six month of field assignment, he was appointed as acting captain of White Base, after White Base lost almost all its military crew because of a surprise ambush led by Char Aznable (Not even James Kirk commands his own spaceship at the age of nineteen).  Bright had to replaced White Base's original military crew by recruiting civilians.  He confidently commanded White Base and its newly-recruited civilian crew through victories in many battles in Earth and space before finally participating in the decisive battle at asteroid A Baoa Qu, where the Federation finally defeated Zeon.  The story of Bright and White Base is the basis of the original series Mobile Suit Gundam.  After The One Year War, Bright was alienated by Earth Federation Space Forces High Command, as they are afraid of his popularity and reputation.  He was transferred to command a civil shuttle transport.

Bright abandoned his commission with the Earth Federation Space Forces and joined AEUG, after realizing that Federation is doing nothing to stop Titans' evil actions.  He is now captain of the space assault carrier Argama, the flagship of AEUG space fleet.  As a veteran captain of the great One Year War who has a wealth of experience in real space battles, Bright proves his capacity again and again in various battles between Titans and AEUG.  I consider Bright as the most famous and legendary spaceship captain in Gundam Universe.

Char Aznable was the top-ace mobile suit pilot of Zeon, famously known as `The Red Comet'.  In Zeta, he disguised himself with the name Quattro Bajeena, and now is a mobile suit pilot above Argama, where he is also the commander of Argama's mobile suits forces.  Together with Bright, Char form the core leadership of AEUG military forces. In Zeta Gundam, Char is the second lead character after Kamille Bidan.  Char also plays a dominant role as Kamille's mentor, and it is really exciting to see how Char guides Kamille to evolve from a young, angstly-ridden, and naive boy to become a true soldier who understand his role in the world and the world around him.

Melanie Hue Carbine and Wong Lee are investors from Anaheim Electronics, the primary financial backer of AEUG, also the principal constructor of AEUG space ships and mobile suits.  Needless to say that they sometimes disagree with Bright and Char in overall military and political strategy of AEUG.

Emma Sheen was formerly a Titan mobile suit pilot.  She looks like a strict person but is actually very kind-hearted inside.  She wasn't aware of all the brutalities committed by Titans, and was terribly shocked when Char showed him all the evidence of Titans' evil actions in Space Colony 30.  Emma deserted Titans and joined AEUG.  Her elite pilot training makes her one of AEUG lead pilots, together with Char Aznable and Kamille Bidan.  She and Kamille are very close, and Kamille which is an only child ofter look at her as a big sister (with a little bit of crush maybe ?).

Hayato Kobayashi was a shy crew member of White Base in One Year War, but now he has outgrown his past and become leader of the resistance organization Karaba.  Amuro Ray, he was the legendary Newtype pilot of the first Gundam back in One Year War, but this Amuro has been confined by Federation far from the frontline, as The Federation is afraid of his Newtype capabilities.  Yet Amuro finally escape from his confinement and join Karaba.  With his amazing Newtype capability, Amuro takes no time to regain back all his combat agility, and within a short time he is back in action in the frontline.

We will also see various characters from the original MSG, as they will make both cameo or supporting roles throughout the series.

But the truly real star of Zeta Gundam is Kamille Bidan, a seventeen-year old teenager with all the angst and temper.  Kamille hates his own feminine name, and he is doing all he can to prove that he is a man.  History repeats itself as Kamille was drawn into the war as a mobile suit pilot.  He rises into the rank of ace mobile suit pilot and transforms into a true soldier, thanks to the tutelage of Char Aznable, Amuro Ray, and Bright Noa.  No other characters in the Gundam Universe has this kind of privilege.  Although Kamille fights for AEUG from battle to battle throughout MSG:Z, unlike Amuro, he retains his civilian status, and never enlisted officially as AEUG soldier and assigned a military rank.  A great pilot he is, but a civilian he remains.

Throughout the series we will the complex interactions between parties: not only characters, but also between various political,  financial, and military organizations.  Bright is well-known as a strict and by-the-book Federation Forces officer.  But having witnesssed all the brutalities committed by Titans, and realizing that Federation Forces are doing nothing to stop those,  he follows his heart and deserts Federation to join AEUG and fight Titan.  Char Aznable who was known as the villain in MSG, now fights with his life to protect Earth and space citizens from the tyranny of Titans, and surrender is certainly not among his words.  But he always says he is his own master. Who knows what really his secret plan is.  Kamille starts as quite hot-headed, angry, and sometimes pathetic young man, but war has forced him to outgrown his age, and later he become calmer and wiser.  Amuro was a great war hero in The One Year War, but this  Amuro is certainly not the same Amuro we have seen in MSG.  Anaheim Electronics builds the AEUG flagship space carrier Argama and mobile suit forces, but they claim to be independent and neutral in front of Earth Federation Government.  The Federation which was the good party in the original Mobile Suit Gundam, now has become weak.  The emergence of Titans seems want to say that even with democracy and united government like The Earth Federation, the evil side of humans is still lingering in the background, waiting to re-emerge.  And all of those were scripted and animated 20 years ago !

There is a caveat though. Some fanatic anime purist claim that the US release of Zeta is not pure, as the opening and ending theme have been replaced by instrumental scores taken from the series.  This is due to licensing problem.  However, I myself find the replacement opening theme to be a treat, it certainly glorified the greatness of Gundam.

Do yourself a treat and get this Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.  You definitely will not regret it.  There are very few sci-fi series who can match the complex and realistic ways Zeta Gundam describes the future of humanity.

Believe in the sign of Zeta !

``On Earth, humans souls are pulled down by gravity, and they can't fly freely as they should'' - Char Aznable.

``Those who have to be removed, are only those whose souls are pulled down by gravity !  But even that reason is not enough to justify mass murders and wars !  Why build a new world if no one can live one's life in it !'' - Kamille Bidan.

``Kamille, the new world CAN NOT be built by the older generation.  Do you think the world can be a better place if kids like you have to fight and sacrifice themselves for older people like me ?'' - Char Aznable to Kamille Bidan during the deadly moments of final battle between AEUG against Titans.

``Why we have to fight amongst each other, and further pollute the Earth'' - Quattro Bajeena/Char Aznable, in his speech before Federation's General Assembly where he exposes all the crimes committed by Titans and AEUG is only doing all they can to stop Titans.

``Welcome back Lieutenant.  Why you look so shy ?  Your speech was broadcasted all over the space colonies.  Pirated copies, of course.  You have given all space citizens a new hope.  I'm truly honored to be working with you, Char Aznable.'' - Bright Noa, after welcoming back Char on board of Argama and shaking Char's hand, forgetting all his past adversaries between him and Char seven years ago during The One Year War.

``People sometimes hate each other because of misunderstandings, right ?  But even the most different can become friends.  But that kind of understanding will takes time to develop.  And we are not just dealing with a few number of people here.  But one day, maybe people will finally be able to understand one another.  And when that day come, I believe we will be reunited at last, with those who have passed away'' - Kamille Bidan.",1108944000,8,16087,4.921677802524128

Due to the dark and often sad nature of this series, like normal it is always serious and will not dissappoint, it is worth the money especialy for those who have waited many long years. Buy it here for 40 dollars less than at other places. This is a must for any gundam fan, don't be stupid and see it before you see the original.",1108425600,2,432,4.345679012345679
2155970,2,B0003JAH0G,"Although it's nice that Zeta finally got a release in the West, Bandai once again demonstrates that they just don't care about non-Japanese fans in this slipshod collection.  First they decided not to release 0079 with an original Japanese language track, which was utterly inexcusable since their MSRP on those discs was the same as a dual-language, at most outlets.  And now this.

Although some people may dismiss the loss of the original opening and ending sequences, they are nonetheless an important and impressive part of the whole work.  Certainly the loss of these themes in this release can only be indicative of further disregard for fans of the Gundam franchise, especially those who were so enthusiastic in trying to persuade Bandai to release Zeta here.  If they couldn't release the work decently, they shouldn't have done a half-arsed job with its release.  'If something is worth doing,' my elementary school teachers often said, 'it is worth doing right.'  Unfortunately apparently Bandai has never heard of this saying.

Since animation is a medium full of sound and visual stimuli, irresponsible editing and flagrant omission of aspects can drastically change the experience of it for others.  Now that anime has become more popular in the US and experienced a renewed 'boom' in the rest of the world, Bandai should be aware that butchered series don't sell quite so well; dub-only anime DVDs have all but gone the way of the dinosaurs.  Even Wal-Mart carries dual-language anime now.  But of course this is Bandai, who could have easily secured the Japanese language track for 0079 for its Western release but didn't want to tempt Japanese consumers into buying what they thought would be a cheaper alternative release to something they had neglected to release on Japanese DVD.  To anyone with half a brain, this is pretty laughable in and of itself.

It's nice that they decided to pack this release full of extras, but that plus the rather low retail price indicate that Bandai are fully aware that their choices in Zeta's release are going to severely damage its marketability, since they have to depend on longtime Gundam fans for at least some of the stable basis of their profits on this release.  It's certainly nice to have these little extra things, but really what Gundam fan wouldn't already have various collectible figurines, posters, references to the timeline and technology, etc?  And furthermore, what serious Gundam fan wouldn't already have Zeta in some form preserving the original presentation?  So basically they're counting on people who've already seen Zeta and probably already have it, to support a release that's inferior, solely to collect some meagre trinkets that are probably just like items they already have, more or less.

No, Bandai.  Bad Bandai.  Learn to make decent releases and respect where your money's coming from, or it'll stop coming.  Zeta's good, but it's not worth buying in its entirety twice (because I'd imagine that with its angst level most people won't want to watch it over again) just to sit on your shelf and collect dust.  And whenever you get the odd urge to watch an episode, you'll go for the decent release you have that includes the openings and endings, rather than Bandai's castrated version.

My advice:  give this one a miss.  It's not worth it.  Find a good release, not this rubbish.  You can get Zeta figurines and booklets and posters anywhere.",1107734400,6,3436,4.984210526315789
2155971,5,B0003JAH0G,"It's a rare thing to find a sequel that surpases the original property.  However, that is the case with the excellent Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.  A sequel to the 1979 anime series Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta takes all the aspects of the already excellent original series and refines them to create a genuinely enjoyable and exciting experience.

Zeta Gundam is a fan favorite because of its dark tone and elaborate storyline.  Zeta Gundam takes place in the year UC 0087, seven years after the end of the original series.  In a surprising plot twist, the ""good guys"" from Mobile Suit Gundam, the Earth Federation, have become the antagonists of the show with their sinister Titans taskforce, which wants to make the entire Earthsphere its plaything.  The story centers around the Anti-Earth Union Group, a military force comprised of a former Zeon ace pilot and Federation soldiers who oppose the Titans and their brutal tactics.

Like any good Gundam series, the major strength of the show is the great cast of characters.  Kamille Bidan, a brash young man who is quick to anger because of his unfortunate name, is the main character, and though he may start out as simply an annoying kid, it becomes easy to identify with him as he matures throughout the course of the war.  Quattro Bajeena is another main character.  He is the AEUG's red-clad pilot who is calm and rational, but harbors a dark secret from the past.  An all-star supporting cast rounds out the group, from the likeable former Titan officer Emma to the Kamille's hapless and tragic rival, Jerid.

Ironically though, the show's biggest strength can also prove to be a bit of a weakness.  Some characters like Katz and Rosamia can be extremely obnoxious at times.  These characters seem to only be in the show in order to screw up or act strange.  Fa can also be annoying, and it's incredibly bothersome to see characters like her and Katz performing the same dumb mistakes over and over again.

The animation in the show is fairly outdated, as the show was created back in the mid 80's.  It's far from unwatchable, and it even gives the show a distinct personality that is different from all the shiny and bright anime shows that are around now.

The music is fairly simple like in Mobile Suit Gundam, but there are some memorable tracks that set the mood of the show.  However, I noticed that around the middle of the series, the sound quality seems to drop dramatically and sound almost like it is mono instead of surround or stereo at times.  It's not a terribly big deal, but it is a bit of a bizarre annoyance.

At this point, it's important to mention that the original opening theme of the show has not been included in this DVD set due to licensing issues.  A lot of fans seem to think that this ruins the set as a whole.  However, I bought the collection for the show and the storyline, not for the opening that I only watched a couple times, then skipped for the rest of the series.  While the original intro themes were good, the instrumental that replaces them is far from bad, and the exclusion of the music is hardly an issue that breaks the set as a whole.

The packaging of the series is very nice.  The series box is very easy on the eyes, and the artwork is pretty amazing.  Each DVD is in a slim case, making the box relatively small and easy to manage and store.  The cases themselves have beautiful cover art that depict characters and their respective mobile suits.  All in all, this is one of the best quality packages I have seen.

The set also comes with a few extras:  mobile suit pencil sharpeners and a special poster depicting the Zeta Gundam, Hyaku Shiki, and Psycho Gundam.  The pencil sharpeners are mere novelties and the quality isn't great, but the poster looks rather nice hanging on my wall.

In the end, this set is a must-have for any Gundam fan.  It's a package that isn't without a few minor flaws, but they are easily dismissible when you consider the set as a whole.  I highly recommend it.",1105574400,4,3996,4.572433192686357
2155972,4,B0003JAH0G,"Clearly, some are upset over the fact that the opening and closing songs were omitted.  For me, since I have the BMG (background music) CDs and a HK version of ZG, I can live with this.  My only beef is if (and only if) they messed with the dialog and/or the BMG, then I would demand a refund.  As it appears from others who have purchased this item, they have not touched either BMG or dialog.  Besides, as much as I love the songs, I tend to skip over them to get to the part that counts -- the storyline!

If you really, really miss the songs, go check online auction sites or an online site (maybe here) that sells anime.  Considering how old this show is (~15 years ago), you could be hardpressed to find them.  Maybe you'll luck out.",1104624000,2,739,4.198581560283688
2155973,5,B0003JAH0G,"Mobile Suit Gundam Zeta (or Zeta Gundam, as us old anime fogies are more used to calling it) is, without a doubt, one of the best Anime series ever produced.  It is certainly one of the best Gundam series ever made, and some (including me) would even argue that it is the _best_ Gundam series ever made.

The series picks up five or six years after the original Mobile Suit Gundam.  Most of the main characters from the original series are here, but primarily in supporting roles (including Amuro Ray, MS Gundam's main character) -- except for Char Aznable, who shows up not as a villain but as one of the series' principal heroes.  The main character of this series is Camille Bidan, a troubled, headstrong young man who early on steals a Gundam mobile suit and joins AEUG, a pseudo-rebel movement opposing the increasingly heavy-handed and oppressive Earth government.  Arrayed against AEUG are an elite force of Earth military mobile suit pilots known as The Titans, who are swiftly becoming a law unto themselves and who increasingly view Earth's treatment of her colonies as way too soft.  What follows is a long and sometimes painful coming of age story for Camille, as the young man becomes caught up in the ensuing AEUG-Titans war and the prices to be paid for victory becoming increasingly higher.

This is not ""Backstreet Boys Gundam"" by any stretch.  The lines between good and evil are blurred here, with some characters who were once considered villians fighting alongside our heroes, while some heroes find themselves on the ""bad guys"" side.  There is much drama here, with many twists and turns in the plot, all leading up to one of the best edge-of-your-seat series climaxes ever put together for an anime series.

For those who are used to the more current crop of anime out there, the animation will probably come across as a little choppy, but acceptable.  But don't let the animation quality be a deterrent; the series more than makes up for it in the writing and direction.  Unlike many anime shows in an SF setting, this series makes full use of it's space setting to paint an incredibly rich, detailed and imagined future.  This series is great SF story telling, and deserves its place as one of the best ever produced.

One complaint, however, about Bandai/Sunrise's english edition: they've cut out the original theme songs and replaced them with a piece of semi-stirring background music from the series.  Now, I can understand (sort of) why thy did this, because the original theme songs would probably be considered somewhat hokey today.  But dang it, I _liked_ ""Believe in the Sign of Zeta"", and the second theme was kind of nice in a melancholy way.  Why they didn't include the original opening themes as an ""extra"", I have no idea.  It can't possibly have taken that much more room on the discs.  Grrrrr.  (As for the ending theme song, it is there as the background music that is played at the DVD disc menu).

Anyway, for fans of anime and the various Gundam saga in particular, this is a must have set.",1104364800,28,3037,4.724857685009487
2155974,3,B0003JAH0G,"""Now that the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam DVD boxed set is reaching the hands of consumers it's come to light that the American release of the series has replaced the show's original vocal opening and ending theme songs with instrumental pieces taken from within the show. According to Bandai Entertainment, ""The opening was not changed intentionally, but instead because there were licensing issues when being brought over from Japan. It was a compromise that had to be made in order to release the series here in the states."" Numerous fans have been outraged primarily by the fact that Bandai Entertainment did not reveal the significant change to the series until after it was already reaching customers.

Source: Anime on DVD""

Fans that pre-ordered or bought this boxed set have been betrayed by Bandai because they did not inform us that they have EDITED the opening and closing sequences to this great Anime. As fans of UNEDITED animation, we should be compensated for this vile act of treachery. We paid good money for the TV series that we remembered  as a hallmark in Anime history. The boxed set does not even  come with any extras. I do not want little trinkets(pencil sharpeners)when I much rather see this TV series as it was originally intended!

Bandai has yet to provide a formal statement explaining why this  has occurred. If they truly cared about their fan base(the customers),they would have informed us of the situation earlier and do what was in their power to present us with an UNEDITED ZETA GUNDAM.A recall is in order or at least they could send us a  copy of the original opening and closing sequences.

Many people spent about about $200 dollars for what they thought was the Zeta Gundam that they remembered or heard about. Bandai was more interested in lining there pockets instead of the fans' interests! I am not interested in paying another $200 in the future for a boxed set that is unalter because I believe I already paid for that Zeta Gundam! Bandai should issue a recall or give the customers a disc of extras that contain the original opening and ending credits with the original music intact because BANDAI HID THE FACT THAT THE SERIES WAS EDITED and DID NOT INFORM THE FANS/CUSTOMERS!

2155975,3,B0003JAH0G,"It is one of the best, if not the best gundam series ever.  BUT, for whatever bizarre reason, the original opening and ending songs have been deleted.  WHY???

2155976,5,B0003JAH0G,"I have to say that overall I'm very happy to have this series on DVD format at long last!  I will warn you that the open and closing themes have been replaced by the incidental soundtrack music during the opening/closing animation sequences.  From what I gather on the fan circuit, Bandai was unable to obtain the rights to include the original songs, but don't quote me.  Yes, it urks me too and I'm somewhat miffed at Bandai's omission, but this is not the time to badmouth Bandai.  On the bright side, there is one VERY positive aspect to owning this series on DVD: The video quality is just what you expect for DVD and for an anime series that is nearing it's 20th birthday, and most of all the episodes are UNCUT, UNEDITED (with the exception of the OP/ED music replacement), the original Japanese episodes language track is untouched, unaltered by any stereo enhancement so you can listen to the soundtrack as you remember it when you owned your own raw copies and fansubs on VHS, THE WAY GOD HAD INTENDED!  The English dub track however, was tweaked with stereo enhancement and DOLBY DIGITAL, I have to confess it's very nice coming in through my surround system!  The dubbing and English voice casting is pretty good so far, I have to say I'm both impressed and relieved that they managed to so far maintain the emotion and impact of one of my favorite anime series of all time.  The voices for Camille and Char (Quattro) are pretty darned impressive which makes the English track actually enjoyable to listen to!  I've enjoyed the English voice casting and direction for Gundam Wing, First Gundam, Char's Counterattack, F91 and Gundam Seed; Zeta is no exception!!  The poster and Pencil Sharpeners are a nice touch, I can see it was one of Bandai's marketing schemes yet still nice for treating oneself this holiday season!  Who knows, maybe Bandai will get it together and release another edition down the road with the original songs to accompany the OP/ED title sequences, and I'll buy it all over again when that happens.  For now, I want to go on record as saying YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BEAUTIFUL BOXSET! Zeta Gundam will always be the ""Holy Grail"" of the Gundam phenomena that has entertained me and mesmorized me since discovering the first movie compilation of ""First Gundam"" back in the summer of '82!!

8035959,5,B0003JAH0G,"This box set now in an affordable price features the Limited Edition Box Set which contains:  The 10-DVD Collectible holographic Box Set, 48 pg. Zeta Gundam Encyclopedia, 9 Mobile Suit figurines/sharpeners, and the limited edition poster.

The series is set before U.C. 0093 (Char's Counterattack) and after the defeat of the Principality of Zeon, a faction called the ""AEUG"" formed to resist the Earth Federation's new military group called the ""TITANS.""  The series will also feature characters from the original Mobile Suit Gundam that continue to fight for their beliefs.

I've been a Gundam Fan for a long time and I must say this is one of the best in the series, but it's not my favorite.  The reasons why it isn't because of these things: it can sometimes be odd for the characters to be speaking in a childish tone when they're military, Camille has anger issues, the vocabularies or words can be off at times, and I think that's about it.  But overall, it's still a great series.",1169251200,,989,4.788235294117647
8035960,5,B0003JAH0G,"It's just this simple--ZETA GUNDAM is not only the best GUNDAM series ever, but it is one of the best SF shows I've ever seen.  It can certainly stand shoulder to shoulder with STAR TREK, FARSCAPE, FIREFLY, and the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA in terms of the best ""space based"" science fiction.

  ZETA takes place seven years after the events of MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM and four years after GUNDAM 0083.  Old heroes and new ones join forces to fight the vicious Titans, an offshoot of the Earth Federation that make the SS look like a bunch of amatuers.

  ZETA is similar to the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (or is it the other way around?) in that it is a character-driven science fiction adventure.  Creator/director Yoshiyuki Tomino puts the emphasis on characters with very human frailties.  No one is perfect, and it is difficult to pigeonhole everyone as simply ""good or evil"".  There are loads of space battles, mobile suits, and action both on earth and in space, but, like GALACTICA, there is a sense of realism and believability.  True, the animation is over 20 years old, but it is the STORY that matters.  It draws the viewer in and never lets go.

  The limited edition box set is hard to find, but it is worth the cost.  Fans of good science ficiton television, whether you are an anime fan or not, should watch this series.  Action, adventure, three-dimensional characters--it's all here.  What are you waiting for?",1167436800,,1420,4.745901639344262

The box art was really nice so I felt like putting it on my wall!

8035963,5,B0003JAH0G,"This Gundam saga is the sequel to the original MSG 0079. It was an immense improvement over the first, especially in the final ten episodes or so. The war theme is much more real, the plot is complex and adds a lot more than simply the good guy vs. bad guy concept. It's slightly disappointing how quickly the series ends; the conclusion happens in essentially a matter of seconds! Also, the viewer is left unsure of the state of their hero, Kamille Bidan (the Amuro Ray figure of Zeta). Lastly, it's also noteworthy how Amuro Ray enters Zeta early on and then will disappear from the show strangely without a trace.

8035965,5,B0003JAH0G,"While Mobile Suite Zeta Gundam is not my favorite of the Gundam series it is classic that despite being twenty years old is worth it to own. The good; practically everything great animation good story funny yet serious characters(my favorite is Jerid he tries and tries yet he can never win) , and it has awsome mecha. The only thing I had a problem with were the opening and ending songs, they changed the original songs that were pretty catchy and upbeat. But this series is still worth the price, as I said before it is not my favorite( my personal favorites are Victory gundam , and Turn A Gundam), and I don't recommend this series for people who like Gundam Wing( there would not know a good gundam series if it slapped them). I recommend this series for people who liked the original Gundam and the Universal Century Time line.",1132876800,,834,4.529801324503311
8035966,5,B0003JAH0G,"Just writing that this has become one of my favorite animes ever for a variety of reasons. First of all the story is wonderfully paced and the action is always constant with the storyline and its characters sucking you in. The story is a bit darker compared to other gundams, but it easily stands the test of time maybe not the  animation mind you, but easily everything else does. To get a good idea of what's going on it's best to view ""First Gundam"" (Mobile Suit Gundam) which is also outstanding despite it's age (the movie pack suffices for this need). Bottomline, this anime is worth your time and money (I sprung for the expensive set and haven't looked back :) I watched this series 3 times in the first 3 months that I owned it because it is so outstanding this series and it would difinately get my vote for best Gundam ever and easily top 3 best animes ever.

  For those wishing to continue the story though please check out anime-direct.com in order to be able to download the original japanese version of ZZ Gundam (which hasn't been released in the States)which follows immediately after Zeta Gundam this one is more lighthearted but not quite as good as Zeta Gundam although it is a really solid series. Anyways if you call yourself a scifi or even an anime fan Zeta Gundam will NOT disappoint you.",1131667200,,1314,4.531645569620253
