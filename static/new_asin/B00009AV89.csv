1882413,5,B00009AV89,"This series is ABSOLUTELY HILLARIOUS (only in Japanese with English subtitles) If you think Excel Saga is funny, this is almost that funny.

The Dubb is atrocious. Watch an episode in English & Japanese & tell me that the English voice actors don't completely suck & KILL THE HUMOR. The following voices suck in English; Mr. Nanohana, Bantaro, Ozaru, Kozaru, Shiro's is okey, Jiyu's is ill-fitting, Lord Jubei doesn't sound old enough, Ryuujouji's is actually a vast improovement, & KOINOSUKE'S IS UNFORGIVABLY BAD!

Yes, the dubb is truely aweful, the voices are just terrible. A pitty there isn't a complete set of sub-only, & the subs aren't as good as the fansubs. (for those of you lacking in otakuness, a fansub used to be the only way we could get some animes & latter became the prefured alternative to dub-only VHS releases) Thank goodness for dual-language DVDs.... After years & years, JC1 is still one of my top 3 favorites & I prefur it heavily over season 2. If you enjoy the spastic humor of Jubei-chan, you should also enjoy Comic Party, Sukikage Kuromatei High, Azumanga Daioh, & Abenobashi Mahou Shotengai.",1094947200,7,1124,4.87958115183246
1882414,2,B00009AV89,"This is one of those slapstick try to be funny but is far from it anime series. The series is missing a plot and the characters are not interesting. The only thing worth watching is the fight scenes witch are pretty well done. The artwork is purposly bad at times and the character talk to the camera and complain about how badly they are being drawn. Its just really stupid, and I cant see how any one could find humor in it.",1074470400,4,426,4.2073170731707314
1882415,4,B00009AV89,"Yagyu Jube Mitsuyoshi (1607-1650) was a swordsman with a reputation as a swashbuckler and also a man of mystery.  There are many legends and tales surrounding this man, a man who disappeared for 12 years, which only added to the fires of rumor.  Many believe that during this time, after being dismissed from the Shogun's service, that he in fact continued to work as an agent.  The Yagyu was a family known for their swordsman they produced and Jube was the last of the line (and many feel the best).  The best known story of his adventures was his duel with dummy swords (which was later used in 'The Seven Samurai').
The DVDs take this story and add to it.  They continue the tale, saying that Jube left behind an eyepatch that held all his skills and that Koinosuke, his loyal retainer, must find the right person to give it to.  The poor guy ends up searching 300 years before finding Jiyu Nanohama, nicknamed Jubei, and giving it to her.
And then the story gets weird!
Great story, the artwork can be very good AND silly.  Extras and Easter Eggs in each DVD and you can feel the enjoyment that went into making the set.  Not as many laughs as some and sometimes it tried to be serious (which only worked once and a while- they just did too good a job with the humor and silliness for the serious stuff to stick).  Feels kind of thin, as most background characters, settings and details are simple - the plot is all and nothing will get in its way.
Oh, and lots of sword fighting!  Magic, some focus on female chests and love letters.
I would suggest getting it used if you can.  Some parts are fine for kids, yet some parts have inside jokes and mature issues only an adult would understand.  Why is it so many moms die before the story even starts in some of the anime I have?  Tenchi Muyo, Strawberry Eggs, and now this one!",1059091200,10,1832,4.368731563421829

7990404,5,B00009AV89,I was looking for a strong female lead character in an anime and I finally found it in this collection. It's like the weakness of sailor moon combined with some scenes from the slayers which make the battles epic,1418083200,,212,4.461538461538462

7990407,4,B00009AV89,"Other reviewers have been ragging on this title quite heavily. I agree - if you are looking for a historical-based, deep plotted, good art styled anime about martial arts, then look somewhere else.

However, I really enjoyed Jubei-chan. It was more of a spoof of anime than anything else. Some moments of drama, but mostly poking fun at the serious martial art types of anime. The characters are goofy, and it is a bit racy at times, so its definately not for kids under 15 or so.

The soundtrack is awesome, and I absolutely loved the fight scenes (moreso towards the end of the series). It does move kinda slow towards the beginning (to introduce the characters), but with the last two discs especially, I could not pull myself away.",1164499200,2,735,4.6461538461538465
7990408,2,B00009AV89,If you actually looking for ninja's in this anime by the end of this anime you either feel stupid or really angry. This is not based on any ninja's what so ever besides one which they made fun off. Which was Hattori Hanzo. How dare they mock such a great man like that. There is actually one charcter you might actually like in this story. He dies at the begin of the series. Yet and afterwards its a story going downhill that can't stick to the plot. Some people might call this comedy but i just call it something sad. This story is more like sailor moon without a deep storyline and a snotty girl that has a very hard time conprehending situations of common sense. Which is understandable why some people might like it as they may relate to this character. The fight schenes they will be actually about 4 fight schenes you might come across for the fact that it really doesnt contain that much action. the rest would be 3 second battles as in every episode will have one. What i actually see here is the story that i despite so much for using the term ninja on the title. The main character will be a swordsman aided by a cowardly samurai(which wouldn't make any sense any if a samurai would be a servant to a ninja anyways). Jubei will have many classmates in which the story won't revolve around but they will be there and they shall be anoying for the except of the kendo braggin kid which they story will revolve around. This anime has great music production and artwork but it lacks in character development and story which is basically worth nothing if you don't have those in my opinion having a story that you won't care about and characters you don't care about makes you wonder why your are still watching it. They thing i actually like was jubei's battle uniform which is the only reason why I didn't give it 1 star.,1144281600,,1830,4.385294117647059
7990409,2,B00009AV89,"The first time I heard of Jubei-chan: Secret of the Lovely Eye patch I thought it sounded pretty cool. I mean who wouldn't like an action/adventure romance of a girl who can transform into a kick-ass ninja? However I was sorely disappointed. Not only was the plot line shaky and the voice acting terrible but what really hits the nail on the head was Jubei's character. She is completely empty of emotion whatsoever, in both ninja and ordinary girl form. She has an empty-headed trait that really gets annoying. Like for instance, she fights and defeats all of her teachers who are really ninja's in disguise and yet she wonders why her class gets so many new teachers ... well duh Jubei! You defeated them! Also all of the other characters are to busy ogling at her chest to really carry any significance to the story. I thought the action scenes might make up for the story line, and they are beautiful but really, really short. I usually like giving things a chance even if the other reviews aren't in favor but I'm sorry to say that I regret buying this DVD set. The only reason I give it two stars is for the fact that the soundtrack is beautiful and Jubie's ninja character looks pretty cool, but other than that it's pretty lame.",1143936000,,1236,4.522321428571429
7990410,5,B00009AV89,"The main conflict of this story is between two rival Japanese sword schools: the Yagyu Jubei school and the Ryujoji school. The rivalry was seemingly ended 300 years ago when Yagyu Jubei defeated the Ryujoji champion.

Rating 13 up: minor risque humor, violence",1126656000,,261,5.069767441860465
7990411,1,B00009AV89,"I hate to be the one to have to let you know,but this anime is garbage. I don't review(this being my 1rst)but I had to let you know. I'm not sure I can even describe this appalling attempt at anime. Artwork was trash,dialog was trash,story line(had there been one)was trash. Rated 13andUp I sat down to watch this with my daughter thinking it would be a cute anime and a good chance to further her interest in martial arts. To my horror the entire anime revolved around Jubei-Chan's breasts and every male in the show's obsession with them. Including her father! Her father is even so moved that he decides to strip Jubei,and himself,and lay on top of her repeatedly""because she had a fever"". Though young boy's interest might be peaked,sorry no fanservice. Just poor camera shots of poorly drawn characters. In closing,sorry for ranting,the fight scenes were a plus. But most are less then 1-3 seconds and far from making this a worthwhile experience. If you have to see for yourself, then I advise at least skip the first disc,maybe 2. The story did start to come around just a little before the end.",1107561600,3,1102,4.656410256410257
