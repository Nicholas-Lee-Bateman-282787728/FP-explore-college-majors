2867425,4,B000FVQYPY,"Much respect to Toby Russell for raising the profile of Taiwan kung fu movies and continuining his relentless quest to restore long lost prints (some of which seem to have been gathering cobwebs in the cellars of the stars and directors in Taiwan). Although not Don Wong's best movie (it gets bogged down with a lot of silliness in the middle) this one does feature some cracking fight scenes in the final half hour and looks great in widescreeen.

The real joy here is the commentary - a chat between Toby and Don. I was delighted to find out how articulate and amusing Don is using English and so he is able to give us a unique insight into how kung fu movies were produced in the seventies - for example, wrapping up shooting in under a month! Toby asks some smart questions - but there's a rather annoying omission - we never get to learn about Don Wong's real martial arts background. It was rather sad to learn that Don's talented choreographer and close friend Tommy Lee disappeared into obscurity in the States (as far as anyone knows, he is working in a Chinese restaurant) when other choreographers such as Yuen Wo-Ping made it as big time action directors in Hollywood. There are also fascinating references to the shooting locations - for those familiar with the geography of Taiwan.",1157068800,4,1295,4.630434782608695
