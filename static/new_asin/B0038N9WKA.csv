8391565,3,B0038N9WKA,"Supposedly based on an Alexandre Dumas' novel, this film is just another standardized swashbuckler with nominal swash and not much to buckle.  Robin Hood, misplayed by Jon Hall, is pretty bland.  He portrays the character light and loose, making all his dialog sound humorous when it's not.  There are three damsels in varying degrees of distress.  (One's betrothed to one guy, forced to marry another.  One's captured and forced to marry another guy.  They must have been desperate for marriageable women in those days.)  There's the requisite number of duels, jailbreaks, the bad guys organize a hanging for entertainment sake..........  Robin sends a Friar to spy for him at the castle.  ""Hide the wine, it's a monk.""  I think they bought their costumes at Robin Hoods R Us.  They look fairly typical to what other Robins wore.
I'm not sure but I think this was aimed at children.  It is a bit on the silly side.  But it's all good natured fun for everyone, except for the bad guys who were shot or stabbed.",1395360000,,1010,4.735632183908046
8391566,3,B0038N9WKA,"Robin Hood comes to the aid of A man and his sister not realizing what he just got himself in for. The man is to marry the daughter of A Noble man,but robin suspects maybe the future father in law may not want the man for A son in law which leads to A very action fill movie.",1365120000,,275,3.7586206896551726
8391567,5,B0038N9WKA,"tis is an excellent robin hood movie with great old time actors in that was made during the golden years of hollywood
i would recommend this one to all who like stories of robin hood and maid marian",1355097600,,198,4.2368421052631575
8391568,3,B0038N9WKA,"This is a very average movie in all aspects.  The acting is not outstanding.  The directing was not outstanding.  It is a very average movie.  It is not one I will care to see a second time.  Jon Hall's portrayal of Robin Hood is fairly poor.  The costumes are close to cartoonish in some ways.  It is a fun film in some ways.  In others, you won't miss much by not seeing this one.  ""The Rogues of Sherwood Forest"" was wayyyyyy better.  That is the other one of this series that I have seen that I do recommend.",1302393600,,512,4.13265306122449
8391569,2,B0038N9WKA,"Bad acting, bad scenery, bad plot, bad fighting, HORRIBLE ending!  They have a mass marriage at the end because everyone HAS to find their true love in this story, then just before they kiss their wives, they're called away to the crusades and they just jump on horses and ride off into the sunset.  That is the worst plot I've ever seen.  Save yourself the hour of your life and spend it doing something worthwhile.  The plot doesn't really focus on Robin -he's trying to save someone ELSE'S girlfriend- and all of the women in the movie are dragged around LITERALLY by men.  They are pulled onto horses and molested more than three times that I recall; like a sack of potatoes or a child.  Don't waste your money.  The costumes are totally not period -nice hat Marian- and the only woman that speaks her mind is a ... ""loose-woman"" we'll say.  There are plenty of other fantastic or slightly better movies of Robin to be seen, go find one.",1301011200,,941,4.4941176470588236
8391570,3,B0038N9WKA,"If you are a student of the Bandit of Sherwood, love Renaissance Fairs, read Chaucer (or Alexandre Dumas, whose writings 'inspired' this film) for fun, and take 12th and 13th century English history seriously, you might prefer to 'pass' on this production...from the opening moments, when tall, somewhat portly Jon Hall (in red boots!) intones Robin Hood's first lines...with a slight drawl...on the most 'Southern California'-looking ""Sherwood Forest"" set I've ever seen, with 'Merry Men' straight out of 'B' westerns, I knew that back in 1947, Errol Flynn wasn't losing any sleep over this version of his greatest role! That being said, on it's own merits as a 'programmer', made as light entertainment for post-war audiences, it really isn't bad...'groan'-able, certainly, but diverting, for kids, and no worse than Cornell Wilde or John Derek's Robin Hood films.

Producer Sam Katzman was a master at creating these low-budget films, often for 'bargain basement' studios, like Monogram; working at Columbia, even on a tiny budget, was a definite improvement, and having the redoubtable Hall (who'd rocketed to fame in John Ford's ""The Hurricane"", and was Universal's biggest wartime action star, in a string of 'Arabian Nights'-inspired 'B' movies), was a plus, as well. Columbia filmmaking offered another benefit; respected character actors in supporting roles, such as Alan Mowbray as the 'Friar Tuck' character, and H.B. Warner as Robin's adopted father. The leading ladies (Patricia Morison and Adele Jurgens) could both actually act, as well (not always the case, at Monogram).

The story, of Robin aiding a returning Crusader in saving his 'Lady Fair' from an unwanted wedding (while wooing Lady Marion, who is introduced in a G-rated nude woodland swim...a common theme in several 'Hood' films), is basically just a framework for frequent action scenes (and the opportunity to enjoy Jon Hall's more slender stunt double at work). There's archery, there's flailing about with swords (I'm reluctant to call it fencing), there's the climactic fight at the castle (involving all twenty of the film's 'extras'), and the verbal 'fencing' between Robin and Marion, with a happy ending (of course!) Nothing that would shock or distress...or remember for long, after the film ends, either. A 'safe', wholesome movie to enjoy with your younger children (who will probably love it!)

""Prince of Thieves"" is an engaging view of family entertainment from a different era...",1289347200,8,2472,5.333333333333333
