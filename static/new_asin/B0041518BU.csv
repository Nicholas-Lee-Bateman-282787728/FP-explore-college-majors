It takes place in Tiera del Fuego, We normally think of South America as a hot place. .In this movie, however, we get to see the snow covered landscape and how people live there. I thought it was pretty good.",1475539200,,280,4.403846153846154

The main character is a seaman working on some sort of freight ship.  Like many sailors, he lives isolated life on his ship and has no friends.  His life is so mundane that it seems to be dragging indefinitely.  Once the ship reaches southernmost part of Argentina, seaman asks captain for permission to see his elderly mother who lives in a small remote village and who has not seem in many years.  This is kind of Argentina I did not see before.  I was in Buenos Aires once, so for me personally  it was amazing to see the beautiful countryside of the southern part of the country completely covered in snow and yet still breathtaking in its natural beauty.

It is obvious that this man lived in a really small, remote village.  There is no transportation of any kind to reach the place and on his trip he hitchhikes rides and walks most of the time.  His companions are a bottle of harsh alchohol and cigarettes.  Once he reaches his birthplace, seaman meets his mother who is old and ailing.  There is something unspoken that happened here and director never brings it up on the surface.  There is a mysterious girl who is mentally challenged and it is unclear if he is seaman's sister or a daughter.  And after all that effort of walking and travelling for days, he hands over to his family some money, a handful of trinkets and eventually leaves to return to the ship.

The only comment his family has after seaman leaves is ""Thank God, he is gone.""  One has to wonder - is it a relief to be rid of him and his presence, or is it a desire of any parent who wants a better life for their child than a life in a desolate country with no prospect of job and easy life.  Could it really be that they believe that seaman has a much better life on sea, traveling the world, living all alone in his ship cabin, nursing his loneliness with drink and occasional call girl?  Maybe it is, because they really do not know the reality of his empty life.  Seaman's life is as empty and hopeless as the countryside where his family lives.

After watching this movie, you will find yourself asking more questions of what director was really trying to say than finding answers from the story.  It is not an easy film to watch and it will leave you dazed and confused.",1421884800,,2485,4.401315789473684

They are without question challenging and those who have only known traditional narrative or Hollywood films will either open their minds to the experience or reject them out of hand. This is not a spoon fed story giving you all the answers. It is slow, messy & unresolved, like life. Beautifully shot & edited, I cannot forget my emotions at the last shot. Don't read other reviews unless you want spoilers.",1377302400,3,505,4.75
