8126291,3,B000FT78B0,"Part 2 of a 1997 independent wrestling show taped in Livingston, NJ.  This DVD features more aging superstars still putting on an entertaining show for the fans.  Dubbed crowd noise aside, this is still entertaining with the late ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie's performance of his hit song ""Pencil-Neck Geek"" (yes, it actually was a hit - at least on Dr. Demento's show) being the true highlight, in my opinion.  Again, Michael Omansky and Ken Patera take up commentating duties for the following segments:

1. A Musical Interlude: Nikolai Volkoff sings (read: badly lip-synchs) his version of ""Cara Mia"" from the 1985 Wrestling Album, and ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie performs ""Pencil-Neck Geek.""
2. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Nikolai Volkoff
3. Maccabiah Heavyweight Title Match - Champion The Iron Sheik vs. The Mighty Maccabee

As stated, the highlight is Freddie Blassie, but Nikolai and Bam Bam manage to pull off an okay match.  The Sheik tries to entertain the crowd in his match with the Mighty Maccabee, who is, in fact, not a wrestler, but Olympic fencing champion Jeff Kubantz in a mask.  I enjoyed the DVD for what it is, an indy show with over the hill stars still doing what they love.

8126292,5,B000FT78B0,"This stuff is classic wrestling SCHLOCK! It is a match from 1997 I believe, in a high school gymnasium. The Sheik against the Mighty Maccabbee, for something called the Maccabean Championship. The Sheik hasn't lost a step, he is still hilarious, and full of fun! He yells at the disinterested kids and parents about 6 times not to shout ""U-S-A"" and they dont. The Mighty Maccabee is not a pro wrestler, he is some kind of Olympian Fencer. The fact that he doesnt know how to wrestle only adds to the charm of this fabulous DVD. Oh my God, it is great stuff, Sheik even does the Persian Club challenge, and sweats a lot. A bloated Ken Patera in a sweatsuit waddles around the ring, trying to look intimidating. The end is straight out of an Ed Wood flick. This is the ""Plan 9"" of all wrestling DVDs, and more entertaining than the last three Wrestlemanias COMBINED. Highly recommended if you watched wrestling in the 80's.",1165536000,7,921,4.554216867469879
8126293,2,B000FT78B0,"Grandmasters of Wrestling Vol. 1 gave us part of an independently produced wrestling show from 1997 which took place in a high school gym in New Jersey.  The show was noteworthy in that it featured several ex-stars from the WWF (now WWE).  Vol. 2 gives us the rest of that show, including the main event.

The DVD begins with Nikolai Volkoff lip-synching (they insist he is singing) his version of ""Cara Mia"" from the original WWF music album (wonder how they skirted the copyright issue).  He then sings (for real) ""Hava Nagila.""  For those of us who recall Volkoff singing the Soviet national anthem before each match in the 80's, this segment will fill you with nostalgia, even as you cringe.

Next, ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie hobbles out to sing his opus, ""Pencil Necked Geek.""  Blassie's physical limitations (brought on by years of bumping in the ring) are obvious, but he still has the old Blassie wit and showmanship.

The first actual match pits Nikolai Volkoff against Bam Bam Bigelow.  Volkoff knows his technical holds and does a fair job showing them off.  Unfortunately, we get to see little of the speed and agility that the huge Bigelow used to wow us with back in the day (one gets the impression he is somewhat embarrased to be there).  Overall a mediocre match.

Next comes a backstage interview with the Iron Sheik.  The Sheik was always a great talker, and this time is no exception.  Sadly, the Sheik sports a huge beer belly and moves stiffly, suggesting that his ring performance isn't going to be what it used to be.

Now we get to the main event.  The Iron Sheik comes to the ring, accompnaied by ""Iron"" Mike Sharp and his manger, Ali Ben Shnore (stereotypes in pro wrestling?  Hey, some things never chnage).  He then does his patenented demonstration of swinging his exercise clubs, offering $1,000 to anyone who can duplicate his swings after the match.  This was a regular feature when the Sheik worked indy shows.

Then we are introduced to the challenger, a local favorite (you can tell because we see the crowd actually clap for a change, rather than hearing badly dubbed cheers).  He is a fencer known as the Mighty Maccabee.  They are wrestling for the Maccabee championship belt (whatever that is).

I don't know how good a fencer the MM is, but he clearly knows nothing about pro wrestling.  At one point he tried to put the Sheik in a sleeper hold, resulting in a hilarious interval of struggling to wrap his arms around the Sheik's head.  As for the Sheik, we see nothing of the various suplexes he used to use in the day.  Despite this, he is clearly trying to put on a good show.  He tells the crowd 6 times (!) not to yell ""USA,"" using reverse psychology to try to fire them up (it doesn't work, but you can't say he didn't try).

Like Vol. 1, Vol. 2 features mainly wrestlers past their prime but who are still knowledgable about showmanship and generally enthusiastic, duking it out in a cut-rate indy show for a group of kids and their bored parents.  Would I have put myself out to get these DVD's?  Probably not.  Still, I paid $1 each for both volumes at Wal-Mart, and consider it money well spent.",1152230400,5,3144,4.590664272890485
