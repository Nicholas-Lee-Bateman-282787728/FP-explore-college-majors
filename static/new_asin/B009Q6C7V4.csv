5360822,3,B009Q6C7V4,"This was kind of an enjoyable fun film, nothing that is going to change (or save!) the world, though.  The film was about 3/4 over before I realized that one of the cars had KY plates, and at the end I saw it was filmed right here in Louisville...wow, I didn't recognize any of the locations.

The best part of the film is the dialogue, really, lots of good one-liners and most of the humor is pretty snide.  For the action stuff though, especially when battling the mutated alien zombie things, most of the shots are so dark that you can't really tell what you're looking at, so I found that segment to be rather a waste....and that does go on for a bit.

Anyway, this is entertaining, it's just not a film that will become a classic or change your life....and if you live in Louisville, you might even recognize some of the scenery...I didn't.

5360823,5,B009Q6C7V4,"It was Shakespeare who said, ""Kill all the lawyers"". He may have been right, at least when it comes to those who specialize in using legal loopholes and the `old-boys' network to get criminals off the hook. Of course, there are other means of dealing with criminals the system can't touch. Chun (Joel Grey) from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remo-Williams-The-Adventure-Begins/dp/B000092Q5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins</a>"" expressed it best when he said, ""Assassination is the highest form of public service"" in reference to the execution of those who think they are above the law. Filmmakers Matt Niehoff and Brian Cunningham follow that idea as the starting point for their film ""Overtime"".

Attorney Samantha Carter (Katie Stewart) specializes in using all the legal tricks at her disposal to get some of the worst criminals in Louisville released. Of course, she is extremely well paid for this, and she in turn puts that money to good use, paying hitmen Raph (Al Snow) and Max (John Wells) to take out these criminals.

Raph and Max may be hitmen, but first they are friends and partners. Their relationship reminds one of the really good buddy-action flicks from the 80's and 90's, like the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. They exchange casual banter and Max, the younger single man, is a welcome member of Raph's family. Unfortunately for Raph, that family is causing him some serious problems. It's his son's birthday and Raph has to come up with an awesome present, a cake for the party... oh and a clown. Maybe if it was his day off that would be one thing, but he and Max have to take out the supplier for a drug operation.

As Raph and Max work to solve all of the birthday related problems, they also track their target to a warehouse/chemical laboratory. They enter the building not really knowing what to expect, but being attacked by zombies with nasty, infection-spreading stingers on their shoulders was definitely not it.  The duo end up trapped with a group of scientists including Stephanie (Sebrina  Siegel), Monica  (Erica Goldsmith) and Greg (James Tackett). Greg it turns out is their target, but they can't just take him; the chemical Greg has been adding to the drugs he is supplying is actually the cause of the zombie infestation in the lab. To make it worse, these aren't just any zombies; the source of the chemical is of extraterrestrial origin. That's right, they're zombie aliens!

So now Raph and Max have to figure out a way to stop the zombie aliens, or zaliens, from escaping the lab and spreading their infection to the entire world. And they only have an hour to do it or they'll be late for Raph's son's party and that would be the end of his world.

""Overtime"" is a movie that really tries to jam it all into one: it's an action flick, it's a comedy, it's a zombie movie, and it's a buddy film. Normally, trying to combine this many elements into one movie would not work, but filmmakers Niehoff and Cunningham manage to pull it off. The humor works, the action is fun, and they bring in plenty of laughs and a few surprises to boot.

Perhaps ""Overtime's"" biggest strength is the on screen relationship between Raph and Max. Al Snow and John Wells bring fantastic chemistry to the screen. Their banter is witty and has that rare ring of truth to it that shows a real connection between the actors. Wells and Snow also exhibit excellent comedic timing, managing to keep the humor real and not forced. ""Overtime"" is essentially a buddy film that has zombies, aliens, hitmen, and clowns as icing on the birthday cake. While ""Overtime"" doesn't bring a lot of new material to any of the genres it mixes together, the way it mixes them is what makes the original in its own way. So check out Matt Niehoff and Brian Cunningham's ""Overtime"". It's a fun mish-mash that will leave you hoping for more of the adventures of Raph and Max... and with an unnatural craving for birthday cake.... I F****** love cake!",1357689600,2,4012,4.853801169590644
5360824,4,B009Q6C7V4,"Raphael (Al Snow) and Max (John Wells) are hitmen who kill bad guys after they confide in defense attorney Samantha Carter (Katie Stewart) and she gets them off. Raph has a normal family life and it is his son's birthday. His wife tasks him with getting a clown, a cake, and a gift at the last minute. He stops by to see Samantha to get paid, but she has one more task for our duo to perform.

Our guys have their own grindhouse swagger music that is interrupted by a phone call from the wife (Cristina Mullins). Unable to secure a clown at the last minute, they employ a drunk homeless man (Sean Saunders), someone who is a ""Bobcat"" light. Raph with his ""Steven Seagal looking pony tail"" and Max enter a Kentucky warehouse to do one last job only to be confronted by zombie type humans under alien control.

Overall the acting was bad, although it did win awards at the Louisville Fright Night Film Fest, go figure.

At one point in an elevator Ralp calls Max ""Ray"" for some reason. The dialouge was humorous, but not rip roaring funny. A fun popcorn film. John Wells did win an award for this film ""Best one liner"" although I can't say what it was. The film had a number of good one liners.

5360838,5,B009Q6C7V4,"Great movie. Especially for being an independent, low budget film.

If you aren't a stickler for high-def, perfect angle filming with over-the-top CGI, I definitely suggest giving this movie a try. It has that classic movie feel where most character focus is on the two mains and everyone else is just there. Which is nice as it doesn't drag down the action and flow of the movie by having to hear the life stories of all characters. It gives you what you need to know to follow the plot of the movie from beginning to end.

The two mains are hilarious and have a good chemistry with each other, as well as their employer. Know that there's a lot of cursing in this, plenty of f-bombs. This movie also doesn't rely on TnA shots to keep eyes glued to the screen, something I greatly appreciate. Other than some busty cleavage and comments from the pervy main, that's about it.

If you're in the mood for something like a zom-com, this is worth the viewing time. I ended up re-watching it the next day with my fianc, hehe.",1483920000,3,1020,4.44385026737968

Made it through first 20 minutes and THAT was a waste of time. acting - 2 stars, plot - 1 star, special effects - 1 star, anticipating watching movie after sooooo many great reviews and being totally let down - 2 stars, script - 1 star, characters - 1 star. How many is that? if there were a  - 3 rating that would be it.",1372982400,3,389,3.9240506329113924
5360916,5,B009Q6C7V4,"Movies like Overtime is why I am addicted to B horror films. After watching far too many B-movie abominations recently, along comes Overtime and renews my faith in independent horror. I loved the characters, the writing was clever, and this felt like a film with a much higher budget than it apparently had. I noticed about half way through that I waas smiling like a little kid at Christmas as I was watching the movie unfold, and that smile never left me until the end of the credits...highly recommended for those who don't mind a little silliness mixed in with their B-horror!",1372291200,,580,4.696078431372549

5360921,5,B009Q6C7V4,As the title of the review says a really fun movie from start to finish . I was impressed with the quality from production which far exceeded what I thought an Indy/ scifi/horro/ buddy film would have ( granted some things  still looked Indy but hey ) to the acting ( not Oscar worthy but good ) to a unique story that was well paced . The chemistry between Raph & Max is what sells it .Would love to see more of these 2 together.,1361664000,,430,4.0588235294117645
5360922,5,B009Q6C7V4,"This movie is well put together, and on a shoestring budget I might add. You can't go wrong with zombies. If you like zombie movies, you'll like this movie.",1360886400,,156,4.413793103448276
5360923,5,B009Q6C7V4,"As soon as the words, ""independent film"" are uttered, expectations always shift in my mind as I brace myself for underwhelming acting, often inconsistent plots and really woeful special effects.  What a pleasant feeling then to have my expectations snapped the other way by this completely and utterly awesome film.  Al Snow and John Wells play off each other to great effect as Raphael and Max, a pair of chatty assassins on the payroll of a lawyer friend who gets really nasty clients off in order discretely bump them off at a latter point.  Naturally, when the guys have to work overtime on the weekend, this creates marital tensions for Raph, who has to cough up with cake, present and clown for his son's birthday by the end of the day.  Things go south very quickly once the pair realize that the job lined up by their boss involves ""non-terrestrial fluid"".  Again, as independent movies go, this was way above the norm.  Once you get past the two main characters, however, the other mostly women parts seems almost wooden in comparison.  This might be due to the fact that all the good lines get mouthed by Snow and Wells.  Still, when all is said and done, Overtime is absolutely worth the rental or purchase.  The only thing left to make this the perfect story would be if some drunk, homeless, guy were to get dressed up as a clown and then get mauled by a pack of kids.  Oh, wait......",1360368000,9,1397,4.552

8543685,5,B009Q6C7V4,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best written.

Don't let all the hallmarks of a B movie fool you- this is an A+ movie on an A- budget.  The cast can act, the dialog between the two had me snarfing, and the drunken homeless guy dressed as a clown being chased by a horde of children makes it worth watching alone.

Give it at least 15 minutes.  You'll believe.  Try watching to the end without laughing out loud.",1509062400,,455,4.067415730337078
8543686,5,B009Q6C7V4,"In most respects, this is a slightly above average low-budget sci-fi action flick. Plot, acting, effects, production, are all decent, but what sets Overtime apart and makes it really memorable are the two main characters, Raph & Max. They have a ton of charm and chemistry. They are always amusing and have a dozen or more quote-worthy lines that are laugh out loud funny. The subplot involving Raph's son's birthday, and Raph & Max's concern for it in the face of alien horrors make them super-likable and sympathetic. The minor characters pull their weight, too.

8543687,4,B009Q6C7V4,"Okay, not traditional zombies, but this was just a fun movie. I'm not a wrestling fan so I wasn't familiar with Al Snow et al, but for this genre this movie was refreshing. The acting was really solid, with even the hammy parts being intentionally hammy. The cast works very well together, especially our buddy-assassins, with great chemistry. It was a refreshing take on some staid genre archetype characters. Well-recommended.",1501977600,,428,5.128571428571429
8543688,5,B009Q6C7V4,"Laugh out loud funny.  Some great lines, decent camera work, and OK SFX.  Wells steals the show,  Snow does a serviceable job,  and the original score moves things along.

8543689,4,B009Q6C7V4,"""Overtime"" is a cheap, cheesy, not well-acted, stupid movie starring one of the more fun to watch wrestlers out there. And like the star, Al Snow, it's about a thousand times more entertaining to watch than it has any right to be. It's so cheap and cheese-filled that it *almost* borders on brilliant.
