8305314,4,B001GGBCRC,"Louis Malle may be one of the greatest film directors of all time.  Looking at his healthy filmography, there are only a few noticeable missteps, but they are easily lost in the shuffle of sheer greatness.  `Murmur of the Heart', `Elevator to the Gallows', `Lancombe Lucien', `My Dinner with Andre', `Au Revoir Les Enfants'...and yet most people look `Pretty Baby' as definitive Malle, which is a total shame.

`The Thief of Paris' is not my favorite Malle, but that only means that I don't think it's a masterpiece.  The film is still astonishingly good, and Malle really takes himself, his cast and his audience in a different direction than he is used to, thus proving once again the man's impeccable range.

This period drama follows a young man, George Randal, who is brought up by a wealthy yet obviously greedy uncle.  Swindled out of his rightful fortunes and separated from his cousin, who he wishes to marry, George turns to a life of crime to rebuild his cash flow and win her hand.  Through the course of the film, things change, circles are penetrated and love is tossed aside for the thrill of the crime.  Jean-Paul Belmondo is remarkably convincing as George, a young man turned criminal masquerading as an aristocrat of sorts.  Slipping in and out of bed with one beautiful woman after another, and still seeking the affections of the one he left behind, George is a complicated fellow, but the grand climax regarding his final decision is the one that makes the largest impact.

Malle directs with restraint and meticulous dedication, and Belmondo is supported by a talented cast that includes Genevieve Bujold, Marie Dubois and Christian Lude.  It isn't as impactful, due to the film's quiet demeanor, but at the end of the day it flows with elegance and definitely entertains and engages.",1379980800,2,1807,4.85342019543974
8305315,3,B001GGBCRC,"After his uncle (Christian Lude) spends his inheritance, a young man (Jean Paul Belmondo) steals some jewels out of retaliation. He finds he gets a thrill and embarks on a life as a professional thief. I don't know why but with its elegant turn of the century setting, I was expecting this Louis Malle film to be a romp along the lines of VIVA MARIA. Far from it, the film is a painstaking look at the life of a professional their, there are stretches without dialogue as we watch Belmondo and his comrades applying their skills. The film also shows us the underbelly of a ""secret"" society of thieves, who help each other and form deep bonds with each other, honor among thieves as it were. While I appreciate the effort, it eventually becomes soporific (though that might have been the flu). With Genevieve Bujold looking like a Dresden doll in her 19th century costumes, Charles Denner, Marlene Jobert, Francoise Fabian, Julien Guiomar and Bernadette Lafont.

The South American DVD is in French with optional English and Spanish subtitles. It's handsome looking wide screen (1.77 transfer).",1358899200,2,1093,4.876344086021505
