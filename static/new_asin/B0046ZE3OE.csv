4271278,1,B0046ZE3OE,"Not sure what this was but it wasn't a Tai Chi video. It is a gentle workout based on Tai Chi, but it sure doesn't teach you much about proper Tai Chi. I feel like the Title is very misleading.",1521849600,,193,3.85
4271279,4,B0046ZE3OE,Easy to follow and 2 different workouts. Not too strenuous for a 65 year old out of shape woman. But I wish he had a couple more workouts on the dvd.,1521417600,,149,3.838709677419355

After some ladies in my town started a exercise session, I took my CD with me and showed it to the ladies which all was in the age between 6o and 80. Everyone loved it and now we do this Thai chi 3 Times a week .

4271292,3,B0046ZE3OE,"This has a lot of good stretching and strengthening exercises for core muscles, but it really isn't Tai Chi. I took classes for two years and this has no Tai Chi forms, even beginning ones. I was disappointed in this. It won't help with balance the way Tai Chi does. This is a little more like yoga.",1515456000,,299,4.2631578947368425

4271294,4,B0046ZE3OE,"Easy, relaxing, yet a good workout. My only complaint is that it's not as long as my other workout DVDs. They do offer other parts you can go to to learn more and so forth but the actual workout is kind of short. I do like that they have an elderly lady to also do the exercises, that does encourage me. The guy who is the host is real calm and seems like a real gentleman. Nice studio. I enjoy this DVD especially when I just want an easy but meaningful workout.",1513555200,,463,4.043478260869565

4271298,2,B0046ZE3OE,Very easy Tai Chi tape but I only used it once as I can't bend my knees and keep them bent for more than a few seconds as I have had total knee replacement on both knees and it's just too uncomfortable.  I'll stick with my chair yoga stretching exercises with a DVD tape that I purchased years ago by Peggy Cappy.  It helps me more than any other DVD that I have ordered.,1510876800,,371,4.0

4271337,5,B0046ZE3OE,"We bought several DVDs of Tai Chi before this one.  The first fellow dwelled forever on details of each movement.  The second moved right into heavy duty stuff that we didn't fully get.

Enter this series - just right.  Easy to remember exercises with neat names helps me to remember them.

This is the best series of several that we have purchased.  We have since purchased others in the series.",1497657600,2,396,4.585714285714285

I have been doing Tai Chi with this DVD (morning and evening) every other day for a week now. There is nothing in the standing or chair routines that I cannot do.

It's still early days yet, but I am noticing a little relaxation in muscles that have been tense and knotted for a long time. My pain and anxiety levels have dropped a bit and I am sleeping better.",1497139200,13,538,4.37

4271350,5,B0046ZE3OE,I purchased this form my grandma who is 82. She is in very good shape for her age and very active. She enjoys this exercise. She said it is a bit slow but that it's good because it trains her to really think about her movements. There was only one movement she couldn't not do due to it bothering her hip.

We are newcomers to Tai Chi and cannot compare it with any other such workouts, but it is offered for older adults. In about 35 minutes, the male instructor (maybe in his 40s) and woman student demonstrator (maybe in her 80s) are easily followed in exercising and loosening all major muscles without strain. We are less stressed afterward, and sometime when doing challenging work outdoors, I do a few of the Tai Chi movements to get re-centered. A good buyer us.",1488585600,,550,4.401960784313726

4271375,5,B0046ZE3OE,"I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I love Scott Cole's DVD's.  I've tried Tai Chi DVD's by several different instructors, but I think Scott Cole's DVD's are the easiest and best to follow. I have several of his beginner Tai Chi DVD's and like them all, but I think his ""Discover Tai Chi for Fitness"" might be my favorite.  He does an excellent job (especially on this DVD) of demonstrating the moves so that they're easy to follow and learn. The routines are very slow, gentle, graceful movements that stretch the muscles, improve balance, and strength, and it doesn't hurt to do them!

I think every joint and muscle is used in these routines, and they really help for flexibility, balance, and strength.  I couldn't sit cross legged when I first started Tai Chi, but after 4 weeks I could!  And any muscle tightness in my back or pain that I have from sitting at the computer too long are ""cured"" after doing these DVD's!

The breathing and movements in these routines also leave one more relaxed, and calm.  Great stress reliever for anyone.  You have to concentrate on the breathing and movements, or you'll tend to tip over! By the time you're done with his routine, any stress, anger, or irritation you were having is gone!

I think Tai Chi can be used by almost everyone, including people who have limited motion or health issues.  So many people would benefit from doing Tai Chi.",1487894400,6,1392,4.57258064516129

The movements taught in this DVD helped me strengthen muscles to move and walk and balance.

4271599,5,B0046ZE3OE,"Really like this DVD with Scott Cole. I also purchased T'ia Chi for Health & Happiness with David-Dorian Ross and was not impressed nor learned as much about T'ia Chi from his DVD.  Scott Cole explains what he is doing as he is teaching T'ai Chi and I feel  I am getting the benefits of doing the actions of T'ia Chi.  I have not done T'ia Chi prior to this DVD and was curious as to the movements and what I would gain from practicing.  I am a 67 years young and have started having balancing issues and this really does help since you have to do the exercises with slow and meaningful actions and breathing.  Slow is the place I was not so sure about, but it does do a lot to enhance the balance issues.  I always thought and do exercises that use a bit more speed in them.  Maybe come back after I get better at it to make more comments.",1457827200,3,840,4.085365853658536

Scott is so easy to follow and I like the fact that he has a ""senior"" showing the results.  I also swim and take a class two days a week which involves movement, weights and stretch bands.

When you practice meditational practices like Tai Chi, Yoga, or Qi Gong try incorporating the Saam Meditation Technique into your procedure. This is a meditation based upon a 500 year old Korean Acupuncture Technique. Instead of only focusing on the chakras or third eye, Saam Meditation technique brings one's Qi and attention to acupuncture points on the hands and feet. In doing so we can specifically target each of the twelve primary organs like the heart, liver, lungs, stomach, kidneys, etc. Meditation upon the hands and feet strongly stimulates the brain and intensifies the sensation and healing effects of Qi across the whole body. Saam Medical Meditation has pictures of the four point acupuncture combinations for each of the organs. Each point of the meditation is easy to locate.

I wish this routine were a little longer since I could follow along with Scott all day. That said, this DVD would work very well in a rehabilitative setting or with the elderly. For the advanced beginner such as myself I prefer Scott Cole's Discover Tai Chi and AM/PM workout DVD's. Don't get me wrong...it's not ""bad"" (which is why I gave it four stars).

I find it lacking, though, because I expected it to be more physically challenging, like a workout (the name says fitness, after all). It's not challenging for me, my heart rate doesn't increase at all. I also wish that it focused more on learning a number of forms, and doing them correctly (i think he only goes through about 10 forms, and throws in a little yoga and chigung).

I have all sorts of aches and pains acquired anywhere from falling off my motorcycle and breaking bones, to falling while skiing and just falling hard on black ice.  My body has not forgotten these injuries and so I suffer daily with chronic pain.  Most exercise programs that I tried (and I have tried dozens of different ones), just don't seem the have the right amount of intensity nor keep me motivated  This is the only one that I am sticking too and doing 5 days a week, religiously.  I  am seeing noticeable results in my range of motion and decrease in pain.  I can actually walk up the stairs without groaning and taking one step at a time.  I love Scott's gentle and caring voice, and no he does not check in too much with his student.  She is an inspiration as is he.

My Doctor recommended  learning tai chi to help mobility and flexibility.  I checked out several dvd's from the library to see if I could do any of the routines.  Apart from the fact I could only keep the dvd's a week, I found I enjoyed the exercises, but none of the ""masters"" resonated with me.  I discovered Scott Cole on the 'net, and immediately felt that he was someone I could follow, so I went to Amazon with the hot little gift card I'd gotten for Christmas burning a hole in my wallet, and made the purchase I'd had my eye on for awhile.  I find the workouts easily do-able, and I get a kick out of his workout companion, who's got a few years on me at least! (I was determined...if SHE could do it, so could I! LOL!) I'm planning to get a few of his other dvds, as I get better at this one.  I just love that he understands the needs of those of us who have physical issues...he even has moves that can be done sitting in a chair, for those who have trouble being on their feet.

4272006,1,B0046ZE3OE,"This video is allegedly designed for older people. However, many of the exercises in it are unsafe for anyone with osteoporosis  which includes many many elderly people, particularly women.

When you have osteoporosis, the front of your vertebrae tend to break so that they become wedge-shaped in the front. This is what causes older people to develop spines that curve forward. Because the fronts of vertebrae are so vulnerable, informed physical therapists warn strongly against exercises, such as bending forward from the waist, that tend to compress (and break) the front vertebrae. See the National Osteoporosis (NOF) website on safe alignment, which states Some exercises can do more harm than good. If you have osteoporosis or have had broken bones in the spine, you should avoid exercises that involve bending over from the waist. [...]

This video is full of exercises bending forward from the waist. The elderly model in the video and Mr. Cole are strong and limber enough to maintain relatively flat backs while bending from the waist. Most elderly people (the overwhelming majority probably) will not able to maintain neutral spines when doing these exercises. When they bend forward, they will inadvertently round their backs and put crushing pressure on the front of their vertebrae. ADDITIONALLY, at least one of the exercises calls for you to hang forward and then roll up  which the NOF also warns is dangerous. Finally, the videos seated exercises are unsafe  again calling for people to bend forward and round their backs and to twist.

Please consult a resource on safe exercise for older people, particularly if you or your loved one has osteoporosis. Good resources are Sara Meeks book Walk Tall and the NOF website and the resources there. Tai Chi can be great for people with osteoporosis but it has to be done without forward compression and twisting.",1390176000,100,1876,5.074675324675325

This exercise DVD allowed me to gently move my muscles paying attention to my balance.  I did almost fall once, but that was due to the position I had my head in, not due to fatigue,  I appreciate that many of the chair exercises are currently mu physical therapy exercises.  And although I know that my form and breathing were not good this first time I found myself thinking - wow, I can't wait to do this again!  The instructor was slow, steady and encouraging and referred to the student quite often (who was doing just as well as he was btw).

Why I love this workout:

* Scott Cole is a wonderful instructor.  He is knowledgeable and very down to earth.  I love his funny comments too since they always make me smile.

* The faster pace of the Tai Chi; the pace is still relaxed but I can really feel the energy flowing through my body.  My other Tai Chi workouts move a lot more slowly.

* The repetitions of each move.  I love how Scott has us do a move several times.  I can really work on my form and feel the moves this way.

* The beautiful background.  Scott is working out on the grounds of a resort and also inside in some lovely rooms.

* The different practices of balance, strength, mobility, flexibility and stress reduction.  You can pick and choose which sections are best for you on any day.  I love all the sections so I tend to do all of the them at a time.

Since Scott moves fairly quickly through the moves, I recommend that you watch the DVD several times so that you can become familiar with the moves.  I am familiar with Tai Chi, so I didn't have a problem doing the moves the first time.

This workout is suitable for any level, from those completely new to exercise to athletes.  If you want a workout that will help you physically and mentally, you should try this one!",1386547200,34,1507,4.235915492957746

There was no way that I could possibly do any exercise program and I was afraid that I would make a fool of myself by taking any classes.  Tai Chi is so beautiful that I wanted to learn but realized that I would have to improve my muscle tone, balance and stamina first.  This program has (I believe) given me the possibility for a longer life than I would have had if I continued as before.

This is for people like me who want to get started. After just a few weeks I am much stronger, more graceful and much more secure in my balance. It's convenient. because there are two parts each 15 minutes long.  You can do one part then later the other part if you want by just using the menu.  I will be getting a more advanced (more actual) Tai Chi video soon.

I guarantee that they will love it and excel in it as well as the fact that it gives you more energy to deal with them.

4272243,4,B0046ZE3OE,"My mom is over 70 and relatively healthy.  As with many seniors though, the doctors always recommend she get in some daily exercise.  I noticed that my mom has been lagging a little bit.  She goes out of the house once a week to do some things but other days, she sometimes doesn't leave the house.  To combat this, I told my mom to exercise in the house.  We are fortunate to have a relative large garage that she can walk around a bit.  Additionally, a neighbor will occasionally call my mom to go out and walk.  To add to the routine, I looked for some basic exercises my mom might want to do.  I tried one of the ""Walk Away The Pounds"" DVD but my mom didn't like it.

She did say she wanted to learn Tai Chi, so when I saw this Scott Cole DVD, I purchased it right away.  I opened it tonight and had my mom go through the DVD as I observed.  The exercises were relatively easy and my mom didn't have a lot of trouble following along.

Overall, I think we have a winner here.  My mom is not exactly the best at learning new things.  THe fact that she could follow the DVD meant it was simple enough for her to use.  I see this as something my mom can do once or twice a week in addition to anything else she does.",1351900800,29,1216,4.008333333333334

There is nothing in Scott Cole's routine that is very daunting or difficult to do.  The routine stresses the strengthening of muscles used for balance and mobility.  Even though terminology is introduced, there is nothing in this routine which would scare people away who are not familiar with the art of Tai Chi.

For some reason I thought Tai Chi might be the answer so I spotted Scott Cole's DVD and ordered it.  Well it was the best thing I have done in a long time.  It is very easy to follow and it is fun to spend time with Scott and Claire almost every day.  Great way to get introduced to Tai Chi.  I also ordered Scott's DVD for back pain.  A little more detailed than the first one but I am getting it.  Tai Chi is very good and Scott and Claire make it fun.,1347840000,3,571,3.8290598290598292

4272262,5,B0046ZE3OE,"I bought this dvd several months ago and am surprised it isn't worn out.  If it should get damaged in any way, will replace it immediately.
Scott keeps the movements on the slow side and gives excellent verbal instructions making it very easy to follow.  I am 73 yrs old and feel my upper body has benefitted greatly from this dvd in the way of flexibility and strength; think it even helped with my golf swing.
  I have to confess that I have only been doing the standing portion of the dvd because it lasts about 15 minutes and can easily fit that in to my schedule almost every morning, whereas if I had to commit myself to a half hour for the complete exercise, would probably avoid it altogether.
  Seniors, in particular, should love this.",1342137600,8,745,4.4411764705882355

4272265,3,B0046ZE3OE,"Not dreadful but lacks instruction and energy.
The studio is a house and seems sort of odd to film in.
Scott has a nice voice and one can tell he has been instructing  along time.
He is easy to watch and the moves are all gentle and performed well.
He gives little to no instruction on how to do actually do the moves. That is actually fine with me as I am a practioner but others might be lost.
His pal, Claire is very fluid and clearly limber.
I imagine everyone is supposed to watch her and learn as Scott goes into his lovely talk about Tai Chi and the name of the movement which is pleasant enough.
But, it is really necessary to ""check in"" with Claire every 5 minutes?
He says her name constantly and keeps asking her how she is doing.
WHY? Is she going to fall down or something?
Clearly, Claire is fine and as she is on the DVD we assume she will make it all the way through.
Pros:  Nice music and easy to watch. Good for folks who need gentle moves and may not be able to do yoga. Worth the watch for these folks.
Cons: little to  no actual instruction, way too much Claire checking . We could have used less Clairing and more verbal instruction.
Not bad at all for seniors and beginners but seems really not useful for anyone wanting something deep and informative.

I was very impressed with this video.  The exercises were not too difficult and were very slow and gentle.  After the workout I felt very refreshed and energized.  The length of the workout is the perfect amount of time, just taking a little over 30 minutes to complete.

My mother also enjoys this video and uses it at least twice a week.  However, for someone that has not tried this type of exercise, she would recommend that you split the video into two 15 min workouts until you get use to it.

You still have to be able to perform moderate exercise. However, there is a brief segment showing movements and stretching from a sitting position. The length is just right for me: about 32 minutes. The background music is relaxing and appropriate to the slow, careful movements of Tai Chi. It is helpful that Scott Cole has an older lady doing the workout with him. She briefly relates her story after the main segment. She had heart trouble and could hardly walk before she started Tai Chi in Cole's class.",1330128000,385,645,4.872727272727273
