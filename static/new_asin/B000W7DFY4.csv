2963058,4,B000W7DFY4,"This is a 30 minute walk with menu options to choose 1 or 2 miles.  This DVD is very similar to the ""walk slim"" series (same set).  The walk features Leslies 4 basic moves (no boosts).  Leslie has a new group of walkers in this one.",1276646400,6,232,4.0
2963059,5,B000W7DFY4,I love this DVD for kicking you into the mode of exercising everyday.  The movements are normal and Leslie switches up the movement so well that I don't even notice the time going by.  It incorporates a 1-mile walk and some stretching and cardio and includes warm up and cool down.  Great for anyone who's been out of exercise mode for a long time.,1238025600,14,348,4.40625

8221472,4,B000W7DFY4,I was looking for the 2 mile version of this DVD. The material is good just not as good as the 2 mile version.,1474761600,,110,3.625
8221473,5,B000W7DFY4,"I bought this video from Kaiser Permanente 2 years ago when I was diagnosed as pre diabetic  it was called Walking Down Your Diabetes then. It was one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I also have Leslie's Walk Away the Pounds 3 DVD set, but this is my favorite.  Within 3 months my a1c was down to normal and I had lost 10 pounds.  I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone.  If you stick with it like I did it really works.  I love it and plan to order a backup soon just in case mine wears out.",1472774400,,506,3.911764705882353

8221476,1,B000W7DFY4,I have other DVD's from Leslie Sansome that are really good but not this one.  It's about as boring and fake as they come.  I should have returned it but it's already put it in my garage sale pile.,1427846400,,197,4.0256410256410255
