3963273,4,B002OVB9T4,"I always thought making a workout ""fun"" was how to stay motivated.  I own dance videos (I have a degree in dance), entertaining aerobics routines, etc.  None really excited me enough to put them in the DVD player.  Jay's no-nonsense approach, however, keeps me coming back for more.  I'm determined to nail all the star jumps without losing my technique (it's the one move in the cardio section where I am always tempted to cheat because they are exhausting!).  His sayings echo in my head all day too: ""Don't Major in Minor things,"" ""If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much space,"" etc.  But it's not an in-your-face military growl... it's a calm, focused, encouraging voice.

With other routines, if I missed a day I didn't feel bad exactly... disappointed in myself, yes, but I'd always shrug it off.  I actually look forward to waking up to get this one in before getting ready for work.  Occasionally I have to wait until the afternoon/evening (hey, there are days when the snooze button is just way too appealing), but I find myself coming on 2pm, anxious to get home so I can kick my own butt.

The gym bores me.  Other DVDs never keep me interested because I don't feel that motivation and drive to better myself.  With Jay, I'm in competition with myself.  He and Lin continually remind you to write down how many reps you did and I truly believe keeping a track record is the best way to stay focused.

I would like a more lengthy stretching section, but I can do that on my own.",1269907200,2,1509,4.5
3963274,4,B002OVB9T4,"This video will give you a great lower body, core, and cardio workout.  The addition of weights will give you an upper body workout as well.  I caution those with bad knees - this workout may not be for you; but the instructors do a good job of providing modifications for those excercises that may put more stress on the knees.",1266105600,4,328,4.360655737704918
3963275,5,B002OVB9T4,"The Jay Johnson Boot Camp Fitness DVD I ordered arrived yesterday and I was so excited to try it today. ""Boot Camp"" workouts are a pretty big deal here, but due to my work schedule, there's really no way for me to join a class and still have time to get ready for work.

I already liked what I had seen of Jay on DCC and figured I'd give this a try. Note: the DVD was $15 when I ordered it, and know it's down to $11.50, which is a hell of a deal.

I couldn't find a detailed review online, so I thought I'd just do one myself.

Things you need to know: Jay is chit-chatty, and military. And hard-core. And his wife is the hot blonde on the cover with him. She helps lead as well.

You really don't need any equipment for this, and although some of the demonstrators do use hand weights from time to time, those of us trying to get back in shape certainly don't need them to get a good workout. Jay does want you to download his guide and learn the moves before you begin, but I didn't do this and it wasn't that big of a deal. If you are fairly coordinated, you can pick it up.

The workout is divided into five sections, and there's a countdown bar at the bottom of the screen to let you know how much time is left in each section, which is GENIUS. Gave me something to look forward to.

First section: Prep. 4:45. Basically some warm up cardio-type moves. No stretching.

Second section: Abs. Around 12:00. I love that they did abs first. I always get worn out and since abs are at the end of most DVD workouts, I tend to turn off the DVD and skip that part. No chance of that here.

Third section: Legs. Around 14:00. Holy crap, this is rough. Jay does his exercises in ""cadences"". Like 1 2 3, 1, 1 2 3, 2, 1 2 3, 3, and he does five of them. Then he gives you 30 seconds to do as many of that move as you can. It's a little crazy up there on the screen with 4 people going at their own pace, but I just picked the super-ab-cut lady and followed her during the free-for-alls.

Fourth section: Cardio. Around 14:00. He does what he calls a ""pyramid workout"" and does the cadence thing again. With the first exercise, you do 20 of the cadences. 10 second break, and then you do 19 of the next exercise. 1o second break again and you do 18 and so on until you get to 10 and that's your last one.

Fifth section: Recovery. 4:00. Here he does stretches and chit chats some more.

I think Jay and I are going to be good friends. I really think this workout is going to shape me up. But it's not for the faint of heart- be ready to really work out.",1262736000,16,2545,4.029761904761905
3963276,5,B002OVB9T4,"I am fortunate enough to go to Jay Johnson's  boot camp several days a week in Dallas. I started almost 2 years ago. At the age of 48, I have probably tried every fitness routine or DVD on the planet. I can honestly say that Jay's workouts are the ONLY exercise that I have ever done with full results. Within the first few months of doing Jays boot camp workouts, I lost over 20 lbs and have kept it off the entire time. I have completely transformed my body and my metabolism. Plus I feel better and happier than ever.
Jay knows how to train you but most importantly, he knows how to get into your head and teach you to BELIEVE that no matter how old, how overweight, or how athletically challenged you are or think you are,  YOU CAN DO THIS. He practices what he teaches and is a living example that will inspire you and make you want to give it your all. He is energetic and fun so you will never be bored.  Jay is a blessing and gift to the world. Give yourself this gift to become a better you. Learn how to change your body and mind which will make you stronger than ever and carry over into your daily life. There are a lot of ""imitation"" boot camps out there so don't waste your time and money on those. JAY JOHNSON IS THE REAL DEAL.  Do Jay's workouts regularly, eat well balanced food and I promise you, the results WILL show up on your entire body. Happy boot camping everyone... HOORAH!!!!",1257206400,8,1402,4.220149253731344
3963277,5,B002OVB9T4,"Kickboxing, running, weight lifting, jazzercise, Body Pump, and even personal training - you name it, and I have tried it to get that great toned look that so many people strive for. Those things worked, but very slowly and didn't get me the exact results I wanted. I still had soft areas that I was self conscious about, and even with personal training, my body fat was 19%. I started Jay's Boot Camp this year and WOW! I got down to 9% body fat and looked great, not to mention that I also felt really great too! Jay knows what works and his workouts are intense and fun in a way that keeps you coming back for more. I highly recommend Jay's workouts for anyone seeking to get to that next level of fitness. Thanks Jay for shaping me up and changing my view in a positive way on exercise!",1256601600,3,790,4.273333333333333
3963278,5,B002OVB9T4,I've taken Jay's Boot Camp in Dallas - this workout is GREAT - and it doesnt matter if you are a beginner or a pro - they have exercises for every level! VERY MOTIVATIONAL! He makes you think you can do ANYTHING! LOVE IT,1256601600,3,220,4.0227272727272725
8376431,5,B002OVB9T4,"The pace of this workout is perfect. Some reviews speak of the slow pace, but with some DVD's out there the pace is way to fast on some. This does not allow for good form. This DVD allows for a good warm up and steadily increases as one moves through the exercises. I work out and have tried every fitness DVD out there. These are extremely effective and left me sore! I love the fact that abs are done first and the talking does not bother me at all. Good workout that leaves me refreshed and not exhausted like some out there. The single best way to get in great shape. Works every major muscle group and allows for increase in weight and intensity.",1457913600,,651,4.258064516129032
8376432,1,B002OVB9T4,Not enough exercises on the video. Very limited,1430438400,,47,5.0
8376433,5,B002OVB9T4,I do this workout faithfully everyday and I absolutely love it! The exercises aren't that difficult in my opinion and it's a great full body workout! Jay Johnson is very motivating as well! I wouldn't reccomend it to someone with really bad knees or a bad neck though because they do a lot of jumping and floor work. Other than that it's perfect!,1394668800,,346,4.507936507936508
8376434,4,B002OVB9T4,Good workout for me but a little too chatty in some places. Was surprised the ending was so draggy also.,1369353600,,104,4.25
8376435,4,B002OVB9T4,"Not the best fat burner but certainly a must program (volume 1) if you want to build strength and stamina. This program is perfect for me because I can do the warm up, either the ab or cardio work out, and the recovery program in about 20 minutes before getting ready for work in the mornings.",1337817600,,293,4.25
8376436,5,B002OVB9T4,"I tried this video for the first time yesterday and I was feeling it throughout the video. I would say I'm in pretty good shape, mostly a runner, but I felt it in my abs and legs. They don't give a preview of the upcoming exercise but most are pretty well known and you can easily get into those exercises without missing a beat. They do a little more talking than most workout dvds but it's during the 10 second rest periods so lucky for that. Overall, I recommend.",1319500800,,466,4.247191011235955
8376437,2,B002OVB9T4,The halting pace of this workout does not excite me.  The bigger issue is absolutely no checking in on your form I've found in other products.  Will not buy more of Jay's workouts.  Save your money.,1298851200,,198,4.444444444444445
8376438,3,B002OVB9T4,"I bought this as my schedule doesn't allow me to get to the gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays and I needed something quick but hard that I could do in the living room. I have about 45 minutes and wanted to feel like I accomplished something by the end of the workout. The warm up is just fair. I found myself fast forwarding through it to get to the actual workout. Then, as I got going, I found myself fast forwarding even more because during each break, he talked and talked and talked which was allowing me to cool down way too much and his incessant chatter was just plain annoying. The workout is ok. The first time I did it, I did feel sore the next day which given that I am a regular hard exerciser, I found to be a good thing and made me feel like I had accomplished something. The workout can be done in a relatively small space and you can kind of pick and choose what areas you want to work on. However, he does talk too much during the breaks and during each exercise session.

Overall it's an ok exercise video. Definiately not one of my favorites though.",1298246400,4,1065,4.195121951219512
8376439,5,B002OVB9T4,"My fiance and I are preparing for our wedding so we both want to get really fit!  This Boot Camp is the ticket to fitness success and it actually motivates you to not give up! I highly recommed it, especially to those that need a little kick in the butt!",1290038400,,254,4.08
8376440,5,B002OVB9T4,This is a GREAT DVD! It's simple and easy and I felt the results immediately! I would definately reccomend it!,1288656000,,110,4.55
