196418,5,1578071461,"I actually watched this series when it was on PBS a couple of years ago and it almost brought me to tears. It was incredibly sad to hear about the way that the slaves were treated.
This video would be a great learning experience for classes. I am thinking about using it as an visual aide for my speech on slavery in NY.",972777600,18,320,4.095238095238095
196419,5,1578071461,"Narrated by Academy Award nominee Angela Bassett, ""Africans in America"" is the first television/video documentary which works to chronicle the full history of slavery in America.  The documentary is an  incredibily ambitious effort that employs relevant scholarly data,  interviews with noted historians, lively story-telling, and vivid accounts  from slave descendants to detail, in four ninety-minute episodes, events  from when Black and White indentured servants worked side by side (the  colonial era) to the freedom from slavery that came at the end of the Civil  War.  ""Africans in America"" could not come at at a better time,  when issues of racial strife continue to have a stranglehold on this  nation.  By looking at our racial past, we may be able to understand our  racial present and future.  The first part of the documentary,  ""The Terrible Transformation,"" details the origins of slavery in  America.  It dispels misconceptions that slavery was a sudden, full-blown  institution.  Rather, it shows that during the early 17th century slavery  became institutionalized over many decades, law by law.  Part two,  ""Revolution,"" focuses on the popularity of slavery in both the  South and North, and on George Washington's role in legalizing slavery.  Again, little known facts are highlighted, such as the role slaves played  as combatants in the American Revolution.  Part three, ""Brotherly  Love,"" turns to the then capital of the nation, Philadelphia, to  recount how the government recommitted to slavery for Blacks while  promising Whites liberty. This part also explores how the White scientific  community worked to link the Black race with biological inferiority,  thereby justifying the enslavement of African Americans.  The final  part of the documentary, ""Judgment,"" covers antebellum and  post-antebellum years.  It reminds us of the constitutional amendment to  free the slaves.  More importantly, this final part challenges viewers to  consider if slavery was really an inevitable institution, and, based on  past behaviors, whether this country can ever gain racial harmony.  ""Africans in America"" is thorough-- it took 10 years and millions  of dollars to produce.  It was shot on location across 12 states and 3  continents.  It draws upon documents, scholars' insights, and a few  well-knows such as Gen. Colin Powell.  In all, it is a masterful educative  effort.  This is a journey that every American must make-- preferably  through more than one viewing-- so that salient events are understood and  so that we may begin to comprehend that the journey to racial reconcilation  is far from over.",922233600,128,2629,5.401985111662531

196426,4,1578071461,"PBS has yet to out-do this series, one of the best documentaries on the period of African-American history prior to 1865 that's ever been produced.

I will say, that the first two volumes are much stronger than the last two - hence why I knocked off one star.  The sections on colonial slavery and slavery's relation to the American Revolution are excellent.  The sections on early national and antebellum slavery have a little trouble creating a coherent narrative and seem rushed.",1403481600,,482,4.925925925925926

The British establish colonies in New England with white indentured servants who serve a limited term and are difficult to control.

196436,5,1578071461,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.
As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.
Africans in America
This DVD is a great educational documentary it gives you more insight into slavery both before and after the American Revolutionary War. There are a lot of DVD's that cover slavery around the time of the civil war. But, there is not much on early days when America was fighting for independence.
There were a couple of rebellions by salves seeking their freedom. And some slaves joined the British during the war.
Very good and detail information, I recommend buying this DVD strongly.",1296950400,2,759,4.891472868217054

It was like watching the story of us on tv when Bank of America spun their propaganda through the entire series.  Bank of Americas a bunch of crooks! I don't want to see this banking cartel when I'm trying to learn about the story involving my ancestors!

If you purchase the DVD, it should be commercial free for god sakes!",1292198400,13,505,4.527472527472527
196438,5,1578071461,"Wonderful absorbing documentary about how Africans began coming into America and were turned into slaves.  The history stops at the Civil War but provides a complete overview of the time period before the end of slavery.  Africans who initially came were pressed into indentured servitude but after word got out in Europe and England how badly indentured servants were treated (few barely lived to freedom in 7 years) and tobacco was discovered to grow well in Virginia soil, planters sought to procure slaves to do work which others would not do.  I am teaching American History in school and found this to be a very good documentary and included information I didn't even know about.  Hard to reconcile the idea of freedom and slavery in the same country but the truth is the truth and it is not pretty.",1270425600,,805,4.76978417266187
196439,4,1578071461,Fairness Journalism Especially (PBS) along with all the other networks who claim Obective Journalism To Produce and Expose Greater Information About Blacks Whom Fought and Fight as True Rebells Of The Bigotry Within This Country (The United States) and Around The World.

I have the cds and play them all the time for the mixture of African American folkloric music mixed with the special contribution both Bernice J Reagon and her daughter Toshi Reagon are making to African American music and the light they continue to shed on the importance of African American music to American culture.  Apparently, so much of our music was protest music and part of an ongoing statement of humanity despite our conditions as slaves and for many years post slavery.  So I just love the it.",1219449600,,853,5.753968253968254
196442,5,1578071461,"This is not at all a boring documentary. The amount of information that is carried in this magnificent PBS special is positively staggering. From 1791-1831 the fledgling United States flourish and reveled in it's new found liberty; but it chose to live with a glaring contradiction to it's own principles: that being the institution of slavery. The situation of blacks in America and the lead up to the Civil War is the express reason for this 90 minute explanation of why America held on to slavery. This production discusses the economic factors, the political factors and the religious and even medical factors that Americans proposed for keeping the institution. On the other hand, the growing unrest of slaves, the forming abolitionist movement and the rise of leaders in the black community are thoroughly discussed. Angela Bassett narrates and many noted historians comment throughout. No small wonder this documentary won the 1998 Peabody Award.
Great companion films would be AMAZING GRACE,THE MIDDLE PASSAGE,THE VOYAGE OF LA AMISTAD, SHADOW OF HATE and A RESPECTABLE TRADE.",1189036800,,1083,5.265895953757226
196443,4,1578071461,This is a great piece of history.  Didn't receive 5 stars because I think the history should have continued and not ended at the point it did.,1184198400,4,142,4.2592592592592595
196444,4,1578071461,"Reading the book of the same name prompted me to purchase this DVD and I was not disappointed.  It provided the same atmosphere, despair, anger, amazement, etc however I highly suggest you read the book first. As with all movies made from a book, you lose a little something because of the time constraints but this is a good way for the kids/teenagers to wet their American/Black history appetite.  It is also a good way for the family to view it together and to discuss it, after, each chapter and get immediate feedback.  One way or the other, you can't watch this movie and not be moved.  The movie is a must in your DVD collection.",1179014400,6,636,4.456896551724138
196445,5,1578071461,I love history to death also. Looking back and studying history can help you find out who you are and where the world is going due to history often repeats itself. This six hour dvd is packed with information about slavery and its history. The documentary goes so deep into detail that it will have unknown information for the most scholarly historian. Features like this are important for children of afrikan descent due to the fact it seems that the school system isn't teaching this aspect of history and making sure our youth understands the importance of the events that happened. This documentary is highly recommended for your collection.,1173312000,4,645,4.926605504587156
196446,5,1578071461,"This DVD is great. It talks and tells alot of stuff I didn't know nor had any idea. Like exactly how Haiti became... Haiti, Our presidents... how the north and south were different and how they were the same at one point... USA fighting for independence and at the same time, Africans in America fighting for independence as well... and it talks about Native Americans as well. This is very very helpful for those who are actually interested in American history.",1133654400,11,462,4.716049382716049
196447,3,1578071461,"I read the book based on this documentary and can honestly tell you there is no contest here, the book is far better. I could not help but notice as I watched this film how under developed it was, I mean if I had not read the book I would have been confused about the persons being mentioned in this film. The book made me feel for the slaves because of the details and extensiveness of the person's personality being mentioned. when the same character was mentioned in the film it did nothing or added anything to the film itself. I understand that it is impossible to put the whole content of a book into a documentary but a little more character development would have helped this piece a lot more.

  The historians really saved this documentary for me, it was their comments and insights that kept me interested and having Collen Powell comment was pretty cool too.

Another gripe I have about this film are the voices being used incorrectly, for instance I was listening to a man who sounded like a big black southern man quoting Thomas Jefferson as a portrait of Jefferson was displayed on the TV screen. Not very convincing.

Do not get me wrong this film was good, but it can not be compared to the caliber of a Ken Burns type documentary.

 Bottom line, it was good but could have been a lot better.

Most people really don't know the history of British/ American slavery.  It was a conscious decision to use the British legal system to change the status of Africans after the rate of white indentured servants coming from England fell drastically.
