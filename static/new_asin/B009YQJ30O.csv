5372807,1,B009YQJ30O,"I'm usually a fan of Leapfrog products and have other Scout & Friends DVDs, but this one is terrible.  I can't believe anyone would actually recommend this DVD.  The premise of the video is a gallery being filled with items that are opposites which Scout and his friends choose.  They're given part of a word and complete the word two or three times until they find the ""right"" word.  The problem is, a few of the options that are ""wrong"" could actually be correct, and several that are ""correct"" are just silly (which isn't condusive to a guessing game format).  For example, they're supposed to find something noisy to go in a gallery and are given the letters OAT.  They come up with the word COAT, then say ""no, no, no"" because a coat isn't noisy.  Then they come up with the option BOAT, but say ""no, no, no"" (much to my child's confusion apparently they've never heard of a motor boat or tug boat).  The ""correct"" answer was GOAT.  When it came time for the opposite item, the ""correct"" answer was a quiet pig?!?  Another example is that your child should make the assumption when guessing that a sail on a sailboat is smaller than a pail.  If your child enjoys the Leapfrog characters and just zones out while watching tv, then he/she might enjoy this DVD, but if your child actually enjoys engaging and participating in these programs, he won't get anything educational out of this one.",1359417600,39,1394,4.5582329317269075
5372808,5,B009YQJ30O,"My son is almost 4 and loves scout. He has all of the scout movies and this one is a new favorite! The songs are very catchy. I hope they release a CD of the scout songs, but at least they have a sing along feature on the DVD so we can skip to the songs if we want to. If you have the other scout movies (""Phonics Farm"" and ""Numberland"") this will be a great addition to the collection. If you have never seen scout my son and I highly recommend it! They are fun and educational!",1358899200,,479,3.8979591836734695

5372825,3,B009YQJ30O,"We are fans of Leapfrog!
We paid about $6 for this and I think it was worth it. This is not the best in the DVD series, but my kids did enjoy it.  They watched this twice and were engaged. However, my kids are young (2.5 and 1.5) and it will be a short while before they understand opposites.

I must agree with one of the reviewers it seems like there is a better way to explain the words they chose. The words should display on the screen.

Leapfrog usually knocks it out of the park. So I understand that its difficult to always be exceptional :-).

I am struggling with giving this a 4 or 3 because I like Leap Frog products so much and my kids are engaged with it.

5372833,5,B009YQJ30O,Our grandson's just turned two and three and have been learning from Leapfrog DVD's since they were a year old.  They love them and the videos are entertaining enough that they do not drive us crazy when they want to watch them every time they visit.,1393027200,,250,4.434782608695652
5372834,4,B009YQJ30O,"Another very good learning video from Leapfrog, which has Scout and his friends visiting a museum and help the man at the library find opposites to words. These Leapfrog videos are both very entertaining and fun to watch.",1390953600,,221,4.842105263157895
5372835,3,B009YQJ30O,My kids didn't enjoy this one as much as the others with Tad and Lilly. It does teach great things,1388102400,,98,3.95
5372836,2,B009YQJ30O,"I'm not usually very picky about learning videos. Leap Frog DVDs have all met my standards. 1. He enjoys watching them. 2. He learns something from them. 3. There is nothing that encourages being bratty/disobedient. AND... 4. I don't mind watching/hearing it over and over again.

This video meets 3 of 4 expectations. However, I have hidden it because of how horribly it has failed #4. I can't stand the ""yes, yes yes"" and ""no, no, no"". It's beyond annoying to hear when the video is playing and then my boy (3yrs) goes around the house saying ""no, no, no"" repeatedly at full volume.  This one gets a 10 on my most annoying toys list. It's not a bad show, but not worth the headache.",1387065600,,684,4.464
5372837,5,B009YQJ30O,My grandsons love the leap frog videos.  They ask to watch all the time.  They learn something  new everytime they watch it.  Great gift.,1382140800,2,137,4.583333333333333

5372859,4,B009YQJ30O,"Both of my girls (ages four and two) love Scout and Violet, so this was a nice addition to their little Scout and Violet video collection. They have both learned about opposite words with this DVD, my two-year-old especially loves to sing along with the songs.",1378771200,,260,4.673913043478261
5372860,4,B009YQJ30O,"I would recommend this product for all parent with young children.  As a parent and teacher, I see the value in finding quality, age appropriate video programs for young children.  This series has just that, it is fun and has educational value within it.",1378598400,,254,4.75
5372861,4,B009YQJ30O,It also talks about similar words. I just wish it would show the words not just say them. Perfect for ages 1-4 years.,1376611200,,117,4.130434782608695
5372862,5,B009YQJ30O,This video is excellent for all children ages 2-6 for basic phonemic awareness practice.  My child is 3 and sounding out words.,1376265600,,127,4.7727272727272725
5372863,4,B009YQJ30O,"I bought this for my two and half year old and she didn't appreciate it then. Now at three she simply loves it, sings along and learns so many new words in the process. The CD combines both the learning of opposites, introduction of synonyms and the spelling of words. I didn't expect the last two qualities so it was a really GOOD bonus! The new vocabulary introduction is wide and it's really interesting. It also presented more learning for older babies from the leapfrog stables.

I rated it a four star because I felt some of the opposites could be misleading...for instance there was a `slow hen' against a `fast bat', but there could be fast running hens. So I felt she would relate the word slow to hens which is not true, I would have preferred something like a snail, which is always slow. However all in all a really good buy!!",1372636800,,838,4.441558441558442
5372864,5,B009YQJ30O,"From the first time my kids watched this, they were hooked...in a good way of course. They watch it frequently, asking for it by name and have learned so much from it. Cant wait for more new videos.",1371513600,,198,4.2368421052631575
5372865,5,B009YQJ30O,The children loved the video and are singing the songs constantly.  They can recite the words and meanings in the video and are excited when I suggest watching it again.,1369267200,,169,4.633333333333334
5372866,2,B009YQJ30O,"I'm shocked that any five-star reviews exist for this DVD...but hey, I actually watched it myself.  Unlike most titles in the Leap Frog franchise (including ""Adventures in Shapeville Park"", another recent release), ""The Magnificent Museum of Opposite Words"" is confusing, forgettable and...oh yeah, not very educational.

The opposites on display in the museum aren't very intuitive and will most likely go right over the heads of the target audience.  The story feels rushed, and it really feels like many elements were an afterthought to the flimsy ""lesson"" provided here.  I'll admit, though, that the characters are cute and certain portions of this program might hold your child's attention.  Also, the songs themselves are kind of catchy, but that's hardly high praise when this title already has so many strikes against it.

Overall, I definitely wouldn't recommend this to any parents or kids, whether they're fans of Leap Frog or not.  Start with one of the other releases first.

On a related note, I've written a more in-depth review over at DVDtalk.com which you can find at that site (can't post a direct link, unfortunately).",1365552000,6,1139,5.1521739130434785
5372867,5,B009YQJ30O,Leapfrog products are terrific. My two kids love the movies and were excited to have a new dvd to watch.,1362614400,,104,4.25
5372868,5,B009YQJ30O,"Explaining to kids about similar words and opposites can be hard.  I know for my kids it is hard to explain that different words can mean the same thing and then explain how other words mean the complete opposite!  This is a great DVD because it goes over words over and over so kids are constantly hearing them and picking them up.  I honestly put this on the other day while we played in the toy room and even though my kids weren't watching this, they were hearing the words and looking over.  My 18 month old loves this DVD the most probably because of the fun and adorable animation!  It is a great DVD for any preschooler (or younger) and even my kindergartner wanted to watch it again!  The words are easy enough for kids but they are beneficial for kids to learn.

I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1360195200,,837,4.292993630573249
