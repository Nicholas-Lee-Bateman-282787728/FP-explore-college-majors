8139898,2,B000HIVIVU,"'Vapid' is a micro-budgeted serial killer film with a dash of cannibalism.  There is enough skill shown to produce a clear storyline and to generate a sense that with massive upgrades it could become a decent genre picture.  The cast looks nice, even if many are not skilled actors.  Be aware that the director, producer, writer, cinematographer, editor, and central character are one and the same person, Michael Haboush, who has done some interesting work in other films.

Digitz (Haboush), always shown in a distorted view, is a fat, unattractive construction worker who wants either to model or to photograph models.  When established photographer B'Jesus (an over-the-top Mark Studner) belittles Digitz's ambitions, Digitz has two henchmen kidnap B'Jesus and put him in a cage.

Digitz goes into the business of photographing models, with the idea of eliminating the undeserving, vapid models who have usurped Digitz's rightful place.  Using a bogus bracelet with an eye motif, Digitz hypnotizes the models and has them kill themselves.  The two solo male models are made to take their clothes off first.  The two henchmen wrap the bodies in what looks like construction paper and drag the bodies through the streets to put in the cage to feed B'Jesus.

Digitz comes into conflict with his boss, Beau (Paolo Carascon, Jr.), and meets up with a model, Kate Crash, who gets out in time.  B'Jesus escapes to transform himself improbably.  Do Digitz and the henchmen get their come-uppance?  Watch and see.

The models look nice and provide the most watchable segments.  It was a pleasure to have Arthur Huber ('Issues 101', 'K-Hole', 'Slice of Terror') return, this time as a TV newscaster.  'Vapid' has a tongue-in-cheek humor that comes through from time to time.  The film lasts about 83 minutes.  There are no extra features on the DVD.

There is no sex shown.  I don't recall any bad language.  The movie was filmed in West Hollywood, CA.  I suspect this was a group of friends who put out an exploitation film for the fun of it.  As such, it is a very good effort.",1233014400,,2072,4.890804597701149

8139900,3,B000HIVIVU,"just like all the rest of them.  there are a few """"pretty""""  parts.
but no enought to make a great film.
just invest a little more in the script and you will eventually make
a decent movie",1226361600,,188,4.054054054054054
