6223614,5,B00HUQCA4Q,"An important film.  Made with care and grace and great artistry.  And, perhaps most importantly, made with great restraint; though what happened to James Chasse was horrible, inexcusable, the filmmaker never lets any understandable anger lead or pull the story, and Lindstrom is always calm and even-handed in the presentation of the facts.  And the film is all the more powerful because of that.",1410220800,4,396,5.15625
6223615,4,B00HUQCA4Q,"It was very interesting.  I wish it could be played in school, perhaps a health class in the teen years.  People judge without any understanding.  This is eye opening to the plight of many with mental health issues.",1406332800,3,215,4.605263157894737
6223616,5,B00HUQCA4Q,"This DVD and it's story of a man who lived with a mental illness, and although for a time period doing very well had discontinued his meds and although peaceful enough, roamed about disheveled...was a man suffering through his life. The police who ended up murdering him...yes murdering him for ""possible"" public urination were not trained in dealing with a scared man with PTSD regarding an earlier even with police officers. He was terrified so he ran. Why the police had to chase him for this minor offense, after seeing the terrified look on his face is anybody's guess. These police officers, although are not a representation of all police but clearly had other issues going on does not change the way our loved ones are being treated.
I recommend purchasing this documentary and asking your neighborhood police dept. to get the training that many NAMI organizations have (The National Alliance on Mental Illness) to keep our loved ones safe. The nation has closed a lot of hospitals and now these citizens (yes citizens) are being abused on the streets, if not outright murdered for the very illness they are suffering for. Could you imagine if Cancer patients were treated like this, if they were harassed for loosing their hair, or being sick in public? Time for all of us to stand up! You know the ole saying...a country who treats the neediest... LET US MAKE THE DIFFERENCE!",1398124800,7,1385,4.823529411764706
6223617,5,B00HUQCA4Q,"This is the story of James Chasse, a young man with mental illness who was severely mistreated by police in Portland, Oregon. The film includes interviews with his family, friends, witnesses to the police brutality, and those who sought justice for James.",1397433600,6,255,5.095238095238095
8635975,5,B00HUQCA4Q,"Absolutely heartbreaking. This film touches on a very important subject that needs to be shared far and wide. Watch it and tell your friends to watch it. It's not just about police brutality. People need to think about why this happened, and the widespread lack of compassion and understanding that is a sickness in our society. Mental illness is real and it's terrible and those who can help should be helping, not hurting.",1531353600,,424,4.821917808219178
8635976,5,B00HUQCA4Q,Very disturbing. Very sad. Very true. Five stars.,1523404800,,49,5.25
8635977,3,B00HUQCA4Q,This was a gift. So not sure how they liked it.,1523404800,,47,3.3636363636363638
8635978,5,B00HUQCA4Q,This is a well-made documentary that should be watched by everyone. The painful story of James Chasse has never been more relevant than now. I highly reccommend it.,1521504000,,164,4.892857142857143
8635979,5,B00HUQCA4Q,This is a must-watch documentary about police overreaction when faced with those suffering from mental illness.,1520985600,,111,6.0
8635980,5,B00HUQCA4Q,"Outstanding work on this tragic story. I sobbed watching him sail in the jail out of pure pain, and continued to see moments that had me shocked, like the incredible sheer number of mistakes well documented & vital information not relayed by officers, from the entire altercation, listing him as transient when they knew he wasn't, to the story of what occurred immediately prior to the police takedown/assault, then lastly the promotions of officers involved. This was thoroughly told, the detail is abundant, it's heartbreaking but a crucially relevant story everybody should watch.",1520467200,,584,5.290322580645161
8635981,5,B00HUQCA4Q,A scathing indictment of absolutely brutal and out-of-control law enforcement thugs who were allowed to murder a mentally ill man for sport. Watching the politicians and lawmakers absolutely cave in to the police union will give you a stroke if you aren't careful. The lesson? If the police think you are urinating in public and they brace you - and you run - they are allowed to murder you. Enjoy.,1519776000,,398,4.7
8635982,5,B00HUQCA4Q,Great documentary and such a revelation to the plight of many people with mental illness when it comes to dealing with the police force. Frankly I was so disgusted by Humphrey's indifference and complete lack of remorse.,1519776000,,220,4.972972972972973
8635983,5,B00HUQCA4Q,"Eye-opening and infuriating.  I tried to be sympathetic toward the police who have a difficult job but the lengths that municipal and gvmt agencies go to to protect them shows how they must always be scrutinized, surveilled by citizens and held to account.",1518307200,,256,4.953488372093023
8635984,5,B00HUQCA4Q,"Well made and such an important issue. This film should be shown to not only schools, as suggested in another review, but to all public service employees such as police and fire departments, medical transporters, social workers, etc. There needs to be a better understanding and public awareness of every single issue dealt with in this film.",1516579200,3,342,5.017543859649122
