8165899,1,B0000A03KI,"Don't let the price fool you, this is a budget release! How it was listed at $14.95, I don't know! I bought mine directly from Amazon, and it had a price sticker on the cellophane wrapping  for $4.99, and the quality shows it! Eight of the cartoons are found on the first Rhino DVD, and with much better picture and sound. The other five are only here, but with even worse picture and sound! Worse yet, all of the wrap-arounds are found on the two Rhino DVD's! Skip this, and get the two Rhino releases titled ""Cartoon Classics vols. 1 and 2"". Each is about the same price as this rip-off, each is a remastered full-quality release, and there is a link to both of them right here on this product page!!",1136505600,10,702,4.318181818181818
