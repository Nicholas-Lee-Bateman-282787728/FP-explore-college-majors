3650667,2,B001J4E1D8,"Comparing this new adaptation with the two other versions in mind, the 2008 Tess of the D'Urbervilles adaptation is a failure. I felt the script was rather clumsily done on the whole. Although the film did not stray far from the book in plot, it did not portray the despair and bleak feel that was felt in the book by Thomas Hardy.
The actors were alright, although not on the whole perfectly cast. Gemma Arterton is an excellent Tess, better than Justine Waddell and a tie to the role with Nastassja Kinski in Polanski's adaptation produced in 1979.
Eddie Redmayne was a complete disaster in the role of Angel Clare, being too boyish and almost, one could say uninterested in the events taking place. He does not appear to be in love with Tess at all, but rather he appears to be an onlooker.
Hans Matheson needed more evil in his looks and a crueler appearance for Alec D'Urbervilles.
Anna Massey was an excellent Mrs. D'Urbervilles, although she did play just a minor role.
Compared to the other versions this adaptation was not as clean as one would wish, therefore it is a TV-14 rating.
My feelings on this film are rather of disappointment and that more could have been done as a whole, I frankly expected something better. If you want to view a better adaptation of this story see the Polanski's 1979 production.",1232496000,10,1319,4.617021276595745
3650668,5,B001J4E1D8,I highly Recommend this video. This video will stick in your mind long after you have watched Beautiful Tess go through the realities of life and reminding all of us that there is no heaven on this earth. Only the dammed prosper here for a very short time. This is a great video for those who still believe in love and living a innocent godly life through all of lifes difficult trials.,1232150400,2,386,4.375
3650669,5,B001J4E1D8,"I've never read the book before, and this was my first time watching a film adaptation of this story.  Its funny because I accidentally started watching it, but within a few minutes I found myself captivated by this movie.  By the end of the first two hours I found myself hating Alec for what he did to Tess.  However, near the end I almost started liking him, which really surprised me.  Even though he was a bad person his character was a tortured soul.  He cared for Tess as much as he could care for anyone.  He even tried to make things right by marrying her.  I actually felt sorry for him as she kept rejecting him.  I knew that he had never changed, but I felt that he really did care for her.  Perhaps it was more so lust than true love that he had for her.  I also felt sorry for Tess.  I felt sorry for both of them if that is possible.  I didn't quite understand the whole mistress thing though.  I came to the conclusion that he wanted to marry her, but he couldn't because she was legally still married to Angel.  She was his only lover though, so in theory they were married, but just not legally.  Perhaps Alec didn't deserve death either.  He told her that her husband wouldn't come back, but even Tess thought he wouldn't come back.  I didn't think he was coming back either.  I understand that she was exacting revenge upon the man who had essentially ruined her life.  However, she also played a part in her own destruction.  I felt her biggest downfall was telling Angel about her past.  I suppose that was part of her characteristic purity.  Angel was not as effective of a character as Tess, or Alec.  I didn't hate him, or like him much.  He was a wet mop of a character.  His weakness was interesting though because it almost made it seem that Alec was more in love with Tess, or at least more passionate.  Fate played a large part in everything else that happened to Tess.  It seemed as though the murder of Alec was her way of finally taking fate into her own hands.  Anyway, this movie had me crying for quite a while.  The ending where she recreates the May Dance scene was also tragic.  The only way for her to have had a happy ending would have been if Angel had fallen in love with her before she fell from grace.  I took peace in the fact that at least she was set free in the end.  In any case, this is a haunting story that lingers in the mind.",1231718400,35,2380,4.22
3650670,3,B001J4E1D8,While watching the first disc I was intrigued and hooked into watching the second but half way through # 2 I thought it would never end. The ending was no surprise but the material was just too heavy for me. I didn't like any of the main characters.,1231718400,2,249,4.208333333333333
3650671,4,B001J4E1D8,"""Tess of the d'Urbervilles"" is one of my favorite books, and Tess is I dare say my favorite literary character. I loved the 1998 adaptation of ""Tess"" as soon as I saw it, and I was really excited to see if this newer, longer, (hopefully) fresher adaptation could possibly improve on an already beautiful version.  At the same time, I was preparing myself to try not to dislike it.  Happily, I can say: though it's still not a definitive adaptation, this version definitely holds its own.

Things ""Tess '08"" got right:

1. A great Tess
Gemma Arterton makes this character her own.  While Justine Waddell's Tess was delicate and sensual, Arterton plays Tess with more bite.  Both are valid interpretations of the character.  Both, however, also excel at the highly emotional scenes.  Tess is a sympathetic and brilliant character and Arterton definitely does the role justice

2. Very strong supporting cast
Though I still like the supporting cast of the '98 version more, I loved this version's portrayal of Tess's friends Marion and Izz. Tess's family members were also well chosen, and everyone at Talbothy's diary was great!  Hans Matheson's portrayal of the morally ambiguous Alec d'Urberville is particularly noteworthy.

3. An extremely strong last half
While it has its rough spots, the whole movie is worth it for the last hour.  It's an emotional rollercoaster.  I challenge you not to get an ache in your heart.

A few things that did not please me:

1. A disappointing Angel Clare
Eddie Redmayne just did not do it for me.  I was never convinced by Tess and Angel's romance, and the actor who played him was just...dull, and seemed slightly dim-witted.

2. Extremely changed scenes and awkwardly filmed scenes
Hello, ""it's too late"" scene, anyone?  It was almost unrecognizable.
Sometimes, throughout the movie, the dialog got a little strange, or the pacing seemed a little off. Either too abrupt, or too drawn out.

Some final words:

This 2008 version had many good things going for it, particularly Gemma Arterton as Tess, and it had some great scenes in there, most notably the mausoleum scene and Stongehenge scene.  But a weak Angel (Waddell and Milburne were sizzling together) and some awkwardly filmed scenes prevented this from being a terrific adaptation.  Basically, the last episode redeemed the entire series; I can't gush enough over how good it was. BUT, overall, this was a weaker adaptation compared to the '98 (my personal opinion of course!) because of the pacing issues, added/changed lines, and imperfect casting choices.  The fourth episode was by far the strongest, with Part 1 and Part 3 following.

I really enjoyed watching this mini-series, though, and I appreciate the effort to stick to the story and stay true to the characters. Now, if only one of the adaptations would include the pheasant scene!",1231718400,37,2840,4.968220338983051
3650672,5,B001J4E1D8,"Gemma Arterton is fantastic, if not perfect, as Tess in this new TV Film version of Tess of the d'Urbervilles.

As a male viewer (Yes, I was sucked into this film as I started to watch it with my wife) I certainly gained a greater appreciation for women. I cringed at just how awful men have treated women throughout history. I can't decide who I hated most, Alec or Angel. I think they both provide examples of how NOT to treat the women in your life.

Although in many ways it's extremely depressing, I still highly recommend this film. It contains a lot of important messages about forgiveness, tolerance, and love. It was also great to see the up-and-coming actress Gemma Arterton's wonderful performance.",1231718400,6,709,4.709677419354839

3650674,5,B001J4E1D8,"An outstanding performance by Tess and Alec, gorgeous scenery and costumes, stunning BBC classic.  Loved it!  Already have it pre-ordered for the release date.  Alec- Hans Matheson- fabulous evil & tortured soul has been seen in some of his other works (The Virgin Queen & Mists of Avalon), I think he truly soars in this production.  Tess is wonder, sweet and tragic, proud and practical all in one.  Gemma really captures this.  I did not like Angel, there was just too little chemistry, and often thought, why was this actor cast in this role?.  Either way, this DVD is well worth every minute.  Excellent production!",1231632000,11,620,4.838095238095238
3650675,4,B001J4E1D8,"That haunting song has been stuck in my head ever since I saw this four-part BBC miniseries. It was a stroke of genius to incorporate this folk tune into the soundtrack (composed by Rob Lane), which sums up the mood and aura of this tragic tale of a young woman wronged so unjustly by two men. Gemma Arterton is wonderful as Tess Durbeyfield, probably Thomas Hardy's most well-loved heroine, exploited by her ignorant parents into claiming noble heritage and discarded by 19th century society. Hans Matheson is Alec Stoke-d'Urberville, the wealthy cad who violates her, unknowingly impregnates her with a child who doesn't survive babyhood and later comes back into her life as a supposedly reformed preacher. Eddie Redmayne is Angel Clare, the seemingly kind-hearted and tolerant parson's son who wins Tess's love but proves to be just as hypocritical as his religious family and his actions bring Tess to despair. As in most Hardy tales, tragedy looms a large shadow over the lives of his characters.

Arterton's Tess is matched perfectly by Matheson's Alec, who is given more depth than any of the earlier film adaptations. The dark and tormented essence gives you the sense how doomed these two characters really are - their actions and words toward each other leads to their downfall. Unfortunately, the same cannot be applied to Redmayne's Angel, who looks befuddled and lost more than half the time. There is a rushed directorial pace in the second installment that hurts the romantic appeal between Tess and Angel, and the love story element seems a bit forced as a result. Because of that, I didn't get the appeal of Angel in this one, or why Tess and her fellow dairymaids were in love with him, or why Tess takes the desperate course of action in order to get him back. Some of the modern dialogue used did take away from the affect of the story, and Redmayne seemed to have a hard time keeping up with Arterton performance-wise. Redmayne redeemed himself somewhat in the final episode but for the most part I was unimpressed with him. However, director David Blair must take some of the criticism, as the hurried scenes to establish the ""romance"" seemed to skim over the parts of the novel that gave the lovers the attachment to one another that eventually leads Angel to see the error of his ways and beg his wife's forgiveness. I was anticipating Alec's return so much that I found myself not really caring if Angel came back for Tess or not. In sharp contrast, the 1998 A&E/London Weekend Television production had me rooting for Tess and Angel's reunion even though I was aware of the outcome. I was so taken by Angel in that one, whereas here I found nothing in him to be slightly attractive or romantic. I sympathized with Tess completely and neither man deserved her, but at least in the other version and the novel I could see why she loved Angel and longed for him to return to her. I found myself almost rooting for Alec (I never thought I'd say that), because Matheson was so compelling and magnetic and he and Arterton generated such electricity, I couldn't take my eyes off them. Alec's fleeting conversion to Christianity and his sermon in the tent that Tess stumbles upon is foreshadowing of the path these two ill-fated characters will end up on. The moment he lays eyes on her again, his fatal attraction and twisted love for her resurfaces and consumes him, and Tess finds herself increasingly helpless to refuse his help after her father dies and her family is left destitute. Alec's wealth is the only way he can possess her and he is aware of that, but he is willing to get her the only way he can, only to discover that fate does indeed play a vengeful hand. It was also nice to see Tess revisiting her child's grave and placing fresh flowers upon it; her deeply felt sense of loss and rejection by both the church and her village is searingly devastating because it becomes all the more clear that she is victim of both society (in which women had few advantages) and fate. Having said that, Tess and Angel's reunion did not have the emotional impact it should have had, the sex scene was unnecessary, but the Stonehedge sequence was an emotional powerhouse for Arterton, as was the climax of her walking off to her fate with her signature tune heard wistfully in the background. The supporting cast was in top form, and while the cinematography was lovely, it could have emphasized far more considering how important landscape is in Hardy's work, as both the 1998 two part program and Roman Polanski's 1979 film have demonstrated. As a four-part miniseries, it had the opportunity to include more scenes from the novel and insight into character, particularly Angel, which would have helped the plot a great deal. However, it was good to see the mausoleum scene and the ending was heartbreaking and moving, although my tears were for Tess, her sister Liza-Lu, and, dare I say it, even Alec, but I felt nothing for Angel (although Redmayne's tearful breakdown was by far his best moment).

On the whole, this was a very good presentation, my second favorite version and very much worth seeing. Arterton and Matheson give tour-de-force portrayals; it would be great if they would co-star again, some have suggested as Cathy and Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Heights"" - I could definitely see that. And that song will linger on in your memory long after the final credits have rolled, as will the rest of the score.",1230940800,81,5443,4.7405063291139244

I'd read the book a few years ago but had forgotten much of ending. This visual interpretation of the book is unforgettable. I am happy to add this to my British ""imports"" collection of films. The plot centers around Tess, from a poor family, in a time when women had little options other then marrying rich men, to be comfortable and have a respected status. She's pushed into circumstances that spiral from one hellish event down into another, with happiness never really within her grasp, unless she keeps a dark secret. But being dishonest is not in her nature, & she loses when the illusion one man has of her is shattered when she confesses a reality, within the world of double-standards, that still exists even today. The manipulation of her mother, the ineptness of her father and the cruelty of three men and unforgiving society, shapes her life into a result from which she cannot escape,  & finally she succumbs to the consequences of  her actions. The never-ending powerlessness and pain in her life causes her to take drastic action to gain control, but destroys her future. There is little comfort in knowing that her family will be taken care of, for her ultimate sacrifice.",1458864000,2,1336,4.705128205128205

3650711,3,B001J4E1D8,"I read the book and then watched this version and the 1998 version, all within the span of a couple months, so it is all quite fresh in my mind. My immediate response is that I did not like this version of the movie nearly as well as the 1998 version. The filming quality is rather better, because 10 years newer, and there are subtitles on the DVD, which are advantages. Also this version is an hour longer, so there are a few additional scenes that the other one didn't have. But even for all that, I feel that it's an inferior production.

I think hands down the cast in the 1998 version was better, EXCEPT for Alec D'Urberville, who seems closer to what I pictured him as in the book. The 2008 Tess's voice and mannerisms actually got on my nerves. Her look, voice, movements, and acting style all reminded me extremely of Jennifer Garner; she could easily pass for her little sister. Now, I think Jennifer Garner is great in a romantic comedy, but I would never cast her in a time-period drama. That style just does not work in a piece like this. I thought at first that maybe they were having the actress act very immature and use a babyish voice on purpose early in the film, so that it could alter as she grew up, but even after everything Tess goes through and all the growing up she does, the actress comes off extremely juvenile. I just had trouble taking her seriously. The 1998 Tess is way more convincing in the role. The 2008 Angel, I had read previously several complaints about his acting being rather flat, and I pretty much have to agree (though I had hoped to find him otherwise). He also has the problem of coming across simply too young. The actor was in fact the same age as Angel is said to be (26), but he looks very young for his age and again it is difficult to take him seriously. Granted that people got married young, but these two actors look too much like highschoolers with a crush on each other, rather than a convincing romance.

Even though there was more material, and therefore a few more scenes, there were more inaccuracies (altering the material rather than simply cutting it) in what it had than in the 1998 version. In general I'd say it followed the book quite closely, considering, but not as closely as the other one. There were several times I just cringed with ""But that's not how it happened..."" A few things they did treat more accurately, like the last few minutes of the movie.

I'm a big fan of soundtracks on time period films, so I think this is important to a good movie. This soundtrack was very prettily recorded, and I think on its own might make good music, but I frequently felt like the music did not really match up with the scene very well, which can be more distracting than cheaply budgeted music. The 1998 music is less impressive in quality, in my opinion, but worked better for the most part. The costumes and the scenery are beautiful, however.

Also, as a warning, there are 2 rather vivid sex scenes in this film. This and some of the subject matter may make this movie inappropriate for young children.

I came away from the 1998 version liking the book/story better than I had; and I came away from the 2008 version liking it less. This version simply did not carry as much power with it, and I never felt myself feeling for the characters as much as I did in the other one. Still, if you're into this genre or like comparing different versions (as I do), I wouldn't say not to watch it. But I don't recommend this being your only exposure to this intriguing and intense story. It's one that I had mixed feelings about as I read it, but has rather grown on me as it has sunk in more. And perhaps this version will grow on me as well, as I get more used to it.",1439251200,,3733,4.357758620689655

The acting was very good, it was what I've come to expect from a good BBC production. I just can't get past how terribly depressing the story was. The story, in my mind, negates the excellent performances. Definitely NOT a family show, nor is it for emotional tweens and teens.

3650737,4,B001J4E1D8,"I haven't read the book, nor am I now likely to, so I could not say if this is adaptation is worthy in terms of faithfulness to the original work.  What I can say is that for fans of period films based on literature this is pretty good, especially in that it is from the last few years, seemed to have a decent budget, and features some actors who have gone on to receive growing recognition.  It was absorbing, and my wife and I watched it all in one go.  All the essential ingredients were there - beautiful scenery, pretty language, insurmountable obstacles, unfathomable personal and cultural motivations, and the portrait held up to the Dorian Grey of society.  At the same time, just as the book Tess of the DUrbervilles is a less well-known classic outside of English major circles, this mini-series is almost certainly doomed to the same fate.

But what most struck me most about it was (and this may have been more due to liberties taken by the movie, for all I know) that though it was published only one lifetime after Austen (1891 vs. 1811) and describes much of the same world as she, themes that Austen, the Brontes, and others took on with a scalpel, Thomas Hardy takes on with cannon balls: double standards between men and women, rank hypocrisy in the church, the upside down viewpoint of popular opinion that persecute the good and exalt the evil, et cetera.  By comparing the degree of overtness in the social commentary you can sort of watch cultural change take place in history.",1419897600,,1500,4.599250936329588

Gemma Arterton is superb as the lead role and all major and minor characters play their part with dedication and are a joy to watch.
Based on the Thomas Hardy Novel, Tess of the d'Urbervilles follows the life of young, beautiful, innocent Tess and the misfortune she faces.

Purity was only required of the woman. I recall feeling terribly sorry for the rich man she lived with in the book. The movie builds no empathy for the rich man whatsoever.

She is a twin to the Tess who appeared in my imagination when I first read this book forty years ago. The cinematography is outstanding as it takes me back to the countryside before either Gemma or I walked it. Tess is a vessel of complete goodness filled with the wrongs of others. We marvel at how such an inherently good soul can bear the weight of those who misuse her time and time again.

Tess is portrayed as a woman of great character and moral fortitude which was the only thing that made this acceptable. The dark events she faced left me feeling drained by the end of episode 1.

I didn't find Arterton a very sympathetic and realistic Tess in the beginning but as the series progressed, she seemed more relateable.  Eddie Redmayne was excellent as her pathetic beloved.  The story is a little heavy handed in portraying the women victims of the times but the intractable grip of poverty and the Dickensian smug hard heartedness of the more fortunate was well done.",1407715200,,456,4.973684210526316

3650872,4,B001J4E1D8,"I watched all 4 episodes in one sitting.  I liked the fact that the show was true to form as it was lived during that period; raw living, you earned your keep, if you were born poor you pretty much stayed and married poor, or if you had a bit of money you were better off than the person who was dirt poor.  Sad, but true.  Since I hadn't heard of Tess of D'urbervilles, I didn't know what to expect but a love story was a surprise.  Pride has an uncanny ability to change the course of a person's life from joyful, to miserable and servitude, and lastly murder, as in the case of Tess, or were her decisions/actions based on love?  I'm not sure if yellow fever was the turning point in Angel's ""just as miserable life"" in Brasil, because while he's deathly sick he suddenly has an ephiphany about his gross mistake and mistreatment of Tess and he's coming back to her to be the husband he should've been.  Too late, mate!  At this point, Tess is a straight up mess and Angel's re-entry into her messed up life only worsens her decisions because she commits murder.  As Angel said to Tess, ""do you have a sense of what's right and wrong?""  Timing isn't everything and neither Tess or Angel are good at it.",1407456000,,1205,4.29646017699115

3650875,2,B001J4E1D8,"First off, if you are thinking of watching this film because you just love Gemma Arterton and Eddie Redmayne let me save you the trouble and stop you now. DO NOT watch this movie because of your love for them. Go back and rewatch The Pillars of the Earth or Lost in Austen or almost ANYTHING else these actors are in. You will enjoy rewatching whatever make you fall in love with them a whole lot more than anything that happens in this DepressFest of a film.

Now, the story of Tess, of which I am not familiar, is just as depressing if not more than Wuthering Heights. While the Bronte sisters have a nack for writing depressing loves stories, usually in the end you feel like watching it make you glad you are single or happy you found the one. I have never felt like something was stolen from me just because I watched a series. Please, for your own mental health, avoid actually watching this. The performances are quite good and there is one spark of hope for a short while before an unstoppable sadness sucks the life out of it. Believe me, you do not want to take this emotional ride, cause it's more like a mild crash that leaves the car disabled but so far away from help that the minor injuries sustained by the driver and passenger became life threatening by the time they reach help. Just stay away, okay? Go watch Prince of Persia again.",1407110400,2,1351,4.382470119521912

3650922,4,B001J4E1D8,". . . so don't be surprised when you see what Hardy in all his books concludes about the relationship between fate and God on one side and human nature on the other.  Coincidences hardly ever favor the good guys, and the almost obstinate, numbed, paralyzed failure to communicate by nearly all the characters whenever they have a chance to save a situation, those factors conspire to bring them over and over to the brink of destruction.  Tess and Angel walk along the brink, but don't walk side by side till the last quarter of the production.  But speaking of the production, WOW!  Actors are GREAT here, good guys being complex, bad guys turning inward and seeing their errors or their evil ways, and pitiful ones having a smidgen of humor, or a little madness to render even them interesting.  And all played to perfection, from Tess's mother's almost-endearing failures as she becomes less balanced to Tess's long physical wearing down and emotional degradation as she waits so, so long for Angel to finally forgive her for her long-ago error that had so devastated him when she finally told him.  If you just love wonderful English countryside landscapes with small human figures moving across -- Hardy's World is much larger than the tiny humans struggling through their hardships -- then that alone is worth the viewing!",1403395200,3,1328,4.853982300884955

I can never get those 4 hours back. In Fact, I am going to save some poor souls time with a synopsis... READY

Tess is a beautiful young peasant girl whose family finds out they are of noble lineage. When her drunken, lazy father can no longer work and the family horse is killed she is sent to prevail upon her rich relations. She travels to their manor seeking work and meets the son. A rake who finds her beautiful and decides (unbeknownst to her) that he must have her. When she returns home he sends for her to come and be manager of their chicken coupe. He shows her ""kindness"" only to one day trick her into a situation where they are alone in the woods and he rapes her. She immediately leaves to return home and stands up for herself against her rapist. As a result of her virtue being stolen she has become pregnant, births the child named ""Sorrow"" and the child becomes mortally ill. Her father ashamed of her having become pregnant will not allow the priest to come baptize the child and when the child dies she is told he cannot have a christian burial with no baptism (no wonder people became atheists back then). She is forced to bury her own child in a paupers grave. Overcome with grief she leaves her family home where she gets work as a milkmaid with people whom she comes to love. Amongst them the son of a noble clergyman who happens to work on the farm because that is what he wants to do with his life. He, of course, falls in love with the beautiful and virtuous Tess and asks her to marry him. At first she refuses because she has a secret past that is ""shameful"". He pursues and tells her no matter he past he will love her forever and must marry her. She finally accepts. Her conscience heavy she tries several times to tell him the full truth, even writes him a letter that gets lost under a mat and he never sees. Just before marrying she finds the letter and realizes he never read it and struggles with whether to tell him. She doesn't tell him. They marry. On their honeymoon before they consummate he confesses he had a fling once that lasted 48 hours and he is ashamed of is his loss of virtue. She feels confident she can now tell him her secret. She does. He rejects her (he's allowed to willingly have sex but because she was raped and bore another mans child she is a greater sinner???) He leaves her with some money and departs to Brazil. She gives the money to her parents to live and puts herself in the employ of a wretched farmer. She writes to her husband often with no response. She gets word that her father is dying. Returns home. He dies. Her family is now out on the streets. As they travel to find new lodgings she happens upon a traveling preachers tent. The preacher is her rapist who found God when his mother died. Seeing her stirs up his old feelings and he decides to abandon his new found spirituality in a relentless pursuit of the virtuous Tess. He is obsessed. He sees the destitution of her family and tells her selfish mother that he will care for all their needs if Tess will become his. She is forced into his arms. Her husband returns from Brazil (it's been a couple years) having survived yellow fever. He searches high and low for his love. Finds her. She belongs to another. She is crushed tells him to leave its too late. She returns to her rapists room and he starts a fight with her. She stabs and kills him. She runs after her true love. They run from the law. They finally consummate their marriage. Continue to try to flee the country. The police catch up with them she is arrested and executed. The End. GAHHHHH!!!!

The writer must have had a mental problem to have had such a dark outlook on the world. Of course our world is full of negitive happenings but we need to try to focus at least on some of the positive to keep hope alive. It seems the writer enjoyed never giving you what you want. On the other hand I guess it's a true part of our reality many people never get what they hope for most.",1395878400,,550,3.963963963963964

I don't remember smiling even once when reading the novel, but there are some lighter moments in the film.  All of the pathos, however, is fully developed in the film.  If you've never read Hardy, this might be a good introduction.  If the melancholy does not depress you too much, you might try reading the novel.",1395187200,,452,4.333333333333333

I thoroughly enjoyed watching this classic but the reason for the 4 stars is that half way through one of the 4 parts, the streaming stopped and I had to go back in and redo it in order to finish the section.
It amazed me the stigma that the unwed mother suffered due to her rape. I was further amazed by her husband's reaction to finding out that she had intercourse, albeit a rape, and not told him before committing him to marriage, so he abandons her. The person that he swore to be in love with was left to fend for herself while he sailed off to South America. They did get back together, for a few brief days before the law caught up with her for killing her rapist.",1394582400,,828,4.085889570552148

3651014,5,B001J4E1D8,"If you have read the book, and enjoyed it (well, as much as one can enjoy Thomas Hardy, since his novels tend to be a little melancholy) then you will not be disappointed with this adaptation. This is one of the best renderings of the book I have seen with Gemma Arterton portraying the poor, tragic heroine beautifully. Hans Matheson's turn as Alex D'urberville is wicked and compelling at the same time and Eddie Redmayne (Birdsong, Les Miserables) is completely convincing as the idealist Angel Clare. I felt the tone of the movie captured the book perfectly and drove home the themes that Hardy conveyed in the novel. Happy? No. Feel-good movie?Again, no, but one that explores the human heart in a very real and honest way. Tess is one of my all-time favorite novels though it has few happy moments, which may be why I cheer her on when she has her few, and this series gets it right.",1393891200,,889,4.5625

Life already is discouraging, why watch something that just adds to the sense of injustices in the world.  Some people like this morose kind of drama - and I do too, IF it there is something good that comes out of it.  And this movie does not portray that.  Also, for Tess to suggest that the love of her life marry her younger sister if she were to die or be taken away?

3651067,2,B001J4E1D8,"Someone compared it to Austen -- not at all!

This is one of the saddest and most depressing movies I have ever seen.  Cruelty, pettiness, and despair win the day. Perhaps this accenctuates the injustices that prevail throughout and makes a point that in 1891 (when the novel was published) needed to be made.  But the situations depicted by the story have been pressed home time and again since then.

There are redeeming qualities -- Gemma Arterton is captivating as Tess and this is accentuated set against many one-dimensional characters. Some of the acting was quite good, and the scenery and settings were well done.

The four star rating shows that many people enjoy this type of film, but if you do not like movies that leave you with a sense of waste, you will not enjoy this. Even the good parts did not make this worthwhile.  I must learn not to see something miserable through to the end just for a sense of closure.",1388880000,3,928,4.593939393939394

In this story the victim is Tess, and her naivete was abused by one man who changed her life forever. Her life full of misery came as a result of this one action perpetrated against her which followed her the rest of her life. Living in such times as a woman was not easy. She bore the guilt and shame. The second man betrayed her as well and when he came to his senses it was too late. Their happiness only lasted a moment. I blame the men and I did become disgusted with them. Poor Tess. But it is only a movie (and a novel). Thank God we don't live in those times. Thanks Thomas Hardy!",1385510400,,739,4.068493150684931

The movie could have worked but they seemed to pack in so much depressing drama in such a short amount of time, it made it painful to watch. The pacing of the movie was a bit awkward. Her downfall was her unrealistic outlook on life and her ""head in the clouds"" worldview. It was as if she was destined to a horrible lot in life and no matter how much she tried, life never turned out. BTW, they really should have aged her younger siblings correctly.

3651102,5,B001J4E1D8,"Thomas Hardy's book is one of my favorite novels and I loved Polanski's 1979 ""Tess"" so approached this adaptation with some skepticism. I have not seen the 1998 British version. I was intrigued before viewing with the information that one of my favorite actors Eddie Redmayne plays Angel Clare. But I am thoroughly entranced with the production so far. The production captures the contrasting beauty and harshness of the natural scene and how modern man was disconnecting from the mutually beneficial relationship with the land. Hardy's romanticism of living a simpler life connected to all Nature shines through in Tess. So far it is very true to Hardy's work without the extremes of the earlier production. Granted nothing can equal the sensuousness of the scene of Tess (Natassja Kinski) eating strawberries from Alec D'Urberville but the lushly sensual style may be over the top, making the sensual outweigh other aspects of the film. For anyone not vintage enough to have memories of Polanski's film linked to Tess, this production is an excellent viewing experience and, so far, portrayal of Hardy's ideas. Reviews always say that Tess is headstrong but I felt this is closer to Hardy's portrayal of a woman awakening to unpleasant and unfair realities of a society separated from nature and natural behavior. She tries to please her family, not rebel and the price is heavy. And this film is enjoyable just as a viewing experience.",1384646400,,1438,5.046218487394958

Her secret and shame was a lot for a young girl to bear, but the writers brought all the raw pain and the brief escape from it to the audience in a beautiful way. I love through Amazon the ability to sit and watch as many episodes as I want  in a row until the very end of the series. I was like a fish drawn in from episode to episode until the final end.

The woman playing Tess does a perfect job - she has such a sweet, soft voice that is gentle yet strong at the same time, and the character of Angel is the and Alex are what I expected them to be - somewhat too good and somewhat too bad so that one wonders why this fabulous woman ever spent a moment with either of them  Certainly today she would have given both of them them boot in no time flat.  But this story did not take place today and the heroine was a tragic figure destined for the worst life imaginable - to be used by her mother and deserted by many.  The movie is beautifully done and the pacing is perfect so long as you know what to expect.  If you are a fan of a quick shoot 'em up then you may not like this movie - but then, I happen to like many things and love this movie so perhaps you might.  This story is for one who can stand a serious cry because if you don't cry by the end of this story you have no heart at all.  If you are familiar with the story I will say this one is much, much better than the Roman P. version done many years ago.  This one is mostly faithful to the novel.  The  only part that I noticed where they weren't faithful SPOILER ALERT STOP READING HERE IF YOU DON""T KNOW THE STORY  is where Alex is murdered.  The way it was done could have been done better, in my opinion because all that red blood just wouldn't have soaked through the plaster without the bathtub water being let to run.  I also think they rushed the ending a wee bit - I would have liked to have seen just a couple more minutes of the ""honeymooning"" of Angel and Tess as they ran from the police.  The movie makes it look like it was for just a couple of days when it was actually a week or more.  Still, her acceptance of her fate was extremely well done and again, the actress couldn't have been better chosen.",1377820800,,1893,4.037533512064343

3651139,1,B001J4E1D8,The acting is ok. I just hated the whole story line. It was to tragic for my taste. If you want a British movie of this era I would go with Pride & Prejudice or any movies based from Jane Austen that's more uplifting. It's even more tragic than Charlotte Brontes Wuthering Heights.,1377216000,2,281,4.320754716981132
3651140,4,B001J4E1D8,"There is so much in this- this... it can only be accurately described as a masterpiece! Every part, relate-able in some degree; there seems to be deeper meanings to quite a number of the scenes throughout the entire production.  A tragedy, a romance, some comedy, action and adventure! The story of Tess D'Urbervilles has it all. I both hated and loved this film.

I'm upset. I never thought, picking this up, would it provoke such strong emotions in me. Its two in the morning and i'm due to wake in only a few short hours after going to bed right before I played the first episode. I couldn't stop watching. Damn the creator. Damn and bless him/ her in the same breath.  It ended and I would've still watched more given the chance. Damn the entire cast!!

This version highlights different aspects of the story, and thus it has a very different feel, but it is still very true to the book. I think in many ways it is more accurate and forthright than the other miniseries, while the other excels more with impeccable dramatic pacing and ambiance. I love the casting so much in the other miniseries, I had a hard time seeing Alec and Angel as their characters in this production, but this Tess was phenomenal.

We expect love to have one challenge but not impossible challenges. We don't expect to cry from start to finish. Life though isn't fair and I think this story highlights it in ways that might make most uncomfortable. A woman wronged and wronged over again by a vial man, her own family, community, church and in the end I think she wronged herself. She murdered her own future, a moment of insanity I think as her character was stronger than that. I could be wrong in this though. Maybe I wish for the happy ending after all.

3651216,5,B001J4E1D8,I read Tess of the D'urbervilles by Thomas Hardy several years ago.  The film Tess of the D'urbervilles starring Gemma Arterton followed the book beautifully.  Sometimes after reading a book one is dissappointed when viewing the movie but this was not the case with Tess.  The scenery in the film was exactly how I pictured it to be when I was reading the novel.  My favorite part of the film was the way the characters were portrayed and how their acting made you empathize with their plight.  It was convenient to be able to view the film on my computer through my Amazon account.,1363737600,,582,4.5576923076923075

3651256,3,B001J4E1D8,"Thomas Hardy must have been a very unhappy man.

Every time it looks like the plot of this gothic period story might take a happy turn, a character makes a terrible choice that ruins everybody's life.  Poor Tess.  She's doomed, through no fault of her own.  On the other hand, the very fact that this film is ultimately so upsetting attests to the quality of the production.  If you want a happy ending, watch Jane Austen.  If you want to be depressed for a few days, watched Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

You can get the plot from Wikipedia, but what it basically boils down to is this:  Tess is an innocent, beautiful young girl whose inebriated father mistakenly believes his family is descended from royalty.  Eager to better their lot in life, his sends Tess to work for the actual last descendants of the once noble D'Urbervilles, where she is unpleasantly courted and ultimately raped by the young heir.

Tess runs away, has a baby out of wedlock, the baby dies and Tess, determined to make her own way, goes to work on a farm. There, she meets a man she saw once before and instantly fell in love with, and that relationship grows into an innocent, pure love.  He is the son of a wealthy family and wants to marry Tess but the morals of the time being what they are, she refuses, finally agreeing on the basis that she will share the horrible echoes of her past with her new husband.  He accepts this lovingly, but when she confesses the truths of her former immorality, he leaves her, and her life goes rapidly downhill from there.

Tess ends up slaving in a cruel potato factory, where the dreadful young D'Urberville heir who raped her finds her once again.  He's still obsessed with her, and although she refuses his unrelenting advances, her longing for the husband who has deserted her ultimately drives her into his arms.  He has played the one trump card she can't refused:  He's bought her family, making their lives better while destroying Tess'.

Her husband, recovering from a dreadful illness and still in love with Tess, tracks her down, begging forgiveness and anxious to start their marriage in faith.  Tess is now her enemy's mistress, filled with self-loathing and hatred for him.  She commits the ultimate crime to escape her horrible situation, killing the man she hates and fleeing to the one she loves.

The young couple enjoys a period of bliss while trying desperately to escape the recriminations of the Law, and at last, Tess is taken.  She is put to death by hanging, the final page in a tragic chapter of an unreasonably misused life.

This is very well done, all performances outstanding, settings magnificent, fine scripting, directing, producing.  But God, it's depressing.",1360454400,,2710,4.719148936170213

I'm sure some viewers would point out that the unfortunate circumstance she was put in is what would happen to many girls historically, but why would we want to watch it? A sad story works when it doesn't relish in torturing the characters. It should be real and not overdone, here the dialogue was flat and melodramatic. They also felt very cartoonish: she is smart and pretty and innocent, her family is childish and uneducated alcoholics. Why would she be so different?

3651278,3,B001J4E1D8,"What's even more tragic than seeing Tess' life played on-screen, is seeing it portrayed very badly. I felt more like I was watching a high school play with an enormous budget for sets rather than the usual high-caliber of acting I usually find in BBC mini-series adaptations. Having read the book, I could see that Blair attempted to remain faithful to Hardy's novel by including characters, lines and scenes that went missing in the other versions, and I give him credit for that. But the poorly-written script, rushed build-up of Angel and Tess' relationship, and too many awkward scenes made it barely tolerable to watch. It says something if you find yourself rooting for the ""villain"" to win the affections of the leading lady and hope never again to see the lead male's bare buttocks displayed on screen.

As for the three lead actors, I have to admit I've never seen any of them before.

Gemma Arterton as Tess: I was not impressed. It boggles the mind why so many think she gave a powerful performance when the only words that came to my mind while watching her was, ""What the..."" I think she certainly looks the part, but looking the part can only get you so far. It's the deliverance that counts, and I think she struggled to find the right balance in her role, only succeeding in the last installment. I remembered wincing at an earlier scene after Alec comes to fetch Tess from home to go and work at his poultry farm and they are riding in the carriage together. It was extremely painful watching Hans Matheson adequately deliver those lines only to have Arterton open her mouth and make everything seem so - I can't put my finger on it, but - weird. This unsettling, ""off"" feeling continued to plague me, and I just couldn't shake it off.

I believe though that this has less to do with Arterton than it does the director's inability to extract the best performance out of her. You can catch glimpses of the depth of her acting through her expressions which were spot-on, but there was a disconnect between her facial expressions and her voice. I'm not disparaging her. She may not have a pretty voice, but the right director would have been able to reign that monstrosity in and make her utilize it in a way that would add to rather than detract from her character (like Sanjay Leela Bhansali did with Aishwarya Rai in Devdas).

Eddie Redmayne as Angel: Oliver Milburn may be my favorite Angel Clare up to date, but I was ready to give Eddie Redmayne a chance. I hadn't seen him in anything else yet so this would be the platform on which to base my judgement of his acting skills. I have to say that I stumbled away from it all severely disappointed. There was zero chemistry between Redmayne and Arterton, but it's not to say that he didn't try. I think the fault goes to the director as well.

Hans Matherson as Alec: He brought an intensity and vulnerability to his character that I found refreshing. However, I thought having the last scene with Alec be seen in a third person's POV was a big letdown. Alec/Matherson deserved more than that. That was a perfect opportunity to really get him to showcase his performance.

All in all, it was a decent adaptation, but could have been better. The main leads played their roles adequately, but I just wished the director could have extracted better performances out of them as I can catch glimpses of their potential. However, I have to admit that for the most part, the last episode made up for the disappointment felt throughout the rest of my viewing, but that's not enough to warrant a second viewing.",1345507200,2,3570,4.596546310832025

When I watch masterpiece theater I expect fantastic acting especially from the lead character and I didn't get it here. However I did enjoy the actor who played Angel and thought he did a fine job.  The story is depressing so without fantastic acting I just didn't see the point of watching. The actress playing Tess says most of her lines in the exact same whiny inflection.  I found myself confused as to whether I should feel sorry for her or annoyed by her.  All in all I'd say it was ok... but not worthy of masterpiece.,1340668800,,628,4.482456140350878

I thought the acting was generally good to very good, though some characters, at some points, were not very convincing. One of Tess's sisters looked a bit too modern for me, her hairstyle and makeup (what there was of it, of course), looking like something you might see today. One thing I felt played too big a part in this production was the music. There were times when it seemed the director was relying too heavily on the music to set the mood, and perhaps unnecessarily. Other times it was a good fit. I could not help but compare this to the Roman Polanski/Nastassja Kinski version from many years ago, and I don't know which I would choose as better, though by a narrow margin, I think it would go to the older film. I would certainly say that there is little need to see both. Naturally, being produced from the same book, the basics of the story will be the same, but I did not see any smaller points significantly exploited in such a way as to make a big difference. In the first episode of my download, I noticed some fuzziness, poor reproduction quality. I have no way of knowing whether this was the fault of the original film, or of the transmission of it to my computer. That did not influence my opinion of this overall, however. The four stars is based on performance. If you have never seen Tess, I would highly recommend seeing some version of it, whether this one or the Polanski one. There have been other versions which I have not seen, and on which I cannot comment.

You feel terribly sorry for Tess' life and struggle of survival, angry at her unforgiving husband who frankly I blamed just as much for the outcome of her life, and ready to spit at the man who manipulates her to destruction.

great.

Polanski's version makes Tess look like a whore at the end (Angel finds her
looking rather vulgar in a red dress) and has some Gothic kitsch. His version
has no where near the emotional currency of this BBC version though Natassia Kinski
is a beauty. Still her beauty is equalled by, indeed surpassed, by this gorgeous,
stunning actress Gemma Aterton. She is so credible Tess becomes a real presence

In Romeo and Juliette, the battle lines were well drawn, the Capulets against the Montagues, and Romeo and Juliette caught in the middle.

But, with Tess of the d'Urbevilles the battle lines are murky, they change, lovers against the world, lovers against each other, family against lovers, etc., etc.

This is a messy, complicated, wondrous mini-series in which you may think the protagonists, Tess and Angel, got what they deserved, but at the same time, no one deserves what they endured.

All of the leading actors were breathtakingly gorgeous. So if the mini-series goes a bit slow for you at times, you'll at least have eye candy to hold you over until the more dramatic scenes arrive, but there are very few slow spots. The tension is there from beginning to end.

Ignorance, discrimination and betrayal fuel this mini-series, but redemption, atonement and tears bring it to its tragic conclusion.

3651298,4,B001J4E1D8,"Thomas Hardy's Tess Durbeyfield has had at least three film reincarnations in the last thirty years.  All of the women portraying this woebegone heroine are beautiful--Nastassja Kinski in Polanski's feature film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tess-Special-Edition/dp/B0002O7XVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tess (Special Edition)</a>,"" Justine Waddell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-2000/dp/B00003CXSD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula 2000</a>) in the 1998 BBC production for television (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tess-of-the-d-Urbervilles/dp/B000089QEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tess of the d'Urbervilles</a>)  and now former Bond girl Gemma Arterton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace/dp/B001PPLIEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace</a>) in this latest 212 minute version in four parts.  One thing for certain, all three of these women know exactly how to eat a strawberry with all the innocence and inadvertent provocation that would surely drive any man--from any century, repressed or not--mad with desire.

Not since Nastassja Kinski has an actress depicted such nave sensuality, as does Gemma Arterton as the ill-fated Tess.  Even without speaking, Arterton epitomizes vulnerable femininity with her lovely porcelain complexion set off by long tresses of dark brown hair, punctuated by full red lips and warmed by the fathomless brown eyes of a doe. Yet this reliance on the physical to embody the spirit of Tess by no means suggests that Arterton's performance is vacuous.  Perhaps her youth, like that of the character she is portraying, works in her favor--but it is her ability to bring to the surface that quality of sweet innocence that puts her in almost the same category as the alluring girl-woman Kinski.

Waddell's Tess, although beautiful in another way--remember her portrayal as Estella in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Expectations-Masterpiece-Theatre-1999/dp/B0002XVRGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Expectations (Masterpiece Theatre, 1999)</a>, seems feistier, more knowing and less susceptible to the wiles of the mesmerized yet confused men in her life.  Perhaps, her eyes do not convey the same wonder at the dualities of the world.  Waddell's Tess already seems primly aggrieved by the trials and tribulations of her life; her face reflects her accrued experience.

Similarly, the other actors in this ensemble will work or not work for you depending on the extent of your familiarity with and expectations of Thomas Hardy's characterizations.  If you like your Tess sweet, vulnerable and undeniably attractive, then Arterton will amply fill the bill. Hans Matheson, as the despicable Alex Stokes-D'Urberville (black-hearted misunderstood Mordred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mists-of-Avalon/dp/B00005QW5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mists of Avalon</a>) undeniably personifies the dastardly qualities of the villain with a sneering, not at all self-deprecating, self-acceptance and `who cares?' arrogance that seems true to type.  However, this reviewer found his reappearance and reinsertion in Tess's life a little hurried.  Indeed, the audience understands the feeling of obligation that Tess once felt for her family at the opportunistic prodding of her mother, but I didn't think this sense of resignation was adequately portrayed simply because it was allotted little screen time.  On the other hand, the behind the scenes glimpse through the keyhole of the boardinghouse as Alex and Tess argue as seen through the eyes of landlady, Mrs. Brooks spectacularly depicts the depravity of the cruel life Tess reluctantly endures with Alex.

The role of Angel Clare played by Eddie Redmayne (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/POWDER-BLUE/dp/B001URA5Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">POWDER BLUE</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/B0012QE4Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>) at first seems miscast.  However, his innocent scenes of love with Arterton's Tess, are bucolic to behold.  Filmed against lush fields and mooing cows, the audience sees and enjoys the purity and magnetism of the halcyon days of first love.  In contrast, Angel's hypocritical withdrawal from what could have been a wonderful life of committed sharing in another part of the world appears all the more marked as does the increased emotional release Redmayne's character must expel as he ricochets from feelings of impending doom and the simple joy of being at long last with the woman that he loves.  Redmayne's oddly shaped face showcases a boy becoming a man--possessing the same brand of innocence as his Tess.  His struggles to be of the world and above the world mature him yet do not defeat him.

Other characters of note in this production are Tess's three milkmaid friends and the heartlessly cruel Groby (Christopher Fairbank) whose mere presence had this reviewer shuddering in trepidation each time he appeared on the screen.  In addition, Ruth Jones, as Tess's subtly scheming mother, portrays with distinction a conniving opportunist willing to use her daughter to gain financial happiness.

Bottom line?  The 2008 BBC presentation of Thomas Hardy's ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"" successfully conveys the storyline and emotional impact of an impoverished woman's plight in the late 19th century.  Gemma Arterton looks as if she could walk right out of a Monet painting; her beauty palpably represents the innocent insouciance of Hardy's Tess--a girl child in a woman's body.  Her male leads do not overpower her, but set off her desire for love and her innate naivety from both ends of the spiritual spectrum.  Viewers who have not read the novel be cautioned that all ends badly despite the audience's best and most hopeful wishes.  Recommended to all lovers of the Masterpiece Theatre genre as a faithful adaptation of Hardy's classic tragedy.

The obvious issues of chauvinism and societal 'standards' will have you throwing things at the screen. You'll cheer Tess when she finds her voice and tells her mother 'what for' and wonder where it went when she submits to the control of others.

3651300,5,B001J4E1D8,"Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a completely captivating film, minute to minute.  Gemma Arterton was amazing and subtley yet dramatically nuanced as Tess's life situation changed.  I am a real fan of hers after this. Hans Matheson was excellently dark and forboding in his role as Alec, while Eddie Redmayne was alluring and vibrant as Tess's true love, Angel Clare.
  Let me give you the real impact.  I showed it to my Drama classes toward the end of the school year.  They were absolutely riveted.  I never had such certain, regular attendance, no tardies even, because they were dying to know what would happen next.  They were on the edge of their seats from the start to the end of each class.  I did ease them into it in the beginning, explaining that the movie would begin slowly as the expository information about the name ""D'Urberville"", the nature of the countryside, and the lifestyles of the characters were revealed.
  One more hint about the excellence of this movie lies in the fact that over the three-day Memorial Day weekend, one of my students called me begging me to let her borrow the dvd's because she was so in need of finding out how the story turned out.  I mean she sounded really desperate.  The next week, she had put a photo of Eddie Redmayne in her cell phone.

Every important scene is re-created, and Gemma Arterton very much becomes Tess as I imagine Hardy himself must have envisioned her. As others have noted, the character of Angel Clare is poorly represented, but that in no meaningful way detracts from the power or indeed the visual beauty herein.

She's brilliantly portrayed by Gemma Arterton. The story is Old English & depressing of the times. Tess is depended on way too much by her family for their survival. And of course, Tess is like a rag doll that keeps getting pins stuck in her to make her suffer just about the entire series. I realize this is an older storyline, but why torture her until there is nothing left of her--the most abused & USED & abused character, to torture anymore. And the supposed love of her life, Angel, was a weak-weak-weak man. He's committed sins, yet won't forgive her past that was not even HER sin, but another man's sin. I don't like movies like this with goodie-too-shoes people who condemn the victims of things they cannot control. When Angel, Tess' husband, runs away for about two years he should never have come back. For there is Tess--the rag doll with more pins being stuck through her by even her own family, in sacrificing herself just to appease & give her greedy mother a means of sustenance. None of her family cared anything for Tess. And wasn't it convenient when Tess---yet again--told ""her husband"" to marry her sister & take care of the family, who used her just as much as the other abusers, when her fate was sealed. How the sister smiled & clung to Angel, obviously being thrilled to b provided for when no more Tess existed. In some ways, Tess was not a mentally stable person for just going along with the hard work & abusers. I found it strange that she didn't live in the House of D'Urbervilles home that Angel gave Tess upon marriage. His family would have helped her. Her mother could have worked, because her other children were of school age & the girl marriageable age. None of them made an effort to work. This movie/series is all about abuse, weakness, & stupidity--the way I see it. No more Tess---her immediate family live happily ever after. The series was well adapted, but way too overdone with all the sacrifices Tess made. Didn't that make her a bit off in the head to allow such things, endure hardships when she really should have thought of her own survival.  Yes, I give it two stars for the above reasons. If it had been reality then Tess' sister who would b glad to take her husband, should have been the one to sacrifice. Remember, she did make Tess promise her to not leave her at home---she wanted escape & in the final analysis the sister got her husband & escape too. Enough said.

Again, the book and Polanski film are wonderful, this adaptation is horrid.",1516060800,,607,4.428571428571429
