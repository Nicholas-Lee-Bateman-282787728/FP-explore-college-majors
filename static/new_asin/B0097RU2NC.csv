8537501,3,B0097RU2NC,"First of all, I have to give a 5 stars to the content themselves. No doubt, the games contained are all fantastic games, and I can only encourage continued releases from Bombo of classic NBA games. There really is a market for those of us who want to have legal copies of classic games.

The shame is, however, that 4/5 of the games selected can already be found on the New York 'Dynasty Series' which I already own - and which comes with eight games rather than 5.

As of right now, the Dynasty Collection can still be found on Amazon, and for only 5 dollars more why would you not take that series which has 4 other fantastic classic games rather than the one additional recent game?

It's really a shame that they didn't look to include 5 different games - there are other great games in New York history to consider, and even a collection of the 7 games which made up 'Linsanity' would have been potentially a better set to add to the collection. A rerelease of the Dynasty Series adding a game or two beyond 2004 may also have been a better option.

(Note - there are also Celtics and Bulls releases in this series. The Celtics release includes no new games at all, however the previouis releases of the five games are split over 4 different collections, so this is better value if you have interest in the specific games rather than being a completionist. The Bulls series seems to be the best value of all, with 4/5 games being ones I am not aware of being otherwise available.)

I do really want to reiterate, however, that the content itself is great and I love the concept of the essentials collection, and hope that they go beyond the standard 'Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, Knicks' model and bring us some of the great games from other great and storied franchises such as the Suns, Nuggets, Blazers, Sonics/Thunder and Bucks.",1351728000,9,1832,4.506024096385542
