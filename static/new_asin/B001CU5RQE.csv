8470659,2,B001CU5RQE,"I recieved this DVD in the mail today and I, like most people would, opened it up and put it in my DVD player first thing.  After several failed attempts to load and/or read the disc I moved the DVD to my desktop computer to watch it...again, I had the same problem, nothing was being read from the disc.  I then, went to my laptop (as a last resort).  Can you guess what happened next...?  That's correct...not a damn thing!  I am extrememly disappointed in this product.  I'm not sure if it was the sellers who made a copy from the original, or if it was the History Channel fault...but be carful when buying anything from here!!!!",1269475200,,633,4.367521367521367
