8732468,5,B0152AW2BW,"If you read Ken Dornstein's book, ""The Boy Who Fell from the Sky,"" you know that his brother, David Dornstein, was aboard the doomed Pan Am 103 Maid of the Seas flight on December 21, 1988. Ken Dornstein searches for answers about the bombing. He traveled to Libya, Switzerland, Germany and Scotland. He has a wife and two children at home in Boston, Massachusetts. Ken has worked for PBS' Frontline series. This three hour documentary covered his endless and tireless search for the truth about Pan Am 103.

Ken interviewed and befriended many people during his journey to uncover the truth. Ken couldn't get to meet Megrabi, the only convicted Libyan in the Pan Am 103 bombing. He was on his deathbed by this time in Libya. Ken and Jim Swire, another relative whose daughter died on Pan Am 103, become friends. He even brings some disturbing truth about Megrabi to Jim Swire.

The DVD has no other special features though. I would have liked to have seen more about Pan Am 103, news coverage and history of the bombing.",1522886400,,1021,4.666666666666667
