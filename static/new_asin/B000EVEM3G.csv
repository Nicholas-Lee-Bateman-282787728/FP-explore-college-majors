8114678,1,B000EVEM3G,"If one is looking to get into Yoga, or if one has been practicing yoga for a while, this DVD makes no sense. The entirety of the DVD is a Sun Salutation which on a real Yoga DVD is simply the warm up. It provides a small range of motion, and almost no resistance. If anyone would like a quality yoga dvd/experience they should buy a dvd from Baron Baptiste...he's the best in the biz.",1260230400,,384,4.133333333333334
