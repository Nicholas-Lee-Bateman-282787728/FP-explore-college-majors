8507925,5,B0070ZDMVM,"A gem! Alejandra Manzo, who plays Anita, is simply marvelous; she's a great actress. Anita has Down syndrome, as does the actress. Never having spoken with a person with Down syndrome, I can't say whether Manzo's characterization is reaslistic or exaggerated. It's a pity that I don't speak Spanish because there's an interview with her on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpjb3kfYjO4). The rest of the cast is excellent without exception.",1424476800,,447,5.686567164179104

8507927,5,B0070ZDMVM,"I first saw this movie at a film festival a few years ago and was so moved by it.  It will have you feeling every emotion.  After the festival, I looked around to see if I could purchase it but could never find it.  Though we saw many film festival films since then, this one always stuck in my mind and I wished I would get another chance to see it.  The film festival was held again this year and it reminded me to check again to see if I could find a copy anywhere.  And here it is!  I immediately bought a copy.  My husband doesn't like foreign films, especially ones with subtitles, but even he thought this was a great movie!",1400198400,,631,4.08130081300813
8507928,5,B0070ZDMVM,This is a beautiful movie which reflects on the impact one individual can have on others.  A moving story about a young lady with Down Syndrome that changes the lives of those she comes across on her voyage home.,1388188800,,212,4.435897435897436

8507930,5,B0070ZDMVM,"I bought the movie because it starred Norma Aleandro, but as it happens her role (although important) is little more than a walk on. The key protagonist is her daughter, afflicted with Downe syndrome, who is left alone and motherless after a bombing.  The daughter, played by Alejandra Manzo (who actually has Downe syndrome) is treated at a local hospital and then walks out, alone, to try to find her mother and brother.  Along the way she meets various people, each with their own problems, who help her in various ways and, in turn, are enriched by the encounters.  This could have been a depressing movie, message movie, or tele novela, but is surpisingly unsentimental.  To be sure, everyone will have tears in their eyes at various points in the film, but it is really uplifting.  Alejandra Manzo is terrific in the film and so are several other characters, notably Leonor Menso, who plays a nurse with her own problems.  This is a film that is worth watching more than once.",1365811200,5,982,4.713450292397661
8507931,5,B0070ZDMVM,Anita was amazing. I love the young actress who played Anita.  She should win an award for her performance.  Does anyone know if she won anything for her portrayal of Anita?,1356393600,,173,4.548387096774194
8507932,5,B0070ZDMVM,"a very heart warming story,,,centering around the tragic bombing of the amia,in buenos aires,,,how a young downs syndrome,,,reunites with her family after the bombing",1350345600,,166,5.958333333333333
8507933,5,B0070ZDMVM,"""Anita"" is a heart-warming Argentine film which follows the titular character, a young woman with Down syndrome, on her journey home through the streets of Buenos Aires in the aftermath of a horrific terrorist attack. Anita (played by the wonderful Alejandra Manzo, in her acting debut) is not used to being on her own- early on we see her comfortable life, being cared for by her loving mother Dora (veteran Argentine actress & Academy Award nominee Norma Aleandro). This idyllic opening also introduces us to Anita's older brother Ariel (Peto Menahem), who does not share Anita's disability, but clearly loves his sister despite his brusque attitude (clearly harboring some lingering resentment). And so life goes on for the Feldman family, until one morning Anita is left momentarily in the family shop while her mother runs to the local Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) to pick up their disability check. Then the explosion hits.

The 1994 terrorist attack on the AMIA in Buenos Aires was the deadliest bombing in Argentina's history, but ""Anita"" does not delve into the why or how of this devastating attack, nor its impact on the Jewish population. Instead, we see things through the eyes of Anita, who in the aftermath of the explosion is left dazed & lost, wandering through the streets searching for her mother. While Anita seems totally helpless to the people she encounters along her journey - an alcoholic photographer living on the edge, a family of Asian immigrants who run a market, a older woman with shady connections - soon it becomes clear that these people are just as in need of saving as Anita, if not more so. Anita's innocence and child-like wonder acts as a beacon of light to these lost souls as she passes through their lives.

While this all sounds terribly cheesy and cloying, in the hands of director Marcos Carnevale (director of art-house hit ""Elsa & Fred"") the film never veers into shameless sentimentality. The film's subtle, natural style lets the performances and writing shine through, especially the work of Ms. Manzo, who carries the film on her shoulders, never letting her disability define her character. ""Anita"" also features traditionally excellent work from Norma Aleandro, who in her few scenes makes an impression that lasts the entire film. Finally, ""Anita""'s unsung hero is Peto Menahem as Anita's brother, who spends the film desperately searching for Anita even while struggling with the possibility that he has lost his family. His emotional journey is honest and powerful, and anchors the film.

Don't let your first impression fool you - while ""Anita"" does feature a protagonist with Down syndrome, by no means is it a ""disability"" film. Instead, Marcos Carnevale has created something far more universal. ""Anita"" shines a light on the very bonds that connect family and community, especially in times of crisis. When things are at their darkest, sometimes it takes a person like Anita to remind us that we are not alone in the world, that we are all in this together. As I see that ""Anita"" has won numerous awards at US film festivals thus far, it seems that audiences in America have begun to discover just that.",1336435200,10,3182,4.977443609022556
