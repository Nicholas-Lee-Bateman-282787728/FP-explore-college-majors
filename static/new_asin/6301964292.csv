382577,4,6301964292,"Not bad mid-60's sci-fi adventure.  A group of scientists, aboard a state-of-the-art submersible the size of two recreational trailers, have to implant a series of underwater sensors on the ocean floor to detect earthquakes.  Along the way they come across wads of adventure and a ton of personal soap-opera drama.  Stars a bunch of notable TV and Movie actors from the era.  Lloyd Bridges (Sea Hunt), Marshall Thompson (Daktari), David McCallum (Man from U.N.C.L.E.), Keenan Wynn (assorted movies from the 40's and 50's), Brian Kelly (Flipper), Shirley Eaton (Goldfinger).  The two most objectionable characters, to me, were Brian Kelly as a profoundly sexist scientist, and Shirley Eaton as the token female scientist who in some ways seemed rather icy and calculating, though sexy.  It's obvious she has a sexual history with both Thompson and McCallum.  It doesn't seem to bother them but it drives Kelly out of his gourd.  Kelly and Eaton are clearly interested in each other.  If they end up together she'll have a hard row to hoe with him.  He'll push her to drop-kick her career and always resent and throw in her face her past romances.  Good luck babe.  The film is not bad and at times entertaining.  The Warner Archives DVD-R is excellent quality.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1452297600,,1295,4.962790697674419

One of the bright spots was watching the female character smoking in the submarine, I chuckled.  I cannot image that would be a good thing to do in a sub, but that one I will agree was due to the date the movie was made, smoking was the thing to do.

382607,4,6301964292,"I really like this movie - the plot is a little silly. The sea monster is even sillier but I like the tone of this film and love the underwater cinematography. This is a nice pairing with Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (the film - not the show). Love the ensemble cast - Keenan Wynn in particular and David McCallum (Man From Uncle)... My only gripe is the full screen presentation. Not certain how they can't find a widescreen print - especially given the gorgeous underwater scenes. UPDATE - my prior review was for the streaming version, the DVD (burned on demand) is actually WIDESCREEN - Kudos to Warner for that ... big questionmark as to why we are relegated to widescreen when streaming.... seek this one out.

382659,3,6301964292,"There are so many technical mistakes in this movie it's funny at times. The submarine is pressurized at sea level. They go down to 30,000 ft deep and leave the submarine swim around then get back in the sub with no depressurization. First of all if a human were in a submarine and went outside into water that deep they would end up the size of a marble from the ocean pressure. Even if they could do that if they went back into a submarine with sea level pressure without depressurizing they would explode. Another mistake is you never dive without a buddy. They did it several times. Either they didn't have enough money to film the technical aspects or they had a 5 year old as tech advisor.",1402876800,,694,4.387596899224806

You broke the sub."")  So, since I can get just about everything else from Amazon, I did a search to see if this movie existed.  Amazon has surprised me more than a few times by having just about EVERYTHING, so I was more satisfied than surprised to find that ""Around the World Under the Sea"" was available.  Considering when it was made (1960s), I thought it was a pretty good film.  Obviously, the special effects don't hold up very well to today's standards.

But no, I got sucker-punched.

This disc, labeled Turner Classics and Warner Home Video is crippled with heavy handed anti-piracy code. I could not play this disc on my computer's DVD drive, or several other machines. Jeez. I was all set to return the disc, and I even printed out the return label, when I tried an older Chinese made DVD player. A Coby model. It played fine and the picture quality was rather good.

382735,2,6301964292,"Dating from 1966, this film was designed mainly as a vehicle for some leading TV actors of that time.  The storyline involves a team of oceanographers setting up a network of underwater sensors.  The premise of this film exemplifies the optimism about scientific discovery that was common in the early 1960s. Because the plot is so sparse, the film is mainly a collection of episodes.  The characters are for the most part rather simplistic -- David McCallum is devious, Lloyd Bridges is heroic, Keenan Wynn is peevish, and Brian Kelly is prejudiced against women.

382758,3,6301964292,"Following the destruction of much of coastal Turkey by a massive tsunami, American scientists Dr. Doug Standish (a mugging Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Craig Mosby (Brian Kelly playing kind of a sexist jerk) lead the crew of the submarine Hydronaut in a race to plant seismic sensors along fault lines on the ocean floor to create an experimental earthquake detection system in order to prevent other coastal countries from suffering the same fate. The crew consists of geologist Orin Hillyard (Marshall Thompson), electronics expert Dr. Philip Volker (David McCallum doing a hokey German accent) and marine biologist Margaret Hanford (the fetching Shirley Eaton as what basically amounts to eye candy). Also along for the ride is reclusive survival expert Hank Stahl (a delightfully curmudgeonly Keenan Wynn).

While at times enjoyable, Around the World Under the Sea is, alas, a bit on the boring side. It isn't that badly written, not for a movie of its type, anyway, but in its apparent drive to depict the science fiction elements as realistically as possible (in a ""this is totally plausible"" sort of way), it tends to bog down. We spend far too much time focusing on the Hydronaut crew planting the various sensors that midway through the film a montage of them doing it gets the bulk of that out of the way to make way for... well, not undersea adventure, that's for sure.

There is some of that, but it's few and far between and mostly, when the movie isn't methodically showing us in detail how they do various scientific tasks, it basically plays out like a soap opera set on a submarine: Volker wants to do a salvage dive for some valuable crystals but is opposed (for some reason the movie never bothers explaining) by Stahl, and the two have an epic chess game to decide whether they'll do it (Volker cheats!); Hanford is ostensibly Hillyard's girlfriend at the start, but starts falling for Mosby despite him being kind of a sexist pig, and on top of this she's Volker's ex and there is unresolved tension between them. The movie seems to think that this is all more interesting than giant eels and erupting undersea volcanoes. It would be wrong.

One thing of note is the sexism against Dr. Hanford that Craig Mosby has, and, to some extent, so does the movie. With comments like ""she's as good with a skillet as she is with a scalpel,"" it at times feels like a movie from a much earlier film, far less tolerant of women in the workplace. When Hanford is late for the Hydronaut's takeoff, the chief concern regarding her is that they can't set sail without a cook (!). If nothing else, at least the poor woman gets support from Standish if no one else, who points out ""She's a scientist and so are we"" and doesn't find the idea of female astronauts at all unusual, and hires her on the spot even once he learns the mysterious and overqualified ""M.E. Hanford"" is a woman, whilst it is Mosby who objects to having a woman aboard the sub. Still, most of it just seems like lip service, as, despite Standish's insistence in her abilities, all supposed marine biologist Hanford ever really does is ""woman"" stuff like serving coffee while Stahl (who isn't even a scientist) does most of the specimen collecting and lab work.

This nonsense aside, it has its moments. There's a close call where Hillyard is burned by an undersea vent and has to be rescued by Volker, as well as a giant moray eel which attacks the sub, and a fairly satisfying climax involving a giant underwater volcano and a rock slide which buries the sub, trapping our heroes and forcing them to use their quick wits to escape. Recommended for viewers with lots and lots of patience. For a far better and more enjoyable undersea adventure flick, see either 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.",1344384000,4,3794,4.683658170914542

This is a wonderful movie, with everything in it for everyone. An All-Star cast with an action story.

This is a movie for 'today' because of its accurate predictions of tsunamis, undersea volcanoes, flooding and global warming.

I have a widescreen DVD copy of the movie along with its original soundtrack and ""Its behind the scenes making"" courtesy of TCM.
Turner shows the movie on occassion with scenes from ""Flipper and other Ivan Tors features.
But if you like adventure, scuba diving, Lloyd Bridges, ""Goldfingers"" Shirley Bassey, Keenan Wynn or ""Man From Uncle"" David McCallum this movie has it all and beautifully photographed.
...now will they ever release it on DVD?
see it and explore the wonders!

Throw in Brian Kelly from Flipper and what's not to love? I saw this movie at the Saturday matintee (along with King Kong vs Godzilla, Our Man Flint and a bunch more) and loved it.  I wish they would release this one on DVD.",1108684800,18,364,4.432835820895522

7817457,2,6301964292,Pretty lame - movie isn't an undersea version of Around the World in 80 days. Plot thin. Instant lust becomes insta-love - lot of stars of the day though,1521676800,,153,4.310344827586207

7817462,4,6301964292,"Lloyd Bridges is back in the water and does an admirable job. The story puts the viewer in mind of Star Trek under water. Jacques Cousteau  probably wouldn't agree with any of it, but it's fun, exciting, and adventurous. Great for the entire family except very young children.",1495670400,,276,4.75
7817463,5,6301964292,A movie that was very important to me as a very young person. Well done and fun to walk down memory lane. If you are interested in an underwater story that is not completely 100% fiction than this is a good movie to see. It also has some underwater gear from the 60s in action along with some fiction.,1495411200,,301,4.11864406779661
