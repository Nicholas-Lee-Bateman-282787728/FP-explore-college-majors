8224867,4,B000WPJ6NA,"This recent entry in the Juxtapositions series of documentaries on contemporary classical music features two films with a spotlight on Tan Dun. The Chinese-born New York resident composer has won wide acclaim over the last 15 years for his music where East meets West.

Frank Scheffer's film TEA (2005) works best as a making-of production to accompany the Deutsche Grammophon DVD of Tan Dun's opera&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tea-A-Mirror-of-Soul/dp/B0002UNQGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tea: A Mirror of Soul</a>. Chronicling the 2002 Tokyo premiere by the Netherlands Opera and the NHK Symphony Orchestra, it features interviews with Tan Dun, the librettist Xu Ying, and the director Pierre Audi. I think the opera is pretty weak, but the documentary did increase my enjoyment of it somewhat by showing how many of the jerky, erratic mannerisms in the initial scenes are derived from Chinese shadow puppetry.

The second film is Eline Flipse's BROKEN SILENCE (1995). Covering much more than Tan Dun, it tells of several other Chinese composers who grew up during the Cultural Revolution and were stunned by the discovery of Western music after China opened up in the late '70s. We meet Chen Qigang, who studied with Messiaen. Qu Xiaosong entered music only at the age of 20 after falling in love with opera. His style is marked by very few notes, held at great lengths with powerful but imperfect silences between. Guo Wenjing is the only composer profiled here who chose to stay in China, writing Western music for exotic Chinese instruments. All these composers roomed together at the Beijing Conservatory, and there's an amusing scene where they talk about the difficulties of dormitory life. Further laughs come when we see vocalists of the Nieuwe Ensemble trying really hard to pronounce Chinese, with mixed success. Especially poignant is footage of Mo Wuping, a composer who impressed many listeners in Holland and France before he died of cancer at the age of 33 in 1992. The music of these composers is given only as extracts in the background, but the film does inspire the viewer to seek out recordings.

For people who merely like the music of Tan Dun, this DVD is entertaining but may not be worth the purchase unless you really like his ""Tea"" opera. However, if you are interested in the wider theme of Chinese composers encountering and moving to the West, Flipse's film is relevatory.",1219536000,2,2451,5.247448979591836
