8672102,5,B00MGBS4WW,"An accurate discription of the inner-city phenomenon known as black top basketball. A fine job by all the participants of sharing the many years of sport, love, and friendship that develops over many years of meeting at ""The Graveyard"", a place where egos are checked at the gate, and legacies are formed......",1420329600,,310,4.980769230769231
8672103,4,B00MGBS4WW,"Big-hearted doc about the players (almost all African-American, between 20 and 45) who meet every weekend for basketball in 'The Graveyard' -Washington Park in Albany. They've been going for years, a generation played before them, and their kids will play there next.

For the first half we watch the play, the pushing, the struggle for who has 'next', the arguments about every call (a number of players admit they're willing to lie through their teeth), and the trash talk -- the best have turned it into an effective weapon to get in the heads and melt down the emotions of their opponents. But there is also a whole lot of laughter and love between these men who look forward all week to coming out to the park, seeing their old friends, letting off steam. There's also racial politics. White players can get in, but you gotta earn your place, and the guys aren't going to make it easy. White player (and co-director), Basil says he likes to not be in the position of privilege for once, to have to go the extra mile to prove he belongs. And if you're some kid who thinks he's cool, you better be ready to back it up, or these 'old men' will play you right off the court.

But what takes the film to another level is the 2nd half, where we get to know these men away from the courts. In 'real life' they're mostly gentle, kind people, most of whom work serving others, whether as a teacher, a judge, or working at a halfway house. It's a lesson in not judging books by their covers; the ferocious street-wise manner on the court is only one side of these men, who also have big hearts and big minds to go with their (often funny) big on-court egos.

The camera-work is rudimentary, the crew was tiny, and the whole thing looks like it cost a dime to make. But when you've got a good story, with good characters, everything else will find a way. It may never win an Oscar, just like these guys will never be NBA players. But they both got game.",1417824000,,1947,4.38781163434903
8672104,5,B00MGBS4WW,"This is a wonderful story, masterfully told. It's a basketball movie. It's an Albany story. But it's about much more than that. It's about life, tradition and respect. I loved it in the theater and can't wait to get my DVD.",1412467200,,223,4.463414634146342
8672105,5,B00MGBS4WW,"Wow. A great film. Took my son to see it when it played in Albany and can't wait to buy the DVD. Definitely much, much more than a sports doc. A deep, unexpectedly emotional journey, from the gritty (and hilarious) world of urban pickup basketball to some heart-tugging, truly inspiring life stories of some players. It will really make you sit up and think. My son LOVED it too. This should be seen by a wide audience.",1408579200,,419,4.454545454545454
