5086991,2,B007HOK77I,I don't reccommend this tape.  The work out is not difficult and doesnt feel like it does much - wish I didn't buy it,1360713600,,117,3.875
5086992,3,B007HOK77I,"OK, I'm a big Denise Austin fan, but in my opinion, this is not her best work. First off, I like it better when she does more intermediate videos. This one is more on the beginner side. And I think 15 min could have fit into 10 min. For a better ab workout, check out her Personal Training video. I love the ab workout on that one. But if you are a beginner and want to tone up your abs, this could be a good option which is why I gave it 3 stars. There is a little bit of cardio in the 1st workout, but not enough to burn any serious calories. Overall, good toning workout for abs, but those who do ab workouts regularly won't be challenged.",1359936000,23,642,3.9844961240310077
5086993,5,B007HOK77I,This dvd to will your abs out in areas you didn't know you had. Shrink and tone belly fat it did. Use this dvd at least 4 times a week along with cardio and you are set to see some awesome results. Great dvd for those mothers that still have the muffin top belly of pregenancy!,1358985600,3,277,3.9642857142857144
5086994,3,B007HOK77I,"I have the older Denise Austin Ab workout which I must say I like much better than this one for a workout (not the vocals LOL). In this DVD, The Cardio Ab segment was more like gymnastics with a weight in one hand and balance, than ab work (I know the core is all about balance as I have been working out for 15 years), I found that one is not good for me as I have two trick knees. The second segment, Athletic Abs is much better and seems to concentrate more on the abs and is do-able for me even with a damaged rotator cuff(be careful if you have any arm or shoulder issues as this one has a lot of Pilates type plank positions). The Classic is a waste of time, not sufficient instruction prior to going into each exercise and I felt nothing, rather do my Swiss ball ab work or her old Ab tape or the old Rachel McLish tape, than the classic segment. So I gave it three stars for the Athletic Abs segment. I guess if you are in your prime, the Cardio one is good, just not for me. I just do my normal cardio then do the Athletic Abs segment. Kudos to the toned down voice and the warm up stretches.",1358467200,,1101,4.009090909090909
5086995,5,B007HOK77I,I like Denise Austin's upbeat manner and this is a great workout that you will feel the next day - in a good way.,1355529600,10,113,3.75
5086996,5,B007HOK77I,"This is another wonderful dvd from Denise. I am a big fan of hers, so this dvd was a great addition to my collection. I use it on the days that I am not doing aerobics.
There are 3 different workouts about fifteen minutes long. One of them gets your heart rate up and the others are pure toning for the tummy.
This is a great addition to any fittness routine. It will work your abs and get them nice and toned. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good abs workout. I love the fact that they are not long routines, who has the time these days. Denises workouts are short, sweet, and effective!! Love her!",1355270400,18,612,4.151260504201681
5086997,5,B007HOK77I,"Wow, Denise really delivered with this DVD. Someone before me already gave a good breakdown of the exercises included so my review will be more general...

OVERALL: The DVD comes with with options to customize playback... you can play any of the sections in any order you want... and it comes with a ""Music Only"" option, too, which is nice. Denise is quietly encouraging in this; she has really toned it down over the last few years. Her cueing is decent here, though not stellar. I highly recommend watching this DVD all the way through for two reasons: 1)It is an ab workout so some of the moves will be awkward to have to look at the tv the whole time and 2) The difficulty level really varies between the three sections and the modification and form pointers tend to come after Denise has already started the exercise. These two things in NO WAY detract from the quality of these workouts... just know to plan ahead a little.

Cardio Abs: Perhaps better called ""Standing Abs"", this section is the easiest of them all. It will have some cardio benefit for beginners, but not so much for everyone else. That said, this is a wonderful section that works your balance and your obliques quite well and has a ""functional fitness"" vibe to it that I can get behind. I liked this section A LOT (best suited for my level of fitness right now) and I could definitely feel it the next day. It would be easy to fly through this section and complain that it doesn't work, but you have to really mentally focus on the muscles you're working with standing ab work. Level: Beginner/Low Intermediate

Athletic Abs: Make sure you have a cushiony mat if you have sensitive knees, there is quite a bit of kneeling in the first few minutes of this workout. Also, if you don't watch any of the other sections before doing them DEFINITELY do so with this section. Some of the moves are more advanced and are not meant to have you craning your neck at the TV. Overall, I had a tough time with this section and will have to work up to a couple of the moves. The section ends with some really great back work that I will incorporate into other workouts. Level: SOLID Intermediate

Classic Abs: Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. I felt this for three days afterward. This is, as the title suggests, classic floorwork but with some pilates style twists to spice it up. But that ""spice"" still consists of a lot of crunches. Denise provides a couple of short (and much needed) rests/stretches, but this was an endurance test for me. Totally worth it, though, because it really torched my lower abs; a tough spot to target. It's hard to name an ability level for this one because anyone can do the moves but Beginners should prepare for some pain when tackling this section.

I highly recommend this DVD. I feel like you can start with ""Cardio Abs"" if you are a beginner and work your way up to and through the other sections over time, so you get a lot of bang for your buck in that way. For the more advanced folks, you are getting a great variety of moves that are interesting and safely done. And, finally, I appreciate that Denise tries to balance the ab work with at least a little back work, something that can go missing with Ab focused workouts (though, thankfully, the trend is swinging to more focus on the back muscles).",1355184000,47,3288,4.482470784641069

5086999,5,B007HOK77I,"The 411 by Maria:

OK granted I cannot do the exercises right now as my abdominal surgery was less than 3 weeks ago but I have been watching Denise Austin DVDs since well, before she was on DVD. I must have had at least 5 Denise Austin VHS tapes that I would use to do my workouts. I credit Denise with the lines I had on either side of my stomach for a good 8 years in my 20's. She does a killer workout and this DVD is no different.

The Cardio has some challenging moves and is nice and fast.  You can get a great cardio that concentrates on your core muscles.

The Athletic Abs uses weights and a yoga mat. I love the side crunches that will also work you inner thigh. Great extensions for a great back work out too.  Once the body is healed these are some great exercises to get my core strengthened again. The exercises look amazing, easy and I am excited to get started as soon as I get the OK from my doctor.

Classic Abs uses all those tried and true exercises that exercise gurus have used forever.

For under $13.00 you get a great DVD full of exercises that will have you toned and your tummy looking amazing.

My favorite part of this DVD and I don't know maybe others have this option too but I have never seen it. You don't need to listen to the instruction. You can listen to music while watching. Great option. Sometimes the instructors voices and encouragement can be annoying.",1346889600,12,1395,4.2377358490566035

5087027,4,B007HOK77I,"I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 but this is still an excellent video for someone in great shape, up to 40 years old. I am a senior citizen and in great shape and broke out in a sweat on all three workouts. They are divided into 3 15 min. high cardio moves. I rated the first, cardio abs, as good. The moves were mixed with stuff from prior videos and were mainly standing, kicking, bending. The 2nd workout, athletic abs, is done half the time on your knees and not good for anyone with knee probs--however it could be modified. there were some new moves which required some balance and were hard for me to do, but felt I got a good workout. No. 3 is done mainly on the back, again for the abs. some were familiar but I did feel not too repetitive. Each workout included a short warmup and cooldown. All in all, I felt energized and pretty good after working out. (typically do 30 min and vary my dvds every day). Denise is also every upbeat and encouraging.

5087038,3,B007HOK77I,Another reviewer said this was more on the beginner side...maybe our definition of beginner are vastly different but a real beginner would be out of shape for the few plank moves she did because they were intermediate and too difficult for me to do. I do Jillian Michaels a couple times a week with some other cardio dvds but saw this at my video store and decided to try it out. She is amazing for stretching out the back it felt like I was stretching muscles I haven't used in a very long time. That being said every other move was too easy then the planks were too hard I'd rather have something in the middle because once I can do the planks this workout won't be enough for me anymore. but it's great for stretching out the back,1396569600,2,733,4.280575539568345
5087039,5,B007HOK77I,I enjoy this DVD because the three different ab workouts provide so much variety in assisting one to strengthen the core. The first workout incorporates cardio which was a welcome change to traditional floor routines. I highly recommend buying this DVD as a way to focus on abs in addition to a traditional workout routine. I like the option of focusing on my abs when I'm short on time or when I've done a cardio workout and want to add an ab routine.,1393200000,,452,4.457831325301205

Usually when I do Denise's videos (which I do very often), I can do all the sessions without pause.  The exercises on this video are very challenging, especially with the added weights.  It was not aerobic but boy does it work those abs!!  I decided I would use this as an extension of some of the strictly aerobic videos, doing only 1 session at a time after an aerobic workout.  I may add that I am 62 years old but have exercised regularly through most of my life.  This video reminds me of Denise's Boot Camp Videos w/o the aerobics which I find to be her most challenging videos.

5087059,5,B007HOK77I,We love this ab workout - there are multiple types of workouts and the DVD allows you to customize what you want to do - and how much.  Denise's instruction is really good - lots of planks (ouch) - good balance of floor and standing exercises.  We purchased several different DVDs so we can change up our workout - this works great for us because we can do something different every day - never get bored.  That's a personal preference - but if you easily tire of a DVD - we recommend selecting 3-4 and use a different one each time.  Each DVD is like getting multiple/different workouts with the customization option (love this!).  This DVD is for anyone but the die-hard gym person.  Whether just starting out or consistently working out - this line is good and you'll feel it.,1367020800,3,779,4.48936170212766
5087060,5,B007HOK77I,"At first I thought a 15 min ab routine wouldn't be effective....especially with the types of exercises the cover described.  I do one workout a day, three days a week and I'm noticing results.  This weekend I did three days in a row and sometimes I had to take a break.  Overall I love that I added this to the end of my normal workouts and feel as though I will reach my fitness goal much faster now.  Thanks Denise!",1365897600,2,417,4.175
5087061,5,B007HOK77I,This DVD was recommended by Fitness magazine.  It didn't disappoint.  Buy it.  Use it.  You will get results.  Denise Austin is very upbeat throughout the routines.  You get three 15 minute workouts.  Burns1198 calories per 45 minute workout.,1365552000,,242,5.2105263157894735
5087062,4,B007HOK77I,What a workout! I will always love Denise Austin. She's a great motivator. The dvd arrived right on time. Can't wait to try it again.,1364169600,2,133,4.36
5087063,5,B007HOK77I,"There are 3 15 minute ab routines on this dvd, with the option to combine 2 or all 3 for a more intense workout. I have been following Denise Austin for years but only just recently got serious with improving my fitness. First of all, I love her voice and how pleasant she is! She doesn't have an annoying voice and does not look like a harlot. I find it very hard to follow a dvd in which the instructor looks like she is a stripper! Anywho, I've been alternating all 3 routines (one at a time) each day, 5 days a week. I am REALLY seeing results in my abs but also my back and posture as well. I don't get bored because I do a different one each day, and it's only 15 minutes long so I can do it when my kids nap in the morning. Even though each routine is only 15 minutes long, it really kicks my butt and produces real results. Love this dvd, and 2 of my friends are already asking to borrow it!",1363219200,13,899,3.972375690607735
5087064,3,B007HOK77I,Recommended by my niece.  Workout was good although I need an instructor that's not so wishy washy.  Don't need a drill sergeant but someone with some kind of motivation.  Better off doing workout without the sound and just play your own music to pump you up.,1363219200,,259,4.586956521739131
5087065,5,B007HOK77I,Was surprised at how effect this VCR was.  Would have liked it in DVD but reviewers suggested this was better since DVD format was different.  Highly recommend.  Short time big results.,1362960000,,185,4.903225806451613
5087066,5,B007HOK77I,"I really liked this dvd. I thought Denise cued very well. I think she cues better on dvds that have little to no cardio. This dvd does make you sweat but not a lot. However, that does not mean you didn't get a good workout. I did feel my abs being worked. I like that you can do one 15 minute segment or all three. Either way it time well spent.",1362355200,,345,3.8732394366197185
5087067,5,B007HOK77I,There are nice variations to classic abdominal moves and it is time efficient. Worth the money and not harsh on the neck muscles.,1361318400,,129,4.6521739130434785
5087068,4,B007HOK77I,I always get the most out of Denise Austion workout videos. I have been working out to her videos for 20 years now and I am always satisfied. The video is easy to follow and when I get done I feel like I have done a great workout,1361145600,,229,3.7916666666666665
5087069,4,B007HOK77I,"This DVD has three workouts for abs/core. Each workout is about 15 minutes, and for the most part will work you pretty well. There are some aerobic aspects to it, but I could feel it in the core areas the first couple of times I did it. Overall, I would recommend.",1360972800,,264,4.196078431372549
5087070,5,B007HOK77I,This is very effective with each move that works every abdominal muscle you have....and some you may not been aware you have!,1360972800,,125,4.7272727272727275
8516766,4,B007HOK77I,"I won't lie, Denise Austin is not my favorite workout video person.  She is almost far too nice and far to smiley for my taste.  But this is a decent workout and I can't argue that just because I have to turn away from the TV most of the time (and mute it once it is memorized).

As usual, Denise does a great job of transitioning you from move to move and explaining what needs to be done.  The workouts are short and complete and can be done in any order (there are 3 different workouts on the video) depending on what you prefer.  Recommended for anyone looking to get a nice workout at home with an insanely nice instructor (give me Jillian any day).",1525392000,,654,4.2

After each work out you feel great not to over worked so you can keep going on with your day, they are really good the the busy life style.

8516774,5,B007HOK77I,"I've done them all!  I've tried every trainer, and every workout, and I do like Jillian, and others, but Denise Austin is simply the best!  She is the one I keep coming back to.  Her style is one of the main reasons...I prefer her kind voice and gentle encouragement throughout a tough workout over a trainer barking at me which only makes the workout seem even harder.  Denise's smile and joyous demeanor go a long way to help you get through the tough (and always effective!) workouts.  She keeps it moving which is so important because if there is too much pause and chatter between exercises, the thought of quitting enters my mind.  With Denise, the workouts always go fast.",1475712000,,679,4.616666666666666
