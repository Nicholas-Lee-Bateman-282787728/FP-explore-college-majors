2922196,5,B000UJBYBK,"My kids play chess, and this movie was really good. I miss those Saturday (or Sunday) night specials at night with the famiy when I was a kid. This would be a perfect movie that type or any type of night.",1217721600,,204,4.0
2922197,5,B000UJBYBK,The character was something totally different for Ted Danson.  Not the macho bachelor type that I've always seen him play..  Definitely the right man for the part.  Very moving role....,1213315200,,185,5.1
2922198,5,B000UJBYBK,"In many ways this is a predictable movie - the long shot underdogs come out on top after a lot of hard work, discipline and devotion to following the rules.  Still, it is a very satisfying movie, especially knowing that it is based on a real group of South Bronx grade school kids.  On the other hand, if after watching the movie you learn that the kids are still losers, you would feel cheated, so being predictable isn't really that bad.

The unusual quality of the movie is that it is focused on chess, somewhat unusual for a movie.  [See also the Wonderworks program, 'The Mighty Pawns,' 'The Luzhin Defence,' and the comedy, 'Hatley High,']  We graded the movie down slightly because there are a few swear words, once by the teacher, but otherwise only from the junkies and losers with whom the kids have to deal.  If you like chess, you'll probably like this movie.  Even if you don't understand chess, you'll be glad you watched it, especially when reading the things the kids wrote about how chess changed their lives.",1212883200,2,1026,4.604395604395604
2922199,5,B000UJBYBK,It's a good story on how a group of kids became enriched by entering the world of chess.,1212192000,,88,3.9444444444444446
2922200,4,B000UJBYBK,"Ted Danson is at his best in this movie about a famous chess teacher. He takes a class room of kids that haven't got a clue about what education do for them and transforms their thinking and gives them ideas about the future! The typical stereo -type antagonist is the whites or well to do that think they are unstoppable in the chess tournaments. It is an excellent feel good movie I can recommend to all. There is a little bit of bad language, especially the drug addict mother.",1205280000,7,480,4.404494382022472
2922201,5,B000UJBYBK,The movie is excellent. The language is family oriented-the story is well written- I was in the field of elementary education as a teacher and an elementary school principal in a big urban area and I think it could be used to encourage kids to succeed in life.,1203984000,4,260,4.4375
2922202,4,B000UJBYBK,"The movie was great.  I enjoyed it.  The child actors are good, and Ted Danson is just excellent.  By and large, the actors, the storyline, and the chess seem credible, realistic and on target.  As a chess player, I could see that the chess teaching techniques used are textbook, so there is nothing fake or phony about this story.

I'm a believer in the main message of the movie, that I chess is able to boost a child academically, and that...""chess is a battle of the mind....it does not care who you are, what color you are, or where you come from...""

Having just taught my 5 year old daughter how to play chess, I find that  the grittiness of the South Bronx depicted in the film, and the bad language used is too much for my daughter's view right now.  This is a pity, but the producers and directors are ""keeping it real"".  I respect that but I wish that they came out with a more family friendly version with over-dubbing of the language.

The last scene in the movie showing the animated ninjas on the board was a little hokey and unnecessary.",1201305600,14,1053,4.381443298969073
2922203,5,B000UJBYBK,"This was a very touching movie,...the only thing i didn't like was the typical story of inner city kids being taught by upper middle class gentleman and making a difference in their lives....etc...

However the story is still very touching and the characters in this film really grip you.  Especially Dawson, great family movie...plus I am a chess player and I learned a few things.",1200355200,3,382,4.861538461538461
2922204,5,B000UJBYBK,True  Story!,1423440000,,12,5.0
2922205,5,B000UJBYBK,great movie that I have shared with friends,1415318400,,43,4.5
2922206,4,B000UJBYBK,"A great movie excellent role for Ted Danson. Always nice to see the well off doing something for the down trodden, but talented young people. Excellent true story I understand. Always enjoy movies based on true stories.
Very disappointed no English Subtitles.",1411516800,,259,5.190476190476191
2922207,5,B000UJBYBK,Love this movie. Can watch it over & over . I like the true life stories,1411516800,,72,3.5625
2922208,5,B000UJBYBK,I think this a wonderful movie to share with children to encourage them and let them know that your environment does not determine who you are or who you can become.,1410134400,,165,4.354838709677419
2922209,5,B000UJBYBK,I saw this movie and thought of my seven year old grandson who loves chess. I had to buy it for him and he loved it.,1395792000,,116,3.5
2922210,5,B000UJBYBK,The chess team I coach watch this every year as we prepare for competition.  Very inspiring movie for upper elementary and middle school students who love chess!,1390089600,,161,4.962962962962963
2922211,5,B000UJBYBK,"I would use this film during transition periods in my classroom, like at the end of the semester, before a holiday break, before beginning another novel, etc.  I always had students answer questions and/or complete a movie review so I was able to tie it into the curriculum easily.",1389398400,,281,4.73469387755102
2922212,3,B000UJBYBK,"This movie was very so so. It is a far cry from ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"". Not bad, just not great.",1389139200,,103,3.9523809523809526
2922213,5,B000UJBYBK,"Love this movie! Great movie to watch with your kids, very inspiring! I'm glad I purchased it, would be a great gift.",1387238400,,117,4.363636363636363
2922214,5,B000UJBYBK,This Movie shows that Kids just need someone that cares and they will perform.  Just give them a chance and they can perform.,1373068800,,125,4.434782608695652
2922215,5,B000UJBYBK,"An inspiring movie based on a true story about kids who learn to believe in themselves when someone cares enough to help them. Using chess as a way to teach self reliance and self control, a teacher finds meaning in his own life as well as saving his students from lives of meaningless mediocrity or worse. It's about making a difference; the thing that all teachers hope for, and what keeps them in an often otherwise frustrating occupation. Kids like the movie too, but I don't think they fully get the transformation that's going on. (I work with 2nd through 5th grade students teaching chess after school).",1369440000,,610,4.710280373831775
2922216,5,B000UJBYBK,What a GREAT MOVIE  never much watched TED Danson much on tv. but he really gave a star performance. aaaaand the kids did really great liked the pre-schooler the best. I like true stories the best  and what they achived is amazing. Would tell all my friends and neibhor to veiw it,1366156800,,280,4.365384615384615
2922217,4,B000UJBYBK,A good DVD and every parent of young children should get and watch it and then show to your children. Great for school teachers too asit could be of assistance to you in helping to understand the needs of your students,1364947200,,218,4.341463414634147
2922218,3,B000UJBYBK,"Entertaining movie with decent plot and acting. While predictible, the story is enjoyable and actors perform well enough. Fans of Ted Danson will enjoy him in this role.",1360454400,,169,5.071428571428571
2922219,5,B000UJBYBK,I use movies to inspire my students to play and learn Chess and that is exactly what this movies does.,1359504000,,102,4.15
2922220,5,B000UJBYBK,It's not often to find a family friendly movie with some meaningful themes.  It created some discussion and some processing while adding laughter to the evening.,1359331200,,161,5.1923076923076925
2922221,3,B000UJBYBK,NO SUBTITLE AT ALL. WHY? YOU KNOW THAT IT IS LAW UNDER AMERICA DIABLITY ACT! YOU SAY THAT I KEEP IT ON YOU BUT HOW CAN I KEEP IT WITHOUT ANY SUBTITLE?,1357776000,,150,3.71875
2922222,5,B000UJBYBK,"Must see movie for all chess players, because it's based on a true story.  After viewing everyone should start play chess.",1356307200,,122,4.809523809523809
2922223,5,B000UJBYBK,On time and at a great price. I do not know how they can geat things like this so cheap.,1356220800,,88,3.45
2922224,5,B000UJBYBK,"This is one of a group of films and I can't name them all, but what comes to mind is Music From The Heart, Take The Lead, The Debaters and the list can go on.  It shows how one or even a few people can make a difference in the lives of those who are not only less fortunate but living in dangerous situations.  This is the case of the fourth grade kids in the class of Richard Mason, a former corporate engineer, and chess champion.  He teaches them to appreciate the game by comparing it to a battle, which a lot of them are already used to, like the kid, Jimmy who is always getting beaten up by some teenage thugs.  Not only do the fourth graders as well as the kindergartner, brother of Renee, Dawson become proficient at the game, their school performance also improves.  So much for following lesson plans, finally the principal actually gets it and becomes supportive of this group of kids that go on to chess tournaments and eventually win the support of people outside of the school district.  Makes you wish there were more Richard Masons around, because this is in fact, a true story!",1350518400,,1095,4.396039603960396
2922225,4,B000UJBYBK,"Well, I liked the movie.  I don't want to ruin the movie for you folks, but I found it to be light-hearted (it did have some more serious scenes, but overall, it was enjoyable), yet profound.  In case you're wondering why I gave it only four stars, not five, I must say that it was enjoyable, but perhaps not enough to watch over and over again.  I might watch it again in five years or so...

I would recommend that small kids watch this with a responsible adult only...there is nothing obscene, but there is some mild violence (not ""kidding around"" stuff such as in cartoons).  They might have questions, and I would hope an adult would answer as frankly as is reasonable...

Thanks for reading this.  I hope you enjoy this movie (and other movies about chess).",1347494400,2,763,4.4855072463768115
2922226,5,B000UJBYBK,"""I have not seen a touching movie like this in a long time....it made our 9 year old twin boys want to learn how to Play chess!!! Awesome!!!!""",1344124800,,142,4.107142857142857

2922228,5,B000UJBYBK,This is a great movie for people of all ages. A great movie to inspire young people about the world of chess and about life. I would highly recommend this movie as an X-mas gift.,1323302400,,178,4.114285714285714
2922229,3,B000UJBYBK,"The film is okay but having seen other films with similar themes, I hoped for more. Perhaps that isn't fair. Watching this movie is the first I ever heard about the Knights of the South Bronx. It has its fun moments but for me, it isn't a memorable film. The price was right, though!",1315526400,,283,4.2592592592592595
2922230,4,B000UJBYBK,"An outstanding movie -- good cast, plot, heartwarming.
  Shows the value of chess to help children use their mind and to develop patience.
  I have chess students and the teacher's comments helped motivate children to play
chess.
  A film worth seeing several times.
  Don't miss seeing this movie.",1292544000,,298,5.0625
2922231,5,B000UJBYBK,"I first saw this movied on TV and, for a while had a hard time finding it. I'm so glad I did. The film,based on a true story,tells about some inner city kids who, with the help of a new substitute teacher, (Ted Dansen),learn to play chess so well that they eventually beat the competition right up to the nationals. The kids in the movie are fun to watch and since our grandkids((8) & (10) are novice chess players, ""Knights"", has become a family favorite.",1263427200,,456,4.376470588235295
2922232,5,B000UJBYBK,"A very moving story of how chess can create a solid foundation of organizing scattered thoughts of fears and doubts, and refocus them into concrete ways of thinking. I cheered for the kids as I watched them go thru a new and exciting way of thinking their way thru the battlefield of drugs, gangs, beatings and doubt. Ted Danzen is excellent and portrays a wonderful character who lives chess, loves chess and infuses this into the children in such a beautiful way, that you will want to do the same for your kids...simply marvelous....",1244764800,,536,4.712765957446808
2922233,5,B000UJBYBK,"The film begins with former engineer businessman Richard Mason (Danson) showing up at an inner-city school for what he thought was to be his first day teaching sixth grade. It turns out to be fourth grade and they're not very interested in learning. Based on true events, Mason, a chess master, finds common ground with the students in teaching them the game of chess in a way that challenges and motivates them to want to be the best. Mason, dealing with his own demons at home, finds a new life in the classroom and so do the students. While the plot and ending may be somewhat predictable, the film feels true and realistic. There is always room for one more well done story of someone who thinks outside the box to change their world and those around them for good. May their tribe increase! Very entertaining and family friendly. [...]",1233360000,,840,4.6066666666666665

8213490,5,B000UJBYBK,"Kids learn is so many different ways. Who would think that ""chess"" would help kids understand math, English, and history and all the rest. We need more teachers who would make learning more rewarding like this book tells can happen.",1505520000,,232,4.825
