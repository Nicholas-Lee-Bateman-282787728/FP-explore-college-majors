8223139,2,B000WFYXCO,"This film is a low-budgeted vampire film set in modern times. It's directed by the same old guy who stars as a vampire hunter who, living a personal fantasy, no doubt gets to have the girl in the end. In fact there's quite a few old men in this film who get to star opposite topless girls, probably friends of his.

The plot is really weak. A vampire, being hunted is wounded, and makes off down the interstate and takes ""Exit 38"" (get the reference?) and he ends up in a strip-club, feeds on a girl, kills the manager and takes over.

One stripper, talking to two new girls says ""Isn't it strange how all the girls keep disappearing"" (strange then that she would hang around herself). She adds ""No girl who's had a one-on-one interview with the boss every returns"". Spooky! Weird then that no one's gone to the police over this.",1216252800,,829,4.411764705882353
