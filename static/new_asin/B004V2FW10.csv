8442702,5,B004V2FW10,"Chailla Babu released in 1977 was a runaway hit. It starred Super Star Rajesh Khanna and Zeenat Aman in the lead. This action movie must be watched carefully else one would lose track. The movie has good music by Laxmikant Pyarelal and some numbers were very popular then and still are. Rajesh Khanna is good in the movie and is in various characters all rolled into one. He looks great in action scenes also. Zeenat Aman looks good and performs well. This is a revenge drama told in a different style but as suggested if one is not careful - he would not understand. It is of course a must watch for Rajesh Khanna fans as he shows his skills in all - action, comedy, romance and drama.",1305676800,,686,4.3671875
