1665069,5,B00005U8Q7,"Well since I love horror and especially Stephen King, this collection is great!!!

I love all the movies in it and can't wait to collect more!!

I have 13 Stephen King movies so far....",1153785600,,185,4.411764705882353
1665070,5,B00005U8Q7,IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL NIGHT FOR OUR FAMILY. WE HAD READ THE BOOKS AND THE WAY THEY WERE REPRESENTED IN MOVIE FORM WAS EXCEPTIONAL. I WOULD ADVISE A VIEWING OF THESE MOVIES TO EVERYONE.,1152403200,,184,4.285714285714286
1665071,4,B00005U8Q7,"First of all, if you don't like long movies steer clear of this set.  With the exception of Thinner and Cujo these movies are 4 hours long and up.  As far as the contents, this box set has some great movies, Cujo is a classic horror film that caused me to have a phobia of dogs when I was little. The Stand is one of the best (and longest) movies I have ever seen, a classic good vs evil or even the disciples vs Satan.  And then there is the Langoliers, a movie that understandably gets different review but I though was brilliant and very well casted.  Along these three excellent movies there is Thinner which isn't a bad movie but it's nothing exceptional either, and The Golden Years which is a long long boaring piece of garbage.  I have yet to make it through the Golden Years in one sitting without falling asleep so I have no idea how it ends but from other reviews it's just as bad as the rest of the movie.  For the money this is a solid buy, especially if you are a Stephen King fan as I am.  I do want to know when will the put some of his other great movies in one package.  Movies like Needful Things, The Tommyknockers, Storm of the Century, and It?  Just a thought!",1128297600,5,1182,4.149122807017544
1665072,4,B00005U8Q7,"IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THESE MADE FOR TV ADAPTATIONS OF STEPHEN KING'S GREAT BOOKS.  GOLDEN YEARS ENDING WAS A BIT WEAK, BUT THE NUMBER OF DVD'S FOR THE PRICE MAKES THIS A GREAT DEAL",1124496000,,179,4.114285714285714
1665073,3,B00005U8Q7,"It's sad how many times true Stephen King fans will have to purchase his movies. He has so many, yet they put out a two volume set -- cleary there will be a 'complete' collection eventually. Cujo is cult-classic -- The Langoliers is an acquired taste, I found it great. The Stand is really a gem --  (that and The Langoliers) -- brilliantly directed, well casted and phenomonal. Thinner is an okay movie, nothing all too special, but still worth owning. Now, Golden Years, is what I found to be disappointed in. The movie is just boring -- a man races against time to find out how to stop from getting younger? All in all, if you're an avid King reader and movie collector, I'd pick it up -- if not, just rent the movies indivigually.",1078704000,6,734,4.397058823529412
1665074,3,B00005U8Q7,"""The Langoliers"" is great and ""The Stand"" is monumental. If ""Cujo"" is an acquired taste, I have not acquired it. ""Golden Years"" starts out all right and has its moments but peters out to nothing at the end. I haven't yet watched ""Thinner.""",1059264000,,239,4.5813953488372094
1665075,2,B00005U8Q7,"Two stars for the complete collection.  One of Stephen King's better mini-series in ""The Stand"" is mixed with some less than stellar efforts in the King department.  I truly enjoyed ""Cujo"" (despite a specific deviation from the book that actually made a better movie) but cannot say the same for ""The Langoliers"" and especially the ""Golden Years.""  ""Thinner"" is in the middling range of King adaptations.  For me, it would have been better to purchase ""The Stand"" and ""Cujo"" alone.  For King completists however, this might be the way to go.",1054166400,7,541,4.9010989010989015
1665076,3,B00005U8Q7,"Cujo-It's been a long time since I've seen this film, but to my memory, it was a pretty decent horror flick about a rabid St. Bernard.  ** 1/2 out of ***** (Based on 7-year old memory)
The Stand-Completely compelling horror epic about the end of the world and the survivors dealing with the aftermath.  At 6 hrs., it's LONG but never dull.  Somewhat lackluster ending, though.  Great performances from Gary Sinise, Miguel Ferrer, Rob Lowe, and Jamey Sheriday, and a fine score from W.G. Snuffy Walden. **** out of *****
The Langoliers-Intriguing and engrossing thriller about a group of people who awaken during a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Boston only to discover all of the other passengers and the flight crew have disappeared.  Despite a couple of weak special effects and an underwhelming final scene, this is a true seat gripper that proves fear of the unknown is more frightening than any monster.  Good performances from most of the cast, especially David Morse, Dean Stockwell, and Mark Lindsay Chapman.
**** out of *****
Thinner-Another Stephen King horror film about a man who is cursed by a gypsy and continues to grow thinner.  Initially intriguing premise really goes nowhere after awhile, and it's hard to tell whether the ending is being serious or jokey.  * 1/2 out of *****
Golden Years-Absolutely awful mini-series involving an old man who begins to grow younger after a disaster in a secret laboratory.  Pedestrian direction, second-rate performances, poor dialogue, and an astonishingly bad ending are the main highlights.  Some die-hard Stephen King fans might find something to admire, but it's a torturous 4 hours.  1/2 out of *****
This 5-pack DVD would a worthy buy for those who are intrigued and haven't seen these films yet.  The Stand and The Langoliers are clearly the best, and they also remain among King's best film adaptations to date.",1013385600,28,1878,4.964856230031949

7954531,4,B00005U8Q7,"This is a great collection for any Stephen King fan.

Although I enjoyed ""Golden Years"", I would have liked it extended. The plot and character development have all the potential to have been made into a two series tv program. That was the only thing stopping me from giving it five stars.",1185667200,,289,4.5576923076923075
7954532,3,B00005U8Q7,"Here are my thoughts on this DVD collection. Cujo and The Stand are great movies. Thinner and Golden years suck big time. The Langoliers would be great if only it were rereleased with some better special effects (primarily the CGI needs much work). All in all, not a bad collection, but only two out of five movies in the pack are worth keeping. However this is just my point of view, if you like the films in this collection, I would recomend it to you. After all, everyone is different, right. Well, thats my review.",1155081600,3,518,4.463157894736842
