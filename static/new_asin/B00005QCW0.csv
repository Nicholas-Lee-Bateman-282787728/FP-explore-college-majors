1647918,5,B00005QCW0,"I didn't really like the Ranma 1/2 OVAs and movies that I seen, but I decided to give the TV series a try anyway. I'm glad I did, because this is great. The video is good for a TV series, and both the English and Japanese voice actors are great. For once, I didn't mind watching the dub. The menu loads quickly, and it has some very good animation. The only problem with the set is that Pioneer didn't strain themselves thinking up extras. All it contains is creditless openings and endings. Oh well, at least the songs are subtitled, and the episode previews were left in.
This is the first season of Ranma 1/2. It contains 18 half-hour episodes, of which 1 consists mostly of clips from earlier episodes. However, the other 17 are excellent. Please note that it's four discs, not five. Also, the box says that it is region 1 encoded, not `ALL'.
Ranma and his father travel to china to train in the martial arts. While there, they are cursed. From now on, whenever cold water is tossed on them, Ranma will turn into a girl, and his father will turn into a panda. This causes problems because Ranma is engaged to marry another girl! A host of other characters soon show up to kill and/or marry Ranma. The plot is too complex to really explain, but sufficient to say, the series involves a lot of martial arts fights and romantic comedy. It's defiantly worth a look.",1007769600,8,1365,4.442231075697211
1647919,5,B00005QCW0,"Ranma and his pop go to China, to train at some springs his father heard about.  But if you are a fan of Ranma 1/2, you already know that and KNOW what happens.  If you are not a fan, but wish to become one, BUY this collection.  It follows the manga (not each and every story arch, but most of it) and this means it starts right from the beginning, so you get to see how Ranma and Akane first met.  You don't need background or flashbacks to understand it because THESE DVDs ARE the background and flashbacks!  We meet the Black Rose (and her lovely laugh), P-chan, Shampoo, and many others.
My only problem is there are very few extras.  In fact, all they have in the extras are the songs WITHOUT the credits shown over them. I would of liked more.
If you liked Ranma 1/2, I would suggest other Anime, such as Tenchi Muyo! and Oh My Goddess!  They are available and have lots of extras.
For example, the 'Oh My Goddess'(Volume One), has more extras then episodes!",1007337600,,965,4.298342541436464

Its hilarious and shows how the whole thing happened, which is important if you really want to understand it, trust me, buy it!

The story of Ranma is truly a unique one, and if you have read the editor's reviews and been on the web at all you should have a pretty good idea of what this series is about.  If you have never seen it before, do whatever you need to do in order to do so, trust me, you will be happy you did!",1006560000,,516,3.7685185185185186
1647922,5,B00005QCW0,"For instant comedy, just add water. Billed as a ""martial arts sex comedy"", Ranma 1/2 is the story of a boy named Ranma who fell under a bizarre curse, and turns into a girl when he is splashed with cold water.
It's the story of Ranma's engagement to Akane Tendo, a tomboyish girl who professes a hatred for boys. It's a story about the rivals for Akane's heart, the dimwitted swordmaster Kuno and the directionally challenged Ryoga, who suffers his own bizarre curse (he turns into Akane's pet pig, P-chan, when doused with cold water).
It's also the story of the rivals for Ranma's heart, the deranged Kodachi, sister of Kuno, and the Chinese Amazon warrior Shampoo, who will do anything to win her man.
Love Triange? We're talking decahedron, baby!
Ranma 1/2 is a story about love, martial arts, and weird water curses. It's the story of family (and you've never seen one like this before).
Ranma 1/2. Love hurts. Alot.
Lovingly preserved on DVD, Ranma 1/2 is one series that desrves royal treatment.
Trust me, you'll be hooked by the opening song.",1004400000,6,1050,4.711956521739131
1647923,5,B00005QCW0,"Well to be honest, I've only seen these episodes on VHS, but I own several other Ranma DVDs and they are all high- quality disks.  The story is a little complicated, but that's what makes this series so much fun.  It's about a boy, Ranma, who is engaged to a girl, Akane.  These two aren't that crazy about eachother at first.  To complicate matters, several boys compete for Akane's affection and several girls are after Ranma's heart.  To further complicate matters, Ranma changes into a girl when he is wet.  There's so much going on with each of the characters in Ranma 1/2, it would be hard to explain in less than 1000 words.  If you like martial arts, goofy anime, and love triangles that involve gender switching, then pick up this set.  The animation isn't outstanding in the first few tv episodes, but the OVA episodes are incredible- I also reccommend that box set.",1003190400,3,876,4.606451612903226

1647925,5,B00005QCW0,Finaly the first season of Ranma on DVD.Ranma 1/2 is based on the manga by the great Ruminko Takahashi and is the story of a boy who turns into a girl with cold water. This series is great and full of colorful characters. This is another series that is more fun then it should be.

1647926,5,B00005QCW0,"I like Ranma 1/2.  It's actually one of the first animes I watched.  This DVD set cover the first two volumes of the manga (Ranma and Akene's first meeting and meeting Shampoo).  However, it does not follow the order of the manga.  (The skating arc comes is in the 2nd set).  I think this anime has aged pretty well since the episodes still make me laugh.  I recommend it if you can find this set.  It seems like Ranma 1/s is hard to find these days",1379894400,,449,4.151162790697675

1647928,5,B00005QCW0,"Ranma Saotome and his Father have returned from training in China. Unfortunately, they were cursed when they were there. When doused with cold water Ranma turns into a girl. When doused with cold water his Father turns into a Panda. Ranma is engaged to a girl named Akane Tendo. Akane and Ranma's parents arranged this marriage, and neither of them are too happy about it. Now they have to live together and try to get along, b/c they are gonna be together from now on. Not only do they not get along, there are tons of classmates that are in love with Akane, Ranma, and girl Ranma. Their lives are way too complicated, goofy, and violent.

I've been watching anime for a long time and I own over 300 titles, but amazingly enough this is the first time I've seen Ranma 1/2. I was hooked before the 1st episode was over. This anime has everything. Action, drama, comedy, and romance all abound in this series. For the late 80's, the animation and voice acting is very good. It also has a pretty good soundtrack. It's definitely not a kids show. There is a healthy amount of nudity and suggestive situations in Ranma 1/2. So if that stuff bothers you, avoid it. I'm always a bit weary of getting older anime. I guess I've gotten spoiled with the awesome animation and voice acting that has become more prominent since the 2000's began. Surprisingly, the story is so much fun that I haven't given it a 2nd thought. I strongly recommend this series to any anime fan over the age of 15.",1359504000,,1481,4.485185185185185
1647929,5,B00005QCW0,"Ranma 1/2 is a story about a 16 year old boy who, when doused with cold water, turns into a pretty girl who still has a mind of a boy.  He turns back into a boy when he get's doused in hot water.  This is a funny and crazy series with some anime nudity.  I highly recomend the entire series.  The animation is good, the english voice actors are absolutely right on, and the stories are great fun.  You may still be able to find the manga or anime at your local library.  If not, then this series is worth the price.  Each of the seven seasons has between 18-24 episodes.  There is also a post season 7, 12 episode series and two movies which conclude the story.  The 2nd movie: ""Nihao My Concubine"" is excellent and rather eye popping.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ranma-1-2-The-Movie-2-Nihao-My-Concubine/dp/6305103429/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ranma 1/2 - The Movie 2, Nihao My Concubine</a>
 It's seems like the $36 season boxed sets are being phased out, which is a shame, so get them while you can.  You don't need to start with season 1 to get hooked on this silly but addictive series.

1647936,5,B00005QCW0,"I deiceded to get the first seson of Ranma 1/2 after reading the first tankoban. While I'm only halfway through the boxset, the tv version sticks pretty much to the manga. While most of my anime puches are on dvd, this is a great value considering the back in the 90's you got only a pair of episiodes for the price of this boxset.",1281657600,,331,4.1875
1647937,4,B00005QCW0,"Ranma 1/2 is very well-known among the community of anime fans, particularly in North America. Its manga has sold very well, and the TV Series adheres to much of that. The story centers around Ranma Saotome, a hot-tempered martial artist who finds himself cursed after falling into a hot spring in China. His curse is that whenever cold water touches him, he turns into a girl equivalent of himself (and returns to normal with hot water contact). As if that weren't troublesome enough, he finds himself engaged to Akane Tendo of the Tendo Dojo, where he makes his new home for the entire run of the series. And to top it all off, his unscrupulous father has engaged him to multiple families, usually for mundane reasons like short-term food and money. Hijinks ensue.

The First Season really sets the tone for Ranma 1/2 as a whole, although not all the characters have been introduced by the time of its completion. First, there is the tension between Ranma and Akane. Ranma is hot-tempered, with a macho-sexist view of women due to his lack of experience with them (he spent most of his childhood with his father on a martial arts training trip), and Akane is both hot-tempered, extremely violent, and yet extremely jealous after a certain point in the series. This leads to a succession of misunderstandings and ""foot-in-mouth"" situations, and the dynamic continues right up to the end of the series.

Second, there is the ""other fiancee"" situation. One of Ranma's many fiancees shows up in Disc Four, and Ranma quickly develops several rivals that dog him for the entire season. Much of the story is often centered around the attempts by these rivals to find a new way to defeat Ranma.

Third, there is a great deal of soft-core female nudity in the anime. No genitalia, but you get frequent shots of teenage girls' breasts, particularly those of female Ranma, as well as occasionally buttocks shots. This did not bother me, but it might be more problematic for some younger viewers whose parents disapprove of this.

Fourth, and very importantly, Ranma is a HIGHLY episodic show and series. This means that most of the show consists of ""one-time"" plots that end with the episode, and there is little indication of progression in time within the series other than the appearance of some new characters, and Ranma's acquisition of some new techniques. There are four larger story arcs that appear in the series, but none of these constitute even a significant fraction of the overall series, and none of them are in the first volume.

If you find this humorous (and the series often is quite amusing), I strongly suggest you buy this.",1243900800,2,2636,4.810154525386314
1647938,5,B00005QCW0,In my opinion this and season 2 are the best seasons of Ranma 1/2. I first watched this series when I was much younger and its still something I can put in the DVD player and watch some 10 years later. Nostalgia for once hasn't failed me.,1215907200,,238,4.085106382978723
1647939,4,B00005QCW0,"This box set contains the first eighteen episodes of the classic anime series, Ranma 1/2.  There's very little in the way of special features in the set (there's textless versions of the opening and the three ending sequences, and there's also the English credits).

Although this is a rather ""no-frills"" DVD set, the series itself is quite enjoyable.  Normally, I would say the price of this set is a bit high for such a ""no-frills"" set, but the episodes in and of themselves are worth the cost of the set, especially when you factor in how old the property is now.",1213747200,,566,4.584158415841584

1647941,5,B00005QCW0,"This was the first Manga I ever read and I fell in love with it so many years ago. I finally got the dvd and I LOVE it. First off I think it's hilarious that when Genma Saotome (Ranma's father) turns into a Giant panda when doused with cold water goes about the town doing odd jobs and running with a pot of hot water and that no one really seems to notice, and if they do they just give him strange looks and go on about what they were doing. When Ranma comes into contact with cold water he turns into a sexy red head girl. Akane and Ranma are engaged and seem to ""hate"" each other. Everyday there is some predicament the two seem to get into. It's funny and really keeps me entertained. They are some nudity shots so if you aren't looking for that, look else where. =] I highly recommend this!",1204761600,,796,4.108974358974359
1647942,5,B00005QCW0,"Rumiko Takahashi has created a fine series. She tells the stories of her beloved characters in detail. One example is how Ranma got his ""curse"" during a training exercise in China. Every episode has martial arts and comedy. Some episodes even have romance in a one-sided view.
  Other characters join the cast as they are introduced into the series. They all have some connection to Ranma. There is one character who wants to kill Ranma and marry him at the same time.
  By having to change into a girl, Ranma is presented with many challenges. At other times, it allows him to get free food. Ranma is plagued with suitors of both sexes.
  This series is rated T+ for Nudity and Sexual Content. Parantal Guidance is suggested.",1199664000,,726,4.677165354330708
1647943,5,B00005QCW0,"Those of you who know me, or have read my many reviews online know that I'm not a fan of your typical BESM syndrome that is prevalent in Japanese anime.

It stands for Big Eye Small Mouth.

Most of the time I can't stand it, and I won't watch it. Because of this, I avoid most anime like the plague. There are a few shows that I've been able to watch, because it strays from this archetypical style of animation. Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed and Blood the last vampire are just a couple of examples of what I can watch.

However, I can be swayed occasionally. Especially when it comes to something that can make me laugh.

Many years ago, when I was still in highschool, I got out of reading the average comic and started to read many different independent titles. I found that most comics back then were nothing more than silly super-powered soap operas.

Now, you might be asking yourself, what the heck does this have to do with an anime review?

Well, because of getting into independent comics, I discovered manga - Japanese comics.

I read quite a few different titles back then, and I clearly remember the owner of the shop that I bought the titles form handing me the first couple of issues of Ranma . I flipped through it and gave him a dirty look and asked him why he gave me something that was, after my initial look, a Japanese romance comic?

He said just read it. If I didn't like it, I could bring it back. If I did like it, pay for it and keep reading the series.

Well, it turned out that yes, there was romance involved, but it was mainly about a young martial artist who just happened to fall (literally) into a very strange and disconcerting curse.

Two things about the comic that caused me to start reading it. First and foremost, it made me laugh. Very few comics ever managed to do that.

Secondly, it had nudity in it.

Before you start shaking your head, remember, this was almost twenty years ago. I was barely out of my teens and that sort of thing still held my interest. And besides, I wasn't married at the time.

Anyhow - after I did get married, I ended up dropping comics altogether. Hey, being a newlywed is rather hard on your solvent cash. I just didn't have the money to spare.

Years later, I was, out of pure curiosity, skimming through the anime rack at the local game store, and I noticed that they had Ranma  on DVD. I grabbed the box and noticed that it was the first season of the series - 18 episodes in total. And, hey, the price was more than reasonable - it was only $45 Canadian for the entire season.

So, despite the dislike I have for anime in general, I purchased it and over a period of a couple of weeks, my family and I watched the first season.

The same humour, and yes, the same nudity that I remember was still there. It made all of us laugh and laugh quite hard at some scenes.

One thing that also attracted me to the series was the eclectic group of characters. Ranma, the title character is a devoted martial artist who is damned good at what he does. His father is also a devoted martial artist although he can be very pig headed and tends to spend most of his free time as a Panda.

No, I'm not kidding.

That's not the only thing. There are several different characters, most of which have a grudge against Ranma for various reasons. A former fellow student named Ryoga Hibiki with the world's worst sense of direction, a hot little Chinese Amazon girl who wants to kill the girl Ranma, but is madly in love with boy Ranma.

There are the three sisters, of which Ranma finds himself betrothed to the youngest, Akane Tendo. Each one has her own unique personality.

Then we have several other Characters that interact on a regular basis with Ranma and his family.

Now, the season begins with Ranma and his father showing up at the Tendo anything goes school of martial arts, where Ranma is betrothed to Akane. That's when the fun starts.

Throughout the year, after he's enrolled in the same school as Akane, he discovers her morning ritual of combat to fend of would be suitors. He encounters a rival for Akane's hand named Tatewaki Kuno, who promptly falls in love with the girl Ranma.

Later Ranma encounters Kuno's sister, who loves the boy Ranma.

During this time, he also has to deal with the money grubbing schemes of Nabiki Tendo, a brilliant but oft scattered brained doctor named Tofu Ono, challenges to fights to the death, and even a Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics challenge.

Even the back stories to the various characters and his travels in China are very entertaining to watch, and once again, it made me laugh out loud many times.

I enjoyed it because of this, and because of the memories it brought back for me. I enjoyed it so much that when I was on the last disk of the first season, I had to go out and purchase the second season.

If you're a fan of anime, it's a no brainer. Even if you're not a fan of anime, it's worth watching just for the characters and the strange situations that make you laugh.

Blocking most of Ranma walking across the screen with big fat letters? Thats a little annoying. I know that you can still watch the textless opening and closing as a special feature but since most of the time you're watching the episodes themselves, it would've been nice for the credits to have been placed more carefully for all the episode intros, instead of having the text interfering with the characters and ruining the enjoyment of watching the intros before each episode.

In case you don't somehow know about this anime, it's about a martial artist, (Ranma Saotome) and his unfortunate luck in having the ability to change into a female when struck by even the tiniest of cold water. (You'll be many classic moments when just when you think it couldn't happen, it does). Genma, Ranma's father seeks to have his son wed one of Soun Tendo(u)'s beautiful daughters, so he can carry on the Anything-Goes Martial Arts School. Akane is pretty much chosen by her other sisters because of her tomboy nature and her extreme hatred towards boys. Along the way, Ranma meets up with many other interesting characters, including Kuno, the indecisive upperclassman, Ryoga, his arch-rival, and eventually, even Shampoo, the barbaric amazon girl from China.

Nex to the OVA series, Season 1 is considered by many to be a excellent starting point for the 7 season Ranma 1/2 series. Season 1 is 18 episodes long, with each show clocking in anywhere from 20 to 25 minutes. This set will be presented in the original Japanese version (with English subtitles), and by the English cast as well. Overall, both versions are great in my honest opinion (of course, the original is superior).

For Ranma veterans and those that have been swayed by the previous release of this season and its enormous price tag. The question that might be on everyone's mind right now is, how can Viz offer this set so cheaply now in comparison to before? In my next paragraph, I'm going to attempt to take a stab at this perplexed thought.

Recently, many classic anime series (and new ones) have been released in what is called a ""thin-pak"". Basically all DVDs are in a very thin opening in the contents of the DVD Set. What this does is decrease the overall price, thanks to less packaging. However, sometimes with new releases, extras are often left out that were once included with the original. Postcards, opening/closing scenes with subtitles and no subtitles, previews of other animes, encyclopedia of the anime, etc.) I would assume that we'll be getting the anime and just the anime, but I could very well be wrong. For most of us anime fans, getting the animes we love as a drastically reduced price is often worth it in the end.

Make no mistake, I am simply guessing at this because of experiences with past anime sets. (Take the Anime Legends series of Love Hina, Escaflowne, etc, remember when those sets often reached into the hundreds of dollars?)

Another important thing to worry is, will their be less discs than in the original set (I believe the original had seven discs), and if so, will the quality of the picture be reduced as a result? In most cases, companies have been careful with picture quality, and being able to cram more into a dvd has improved over the years as technology as advanced.

So, let's assume, the picture quality is great, and there are no extras in this set. Is it worth the 50 percent price cut from the original? I would think so! I've been a fan of this series for a long time, just waiting for this very moment when Viz would hear its fans calling for a cheaper set of the anime they know and love, and thus they have answered the call (hopefully).

So, give it a shot. Amazon has, of course, a 30-day money-back return policy. Also, it's only a matter of time before the rest of the seasons are released. And, assuming the prices will still remain steady, you'll be getting a great deal on a great anime. So, give in to your craving and go for it already! :)",1167091200,24,3616,4.640625

1647955,5,B00005QCW0,"I have to say the country of Japan has got to share its secrets with America in regards to film and television. Anime has recently grown in tremendous thanks to shows like Pokemon, Dragonball Z, and the Studio Gibli movies. Still, there is a much larger world that hasn't even begun to grow on this side of the globe.

Enter the world of romantic comedy anime style and its ringleader the ever-popular `Ranma '. This is the story of a boy named Ranma and his father and their journey to become the greatest martial artists with a major twist. On their journey they trained in the Valley of Cursed Springs, where within every pool a creature died a tragic death. Any being that happens to fall into one of the pools would take the shape of the creature that drowned in it. Out of all the cursed pools which one does our strapping young Ranma happen to fall into? The spring of the drowned girl! So now every time he gets wet, Ranma transforms into a spunky cute red headed girl. To change back he must douse himself with hot water...but it's only a matter of time until he finds a way to get wet again. If this idea of a story doesn't strike you as hilarious I don't know what will!

Now Ranma just found out he is to wed his fathers best friends daughter Akane. Unfortunately they don't like each other very much and he has to live under her roof until they get married. Get ready for the wacky first season of this Japanese phenomenon as Ranma begins a new chapter of his life with a new school, new friends, new enemies and even old enemies! The best part about all this mayhem is which Ranma are all these nut jobs looking for? And are they out for love...or revenge!?

1647956,4,B00005QCW0,I liked this season alot it introduces the characters nicely and it follows the comics somewhat closely. The only thing that kept it from receiving a five star rating was the voice acting for Ranma's character. I didn't like that fact that he sounds younger than he is portrayed to be. But I eventually got used to it. So I would still recomend it to anyone who likes mild humor.,1141948800,,379,4.428571428571429
1647957,4,B00005QCW0,"I bought this set and have watched it all the way through.  I enjoyed it a lot and would watch 4 or 5 episodes in one setting.  It could stand to be remastered to eliminate some of the quality issues (which the set notes are due to them being taken from a videotape master) but they're not objectionable.  It's a little slow and strained at first, but most new series are.  It's funny to see Ranma sometimes taking advantage of being able to be a girl and other times being disgusted with it.  The love story is typical teen angst, but it makes me hope that the final ending to the series ties that up somehow.  Beats me why Adult Swim won't air this - but watching it on DVD saves me sitting through commercials and goofy bumps.

Be forewarned:  There's nudity - how can there not be when Ranma needs a hot bath 5 times an episode, not to mention not being used to needing to be modest or even noticing the differences in his body (and how he can miss those is beyond me, but...) - but the only thing you ever see is breasts.. so if you object to animated boobies, you won't want to watch.  The last episode is mostly a clip show, also.  I've read that this series was cancelled when originally aired, which is why this first season is shorter (apparently it set the precedent for Family Guy to follow here in the US years later).  I'd guess the 18th ep was made with the knowledge it was or was about to be pulled.  The irony here is Genma has nore dialogue in this one than I think the whole previous 17 combined.  Unlike Ranma, he seems to prefer to spend time in his alternate form.",1135900800,,1587,4.21523178807947

1647962,5,B00005QCW0,"We love Ranma 1/2! The storylines are funny, the animation is well done, and it is one of the cleanest anime series out there, besides some of the VERY child-oriented series such as Hello Kitty. There is some very tame nudity, but only the occasional bare-chests-in-the-bath-type nudity; if you find bare chests offensive, you'd best stick with Hello Kitty. In addition, there is one ""dirty old man"" character, but all in all it's pretty mild. I have no problem letting my toddler watch this series; in fact, it is one of his favorites, and he almost always chooses a Ranma 1/2 when I let him pick a DVD to watch. He especially loves the music - Ranma 1/2 has great theme music! I also like it because it allows my son to be exposed to the Japanese language early on (we nearly always watch anime in Japanese with English subtitles). I doubt he'll burst out in Japanese at any moment from this influence, but I am hopeful that it will make him more comfortable with the sounds of the language if/when he goes to study it someday. The first season of Ranma 1/2 is important as it forms the background for the rest of the series (7 seasons, 1 series of OVA - Original Video Animation, and 2 movies). Ranma 1/2 is definitely one of the most popular anime series imported to the USA.",1121644800,3,1279,4.47008547008547
1647963,5,B00005QCW0,"The Ranma 1/2 TV series is considered to be one of the greatest anime of all time. I disagree. I am giving this boxed set 5 stars only because I love Ranma 1/2, not because I love this anime. I like the Ranma 1/2 manga more than any other manga, but that's a whole other story with the anime. The anime completely screwed Ranma 1/2 up. In the first season, it's actually pretty true to the manga, which makes it most fans' favorite season. I'm different, however. In my opinion, the animation is pretty shoddy. It's not bad, but not great either. Also, I wish they could have written the anime true to the manga all of the time, but this season animates the worst of the Ranma 1/2 chapters. And since the animation isn't great, I can't really call myself a fan.
In the later seasons, they really mess up. At least half of the episodes past season three tend to be anime-only (storylines that are made up by the anime's writers and only used in the anime) and rare are the anime-only episodes that aren't lazy, ugly, and downright lame. Plus, the animation shifts constantly from good to bad. The second season has what is in my opinion, the greatest animation of all the series (except the OAVs). The third season has animation that gradually grows from fair to sloppy. The fourth season is downright crude, and from there it progresses upward (not smoothly, just in general) but never to any amazing height. And the whole series leads up to an ending based off of a storyline that appeared around half-way through the manga. Less than half of the original chapters in the Ranma 1/2 manga were animated. Another fault the anime has is that when it does produce episodes based off of manga storylines, they are usually altered, whether it be large or slight. It could be to fit the time slot (in which case they could usually just do more than one episode) or it could be for absolutely no visible reason at all.
They also have represented characters in such a way to cause fans to make obscure romantic pairings. If you pay close attention to the manga, you'll notice, contrary to what most Ranma fans say that Shampoo really ISN'T in love with Mousse. If you pay close attention to the anime, you may realize that she does. And no, the anime doesn't count. Due to the anime not introducing the character Akari (Ryoga's love interest) some (most actually) fans have made the pairing of Ryoga and Ukyo. These two are not in love with each other. Ukyo wouldn't be caught dead with a ditz/spaz like Ryoga, and Ryoga only falls in love with girls who show affection towards him (Akane loves P-Chan, remember).
Also, not that the anime is at fault for making some moronic fans believe this, but Ranma is NOT meant for Shampoo or Ukyo. Shampoo is an evil, vile, horrible woman. Shampoo has no ounce of niceness in her (apparently the anime has led people to believe she has). She will use any chance she gets to kill Akane, in order to get her one, true love Ranma, whom she only loves due to a law that Amazonian must marry a man stronger than them. To her, Ranma would make an excellent breeder. Shampoo is so headstrong and selfish that to her, because she loves Ranma and because she's SO beautiful Ranma MUST love her back. In my opinion, Shampoo isn't even human.
As for Ukyo, she's not evil. She's tried many dirty tricks in her time to get ""Ranchan"" but they all fail. She's almost as headstrong as Shampoo in thinking Ranma loves her (though her reason is based off of Ranma calling her the ""cute fiance"" in an act to settle her rage). Many think of Ranma and Ukyo as being best-friends, but they haven't seen each other in ten years! I'm sure Ranma would choose Hiroshi or Daisuke over her (and if he was being honest, maybe even Akane).
As for Kodachi, I shouldn't even have to say. Kodachi is an even more headstrong, horrible, cheating woman who happens to look good in a leotard. However, never the type to be seduced by good looks (less the seduction is from Akane, as proven in volume 29) Ranma thinks of her as an embittered enemy. And Kuno annoys me (but I suppose you've gotta love him).
So that's that. My suggestion is read around five or so volumes of manga before purchasing this, or you will be exposed to the more vile form of Ranma 1/2 which may cause you to steer clear of the good form. Overall, I consider Ranma 1/2 to be the best manga around, though not the anime.",1098662400,,4389,4.460199004975125
1647964,5,B00005QCW0,If it wasn't for my cousin who got me into Ranma 1/2 I would've missed a great anime. This is the first season of Ranma 1/2 and it's probably one of the best.

1647965,5,B00005QCW0,"This is one of the best seasons of Ranma 1/2. The only downfall is that they introduced the character Shampoo very late in the season and was only in three episodes. This story is about a teenaged boy and his father who are martial artists. They went to Jusenkyo, a place in China to train. However, what they didn't know about Jusenkyo was that the hot springs are all cursed! If you touch the water of these hot springs you take shape of the animal or creature that drowned there last when splashed with cold water. Ranma turnes into a girl, Genma, his father, turns into a panda. Hot water reverses the effect.
Genma's friend, Soun is the leader of the ""anything-goes"" style of martial arts. Genma and Soun made a pact that Genma's son would marry one of Soun's daughter.

However, some parts of the DVD set are pretty funny.  The DVD's follow Ranma's adventures through the first three books.  The first thing any fan of the series will notice is the horrible voice overs.  They're bad the first time but you get used to them.  However, making Kuno sound like a drama club reject was bad, very bad.  I don't mean to say the show is bad, but some people may be dissapointed by what was left out or put in.  Anyone considering reading the Ranma 1/2 books or already enjoys the TV series will love this DVD set.  Even some of the serious fans of the book will enjoy this.  However, any of the more serious fans may feel something is missing or prefer to stick with the books.  I give it a half way to Ranma nervana 3 out of 5.",1092441600,3,1081,4.224390243902439
1647967,5,B00005QCW0,"Ranma 1/2 is by far the most entertaining anime series I have watched to date.  Having watched Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Dragonball (Z), etc. I have to say that Ranma 1/2 is easily the most original and hilarious. Although there is plenty of martial arts action, it is also refreshing that no-one ever gets killed. The premise of the Ranma 1/2 series lies in the hilarious situations that occur due to the love interests of the many colorful characters.  Needless to say Ranma is in the center of the whole convoluted scenario being the ""unwilling"" recipient of affections from both female and male suitors (while in his female form).  The fact that Ranma is able to turn into a girl makes for some of the funniest situations imaginable.
I have now watched the first 4 seasons of Ranma 1/2 in chronological order and I think seasons 1 and 2 are the best.  Season one introduces you to the main characters and sets the background for following episodes. Yet each episode is entertaining and usually adds a new character or interesting story element. Someone who is very familiar with the series may find some of the first few episodes ""thin"" because many of the main characters don't get introduced till later. However, for those who are relatively new, I think the build up in history and character development is perfect. Enough time is devoted to each new character introduced to give them some depth. In the season 1 set, the story line is relatively linear from episode to episode (each episode continues where the last left off).  In seasons 3 and 4 this no longer occurs quite as much with the some episodes becoming almost completely ""stand alone"".
In conclusion this is a set that all Ranma fans should have and anime fans that haven't yet watched Ranma should definitely start here.",1062374400,23,1787,4.751612903225807
1647968,5,B00005QCW0,"The first season of Ranma 1/2 is the one that relates the basic story. Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water; this is due to an accidental dunking, in a cursed Chinese pool. The initial story is very funny as Ranma and his dad (who also got dunked but in another pool) arrive at his dad's best friend Soun Tendo's house. Their purpose is for Ranma to become engaged to one of Soun's three daughters. Soun and his daughters are waiting, but they have no clue who has arrived when a girl, and a giant panda show up on their doorstep.

The series goes on to introduce many of the main characters that will either be Ranma's competition, or his potential romantic interests during the series. Rumika Takahashi has a knack for inventing the funniest, and most varied kinds of martial arts. Throughout the entire Ranma series, there must be more than 100 different forms including Martial Arts Pickle Making, Martial Arts Gymnastics, Martial Arts Pizza Making, Martial Arts Figure Skating, and Martial arts Tea Ceremony.

Ranma is an episodic series, and for that reason after you see the first series here, (which gives you the basic story and characters) you can buy or rent any DVD from any subsequent season. You might miss a character introduction somewhere but that's usually not a problem. The only important continuing storyline thread is about Ranma's relationship with Akane, his arranged fianc. He talks like the relationship does not matter, but his actions give him away. He generally resists the scheming and plans of all the other women out to capture his heart, most of which got that way through the funniest of circumstances.

Outside of his fianc, Ranma's only other passions are fighting, and trying to figure out a way to lift the curse that turns him into a girl. In a lot of ways the characters in this show may be like the Japanese version of the Simpsons. Takahashi has added dozens characters motivated by greed, revenge, love, hate, desperation, and perversion. Many are really funny images of some of the characters we all know. She somehow manages to present all of their diverse emotions in a funny, and generally light-hearted manner.
This is one of the longest running and best anime series from Japan, but by the time you get to the seventh season, the material gets a little thin. Like most TV shows anime or live action, the first season is generally among the best, and for anime fans this is a must own. A classic anime concept from one of the all time classic anime authors!

Rumika Takahashi has had a prolific career creating new anime series and being able to change her style and come up with new concept each time. From aliens (LUM) to boarding houses (Maison Ikkoku), to martial arts (Ranma 1/2), to ancient Japanese folklore (Inu Yasha), her constants are an incredible imagination, and a universal humor. Along the way her artistic talents have gotten better, and her story talent more refined. You really can't go wrong with any of her works.",1055894400,7,2996,4.755769230769231

To get through the typical blather, Ranma ends up being engaged to Akane Tendo--at 16, the youngest of the Tendo daughters--despite both of their objections, so that they might inherit the Dojo.

This may be in part because it is a 'continuing saga,' almost soap-opera style.  I genuinely came to care about the characters and couldn't stop watching, being transfixed on what would come of the cris-crossing relationships.  You'd think it was a serious show...but the general tone is goofy, kind of slapstick humor, with Ranma getting routinely flattened by his enraged, 'fiance' Akane.  There is something much deeper underneath all this--maybe because the swirling craziness of all the different clashing personalities of Ranma's past scandals and Akane's frantic suitors remind me of how tumoltuous high school really is...The series captures so well the changes you go through during that time... and since it includes little glimpses into the Tendo family's daily routine, it makes it all the more realistic.  It's hard to describe how enduring the characters are...even Kuno gets you rooting for him. I haven't seen the second season yet, but I'm told it gets even less serious and more wacky...disappointing, as I thought the semi-realistic edge (beyond the insane abilities of the martial artists) gave this series a unique sparkle.

This is a really good opening to the series and is a little more true to the origional comics. I've laughed outloud more times than I can count. I only had a few problems with it. The voice actress change for the femail Ranma on the english version was a good move (the origional sounds a bit like a chipmunk), but I wish they'd had the second actress from the beginning as in the clip eppisode it becomes clear how they don't really match. But, if you turn on the Japanese version (which is a bit better cast in my oppinion anyways), it won't matter. Other than that, it's not the greatest series I've seen, but it's up there.",1041465600,,718,4.358208955223881
1647978,4,B00005QCW0,"Plot: Ranma and his father, Genma, go to China for martial arts training, and they train on poles above enchanted pools even though they are warned of the dangers. Well, Ranma and Genma both fall in pools, Ranma into the pool of the young maiden and Genma into the pool of the panda. Because of the enchantment on the pools, they both now change into something else when they get cold water on them, then back to their true form with warm water, Ranma becomes a girl and Genma a panda. This causes much hilarity. In the first episode they go to stay with Genma's old friend Tendo, and Ranma becomes engaged to Tendo's daughter Akane. A boy named Kuno ends up in love with both Akane and Girl-Ranma, causing even more hilarity.
My thoughts: Recommended. Very, very funny. Animation wise it's ok, the character design isn't pretty like things by Yu Watase or Clamp, but it's not bad, just a different style. The dub is pretty good, I like the way Akane's VA says ""There's a pervert in the bathroom!"", Ranma's voice isn't bad either. Kuno is a very funny character.
I give it 4 stars instead of 5 beacuse even though it's a good show, very funny, and recommended, it's really just comedy and it's not as good as other anime that I've seen, so I wouldn't feel right giving it the same ranking.",1037577600,,1289,4.466101694915254

Warning though: The OAV movies aren't nearly as good. Starting out with the series is the best way to go. I'd only seen one of the OAV's and didn't like it but from what I've been told the others movies aren't any better.",1036540800,,486,4.072916666666667

The story is about a guy, Ranma, that fell into a cursed spring (very tragic story, young girl drown in spring about 1200 year ago; now everyone who fall in spring take body of young woman). Although the base of the story is far fetched, the relationships are made of the same fabric as reality (except for Shampoo's, but she's anything but the norm).

This training ground is cursed and has Springs of drowned SOMETHINGS, While training Genma falls into Spring of drowned Panda, so when splashed with cold water, Genma turns to a panda and splashed with hot water turns back to a man. And Ranma...well he fell in spring of drowned girl. So you gessed it, he turns into a girl.
Season 1 is one of the best there is,
Ranma meets the Tendos who also hold the name of ANYTHING GOS MARTIAL ARTS, and Ranma has a fiance! Who is it!
Tatewaki Kuno is a kendo master and is in love with Akane Tendo, it seems that he becomes one of Ranmas many rivals.
Ryoga Hebiki is a boy with no sense of direction, he searches for Ranma for revenge, but what could Ranma have done to him to make him want to kill him!?

1647983,5,B00005QCW0,"If I tell you this anime is about an exceptional good martial artist boy who turns into a girl when cold water splashs him, son of a light living lazy father who turns into a panda, about a regular martial artist girl who hates boys, about an amazon girl who turns into a cat, about a lost boy (who gets lost going to the bathroom) who turns into a pig... Wouldn't you wonder what kind of sick plot it has? I'll tell you, is about love.
Full of traditional japanese situations, you'll get to know the Tendo family, whose hosts bring all kinds of funny troubles, and where the love is the center of each chapter. Yes, it has nudity (the naked tops appears once in a while), but they are funny instead of erotical. This is the first season of this, one of the gratest anime series of all times (for the japanese people). 18 chapters (17 really, the last one is just a serie of past scenes).  4 Dvds in japanese and english. Too bad the japanese tracks are in mono.
If you buy it, you'll feel that sensation again, when you loved someone but never have the courage to say ""I love you"".",1022457600,6,1082,4.252427184466019
1647984,5,B00005QCW0,"Just in case you've never seen Ranma 1/2, here's the plot in a nutshell: on a training mission with his father, Ranma falls into a cursed spring and now turns into a girl (who happens to be red-haired and...er, well-endowed) when doused with cold water, and back into a boy with hot. Everything else is just a zany, ever-expanding web of elaboration on this main theme. It's closely based on the long-running, successful Japanese manga (comic book) of the same name.
The show has a huge cast of characters, including but not limited to: Ranma's reluctant fiancee, Akane; his father, Genma, and his rival, Ryoga, both of whom have their own curse; Tatewaki Kuno and his sister Kodachi, who are in love with female and male Ranma respectively; and about a zillion other characters who are introduced later in the series.
This first DVD set has the entire first season of the TV show. All of the episodes are good, with the exception of the last one (which is a ""lousy clip show,"" to quote the Simpsons). It takes you through many of the major events of Ranma 1/2: Ranma and Akane's first meeting and the introduction of Ryoga, the Kunos, and Chinese amazon Shampoo.
The DVD format is ideal for anime, and this is no exception. Allowing you to see it both subtitled and dubbed, letting you skip to your favorite chapter, and creditless opening and closing segments are just a few of the perks with the DVD version. Just keep in mind that the animation (which was done about ten years ago) was not terribly high-quality to begin with - don't be disappointed if it doesn't look like more modern, glossy animation, and rest assured that it still looks much better on DVD than it ever did on VHS.",1020556800,15,1689,4.614617940199335
1647985,4,B00005QCW0,"This box-set is the first season of (after viewing it) a memorable anime series. As someone new to Ranma I bought the OAV set first, and while it was very entertaining it left me with questions!
This set explains it all, from where and how Ranma got his curse to why he's afraid of Cats and gets chased by nearly everything in a skirt (apart from Akane) around him.
As for the technical side, the transfer is very good, with only a few noticeably pixellated scenes. One down is that there are hard-subtitles for some things (signs, some on-screen text etc..), while I would've preferred the original japenese text with optional subtitles for them.
There are some shimmering overlays (additions to the original material), usually the english ranma logo, which really should've been done better.
The sound is good, although I must admit I had to gulp when it said 'Japanese (mono)' on the back of the box. Is it really mono? I couldn't really tell, it sounded perfectly alright to me, but I only have a stereo sound installation.
There aren't really any extras to speak of, just text-less opening/credits.
But then again, it's the series that mattters and despite some obvious old-age problems of the material it's very enjoyable.
I would recommend this set to anyone interested/new to Ranma and of course to old-time fans of Ranma.",1020211200,2,1330,4.812227074235808
1647986,4,B00005QCW0,"Ranma 1/2, the gender switching comedy by Rumiko Takahashi, has long been a favorite of fans. Closer to Urusei Yatsura than Maison Ikkoku, Takahashi returns to a high school setting and ultimately a more episodic plot. This first season retains more of a continuous plot than any of the later seasons, and introduces most of the main characters. Though the series eventually becomes tedious, this season is fresh and fun. Anyone who calls him or herself an anime fan should definitely take a look. The Ranma dub is notorious among fans that suffered without subtitled versions for years. This DVD set solves this problem once and for all, including both Japanese with English subtitles, and the well-done English dub. Anyone who has never heard Megumi Hayashibara's Girl-type Ranma should watch it just for that.
The box is nice, but the DVDs are no frills. The Furinkan Gazettes, although no liner notes, would still have been a nice addition. Still, this is a great series and a good box set. I highly recommend it. Four stars.",1015200000,3,1029,4.885714285714286

If there was a particular season of Ranma to buy, this one's gotta be it.  There is nothing more funny than watching the introductions of all the wacky and zany characters of the Ranma universe.  From the lustful Kuno to the hopelessly lost Ryoga, the laughs are limitless.  Very highly recommended.",1014595200,2,428,4.653333333333333

My 4 year old daughter knows every character and episode, and my 2 1/2 year old son is learning them as well.  They watch these dvd's over and over and over.  There is little to no cursing in them.  None that I can recall offhand.  The violence is not gory, the characters are very deep, and the stories are highly entertaining.  For us parents, this anime is very funny, mature in the way that most ""cartoons"" are, and suck me in just as often as they do the kids.
We did not start watching Ranma with the first season.  We purchased a 3 episode DVD after my daughter saw previews to the movie Big Trouble...on the end of a Pokemon video and liked the song and the giant panda.  It was not hard to get involved, even in the middle of the series, nor was it difficult to understand the premise.
Parents can feel safe about letting their kids watch Ranma.",1011571200,,1053,4.107317073170732

1647993,5,B00005QCW0,"Finally, the first season of Ranma 1/2 on DVD.  There are three major reasons to get this:
(1) The first few episodes introduce the enchanted spring phenonema and establishes the Ranma/Akane relationship.  Nowhere else in the series was this done adequately.
(2) The introduction of the Shampoo character.  Rumiko's blend of Love, martial arts and gags reaches its zenith here.  This is perhaps one of the best anime episodes ever produced.
(3) I really love this first season because this is where creator Rumiko Takahashi has creative control.  There is a subtleness in the humor and relationships that was unfortunately lost in the later seasons.  Rumiko's mastery lets you actually feel what the characters are feeling as the story progresses.
This is an all time classic for people who wish to collect the best of anime.
Caution: This series contains ""comic nudity"". It's not kinky stuff, but just illustrates how Ranma doesn't have modesty after getting transformed into a girl after contact with cold water.  It's not a ""sex comedy"" but a ""gender comedy"" focusing on relationship and gender roles.",1007856000,18,1104,5.1
