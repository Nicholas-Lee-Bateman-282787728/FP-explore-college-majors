2466224,5,B000CNEQW8,"I don't know what's wrong with the guy who said he was horrible and stole his material: he must be jealous of Carlos' success.  I think Mencia is awesome!  He is fresh, talented, witty, funny, smart as hell and one of the best stand-up comedians I've had the pleasure of witnessing.  He tells it like it is - his jokes are based on reality for the most part, which always makes it funnier since people can relate in some way or another, and his facial expressions just take the cake!  He's unbelievable.  I'm glad he's around and look forward to laughing my ass off at future shows.  =)",1141776000,2,586,4.37962962962963

2466274,1,B000CNEQW8,"If this is the show used to fill in the tragically canceled Chappelle's Show, then there is no God.

Carlos Mencia is a worthless ""comedian"" who can't imagine things beyond being racist. He always compares Mexicans to other people, but sorry to break the ice, but Mencia is not Mexican. He is a mix of Honduran and German, no Mexican in his blood at all. The man's jokes are rehashed, idiotic, and downright cruel and unfunny. If there weren't stereotypes in this world, then this show wouldn't have existed. At least when Dave Chappelle does his stereotypical jokes, he doesn't have to enhance them with mindless yelling and he knows what he's talking about.

I would give the man much more respect if he admitted that he was Honduran. I'd also give him more respect if he wasn't always using degrading Mexican jokes and actually opened up his mind. But no, this is how it turns out. Save yourself the trouble and watch anything else on Comedy Central besides this.",1185408000,11,966,4.676470588235294
2466275,1,B000CNEQW8,"Lord, there are few shows I hate more than this one; if I hear it/see it/feel its evil presence, I scramble for my remote. If this is the new Dave Chappelle, we are in a bad, bad place.

That being said, I realize that this man and his show have an absolutely HUGE fan base. Then again, I've given up trying to understand the high ratings of shows like these since ""The Man Show"" was in its heyday.

Apart from his legendary reputation amongst stand-ups for joke stealing, or even the fact that he clearly is either ashamed of/wants to hide his real ethnicity (no, he is NOT Mexican, and Carlos Mencia is not even his real name), the real issue is this: the show is simply not funny.

Say what you will about Dave Chappelle, his skits (whether precise political commentaries, impressions, or just silliness) were plain funny. Rolling on the floor funny. Now, I realize that Comedy Central was left scrambling for a Chappelle replacement, but can they not do better than this? No one can live up to Chappelle, but Mencia isn't even MILDLY amusing. Plus, is it too much to ask that Comedy Central consider another African-American comedian/comedienne to fill the spot?

In ""Mind of Mencia"" Comedy Central asks too much of its viewers. If we are supposed to move on from Dave Chappelle, please give us more to work with.",1177459200,10,1317,4.591489361702128

2466293,1,B000CNEQW8,"While surfing the channels one night, I happen to stumble upon Mind of Mencia. I attempted to get into the show, and actually watched a few episodes, but barely got more then a slight chuckle. I usually love Comedy Central, but this effort by Ned ""Carlos Mencia"" Holness simply isn't funny.

I'm not going to go into detail about how he's really Honduran/German and not Mexican, or that he's been accused by several other comedians of stealing material, I'll simply comment on what I saw. And what I saw simply lacked comedic value.

He's often compared to Dave Chappelle, but Dave Chappelle's racial remarks are made in a very smart, interesting, and often unique manner, and Chappelle show didn't need to be racist to be funny (like the Rick James skit)

Mind of Mencia is very formulaic and often breaks down into: White people do _________, while Mexicans do _________.

Its just not funny.",1165104000,13,894,4.785714285714286

2466297,4,B000CNEQW8,"Mencia comes across as curmudgeonly as Carlin in content but more affable in personality. One of his targets is the insularity of his own Latino demographic, whose response to Anglo bigotry has of recent years been to form a submerged nationality within America. Mencia's response is a ""wanna make somethin' of it"" pride in this country. He reminds me at times of a Venezuelan-born former girlfriend of my brother, whose hobby horse is communities here in South Florida like Miami's ""Little Havana"". ""Those people put their lives on the line to get here. A lot of them have relatives who didn't make it."" she comments. ""Now they only shop at stores where there's a lot of merchandise labeled in Spanish. It's like you have to attend special schools not everyone can afford so you can learn English? That's nonsense--I learned English by SPEAKING it."" People like this lady and entertainers like Carlos Mencia are to be listened to lest this country fall into an non-geographic Balkanization that won't be good for us in the long or the short run. Or to quote a bit of hip hop verse from Mencia himself; ""If you don't know, take it from me--you're a dee dee dee.""",1160956800,2,1162,4.729064039408867
2466298,5,B000CNEQW8,"I have been watching his shows for a long time and his comedy never gets old. I have to say that it is refreshing to see some one that is willing to not be politically correct and go against the mainstream.

His shows always have something new to offer and although they are funny, they open your mind to allot of issues that are occuring every day.",1160006400,2,349,4.208955223880597
2466299,2,B000CNEQW8,"Before you click the not helpful button, understand that I've been a fan of Carlos Mencia's comedy since the early/mid 90's.  The problem with Carlos is the fact that his jokes never change.  If you've heard one of his acts, you've heard all of his acts.  The first time I ever heard him do stand up I couldn't stop laughing at it.  He was laugh out loud funny to me (which almost never happens with me).  But as the years went on, I found that Carlos Mencia's material would rarely change.  I'm not easily offended.  In fact, I love risk taking comedians, but after a while I began to feel like I'd heard everything Carlos had to say.

Fast forward to late 2005/early 2006 and Comedy Central is in a hectic scramble to fill the void that the unintentional smash hit, Chappelle's Show, left after Dave Chappelle goes M.I.A. because he doesn't like the direction of the show is taking.  Thus, Mind Of Mencia is born.  I said to myself ""Carlos is getting a show?  This ought to be great.""  When I tuned in to watch, I found that the show was a b-level version of Chappelle's Show with a hispanic twist and, in a way, it's no fault of Mencia's.  Comedy Central felt like they needed something similar to Chappelle's Show to keep the huge fan base that Chappelle had brought to the channel.  Insert Carlos Mencia.  The blatant imitation coupled with the fact that Mencia talks about the same thing over and over and you have Mind Of Mencia.  Like another reviewer said, Chappelle did jokes about racists while Mencia did racist jokes.

If you're new to Mencia's comedy then you'll love it (like I did when I first heard him in the early 90's).  But if you've been listening to him for a while now, then you know he's been talking about the same stuff for at least 12 years and it's beyond repetitive now.  The show is like his stand up -- funny in spots.  The show misses more than it hits and when it does hit, it won't generate anything above a chuckle.

Simply put, Dave Chappelle was like sugar.  You'd tune in, watch it, and you'd become addicted to it.  If Dave was sugar, then Mencia is Splenda.  You tune in to the substitute, watch it, and find that it has a familiar flavor......but with a terrible aftertaste.",1157932800,6,2216,4.428217821782178
2466300,5,B000CNEQW8,He is too funny... if you are easily offended... or don't really want to hear the truth this isn't for you.  This is a man speaking about what he beleives and really not caring... keep up the good work Mencia... Can't wait for Season 2!!!,1157587200,2,238,4.288888888888889

2466302,5,B000CNEQW8,I know some people hate on Carlos Mencia but I think his comedy is genious.  You can't compare it to Chapelle Show because Chapelle comes from a different view point.  I know how it is growing up in a diverse city and I understand where he's coming from.  In this day and age people try to tell you what to do and say but in reality people have the right to say and think what they want; period.,1155772800,2,395,4.038461538461538

2466304,4,B000CNEQW8,"I didn't think I liked Carlos Mencia at first. He seemed like too much of a mean jock, but in the commentaries and behind the scenes bits he's more laid back than when he's doing his on stage persona. Likewise I thought his constant racial material was just to be anti-""PC"", but after a while I realised how getting everyone to laugh at jokes about their own race as well as everyone else's achieves the result of people seeing race as less of an issue. He's essentially playing a character, and the confidence and enthusiasm with which he does it is a major part of what makes the show so entertaining. It's annoying how he keeps reminding you that you're supposed to think he's offensive though. It's a really entertaining show though. I like it more than I expected to.",1148947200,2,772,4.521428571428571
2466305,5,B000CNEQW8,"Carlos tells it like it is. That is all there is to it. If you can't laugh at yourself, then don't watch this DVD, it ain't for you.

Carlos is about making us take a long look at ourselves and then each other. He warns right up front that he will offend. He is an equal opportunity offender. And I love it.

Thank you Carlos, for making people think. That is what it is really all about. If more people listened to him, this world would probably be a better place.",1146441600,3,465,4.0989010989010985
2466306,4,B000CNEQW8,"I'm sorry, but Dave Chappelle set the standard for this type of show, that being stand-up/skit show that skates on the edge of the line of obscene, and Carlos Mencia just borrowed from Chappelle's brilliant idea. Fortunately, though, Mencia does more than enough to set himself apart from Chappelle's Show to make this at least feel somewhat unique. And not only that, but Carlos Mencia is one of the better comedians out today, so using a tried and true formula with a proven comedian promises a good show.

And this show is fricken hilarious. Carlos's constant racism does nothing to offend and everything to amuse. I kind of felt during the whole thing that everything is a joke with Mencia, and the fact that he makes fun of himself more often than he does others is probably what does this. And the street skits he does are great, where he basically goes out and spreads his form of comedy while also enlightening us on the common racial stereotypes in the funniest of ways. He also ends ever show with a skit of sorts, usually with Carlos dressing up as some strange character and performing in before the studio audience.

I was disappointed with the DVD release, though. The special features were all that great. The bloopers were over way to quick, no one really needs to see a making of a show like this, and I haven't had the chance to see the deleted scenes but if they were deleted then there wasa probably a good reason for it. And now for the audio commentary: I don't speak Spanish, and though I know that's probably the comedy of it, you just can't get anything out of this unless you speak Spanish.

With the exception of the special features, though, this a good and inexpensive collection that goes great with Chappelle's Show fans. If you like edgy comedy and aren't easily offended, then pick this up. The uncensored version makes this a little funnier than what it was when it was TV.",1146009600,11,1907,4.586510263929619
2466307,5,B000CNEQW8,"I can see why people think Mencia is not funny, I actually used to be the exact same way, then my boyfriend made me watch it over and over again. He thought it was hilarious. Now I have to agree, at first I thought he was crude and horrible, now I think he is hilarious. And I just bought the first season on DVD. He at least has the balls to say what most people think. despite of how we try everyone has their sterotypes no matter how much we deny it. At least he has the nerve to bring light to it. Besides hes not the first to make fun of race, doesn't almost every comedian do that? Make fun of sterotypes? Thats exactly what he does.",1145577600,2,639,4.0
2466308,5,B000CNEQW8,"I am constantly amazed by the immaturity and name-calling of some of the reviews here. You're all a bunch of sissies and cry babies. Firstest, Carl is about making us look inside of our own hearts and minds. He uncovers truth. He's what I like to call a ""truthsayer"" vs. a soothsayer. He slaughters the sacred cows. Which explains why this show will never work in India. If he makes us laugh in the process, that's a bonus, but IT IS NOT HIS INTENT! Check the roster of Carlo's staff: The writers  come from A&E, PBS, ""Law & Order,"" ""Headline News"" ""C-Span"" ""60 Minutes"" ""Two and a Half Men"" etc. What do those networks/shows have in common? They're serious shows! Not about laughter. And this show is no different. truth be told, Carlos has more in common with Edward R. Murrow than Dave Chappelle. So stop making that comparison because it does NOT work and just shows how shallow and immature you are.

Who cares if he's honduran, mexican, american, australian, or martian, it DOESN'T MATTER.  He speaks his mind and it's funny as hell.  If you don't like it, don't buy it.  If you haven't bought it, don't review it.  If you bought it and didn't like it, then you have a right to post a negative review here...after all, thats what reviews are for.  But I think its hilarious how good he is at passing himself off as a mexican when he's not, and then by doing so can talk about them in a way anyone else can't.

Also, where I live, and work...the whole area is dominated by illeagal mexiacan immigrants...where 10 years ago there were almost no mexicans in the area.  They work jobs for 8 bucks an hour that a documented worker and citizen would otherwise get paid 15-20 dollars an hour.

I'm not sure why he's not funny, he's doing the exact same thing Dave Chappelle is doing except from a Mexican's POV. I think it is because he tries too hard. The only thing mildly funny are the commercials advertising the show. This is the kind of show you want to have on for ambient noise, like if you are on a computer or talking to someone on the phone. BTW, I love shows like Wonder Showzen, Family Guy, and Drawn Together, and I rarely get offended.

The only thing I have heard from the people who dislike the style of Mr. Mencia is that hes not really mexican. Well no crap. He openly admits being of honduran decent. What do you care anyways? You cant overlook the fact that he is not Mexican. Who cares if his given name was Ned and he grew up in east LA. I know I sure dont. It doesnt take away from his comedy one bit. He says things in front of a crowd of racially diverse people that I bet each and every one of us would be a little hesitant to do. All I have to say is I love his show and I cant wait for the new episodes. This DVD is awesome and it won't disappoint. And for those of you who don't like him, change the channel and find something else to b**** and moan about.",1143504000,11,809,3.8502994011976046
2466315,5,B000CNEQW8,"I'm in total agreement with the reviewer who says this show is a existential parody of the standard racialist (see Chappelle) comedy skit show. People please! Check yourself before you wreck yourself. Mencia is a modern day Orson Wells. He's laughing at us, by making us NOT laugh at him. If you look closely you'll see that there's not a unique or interesting (and certainly not amusing) thing said throughout this DVD -- but that's point, you cads. The joke is on YOU, so you should be laughing at yourself, not hating on Charlos.",1143417600,5,532,4.670212765957447

That's a quote  from NO STRINGS ATTACHED, but it sums up the Mencia philosophy.  What makes me laugh (out loud, and sometimes even before I realize I'm laughing)is the element of truth (or sometimes the stereotype that we accept as the truth) in his show. (I watched the first season of Mind of Mencia and his openning monologues (alone!) are worth the price of an admission ticket to see him live.)

Carlos Mencia is ""calling out"" the elephant-in-the-room (race)and if it makes you mad enough to talk about it -

People want to call him a hack but they will never say what jokes he has stolen.  That is what is great about Carlos Mencia he picks on everyone.  If you don't like the show don't watch it.  If your going to write a negative comment please write it about the Mind of Mencia not Carlos Mencia.  It doesn't matter what ethnicity he is because FUNNY DOSEN'T HAVE A COLOR!!!

2466319,1,B000CNEQW8,"let me offer my insight....

Anyone who figures that Carlos Mencia is intellectual in any way is a dumb ass.  He is just plain not funny.  This is how i see it:  it's REALLY EASY to rag on EVERYONE.  it takes no balls whatsoever.  if he's intellectual at all, his genius lies in his (correct) assumption that by making fun of everyone possible, he will come across as edgy.  in fact, it's about as un-edgy as you can get.  as long as i fruitlessly try to offend every racial/ethnic/religious group possible, then in the end i don't really offend anyone.  it's hard to get mad at mencia because even if he's tried to make fun of whatever group you associate yourself with, he's done the same to just about everyone else. if he had any balls at all, he'd pick out some particular group to make fun of, but in this day and age, that would probably keep him off tv and therefore severely limit his income.  carlos mencia is about the worst comic out there, and is about as PC as you can get in his own way.",1143158400,9,1002,4.253968253968254
2466320,5,B000CNEQW8,"In response to the ""Ant Popper's"" so called ""review"" below, Carlos was renamed Carlos by his aunt and uncle who raised him and their last name was Mencia.

Have you ever watched the show?

If so, you might have recalled a certain phrase that Carlos uses for people like yourself...

2466322,5,B000CNEQW8,"Firstly this show is the s***. It is funny in a rude and sterotypical way, and shows all the racial and ethnical idiosyncrasies that we are all too afraid to bring to light, especially in the public eye. Secondly, why do you people care that he takes a stage name as Carlos Mencia, and that he isn't Mexican. He openly admits to being houduran on the show and this does not at all take away from the true comical genius that he brings to this show. If you at all enjoy Dave Chappelle, or comedy in general, this DVD is a must.",1142726400,10,526,4.166666666666667
2466323,2,B000CNEQW8,"Pellington's guide to becoming a popular comedian:

1: If you're white in the ""traditional"" sense, you can only become a ""nerdy"" comedian. You can be an ""angry nerdy comedian,"" but still nerdy. If you aren't white in the ""traditional"" sense, (As in Carlos, who is actually only half German) this entitles you to force an accent and adopt a culture that you have nothing to do with. This also entitles you scrape the bottom of the racial jokes barrel, since you're not 100% Caucasian, you're obviously just kidding. (White people who tell racial jokes are seeking a fourth reich, and must be stopped.)

2: If someone in the audience doesn't laugh, it's NEVER because you're not funny, it's because they are weak PC hall monitors shackled and brainwashed by modern-day taboos. Make sure the rest of the audience knows this; This simultaneously makes you seem genuinely funny, and edgy & ahead of your time.

3: Catch-phrases. It matters not how contrived and bland they are, the amount of teenagers you get to awkwardly imitate you at a lunch table is directly equivalent to your worth as a comedian. DEE DEE DEE. (For situations to apply this catch-phrase, see rule 2.)

4: Midgets. A show isn't funny without midgets.

5: Make sure to fill a void in comedy fans' lives. Make people say, ""This guy is the new _____!""

Follow these five rules and become famous for a couple years-- or at least until Chappelle's Show returns. Just like Carlos!",1142467200,14,1441,4.767068273092369
2466324,5,B000CNEQW8,"Here's the thing, most people are not going to understand this show. Mind of Mencia is an uber-intellectual highbrow parody of a comedy show. It's a postmodern statement about the futility of the man's existence. And try as we might to define ourselves by race or heritage the fact remains that we all want the same things, but we'll all ultimately end up dead. So I salute Mencia and his writers for not going for the easy or multiple laughs. What may look like a straightforward sketch or bit is multi-layered and oozing with the subtlest of observations about the human condition. So for those who don;t like it, I suggest watching it again - maybe this time with your eyes open - you'll enjoy it.",1142467200,6,700,4.563492063492063
2466325,5,B000CNEQW8,"Very few stand-up comics are all that good, let alone great, let alone superb, and Mencia is SUPERB.  The combination of his corrosive wit, killer facial expressions, and verbal deliveries make for a treasure trove of laughs.

Add to that his ensemble of goofy characters and skits, the man becomes a modern day Flip Wilson.  Some reviewers are upset the man isn't really Mexican.  Does it really matter?  He rips on everyone fair and square.  Besides, ripping on Hondurans just isn't all that funny, is it?  And as far as ""replacing Chapelle"", to that I say ""GREAT!"".  Mencia is 10X the stand-up comic, and his humor isn't based on being foul or semi demented.  And you'll never see old Carlos in a South African nut hatch!

Can't wait for these discs to arrive!!

UPDATE:  I got the discs last night, but so far I'm not seeing the final (recapping) episode where he's in a hospital bed after being attacked by W dressed as a land shark.  Granted much of that was rehash footage, but in between was some darn funny and fresh stuff:

Carlos: ""Who are you?""

Joseph:  ""I am your brother, Joseph.""

Carlos:  ""Wooooooahh my gawd, I'm a BEANER!!!""

I checked the extra footage on Disc 2, but didn't find those bits.  Am I simply not finding them? HELP!",1142380800,4,1248,4.586363636363636
2466326,1,B000CNEQW8,"Carlos Mencia is not who we thought he was.  First of all, his name is not Carlos Mencia but Ned Holness.  He is half German and half Honduran, not Mexican.  There is a huge difference between Mexicans and Hondurans, similar to when former Soviet countries (like Ukraine) hated being called Russian, because they weren't.  There are huge differences between Mexican culture, Mexican-American culture, and Hondurans (and Germans for that matter).  Now changing your birth name to a stage name is a well known practice, but here it's definitely seems like a cynical move with Carlos, who goes around pretending he's Mexican and does the racial angle that's been done before (and better) by Chappelle and Pryor (to name a few).  Many have compared Mencia to Chappelle, but Chappelle is very easy in his skin, is much more insightful, and much funnier.  Ned is belligerent, crass, and obnoxious.  I HAVE SEEN these episodes (even though some reviewers have suggested I haven't), and it's pretty obvious Comedy Central is trying to emulate Chappelle with this guy.  He ain't even close to Chappelle.  And he rips off other comedians quite brazenly, including Bill Cosby himself!  Once in a while you will laugh, then you'll feel uncomfortable, because Mencia is so belligerent, you feel like you have to laugh or he will come into the audience and kill you.  Even if you disregard the fact that he's passing himself off as a Mexican (which is hard to do, as he always makes a point of it in almost every bit he does), and just judge the material on the DVD's, it still isn't very good.  Pass on this, buy Chappelle's show instead.  Thank you and good night...",1142294400,15,1654,4.798586572438163
2466327,5,B000CNEQW8,"So he's Honduran, so what? Mencia grew up in East LA; how much more ""Beaner"" do you want?

I'm Puerto Rican and I think Mencia is hysterical, especially the way he rants against stupidity without regard to race, creed, color or national origin.  He and Chapelle are cut from the same cloth, but their styles are distinct.

Yes, he is not afraid to offend, very refreshing in an era of  bocorrectness, and joins the ranks of Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor, who raised many an eyebrow.  I'm anxiously awaiting season two.",1142121600,34,518,4.648351648351649
