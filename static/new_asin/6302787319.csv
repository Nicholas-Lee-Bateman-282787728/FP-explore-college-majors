7831300,3,6302787319,I purchased this movie a couple years ago. I had it confused with another movie. I did enjoy it. It's an 80's B rated movie.,1458086400,,124,4.0
7831301,5,6302787319,"I really enjoyed this movie when it first aired on the Science Fiction Channel.  Watching it brings back some great memories.  I thought the characters were well played by all and the premise interesting.  I thought Robbie Benson's performance was especially moving as the creator of Star Shield (a.k.a Lucy) who starts to develop human emotions with good and bad implications. I guess the underlying message might be about the dangers of technology taking control of our lives, but I think it's just a fun romantic fantasy not meant to take itself too seriously.  I'd like to see it on DVD, but I guess its out of print.",1313798400,,621,4.722222222222222
