1094724,1,6305958041,The movie starts slow and never picks up speed.  A total flop of a film with nothing to show for it's lame plot lines and hokey ending.  I was completely disappointed with this one.,962150400,,181,4.294117647058823
1094725,5,6305958041,"This is a great film despite what the critics say. Gary Sinise puts in a good performance as the washed out astronaut Jim McConnell who heads a rescue team to Mars after the mysterious death of three of the four astronauts already on the planet. Okay, so this quite is a slow moving film but it has superb special effects, pretty good acting, and a great cast all round. The plot isn't too complicated either; it follows the rescuers as they head for Mars and the trials and tribulations they face on the long and monotonous journey to the Red Planet. There is a fantastic space walk scene with Tim Robbins, some fun moments in the form of a ""perfect"" woman's DNA made entirely of sweets, and the occasional gruesome part such as the freezing to death of Tim Robbins character when he commits suicide outside the space craft in order to save his wife and crew. The rescue mission has now become a fight for survival for the three remaining astronauts who finally land on the Red Planet after loosing most of their space ship to a fuel leak. They do however find the only survivor of the previous expedition played brilliantly by Don Cheadle who has gone ""native"" for want of a better description. Together the four astronauts try to find out what killed Cheadle's friends and in doing so come across Mars incredible secret; once long ago Mars was inhabited, and its legacy lies deep underground, but earlier disturbance by Cheadle and his now dead companions (look out for the great whirlwind that effect that wipes out the first expedition) has bought it to the surface and it is a gigantic carving of humanoid looking face. It is this face that will led the Astronauts to the most breathtaking discovery of all; the origin of life on earth. This film is well worth seeing though you wouldn't believe it after the panning it got. I have fast come to the opinion that many critics aren't interested in intelligent science fiction anymore, but rather want blockbusters like ""The Phantom Menace"" which is great fun but don't exactly put a strain on the little gray cells. Mission to Mars is intelligent whilst still being enjoyable, fun whilst still being serious. So come on folks so many of you liked ""2001 A Space Odessey"" when it came out so why not give Mission to Mars a chance? You never know, you just might enjoy it.",962150400,35,2323,4.6
1094726,1,6305958041,"This movie is really one of a kind. You could almost think this is a tribute to ol' Ed Wood. All SF effects are terribly underdone, badly computer animated or totally cut out of the movie. (Can it be the same team  that made the effects in Air force one?) The ending of the movie leaves you  with a bad taste in your mouth..",962150400,,324,4.046875
1094727,5,6305958041,"Ok I know there are those out there who said that this movie was dull and boring.  Well I have to be honest and say I found it quite the opposite.  I am of the opinion that Science Fiction fans should not rate Science Fiction  movies.  They just don't get it sometimes.  Its hard to compete with the  action Science Fiction of Star Wars or even my own beloved Star Trek.  But  I have put science fiction movies that make you think at the top of the  list.  Imagine going to the red planet and finding evidence that might lead  to permanent human settlemant on Mars.  Only to discover later that you  have returned to the place where your species originated?  What would you  do, and how would you react.  These are the questions faced by Gary Sinise  and his crew.  The ending is not, what some have told me, unbelievable.  In  fact it is very possible.  If you want good special effects and feeling of  realy flying to Mars then watch this movie if you haven't already.  If you  want a movie that will move you, and actually make you think for about two  hours and give you a new perspective on life then by all means watch it.  The acting is good, the effects great, the music moving.  And don't be  suprised if you feel like a little Kubrick (who directed 2001: A Space  Oddyssey) has been thrown into the mix.  Oh and by the way, check your  inhibitions at the door when you watch this movie. Take it for what it is  and enjoy it.",962064000,4,1434,4.235074626865671
1094728,2,6305958041,"Mission to Mars has the ability to both satisfy your craving for decent science fiction while at the same time have you go sprinting into the  bathroom to throw up your dinner. I have never seen a film in my life that  has so many genuinly good elements to it, while at the same time being so  cliched and just down right terrible.
The plot is simple enough: Don  Cheadle and his gang of astronaut cronnies dissapear under mysterious  circumstances on Mars. Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise are the men assigned to  bravely go to their rescue. These two are the biggest walking cliches  around. Frankly I'm stunned that two such good actors as Robbins and Sinise  would take roles that are so obviously garbage. Sinise especially... He  plays a man who is still mournful over the loss of his wife (like we care)  and this trip into space is going to be his redemption. That's just  lame.
Along the way one of the crew members is forced to kill himself for  the good of the other astronauts. This is typical American bravado that  makes the audience laugh not feel roused by its heroic sentiment.
The  holes, the glaring flaws are so bad, so contrived you wonder if a two year  old was responsible for writing this film after repeated viewings of  Armageddon. Fortunately it's not all bad. The sci/fi aspect of the film  about life on Mars is quite ingenious. The special effects are also to be  commended. Unfortunately it is not enough to save this film from the  Hollywood mire. I live for the day when Hollywood creates another space  movie that is actually intelligent and not just full of bluster.",962064000,2,1597,4.575971731448763
1094729,4,6305958041,"This movie starts out just like a 2010 version of Apollo 13 (Gary Sinise again), except the characters seem too modernized for the new millenium and are not written very well  (characters are cliches).  After all that, our  brave crew leaves to rescue a stranded team on Mars.  This is when the  movie gets fun, with a lot of action scenes and some very tense moments.  This movie is directed well, it definately pulls you in, unfortunately it  spits you out at the end.  In other words, the first 80% of the movie does  a great job setting you up for the climax, but then we are let down by an  unimaginative and unbelieveable, somewhat stupid ending.  After it is all  over, you may be sitting there unsatisfied, but most of the movie is still  great, so it is overall pleasing.  I believe this movie, however, will lose  its flavor after repeated viewings.
The DVD has some nice features, with  an OK movie.
Reccomended.",961977600,24,923,4.536585365853658
1094730,1,6305958041,This was one of THE WORST movies I've ever seen.  It's not even worth the  rental fee.  Don't waste your money!,961718400,,111,4.190476190476191
1094731,2,6305958041,"I saw mission to mars in the movies and I must say that I really wanted to like this movie. But exiting the movie it just felt as if I just wasted my money seing it. The movie felt as if it was only half finished and not  completed yet. Go buy 2001, 2010 instead or perhaps Contact with Jodie  Foster wich is a way better film than mission to mars.",956188800,3,348,3.887323943661972
1095020,4,6305958041,"Good movie.  Gary Sinise and Don Cheadle give solid performances as do the rest of the well-known cast.  The problem lies in the story.  Compelling dramatic incidents designed to illicit strong emotions don't bear close scrutiny.  In other words, these moments are based on contrived, improbable, and inexplicable choices and scenarios.  For instance, a superior life form needing to protect its equipment from curious, primitive beings by a sort of bomb that can be triggered by the wrong kind of probing.  Why not a cloaking device? Even worse, the scope of the movie.  It's all over the place.  From a Louisiana backyard party to infinity and beyond.  I still give it four stars because of the acting, as well as the somewhat intriguing story of the aliens.  Worth it if you like movies about spaceships and Mars.",1516665600,,816,4.890510948905109

1095028,4,6305958041,"This is a rescue mission to find out what happened to the first crew on mars. If they get there, what are they about to find?

I think of this movie as a combination of:

""Contact"" (1997) only they kept on going.

""Close Encounters of The Third Kind"" (1977) Martian style

""Rocketship X-M"" (1950) with a message

It has good actors Gary Sinise (helped rebuild schools in Iraq), Tim Robbins among others. I did not see any strings holding the spaceship up. The only thing that I found negative is the VHS version has 20 plus minutes of commercials on the front end. You forget what you put in by the time it starts (if you do not wander off).

They can barely hold it together.  Did they forget the psychological testing in their training.  In far too many scenes the drama is interrupted, in our house, by the collective rolling of eyes - pleading with them to keep it together.  We really like the concept, and the historical aspect as well.  If only astronauts were more professional in 2033.",1496793600,,509,4.8604651162790695

1095337,4,6305958041,"The year is 2020.  The first mission to mars is launched the crew is getting ready at a last party with their friends and family. The team is on Mars and they find a crystalline structure  that they believe is made of water. They travel to the site and the sensors indicate it is made of metal. As they scan the mountain a huge sand storm surrounds the mountain and three of the astronauts are at the site are killed. When the storm is over an massive metal sculpture of an alien face is exposed.  A rescue team is sent to find and help the survivor, if he is still alive.

This is a realist  representation of what a mission to Mars might be like at some parts of the mission and in other aspects its just not feasible.  The film has good a good cast but the script and scenarios that they put them through is crazy.  There is a good story buried in the film and I still like it but I am easily entertained with Sci-Fi.

Overall it is a reasonable film to watch but not first class. The special effects are good. It is between a 3.5 to 4 star film. I liked the cast and so I'll make is a 4 star film.",1487635200,,1101,4.018348623853211

1095339,2,6305958041,"The first two thirds of this movie are great, but the last one third is terrible.

2001, Mission to Mars and Pronetheus all are about the same thing - beings that created us and the human response when they discover this.

I think 2001 works because it does not try to depict our creators or go into detail about how they did create us.  It falls back on a like of LSD imagery.

Prometheus and Mission to Mars make the mistake of trying to examine the creatures and their motives.

I walked away feeling disappointed and saying to myself, ""how trite.""

However, Mission to Mars is a complete waste of the stellar talents of the director and of the extremely capable cast. The writing is slipshod and amateurish. The grand concept, if you will - is a very old one in SF, and who knows - perhaps one that will be bolstered by evidence if we ever get a manned mission to Mars. But the script, oh my Gawd, is riddled with cliches, stupid one liners and generally unfettered stupidity. Here is a suggestion - when you are trying to write a hard SF script, maybe you should spend some money hiring actual scientists as consultants to clean up the more obvious scientific mistakes in the script.

If you want to know where the screenwriter of recent very well received The Marian got his ideas from... ripped them off... stole them... apparently... see this movie and  The Red Planet  and then re-watch again the much later The Marian; unless The Martian is from an earlier book which I doubt.... if not then how he got away with stealing movie PRIME ideas I don't know.

Still for different reasons all 3 movies are  good and The Red Planet is quite good from a human dynamic stand point and fro pure scifi invention.
To answer another commenter's question... the reason that this film did not get good reviews was Tim Robbins politics. They are not mine but the fact is that the Necon side of the Jewish people in Hollywood wanted him taken down.",1453161600,,823,4.571428571428571

1096310,2,6305958041,The last 30 minutes remind me of some of the first movies on HBO I saw as a teen. Remember Black Hole by Disney? So about that level. Interesting. The remainder of the film was so bad I didn't think I would be able to get through it all. I kept watching just because I was floored by all the good reviews. How anyone could possibly rate this as spectacularly great as some did is beyond me. It is watchable if you are a kid. Other than that I wouldn't waste my time on it. I love old 50's Sci Fi and this can't even match up to some of the worst of those. Granted I only appreciate a few of the early Sci Fi as great. Most are camp. This isn't camp it is just bad. I had watched The Martian which I love and was looking for another Sci Fi film when I saw this one. I hadn't heard of it before. Now I know why! I only gave it the extra star because of the last 30 minutes which as I said reminded me of some of the 80's Disney Sci Fi. Don't bother!,1452384000,,947,3.8121827411167515

This one to me just feels more real, the characters actually have lives and backstory, the whole mission control structure is much more apparent and built out, and it doesn't throw a lot of unnecessary over the top action/fight scenes in your face (which Red Planet basically revolves its plot around). Watch this if you are looking for a movie all about science, exploration, and life out there; watch Red Planet if you would rather watch another blockbuster smash movie with muscled military goon characters and fighting with only a hint of true sci-fi.",1432944000,2,646,4.725663716814159

1097156,5,6305958041,"I have always liked this film and it confirms what I decided about most critics a long time ago. Their likes don't match mine very often and therefore I will watch a movie sans their opinions.  This is a movie with a heart.. I am always moved by the ending. Unlike most science fiction movies, the science is believable. Critics panned this film but liked ""Gravity"" which irritated me with it's scientific inaccuracy. No professional Astronaut would waste his suits reaction mass jerking around like George Clooney did.

The cast of ""Mission to Mars"" do a great job of making the film work. I have always enjoyed the weightless dancing scene with Astronaut Woody and his wife to Van Halen's ""Dance the Night Away"". Woody says ""This is my last chance to be graceful, once we get to Mars and gravity again, it's back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt."" I can feel the love Woody has for his wife. Strong enough to cause him to commit suicide in space to prevent her from killing herself in a rescue attempt that he knew was doomed to failure.

The ending has a nice twist, with the Martians being our ancestors, having seeded Earth after Mars is rendered uninhabitable by an Asteroid strike millions of years ago. It is always a possibility that we could suffer a similar fate from a wandering piece of space junk.  If for this reason and no other, it is a tragedy that our space program has pretty much gone dormant as regards Human manned space exploration.  Very short sighted. I go along with the statement in the movie ""Interstellar"" that we should think of Interstellar travel in terms of survival of the species.

I rate this as a superior piece of Science Fiction film making  Entertaining, suspenseful and intellectually stimulating.",1428796800,,1749,4.696078431372549

Since, I take it, this is supposed to be a somewhat realistic premise of how we will travel to and explore Mars, I find safety procedures were not written into the story. Even the design of the ship, aft of the rotating section, is questionable from a safety point of view. There isn't even an emergency lifepod.

After we watched it we understood why. They killed off the best actor 'Andy Dufresne' (Tim Robbins) too early. Most of it was too unreal as well. Your early indication of that was when the first astronauts on Mars just stood there while a menacing dirt funnel slowly approached them, and then sucked them up. LOL. Really? It never crossed the director's mind that maybe his actors should turn and run from it at some point? He missed that and so much more.

With all due respect to the film Gravity and the actors and work that went into it, it is a highly overrated - hyped - film about basically nothing and doesn't go anywhere, and the so-called special effects in a weightless environment are not so special.  Authentically showing movement in a weightless environment is old-hat.  It was superbly done as far back as Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey and repeated many times over by other lessor films, even B-rated Sci-Fi films. 3-D of course adds a special dimension to experiencing the space environment so perhaps it was 3-D that made Gravity ""special"".  However, this is not a review of Gravity.  Neither is it a review of Mission to Mars.  But I have seen both films and I've actually seen Mission to Mars at least twice and would easily be able to watch it again unlike Gravity which I will never watch again and will gladly sell my Blu-ray of it.

The script is exceedingly poor, dialogue is stiffly delivered, the dramatic moments are so forced they're laughable, sound editing is the worst I have ever heard in a modern film, the characters are cardboard, and inconsistent special effects create a bore-fest beyond compare.

Let's see now - 3 out of 4 crewmembers are reported dead by a panicked survivor, and what does our intrepid rescue crew do? Why they dance in zero G to Van Halen, that's what.

Jerry O'Connell is the most annoying actor to appear in a Hollywood production in recent memory - just awful.

Everything in this movie is so exceedingly bad, it is reminiscent of the worst sci-fi B-movies of the 50's. At least with those pictures, we knew exactly what we are getting into. MISSION TO MARS pretentiously pretends to be a work of art, but instead it is nothing but a farce. I've seen low budget webisodes that are produced better than this drek.

I wouldn't pay .05 cents for this DVD - it's not worth the space it would occupy on my shelf.

1098249,4,6305958041,"Universally panned when released, I find myself in the minority in liking this flick.

Sentimental and brazenly superficial - okay, I'll cop to those accusations. But how different is that from any number of romantic films? And let's be blunt, this is in fact a romantic film. The only difference is that the object of said romance is a planet. And, perhaps, something much more.

Opens with the first manned mission to the fourth globe in our solar system. All seems to be going as planned and the crew has seemingly accomplished humankind's greatest achievement in space exploration - they've landed on Mars. Suddenly, they encounter what may be the first confirmed volcanic activity on the planet - a harbinger of life.

But is it?

Terrifying, amazing, and unimaginable.

Without warning - all communications with Earth is wiped out.

Having lost contact with the four-person crew, mission control presumes that their first team is dead. A rescue impractical given the speed of our technology. Even if the back-up team were to launch immediately, it takes 1.5 years to get there. No, rescue is pointless. The second team is given the task of finding out what happened, that's it. Autopsy the first mission and report back.

Gary Sinise plays Astronaut James McConnell, the original leader of the first team. But the unexpected death of his wife during training, and his understandable emotionally unstable condition, forced Control to place him on the back-up squad. Despite spending the last decade training to be one of the first humans to explore the red planet - he had to watch from the sidelines.

The emergency means he's being put back into the line-up. But is he stable enough for this arduous task? Questions remain about his ability and objectivity. Does the recent tragic past cloud his vision - or does it give him insight to something much more important than the mission?

Murphy's Law seems to dog these crews.

Just like the first mission, the back-up crew is dogged by bad luck.

Struck by micro-meteorites, their interplanetary spacecraft explodes, nearly killing everyone onboard and derailing the second mission as well. An insane ad hoc plan is hatched - but it means one of the four astronauts will have to sacrifice themselves in order for the others to live.

Difficult choices are made. Each explorer following his or her own destiny.

The survivors all go home - but not everyone returns to Earth.

An entertaining, if again sentimental, journey of discovery.",1392508800,,2490,4.968674698795181

1098253,5,6305958041,"This movie is seriously underrated. Most people, me included,  just follow the bandwagon.  I resisted it for awhile. I mean, look at the ratings. I thought that so much consensus as to its mediocrity had to be deserved. Surely, so many ""film critics"" are right.  But then I watched the movie. What were they thinking? I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Never trust a critic implicitly. Form your own opinions. If everyone else says something sucks, watch it anyway.

This movie didn't perform to many peoples' expectations. First of all, it neglected the whole initial space flight--the very first manned Mars voyage. Boom! suddenly they're there on Mars. In our first glimpse of the planet, Don Cheadle is suddenly shown pickaxing a martian rock formation. He's been there for months. This movie is more interested in showing the human interactions when people are cooped up in a small spacecraft for 6 months together. This focus heightens the realism.

Keep in mind that this this is NOT an action movie in the traditional sense. This is probably the reason for its low ratings. Too much talking for an action movie and too much action for a drama.

It's interesting the dichotomy in the reviews show even numbers of polar opposites.  One could say half ""get it"" and the other half don't, but I think it comes down to personality types.  There are those who don't like movies unless they are fully based in reality and contain all the right structures (and there's nothing wrong with that) and there are those who enjoy ""filghts of fancy"" (nothing wrong with that either).  I enjoy both types, and Mission to Mars is a film that has a blend of reality and fantasy so is pretty much guaranteed to tick off anyone who enjoys mainly one end of the spectrum or the other.

But even a few good special effects and a crew of intrepid A-List actors like Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle and Connie Nielsen can't rescue Mission to Mars from being one of the worst science fiction movies of all time.

Poor direction launches this film into an erratic orbit somewhere between 2001: A Space Odyssey and Lost in Space. Meanwhile, swarms of cliches, chunks of hackneyed dialogue, and fitful bursts of bad science punch huge gaping holes in the credibility of this space clunker. Whatever willing suspension of disbelief audience members may have possessed at liftoff will have leaked out with the space-ships fuel by the time the crew of Mars II finally touches down on the Red Planet.

The final sequence of the movie involves a time lapse glimpse of the evolution of life on earth which almost makes the unbearable awfulness of the rest of the production worthwhile. Unfortunately this is presented by a CGI character which is one of the most breathe-takingly-hokey-special-effects I have ever seen. This movie was made in 2000 and this character looks like somethingout of a 1970s children's show. It's hard to feel awe and wonder when your tour guide to the mysteries of the universe looks like Gumby. Brian De Palma has crafted some very good films in his time.

Sound, as in all the movies today, is really up and down as if you are in a theater with great sound quality instead of watching a flatscreen TV.

1098558,1,6305958041,"Some guys with money thought it would be fun to produce a movie about a mission to Mars. With enough cool special effects what could go wrong? In a word, everything.

I felt embarrassed for the well-known actors in this movie who had to speak some of the most stilted dialogue I've ever heard. The special effects were so-so: they don't compare to what you've seen in old classic films like 2001 A Space Odyssey or the original Star Wars.

The story is as bad as the dialogue. The only way to explain is to drop a couple of major spoilers. If you plan to watch this movie even with all the well-deserved one-star reviews, stop reading now if you don't want spoilers.

A billion years ago Mars was home to a very advanced race of people. They knew how to build ships that could travel faster than light, but one day their planet was destroyed by a meteor. No problem - they sent millions of pods filled with DNA all over the universe, including Earth. In the event that any of their human descendants visited their dead planet they built a giant mask on the Martian surface, that served both as a museum of their history and as a self-guided ship that presumably would take you where thay had rebuilt their civilization in another galaxy. All of this sounds hokey enough, but it's not nearly the worst parts. This mask I've mentioned wants you to answer a question it is asking, as the price of admission to all the cool stuff inside. If you provide the wrong answer to the question, or if you don't realize it's asking a question, a ""monster"" comes out of the mask and kills you. No explanation is ever given for why it does this. It doesn't seem to be a protective action, because it's not as if giving a ""wrong answer"" is an act of aggression. In any case, this is how the first Mars mission is destroyed, except for one man. For reasons unknown the ""monster"" allows one man to survive. This man manages to survive on Mars inside of a small tent, with a few plants providing plenty of oxygen, food and heat. Amazing! Then there is the rescue mission, and of course they figure out that a question is being asked and of course they answer it correctly, and of course the mask is super friendly from that point on. It's all so ridiculously lame and completely derivative of other movies.

Bottom line: This movie needs a rescue mission of its own. Or better yet, don't try to rescue it, just let it go.",1376956800,5,2402,4.403153153153153

1098647,1,6305958041,"""Mission to Mars"" is a prime example of a sci-fi movie that thinks it is a LOT smarter than it actually is.

Specifically, it is a movie that tries to combine the stark realism of ""Apollo 13"" with the fantasy-science of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Unfortunately, it fails at being either by trying to be both -- we get long stretches of scientifically-plausible filler, followed by a sharp left turn into woo-woo too-advanced-to-explain-to-the-audience alien stuff.

In 2020, the first manned mission to Mars is launched, led by Luke Graham (Don Cheadle).  But the astronauts find a mysterious rock formation, and a whirlwind immediately pops up and kills everyone except Luke, who sends a panicked message back to the World Space Station.  So a rescue mission is quickly thrown together, including Co-Commander Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise), who was originally supposed to lead the Mars mission.

But the mission goes horribly wrong before they even get to Mars, when the ship is blasted by tiny asteroids, which leave one of their number dead. The survivors barely manage to land on Mars, but they lose their ship in the process. The only person left on the base is a half-crazed Luke, who reveals a shocking find on Mars' surface: a giant stone face.

The biggest problem with ""Mission to Mars"" is that at least 80% of it is filler. Just filler. The introduction to the families we will never see again? Filler. The whole asteroid-impact-in-space? It has nothing to do with the main plot. The incredibly melodramatic death of a main character we barely know? Contributes nothing. Without the padding, this movie would be half an hour long.

Additionally, this whole movie feels like it started as ONE kind of sci-fi movie, and then got derailed into another. The first half's approach is ""Apollo 13 on Mars,"" right down to starring Gary Sinise as a guy who didn't make it onto the first mission. We have a slow, careful, scientifically plausible approach with a home base and realistic perils. Yes, there is a standard sci-fi threat on Mars, but it's left ambiguous.

Then... the plot derails itself into Giant Martian face, mysterious artifacts, and the oh-so-dramatic history of Mars. Suddenly the space station and its Russian commander -- who was built up as a significant character -- are utterly forgotten. It clearly wants to become ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but merely having mysterious artifacts and a computer that sounds like a pedophile do not make it so.

And without revealing too much about the final revelations, ""Mission to Mars"" ends up feeling like a clumsy prequel to ""Prometheus."" The final scenes are crammed with so much wretched Hollywood science and gaping plot holes that your head might explode. It's pretty clear that nobody making the movie knew anything about DNA, and massive questions (why didn't the Martians colonize the beautiful virgin planet right next door?!) are left unanswered because... woo, look at the mysterious technology!

It has a fairly talented cast, though, and Sinise and Cheadle manage to keep it from becoming completely boring. However, Tim Robbins is utterly wasted -- he has one good scene, which is absurdly melodramatic -- and the rest of the cast is either wooden (Connie Nielson) or hideously annoying (Jerry O'Connell).

""Mission to Mars"" is an utter failure -- mediocre acting, a ghastly tonal shift, and a climax that feels like it was vomited up by ""Prometheus."" And of course, LOTS OF FILLER.",1369267200,10,3455,4.980902777777778

This is what you get in Mission to Mars. How well or poorly it was executed is the subject of this review.

But to qualify my POV, here's a bit of background about science fiction over the past 50 years.

Once the science fiction film genre was about humanity using its intellect to make its way toward a utopian future. In the fifties, the future looked bright and exciting and something we all wanted to be a part of. But somewhere along the line science fiction films took a sharp turn. Now most films seem to be either about humanity working its way toward dystopia (Gattaca, THX 1138, 1984, etc.- some of these films are good, but almost all are depressing) or are just an idiot-fest (personally, I'm sick of space marines and films that qualify as science fiction because space is the backdrop - but are really just war or horror films, etc). I miss science fiction films that actually consider the word ""science"" as an integral part of their 'science' fiction stories, that have intelligent characters  in science-related fields (astronauts, scientists, engineers, etc), and that deliver an encouraging promise about our future.

When I watch Mission to Mars I'm in my happy place. It's a space adventure with intelligent characters, reasonable space travel science, and a cosmic revelation style ending. The film is filled with beautiful sci-fi imagery of Martian landscapes and white NASA-engineered spaceships (that aren't shaped like gun barrels, incidentally, or powered by sparkly magic). The characters face problems that require their astronaut training and engineering skills to solve. Performances are good.

I gave this film a 4 star rating. That's my heart speaking. My head knows it's more of a 3 star movie, but it's only because of a couple of problems.

One is the score. While the music itself (which is big and orchestral) is actually quite pretty, it's often telling a different story than that of the action. There are a few intrusive moments when I wish I had the capability of turning the score off and just enjoy the actors and action.

The biggest problem, however, is the handling of the cosmic ending. The film (which, granted, is a Disney movie) feels compelled to spell EVERYTHING out - which amounted to bad expository dialogue, spoken out-of-character, combined with melodramatic music and imagery. The ending would benefit from more opacity and less sentimentality. The revelation at the end isn't dumb, but it feels dumb because of its delivery.

Outside of these problems, which aren't trivial, it's an enjoyable and intelligent science fiction film and hopefully not the last of its kind.",1356307200,,2863,4.97489539748954

I have a theory why so many reviewers give it such low ratings.  The way the film portrays human origin, evolution, and development doesn't jibe with their biblical and religious traditional beliefs based on God and creationist stories.  What a pity.

1099021,4,6305958041,"""MISSION TO MARS"" begins in 2020 with the introduction of all the crew members and their families at a farewell celebration before the launch of NASA's Mars One spaceship. The Mars Two will launch a year later and relieve the first team. We'll get to know all the members and their backgrounds so we can sympathize as they die horrible and agonizing deaths. Sound exciting, right? Well you be the judge.
 The first team lands safely and the Martian landscape looks pretty convincing so after about a year of chipping away at rocks and probing our scientists finally have to investigate a strange looking object at the peak of a mountain. They point a radar at the thing and boost the power, they shouldn't had done that. All kinds of bad things begin to happen. Turns out the Martians left the security system on.
 A grainy static frizzy message is bounced off a Martian satellite to Earth for help and the Mars Two team has to rush and prepare a rescue mission. The weird thing is the ship is renamed the ""Mars Recovery"". Which I'm to understand means you're too late for a live rescue and it's now considered a recovery. You know,like in recovering bodies.
 Anyway, our heroes back on Earth take off to Mars and wouldn't you just know it, minutes before orbital insertion freaking meteoroids, pebbles in space that's going to really screw up the paint job on your new rocket ship. The good news is it's still under the sixty five million mile warranty. Bad news is they fix most of the holes except the most important one on an external fuel line and blow their ship up. Don't give up hope, after a major sacrifice and we go through the sad scene, we find most of our guys safely down on Mars. The wife of the poor guy that sacrificed himself seems to have recovered and she's okay now. If we learn anything from this movie it's that husband and wife teams are not a good idea on long trips in space or in my case the mall.
 They find the sole survivor and repair the Mars One ship but before they return to Earth they have to tempt fate once more and go poking around that old Martian relic.
 They figure out the message left by the ancient people and are shown the secrets of creation. Turns out Creationists and Big Bang Evolution theorists were both wrong and we lose another astronaut. Well not so much as lose but he doesn't go back to Earth. He was pouting all through the movie anyway because his wife became ill and died while they were training at NASA for the first Mars' mission, blah, blah, blah.
 Okay, I'm a huge fan of just about anything to do with Mars so I'm going to give this movie four stars just for the background and effects. I think it's worth a look. I also recomend ""Red Planet"" offered here on AMAZON at a great price and you don't even have to leave home to buy it.

Extraordinarily, it is deemed wise and reasonable to launch a rescue mission.  The fact that it will take three months or more to reach Mars [and get back] is completely glossed over.  Therefore, even buying into the loco scenario, four people--and tens of billions of dollars--are risked to save one life.  No man left behind carried to an unbelievable level.

Our lone survivor has been able to hold out via a hydroponic garden that provides him with plenty of oxygen and food but I never heard where all the water and fertilizer would come from to support such a hydroponic effort.  No matter.  It gets more interesting.  A huge Martian structure is discovered that--after finding the secret to unlock this alien 'safe'--invitingly opens itself.  Therefore--OF COURSE--three of our four explorers walk into the opening which might just be a trap.

Why send three into potential danger when one would have sufficed?  We never learn.  That's the way it is with drama.  The more at risk, the more the excitement.  It all ends well, of course, which is the way it is with Hollywood.",1347062400,2,1229,4.926829268292683

There is a lot of dragging tedious scenes of four astronauts in their space ship on the Mars voyage, after we see the family interactions of them as they prepare for their trip.
This half was a real yawn fest for me.

The second half, after they land on Mars becomes more and more interesting, as a giant face is discovered which holds some surprises.  The one thing that makes this a bit sub-par is the robot rover wandering around on Mars which clearly is a toy.  Otherwise it seems fairly realistic, aside from the fact that during weightlessness in the spacecraft, their hair stays remarkaably smoothed down to their heads.

Still, the storyline picks up towards the end with a very satisfying plot turn.  I appreciate the effort that was made to display some realistic looking scenery of Mars, along with special effects built around our current knowledge of Mars and space travel. It made this a better movie than older sci-fi movies that lack credibility due to misinformation about how Mars looks.  It was just unfortunate that the Mars rover they showed was so poorly done, but the gravely soil and mountains looked realistic.

I enjoyed the second half of this movie and liked the realism as well as the story as it unfolded.  If you are a Mars enthusiast as I am I think you will like this.",1345507200,,1546,4.568840579710145

1099217,4,6305958041,"Maybe a trifle too slanted toward the teckies, but otherwise a very good movie indeed.

Mars 1 gets there with not too much trouble, but then things go very wrong and very strange when a huge dust storm -- sort of a dust tornado or even sand worm (if you've read ""Dune"") rises out of an anomalous structure and grabs all the astronauts but one. One we saw explode inside the whirl, as if the air pressure inside was so low that the pressure inside his space suit was enough to explode him like a balloon in low atmosphere.

Mars 2 is thus refitted as a rescue mission, but suffers significant meteor damage on the way in, and makes it only by the most amazing ingenuity and the sacrifice of one of the crew. That whole sequence is worth the whole film, but there's more, much more.

So they find the one survivor of Mars 1, who has been marooned on Mars alone for a year, surviving because the ship included the makings of a greenhouse where he and the plants he grows have achieved a tiny ecosystem. But as he points out, it's one heck of a rescue mission that has no ship, no food or water, and is basically even more helpless than the castaway. Fortunately, what they did manage to bring along was the necessary part to repair his landing module and get back to earth.

But the crew must go and find out what that thing is over there that generated the giant sandstorm. And if you think I'm going to tell you, guess again. You'll just have to see the film. It's good. It's really very good, especially once we're on Mars. The technology parts to satisfy the geeks in the audience is mostly on earth and in an orbiting station.

Although there isn't much swearing, they do take God's name in vain several times, which is completely unnecessary. And the worst was near the end (at which time I turned it off): They teach people that aliens and evolution populated the earth...both are lies. God created all things, and for His pleasure they are and were created. Only God is worthy to receive glory and honor and power. Revelation 4:11.

The music score is awful, the script is painfully derivative, the acting is serviceable at best, and Thunderbirds (the Gerry Anderson Super-Marionation series) has better production and industrial design (for instance, when sending a ship to Mars, which is right next to the Asteroid Belt, and even has a couple of captured asteroids as moons, they design a ship with the fuel tanks on the OUTSIDE where they can be holed by meteoroids. Great! That's the ship I want to take to Mars...).

<....SPOILER....>

When the climax is reached and Tim Robbins has to choose to sacrifice himself to save the others, it's hard not to shout at him, begging him to remove his helmet and end it already.

By the time you reach the horribly sappy ending (What was Morricone THINKING by writing that awful child's-toy-piano theme!), all you feel like doing is shouting ""My God, it's full of stars"" and walking away from your television set in disgust. I'm just glad I didn't have to sit through it in a movie theater.

If there is one redeeming thing to this movie, it's that the big-budget effects are pretty incredible to see. It's just a shame that such knock-out effects went with such a clunker of a movie.

I just finished the movie Star Trek with Pine and Quinto and the crew for the second time last night.  Just to make sure. I am about as Trekie as one can get without actually dressing up and going to the conventions.  I own all the episodes of some of the shows.  So I like Star Trek.

1099326,4,6305958041,"I can certainly understand why this movie fared better overseas than in the US. This is a quiet film. There is intensity, but it results from tension - not from explosions or gunfire. Also, the film was made in 2000 but set in 2020. The ""look into the future"" aspects of the film can seem as quaint as pre-WWII era depictions of flying Studebakers.

However, the draw of this film is the characters. Don Cheadle does an excellent job of depicting the mental and emotional ramifications of isolation. Connie Nielsen's character has substance, giving her a rare opportunity to show that she is actually a good actor. Tim Robbins is not at his finest here, but he works well as the glue that holds the group together. Gary Sinise embodies the quiet grief of a man who has lost the love of his life. Jerry O'Connell plays Jerry O'Connell, but it is right for the film. And Armin Mueller-Stahl is outstanding in his supporting role - but strangely uncredited within the film.

The Walt Disney-ish music is a major distraction, as is the gratuitous dance scene. Moreover, the pseudo-scientific explanation of the film is highly dated, as we've learned much about DNA and the origins of life since the film was produced. But Mission to Mars is ultimately about love, friendship, and the human passion for adventure and exploration. Because of the strong characters and refreshing perspective of space flight, I give it four stars.",1309478400,,1423,4.8040816326530615
1099327,5,6305958041,"I saw this film the weekend it opened and thought it was great.  I then read and heard bad reviews, and wondered ""Did they see the same movie ?"".  I just watched it again on DVD last night (with Plasma and surround-sound, it may have been a better presentation than at the theater) and - again - thought it was great.  When I focus on the visuals in the film, I really feel that I am on a mission to Mars, as the sets, art design, and special effects are perfect.  The characters are seen to be in a weightless atmosphere and ... you really think they are.  In keeping with his trademark long continuous shots, Mr. DePalma has scenes in which the multiple characters move along a circular hallway (as in 2001) in one take.  Pretty cool.  So, I think the film itself depicts the conditions in space realistically.

I believe that what sets Science Fiction apart from just plain general fiction, is that the stories are designed to make you think.  And a good Science Fiction story presents that question in a good and believable plot.  This movie does that.  Yes, it presents a theory that is based on science rather than religion, but I do not believe the purpose was to be malicious.  Instead, it is a theory to make one think, discuss and argue for or against.  That is good, and should be accepted by all viewers, regardless of where your personal sentiments lie.  This film falls best in to the sub-genre of Science Fiction wherein one finds ""2001"", ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""Destination Moon"", ""Conquest of Space"" or ""Planet of the Apes"".  It is not overly action-packed (but does have action fitting to the story) and there are no lasers, phasers or space battles.  It is fiction based on science.

In short, do not be swayed by negative reviews.  You may not think it the best film ever, but you should not be disappointed.  The movie can be nitpicked, but so can ""Citizen Kane"", and after you have nitpicked it you should ask yourself ""Does that really take away from the presentation ?"".

The cast has done about a s good of a job as possible given a poor script, and poor direction.  As a sci-fi lover this is not the worst movie I have seen on the genre, but it does come close.  Still, the visuals can hold some attention and the overall message of not being the only beings in the world, does point to some signs of hope.  The script needed to be reworked (badly) and De Palmi never should have been allowed to direct...with the exception of Carrie, most of his direction has been a dismal flop....this is no exception.  So, I give it 3 stars, for the casts attempt to salvage an awful script with ""some"" ethos and to over come De Palmi's horrible direction and action.",1304899200,2,941,4.271186440677966

Ok, this is a Brian De Palma film, let's establish that right off the bat. To appreciate (read ""get"") De Palma, one must be exposed to and appreciate films by filmmakers ranging from Michelangelo to Fellini, from Kubrick to Hitchcock, from Copolla to Welles, from Hawks to Capra, from Donen to Lelouch, from Scorcese to Godard, from Wilder to Lynch. Filmmakers who pioneered the art of visual storytelling, relying on great, strong, awe-inspiring, jaw dropping visuals coupled with good solid acting and a very enticing Human story; and not have to be ""talked to death"" with dialogue overflowing in EVERY scene. You have to, as a viewer, read facial expressions, eye movement, guess what's being said, guess what's going on, question where you may be in the movie as far as plot, keeping you almost in a state of utter confusion only to wrap everything together at film's end in a way that will have you feeling like the rug has just been pulled out from under you because it's done in such utter climatic fashion.

This film starts with a De Palma trademark crane tracking shot that goes on for the entire length of credits, starting with a rocketship launch that reveals itself to be only a bottle rocket as the film opens showing us that all is not what it appears to be from the start, and a back yard barbeque and all the characters that we'll need to know in this ten minute take. Then the shots of Mars, and the way scenes are done via telescreen depicting communication between the astronauts on Mars and the Space Station. The CGI in this film are amazing! Finally a great movie that uses CGI to serve the story instead of the other way around. The Martian Storm Funnel scene alone is worth viewing the film over and over for. The stunning way De Palma shows us a 'vortex' scene in so many different ways, or creating a 'vortex' mood in so many scenes. Ranging from the M&M's Phil (played brilliantly by the very talented Jerry O'Connell) has displayed as his ideal perfect woman to another scene where the M&M's are spilled and floating in a DNA form, to the scene where the micrometeroids hit the ship, and the Dr. Pepper and the leaking fuel are showing us the same DNA vortex. Or scenes showing the spaceship done in a whirling fashion. And I won't spoil the ending by saying that it is nothing short of an AWESOME vortex climax that will leave you breathless.

This is a De Palma film that I was expecting to go in a different direction than it took when I first saw it when it first hit video. As a matter of fact, I let myself be led to believe that the film was building toward something sinister, like Tobe Hooper's ""Invaders From Mars"", or Philip Kaufman's ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"", between what was happening on screen visually along with composer Ennio Morriconne's AWESOME score. So, when the four main characters meet the Martian alien, I initially hated this movie as it continued on from there until the final minute or two. Then, the final minute or two Paul Hirsch's edited flashback scene pops up from out of nowhere and I was stunned; and the other part of the ending all worked for me. I immediately watched it again as soon as I could, and I've loved it even more every time I've viewed it, which is very often.

I feel that the scene with Maggie at the end is one of the most powerful, emotional things I've seen in a film in a long time. And something that I believe that any married man would relate to. Especially one who has maybe lost his wife, and would give practically anything to have her back again. That to me was what this film was about, one man's voyage ""Home"", a journey (or odyssey, if you will) to the residence within the heart, where we may find eternal bliss.

I thought Paul Hirsch's editing has never been better, especially on a De Palma film, than in that final scene! And, then when I went back and watched the film again, I loved every second of it, even some of the scenes I initially thought were a bit ""hokey"" because I realized the hokey dialogue in some scenes is really essential, because sometimes that is how we as people talk. But that is what  I like in this, that the screenplay is kind of ""weak"", the actual ""story"" is told visually by De Palma's deft camera. When you realize the whole story revolves around Maggie and about going ""Home"", you may even realize why the Martian Spirit is crying a single tear when She appears (it's not just because She sensed the pain of their journey, and their pain of losing a friend along the way. She is also crying a tear for all Humanity).

As for filmmaking techniques that I hinted at before, now that I've mentioned Maggie (SO perfectly played by the great Kim Delaney), a character that's not only seen but one time in the film (well, twice counting the flashback at the end), yet a character that is definitely no SMALL character; as there never seem to be any of those in any of De Palma's films - even the SMALLEST of roles are also most times some of the most key roles- is shown to us in a movie within a movie within a movie, and to me this movie is worth owning just for scenes like that alone, let alone all the other NUMEROUS scenes that are just awe-inspiring to any film student today.

Yes, there's maybe some non-perfect dialogue, and/or dialogue in a scene that didn't need it, but overall this is a solid masterpiece of sci-fi! I would easily rank this on the same level as Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", Spielberg's ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", George Lucas' first 3 ""Star Wars"" films, or ""Contact"". No gory ""Men In Black"" type aliens, thank God. This is a lot more ""cerebral"" than those. And, I am sure that is why it was so heavily panned when it came out, because it wasn't one of those type films, which were over-saturating the market back then. This is a simple story about a lonely widower that only wants to go ""Home"", even if it means leaving the world you're in now to get there, this is an AWESOME version of any ""Odyssey"" story ever told! Highly recommended!
Thank you! :>)

1099408,4,6305958041,"While I cannot say that `Mission to Mars' is a total success, I must admit (and I wish that more people would) that the film succeeds on many levels, most importantly on that of being a truly engaging and cinematically visceral accomplishment.  In fact, when seeing that this film garnered a Razzie nomination for Worst Direction, I'm baffled because De Palma's deft hand is what makes this film work to the extent that it does.

If anything it would be the second rate script that deserved the Razzie mention.

Yes, `Mission to Mars' has a lot going for it.  The sharp edits and focused direction help make each frame come to life for the audience.  The cinematography and the vivid special effects work wonders on the eyes and create moods intended for a deeper setting, something that De Palma works wonders with here.  In fact, above all else, this film is deeply memorable thanks to the imagery created.  I can still, quite vividly, remember sequences from my initial viewing, in the theater nearly twelve years ago.  Upon a recent viewing (yes, I did this for you Beany) I've only found those images cemented on my mind.  The acting presented is also serviceable, and at moments (especially within Gary Sinise, who is not an actor I am particularly fond of) the acting actually breathes fresh life into the films premise.

But it is that premise, or more specifically the way the script handles the premise, that ultimately fails this film.

The barrage of clich&eacute;s is bad enough, but the dialog is laughable in moments and the films staging is logically questionable.  I found myself baffled at some of the attempts to become prolific, inserting faux logic in an attempt to find credibility.  This film is far from the depth provided in other science fiction films, most notably `2001', the film from which `Mission to Mars' heavily borrows.  There are numerous films that attempt to draw that line between otherworldly existence and our own, but few understand the nuance depth needed to create something `ever-reaching'.

From a visual standpoint, `Mission to Mars' contains the goods, but when the film tries to hard to become something more than that it falls short.

I'd give it a B-.",1299801600,,2202,4.847593582887701
1099409,3,6305958041,"Brian DePalma's ""Mission to Mars"" usually inspires one of two polar opposite reactions from viewers: either it's outstanding, or it's unbearably awful. As is often the case, the truth lies somewhere in between. Although the plotline contains little original material, the script is poor and none of the acting performances come close to oscar material, the film has some minor strengths which make it worth seeing at least once.

M2M takes elements of the plotline from Clark and Kubrick's 1969 classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and reworks them into a near-future first-mission-to-Mars setting. Many of the scenes are reminiscent of ""2001"" especially the zero-gravity shots and the long, slow destruction of the rescue ship, with the four crew then drifting high above Mars in space suits: an episode of genuine dramatic tension which pays homage to the long scene of astronaut Dave Bowman's attempts to outwit the computer HAL in ""2001"". M2M plays out as if targeted at a young audience demographic (i.e. those who go to the movies a lot), so Van Halen stands in for Richard Bach and Strauss on the soundtrack and the dialog is dumbed down to the lowest denominator so even someone who's had a few beers can get it. The final scenes give cinematic voice to the widespread speculation that the enormous upward-facing rock ""face"" situated in the Cydonia Crater published on NASA's photographs might indeed be an artificially-created artefact and evidence of previous intelligent habitation of Mars.

One of the problems with this movie seems to be that it falls between different classes of sci-fi and doesn't really know if it's fish or fowl, so to speak. Its upbeat enlightened-aliens-from-ancient-times theme is reminiscent of the original 1950 ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (justifiably seen as a classic) and Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" - especially the ending. It's probably best to suspend disbelief and see the message of M2M as belonging to this strain of the genre. The discovering-remains-of-advanced-ancient-alien-civilization-on-distant-planet theme was pioneered as far back as Fred Wilcox's ""Forbidden Planet"" in 1956, has been revisited many times since and forms the cornerstone of the plot of M2M. The realization of this theme is unfortunately trite and unconvincing, with pretty doe-eyed androgynous CGI ancient alien demonstrating the seeding of life on Earth millions of years ago before departing for destination unknown elsewhere in the galaxy (why didn't they just move to Earth and settle there? - not answered).

On realization of scientific detail and on representation of Mars as currently known, the film scores a fairly high 7/10 due to advisory input from NASA. Realistic portrayal of space travel within the confines of current technology know-how: 6/10 (you don't stop in space if your fuel runs out, guys - you keep moving until you connect with another object). Acting performances 4/10 at most; character development around 3/10. Dramatic tension a respectable 5/10. Originality maybe 2/10 (the face-in-Cydonia speculation has featured as the central theme in no other movie to date but the rest of the plot is derivative). Overall, 5/10.

So in summary, not as bad as some claim and not great either. If you don't expect either the haunting mystique of ""2001"", the schlock-shock of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" series or the wondrous and positivist message of Spielberg's CE3 but accept M2M as a hybrid which works well in parts, you'll enjoy it for what it is: an OK movie which misses the mark of greatness by some margin, but can be good entertainment nevertheless.",1293926400,,3621,5.195205479452055

1099413,3,6305958041,"This is solid, character-based hard sci-fi.  There is a mission to Mars that ends mysteriously, so a rescue crew is sent.  What they encounter is very well carried off, tantalizingly strange and a grand conception.  It got me to believe it and feel some sense of wonder, which is what sci-fi is for imho.  The characters are also very strong, with truly wonderful actors, in particular Sinise.

That being said, there are many static moments in the film.  It isn't tightly plotted, and there are several subplots that don't always fit, though they are well conceived and realistic.  THere is a 20-minute sequence, for example, of a transport crisis that develops and it is way way too long and largely unrelated to what later transpires.  The effects are also not always so great, though most of the time they are good enough.  Finally, as revealed at the end the basic idea didn't really surprise me, however well it carried off.

Overall, this is pretty good, but I will not want to re-watch it and delight in the details like I do the films that I think are truly great, like Minority Report or the Bourne Identity.",1272758400,2,1118,4.658163265306122
1099414,3,6305958041,"There is much to like about this movie, despite the cheesy dialogue. For one thing, the special effects are impressive, though perhaps not exactly state of the art for the year it was made (2002). And there are some great original plot ideas, like the rescue mission to Mars to find out what happened to the first mission... no, wait, Ray Bradbury did that in The Martian Chronicles. But how about the Martians leaving behind a big monument to be discovered when the Earthlings became evolved enough to... no, Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick did that in 2001. And the astronaut getting separated from his tether and flung into... nope, that was also 2001.

Actually, this movie has more than a few similarities to 2001. There are the space suit helmets, the big white room, the one astronaut leaving the ship and going on a great voyage... Okay, it's a LOT like 2001, The Martian Chronicles, The Angry Red Planet and a dozen other movies. But hey, that's the Brian dePalma style. He crafts ""homages"" to the movies of the great directors, which is how serious fans of the the cinema describe ripping off the works of other directors. Still, it's a fairly entertaining 114 minutes, and it's a lot better than most of the space movies of that era, like Asteroid and Meteor.

1099415,1,6305958041,"""Mission to Mars"" must be *the* most boring movie ever made. Not even The Face On Mars and a holographic space alien can save it. Even its competitor ""Red Planet"" (hardly a five star production) comes across as more of an action thriller compared to this uneventful and far too long mission impossible.

Besides, it's just not true that aliens from Elsewhere seeded us. That's one of the Devil's deceptions to keep people from reading their King James Bibles.

1) The story is very engrossing...yes, it is far-fetched, but this is why it is called science-fiction.
2) Realistic special-effects...The shots of the spacecraft and the CG terrain of Mars makes you feel like you are watching an actual NASA mission.
3) The soundtrack is one of the best I have heard in a movie...watch the end scene and you will see why.
4) Great acting by great actors: Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle...
5) It has very '2001' Kubrick-style cinematography throughout it.

Overall, I thought this movie was a delight to watch. In my opinion, it does not deserve all the one-star ratings that it got...it may not be a perfect sci-fi film to some people, but it is a well told fictional story that should be seen by all movie-lovers.

1099489,5,6305958041,"Editorial Reviews, by Jeff Shannon:
""If Brian De Palma directed Mission to Mars for 10-year-olds who've never seen a science fiction film, he can be credited for crafting a marginally successful adventure.""

It might be true, because 10-year-olds are more open-minded, unlike grown-ups who are jailed in prejudices and known-to-date facts, and assumptions that they are... wise. That is why most of grown-ups in Galileo time believed he was crazy because he had a different belief. It turned out he was right but he was mistakenly killed by a grown-up. There was a possibility that de Palma is right, and the 10-year-olds would be happily learning something. So don't kill de Palma, because he might be right, and open your mind, to learn something. If you don't like it, then just... ignore it, and walk away.

I happened to watch this movie last night and I must say it has been the best I have seen during this summer, even better than ""The Half Blood Prince."" The idea is amazing and I consider it one of the very true possibilities of the humankind (and other earth's species) appearance and existance. I should have watched this movie long time ago.

I am a Star Wars' fan, but, for some reason, I feel that this story has a firm connection to us - human, than Star Wars'. Don't get me wrong: Star Wars is always the #1 series of all time, to me, but it's just far far away from me, than this Mission to Mars, with those human heroes, not Jedi Knight, who are very close to me.

I have read reviews, and many of them pointed out the ""scientific mistakes,"" which, I consider irrelevant. There have been movies that people are unable to judge whether they are scientifically correct or incorrect, simply because they depict stories in the far, far future (or in long, long time ago), such as Star Wars. There have been movies that you can put aside logic, and even realism, of the plot, such as The Matrix, or X-Men, for the same reasons. Or, you have to ignore it and accept it. You just can't judge. It's not in our time.

""But, if the story falls into our time, then we should be able to make scientific judgment,"" you told me. Yes, I agree, and I agree that this movie seems not scientifically well thought. But science is not what this movie all about. I saw starship officers are still using touchscreen computers in Star Trek. I ignore it, though I believe those touchscreen machines would be extincted even in our time. ""Mission to Mars"" was about our root, or our past, our present, and our future.

The bottom line is the idea, and the idea of this movie is brilliant, an idea that makes you think. May be it was not Mars. May be it was somewhere else. Somewhere very far, like places and futures you have seen in Stargate Atlantis or SG-1, or Star Trek. It's just a matter of time to know who we are and where we came from, and how we might leave Earth... Pray, that when the time comes, we would be able to leave Earth.

And by the way, Armageddon was not a bad idea either. It could be scientifically imprecise and questionable, now, but still it is a possibility, in the future. I just wish that will not happen, but if it would, then I only hope there would be heroes and solutions just like we hoped in the movie.

I would not want to tell the story, it's for you to explore. But I could say there are beautiful scenes, heart touching moments, and surprises. Again, you would leave with thoughts and questions. You might even think about, your faith, like I do. It might be a little annoying, because it might asks you to search, for something. It's something worth to spend time with. I watched it on TV (yes, you laugh) but I will buy a DVD for my collection.

I have never written a review before. I, somehow, do not consider this piece a review because I believe I am NOT qualified as a reviewer by any mean. However, I feel the urge to share the idea. It's about time to think outside the box, uh, no, the Earth.

Yes, there are a few errors in science, but fewer than many films. On the whole it is quite realistic. You can quibble with it's ideas but they are bold and at least theoretically possible.

One of the frequent points they make is to claim this is the worst movie ever made, but it isn't that class of movie at all-it's very well done even if it's not your type of movie.

You will also note that for many of the one star reviewers, this is the only thing they have ever reviewed on Amazon. They have reviewed no other movies at all, despite the fact that many seem to be film buffs and compare this movie to other movies. So where are their other reviews? I suspect that someone who was in some way connected to this movie got annoyed and went on a campaign to trash it.

This is a really good SF movie. I rate it 5 stars but if you're really cranky and don't like SF that much, knock it down to 3 stars. But under no circumstances is this a one star movie.",1225497600,5,1660,4.145962732919255

*The DVD is of good video/sound quality.
*Includes a number of good special features; featurettes, commentary, production art gallery, DVD-ROM stuff, and the trailer.
*Quite a few excellent special effects.
*Good cameramanship.
*I thought that the story was great.  It presented an intriguing mystery (the Cydonian sphinx, which has been actually sighted on Mars' surface) and a clever solution to it.
*Characters are not bad.
*Music was not bad.

The Bad Things
*It is slowly-paced and has no real conflict.  It looks like most people find it too boring.
*Not for kids.  Even though it is rated PG, it does include one scene at the beginning that has some brief gnarly violence.

The Questionable Things
*Some people may find the film's final answer unbelievable, or perhaps even blasphemous (I thought it was interesting, though).  Could also be considered predictable.
*I swear, sometimes, it feels like this movie rips off ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" so much.  Style and production design are very similar.
*I didn't mind the writing or the acting, but lots of other people seem to find them disagreeable.

Despite the slow-pacing, I've always enjoyed this space opera for its neat special effects and its intriguing story.  Granted that ""2001"" is better in many ways, I think this film is more accessable and easier to follow.  I think it's great, and would reccomend it to anybody who is interested in space-opera type sci-fi.",1222473600,,1445,5.0548523206751055

1099719,5,6305958041,"Don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews. I consider this to be Brian DePalma's greatest work, especially since he was working in an unfamiliar genre. The best part about this is the casting, and the timely climax which does not tie up any loose ends. Indeed, they could have made a 'Mission to Mars 2' considering how the movie ended, but the fact that they haven't only makes me respect this movie more.

As you are aware, this about Mars Exploration, but the film really comes into its' own towards the end. A lot of people had problems with the depiction of the Martian, some calling it a mish-mash of every science fiction cliche, and some calling it just hideous and unlikable. I thought that the Martian actually worked. I mean, I liked its' eyes especially. The climax was the best as one of the astronauts decides to 'go where no man has gone before' and splits from the group to visit a totally new galaxy.

Granted, there are other movies with better special effects (even ""Lost in Space"" had better effects), but the movie has a heart and soul that you can't deny. No wonder it has gone on to become a cult hit on video and DVD, I am not surprised at all. It deserves all the recognition it can get.",1191110400,8,1213,4.434977578475336

1099723,4,6305958041,"Tim Robbins (Woody Blake) and Gary Sinise (Jim McConnell) star in this exciting and entertaining film about the first manned spaceflight to the planet Mars.

The mission is under the command of Luke Graham (played by Don Cheadle), and after six months of spaceflight, the group of astronauts finally lands on the red planet.  However, the Martian landscape proves to be most inhospitable, as some unseen force from beneath the surface of the planet unleashes its fury on the small band of astronauts.  Luke is the only survivor.  He somehow manages to send a cryptic and garbled last message to NASA describing the events which befell his group.

NASA immediately launches the Mars Recovery Mission, led by McConnell and Blake, to investigate the mysterious happenings and bring back survivors, if there are any.  Also along for the ride are Phil Ohlmyer (played by Jerry O'Connell), and Terri Fisher, Woody's wife, (played by Connie Nielsen).

During the flight, the ship encounters a micro-meteor shower, and the hull is breached.  Working quickly, Jim and Woody manage to seal the punctured hull (or so they thought), but when they begin their descent to the Martian surface, a tremendous explosion rocks the ship.  The crew is forced to abandon ship and try to reach a smaller scout ship which was inside the larger one.  Due to poor calculations, the astronauts must navigate in space with jet packs to reach the smaller ship.  Unfortunately, Woody overshoots the ship, but the others reach it safely and descend to the surface.

Once on Mars, the crew finds Luke and learns that he has made an amazing discovery; there is a large white face on the surface of the planet, but he doesn't know how it got there.  When the astronauts go to investigate, they find that many of the secrets of the solar system are hidden inside.  Will the crew make it back to earth safely?

This is a very good movie.  The acting, especially by Sinise and Robbins, is excellent.  I've always been a big fan of Gary Sinise and his movies, including ""Apollo 13"" and ""Forrest Gump"", and he's just as good in this movie.  Robbins gives a performance on par with his ""Bull Durham"" role.  The special effects are eye-popping, and the dance scene, complete with Van Halen's ""Dance the Night Away"", is one of the movie's best.

I recommend this movie very highly.  Science Fiction fans will be sure to enjoy the secrets that lie on the Martian surface.",1174953600,9,2428,4.788461538461538

1099725,5,6305958041,"Ok, this is a Brian DePalma film, let's establish that right off the bat. As I should've  pointed out in any of my other reviews of DePalma's films, to appreciate (read ""get"") DePalma, one must be exposed to and appreciate films by filmmakers ranging from Michelangelo to Fellini, from Kubrick to Hitchcock, from Coppolla to Welles, from Hawks to Capra, from Donen to Lelouch, from Scorcese to Godard. Filmmakers who pioneered the art of visual storytelling, relying on great, strong, awe-inspiring, jaw dropping visuals coupled with good solid acting and a very enticing Human story; and not have to be ""talked to death"" with dialogue overflowing in EVERY scene. You have to, as a viewer, read facial expressions, eye movement, guess what's been said, guess what's going on, question where you may be in the movie as far as plot, keeping you almost in a state of utter confusion only to wrap everything together at film's end in a way that will have you feeling like the rug has just been pulled out from under you because it's done in such utter climatic fashion.
This film starts with a DePalma trademark crane tracking shot that goes on for the entire length of credits, starting with a rocketship launch that reveals itself to be only a bottle rocket as the film opens showing us that all is not what it appears to be from the start, and a back yard barbeque and all the characters that we'll need to know in this ten minute take. Then the shots of Mars, and the way scenes are done via telescreen depicting communication between the astronauts on Mars and the Space Station. The CGI in this film are amazing! Finally a great movie that uses CGI to serve the story instead of the other way around. The Martian Storm Funnel scene alone is worth viewing the film over and over for. The stunning way DePalma shows us a 'vortex' scene in so many different ways, or creating a 'vortex' mood in so many scenes. Ranging from the M&M's Phil (played brilliantly by the very talented Jerry O'Connel)has displayed as his ideal perfect woman to another scene where the M&M's are spilled and floating in a DNA form, to the scene where the micrometeroids hit the ship, and the Dr. Pepper and the leaking fuel are showing us the same DNA vortex. Or scenes showing the spaceship done in a whirling fashion. And I won't spoil the ending by saying that it is nothing short of an AWESOME vortex climax that will leave you breathless (with maybe a few tears slipping down your cheeks), then laughing lightly as the other ship goes SHOOTING by into the vortex and the words THE END popping up, as they did in movies of yore.
Now, let me note that the reason I'm doing a plot summary the way I am is because that this is a DePalma film that I was expecting to go in a different direction than it took when I first saw it when it first hit video. As a matter of fact, I let myself be led to believe that the film was building toward something sinister, like Tobe Hooper's ""Invaders From Mars"", or Phillip Kaufman's ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"", between what was happening on screen visually along with composer Ennio Morriconne's AWESOME score. So, when the four main characters meet the Martian alien, which I now realize upon subsequent viewings is an Ancient Martian Spirit, I initially hated this movie as it continued on from there until the final minute or two. I even found myself telling my friend I was viewing this with : ""This s**ks! DePalma has finally made a movie that I HATE!"", then as I was speaking, the final minute or two Paul Hirsch's edited flashback scene pops up from out of nowhere and I was stunned; and the other part of the ending all worked for me. I immediately watched it again as soon as I could, and I've loved it even more every time I've viewed it, which is very often.
When you realize the whole story revolves around Maggie and about going ""Home"", you may even realize why the Martian Spirit is crying a single tear when She appears (it's not just because She sensed the pain of their journey, and their pain of losing a friend/pilot along the way. She is also crying a tear for all Humanity). I used to have a bit of trouble with some of the dialgue in this scene, for I thought it somewhat unneccesary, but then realized that it's there so that the fact the Ancient Martian Spirit and Gary Sinise's character communicate telepathically for just a few seconds, in a very short moment that is done in a ""visual storytelling"" way, is more evident on subsequent viewings. You can almost hear the words: Martian-""You want to go Home?"" and Sinise's reply-""Yes, I do."" And, oh my god, the evolution scene is AWESOME! Yet, for any Christian viewers, this is a Disney film, so listen for a lot of nice references to God and Jesus, and a nice film free from any vulgar profanity. Not that profanity offends me (""Scarface"" is one of my all-time favorites -another DePalma classic!- has f**k in it over 100+ times, but it serves the story of that film; in this one there's no need for it.)
As for film making techniques that I hinted at before, now that I've mentioned Maggie (SO perfectly played by the great Kim Delaney), a character that's not only seen but one time in the film (well, twice counting the flashback at the end), yet a character that is definetly no SMALL character; as there never seem to be any of those in any of DePalma's films - even the SMALLEST of roles are also most times some of the most key roles- is shown to us in a movie within a movie within a movie, and to me this movie is worth owning just for scenes like that alone, let alone all the other NUMEROUS scenes that are just awe-inspiring to any film student today. Yes, there's maybe some nonperfect dialgoue, and/or dialgoue in a scene that didn't need it, but overall this is a solid masterpiece of sci-fi! I would easily rank this on the same level as Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", Spielberg's ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", George Lucas' first 3 ""Star Wars"" films, or ""Contact"". No gory ""Men In Black"" type aliens, thank God. A simple story about a lonely widower that only wants to go ""Home"", even if it means leaving the world you're in now to get there, this is an AWESOME version of any ""Odyssey"" story ever told!",1170028800,7,6260,4.520282186948854
1099726,4,6305958041,"Having seen MISSION TO MARS when it got its (lamentably) brief theatrical release in the spring of 2000, and several times since on both VHS and DVD, I must disagree with all of the reviewers who put this film down for its faults.  It's as if, having been pre-conditioned by the STAR WARS films, we seem to expect every sci-fi film released nowadays to have plenty of spectacular and/or violent action sequences, or to just have elements of other genres, be they western or war films, grafted onto futuristic settings.  Obviously, MISSION TO MARS is not that kind of film by any means.  It is also definitely NOT, however, a failure; for despite its numerous little imperfections, I have seen far worse.

Involving an expedition to the Red Planet, led by Don Cheadle, that meets a terrible end for mysterious reasons, and requires a rescue operation, manned by two of Cheadle's closest compatriots (Gary Sinise; Tim Robbins), MISSION TO MARS is clearly much more in the stately style of Stanley Kubrick's classic 1968 sci-fi film 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (with pointed references to the Arthur C. Clarke story, ""The Sentinel"", that gave birth to that cinematic masterpiece) than it is to the STAR WARS films.  Undoubtedly, this was intentional on the part of director Brian DePalma (CARRIE; SCARFACE), who, like Spielberg and others of the Film School Generation, venerated Kubrick.  And while the screenplay's dialogue by Jim Thomas, John Thomas, and Graham Yost (the latter of SPEED fame) is occasionally  clunky (or rendered that way by the cast), the visuals of the Martian landscape are about as realistic as anything I've seen from any science fiction film in quite a while.  The final sequences inside the white ""face"" of the Martian mountain have a sort of eerie resonance to them, much like the enigmatic room at the conclusion of ""2001.""

Flawed though it might be, I wouldn't think of putting MISSION TO MARS down with such execrable pieces of junk as BATTLEFIELD EARTH or PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE as others are willing to do.  That's why I'm giving it a four-star review.  I accept its flaws, and just soak in the visuals and the impact of its intriguing storyline.",1169164800,3,2176,4.854054054054054

At least Plan 9 contained scenes to make you laugh; this movie just makes you cringe from start to finish.  It combines bad plot with wooden dialog, bad acting, tired direction, and an overall story-line that is riddled with cringe-making errors and stupidities.  This is the kind of movie stoned teenage drop-outs would make if someone was foolish enough to give them the resources.  Even the title is flat.  My own party-game (dreamed up in order to survive the movie, which my children wanted to watch until they too gave up in disgust) was to invent better titles referencing older sci-fi classics.

We don't yet have a good manned-mission-to-Mars movie, and it would be good to have one, since the possibility we'll eventually have such a mission is still there.  I think the movie has some bright spots: Gary Sinese is good and the whole middle sequence involving the rescue mission--in between Earth and Mars--is actually exciting and well-executed.  There bright spots, and the movie probably does not deserve the horrendous reviews.  And, it is nowhere near so-bad-it's-good territory, but it certainly fails. It is just so hopelessly derivative.  The dialogue cliches are painful but, more importantly, we have such a clear amalgam of aspects of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters, and The Abyss, that the movie comes off as having no fresh ideas.

1099808,3,6305958041,"Mission to Mars represents sort of a weird point in the career of director Brian De Palma, in my opinion.  His two previous films were Mission: Impossible and Snake Eyes, two of his most financially successful films.  Therefore, I view Mission to Mars as the point in De Palma's career that the Hollywood establishment was truly willing to give him a shot at directing the big-budget, crowd-pleasing movies that bring in all the dough for the studios.  The problem is that De Palma just isn't that type of director.  He is the director of the movies that the studios make after they pull in the profits from the big-budget blockbusters.  Therefore, the result you get is a movie that has flashes of brilliance, but ultimately its cheesy script and convoluted plot bring it down.

Mission to Mars follows the crew of a rescue mission (Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Jerry O'Connell, and some woman) who have been sent to Mars to rescue the one surviving crew member of the first mission to Mars (Don Cheadle).  Just after the original crew members make a discovery that they think could be ice, three of the four are slaughtered in a horrific incident that is one of the movie's best scenes.  After a mayday transmission is sent to the space station, the rest of the main characters set off to save Luke (Cheadle).  It isn't easy however, and the journey to Mars is really the best part of the film.  Specifically, the thrilling sequence that takes place after the shuttle goes through a micro-meteroid shower.  This sequence is one of two where De Palma's ability to direct really shines.  It is edge-of-your-seat stuff.

Sadly, after the rescue crew lands on Mars, the whole movie goes downhill thanks to the lackluster script, and some special effects at the end that are truly laughable (and it pains me to say the word ""laughable"" ever about a De Palma film).  To give credit where it is due, I must admit that this film is one of the few in Hollywood history (or future) that has dared (or will dare) to make a movie about aliens in which the aliens aren't evil, blood-sucking creature who try to destroy the earth.  The movie's optimism is a very good, rare asset, but ultimately the ending just feels cheesy and contrived.

The one very bright spot for the film are the special effects/visuals.  De Palma threw a few Kubrick shout outs in via some ""2001-ish"" shots.  And the disaster sequence at the beginning has some of the coolest visuals I think I ever might see in a film.  So in that way, the film does keep your attention somewhat, even if it is only for the eye candy.

This film just goes to show that no matter how talented a director or a cast, a film ultimately relies on its script.  De Palma and Tim Robbins do their best to carry the film, but it ultimately collapses on itself.",1156723200,4,2795,4.572289156626506
1099809,1,6305958041,"OK, I will violate the maxim:  If you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all.  Watching this film is like driving slowly past a horrible accident scene.  You just hurt for everyone involved.  Every cliche of bad science fiction is lovingly included and lingered over so as to allow the viewer to savor the awful spectacle. There is a conspicuous lack of understanding of the genre; of what makes a good science fiction story.

Where to begin?  The film can't choose its angle--it has no focal point.  We don't see any conflict in the mission preparation, there is little exposition of the science or challenge involved--indeed, all we get by way of exposition is some lame footage of a BBQ.  It goes downhill from there.

The eponymous mission to mars encounters a precisely placed shower of micrometeorites at exactly the wrong time and then the crew (off the cuff mind you) takes a jaunt through open space and just happens to find a convenient supply capsule that they are able to bring to the surface in some fashion just skipped over.  So, what kind of scene covers the trip from Earth to Mars?  A dancing scene...  I kid you not.

I can't even bear to recall the initial scene where our intrepid astronauts are wiped out by a storm (bear in mind that a stiff wind on Mars is hard pressed to move dust) that is caused by an alien construct because, as we later learn, the astronauts didn't use the right password.  They later figure out the password and of course the alien race that just wiped out three humans is now revealed as the very creator of humanity.

1099810,1,6305958041,"This movie at least sounded interesting as a premise.  Problem is, it's not so much a science fiction exploration of a potentially interesting idea, it's a schitzophrenic mishmash of movie mistakes.

---

The Good:

Interesting premise, explore mysteries of life on Mars and its connection to life on Earth.

Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise... some of the time.

Tha Bad:

A script that purports to be science fiction, but fudges the science for the sake of poorly written ""drama"".  It's more a horror story on the way to Mars, wrapped around a somewhat silly idea that could have been serviceable with a story written around it, instead of the ""tension/horror"" factor.

---

The movie bounces back and forth between wanting to be a horror flick (killing off people in interesting and gory ways... not consistent with the PG rating, by the way), a ""character drama"" (""heartfelt"" friendships and moments of emoting), and a science fiction idea (the central ""secret"").

If it were played as a mystery or a puzzle, like ""Contact"", it might have been interesting. Unfortunately, the detective work in M2M is underdeveloped, promising though it might be.  Whether or not you agree with the idea of DNA, as presented (Martians seeding Earth way back when), it's at least an interesting premise.

There are just too many questions to be answered to make this a good film, and they are all the wrong type of questions.  Not ""how did the Martians do all they did and why do they want to contact us?"" questions, either...

More like:  Since the Martians want us to contact them, apparently... why make a homicidal watchworm?  Why didn't the first crew think that a targeted storm bearing down on them was a ""Bad Idea"" and a time to get out of the way?  Why does the spacewalk scene treat the astronauts like they are moving through water or an atmosphere, instead of space?  (The death of Tim Robbins' character being the utterly stupid culmination of a series of actions that no professional astronaut would do, much less a team of trained professionals.  The basic misunderstanding of physics is glaring, given the ""science"" pedigree of the movie.)  Why do we need to see, in gory detail, how the hapless astronauts die?

If you want a horror/sci-fi flick, there are things out there to sate your desire.  The ""Alien"" series, for one.  If you want intelligent science fiction, try ""Contact.""  If you want a rollicking mystery/adventure... maybe ""National Treasure"" will fit the bill.  Mission To Mars doesn't know what it wants to be, and so it can't manage any of the above.

It's a case study of what not to do, and what happens when Hollywood gets a hold of scientific ideas.",1151884800,2,2666,4.7894736842105265
1099811,4,6305958041,"I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this movie. I certainly liked it better than ""Red Planet"". I believe ""Mission to Mars"" to be the better of the two movies. It has a stellar cast and, I thought, good on screen chemistry between the actors. Most of the special effects were excellent. All in all, it is a good directorial effort by Brian De Palma.

Somehow, however, this has become the movie that viewers love to hate. Well, I am afraid that I disagree, as I found it to be a pretty decent sci-fi move. Of course, I am partial to this genre of film, so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie.

The premise of this movie is simple. A crew is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil. A new crew of four go on a rescue mission. These four, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen, Gary Sinise, and Jerry O'Connell, make up the rescue crew. Due to problems encountered in space, only three of the four make it to Mars.

When they get to Mars, they find the surviving crew member. Debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission, they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is, in fact, a giant metallic head made in the image of man. Therein lies the mystery. What they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before. The ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" So, I ask you, how bad can this movie be? On the contrary, it is actually pretty good. Better yet, it can be watched by the entire family.",1146096000,5,1729,4.363354037267081

Shame on Hollywood, that had two shots at the martian exploration theme (Red Planet, another waste, perhaps slightly better than this), and none of them delivered.

Review update: the 'Face of Mars', even BEFORE this movie was made, everyone knows that is just a big hill; the 'Face' was seen only because low picture resolution with 70s technology and the shadows created with sun lighting at a certain martian hour.

1099933,1,6305958041,"This movie has surpassed Star Trek V as ""worst film ever made.""  Every character in it had an IQ of 3 and trying to watch it was the most frustrating experience I've ever had.

It might have been just a bit better if the writers had bothered to do any research at all into space travel or physics or science.

I'm not an astronaut, but I am a SCUBA diver, and there are some pretty basic survival rules that I'm certain apply to astronauts as well, only more-so.  These would be things like:

1 - No alchohol or smoking 24 hours before a dive (or in this case before LAUNCHING TO ANOTHER PLANET).  The movie opens with the astronauts at home, having a party and drinking on the night before launch;
2 - Always stay with your buddy;
3 - If you're in a space ship that is losing air due to a hull breach, PUT ON YOUR HELMET instead of trying to be tough and saying, ""Nah, I'm fine, I can stick it out.""

Then there are the scientific discrepancies.  Such as:  it's a known fact that a person can survive in a vacuum for 30 seconds to a couple of minutes, and basically just dies of asphyxiation.  They are not going to instantly freeze into a popsicle.

According to this movie, there is no such thing as momentum or intertia.  An astronaut going EVA turned off the jets on her space suit in order to save fuel, and STOPPED MOVING because the jets stopped firing.  But meanwhile, the guy she was trying to follow who had RUN OUT OF FUEL kept moving.  In one case, she breaks the laws of physics, but in the other, the movie isn't even consistent with how it breaks those laws.

Further, I find it highly unlikely that a manned mission to Mars would almost never be in contact with Mission Control.  They would more likely be in continuous contact.

I stuck it out and watched the movie all the way to the end hoping for a good pay-off, but I was sorely disappointed.  It was not worth my time or money or thought.

I could go on and on, but this movie is basically a cheezy B-film that tries to rip-off much better films, but fails miserably.  You'd be much better off watching the originals: Contact or 2001.  In fact, even Silent Running is better!",1131408000,11,2148,4.280397022332506
1099934,5,6305958041,"Brian De Palma's ""Mission to Mars"" is one of the most frequently slammed films of all time. I believe there is a psychology behind this that is rooted in the ""herd mentality."" Yet I also acknowledge that some of the harsh criticism is a visceral reaction by people...I know because we first saw it in the movie theater and my wife (a former college professor) had the same kind of negative reaction. In fact, I remember being somewhat angry because that almost ruined it for me.

Since then I have had a chance to view this marvelous film many times (by myself!). I keep hearing the words ""cliche-ridden"" and ""derivative."" But what movie ISN'T cliche-ridden and derivative? When it comes to dialogue, isn't most human conversation full of cliches and sound bytes? Yes, people really do talk like this. The truth of the matter is that people don't talk the way that actors do in movies. In reality, the conversation in ""Mission to Mars"" is probably more realistic than in other movies for that reason.

On the point of being derivative, that's one of the plot points that I believe is a positive. Obviously parts of the film are derivative of Ron Howard's Apollo 13, but what people tend to forget is that Apollo 13 really happened. Don't blame De Palma for the fact that space travel can be dangerous. What do you do when you have car trouble in outer space? And consider the fact that most unmanned missions to Mars have been failures. The ""disaster"" aspect of Mission to Mars was brilliant and well executed, particularly with regard to the micro-meteorites. The scene where the camera pans back to show us how badly damaged the propellant tanks were is absolutely chilling. Tim Robbins' character was not allowed to fully investigate because of the time window and angle for reentry.

There are so very few films that have dealt seriously and realistically with outer space: 2001, 2010, Outland, and a few others. What De Palma has done is to give us a realistic look at what a manned mission to Mars might be like, with the very real risk of mission failure. NASA purportedly worked very closely with the filmmakers to ensure that everything was accurate. Of course, it goes without saying that De Palma's people withheld the key ""alien"" plot point, which angered NASA people when they found out. It is from this source that most of the negativity is coming from for this film, and the public picked up on that. However, even those who knew nothing about the NASA fracas would conceivably reacte in a visceral fashion since De Palma, in a sense, not only deceived NASA, but the audience, by playing it strictly by the book until the aliens step in, and then it's off to Oz. I think this is what upsets people, because I cannot think of one criticism that is valid here except that one.

The ending, and the alien's ""back story"" is not only compelling but innovative. We already know that Mars had a cataclysm because the planet is virtually dead...there is almost no strength in what remains of its electromagnetic field. The idea that life could have been born on Mars is not only fascinating but quite likely, given what we know about Mars today and its water.

The performances, FX and musical score are all above-average. But could it be possible that De Palma didn't want to make an ""Ordinary People"" in outer space. D'ya think? Clearly the story is not meant to focus upon the characters or in dramatic exchanges, except to the point where the death of Maggie is given new meaning and her surviving husband experiences reconciliation with the universe.

Watch this movie with an open mind and ignore the critics. The one scene that I found hilarious is when Luke finds out the Rescue Mission lost their ship and says, ""This is a rescue mission?"" The irony of that statement was lost on most I'm sure.",1114992000,45,3810,4.670640834575261

As a huge sci-fi fan, I would have expected something imaginative and interesting, but all we got were truly piss-poor climax points. Words can't describe how awful the story was, and as far as some of the special effects, they were brilliant, but had been used in other films; for example: the monster sandstorm taken from the wonderful ""The Mummy"", the exploding spaceship was from the brilliant ""Armageddon"" and so on.

While this film might be one of the most impressive science fiction films visually, the derivative plot elements can't save it from the land of the merely mediocre.  Director Brian De Palma's trademark slow pans are here, easing the camera over some wonderful scenery of the red planet and futuristic spacecraft.  Unfortunately for the background, there's a story going on in the front, with ideas borrowed heavily from fare like 2001, The Abyss, and Sphere.  Most of the actors do a good job with the material they're given, and it's certainly a great list of talent:  Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle, Gary Sinise.

I won't complain about the slow plotting, because frankly I didn't think it was that slow.  In fact, I thought that a lot of the slow buildups added favorably to the ""drifting through space"" feel and increased the terror and suspense built into the story.

How would you like to go through what the characters do in this film, only to come face-to-face with a technologically advanced cartoon?  What were the filmmakers thinking?
Derivative and cliche-ridden as it was, the story is actually compelling.  Fine efforts were made to replicate scientifically plausible scenes in space. Once on Mars, however, plausibility is virtually thrown out the escape hatch.

Using ""The Face"" as a plot point was ridiculous since by the time we send a manned expedition to Mars, the planet and its landmarks would have been thoroughly mapped.  The characters' sense of surprise upon first seeing ""The Face"" was when the film lost its grip on me. Despite the ""astronomical"" odds against the characters being drawn to ""The Face"" on a planet the size of Mars, it probably still COULD be explained by extraterrestrial intervention.  Let's forget the fact that ""The Face"" has already been scientifically dismissed as a natural simulacrum caused by light and shadow -- kids could care less.

Once inside ""The Face"", we're taken on the ""mysteries of the universe"" goose chase which made previous films such as ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters"" memorable, but here leaves us with a sense of the filmmakers simply throwing away an ending to what had theretofore been a compelling narrative. Once again, kids probably could care less.

But what absolutely lost it for me was The Alien.  C'mon, people; if you can't come up with a scientifically plausible alien, don't give us a damned cartoon! I'm not sure even kids were fooled by this one...absolutely terrible!  THAT'S what made this film a waste.  It's a good example of how one bad but crucial decision turned a decent entertainment into dreck.

All that being said, the overall production values elevate this film to ""guilty pleasure"" status.  Kids might actually enjoy it in its entirety.  It's doubtful, however, that adults will look back in fondness upon seeing it.",1079568000,7,1958,5.062305295950155

There's so many hilariously bad lines already in the first 5 minutes of the film that the rest of it (equally bad) won't harm you. You'll be well numb by then.
-Award for stunningly bad acting from otherwise good actors: Oh yes, they'd win that with a vengeance. What on earth (or on Mars) is Tom Robbins doing in there butchering his very own talent?? Or Gary Sinise for that matter? Or anybody involved who (tries to) acts in there??? The notion that these actors couldn't do anything better with such a poor script is moot because you get the script to read BEFORE you decide on your involvement in a film or not.
-Award for surreally braindead script: the flaws are so many you'd need a small book to list them all. Sci-fi buffs musta had the worst time sitting through this (if they managed). Man oh man, i'd heard that they're in dire need for competent script-writers in Hollywood but this was emphasizing that need in the most spectacular manner...
-Award for torturingly bad music: if you somehow survived all the above the ""music"" will surely get ya. It will, in fact, hunt ya down and get ya. That bad. While the soundtrack as a whole should qualify as a lesson for those needing to learn what seriously bad music sounds like, there's one particular moment where, and remember this was supposed to be taking place in the year 2020, an astronaut is rocking away with an 80s type ultracheesy song. Sorry lyrics included. And i hear Ennio Morricone was the creator of this horror? Wow. No wonder he's drifted to complete irrelelevance...
-and speaking of cheese, Award for alarmingly high cheese-factor: yep, the cheese is practically oozing from the spaceship out into space and onto Mars and basically anywhere the protagonists put themselves. It's truly unbelievable but one moment you think (with the utmost certainty) that ""man, surely they cant get any cheesier than that"" only to get cheesed-out the next. Scary.

Setting aside the miserably lazy lapses in science (forgivable in most sci-fi films but distracting in a story which concerns itself with the real possibility of colonising Mars), the main problem with this film is that it never gets emotionally real.  When it isn't hamstrung by lame dialogue and transparent tugs at the heartstrings, it's distracting us with De Palma's gee-whiz camera moves and Morricone's insistently - and, as it turns out, ironically - epic score.  Despite the grandness of its concept and a rapidly mounting death toll, this film never gets into the chilling territory of insoluble mysteries and our ultimate cosmic insignificance - the heart of great sci-fi which Kubrick aced with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and which distinguishes such otherwise forgettable outings as ""Event Horizon"", ""A.I."" and even ""The Black Hole"".  ""Mission To Mars"" just doesn't have the right tone.  It narrates an epic adventure of mankind and a revelation which changes the very nature of what it means to be human, but it plays like an episode of ""Lost In Space.""  To be fair, the fault isn't so much De Palma's as the screenplay's.

For the rest of us above the age of consent, director Brian De Palma has created a precious return to the earlier and more enduring cinematic values of humanity. The story is a quantum leap above earlier forms of the genre. A fine, professional cast delivers superb performances in the rendering of the story.

The story begins at the level of normal interchange between the explorers who are well represented. As we move along with the crew into the exploration of the most interesting planetary neighbor in our solar system, we encounter love, sacrifice, and valor.

1100038,1,6305958041,"This movie is fall-down, belly-laughing hilarious.  If only if it were intentional.
The strangest thing about the movie is that as bad as it is, it wouldn't have taken much to turn it into a masterpiece.  De Palma and whatever windbags wrote this tripe were only an inch or two away from making this a glorious satire. All they would have had to do is adjust the plot just a little, particularly in the third act.  Importantly, though, De Palma would have to make sure he gave all of his actors the same stage directions, some of which would be as follows:
Tim Robbins:  ""Remember, whatever you say, do it with a scowl, because people will think you're a space captain who's been around the asteroid belt a few times.""  I've always enjoyed Robbins's performances in movies, particularly The Player and Shawshank Redemption, but even with the wooden dialogue (how anyone could say ""I love you, honey...G-damn I love you"" with a straight face is beyond me), his performance was abysmal.  If he got anything more than scale for that role, the studio should demand a refund.
Gary Sinise:  ""first, be wistful; then, in the third act, think Richard Dreyfus.""  This was more a quality actor being handcuffed by a mind-numbing script.  In Sinise's favor, he does get to say one of the most profoundly bad lines in the history of film: ""They're us.  We're them.""  In fact, the circumstances in which he says it [can you say ""friendship ring""?] are just as horrific.  The only thing that would cap off that scene is to have everyone start singing ""Kumbaya.""  How De Palma could have looked at the dailies of those scenes and thought to himself, ""This is great,"" even caught up in the midst of production, is baffling.
The rest of the cast is equally forgettable.  Connie Nielsen, despite considerable screen time, is given little to do except do an outer-space dance with Tim Robbins in the one remotely entertaining scene in the whole movie.  Be on the lookout for Sinise's wistfulness in that scene, though.  She barely sheds a tear for her departed husband, though frankly, honey, if he acts that way at home, I wouldn't be upset, either.
De Palma should be credited, albeit in a backhanded way, for finding inventive ways to make allegedly thrilling scenes as exciting as a tax audit.  He couldn't have come up with a more uninteresting way for one of the main characters to die than the manner in which he chose.  He probably figured, ""Hey, how bad could it be if I'm lifting from 2001?  [heavy breathing included]""  To be fair, he was ""aided"" in his endeavor by a musical score that sounds like it was plucked directly from Tomorrowland at Disney World.  And the CGI effects are slick and ridiculous, right up to the alien's tears, which produced one of the loudest groans from me during the movie.
Bottom line, I'd still get this movie on DVD, if it were in the sale rack.  Like many Sci-Fi movies, it makes sense to watch it while intoxicated, but unlike any other Sci-Fi movie, this one is to be watched for its sheer, unintentional comedic value.  If Mystery Science Theatre 3000 ever came back on air, it's first featured flick should be Mission to Mars.  A gloriously bad failure in every conceivable way.",1070496000,6,3207,4.665480427046264

The reason it is true is because NOTHING WAS ORIGINAL except the very very very end, and also one neat scene with the ship explosively igniting its own frozen fuel. But that was it.
And the dialogue, oh, the dialogue!! I literally spoke (out loud in the theater, on opening night) the lines with the character when she said, ""He wanted you to have this."" Oh yikes.
Also, and this really bugged me. They travel more than a YEAR to effect a rescue of their comrade, A YEAR!!, and the first thing they do when they land is erect a flag. A FLAG???!! They wandered around for minutes of screen time before even attempting to search for their friend. Ridiculous.

A huge audience amassed, eagerly anticipating the movie which had been promoted with enticing trailers, featured an all-star cast, and was helmed by Brian De Palma, director of such popular favorites as The Untouchables and Mission:Impossible.  Excitement was in the air.

Then the movie started.  At first, the audience's reaction was one of stunned silence.  Surely this couldn't be!  These great talents of Hollywood had collaborate to create this-a work completely devoid of anything resembling entertainment?

Eventually, when it became clear that things were not going to improve, the audience began laughing-not at the movie's occasional attempts at comic relief, but at every ""serious"" moment.  By the time tragedy struck one of the main characters halfway through, in the most unnecessarily prolonged death scene in the history of the movies, the audience was laughing in hysterical disbelief.  At least, those of us who hadn't already walked out were.

Afterward, it was pandemonium.  The crowd roared with frustration.  There were cries of ""I want my money back!"" and ""Worst movie ever!""

That reaction pretty much says it all.

1100281,1,6305958041,"Prior to its release in March 2000, Mission to Mars was one of the most anticipated movies of the year, especially among sci-fi and action-adventure buffs. It rocketed to first place its opening weekend, making more than the other films in the top ten combined. By the next weekend, it had fallen back to Earth, having proved to be a great disappointment. This mission simply did not deliver.
The movie opens with a going away cookout for a group of astronauts who will be taking off for Mars the next day. The year is 2025. The space voyage goes well, and the group sets up base camp. Soon, there is a catastrophe that kills all but one of the crew. After much debate, NASA launches a rescue mission. It is lead by Jim McConnell [Gary Sinese], who was prevented from going on the original mission because his wife died. Also aboard are Phil Ohlmeyer [Jerry O'Connell], Woody Blaine [Tim Robbins] and his wife, Terri [Connie Nielson]. Their flight is fraught with problems. Once on Mars, they find the surviving astronaut, Luke [Don Cheadle]. He tells them of the strange phenomenon that wiped out his crew. Apparently, they are not alone on Mars.
This plot outline has potential, but this potential escaped the writers and the director Brian De Palma. A lot of time is spent on character development. It's a waste of time because the characters all turn out to be stereotypes. The movie unfolds for almost an hour before anything remotely suspenseful happens. Ironically, De Palma made a name out of directing suspense pictures that were modeled on the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Some of these, such as Carrie, Blowout and Dressed to Kill, are very good. In Mission to Mars he seems to be lost in the special effects and elaborate sets. The effects are often quite good, and one set, the interior of the rescue ship, is exceptional. Still, these elements are like gift wrap. There needs to be a good story inside the fancy packaging. What really kills the whole thing is the ending.

The part in the beginning where the alien tornado/vortex whatever thing swallows the astronauts is cool.

My response is that Mission to Mars (M2M) is not an awful film,but it could have been so much better if it was aimed at a broader audience.
For starters, let's establish right now that M2M is a family-friendly version of ""2001"" without the homicidal computer.  I don't want to risk giving anything away, but the plot is rather simple: man travels into space and discovers that he is not alone in the universe.  Rather than simply rip off Kubrick and Clarke, de Palma could have aimed at producing a more realistic story that had the same message.  Instead he took the message, wrapped it in some excellent special effects, and fed it to children.
In the movie, we are given four astronauts that we could have cared about.  There are some threads of subplots that could have been developed to make this movie interesting and make the characters more appealing.  The introduction to the film is similar to ""Apollo 13"" but leaves a lot to be desired.  But at a length of 113 minutes, there just isn't enough time to weave a better story.  Thie film's producers probably figured that the children watching it would have trouble staying awake for that long in a dark theatre.  Viewers miss many important scenes, like the departure of Mars One, that would have made this film much more interesting.
But Brian de Palma and crew do deserve some credit for salvaging this lost mission.  There are two scenes in the center of the movie that are genuinely suspenseful.  Even if the rest of the movie was a complete wash, I would recommend renting it anyway just to watch those two sequences.  Alone, they are almost enough to save M2M.  The other accomplishment in this movie is the special effects.  In a way, viewers seem to lose the awe and wonder of another world because there isn't any kind of fantastic quality to it.  Everything about Mars looks like how NASA presents it.  The spacecraft are also well done.  They are heavily rooted in the various methods that have been discussed for bringing humans to Mars and they look and act very realistic.  The ""Visions of Mars"" documentary and the other DVD extras are a nice touch that help to repair the damage that the underdeveloped characters cause.
Don't get Mission to Mars and expect it to match ""Apollo 13"" or ""The Right Stuff.""  And it doesn't fare very well next to either ""2001"" or ""2010.""  But it's still the best cinematic look at Mars that we've received in a long time.  If you have children that sre interested in science, get them this flick.  The rest of us can wait for James Cameron to finish his own Mars movie.",1007856000,4,2772,4.591463414634147
1100395,1,6305958041,"It's difficult to add anything new to the comments already made here.  Hollywood should be given some credit for trying to educate the American public in science issues.  JURASSIC PARK, DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON made some effort to use biology or astrophysics in dealing with scientific matters, no matter how feebly or ineptly.  Scientists' objections to these portrayals make the job tougher.  Dinosaur DNA is unlikely to produce anything, even if it could be recovered.  Nuking comets may be credible, but a solid iron asteroid would be a tougher nut to crack.
Unfortunately for the scientific themes, the chief purpose of making films is to provide entertainment, whether dramatic or comic.  Which is precisely where this film falls down.  It's hard to know which category fits.  It's clear that DePalma wanted to bring together a number of scientific themes - Martian exploration, the idea that DNA in some form is ubiquitous where it can survive, personal relationships in long-term space travel, and, the BIG question; where do WE come from?  Given all that, why is the whole cast forced into such expressive constraints?  Having seen Tim Robbins only in Shawshank Redemption, emotional outbursts weren't anticipated.  Astronauts have to appear professional, but Woody Blake looked more alive when he was dead.  Stiff characterization seems to be the prevalent undercurrent when making films about science.  As much as we all adored Sigourney Weaver, other than lopping Ash's head off, she remained pretty subdued in ALIEN.
A wealth of minor aspects of this film were unnecessary irritants.  The time jumps were clearly necessary to move things along, but did we really have to go through yet another last minute rescue that almost didn't happen?  That's become such a tired theme, especially in space travel.  Why did the little Sojourner keep bumping into isolated rocks, even when it was under guidance?  The images of Mars certainly don't match the photos transmitted back from Viking or Pathfinder.  Why the tired old cliche of but one survivor of the first mission?  The Force swallowed them up one at a time [and why did the first two simply dawdle as that thing formed?] a little haste in that low gravity could have spared another.  Why did Luke go cracked?  A professional astronaut is steeped in survival training.  Wartime solitary survivors are commonly told stories.  And Luke would know how many people were keeping an eye on his mission.  The list seems endless and it's depressing that a man of DePalma's talents flopped so miserably.  Perhaps a little less money on FX [heresy!] by diverting it to editing and giving the actors something other than clichs to say might have redeemed M2M.
A parting note.  2001 - A Space Odyssey, doesn't really fit in this genre, although it set the pattern for how to make such films.  2001's theme of human evolution driven by outsiders has always offended me.  It makes evolution something that can be tinkered with and the fossil record denies that tampering.  Those who've seen M2M will detect  the final source of my irritations with the science of this film.  Borrow M2M from someone to watch it once, but don't make their copy fly!",1007769600,5,3198,4.9886578449905485
1100396,1,6305958041,"Watching this film was something like watching ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"": I watched the entire thing, hoping to find something that could save the film in some way. But while ""Episode I"" had some saving grace, ""Mission To Mars"" had nothing to help it in the least. From beginning to end, this film is terrible.
What's the biggest problem with this movie? Hard to tell. Everything is a big problem with it. Plot, characterization, acting, everything! Oh, special effects were pretty good, but we all remember ""Episode I"", ""The Haunting"", ""The Mummy Returns""...the point being, good special effects don't mean anything if everyting else doesn't work right.
The plot (I won't go into detail about it) has to be one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in science-fiction. The movie is littered with bad science that someone without a PhD in astronomy could pick up. Many of the scenes just ""don't work,"" meaning they are frustrating and poorly done. And the scenes that do work have no substance whatsoever. What's worse is that ""Mission To Mars"" conveniently ""borrows"" ideas from several other science-fiction movies, especially the brilliant ""2001"".
What makes the plot even more terrible is the horrendous acting and characterization. Characters development was zero, and acting ability was in the negatives. When someone tried to say something emotional or dramatic, it sounded so overacted and so overemotional that it was plainful. Of course, the bad acting could be attributed to the less-than-bearable script, but only partially. Emotionless acting with a poor script doesn't adhere to the ""two negatives make a postitive"" idea; here, it takes everything to subzero.
All in all, ""Mission To Mars"" is just flat out a terrible movie. There is nothing here that can ultimately save it from its overpowering flaws, and while it does have some interesting eye-candy, its effect on you will wear off quickly.

His latest film, ""Mission To Mars,"" is the director's first genuine science fiction movie.  Sadly, this movie is also one of DePalma's worst pictures.
A group of scientists(Including Don Cheadle) go on the first manned mission to Mars and are largely wiped out by a mysterious tornado.  A rescue team(Including Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins) goes to the planet.  They find that Cheadle is still alive and also discover the origins of life on Earth.
""Mission To Mars"" is one of DePalma's worst pictures.  This movie isn't as bad as ""Scarface"" and ""Raising Cain,"" but that isn't saying a whole lot; DePalma hasn't made a good movie since ""The Untouchables.""  The special effects are great but this one element can't save the movie.  In the past, DePalma has borrowed a great deal from Alfred Hitchcock.  For ""Mission To Mars,"" DePalma borrows a significant amount from Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but this movie doesn't come close to matching Kubrick's masterpiece; please don't even try to compare these two movies.  DePalma's film is an uneven blend of science fiction, religious theology, and evolution theory. ""Mission To Mars"" is a science fiction thriller for the first three-quarters of the story but abruptly becomes a quasi-religious drama in the last quarter; this sudden transition is both awkward and heavy-handed.  The tornado in the movie sounds like a dinosaur.  An extraterrestrial in the film looks like an MTV-inspired version of the alien from Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.""  The movie also ends as if it were unfinished.  In addition, ""Mission To Mars"" is a bit too violent at times for its PG-rating; a PG-13 rating would have been more suitable for the picture.

After the cheesy barbecue scene, preparing for the mission, we are thrusted into space where Luke Graham [Don Cheadle] and 3 other astronauts are investigating the mysterious titular planet when 3 astronauts are killed by a giant sand/dust storm revealing a giant female face on the planet [and believe me....we didn't put it there!!] leaving Luke the soul survivor. Meanwhile on the spacestation where our 'hero's' are namely Jim [Gary Sinese],Woody [Tim Robbins],His wife Terri [Connie Neilsen, much better here than in Gladiator] and Phil [Jerry O'Connell] receive a last cryptic message from Luke saying all the crew are dead. These 4 make up the rescue mission to save Luke [also on the rescue mission there is ingenious advertising for Dr Pepper and M&Ms].The ship loses power and before you know it....TIME TO ABANDON SHIP!The crew leave the ship and head to a space pod to land on Mars. The crew make it, all except for Woody who loses his landing and meets his demise. Once on Mars they meet up with Luke who has gone senile after one year on the planet alone......or has he been alone on the planet Mars?They also investigate the giant 'head' where they send sound patterns where....they make contact with another life form. Not human yet 'it' has answers to questions people have only dreamed of......
As you may of heard, this movie has been critically panned by ALL the critics yet you must ignore these reviews to find  a truly awesome film. As my review states,dont compare to 2001,yet people WILL compare and contrast and grow to despise this film which is a true shame as many people would enjoy this brilliant sci-fi 'epic' of grand preportions!!

The film only gets 4 stars, because the ending is very much like the end of Close Encounters (see MTM, I don't want to give away the story).
I cared about the astronauts, Mars seemed real and the craft design was as real as what Kubrick did 30 years before.
The realism is like Apollo 13 with a Close Encounters and The Abyss  style of ending.
Excellent DTS sound on DVD. Bythe way I saw the film in Sony Dynamic Digital and there's only one scene on the Space Station where the camara rotates around all the actors that 8 channels made a difference over 6 channels at home.",995328000,2,751,4.251748251748252

I had pre-ordered this movie after all the hype I had heard about it and I was sadly disappointed after watching it. They seemed to have combined 2001 and the Lost in Space movie story together. Needless to say this did not work well and at the end I felt like I was watching an easy to explain version of 2001. The beauty of 2001 of course was that no explanation was given and the audience was left to figure out the ending on their own which even today viewers have different opinions of what the ending meant. Mission to Mars tried to explain everything so an elementary school child would understand it. I felt insulted by this and therefore I would strongly suggest either renting this DVD or missing it altogether. Get the new 2001 I am sure you will enjoy it more.,994550400,4,846,4.360759493670886

No - It's not a blam-blam Sci-Fi action blockbuster, but instead it's a film which portrays and depicts the emotion, heatbreak and loss that can inevitably occur when venturing into the unknown. M2M also shows us the remarkable concept of possibility thinking - something most people have yet to master. These themes are something not often seen in Sci-Fi, but M2M presents us with the best elements of 2001 & contact with a mystical presence.

The problem with this movie is not that it's bad (it's awful), but it's not in on the joke.  Everyone involved took this movie seriously -- TOO seriously.

Millions of dollars were spent... what went wrong here?  In a word, everything.  Well, to be fair, I can't really fault the actors - they were just wrong for their parts.  They say there are thespians who can dramatize a telephone directory... well, THOSE are the guys they should've hired.  To the cast's credit, they read off their lines with straight faces, which is more than most people could have managed.

As for the rest... it seemed the movie was targeted to an audience with bad hearing, dim eyesight and low intelligence.  In case the slope-browed dialog didn't hammer home what you were supposed to be feeling at any given moment, the music was always there to keep you on target.  It was so overbearing, especially during the patriotic upswells, I wished I'd brought earplugs.  Even the makeup was overdone -- did they use airbrushes to apply it?  There were a couple of close-ups where all I could focus on was Gary Sinise's eyeliner!

The only saving grace to this movie, if there was one, was the concept.  Ok, well it's not all that innovative anymore, but it had its roots in good old-fashioned sci-fi.  One star for effort... and because the rating system won't let you give 0 stars.",993081600,15,1501,4.611320754716981
1100488,4,6305958041,"I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this movie. I certainly liked it better than ""Red Planet"". I believe ""Mission to Mars"" to be the better of the two movies. It has a stellar cast and, I thought, good on screen chemistry between the actors. Most of the special effects were excellent. All in all, it is a good directorial effort by Brian De Palma.
Somehow, however, this has become the movie that viewers love to hate. Well, I am afraid that I disagree, as I found it to be a pretty decent sci-fi move. Of course, I am partial to this genre of film, so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie.
The premise of this movie is simple. A crew is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil. A new crew of four go on a rescue mission. These four, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen, Gary Sinise, and Jerry O'Connell, make up the rescue crew. Due to problems encountered in space, only three of the four make it to Mars.
When they get to Mars, they find the surviving crew member.  Debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission, they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is, in fact, a giant metallic head made in the image of man. Therein lies the mystery. What they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before. The ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" So, I ask you, how bad can this movie be? On the contrary, it is actually pretty good. Better yet, it can be watched by the entire family.",992822400,7,1727,4.363354037267081

Transmissions twixt te spaceship and command center are cartoonish and hokey. Then something happens.  There is a zero gravity dirty dance between two of the astronauts to the song DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY (Van Halen). I think they are married. Their subsequent approach to the planet is about as sophisticated as SPACE GHOST, but once on Mars, the film takes off. The special effects are awesome. The rescue of a marooned coleague is intense, and the revelation of mankinds roots is chilling. This entertaining film begins like Plan 9 meets Capricorn One, and ends like Close Encounters meets A Space Oddysey. Captivating. Well worth seeing.

Anyway, after a bit of a slow start, the movie hints that it may have potential when the first Mars mission runs into an unsavory situation on the Martian surface.  I was left wanting to know more, but in order for this to happen I had to suffer through the rather unsavory middle portion of the movie.  This is where the movie really falls off.  It continues to hammer into the viewers brain the fact that Sinise's character is still grief stricken over his wife's death.  I thought the movie accomplished this at the cookout, but I guess DePalma had little other material to work with.  The action aboard the space craft in transit to Mars is also lacking.  And I don't really mean in a kinetic sort of way, but more in an intellectual sense.  The movie stimulates the mind like an episode of Momma's Family, but without all the witty banter.  And when things do start to pick up, they really just slow down.  There's really no better way to put it.  I will give Tim Robbins credit for excising himself from this sinking ship when he did.  And while I realize the ending of a story usually isn't as interesting as the setup, the ending of this movie is rather lame.  The way the movie contrives to get to the endpoint that it does is really rather weak and amateurish.  If the rating scale provided, I would probably give this movie 1.5 or 1.75 stars, as it is by no means the worst movie I have ever seen.

1100577,2,6305958041,"What can I say about ""Mission to Mars?"" Was I anticipatory? Yes. Was I hopeful? Yes. Was I disappointed? Yes. This is classic movie letdown at its highest peak, reaching far above such letdowns as ""Hollow Man"" and ""Book of Shadows - Blair Witch 2."" There is much to blame for its downfall, most of which lies within the storytelling techniques and the all-too-slow pace that the director brings to the picture, and the soundtrack which contains what sound like leftovers from the score to ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" The movie has an overall childish feel to it, which never lets up until the final, anticlimactic ending. The cast must be credited for trying their best, and their efforts are visible and stand out, along with the dazzling special effects, as the elements to pay attention to in this film.
The movie starts out slow, giving us time to warm to the characters, the mission, and the detail involved in the story structure. We're introduced to the crew of the mission to the planet Mars, headed by captain Luke Graham (played by Don Cheadle), who feels a slight sense of guilt for his acquirement of the position over Jim McConnell (Gary Sinese), who lost the chance when he opted out to care for his sick wife, who passed away. After this intro, we find the crew on Mars, wandering around collection samples and data, until they come across a large mountain that seems to have a hunger for unwanted visitors (why didn't they just run away?).
At this point, our appetites are wet enough to stick through more of the film: the filmmakers know we will obviously want to find out the reasons for the crew's demise, so they milk the rest of the story for everything they can get away with. McConnell heads into space with a resue crew (I guess they felt he deserved a space outing afterhis grounding in ""Apollo 13""), where they encounter glitch after glitch, cliche after cliche, until finally landing on Mars to find the remaining crew members and discover a secret that none of them ever thought possible.
Touchstone Studios credits this movie as being ""enthralling"" and ""action-packed."" For a preteen sci-fi geek who just saw his first sci-fi movie, maybe, but for those of us who want more out of a movie like this, it just doesn't cut it. The movie never gets past juvenile (it's PG, for goodness sake); there is never a moment that seems shocking or unbearable. The only sequence where I found myself willing to hold my breath was in the beginning, during the catastrophic event that crippled the first mission. The movie makes promises that it will build up to more afterwards, but those promises are left in the sun to dry as our characters go through the same old material we've seen done before in better movies of this genre.
The one thing I feel is truly to blame for this film's downfall is the treatment that director Brian de Palma gives this potentially good material. In watching this movie, I kept making references to his filming techniques used in ""Carrie,"" which required a slow, tense buildup to its final showdown. De Palma seems to think that this movie is in need of the same perspective, when the story requires a much faster pace. With movies of this sort, we don't want time to breath: give us the answers in a fast, straightforward manner instead of listening to the characters give five-minute speeches about anything that may seem knowledgeable. The movie would be good with a much speedier pace, but de Palma's excruciatingly slow movement is, at times, agonizing just to sit through.
And the climax isn't any better, either. Without giving away the secrets of the ending, I'll put it like this: it plays like something you would see in a video on evolution in a second-grade classroom while your teacher provides the sole commentary. You can't really consider this a let-down in relation to the rest of the movie because it pretty much stays on par with the rest of the movie's mentality. The music, which is something I rarely comment on, also brings a childish demeanor to the story while also adding to the slow pacing as well. Case in point: the scene in which there are leaks found in the spacecraft of the rescue mission. The music here is full of organ chords and slow strings, which have the feeling that they want to burst into full vigor, but they never do. This, combined with the flaws mentioned above are responsible for bringing the movie down.
This is a shame, because the special effects are some of the best of the year. The movie literally takes us to the planet Mars, creating a visceral and breathtaking world that dazzles the senses while at the same time coming off as looming and ominous. Far away space shots as well as on-planet sequences are seamless in their integration of the actual shot and computer animatics. Character interaction with the planet and its features are magnificent, and not a moment goes by where you will find any doubt lying within the technical wizardry. The cast also aims to please, giving us nice, steady performances even if the material is formulaic at best. The cast, along with Don Cheadle and Gary Sinese, includes Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen and Jerry O'Connell, all of whom do their best despite the lackluster lines and uninspired tension sequences.
The movie does have good intentions, and for a much younger set, it is sure to be pleasing. There is a nice message about the origins of human life and what secrets Mars may potentially hold, but it plays too much like an educational video in an elementary school classroom to be any fun for those seeking juicy sci-fi on a large scale. The trailer is very misleading, which is one of the reasons so many people were anxious to see it. There is a grand vision of the future and our knowledge of human existence to be had with ""Mission to Mars,"" but it never takes us to a level of intensity that we'd expect from a movie of this sort, and so the mission is a failure.",987465600,3,5933,4.6568160152526215

The movie takes itself so seriously that it gives you no room to do just that.  It tries to present something as science fact that is beyond disbelief.  The point of science fiction is to move beyond what we know with our imagination...not to alter known science fact with the type of prattle in this movie.
O.k., let's assume you can forgive the scientific transgressions.  There is still a matter of the very sappy story, the inane dialogue, the wooden acting, the not-as-impressive as everyone says CG (starcraft looks better), the overbearing score, shall I continue?
At least Battlefield Earth was good as a comedy.  Mission to Mars isn't even funny...it's painful.
Try to stomach: the sappy opening; the annoying ""put on your helmet"" scene; the guy who doesn't seem to care about a hole blown through his hand; the ""mystifying"" Dr. Pepper scene; the affected / unemotional space walk scene (see 2010 for a good one); the ""creative"" explanation for a satellite landing on a planet; the (worst actor) guy who survives on mars growing plants in a tarp; see Tim Robins express himself like he's acting at gun point

Actually, the movie was better than I expected. They did make an attempt at character development, although a bit one-dimensionally (Sinise's character McConnell is pre-occupied with the death of his wife). The plot, although predictable, was at least an enjoyable ride while it lasted. The ending was too pat for me, but at the same time, I'm not sure how they could have handled it better. (Warning: plot spoiler ahead.) Anytime we ""meet"" an alien species for the first time in a sci-fi realism movie, it comes across as stilted and lame, and this case is no different.

Even the soundtrack, written by the usually dependable Ennio Morricone, comes off sounding like the score to a second-rate horror movie.
The movie details (duh!) a mission to Mars.  Fair enough.  The problem is, once the astronauts get there, the plot becomes incredibly contrived and, for the most part, nonsensical.

It would seem that Don Cheadle is the only surviving member of the first mission, whose purpose was, apparently, to build a bridge between the two peaks (wink wink to Monty Python) of Mount Olympus...or some such foolishness.
But the plot, as in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, is secondary to the breathtaking visuals of the dangerous crossing from Earth-to-Martian-space the crew endures.  Without giving too much away, there's a frightening depressurization when the ship strikes micrometeorites just prior to Mars orbital insertion, and the ensuing action is gripping enough to hold fans jaded by most ""junk science"" space movie fare.",985305600,19,1266,5.0673076923076925
1100676,5,6305958041,I have to wonder if most of the people who watch and review this movie actually READ any scifi. This is an excellent film in the style of classic scifi novels by the likes of Asimov and Clarke. I find it depressing that a movie like this gets bashed and then The Matrix is heralded as a great movie.,985132800,5,299,4.084745762711864
1100677,3,6305958041,"The key to enjoying Brian DePalma's ""Mission To Mars"" is to think in terms of ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", NOT ""2001"" or ""The Right Stuff"". I don't recall reviewers of ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" using phrases like ""juvenile"" and ""cornball"" to describe Steven Spielberg's  ""retro"" approach to telling an old fashioned sci-fi adventure story,so why should DePalma get slammed for using the same device? Ever heard of the phrase ""suspension of disbelief""? (Remember, it's called ""science FICTION"" for a reason...if you'll only accept ""realism"" and ""accuracy"" in a space film, go watch that ""noble"" overrated snore ""Apollo 13"" again!) While the special effects are impressive,and the director's distinctive visual style displayed in full regalia, DePalma's main strength here lies in giving the audience some genuine emotional involvement with the characters, which is rare in a sci-fi movie. For sure, the script could have snagged a few more IQ points in places,and that organ music does start to grate on you like a Rick Wakeman solo, but I really think DePalma was just out to make an entertaining ""popcorn"" adventure film, as opposed to an Important Statement. So on that level, ""Mission To Mars"" works just fine, certainly helped along by its appealing and talented cast.",984441600,11,1299,5.156398104265403
1100678,3,6305958041,"I really wanted this film to be so much more.  The moment I caught a glimps of the trailer, I wanted to see it.  After it's release I heard so many bad reviews, I stayed away.  When I finally had the chance to watch it at home, I found I was actually excited about seeing it.  I can't say that it's a bad film.  It's good.  I think I just expected to much.  With so much talent in a film, it's hard to have low expectations.  These actors do an incredible job in their roles.  I did feel like Tim Robbins (The Player, High Fidelity) was not giving his all, but the rest of the cast was as on as ever.  Don Cheadle (Traffic, Boogie Nights) shows that he is one of the top talents working in film today.  Sinise (Forrest Gump, George Wallace) is great as always and Jerry O'Connell (Sliders, Jerry Maguire) does a good job as the younger crew member.
It's not a bad film really, just not what I had hoped for with all these talented actors and a legendary director like DePalma (Carrie, The Untouchables).  If you see this on cable, check it out.  I don't think you will feel the need to own it though.",984441600,2,1100,4.156398104265403
1100679,3,6305958041,"Remember the last time you took your car in for repairs?  You asked the mechanic what was wrong with it and got the impression that he just wanted to pat your hand and say ""Don't worry about it sir...we're taking care of it"".  I got the same impression with MISSION TO MARS.  It's like someone is showing only what they think you'll like but getting it all wrong.  Am I wrong or was the only blast off scene in this picture the toy rocket at the beginning?  The rest are already in space...or worse, already at near orbit around Mars.  When Ron Howard gave us his masterpiece Apollo 13, he had the savvy to show all the intricate processes of getting a rocket to the moon.  So the audience could feel the urgency and vulnerability of the whole thing.  You get none of that with MISSION.  It's difficult to suspend your disbelief that all the special effects are just that...effects.  With Apollo 13 it's believable that those 3 men are headed toward the moon in what amounts to a fancy tincan.
MISSION could've been an update of 2010: The Year We Make Contact (2001 sequel).  The story was similar.  However, remind yourself about how much better 2010 (also 2001 AND Stargate for that matter) is than this.  MISSION fails to achieve the same kind of wonderment as those films did.  I would imagine the 2010 DVD is a sight to behold.
So why 3 stars?  Well, the last 45 minutes or so is interesting.  Most of the effects are quite nice (similar to The Mummy).  I'm a sucker for great special effects.  The scene with the martian reminded me of a much better scene in CONTACT  (another winner).",984268800,,1591,4.461805555555555
1100680,2,6305958041,"Don Cheadle, Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise, have all done quality work, including memorable characters. Saying this, I thought it was pretty safe to rent, ""Mission To Mars"" without a lot of fanfare. I was sorely mistaken into thinking I was going to see a good movie, with a strong story and highly capable actors. Not being the average Sci-Fi buff didn't deter me either. But this awful movie was far-fetched beyond belief! Immediately after viewing this horror, I kept asking myself if it was really that bad. Upon seeing how other reviewers trashed it I refused to jump on the bandwagon! But the truth hurts. This movie is really that bad! First, I couldn't conceptualize this being a futuristic movie- The setting is 2020, and NASA, is still in effect. Don Cheadle sets out to MARS first, he assists in the unveiling of a natural disaster, which fatally kills three fellow astronauts. A distorted transmission from Cheadle confirms the tragedy, and he is assumed to be the only survivor.
Initially it's thought to be an earthquake, but further research determines it to be a form of alien life. Sinise and Robbins, along with two other crew members, including Robbins' wife, take off for MARS to save Cheadle. After Robbins' silly death, which includes a forgettable scene between Robbins and his wife. A love story is clumsily injected in the story between Sinise and his late wife,(Kim Delaney) who's prophetic words unlock the mystery of the universe. I guess it sounded great on paper, but on video it's a convuluted mess.  Cheadle is near psychotic once retrieved, he then reforms back into his old-self in a matter of minutes. Sinise, the genius of the bunch, determines the land mass which erupted earlier, is alien life, who's requesting a DNA confirmation to grant access.  The level of stupidity is so great at this time, I keep looking at my watch hoping that it's over soon. This movie attempts to pull the wool over our eyes in it's own attempt to be a real sci-fi movie..""What a shame!!!!!! I want my money back!!",984268800,3,2029,4.777777777777778
1100681,2,6305958041,"Bathetic character interaction at beginning of film does nothing to draws us in. Thankfully, we arrive at Mars early on, and it looks real enough. The monster twister is visually awesome and quite scary. However, that's the best part of the whole film. The rest involves a space flight with dramatic crises and some nifty effects, but its all just a typically overzealous special effects team attempt to mask the lack of a fleshed-out story. It just doesn't have any plot development to speak of. So, we get all this turmoil in space en route to Mars to rescue the sole survivor of that nasty twister. I found myself thinking, ""Enough already! This looks great but it's wearing thin. What does all these problems have to do with anything? Let's get back to Mars, already, jeesh""! De Palma was simply too concerned with shooting 2001 derived scenes instead of cutting to the chase. The space crafts and space itself, with Mars looming ahead, looks like what you'd expect from a modern day film: realistic. It should, what with all the time spent on the visuals. Too bad there isn't as much time spent on developing a story that's as impressive. Like your run-of-the-mill sci-fi flicks, Mission, despite it's attempt at epic granduer, is typically convoluted. When a sweeping statement is strived to be put over by special effects, the result can only be hollow. So, is there a chase to cut to afterall? If there is, is it one worth sitting through? That depends on what you desire to get out of this movie. As light entertainment, it's great. Just don't expect any great shakes. This is for fx heads. More mature or cerebral-minded sci-fi fans will balk at the farcical ""decoding"" of the Cydonia Martian face message. As for the pseudo-Martian hologram, more balking for sure. It looks like it was created on early 90's computer software! So I'm thinking hollowgram is a more telling description. This is supposed to be epic? Heck, the holographic solar system that our supposedly stunned actors walk through is just plain better. A good idea, as is the display of how our life evolved. Guess which planet is responsible? Ok, while not an original idea, it's nonetheless rendered in an almost original way. Yeah, we only see evolution as we've heard so many times, but a cool, if(here's that word again)derivative moment/sequence, nonetheless. So, Brian De Palma should be given respect for at least attempting this kind of movie. As we see during the making of Mission that's generously included, many people went through a whole lot of very challenging work. I wouldn't say that it was all for nothing, but with a thin story, bland characters and predictable acting, this is the kind of pretentious movie that results. For a considerably more interesting sci-fi film in this vein, do check out, if you haven't already, Stargate, starring Kurt Russell and James Spader. The contrast speaks for itself. It's not classic, but it comes close. Just one more thing. Now I really like Sinise as an actor, but in Mission he seems to me to be holding back, as if he doesn't quite know how to feel the movie. He even appears(to me, anyway)to be somewhat uncomfortable. Gee, I wonder why? hmmm...",983923200,,3186,4.805100182149363

When I decided to watch this movie I thougth that a scifi movie with great actors (Sinise & Robbins) can't be bad. But it was bad. It had an empty screenplay and stupid scenes & characters such as the histerical housewife astronaut (Connie Nielsen). All the ""epic clichs"" were used. Sucks..

In my opinion this film is a classic like all the rest. It is the most incredible science fiction film I've ever seen in a long time. The music sounds like a voice from the past, timeless. I've never heard music so orginal than Ennio Morricone's with a sense of direction that seems cut-off from all the rest of the sci-fi film compositions. It has a different older feel to it, that changes the film as well as how you see all the actors. Sinise looks and seems as if molded into the movie itself. My favorite part is when he's looking off into the distance and onto the tree house realizing that the mission with him and his wife landing on mars had been swallowed up by his wifes tragic death, and that his first step on Mars didn't seem to mean anything to him anymore. The film moves slow but it's the kind of slowness that I find exhilerating, not boring. I think another reason why some people don't like this movie is because it's sort of an emotional flick (rather than action-packed) and most sci-fi flicks I've seen are not as slow or as simple as this one. So to those of you who have seen 2001: A space odyssey as well as Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind or Alien perhaps you will appeciate the orginality of this movie.

1100764,4,6305958041,"I like this movie, but there are unrealistic parts which makes me give this movie 4 stars.
(1) Why didn't Luke (the chief of the crew) evacuate his men when an enourmous storm happened? He just stood there and watch them die saying, ""Oh my god.""
(2) In the rescue mission, how could the NASA ship so fragile? The ship got totally ripped just by the micro meteoroid. They should have anticipated such a thing in the design time. It reminded me of the movie Armageddon. Their ship was not practical enough to land on the comet. I don't think NASA is that stupid enough to run a mission like this.
(3) I wonder why the Marsian had to kill the crews just because the tone didn't match the DNA model.
(4) If the Marsian knew that the Earth was habitual, why didn't they move to the Earth when meteoriod hit the Mars instead of just seeding their DNA to the Earth? I don't get it.
(5) The ship for rescue mission looked very advanced, but it didn't detect the leakage of fuel. Isn't that kind of dumb?
(6) When Jim (Gary Sinise) was trying to fix the atomosphere leakage, he didn't wear his helmet. He passed out when the atomosphere was only 10%. Impossible...
(7) Could a space ship's (REMO) door opened from outside?
(8) Why didn't Luke try to fix the computer after he recovered from injury and try to contact with the people back home? He had rather had a lot of time trying to figure out the sound? I would try to contact the people back home to ask for rescue me...
(9) Could M&M make exact genetic composition of an ideal woman? It looked kinda short for human's DNA...
(10) Why did the Marsian's ship that Jim went into have to break the whole face made from rock when leaving? Couldn't they just open a small hole for the ship to get out?
These questions may seem to be dumb... But when I watched the movie, these questions popped up right away.

The special effects are excellent and everyone gives a sterling performance.  I liked the film better the second time I saw it and I immediately went out and bought a copy.  Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins always give wonderful performances and their supporting cast was great.  I rate it as an excellent movie about Mars backed by hard science and good acting.  It remains one of my favorites.,980380800,4,555,4.5
1100766,3,6305958041,"Is this REALLY the worst film some of you have seen? I think not, even limiting the field to sci-fi of the last ten years.  Remember Alien3? Godzilla? Armageddon? Phantom Menace? Lost in Space? Pitch Black? There's some pretty tough  competition out there.
  True, it's not a great film. True, the characters and dialog are pretty weak, but has anyone seen 2001 lately? A truly  great film, but face it, Dave Bowman is no Hamlet. As an obvious homage to 2001, M2M captures Kubrick's detached,  depersonalized style fairly well. Why else would DePalma cast Jerry O'Connell, with his striking resemblance to Charlie  McCarthy, Edgar Bergen's dummy?
  M2M clearly mimics 2001's pacing, as well. In the earlier film. we jump from prehominoid earth to lunar excavation sites  to earth-orbitting space stations to Jupiter to Bowman's retirement home to infinity to infancy. Whew! M2M's a tight little  tale by comparison.
  The most refreshing aspect of M2M, however, is its reliance on sets and models. Compare to Phantom Menace and  Godzilla, which look like cheesy video games throughout. DePalma uses computer graphics judiciously (excluding the  final, rather silly scenes), but the realism of the Martian base could only be created with a craftsperson's attention to dirt,  metal, and paint. This technology worked wonders for cinema's three best sci-fi films (2001, Star Wars, and  Bladerunner), and it continues to pack a punch.
  So let's be honest. M2M is not a great film, but the bar is so much lower for sci-fi movies that it is a perfectly acceptable  film.",980208000,6,1565,5.0627450980392155
1100767,5,6305958041,"I got this on ""impulse"" quickly and did not read the reviews. Woe was me - I read them later and tried to can the order, expecting a real turkey.
How wrong I was. I realize that the opening shots of the film are a little domestic, but in these scenes and in the remainder of the film I started to develop a broad suspicion which was later confirmed towards the end. Brian DePalmer did not like ""Aliens"", nor did he like ""Psycho"", or ""Event horizon""... and naturally, the critics do not now like Mr DePalmer!
These films, whose mere mention makes me feel a bit queasy, are so distant from this film, I'm not surprised that this effort has attracted considerable fire. Mr DePalma has cut across convention and followed his instincts, and the result is very good indeed!
What De-Palmer has done is remarkable from several points of view. He has stuck to realistic physics - and I would be quite confident about maintaining this in spite of comments everywhere to the contrary - dialogue I would really want to believe in (assuming that the future is NOT some nightmare fusion between Macdonalds in space and the Bates Motel, in which case, you can count me outa here anyway), and observations about character and goodness that I would be very hopeful for and encouraged by.
The basic premise of the film is not so crazy at all, and is far, far more believable than the almost insane backdrop of ideas behind 2001. (having said that I guess I've really torn it now)
The music was the biggest surprise. My wife noticed this immediately, and she does not always take such sharp notice as I tend to. This score is far, far better than anything I have heard ouside of the debussy / Vaughan Williams / Delius grouping, and it is a great piece of work in it's own right.
The special effects are very well worked out, again, don't really violate physics or descend into a floorless mysticism, which has bothered me about a few recent films.
To more mundane matters. The DVD is organised very well, and my kids very much appreciated the extras, which include quite detailed expalnations of set construction and design. Some of this was really breathtaking. I think I must have just laughed and said something like, ""wow.. no WAY could I do that!""

You start thinking, ""maybe that is what happened"" or ""maybe that will happen.""  The acting is pretty good even though it could have been better considering who was in it.  I also thought that adding a twist to one of the characters in the movie about 1/2 way through was ingenious.  I do have to admit that when I rented Mission to Mars I was not giving it a chance to be half way decent because of it's PG rating.  I thought that a space movie that's rated PG just can't be good.

1100771,1,6305958041,"DePalma assembled a capable cast for his space adventure, and he had some great people working behind the camera for him. Some of the film looks great. It really does.  The set design, the cinematography, the gadgets, the special effects are all very good- even impressive.  Mars the planet looked like it should in a big budget science fiction movie.  The planets surface looked extremely believable and a galaxy away from such campy trash of the `50's like Angry Red Plant.
But the film winds up being a dolled up corny old space movie from the 1950's.
We meet all the main characters at a big party in the year 2020, as most are about to embark on one of the most exciting missions of all time-humans landing on Mars.  Without wasting much time we find out that Jim McConnell ( Gary Sinise) was removed from the Mars Landing crew when his astronaut wife, Maggie (Kim Delaney in a couple of flashbacks) became ill and passed away. He had dreamed of going, but he couldn't train hard for the mission as his wife died.  He dropped out of the running.  His good friend Luke Graham ( Don Cheadle) was given the mission in his place (even though he would have to leave his wife and child behind for at least two years).  Luke  is part of a crew that includes a Russian couple and an overachiever.  Woody (Tim Robbins) and Terry (Connie Neilsen) are a modern married and still randy couple who along with Phil Ohlmeyer (Jerry O'Conell) a  young space enginerring whiz, Jim (Sinise) and others will be on the International Space Station that's somewhere between Earth and Mars.
The crew on Mars investigate a strange reading on the surface that seems to indicate the presence or water.  A mountain range becomes a strange living whirlwind which attacks the crew.  It seems they all have perished.
But wait, there's a transmission from Luke which gives some hope he might still be alive.  Jim, Woody, Terry and Phil  take one of those one  in a thousand chances to try and find their friend and find out what has happened on the surface of Mars.  What happens is almost exactly what you expect if you have seen any science fiction movies or t.v. movies in the last 50 years.
There are three set pieces in the film.
1)  The initial attack on the planet surface, which you've seen most of if you remember the trailer for the film. We get  to this scene pretty quickly since there is not a long space camp training sequence, or even a blasting off into space sequence.  We pretty much move from Earth to Mars within a couple of scenes at the beginning of the movie.
2)  An extended scene in which something goes terribly wrong when the rescue team attempts to get to the planet's surface.  This is where the film really lost me since some, only in the movie's logic, is employed to get a main character in trouble and then to make his rescue impossible (or so it seems). When I can outsmart guys from NASA who are supposed to be smart about space stuff, we know the film has a sudden case of the convenient stupids.  During an earlier part of this sequence a prominently displayed space package of Dr. Pepper is used to solve one of the big problems the space crew is having.  Talk about your crass commercialism.  I was preparing myself for a cameo in which Bill Cosby sings the praises of Jello. Now it might be to the point that product placement in movies is so commonplace that it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb in every movie... but it certainly does in this one.  The idea that a soda would be packaged in a colorful package with a logo is pretty ridiculous.  Oh my god NASA wants to put 1,000 packages of Dr. Pepper together for their Mission to Mars.... we better make sure we put fancy labels on them... marketing, marketing arketing. (And if there were other brands of soda being consumed they apparantly didn't have fancy labels.  Hmm  soda in zero gravity?
3) The attempted exciting climax of the film.  One of the special effects during the climax is very cartoonish and phony, which doesn't detract us away from this winds up beings a combination rip off of The Abyss and Close Encounters with a little StarGate thrown in.  There's a puzzle that needs to be solved during this sequence.  How they come to the conclusion of what they are looking for is one of those so bad it's fall on the floor stupid laugh out loud time.  Too bad it's a rather short scene.  Even really bad the film would have been more fun.
Then the film is suddenly over.  What?  That's it'?  That's all we get? DePalma doesn't even have a hand suddenly spring up from a rocky grave (Carrie) to give us a big of a jolt?
Nope.

This film will not satisfy the hormone sotted, immature male minds in today's audiences, whose paramount desire is sex and violence depicted mostly by the tedium of chases and more recently, flying bodies pummeling and kicking each other.  For the rest of us above the age of consent, director Brian De Palma has created a precious return to the earlier and more enduring cinematic values of humanity.  The story is a quantum leap above earlier forms of the genre.  A good cast delivers top, professional performances in the rendering of the story.  It is supported and enhanced by an excellent music score and realized in seamless compositing between traditional art, computer graphics and photography.
  The story begins at the level of normal interchange between the explorers who are well represented.  As we move along with the crew into the exploration of the most interesting planetary neighbor in our solar system, we encounter love, sacrifice, and valor.  The result is the achievement of an uplifting and inspiring cinema experience.
  This film depicts an erudite theory that is growing in popularity among many of the scientists of its time.  This is so especially with the most recent discoveries, revealed after the film was made, of the evidence of water on Mars in long past epochs.  The film culminates in the glory of incomparable possibilities.  For those of us who saw the film on the large screen and went on to acquire the DVD, it is well worth while in not just revisiting this finely made film.

The special effects are so well-done that you feel you're actually on the red planet.  You won't believe what the crew discovers, it will fascinate you.  I thought the ending was spectacular.
There are many extra's on this DVD, including Visual Effects Analyses, and a Documentary on the ""Visions of Mars"" that are great.  I have been waiting for a ""Mars"" movie that was worth watching for a long time.  That movie has finally arrived!!",977961600,3,859,4.789115646258503
1100885,1,6305958041,"This was the first DVD I bought and it just may well be my last. To begin with, I was shocked and frustrated by the picture quality. I have heard so many good things about these DVD's but there were black bars blocking out the top and bottom of my TV screen through the whole movie! What's going on with that? Can someone please explain? I want to see the whole picture! Then there were the actors: Disney, you should be ashamed. I know that Tim Robbins is supposed to be a great actor, and I admit he was pretty funny in that movie ""Nothing To Lose"" with Martin Lawrence (not reccommended for children, btw), but as the man responsible for such liberal propaganda films as ""Bob Roberts"" and ""Cradle Will Rock"" he has no place in family oriented fare like this. I, for one, do not want my children unwittingly exposed to this man. Finally, while there was a bit of carnality displayed between two married characters, most of this film was at least pretty safe entertainment. One sequence in the middle was especially suspenseful.... The tension was palpable in my den as my family and I watched this scene. I'm telling you, this was the most gripping scene in a film since Harrison Ford jumped from the dam in ""The Fugitive."" Sadly, I watched in horror, and told my wife to take the kids out of the room, when the big ""conclusion"" came. Those Baptists were right about Disney...and I never should've given them another chance after ""Priest."" The first 2/3 of this movie was about working together and about space exploration, while the end was just an athiest manifesto. Completely appalling and unforgivable. We are expected to weep along with a virtual-reality alien who tells his sad tale of a dying planet and the subsequent colonization of earth. Well, brother, let me tell you I've read the bible and it didn't say anything about aliens from Mars. I'm sorry to spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I really think that the majority of Christian viewers need to be warned against it. Ignore what you've heard! This is not a good movie, and it will offend most of you good people out there. To the people at Disney: you should be ashamed of yourselves. I guess that Katzenberg guy has a pretty good head on his shoulders, since he left Disney's ... fold and made the wholesome film ""Prince of Egypt"" for Dreamworks. At least some of those Babylon (sorry, ""Hollywood"") film producers don't have one foot in the lake of fire, if you know what I mean. ""Mission To Mars"" does have good music, and Gary Sinese, but if you know what's good for you, you should not buy this movie.
(I guess no one understood that this was meant as a joke. My point is that this film is so awful you can hate it for a million reasons. You can take 15 completely different people and they'll give you enough information to fill up a 768 page book on the utter atrocity that is ""Mission To Mars.""

The director seemed intent on shoving down your throat that Gary Sinise is depressed over the loss of his wife.  He spends about 10 minutes of film, in one scene alone, making you watch Gary viewing home movies of his desceased wife.  So it becomes very obvious that something unique is going to happen to his character during the film.  Then he spends another large block of time showing you a family BBQ where you meet alot of the crew members.  Then he spends more time in the over drawn out scene where the husband of one of the characters dies out in space.  It looks like that part was put in just to give the actess, playing the wife, her ""big"" scene in the movie.  On and on and on. The mystery of Mars gets lost while the story focuses on the lame and very routine characters.  There's nothing remotely interesting about any of them.  Don't expect anything even remotely resembling 2001: Space Odyssey.  Only the very end of the film has anything worth watching. I notice alot of viewers making comments about its great visuals.

It was not the worst movie I have ever seen nor was it the best.  The CGI was beautiful, and the Science was Solid (NASA consulted to maintain accuracy), the acting was sufficient.  I have to say that the sandstorm in the beginning was laughable but I found the rest of it to be quite enjoyable. So what if it was not super fast with headache inducing jiggle-cams. I am tired of the fast action/horror sci-fi movies where people are always chased and slaughtered by barely seen creatures. This is a break from that and it is slower paced. Do not expect 2001 and certainly do not expect this to become known as one of the greatest but expect a Sci-Fi that thinks beyond convention.  If you cant use and stretch your imagination and accept the possibility that we are not the only life-forms out here either because of religous constraints or scientific statism then avoid this movie. If you like the possibility that we really are just beginning to learn (as science continually shows us) then you will probably enjoy this.  Do not go looking for revelations nor expect to find the same old stuff . Sit back, relax, suspend disbelief and don't be afraid to laugh at it sometimes.

What there was in the special effects department were done well, but other than that I absolutely hated this movie.  The story was so choppy and seemed drawn out.  The pivotal and really dramatic scenes were hokey as well.  I love De Palma's work.  Snake Eyes was at least a well done movie.

1100970,2,6305958041,"Mission to Mars suffers from the same malady that so many of today's feature science fiction films do: it's dumbed down to the point where it insults the audience's intelligence.
I wonder how movies like Mission to Mars get made. Do these studio guys deliberately make these films stupid because they think we, the viewing audience, are too dumb to understand a more complex, scientifically accurate film? Now, I'm not some MIT graduate, ST:TNG fan who goes ballistic every time the laws of physics are flouted in a sci-fi movie, but I'd just like to see a little attempt to make things a little more realistic.
Mission to Mars isn't all bad. Many of the special effects are cool looking, most of them CGI. Some of the space sequences are interesting to look at.
But that's about where it ends. Gary Sinise looks like he's had about an inch of facial make-up thrown on. What happened to this guy? Why the need to embellish his face with more base than an Estee Lauder model? Weird. I'm surprised Tim Robbins signed up for this one. His standards are usually higher. His efforts and those of the other actors in the movie are mostly wasted by a lackluster script and subpar direction by Brian dePalma.
The quality of the DVD version is fine and there's a fairly interesting bonus feature on the making of the film, but not enough to justify the price of admission.
Obviously, I don't recommend this movie to you, but if you're a sci-fi and special effects fan, and you have a Saturday night to waste, you might get something out of Mission to Mars.",976492800,7,1547,4.588447653429603

I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews posted here, when you consider the average grade on the scorecards at this wonderful movie's premier was a B-minus!  In fact, I think that in time, this astounding movie's reputation will grow until it equals the prominence of  ""2001:  A Space Odyssey""  (available on DVD from Warner Bros.)!  [As a side note, Mr. De Palma HOMAGES  ""2001""; he doesn't  ""rip it off""  as some reviewers say!]
The big-name cast includes:  Academy Award-winning Gary Sinise . . . Hollywood's  ""wunderkind""  Tim Robbins . . . the lovely Connie Nielsen, last seen in this summer's $100 million-earning blockbuster  ""Gladiator"" . . . the gifted Don Cheadle . . . and up-and-comer Jerry O'Connell, from TV's  ""Sliders""!  With a top-notch cast like this, you just can't go wrong!
De Palma certainly hasn't lost his touch!  Watch for the scene where Gary Sinise's character locates a leak in the spaceship by opening a packet of DR PEPPER in a zero-gravity situation!  This amazing DR PEPPER sequence is typical of De Palma's consummate artistry, and this fantastic film is just studded with scenes like this!
The score by Ennio Morricone may be the most brilliant in a film since  ""Amadeus""!  So moving, so haunting . . . it's as if Leonard Bernstein and Yanni have combined forces in Music Heaven!  And the ending! -- Eschewing the trendy darkness of recent sci-fi movies like  ""The Matrix""  and  ""Pitch Black"", ""Mission to Mars""  goes instead for universal acceptance!  Its strong spiritual message is grounded in humanitarian values!  [And it DOESN'T  ""rip off""  ""Close Encounters""; it HOMAGES the earlier film!]  Criticism of the wholesome finale only illuminates the despair of our cynical age!

Likewise, the sequencing of scenes with wildly varying emotional tones provides the audience with no sense of continuity (e.g. the bizarre Van Halen dancing scene between 2 other grim scenes)

1101051,4,6305958041,"It was with some trepidation that I viewed ""Mission to Mars"" on DVD. The reviews were not good. I was left with the impression this was another shlocky attempt at space opera.
Not at all: what we have here is a true SF fan's movie, albeit a flawed one.
Exquisitely crafted sets. Breathtaking scenes. But more importantly a story and characters I empathize with.
Take two parts  ""2001: A Space Odyssey""; one part ""The Right Stuff"", one part ""Contact"", one part ""Close Encounters"",  part ""Aliens""; mix well. I could have done without the  part ""Aliens"".
Was this derivative? Yes: gloriously so. If you're looking for a ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", ""Independence Day"" or even an ""Aliens"" derivative, don't look here.
The first manned mission to Mars is almost wiped out in an encounter with an alien artifact, necessitating a 2nd mission to rescue the first. Earthbound controllers don't know what has happened; they conjecture an earthquake (mars quake?) has had devastating effects but there may be survivors.
I'm willing to forgive most of the contrived plot devices employed to increase suspense; some worked, some didn't.
The Gary Sinise character leaving off his helmet during a literally breath taking rush to prevent total decompression of their ship was particularly goofy; this annoyed me. The Tim Robbins character's demise could have been better orchestrated. The situation ignored common sense and defied Newtonian physics. But, both these scenes were shot in such a breathtaking manner that that they worked for me in spite of these flaws.
However, the plot device of having the 1st encounter with an extraterrestrial intelligence end violently is unforgivable. This would be the  part of ""Aliens"" at work. Later, in a strange twist, this device turns xenophobic on the part of the aliens. A more appropriate turn of plot would have had some more mundane human problem necessitate the 2nd mission to rescue the first. Or perhaps a mars quake.
The music score felt anachronistic; however this imparted a sense of realism in a movie portraying events 20 years in the future. The somewhat mundane dialogue also served the same purpose and did not detract from the empathy I felt for the characters.
Not a chick-flick, probably not a wife-flick (I chose to view this when she was out shopping, however having seen it I might try it on her). Definitely an SF enthusiast's flick even with its flaws.",974678400,2,2401,4.995

Let's start with the acting.  Connie Nielsen's performance during Tim Robbin's death scene was perhaps the most painful two minutes of overacting in years. Barely 3 minutes later, she seems to have forgotten that her husband has turned himself into a popsicle. She shows no trace of sadness or emotional trauma.  Then, there's Don Cheadle.  Marooned for a year after watching his friends die, he's a nutcase.  But he pulls off his comical bushman wig and facial hair and returns to sanity without skipping a beat.
The score is a mess, never in sync with the action on the screen and lurching from one musical genre to another with no attempt to weave a coherent whole.  From grinding organ tones in one scene (that never reappear, thankfully) to sweeping strings (where silence would have been better), Morricone seemingly cut and pasted leftovers from previous films and hoped no one would notice.
This movie deserved every bit of nasty criticism it originally received, and then some.",974419200,4,1187,4.939698492462312
1101053,1,6305958041,"I just rented Mission to Mars, and it is so horrible I feel I need to speak out.  I cannot believe there are five star reviews here.  Do not, under any circumstances, watch this film if you have ever done any of the following:
1. Taken an entry-level or higher course in physics, astronomy, biology, genetics, or physiology. (I'm not kidding, your brain will refuse to process certain parts of the show)
2. Ever seen a good science fiction movie such as Dune or The Matrix.
The idea of science fiction is that part of the story is based in some part on science. Take, for example, the Matrix. While the movie is purely fantastic, it is a logical leap from our current understanding of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and neurophysiology. The fact that it takes place at least 100 years in the future actually leaves room for the leap to happen.
Mission to Mars takes place a scant 20 years in the future. But we have crystal clear computer displays scattered all over our space vessels and space SUITS!!  There are sensors everywhere, except where they would interefere with the plot (say some kind of fuel gauge).  The astronauts' wrist computers can solve ridiculous physics problems in less than a second.
And that's just the improbable -- there's plenty of impossible to go around. The greenhouse on Mars is completely open to the outside atmosphere, but the astronauts can breath just fine! If you ever run out of oxygen, just stand next to a cactus. A single DNA base pair is a ""chromosome"".  Puncturing a shuttle's hull causes all the computers to crash (lousy microsoft!). Despite the well-known fact that spacecraft use solid fuels because liquid fuel weighs too much, NASA decided to use liquid fuel anyway.
So what if you know nothing about science? How's the acting? Terrible. How's the story? Predictable. And if you really don't know enough about science to hate this movie, let me suggest college (or least a GED).",974246400,8,1939,4.776119402985074

You'd never know that from the work he's put out this decade.  While  *Mission to Mars*  isn't the worst thing he's done recently  (*Mission: Impossible*  and  *Raising Cain*  vie for that sad honor), it certainly indicates the work of a lazy hack with a whole lotta dough to play with.  The story's about space-jockeys in 2020 who attempt to rescue a colleague who's been stranded on Mars while checking up on . . . well, we're not really told WHY the first mission went to Mars, or what the heck we're doing there in the first place.  There is a greenhouse.  There are weird scientifickal thing-a-ma-bobs we've put there.  Why?  Because we need to colonize?  Because the gov't has a lot of tax money to play with?  Or just because it's 2020?  Who knows?  The writers don't bother going into it, which is just one example of their colossal laziness here.
Another example is the characterization.  They're all really cool astronauts . . . the females have close-cropped haircuts a la Ripley; the guys are easy-going macho, even the Guy Whose Wife Recently Died.  There's a fine collection of actors here, but they can do nothing with this material.
Another irritant is DePalma's BLATANT ripping-off of  *2001*  and  *Close Encounters*.  DePalma used to homage Hitchcock and Welles in clever ways that made us admire his film knowledge and expertise; now he merely steals, doubtless under the assumption that we'll think all these rehashed ideas are HIS because he's a famous director.  The recent abasement of Coppola nowhere near approaches what DePalma's been showing us lately -- this is some really irrelevant work.
Finally, the music by Ennio Morricone tries to supply what the script could not -- emotional involvement.  It's very dramatic and rather derivative . . . and manipulative.  So this is what DePalma's resorted to:  a TV-movie score that tries to generate involvement.  Certainly the  ""crises""  DePalma cooks up do not -- the scientific jargon used to describe these crises sounds a lot like the palaver you'd hear on  *Star Trek*:  meaning, for normal people, it's gibberish.

I can see Brian de Palma, the director, sitting with the writers and producers and millions of dollars thinking ""yeah, this is cool we got everything a movie needs for a forest gump tearjerker from mars. All we need are a ring of aliens which have cute eyes, noses, and little mouths holding hands in a circle while the hero""... whoops not allowed to spoil the ending....n and Robbins is guaranteed to  leave you in tears. Special effects are where this movie excels, and the  weightless environment of free-fall has never been so accurately and  imaginatively presented. M2M is considered by many to have a weak ending,  and I won't argue that point, but that turns out to be a minor blemish on  an otherwise spectacular movie. I thought the musical score was excellent,  but I suspect its retro stylistic elements will not sit well with  everyone.
As for the DVD version, the video transfer is superb, among the  best. The audio, as auditioned in Dolby Digital 5.1, is as good as the  source material allows, but the original sound, while competently done, is  not particularly razzle-dazzle.
There is abundant bonus material on the  DVD:
1. ""Visions of Mars"", a ""making of"" documentary.  This is almost worth the price of the DVD by itself. It goes into more  detail than most such documentaries.
2. Alternate audio track with  commentary by cinematographer and special effects team. I listened to this  entire commentary, transfixed. If anything caused me to raise the rating to  5 stars, this was it. Even if you didn't care much for the film by itself,  just listen to the commentary, and I guarantee you will have a lot more  respect for what was accomplished here.

Some very gruesome deaths occur including a guy frozen in space and a guy who blows up into thousands of pieces. The special effects were great too. One of my favorite effects scenes showed the evolution of all animals overall, but there were definitely a lot more effects than that. The acting wasn't that bad either. Actually it was a lot better than another recent really bad sci-fi space movie, Supernova. Rent Mission before Supernova or the second can be skipped all together. Interesting storyline, but only an ok ending. Get this movie. At least rent it. It was especially added to my collection because of a great documentary and a great commentary. You won't be disappointed with this one. If only people hadn't gone into the movie hoping for it to be Apollo 13 which I thought was good but definitely something I don't want to see very much again.

Of course, I'm terribly disappointed by the beginning of MISSION TO MARS so ridiculous and its last 20 minutes which present a theory sci-fi writers of the forties considered already as a clich. Let's admit that only the screenplay is to blame and not Brian dePalma.
If you forget those moments, MISSION TO MARS delivers three or four superb ideas as the dance in the shuttle or its abandon by the crew. I've also liked very much the scenes on Mars and the apparition of the killer storm, a kind of sand cobra.
Great performances of the actors with a special word for Gary Sinise who, starring in MISSION TO MARS and in John Frankenheimer's REINDEER GAMES, proves that he can play the good guy as well as the bad guy. Excellent sound and images and above-average bonus features.

It started off feeling like it was going one direction, and then they ran out of time and money, so had to tag on a bad, stock ending with some special effects to keep audiences interested.
Character development fell so flat that I was not even phased when, for no particularly good reason, one of the main characters dies in front of his wife! I wanted to like the characters, but never got the chance to.

1101182,4,6305958041,"Imagine building a car completely from used parts of various classic
automobiles without any original equipment and you have a basic
understanding of the creative process for ""Mission to Mars.""
However, despite being utterly unoriginal with a disturbing amount of
banal dialogue, it is actually a fairly entertaining film, thanks to
Brian De Palma's innovative camera work and some outstanding special
effects.
The film was panned by the critics and a loser at the box
office, but it really didn't deserve quite as much abuse as it
received.  Though the story was a patchwork of ideas pilfered from
other films, they happened to be the greatest sci-fi space adventures
of all time (""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Close Encounters Of
The Third Kind"", ""Apollo 13"" to name a few).  If we had never
seen any of these films before seeing M2M, we probably would have
thought this was a terrific film.  However, almost everyone has seen
them, so this film suffers from comparisons with saints.
If there is
one area where this film shines, it is the special effects.  This film
has the most realistic space scenes I've ever experienced.  The
weightlessness is superbly done and the extravehicular shots are
indescribably beautiful and convincing.  De Palma's innovative use of
the lens, filming from various angles with multiple cameras, gives the
space scenes a genuine disorientation where there seems to be no up or
down.  The shots of the Mars surface looked eerily like the photos
from the Pathfinder Rover a couple of years back.
The story itself
was good while it was focusing on the rescue mission, but once they
got into the alien contact portion, it got very hokey.  There were
four writers working on this script and it didn't fit together well.
They tried to do too much making it an outer space action-adventure
suspense thriller, a human-interest story, a romance, and a
philosophical mindbender on the nature of the universe.
The acting
is of excellent quality as one might expect from the high caliber of
the cast.  Gary Sinise turns in another outstanding dramatic
performance.  Tim Robbins is just a bit too syrupy as the lovebird,
but he makes up for it in the mission commander scenes.  Don Cheadle
also does a bang up job as the stranded astronaut.
There is a lot to
criticize about this film, but there is also a lot to like.  I rated
it a 7/10.  I would suggest seeing it and keeping an open mind.  If
you don't compare it too fastidiously to the classics from which it is
derived and just enjoy the outstanding visuals and well crafted
suspense, you might find it to be a very entertaining science fiction
flick.",971049600,,2623,4.8

All visually outstanding, original work.  But then there was also Dressed to Kill, Bonfire of the Vanities, and now (hopefully) his dud to end all De Palma duds (bad things happen in threes, right?), Mission to Mars.  An earth crew is sent to the red planet to seek out survivors of a disastrous earlier mission, encountering further disaster: this movie.  Slow moving, with promises of action sequences that don't quite deliver; a music score that is inappropriate for much of the scenes; pedestrian dialog, characters you can't really care about, a directionless, contrived plot; culminating in a supposedly socially significant history lesson given by a weeping alien that looks like a computer generated balloon animal.  After which Gary Sinise decides that he will do the right thing for humanity by taking up residence on Mars.  For ....?  I guess if I were an actor of his caliber and I had ended up in a film like this that has ""contractual obligation"" written all over it, I'd want to move to another planet too.  Oh well, we all make mistakes .... too bad those of quality actors like Sinise and Tim Robbins are preserved for posterity. There should be a college course in film that covers and analyzes terrible films like this one, the remake of The Haunting, Psycho 2, the Planet of the Apes sequels, so would-be film students can have a shot of avoiding what the movie industry drives directors to every so often.  Give us back the Giant Bat-Rat Spider!

1101266,5,6305958041,"I honestly don't know why critics were slamming on this film. Let alone some members of the general public. To me, Mission To Mars was an excellent science fiction adventure, with a good cast, a solid plot, excellent special effects, wonderous set design, good acting, good costumes, and a lot of science fact to the film. Indeed, the best movie that Brian DePalma made. So what if he borrowed heavily from some films like 2001, Close Encounters, and Contact. George Lucas also borrowed heavily for The Star Wars Saga. What's the big deal? Now granted the soundtrack was not so good until the end, where astronaut Jim McConnell (played wonderfully by Gary Sinise) is taken into the Martian Spacecraft. Nevertheless, the film was a wonderful picture. Brilliantly executed, and depicted how a manned mission to the fourth planet of the solar system could actually happen in 20 years. Most of all, it was spiritual and cerebral science fiction. Something we don't hardly see anymore. The last time we saw something like this was in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Journey To The Far Side Of the Sun, Close Encounters, and Contact. Not all science fiction has to be shoot them up and blow them up types. This is, by far, Gary Sinise's best role since Stephen King's The Stand and Ron Howard's Apollo 13. Tim Robbins also did a remarkable job, too. His character's death in the middle of the movie was very shocking and unexpected to say the least. A real plot twist like The Sixth Sense and What Lies Beneath. Overall, this movie was brilliant a thousand times over. Check it out. It's worth watching.",970963200,3,1588,4.757246376811594
1101267,5,6305958041,"Jaded hard-core sci-fi aficionados such as myself are supposed to look down their noses at Brian de Palma's MISSION TO MARS as a feeble and unsuccessful attempt to recreate the wonder and mystery of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I certainly agree that M2M is highly derivative, but I still love this movie. I rated it the equivalent of 4 stars after seeing it theatrical release, but having just spent nearly a day exploring the full depth of the DVD, I have to promote it to 5-star status.
Beginning with the merits of the film itself, I give special marks to de Palma's cinematography. If you are familiar with and enjoy this Hitchcockian director's use of long, panning and zooming takes (see for instance, SNAKE EYES), then you will really like the way M2M is shot. No one has ever attempted such long and complicated takes in a science fiction film. The cast, which features Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle, Connie Nielsen, and Jerry O'Connell, is first-rate. A poignant scene between Nielsen and Robbins is guaranteed to leave you in tears. Special effects are where this movie excels, and the weightless environment of free-fall has never been so accurately and imaginatively presented. M2M is considered by many to have a weak ending, and I won't argue that point, but that turns out to be a minor blemish on an otherwise spectacular movie.

But heck, that's what makes the movie interesting and suspenseful.  But aside from not coming up with new unchartered territory, the story was actually good.

It's not that I don't like Brian De Palma, because he's made some films I truly like, for example ""The Untouchables"", or ""Mission:Imposible"". But this film didn't grab my attention. And after watching the movie, I can tell my instincts were right! Now if your one of the ""smart"" people who avoided this movie, and are thinking about renting it, after reading my review, you might change your mind. First lets start out with the acting. With the names involved you might think this will turn out to be a good movie, I mean we have Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen (Who was much better in ""Gladiator""),Don Cheadle, and Jerry O' Connell. But from everyone I mentioned, not one of them stand out. There's no memorble moments here. Nothing you see will stay with you after wards. Unlike Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which is what this movie aims at. But I will refrain from comparing the two in my review. Since I am going to judge this movie purely on it's OWN merit. I can think of only one scene that sticks out in my head (maybe because I just watched the movie  lol), and I'm sure after 10 or 15 minutes that too will leave my memory. It deals with Nielsen and Robbins, I don't want to give it away, but it's full of emotion. Now, maybe the reason for such forgettable performances is due to this lack luster screenplay, which is written by Jim and John Thomas and Graham Yost. I personally have never heard of any of them, and I'm sure their names will not be remember by any for this screenplay. Some say it's too slow. I didn't see it that way, I just thought it was dumb, plain and simple. And I can't understand how they came up with the end of this movie. It left me shocked, but not in a good way. It wasn't something thought provoking. Watch the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about. The ""ailen"" in the movie is laughable. We see all these wonderful effects in this movie ( which is the ONLY good thing about this film!) and then we see this ""ailen"". Where did they go wrong! The ending is one of the worst I've ever seen, not THE worst but one of the worst. It's completely stupid! Now, if all this doesn't seem bad enough, I have to talk about De Palma's directing. The movie ""feels"" like he wasn't even there. I can't imagine him directing this. It doesn't have his touch. All in all my opinion on this film is, while it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's certainly is far from one of the best. Good special effects, decent acting, and no memeorable scenes. If your looking for a good sci-fi movie get the obvious, ""2001:A Space Odyssey"". ** 1\2 out of *****",969840000,2,2676,4.352

I had to turn off the DVD because I was embarrassed that I was watching it.....and I was alone!  People, they have detailed pictures of the ""face"" at Cydonia. It doesn't look anything like a face up close. You can't make a movie by scanning the past month of alt.paranet posts.
Anyway, Gary Sinise is an incredible actor, but with a bad script and bad acting all around him...well, the effect is comical to say the least. Although, it was so bad, I couldn't find it within me to laugh.",969753600,,575,4.4245283018867925
1101449,1,6305958041,"What if a director could take all the very best concepts from Science Fiction films over the past thirty years or so, and bundle them all into one epic?  At the very least, it should be something worth watching.
Not so 'Mission to Mars'. It starts with what has now become traditional in Science Fiction disaster movies - astronauts and their families bonding around the barbecue while narrating their character's biographies.
The film moves on, hanging its hat for while on 2001: Space Odyssey, and then grabs at bits and pieces from ET and Contact along the way. For a while, it almost becomes fun trying to work out just what film the director was trying to spoof.  But not real fun.
Finally, in an almost fanatical attempt to save the last half hour of the film from total obscurity, a mad grab is made at both the Abyss and Starship Troopers.
At times the script and acting are so bad that the audience may be forgiven for concluding that the film was supposed to be funny.  But this is not so; the background music is serious, patriotic stuff and assures us that the director and producer (at least) are still hedging their bets on this jingoistic nonsense to be taken at face value.
Good acting may have saved this film.  Unfortunately, we'll never know.",969753600,2,1261,4.591111111111111
1101450,3,6305958041,"I watched the film for the first time recently. I was expecting the worst after all the panning by the critics. Well, it may not be great, but its certainly no where as bad as some people are claiming. Its actually quite good. The special effects in many scenes I thought were excellent, although certainly some were poor. I thought the astronaut ripping apart in the vortex sequence looked very poor and thats on a small screen... One of my favourite scenes was the sojourner moving around in the Cydonia region of mars, that was just superb! The whole majesty of mars was displayed in those scenes it just looked brilliant. The sound thoughout the film I really liked especially the music at the end of the film. Yes, the dialogue is ropey in places and should of been better, but I've seen far worse dialogue - think Wild Wild West for instance!  I would agree that the acting in places was poor, especially in the vortex sequence which was bizarre...
I think the main reason why this film has been disliked by so many and panned by almost every film critic, is not because its that bad a film but its the subject matter - there's no doubt that what they discover, riled some people. That I believe is the main reason for it being hated so much. Unfortunately people today take things far too seriously, after all its just a film!
Another reason why some people don't quite seem to get this film and also think there are more plot holes than there are, is because its actually a secret NASA mars mission, so nobody except NASA knows theres a mission! Thats why there is no media coverage shown in the film or anybody other than the families of the astronauts being shown there aware of the mission...
Overall, I would give it the thumbs up and I would certainly watch it again, but it could of and should of been better, especially considering the potential of the subject matter and all the mars conspiracy theories that are doing the rounds.
Considering its a Disney DVD! Its very good, the picture and sound quality are excellent, the extras, including an audio commentary, making of documentary and visual effects information were good and quite interesting. I would of liked a DTS soundtrack to be included but this is Disney... so were lucky to get extras! Its worth adding to your sci-fi DVD collection.",969753600,3,2313,4.586956521739131
1101451,3,6305958041,"Very dissappointing.
With top notch actors like Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins, I expected so much more.
The movie starts out, at a backyard party for astronauts where Tim Robbin's character is toasting Don Cheadle's character and his companions impending trip to Mars.  This is a once in a life time opportunity that a collegue (Gary Sinise) and his wife (Kim Delaney) were planning for, before her innopportune demise. It is obviously a bitter sweet toast and Gary Sinise's character makes the expected late entrance.  I like mush, but this is way overdone and syrupy sweet.
The Mar's trip comes upon an unexpected find and puts the explorers in harm's way.  It appears only Don Cheadle's character makes it back to the space station.  For the life of me, when things started to happen on the planet, I don't know why no one thought to get under cover. The special effects are cool, but if you have seen the Mummy, you've seen these.
Back at the international space station Gary Sinese and colleague Tim Robbins are observing and convince the higher ups they can go and save their friend.  We have a touching ""Rah-Rah"" dialogue where Tim Robbins convinces them that Gary Sinise's character is the only guy for the job.  They had grounded him when his wife passed away.
Months later when the rescue party made up of the 4 of them: Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, his character's wife and another astronaut get ready to land, a misshap with asteroids winds up destroying most of their ship.  They opt to get the ""reop"" ship that is circling the planet to land with.  How handy that it is right there.
Tim Robbins is lost in this maneuver.  I won't describe how.  But, after the mushy relationship scenes with his wife earlier, this is not much better.
The three remaining astronauts make it to the planet to find their countryman Don Cheadle still alive.  A bit off, but still alive.
They sit down with him to discuss what happened a year ago and their friend has obviously figured somethings out.  Somehow, Gary Sinise comes to a conclusion (great leap of logic) that they must provide a signal to respond.  Amazing how in 60 seconds he solves what his colleague pondered for over 1 year.
Of course this works, the first time and they all tool over to the site to see what's going on.  Shades of Abyss, the Sphere, 2001 etc. etc.  The special effects start lacking here and Gary Sinise's character decides to hitch a ride with the ""old kids on the block"" and the other astronauts go home.
I only lightly covered some things, because well, if you sit through this movie you have to get some rewards.
The premise is interesting the execution, is lacking. It is all syrupy sweet with relationships and not at all technically well done.  One thing I will say though, it is slow paced it takes awhile for things to happen and quite frankly that's the way things really are.  The problem with that though, is that it makes for a really dragged out movie.
The details of the ships and other aspects of the movie are well done, however, all in all it was a dissappointment.",969667200,3,3057,4.5900735294117645

1101454,1,6305958041,"I saw this movie with a couple of friends at home on DVD. At first we tried to give it every chance we could, but the amount of stupidity that this movie thrives with made it impossible. What was the deal with the wind in the greenhouse? Did it have a hole in it? Why didn't Jim make use of that oxygen that was brought to him and insisted on choking and fixing a computer instead, it would save all that time he was choking and trying to say commands to a computer. Why did the girl that brought the oxygen to him stay in the middle of the room instead of going up to him and supplying him with it while he was working? How come the computer doesn't have a manual input capability? What if the entire ship was depressurized, they wouldn't be able to say any commands to the computer since sound doesn't travel without air.
Why is the reboot mechanism located outside on the ships hull! I can go on and on. What amazes me is with all the money they had for this movie they couldn't hire someone who knew some basic high school physics and had some common sense to read the script and make sure it makes sense. Special effects are the only good part of this movie. Everything else is either below average.
The ending sequence was pretty interesting, although in my opinion alien looked a little bit too CG. The whole DNA idea is also very original. Beautiful matte work on those landscapes as well. Unfortunately that's about all the good stuff this movie has to offer.

The situations are hokey, and not even sorta real.  Anything that aproaches being technically correct, has something that  seriously flaws it (like the presurized fabric greenhouse on Mars, that is  blowing in the wind).  The micro-meteorite hit is always a possibility, but  no astronaut in his right mind would try to fix it without putting on a  helmet first.
The pacing was too slow.  Each problem was neatly solved  before moving on to the next challenge.  With a big long space in between  to reflect on what happned.
The characters were wooden, and  one-dimensional stereotypes.  I'm surprised the actors (who I would have  thought were mostly big enough not to get cuaght dead in a film this bad)  could keep a straight face through the whole thing.",969235200,8,850,4.798611111111111
1101508,3,6305958041,"I have always liked DePalma, even though he's known as somewhat as a hack  recently.  I even liked most of Snake Eyes, a movie I know that many did  not like.  Mission to Mars is a Kubrick wannabee, but hits somewhere more  in the region of Hyam's (Director of Timecop and End of Days) 2010, which  was a pretty decent film that was much more mainstream than Kubricks open  ended and very esoteric 2001.
Mission to Mars starts in 2020, where Man  is launching their first trip to the Angry Red Planet.  The team leader is  Luke Graham, played by the always wonderful Don Cheadle.  He will go there  and set up things and they will be followed by a second mission, led by  Woody Blake (Tim Robbins) and his wife Terri Fisher (Connie Nielsen).  The  original captain of the second mission, Jim McConnell (Gary Sinese) backed  out because of his wife's death.  However, when the first Mars mission goes  awry, Jim, who is a master pilot is reinstated into the program.  However,  the second ship also suffers catastrophic problems and crash lands on Mars,  marooning them all.
The movie is well made and technically good, however,  like most of DePalma's film, it has a glossy, artifical look to it that  makes it look unrealistic.  The sky is always perfect, the Rover is always  clean.  It definitely does not look like Tatooine in Star Wars, where  everything was dusty and worn.  The main problem of this movie is that it  moves at a glacial pace and the plotline line seems like something out of  National Geographic than anything else.  There is no real tension until the  Second Mars lander is destroyed.  However, I liked the concepts that Mars  may have housed a civilization even more ancient than our own and that Mars  was once a lush green world like Earth and the little History lesson we get  was fantastic.  However, it is that gloss and ""hollywood-ness"" of  this movie at the end that is sort of a letdown.
The characters are all  played well by the main actors.  There are no real standout and the weakest  link in the movie I felt was Gary Sinese.  They aren't given a great  character script and I guess many of them (who are great actors) were  coasting through it.  Sinese, who has done excellent work in the past is  beginning to choose roles that are in the Harrison Ford train of thought  (how can I become a star?).  And the lovely Connie Nielsen (Gladiator,  Soldier) is again stunning and beautiful (although not as emotional as she  should be).
The DVD is crisp and the soundtrack is well laid out on the  DVD.  There are some extra's like a audio commentary, previews and some  other tidbits but nothing really out of the ordinary.
This movie reminded  me of ""The Relic""  that was sort of lambasted by the critics as  silly, formulaic fare, but I found surprisingly entertaining and spooky.  This movie is more mainstream than 2001 and accessible by more people.  I  sure many will be disappointed that there isn't big explosions, gory  martians or steamy love scenes, but this is a decent stab at paying homage  to one of the the greatest sci-fi films of all time....Rating: C

Now, after viewing the DVD, I understand why. 1)  QUESTIONABLE  PLOT, or should I say, a near-total lack of a believable story. Setting the  story only twenty years in the future is pretty ambitious, though no more  so than ""2001"" or ""Space: 1999""; however...did all  space-faring nations suddenly discover an endless pork barrel to finance  not only the initial mission, but an immediate rescue mission?  One can  only hope the future of the Space Program can see this kind of funding. 2)  CLICHE after CLICHE.  Okay, bad science aside...if you don't have either 1)  a believable story, or 2) believable characters, you've got problems that  NO amount of glitz and bad CGI can spackle over.  I was almost willing to  forgive the first half of the movie...the hull-puncture sequence wasn't  THAT bad (though I think the amount of time granted our heroes in finding  the leaks was to say the least, generous).  However...the dreaded  ""space walk"" to the orbiting satellite had me split between  nervous giggles, and wiping tears from my eyes.  It seems necessary to  mention the COMICAL ending that Robbins' character comes to, but we'll save  that for the sequel, ""Honey, I've Decompressed The Kids!""  3)  HORRID ABUSES of SCIENCE DEPT:  once again, our hereos' spaceship roars  majestically as it passes the screen.  Sigh. 4)  THE RE-TREAD ENDING:  Hmmmm....let's take the beauty of ""2001"" and toss in more than a  heaping helping of ""Close Encounters"".  Let's put the blender on  HIGH, and serve this concoction over the finale of ""Star Trek: The  Motion Picture"".  Yum!

A second team is sent to discover precosely what  happened and it is their journey of exploration and life changing  experiences that we follow.  Characters in this movie are well rounded and  direction seems quite solid from Brian De Palma, but it has a feeling of  flat and uninspired spectacle, in which the real stars of the show are  meant to be the special effects and expansive vistas of the Martian  landscape. If this is your kind of ticket then you may enjoy this show, but  I found myself stopping it occassionallu to do more interesting things like  washing the dishes and calling the temperature time clock (well not really,  but almost).

1101628,1,6305958041,"As a science fiction fan, I especially enjoy films that deal with current or near-future explorations into space. When I first heard of Mission to  Mars, I was excited with the possibilities of a story surrounding our first  mission to the red planet. But after viewing Mission to Mars, I have to say  that it was one of the few movies I have ever wanted to walk out from. From  opening to ending, it is filled with plot holes, bad acting, even worse  dialogue and illogical direction.  I was expecting a ""goose  bump"" inducing scene showing our first landing and steps on Mars. We  don't get it. Once taken to Mars, we are introduced to a Mars rover and we  then see humans are already there stumbling onto a mysterious phenomenon.  (The movie really pushes the ""PG"" rating in a few death scenes  early on.) There is almost no sense of mystery in the film and it only gets  worse.
The acting is stiff and forced. While there is a collection of  good actors, the dialogue is so horrendous that it elicits unintentional  laughter. One character, intended to be the comic relief, ends up being  laughed at not because of his humor, but because his dialogue is so  bad.
The direction of Mission to Mars is probably the worst aspect.  Despite an interesting sequence involving dancing in ""zero g,""  everything else unintentionally gives the impression that everyone in the  film are idiots. For example, take the scene where the first crew finds the  mysterious object on Mars. The wind picks up and they just stand there --  not in awe or fright, but for no visible reason at all. Maybe just to be  targets to die early on. One crew member shields his face from the sand.  With a helmet on?
Another scene shows us a crew member that sacrifices  their own self to save others. I don't want to give it away, but the method  they use is so illogical and badly directed, that you don't know how to  react. They show the scene and then give us 3-4 long shots of the dead  body. This scene disturbed my wife because it was unexpected and extremely  awkward. She and I both felt that it wasn't necessary to further the  film.
When we finally get to see some ""aliens,"" it is too late.  And while that moment could have been an emotional and uplifting scene, it  is instead reminiscent of Close Encounters, Contact and The Abyss all mixed  into one.
As far as moral content, there are a few moments of bad  language and some very light ""sensual"" moments, but nothing  terribly offensive in those areas. The idea of someone killing themselves  to save others sets a bad example and is not a good illustration of  self-sacrifice. The film hints that Mars is the origin of life on Earth and  may influence those who are not Biblically sound. Those who are easily  influenced by this kind of material may want to stay away from this  picture.
Overall, I can't recommend this film because it is a disaster in  screen writing and direction. There is a scene where an ""alien  being"" sheds a tear. Being in a film like this, I don't blame them. I  give this film a D-.",965520000,9,3048,4.477231329690346

Some blame could be placed on the actors. While  Don Cheedle is the lone bright spot, Tim Robbins acts like a guy more  interested in his paycheck or getting home to watch must see TV, Jerry  O'Connell is the not so funny ""Plucky Comic Relief"" and Gary  Sinese wastes our time as a clinically depressed man. Not depressed that he  lost his wife, but rather at the fact that he spent 8 months of his life on  this cinematic stinkburger.
While the first few moments hold promise  (Snake Eyes anyone) silly moment after silly moment lead to the ultimate is  sillyness when **SPOLIER** Tim Robbins decides to sacrifice himself for the  good of the crew by floating off into space. His wife's wrist watch/digital  readout SOMEHOW knows where the Point Of No Return is (No Digital Clock  readout, thus P.O.N.R. is created for viewers who need just that much more  tension or plot explanation added to the sillyness) Then as the wife shoots  out a repel line to the Tim ""soon to be a Popsicle"" Robbins it  comes up about 2 foot short, causeing an eruption of laughter in the  audience I saw it with. From there things get dumber and dumber, leading to  a conslusion that Spielberg at his most manipulative (ET or Close  Enounters) would have NEVER attempted.

The dialogue is at times clunky, but visually the film is a treat (though some of the CGI from 2000 has not aged well). Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, and Jerry O'Connell are all likable in their roles and help save some of the iffy lines through their commitment and likability. The overall plot resembles that of the earlier ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or the later ""Interstellar"" as it explores our place in the solar system and, by extension, the universe. It poses questions about the nature of life and plays with the iconic Martian ""face"" that the Viking landers photographed in the Cydonia region. While Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" were more scientifically accurate, this is a fun film. Interestingly, ""Mission to Mars"" came out at the same time as Antony Hoffman's ""Red Planet,"" demonstrating a demand for more realistic science fiction (even if both films were critical flops).",1525824000,,1022,4.982456140350878

It is a mission to Mars to rescue one of the astronauts who was left stranded on the planet after an explosion occurred that killed his other crew members.
