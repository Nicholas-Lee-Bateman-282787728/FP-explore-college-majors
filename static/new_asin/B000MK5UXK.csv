""La regenta"" - I wouldn't want to translate, except as ""The Wife of the Civilian Magistrate"", which sounds clumsy - is a novel that has received rather less than its due outside Spain.  Modestly, it's the greatest Victorian novel ever written in any language; I myself would describe it as the greatest novel ever written.

The TV screen could never pick up the highest point of the book - the fact that most of the characters think in ""free indirect style"" (the style of Jane Austen from time to time, and most notably of Flaubert's ""Sentimental Education"") - and Alas sets it off with quotation marks on the printed page, making it all the more striking.  But what TV Espanola could do that a writer can't, it did; the cinematography is magical, and, in particular, the high, high colours of this mini-series make it a thing never to be forgotten.

It does most for the setting.  ""Vetusta"" in the novel, and the locale of most of the TV shooting, is, with no attempt to disguise it, Oviedo - a gray and louring city, full of black, black stone, perpetual fog, and more than it deserves of rain.  Oviedo could be quite intolerable as a venue; however, skies are brighter than normal, grass greener, and the characters' costumes more vivid.  It altogether wakes the film up into a sort of panoply of colour.

Sine I mentioned characters ... when I first read ""La regenta"" during my grand forays into foreign novels in the late seventies, I'd made my mind up.  Nathalie Baye had to be the Regenta, Jack Nicholson had to be Mesia, Klaus Maria Brandauer had to be the Magistral - no weaker could do for these three main characters.  Well, TVE got off with much less.  Aitana Sanchez Gijon - the Ana - is a major name in the Spanish film world; but it would be fair to say that Juan Luis Galiardo (Mesia) had never touched on star quality as he does here, and Carmelo Gomez as don Fermin was a rank beginner (in TV anyway), but you'd never have known it.  The smaller parts are well done too; I especially liked Hector Alterio's elfin but fundamentally evil Quintanar, Amparo Rivelles' hard-as-nails dona Paula, Miguel Rellan as Frigilis, and Cristina Marcos and Maria Luisa Ponte as the two maids - one always scheming, the other exaggeratedly pious.

Of the plot, well, there's Alas' superb novel to build on, well adapted for TV by Fernando Mndez Lerte; but I did want to mention one marked departure from the original in the characterization.  The novel is filled with a group of the nastiest people you can think of, all busy spying away on one another and tattling incessantly; but the limp and ineffectual Frigilis becomes, in Miguel Rellan's hands, a tower of rectitude.  I'd also single out Carmelo Gomez' manly and vigorous Canon de Pas and Cristina Marcos' portrayal of the maid Petra (""la rubia lubrica"", ""the lecherous blonde"", repeatedly in the novel) as superbly done; but what Mndez Lerte has done is to write their parts exactly as Alas did.  A strong Frigilis is unexpected.

I could go on and on, praising this mini-series to the level of the book.  What I'll simply say in closing is that something with this level of acting and cinematography, AND a very good set of American-English subtitles so that there's no excuse for non-comprehension, has to be a winner.  And a winner it is.",1210896000,5,3429,4.672212978369385
