5614928,3,B00BFDXYPY,"You've got to really want the extras that comes with this collector's edition as it's extremely expensive for what's included. You get the series and ova, which can be bought for about $35 - $40, a bandana, 4 postcards, a sticker and a 32 page booklet, that's counting the front and back covers as a page for a SRP of $150. If you buy from Amazon it could be had for $95. I got mine as a one day special for $75 and after I got it, I still felt ripped off. So, if you feel an artbox, sticker, bandana, 4 postcards and a small booklet is worth the extra $50+ then go ahead and buy it as the series is pretty good. If not, buy the regular edition as it'll save you a lot of money. Oh, I expect limited edition sets to cost me more money but I also expect it to be somewhat worth it.",1419120000,6,780,3.9430379746835444
5614929,5,B00BFDXYPY,"This is one of the best anime series I think I've seen. The characters are more life-like than most animes and the backgrounds and storyline are perfect. Why didn't someone come up with this idea sooner? It was directed by Tetsuro Adraki and written by Ysuke Kuroda. The animation studio was Madhouse and the whole series it was based on appeared in a series of Japanese Mangas. This would be what happened if George Romero had gone to a Japanese High School. Lots of fan service, but that only adds to the enjoyment. The story is ""What would happen if the Zombie Apocalypse was seen through the eyes of High Schoolers?"" The action is non-stop and the High Schoolers find themselves growing up sooner than they thought. They become a toughened squad of zombie killers that they would have never believed they had the strength inside them to become. Couples pair up and the High School nerd becomes a one man army.""(I like Turtles)."" This set also includes a short OVA - Drifters of the Dead. There was a rumor of a next season, but it never came to be. Which is a shame because the series ends with the teenagers in front of a shopping mall ala  George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"". Maybe we'll be surprised and we'll still get another season. We can only hope. Get this set and you won't be sorry. Can't stop watching it until the entire series is over. No watching it an episode at a time. I'd rate this higher if they had more stars. If you can't handle the price, you can buy the cheaper version of the series without all these extras also on Amazon. (Minus the OVA) Very bloody and probably not for an under 14 audience. Enjoy!",1416873600,6,1631,4.454849498327759
5614930,5,B00BFDXYPY,"High School of the Dead is a great series that deserves to be watched.  The only objection I had with this series is that it was too short, but that's the only con this series has.  I just wish that it went for at least another season. When it comes down to the actual series It's packed with awesomely gory zombie killing action, plus some much needed comic relief that truly makes High School of the Dead stand out among similar animes.  The bottom line is that if you like action, gore, zombies and a little comedy to go all that, then you will love High School of the Dead.

This collector's edition contains episodes 1-12 plus the Drifters of the Dead OVA and a special Book featuring Illustrations and short novels, a bandana, a parking sticker, 4 Postcards, and a premium chipboard art box!

8567703,2,B00BFDXYPY,"This is my 4/10 mangaupdates review for the source material and the anime adapts the first 4 manga volumes 1 to 1: This manga has some questionable character designs at first glance which can't deny their porn heritage and here lies the main problem of this work. The artist mostly does hentai and ""edgy"" shonen manga and it shows. Just clich after clich and nonsensical fanservice but sadly no character development or real story progression to speak of. The constant hiatuses also speak volumes of the quality of this work. Read The Walking Dead and the World War Z books instead. I Am a Hero (8,5/10) further proves mangaka can do a zombie apocalypse as good as anyone else so go and read it. That one even bother to have actual sex/violence and a real romance in it so leave this childish power fantasy at the wayside.",1450396800,2,822,4.598639455782313
