2049940,5,B0001ZDKXI,I WATCH ALL THE PAST SHOWS ON MY CRUDDY VHS TAPES BEFORE EACH SURVIVOR TO GET MYSELF BACK INTO THE GAME..IT IS WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE NEW SEASON FULLY...EVERYONE IN OUR SURVIVOR GROUP IS PUMPED!!!!,1083888000,7,196,4.628571428571429
2049941,4,B0001ZDKXI,"Contrary to a popular belief, SURVIVOR is not the kind of show that only works in its first viewing.  Yes, as a game show with an unpredictable outcome, the first viewing may be the most entertaining, but what one must consider here is that SURVIVOR remains popular, season after season, because it is the best-produced show on the air.  If you have any interest in TV as a creative medium, think about what it takes to produce a show like this: the countless hours of editing to create story arcs amongst the contestants and keep the outcomes unpredictable, the artfully-woven travelogue elements that present the geography and harsh climate of a remote location, the vast creativity and ingenuity required to come up with dozens of well-designed games and challenges that will entertain viewers while truly testing the players.  (It looks as if the DVDs themselves could have presented a few more extras, in which the depth of these processes are shared.)  SURVIVOR changed the face of modern TV for a reason -- and, to this day, it maintains the professionalism and class that few, if any, other reality programs have achieved.
In fact, I'd argue that watching the series again *after* the first time is the only way to completely grasp what makes SURVIVOR work so well, as being less focused on who is ousted from the island each episode allows the viewer to actually notice the details.  New viewers, one-time viewers, and longtime fans alike should all be able to appreciate this set, while purchasing it will most likely determine whether later seasons are released onto DVD as well... so have at it.
(Speaking of later seasons, all of them contain a series of reactions and strategies against the standards set by this season, when the slate was clean and no one really knew how to play.  The powerful reactions of the often innocent players, not expecting the backstabbing and deceit that everyone expects from this game now,  are completely unique in that respect to this season of SURVIVOR, and remain gripping -- even emotional -- four years later.)",1083801600,40,2061,4.871428571428571
2049942,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Survivor turned me into a fan of reality show.  I have been

2049943,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Survivor season one was the greatest season in survivor history . Survivor Aulstralia was the only season I think to top the first. It seems on this dvd we will see more than we did when we first watched the show 4 years ago. We get to hopfully see extra footage that wasn't shown on tv. What also seems intristing is that we get to see the sixteen castaways travel from Las Angeles to Borneo that seems cool, and the post shows. ever since this show aired I've been hooked and I have been waiting for a box set to come out and finally it's here. I also want to hear what Jeff Probst has to say along with Richard Hatch (which we all now who was the winner), and Rudy Boesch, and Gervase Petterson on how they felt there stay was on the island. This dvd will deff be good and I really hope that all the other seasons will come out on dvd im sure they will.",1083283200,9,856,4.071005917159764

Well you can watch her and everyone else! Hard to belive this was 4 years ago! America couldn't get enough of this! Each episode was gaining viewers! By the time the show ended America would see ""Richard HAtch"" win the big prize!  Here is a fact about the final night!  Survivor the Final episode had more viewers than the Oscar Show!

2049945,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Ok...I know that MTV's the Real World came before Survivor, by many years...But it was Survivor that thrust Reality shows into American homes and have virtually taken over the airwaves these days with multitudes of Survivor clones and others...
Of course you know the story...16 castaways are marooned on an island near Borneo and split into two tribes.  Each week they compete against each other in contests for reward and immunity.  The tribe losing the immunity challenge has to go to tribal council and vote one member out until there are two members left.  Then a council of 9 former castaways votes for the winner of a one million dollar prize.
Season one had probably the shows most memorable cast including tough, truck driving Sue Hawk, former Navy seal and senior citizen Rudy Boesch, cute Colleen Haskell, and of course, season one winner Richard Hatch.
Each week was a fascinating look at these people scheming and planning to save themselves and get rid of someone else.  Richard made himself invaluable to the tribe due to his ability to catch fish and feed the tribe.
This skill kept him in the tribe even through his arrogance and refusal to help out in any other of the tribe work.  Strangely the openly gay Hatch who loved to walk around nude (a brilliant tactic by the way) bonded with the tough, old, and very anti-gay Rudy.
You'll recall some faces that you may have forgotten such as Sonia who was the first person EVER voted out of Survivor, Dirk, the ultra religious man who annoyed everyone, Greg & Colleen who were Survivors first romance, And Gervase, who annoyed most of the women with chauvanist comments about them being like cows.
The final episode was notable for Sue telling Kelly she would not give her water if she were dying of thirst.  Greg cast the deciding vote giving Richard the victory.
The DVD set also includes the reunion show as well as a number of other special features.
Survivor is still the king of Reality TV!  This DVDonly cements that status.",1082592000,12,1995,4.731988472622478
2049946,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I recommend watching the first installment of survivor series. Creator Mark Burnett selected an interesting group people to be stranded on an island. Sixteen castaways compete for prizes, food, and the grand prize of 1 million dollars. However, each week the tribal council votes off one their one off the island. Can alliance of four castaways outplay, outwit, and outlast rest of the castaways? Buy the dvd to find out.",1081123200,7,421,5.0285714285714285
2049947,5,B0001ZDKXI,"In June 2000 the landscape of American television was starkly different than it is now; nearly all shows stopped production in the summer, and aside from a traditional game show fad that was beginning to subside, all programming was scripted fiction.
Then Charlie Parsons and Mark Burnett brought to CBS an idea that, while not entirely original in concept or design, was remarkably different than anything currently being aired in the United States. It was a ""reality"" show, based on the hit Swedish program ""Expedition Robinson"", in which a group of strangers were dumped on an island and forced to fend for themselves, and vote each other off one by one. They called their version ""Survivor"", and it kicked off a TV revolution that does not appear to be going away.
This first season of ""Survivor"" established all the rules which, eight seasons later, are considered gospel by fans and contestants alike: sixteen players are divided into two tribes where they must build shelter, find food, and compete in challenges. Lose the challenges and you face Tribal Council, where the tribe votes out one of its players, be they the weakest link, the bossiest leader, or the slimiest snake. Eventually the two tribes merge into one where the challenges become individual and the field is ultimately levelled to two remaining players who are judged by their fallen peers. One is left standing to claim the million-dollar prize and the title of Sole Survivor.
With these parameters, sixteen Americans volunteered to be the initial guinea pigs, and were marooned in Borneo. Some were there for the adventure, some for the fifteen minutes of fame, and some for the money. It was, in the end, a game, and those who sought the pot of gold proved the most ambitious. One of the only rules of Survivor is that you cannot conspire to share the prize money. The Pagong tribe, consisting of mainly younger players like Jenna Lewis, Colleen Haskell and Greg Buis, were quite content with this and opted to lay back and let the cards fall where they may. But the Tagi tribe (including Rudy Boesch, Susan Hawk, and, of course, Richard Hatch) discovered early on that you could bend the conspiracy rule without actually breaking it. If they all voted together as a bloc, they'd have the numerical advantage to ensure a slot in the final four or five. You could call it an arrangement, or agreement. They called it an alliance.
The alliance strategy ultimately proved the obvious way to go, and it was perhaps that one aspect of this first season which proved the most influential on the seasons which followed it; nearly every subsequent winner of the game has used a solid alliance to get them to the top. It is not always the ringleader, not always the strongest or smartest. No one person or personality is guaranteed victory in this wholly unique game, because the game is shaped by the people who play it, and no two people are the same. Survivor was an almost instant ratings smash, and the first season finale ranks among the most watched events in recent years, and this can be attributed not to its sex appeal or entertainment quotient, but its curiosity. Random people scheming and plotting to outlast each other in a democratic process. Survivor is, at its core, a microcosm of Western society and politics, a grand sociological experiment of the Pax Americana.
The DVD release of the complete first series allows many fans who have forgotten or did not see the original Pulau Tiga castaways to experience, or re-experience, the show that they fell in love with those four long years ago. And coming with the hindsight of eight sequel seasons (season nine is being cast as of this writing, and producer Burnett and host Jeff Probst are reportedly signed through season twelve), it is a real trip to go back and watch how it all started; when grubs were considered ""gross food"", sloppily-edited credits gave away future events (giving berth to the wild internet ""spoiling"" subculture), and ""alliance"" was considered a dirty word. Probst is shaky here; the job is new to him and there is no edge to his attitude. It is a new experience to him, as it is to everyone else. And all the great moments are here: Greg and his ""coconut phone"", Sean's alphabetical voting strategy, and of course Susan's infamous ""snakes and rats"" jury speech, often imitated but never duplicated.
Survivor fans will need a copy of Season One. Others may want to consider this as the perfect place to start catching up on what they've been missing.",1080864000,73,4512,4.808236808236808

When I saw that I could buy these seasons I DVD I jumped at the opportunity. It's really weird going from where we just ended ( season 31 ) all the back to where it began, it feels really different and I guess it has hanged a lot. These are definitively NOT HD quality DVDs. The first disc would freeze once we got to tribal council and it made it difficult to watch the end of the first two episodes.

2049977,2,B0001ZDKXI,"...or at least the end of television as we once knew it. It was all such a simple yet diabolical plan. Get a group of random people together, divide them into two ""tribes"" and pit each of them against each other, collectively and individually for a great sum of money. Maybe they were eccentric and weird before, maybe not. But tell them one hundred million people are watching and they WILL become eccentric and weird so they can claim their 15 minutes of fame as well as all of the money.

The awful truth is people will lie, cheat, and steal when you give them a great enough reward (the cash) with great enough hardships - no shelter, not enough food, harsh weather. This ain't Gilligan's Island my friends.

I've told you how this was such a simple plan. Now I will tell you how it was diabolical. It destroyed television as we had known it since its inception. It got huge ratings, partly because of the spectacle, partly because the audience became attached to ""the islanders"", and partly because people could feel better about themselves because each of us felt we would never sink so low.

Networks figured out that no longer do you need paid actors or writers or art design. Just find some random group of awful people in normal situations or normal people in awful situations and watch the feeding frenzy. And then it spread from the networks to cable. A&E, which once aired ""Breakfast with the Arts"" now shows stuff like Duck Dynasty, Dog The Bounty Hunter, and Hoarders. The Discovery Channel? Gone was investigative reporter Bill Kurtis and Walking With Dinosaurs, in with ""Naked and Afraid"" and ""Moonshiners"".

As for soap operas? Not exactly the apex of quality television, yet a guilty pleasure for quite a few, even myself in my college years. But it was scripted and required paid actors. Why pay Susan Lucci to act awful into her 60's on ""All My Children"" when you can get some Bridezilla to act like a rutting pig for free? So one by one the soap operas fell, until only a handful still exist.

Why my rating of 2? I'd give it a 5 for being a milestone in television history, although it's a bad milestone. I give it a zero for having any redeeming value whatsoever and for  influencing television for the worse - it's an absolute miracle that something as good and as original as Big Bang Theory could take root and thrive in this environment. 5/2 = 2.5. Rounding down it gets a 2.

It was great to see so many things about Survivor are still the same today.  From Jeff Probst as host, to the music, tribal council and the show's basic format of two teams, immunity and reward challenges etc.  What I was not expecting was how much the players have evolved since the first season.  It was hilarious to see ten people go to tribal and seven different names written down for the vote!  Like that would ever happen in today's game.

By the second season, most of the production styles were in place and continued through the seasons that followed, but here at the start the show is feeling its way, and it's interesting to see the slight differences in approach and presentation between this season and the rest. At the same time, one can get a sense of the evolution of those stylistic devices as this first season moves from first episode to last. If you're not a fan of the show, of course, all this probably doesn't matter. For those people, this would probably rate two or three stars.

2050027,4,B0001ZDKXI,"I became a huge Survivor fan starting with Season 2, and had never seen Season 1... until now! Not sure why I had never taken the time to see Season 1, but better late than never.

""Survivor - The Complete First Season"" (5 DVDs) brought quite a few surprises to me. Let's start with the obvious ones: the first season (aired in May-August, 2000) focuses much more on the actual survivor aspect of the game (trying the find food, dealing with the weather elements, etc.) and also the mind-blowing lack of strategy on the part of most players (but not Rich, the eventual winner). I must say I was a bit frustrated by that lack of strategy, given the later development of the game (I mean, Sean voting at TC on alphabetical reasons, which had a huge impact at one point). Jeff Probst is amazingly different from later seasons, more an observor rather than the interpellant we know him now. And the Tribal Counsils were so short! Really just to let them vote.

Other surprises, randomly: Rich, the self-proclamined gay guy, actually has a son! Kelly winning the last 5 ICs in the game, wow (not sure it's ever been done again). Rudy was a surprisingly weak player. Then Kelly choosing to take Rich to the Final 2, rather than Rudy, surely costing her the victory. Then there is Colleen, ""America's Sweetheart"" as Brian Gumble called her in the (excellent) Reunion show, who was 23 then but looked more like 16. She is 36 or 37 now! I wonder whatever happened to her. And then there is of course Sue's now infamous rant at the final TC against Kelly. Wow.

There is a bonus DVD (135 min.) of out-takes and various assorted unseen footage (such as the audition tapes) that is mildly entertaining. The real joy is seeing the humble beginnings of Survivor in its first season (not until the final TC did Jeff Probst utter the now classic words ""the Xth person voted off is""). Really enjoyed this, and I plan on re-seeing Season 2, which I haven't seen since it aired in Spring, 2001.",1370649600,,1975,4.542134831460674

2050031,4,B0001ZDKXI,"In this season Richard Hatch invents a thing called an alliance. While most of the other castaways don't even consider forming a group of people that will all vote a certain way, Hatch gathers a couple misfits to go along with his strategy. I suppose this is revolutionary and is why you should watch this season. I'm not really buying that because any person with half a brain would figure that out. When 4 people vote 1 way, people are shocked and don't really know what's going on. There is also an appearance of an idiot doctor named Sean who doesn't have enough courage to vote a certain way, so he adopted a strategy where he votes people out alphabetically. Hatch's crew knows this strategy and it really comes in handy on a certain vote. The music is terrible in this season and is so different from new survivors. This season is so much worse than season 2 Australia because season 1 is just so outdated and it seems like its 20 years ago. You have to buy this season if you are a fan of Survivor. You cannot call yourself a fan until you've seen every episode of every season. Basically buy this season because you have to.",1366934400,,1133,4.425837320574162

Sure as a first season, the show has yet to perfect its formula, but I feel the ride is still enjoyable (even knowing the results beforehand). The challenges, although simple, were very entertaining and I miss some of that simplicity. Tribal votes were always interesting and the cast was very enjoyable and generated all kinds of feelings/opinions. The show does slow in some areas, but being a big watcher of reality shows, I'm accoustemed to that. Almost every cast member that lasted till the jury phase was enjoyable and deserved the prize to some degree and the winner, without a doubt, deserves a pat on the back for the accomplishments he/she created.

Very enjoyable and one of the three seasons to start viewing the show. Highly recommended.",1350691200,,821,4.906474820143885

2050049,4,B0001ZDKXI,"This season of Survivor is a very good one.  The two tribes (Tagi and Pagong) battle it out.  Spoiler Alert!!!! One of the things I noticed is that after one of the tribes wins immunity, they lose immunity the next time.  The season is a good season but after watching some of the newer seasons this season looks a little more boring.  This season had a lot of funny moments, like The Super Pole 2000 (here's a little quote from Sean, who built it: It's got the mans grip.)  After the tribes merge you can figure out who is going home.  The whole season comes down to, in my opinion, THE MOST EPIC FINAL CHALLENGE EVER!!!!!!!!!! and Sue's snake and rat speech.  It is a season you will come back to every once in a while.  A Must Have Season.

P.S. In the finale watch Super Pole 2000 burn in the fire when the final two set their shelter on fire in sacrifice for ""thanking the island for letting them live there.""",1312416000,,914,4.267441860465116

2050052,4,B0001ZDKXI,"The first season of Survivor is so funny because these people came to the island without any semblance of strategy. They were appalled by the notion of ""alliance,"" and they didn't talk amongst each other about how they can work together to eliminate certain people. Richard Hatch thought to do this, and Richard Hatch won. Easily. Since then, the game has gotten far more complex, less about survival, and more about alliance-making. The downside to this season is definitely the lack of a strategy, but the upside is the focus on actual survival: obtaining food, boiling water, catching fish, dealing with the elements, . . . and this is what makes the season worth watching over and over.",1299456000,,690,4.8559322033898304
2050053,4,B0001ZDKXI,"What a terrific reminder of how it all began. Its been wonderful to see the first strategic move ever made in the game, to watch survivors compete without knowing how to play the game, and to see the turning points in the game that ultimately led Richard Hatch to victory. Jeff Probst is just a baby in this one. The game has evolved so much, including the level of involvement from Jeff. For example, in the earliest episodes, when the two tribes meet the day after tribal council, there's no announcement from Jeff about who was eliminated last night. There's no commentary by Jeff during an immunity challenge. At the climax of an immunity challenge there's no music to give the viewer a clue that the challenge is almost over, and no proclamation from Jeff like ""Tagi wins immunity!"" with both hands held above his head. They obviously got better with their microphone techniques with subsequent series, because at times, the contestants are a bit hard to hear over the sounds of the beach. Lighting at tribal council has also come along in leaps and bounds since this first series too, and obviously in more recent series, Jeff has taken on a much more significant role in interrogating contestants at tribal council. I must say though, I'm glad to have this series in my collection, given that it is the first one, and a very entertaining piece of nostalgia.",1298678400,,1364,4.7112970711297075
2050054,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I started with Survivor at the second season so had never seen this one before. I was familiar with some of the characters having watched the All Stars Season and of course knew what the outcome was. I found this series fascinating after watching recent series where alliances are the most important thing and are made on day 1 - it was refreshing to see people approaching the game in different ways having never seen anything like this before.
I loved how shocked everyone was when Gretchen was voted out and also that they were still not all convinced there was an alliance. The voting by the Pagong tribe at this Tribal council was hilarious when comparing to other seasons.
Richard Hatch was amazing throughout, I loved him. I really didn't see him as a particularly bad villain, he was very straight up and honest with what he wanted to do but played the game very intelligently. I was more annoyed with people like Kelly who whined and changed their mind all the time about what they were doing.
The whole season was very fresh and reminded me of series 2 in that there was much more focus on life around camp and survival aspects rather than all game play as the show is nowadays.
I didn't really warm to too many of the characters, Sean especially I thought was just foolish. Jenna I thought came across as very sweet someone who really enjoyed the whole experience, she was much more jaded by the time she competed in All Stars. Jeff was really funny how inexperienced and unsure he was with everything.

The dvd extras were great, I loved the audio commentary, it was hilarous. I really didn't like Gervase much in thw show but on the commentary he was great and Richard and Jeff were very funny. I would definately recommend this dvd for any Survivor fans.",1297814400,,1768,4.559748427672956

I remember catching some of the last episode of that season and recall the ubiquitous chatter around the water coolers that got me to watch the 2nd season and nearly every one after that. Having now seen the original, it puts the rest of the show in perspective. It was interesting (in hindsight especially) to see the origins of the alliance, the development of traditions and challenges, and the precursor of all the things that we now take for granted in the later seasons. Certainly worth catching all these years later if you've never seen it or even if you have.",1270598400,,684,4.661157024793388
2050060,5,B0001ZDKXI,"No one would have thought such an ambitious show would still be around ten years and 19 seasons later. As a longtime fan, this season remains one of the most near and dear. This season focuses on the physical struggles of living on a desolate island along with the daily grind in dealing with the castaways. There are no epic challenges or shocking blindsides to this season, but it still carries its own weight. To a newer viewer the first few episodes seem quite rustic both in terms of video quality and editing. However, the flow of the show grows with time and you become deeply rooted the the stories of each person in the game. After every person leaves you can honestly recall what impact they had on the game (not something you can say about more recent seasons). This is a must have for any true Survivor fan.

Survivor was filled with many great moments and great people, like stacy eating the bugs, gervase receiving a note that his wife had had a child, sadly when gretchen got voted off, cry baby jenna, the beautiful colleen and of course the survivor winner Richard.

2050083,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I remember back in summer of 2000 (was it really that long ago?) reading about a little show that CBS was putting on their summer schedule.  Since I've often thought about life abandoned on an island, I thought it would be interesting to tune in and watch.  Little did I know what I was about to get hooked on.

This show was not so much about surviving the elements, and I almost tuned out.  But I soon got caught in the political battle of surviving each other.  Thanks to the fabulous editing, I tuned in each week to see who would be voted out next.  And, as the season drew to an end, I hoped each week that the alliance would crack.  And each week, I was disappointed.  Still, Wednesday night, I never missed a show.

In many ways, this season defined this show.  It has become all about alliances and whom you trust.  If it hadn't been for Richard Hatch, who knows how this game would have been played in later editions.  Speaking of Rich, he was the man we all loved to hate; yet he deserved to win since he was brilliant at playing the game.  Of course, at the time, I was rooting for Kelly all the way.  And you will never be able to top Sue's snake and hawk speech in the final tribal counsel.

This season of this show has done more to change the American TV landscape then any other I know.  Not necessarily for the better (""Who wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire"" or ""Temptation Island"" anyone?)  Still, it entertains and sucks you in.

 I started watching survivor at season 4 , and haven't missed an episode since, so even though I knew who won, I was still very interested in seeing all the previous episodes...This does not disappoint...Season 1 was soooo Great...it had never been done before and was just so worth watching ( Colleen Haskell is a Goddess btw)

 To all the Survivor detractors I say: Before I started watching, I too thought it was all so dumb, But don't be all caught up in trying to put some ""reality"" tag on the show...who cares if camera's are always there...it is the interaction and drama and positioning and tactics Between the survovors that counts...Survivor is the greatest show on TV, and the Only show on broadcast television that I regularly watch, and I was once a naysayer myself...

 Best Quote: From Colleen Haskell (the sexiest survivor ever !!)

 This was right before they were going to play a gameshow like game...anyways Coleen says to Hatch ""I was thinking how great it is, we get to play a game show, though I was never any good with the clicker, then I was thinking Waaaiitttt a second, we are ON a game show""",1116633600,3,1255,4.647058823529412
2050085,4,B0001ZDKXI,"Hi. I am an original ""Survivor"" fan and watcher up to this day. Like the other reviewers said, this is the first and best season. I started watching this show at a friend's request at the second show when Sonja Christopher became the first ever Survivor casualty and I have been hooked ever since. I have checked the other reviewers and while people have asked the question that baffles many to this day (how did Richard Hatch win?), I point to episode 3 (which no one has mentioned) to be the turning point on the entire show and even the eventual finale!

As of this point besides being attractive, a bit cunning although a bit lazy, Stacy Stillman had emerged as a ""mind"" threat. Stacy and Rudy clashed as she exposed Rudy for what he was (a homophobic, anti-woman, closed minded man) and wanted him voted out right away. This episode saw the formation of the Rudy/Richard alliance which along with Sue lying and deceiving Stacy set the groundwork for this season and all others. Lying and deceiving would be part of all future survivors and not always the brightest players move on. Stacy who was a tribe hero for eating the bugs in episode 2 (pre- Fear Factor)was blindsided by Sue which allowed Rudy (who was nearly still voted off)to continue to nearly the end. For those who forgot and others who might be new to Survivor should note that Stacy would file a lawsuit after the show against the show's producers for allegedly telling the players who to possibly vote off early on. To this day Burnett, Probst, or even Stacy have never commented on the resolution of this. One thing is for sure, Stacy would have made a great opponent in Survivor All-Stars where Sue Hawk just wilted, but that is another review!",1112140800,2,1717,4.611111111111111
2050086,5,B0001ZDKXI,"The show has changed over the years...and not necessarily for the better. Watching the first season of Survivor, you can really see how the simpler, cleaner and more laid-back filming style worked wonders, turning a longshot reality show into the hottest series of the year.

Later editions, like Australian Outback and Survivor: Africa, tried to tinker with the format, adding more music and other bells and whistles...and eventually Survivor became what it is today (slick and processed). It lost the ""edge"" Survivor: Borneo displays, the unique feeling that you were staring reality in the face, and anything could happen at any given moment.

Also, back then the show focused on little things that meant nothing: people playing ukeleles, sitting around, swinging in hammocks. Today it seems as if every Survivor contestant's day is scheduled down to the minute. Episodes are edited to create fake crises and promote certain characters/storylines. Alliances are purposely covered up by the producers to keep viewers in the dark. With Survivor: Borneo, you get none of this.

I still like Survivor, and watch it every season, but season one is definitely the best. This DVD collection contains every minute of footage shown on TV, plus the ""Greatest Moments"" disc and some episode commentary. Well worth the money. Five stars!

2050087,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Being a late-comer to the ""Survivor"" series (only starting with ""Pearl Islands"") I was thrilled to see that they had decided to release the earlier series on DVD. Of course, after watching ""All Stars"", I knew who everyone (Rich, Sue, Rudy & Jenna) was and who had won the first series, ""Survivor: Borneo"". BUT, this did not take from my enjoyment of it one bit! Firstly, to those of you reading who have never seen this series (And if not, why?)BEWARE OF THE PACKAGING! It's unfortunate that on the back of the box-set it reveals the winner's name. Furthermore, each of the four discs of the actual series gives a synopsis of each episode, and, also, the name of the person voted off at each tribal council. Obviously the set is directed towards people who have seen it and are reliving the magic. The fifth disc (Yes, there are five!) is a special previously released disc of the greatest moments from the series (an excellent touch) and is well worth a watch. The fourth disc contains a few special features ('Survivors leave Los Angeles', 'David Letterman-Top Ten' & a 'Look back with Rich, Rudy and Gervase') but they're nothing to go mad about. On the other hand, the documentary entitled 'Survivor: The Phenomenon' (on the fifth disc) is good, with a little insight into the making of the series. Compared to some of the later series, I was amazed at how remarkably similar some of the elements were (the initial marooning of the survivors, for example), though I'm extremely glad that the producers decided to get rid of that ever-so-cheesy gong at the entrance to tribal council. Some of the challenges are simple, yet all are enjoyable, and there's something ever so raw about the camera-work that really seems to...well...work. The picture and sound quality are of the highest degree and make it so much more enjoyable. With four episodes played on each of the discs (excluding the last two) I found it really difficult to tear myself away from the television after one sitting. I now sit here twiddling my thumbs, patiently awaiting the release of ""Survivor; Austrailian Outback. For the mean time, I am very content to play ""Borneo"" over and over again.

It is when and ONLY when the subject does NOT know they are being filmed. Security cameras, hidden cameras, that sort of thing.

2050093,5,B0001ZDKXI,"No question, the most memorable moment of ""Survivor: Borneo"" was during the final tribal council when Sue Hawk unloaded on Kelly Wigglesworth.  When Sue told Kelly ""if I were ever to pass you in this life again, and you were laying there, dying of thirst, I would not give you a drink of water. I'd just let the vultures take you, and do whatever they want with you, with no ill regrets,"" everyone watching had their jaws on the ground.  When Sue finished her speech and made her plea for the contest to end the way Mother Nature intended it with Richard the Snake eating Kelly the Rat, I can remember thinking that they can do ""Survivor"" until the end of time and they will never top that moment.  Every time one of the jury members tells Jeff Probst that they want to make a statement rather than ask a question, they get judged against the Sue Hawk standard and they fail (It is like lighting the Olympic flame; no one will top using the archer at Barcelona).

However, when I watched ""Survivor: The Complete First Season"" again on DVD what was confirmed for me was that the most pivotal moment in the show came in the tribal council at the end of Episode 7.  This was not only when the road was paved for Richard Hatch to be the sole Survivor, but also when the course of American popular culture changed.  This is because once Hatch won the million dollars, his strategy of alliance and deception became the template for how future competitors would attempt to outwit, outplay and outlast the others on ""Survivor"" but on ""Big Brother"" and virtually every other reality game show.  But what people forget is that at the turning point in the series MOST of the castaways were playing the game quite differently.

Episode 7 was the first tribal vote after the merger and you probably remember that Gretchen, who was the most popular of the contestants and the one we thought personified the skills of a true Survivor.  But Gretchen was voted off because she had four of the ten votes cast.  The four who voted for her were (surprise, surprise), Richard, Kelly, Sue, and Rudy.  But do you recall the rest of the votes?  Greg voted against Jenna, Jenna voted against Gervase, Gervase voted against Susan, Sean voted against Colleen, Colleen voted against Richard, and Gretchen voted against Rudy (remember, nobody ever voted against Kelly).  In other words, the other six all voted for six different people.  But not only did the former members of Pagong all vote for different people, instead of targeting a member of Tagi, but Greg and Jenna both voted against Pagong teamamates.  All together now: What were they thinking?

Well, in retrospect, I think it is clear that what the former members of Pagong were thinking when they mereged with Tagi into Rattana, was that they really were now one tribe.  Needless to say, this is not a mistake that has been made since that day.  Consequently most ""Survivors"" since then have featured a reshuffling of the tribes before the merger, just to keep things interesting.  Unfortunately the commentary for these episodes on DVD is quite limited (but insightful for the first and last episodes), because I would have liked to have checked my hypothesis, which is that it was Gretchen herself, by word or deed, who propagated the idea that doomed first her and then the rest of the former Pagong players one by one by one.

My thesis is that this was an event of great cultural significance.  If Pagong had decided to target any one of the Tagi players, whether it was Rich or not, that would have been five votes to four and the steamroller would have been on their side.  I do not think they would have voted for Rich, because he was providing food, and since Gretchen voted for Rudy that would be consistent with the Pagong approach of getting rid of the member of the tribe who was contributing the least.  Play that token out to the end and Gretchen wins.  Given who would have won (most qualified) and how they won (voting off the weakest and not the strongest member), the course of popular culture and American civilization would have been changed and, more importantly, changed for the better.  Face it.  This country was not built on the idea of taking out the strongest or the best.  That is the goal, not the objective.  Make Richard Hatch the role model and we are heading for a bizarre dystopia no one ever would have expected.

The other thing that rewatching the original ""Survivor"" confirms is that Mark Burnett did a marvelous job of creating suspense when there was not any.  After Episode 7, which was furiously debated around the nation's ""watercoolers,"" the consensus was that unless the rest of the castaways wised up, the alliance of four was going to run the table.  Which they did.  But Burnett, aided by some the release of some computer alterred photographs, cut these episodes so that there was always a slim reed of hope that the alliance would be derailed.  But it never happened.  Who went home when the tribe spoke each week might have been a surprise, but it was never one of the alliance until they were the only ones left and started eating their own.

I almost always like to watch movies twice because I like to see how the end game is set up, and that same approach is what makes watching ""Survivor: The Complete First Season"" interesting.  Knowing the outcome informs your enjoyment and understanding, not only of how the game was being played that first time around, but also how it was editing for maximum effect.  One suggestion when you watch these episodes again: After each one go check out the CBS web site for ""Survivor: Borneo"" because they are all still up, and you can still access all of the information and extras, such as polls and stuff.  Frozen there for Internet eternity right now are the online poll predictions for the finale.  Rudy was the overwhelming favorite with 53.47%, with Kelly second at 22.54% and Susan third at 12.22%.  Richard Hatch was sitting at 11.75% and he ends up being the one with the million dollar check.  Now we know how he did it and what it has meant.",1098921600,33,6078,4.621973929236499

Unfortunately they fell short when it came to making this entire set uncensored, as the highlights DVD was.

2050095,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Having only picked up on Survivor for the screening of the Season One Grand Finale, I have been regaled ever since with stories of how groundbreaking and astounding the first series was.  I was thrilled when the complete season one was released on DVD and even happier to discover, living in Australia, I could actually play the discs thanks to my trusty karaoke machine!

On first glance, the most striking thing about Survivor: Borneo is the actual look of the show.  It seems so much more fresh and I don't know whether that's because of the way it was shot or because of the way it's been produced on DVD.  But it sure looks snappy!

It's been great to get see to some of the legendary players from the first season - Gretchen, whom I understand was highly favoured by American viewers, Colleen, the so-called sweetheart (she seems like your average college kid to me) and Greg the total whack job (what the... ?). It's interesting to note Jenna (Lewis) who, having recently returned in the All-Stars series, was a heck of a lot less jaded first time around.  Dare I say she even seemed cute!  Rudy is an absolute classic, but his screen time sure doesn't live up to his hype.  Never the less, we've been going round saying ""He's fat, but he's good"" whole lot lately.

The greatest mystery to me is Richard Hatch.  We've just finished watching Episode Eight.  If he's got a grand scheme, I can't see it.  He seems no more a puppet master than Johnny Foreskin (oops!) I mean Fairplay.  I'm disappointed to discover through an internet search that Burnett may have interfered with some of the voting outcomes of the first series.  That makes it easy for me to believe Hatch might have been assisted in his machinations.

Whatever, if you're a fan of Survivor, this DVD collection is a must have.  It's back to basics without a doubt and is a great way to understand the game more and expand your appreciation at the same time.",1092614400,,1928,4.561046511627907
2050096,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I admit that I did not understand the 'Survivor' hype when it first hit and never saw an episode. My review is for those, like me, who would like to take in the series, post-hype, and see for themselves.

It's hard to belive that this first aired in 2000 and the Mother of the reality-tv blitz that's available today. It certainly is one of the classier entries. It started off slow for me but once you hit the third episode, you're starting to anticipate the tribal councils and starting to figure out how the myriad 'alliances' between players will play out (or not).

Watching the show four years later you start to see how the press coverage of notable contestants took hold. Rich: the not so duplicitous (to me, anyway) and frank corporate-guy-turned-castaway. Susan Hawk, the Fargo-voiced salt mama who don't take no crap, ay? [Her infamous dress-down of Kelly put's Al Pacino's 'You're out of order!' speech in 'And Justice For All' to shame]I thought she went way overboard, but just getting to that moment is worth watching for. Colleen, the cute island sprite who talks like your loopy but fun cousin from summers past. Rudy, the Midwestern drone who does most of his on-screen commentary up to his neck in the sea but is rarely spotted, uh, working. Kelly, the Everygirl who doubts the convenience of alliances and thinks for herself at a time when nerves are fraying and things are getting more personal.

The four disc set and bonus DVD are a worthy purchase if you want entertainment, pseudo-travelogue and interest in how these people lived 39 days on an island to win a million dollars. Knowing who the winner is of this first series, as most do, will not detract from how that comes to be. I enjoyed the set and it definitely interested me in further editions. Credit is due to excellent production values and the stamina of the players. You'll feel good to pause the DVD and be able to get a sandwich and remember you have food to eat! Last note: As other reviewers have stated, be aware that the backs of each DVD cover list each player booted off per episode. Do not look at the back cover. If you missed this all on tv, you'll be as surprised as the original audience until the end.",1092614400,7,2203,4.586294416243655
2050097,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I have seen every single episode of Survivor since Survivor Australia. This first Survivor set the high standard which has made the series so popular. The format for all the series was determined in the first three days on Borneo. I haven't finished viewing all the Dvd's yet, the merge has just occurred however I am enjoying
the series more than I expected. The video quality is perfect and the extra commentary is interesting and amusing. Hindsight is 20/20 when you are viewing the show 3 years after you took part in it. None of the participants on the show had any idea how big it was going to be and how it would change all their lives. This is a well done, quality production.",1090022400,3,684,4.48
2050098,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I pondered long and hard if $40 was too much to pay for something I didn't know how many times I'd watch. The ultimate answer came after I spent it and realized it was well worth it. The sheer amount of hours in this, including the additional DVD is well worth it. Watching this show again just confirmed why I love the show in the first place and also shows how far it has come.
The players in this are all naive and only Rich seems to have anything planned. It's so interesting to watch again knowing all that I do about watching the series over it's many seasons. Season 1 still remains one of the best just because of how naive the players are.
It seems they already have the All Stars complete season planned for release in August, but I truly hope they plan on releasing the other seasons as well. I'd really love to see Survivor Amazon on DVD! In any case, this set is WELL worth it for any Survivor period.",1087776000,5,914,4.228571428571429
2050099,5,B0001ZDKXI,"One evening, I called my brother on the telephone and he blurted out that the Survivor final episode was on and he could not talk as he abruptly ended the call.  I was quite offended, after all, it was just a tv show.  It continued to be a sore spot with me until I was visiting him the evening the first episode of Survivor Thailand started and he forced me to watch it.  I had no idea what the show was about and even after the first night, I had to admit, I was intrigued enough to promise to keep watching it.  He swore it gets a lot better as the personalities and strategies develop.  By about the 4th episode, nothing would keep me from watching the show and I have watched all of the subsequent seasons.  I have wanted to go back and see the first few seasons.  But, only clips of the previous seasons were available.  That did not really interest me.  Finally, the complete first season was released.  After Survivor Allstars, I knew who the winner was and I was concerned that it would not be interesting knowing how it ends.  I have not been dissappointed, it is fantastic!  It is so much fun watching it without the commercials.  Each episode gives a brief intro summarizing the previous episode so you remember where you left off.  Unfortunately, it also gives you a glimpse of the next episode at the end which has lured me into watching it when I really did not have the time.  My only advice, don't read the back of the cases as they tell you who is voted off in each episode.  Otherwise, enojoy!  I hope CBS continues to release additional Survivor seasons on dvd.",1087171200,,1581,4.359589041095891
2050100,4,B0001ZDKXI,"As advertised.  Simply put, the season as you would have seen it on tv.  The box says all you need to know.",1085875200,3,107,3.8181818181818183
2050101,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I finally succombed to survivor fever back when it was first on tv during the merger episode. By then, I really didn't know enough from the earlier episodes to understand the moronic attitude of the anti alliance group, and to appreciate Hatch. I did not like him for years. However, I got my S1 dvd set this week and I am on disk 3 now. I LOVE THIS. What a great season.
Here are some observations.
Cheesy stuff they don't do anymore, that I think is great in these episodes:
1) the gong going to tribal council
2) the treasure chest full of ""money"" (my note: what happened to this money during the rainy tribal councils? They never show it soggy)
More on the filming:
During most of the challenges, you can see boats out at sea that are supporting the production. Most of the time, the cruise ship they used for the crew is parked at the horizon, clearly visible in the scene. I heard helicopter noise during the filming of the merger challenge, where pagong lost for the last time to make it an even 5.
It is VERY amusing to watch the voting after the merge. Pagong pagonged ITSELF. This is hilarious. I just finished the episode where Jenna gets voted on by her entire tribe, even though the alphabet voting put greg out.
Another observation: whenever Jenna was on a tribe, the tribe did happy things. Pagong was a happy tribe as was Chapera. I think Jenna is under appreciated as a player on survivor.
I miss them casting a wide age range of players. If they bring that back, it will make the dynamics more interesting. BB's game strategy was a train wreck. Sonja was a great lady. I loved her singing that funny song to hatch.
Gretchen was an interesting survivor, she understood the game, as did Greg. How come we don't hear about these contestants?
If you haven't watched the new dvd set, I recommend that you watch the first CD all the way through WITHOUT the probst et al commentary turned on. Then go back and turn on the commentary and watch E1 all over again listening to the boys talk about the scenes as they unfold. This is great stuff. I wish they had commented on EVERY episode with more of the cast.
This was probably the best $35 i have spent on entertainment in quite some time. I hope they bring all the seasons out on DVD.
What I wish they will do for future sets:
1)  after the credits for each episode, then show clips of the voting confessionals and ALL the insider clips that were on the CBS website each week.
2)  Have cast commentaries on EACH episode by cast members of that season that you can turn on or off, like they did for episode 1 on this set.
3)  Show audition tapes of cast members (I don't know if these are on this set, I am still watching disk 3)
Also for those purchasing this set, don't mistake the plastic on each CD case as something you have to rip off.  I was bone headed and discovered AFTER I ripped off the plastic on my case that it was to hold the cover in place.  The cd case itself was not sealed in plastic (dah).  Oh well.",1085702400,20,2980,4.303030303030303
2050102,4,B0001ZDKXI,"I never saw Survivor 1 and really regretted missing out, so I'm thrilled to get to see it now.  Yeah the suspense over who wins is gone, but watching the Macchiavellian manuervering and intrigue is almost more entertaining when you know its going to work.  My only gripe with this set is that its really lean on extra features.  How about some deleted footage?  How about more than 1 episode with a commentary? I just would have liked something more, but at the really good price (say compared to a season of CSI on DVD), I'm not going to complain.",1084924800,2,548,4.45
2050103,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Survivor Boreno is Richard Hatch.  It is amazing to watch all of the episodes and admire the way he dominated his season.  Truly, he was one of the best mental players to ever play the game.  He definitely deserved to win.
The Season begins with 16 strangers being case overboard off the island of Boreno in the South China Sea.  The castaways soon deal with rats, snakes and learning to deal with interpersonal relationships, which are essential to the game.  It was very interesting to see the people in this season have moral issues with the idea of an ""alliance,"" now the staple of the show.  Also, these castaways have MANY more amenities than the current castaways do.
As the 16 dwindle to 1, we see the beginnings of one of the best shows on television.  Stand out season 1 members:  Sue (who could forget the speech?); Gervase (eating bugs and rats); Jenna; Kelly; Rudy (one of the most original Survivors); and, as previously mentioned, Richard.
Can't wait for fellow Texan Colby and Season 2 to be available on DVD.",1084752000,7,1025,4.655555555555556

That is America. But to be so childish as to take the time
to go through all my reviews and give an unhelpful rating
is beyond stupid. An Unhelpful rating in my particular
review of Survivor is to be understood, feel free.
But viewer from earth was so upset that I did not like Survivor
and valued my opinion so much that he could not just ignore
a review that he did not agree with. Instead he had to stalk me
throughout amazon behind a curtain hiding his real name.
I placed this review because I do not like survivor. Most people acted like adults and either
ignored it or gave if a unhelpful rating.
But sadly too many are like this child, who can't accept a diferent opinion.",1084752000,4,727,4.27536231884058
2050105,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Well I like to think of myself as the biggest survivor fan there is. Who else would fork out 40 bucks for two of those buff things??? But anyways my point is, ever since the first episode I've recorded every single episode on VHS, so now I've got about 30 different tapes full of the different seasons laying around. Meanwhile all this time I've wondered when they're going to start coming out on dvd. So now they're here, the first season anyways, and they're sooo much better than watching the old tapes. the picture quality is outstanding and the commentary is great too. Hopefully they will continue with the rest of the seasons so i can throw all my old videos away for good...
And now that that is done with, i'd just like to say that it's really too bad that Amber won All Stars. Amber, who I think shouldnt have been an all star in the first place, definitely wasn't the ""best of the best"" It was really disappointing that most of the favorites like Colby, Rob C, and Ethan had to be voted out early leaving people less worthy like Amber, Jenna, and Alicia.
But anyways, CBS, i hope you keep coming with the great dvds!",1084665600,7,1127,4.3971291866028706
2050106,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I first started watching Survivor during season 2 so I was always confused when references were made to Survivor: Borneo.  But, now I know!  This season has all the raw emotion of the show, when it was still fresh.  Even though I love Survivor, this season seems to be less manufactured and the personalities more real.  I'm excited about the prospect of all seasons being released in this format, so everybody, purchase this DVD!

2050108,5,B0001ZDKXI,"Now, I know it's really not possible to write a review of this product being that I have yet to view it. All I can say is that I a really excited about this release. I am a huge fan of the show and my one regret is that I got on the boat late. The summewr of the original survivor was a turbulent one for me and I never got in on the action until late in the season. Now, when I discuss the show I always have to take a back seat when the events of season one are brought up. The release of the ""highlights"" DVD was not enough. Now, I will happily be able to view the season in its entirety, on a high quality DVD format loaded with extra's. So, I must say thank you to the producers for finally seeing the light on this needed release for fans of the show. Although I would have rather this release come before the airing of the All Star edition, I will gladly be one of the first to add this to my collection. And stay tune for my actual review when I finally get to view the product.
Edit(Update)
So I finally got my copy, ran home and popped the first DVD into the player. So this was the beginning of the adventure. What really shocked me at first is how different the show seemed. Everything from the camera styles and lighting seemed to come from a different place than the later seasons of the show. Jeff himself was no where near as polished, often stumbling over his now famous catch phrases. Not that I am complaining. There is a real raw and exciting feel to this edition. I got to meet such interesting characters as B.B. the crotchety old work horse and Ramona, whose queasy stomach in the early going may have cost her. My only qualm so far with the box set is the fact that they have listed who was voted off on each episode on the back of the box in the episode description. While I know a lot of the basics of what happened, it still would have been cool to keep a little suspense going for those of us who never saw the premiere episode. Well, more later!!!!",1084579200,5,1977,4.097938144329897
2050109,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I must admit, I didn't watch the first season of Survivor. I was so glad they came out with this in time for the break for the summer. It's really interesting to look back on the beginnings of Survivor and compare that to say Survivor All Stars. These people who you see on the first season, had no idea what they were in for, and that's why it seems more genuine, and more interesting then the other seasons. There were points in it that you could see crew members interacting with the cast, and Jeff Probst. The music is definitely more American from the first season. One immunity challenge in Season one has Piano and Techno music a la C.S.I. The main difference is that these people had fun. You see them enjoying themselves much more then you do now. They weren't making alliances from the very second they stepped on the beach. I love the current Survivor, but this DVD set really is awesome to watch. Highly recommended to any Survivor fan!

2050110,5,B0001ZDKXI,"I hesitated when I saw that the first season was going to be available on DVD, I thought!! Oh I don't know I already saw it, but when I started watching it again, I LOVE having it. I was able to observe all that I knew had happened, whey the survivors felt the way they did about each other when it was over, etc. Watching the show again was awesome, it was like I never saw the show. I remember parts of it but when watching it again believe it or not, I got excited, I got disappointed when they voted each other off, etc. It may sound Crazy, but true. I can't wait for the next one, PLEASE put the Australia one out, I can't wait to see it all, again. The Bonus DVD of the outrageous Moments wasn't really needed since now I have 2, but it is a bonus, all I can say is if you haven't seen the First Season or Have, you won't be sorry to see it again & again!! Thanks for the release. I hope they don't take their good old time with the next one!!!",1084406400,5,950,3.9274611398963732

Survivor has really been one of the foundations for the new breed of TV shows.
For Survivor fans I think some of the most exciting and interesting parts of this DVD is the actual progression of the show from things that seemed so strange (immunity tribal council,reward challenges, etc) to now being household names. Also these 16 individuals really were a great group and thats one of the things that make the show and Mark Burnett so sucessfull, the excellent casting.
Well this DVD does not dissapoint. The extras are fabulous you get to enjoy so many grwat features like the trip from LA to Borneo, the histerical no holds bard commentary from Probst, Richard and Rudy.
I'm hoping they will release the other seasons. Enjoy",1084406400,5,942,4.6467065868263475

Usually before every new season starts, I go back and re read the highlights of each previous season. It's amazing watching how with each new season, the survivors learn from the previous seasons. The All Star season is going to have a huge effect on the new seasons because we found out that having a bad reputation can kill you (lookin at you ROB C). I also think we'll be going back to alliances playing large roles in future seasons. Pearl Islands had almost NO alliances compared to previous seasons. I can't wait for the other seasons to be released on DVD. Colby storming through Australia, Ethan,Lex and Big Tom dominating Africa, Vecepia owning Marquesas, Brian controlling Thailand, Rob C and Matt using each other in the Amazon, Rupert and Jon battling in Pearl Islands and Everyone at once on All Stars..
