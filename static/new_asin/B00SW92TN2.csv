6993510,5,B00SW92TN2,"Wonderfully amusing Warner Bros. cartoons - all with musical themes, primarily classical and jazz.  Includes all the memorable Bugs Bunny operas and several gems I've never seen.  Some of the older classics are nearly 80 years old and still very entertaining.  Defines ""timeless"". Hours of laughter and amusement for a crowd usually absorbed in Pokemon episodes, and for their parents...  Provides old school musical exposure difficult to find elsewhere these days without being boring or pedantic.  Perfect for long road trips this summer.",1434153600,14,540,5.457831325301205
6993511,5,B00SW92TN2,"A great gift. That is all I need to say. It is some of the best looney tunes collected in a great package. Every musician you know will love it, great for kids, and even if you own the golden collection (Which a few of my sets deteriorated from age) it is great to just pop in and let it play.",1433721600,6,293,3.819672131147541
6993512,2,B00SW92TN2,"Don't get this if you own any LTGC DVD's as all the cartoons on this disc (with the exception of Rhapsody in Rivets & Nelly's folly) has been previously released. As a fan of these cartoons, I'm disappointed that Warner Brothers cannot put out new to DVD shorts, but instead has to double dip. However, I suppose that's understandable as due to low sales of the Platinum releases, Warner Brothers has no remastering budget to re-master other shorts that haven't seen the light of day on DVD. Is this really the end of Classic Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies on DVD &/or Blu Ray?",1430438400,36,575,4.647058823529412

6993521,5,B00SW92TN2,"A lot of Warner Bros cartoons had music but the ones on this DVD are some of the best.  While these have been included in many of the collections this disk puts them all in one place.  There are a couple, Nellys Folly and High Note, that I had never seen before.  I am a long time Warner cartoons fan since I grew up in the 1940s and 50s when the cartoonists in Termite Terrace were at their peak.

6993525,5,B00SW92TN2,"So glad I was able to find this. Not only does it have on it my absolute favourite Looney Tunes, but others that I either don't remember or  have never actually seen, which are also hilarious and absolute genius. And, as for the music, wonderful and I can imagine how this particular collection would be a great way to introduce children to such beautiful pieces of music from an early age. Laughter is for sure the best medicine and my husband and I are benefiting so much from being able to watch these whenever we want. The world could do with having more of such tnowadays. As always, great service and prompt delivery from Amazon.",1489190400,4,635,4.521739130434782

6993528,3,B00SW92TN2,"They omitted the fantastic Baton Bunny, Bugs as Stowkowski where he breaks the baton (he never used one).  The Long Haired Hare, Notes to You, and Mouse Masurka.  Dumping these for those with mundane music and much less humour.",1480550400,2,227,4.794871794871795

6993530,2,B00SW92TN2,"OK...I bought this DVD for when I have to substitute teach in Music or band class and they always just watch a DVD anyway.  Well...I can't show this.  Almost all of the cartoons were too violent with guns, etc.  as well as showing characters smoking, drinking, etc. so in this day and age it wouldn't be appropriate.  I remember just a few of the cartoons on this DVD, but didn't remember the ""inappropriate"" things in them...maybe I was just too naive as a child to remember?  I guess if you're getting this to see old Looney Tunes that you haven't seen in years, then sure - go ahead, but not much on this that I think is OK for kids...and yet I saw them as a child and survived, so who knows?  Just letting parents know",1478044800,6,722,4.272058823529412

6993535,3,B00SW92TN2,Some really cute depictions relating to the music. Only complaint is that one video follows immediately without a chance to stop or mark where one leaves off.  There are over 20 cartoons here.,1457740800,,192,4.818181818181818

6993537,3,B00SW92TN2,"I'm glad Warners finally put this out... I've been waiting a long time for an all-music themed Looney Tunes DVD to show my music classes at school. I only showed them a few cartoons and they really liked it. It also has a tribute to Carl Stalling, the composer, which is interesting to see for music classes. Whether we admit it or not, much of the classical repertoire of music we know has come to us through cartoons and films. In cartoons such as these, the music is right upfront.

As with all Warner Brothers cartoons DVD releases, the choices of cartoons is a mixed bag. There are truly some classics that are hilarious and there are also some lesser known cartoons. It's annoying because they've left out other classic music cartoons that really should be on here. If this DVD was half the price, I wouldn't mind. But it cost me almost $20, so I'm less impressed.

Finally, I think most or all of the cartoons have already been released in the various collections made available over the years, so there may not be a reason for most collectors to get this DVD.",1451433600,4,1067,4.494845360824742
