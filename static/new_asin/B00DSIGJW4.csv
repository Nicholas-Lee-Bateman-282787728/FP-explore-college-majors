8597186,1,B00DSIGJW4,"This German blu ray edition [region B/2, Koch Media] does not play on my fairly new region-free modified U.S.A. player. The disc itself has no scratches and appears to be authentic--not a bootleg. I updated my player and set it properly to region B/2 (as well as A & C), yet the blu ray would not play. I tried other region B/2 blu rays and B/2 dvd's I own, yet they worked fine. I couldn't find any online forums discussing my blu ray issue, but it may be that this entire blu ray production lot is defective on region-free players. Therefore, buy this German Dreamkeeper edition [region B/2, Koch Media] at your own risk.
As for Dreamkeeper the film, I love it. It is a series of exciting, relatable American Indian stories. The individual tales are part of a larger frame narrative. Overall, the film shows an honest attempt to depict both modern and traditional Native American cultures while tackling some unique, hard-to-address issues. And we also get to see the late John Trudell, A.I.M. leader/activist and poet, along with a truly wonderful cast of players. Dreamkeeper definitely deserves an American blu ray release.",1523232000,,1128,4.819587628865979
