8190478,5,B000PC6YTO,"Rissing Damp Series 4 was released in 1978. It stars Frances De La Tour as the hilariously funny  Miss Jones. She plays a tenant continuously pestered by her landlord. It is set in a seedy boarding house, with all the other fynny tenants. A classic British sitcom. Fans of Vicious will love the early appearance of Vi the most.",1472947200,,327,4.5423728813559325

8190480,5,B000PC6YTO,"This video was hysterically funny, if you understand the English sense of humour and wit. However the sound quality was such that it did make understanding the characters difficult, despite their accents and the fact that they speak very quickly.
Wish the entire series was available. This is only 1 season's worth.",1374796800,,315,5.076923076923077
8190481,5,B000PC6YTO,"I love the english humor. The main character is so socially awkward and it adds to the situations he gets himself into. It's set in a run down ""flat"" apartment complex he runs. The other tenants put up with him the best they can.",1364256000,,229,4.2272727272727275
8190482,5,B000PC6YTO,We watched this when we were living in UK and enjoyed the humor then as we do now.  Two words,1357689600,,93,3.65
8190483,5,B000PC6YTO,"Rising Damp is the best of British Comedy. Leonard Rossiter, the landlord, is his usual delightful self.  If you are ready for a good laugh, watch this series.",1267401600,2,159,4.678571428571429
8190484,5,B000PC6YTO,"This is  still a wonderful series but the emphasis on its characters has changed. It has always been the Leonard Rossiter Show but now more so. Alan (Richard Beckinsale) is no longer in the cast. I believe he died. Now we see the other three of the cast interacting almost continuously. Still a great show, just slightly different. Definitely worth buying.",1227398400,,356,4.836065573770492
8190485,5,B000PC6YTO,"I am from london. I remember thinking this was funny back in the 70s then got hold of it again. I haven't laughed so long and hard in years. But you got to have a feel for british humour. If you're not sure you do,get hold of Faulty towers. It has great reviews by americans on amazon. If you like that ,get Blackadder which many say is very funny and they understand the accent. Rising Damp ,you may have to have a good ear because the accent is slightly northern england. My american friend watching it with me said she couldn't always understand what he was saying(so would have missed the facial expressions that go along with it too)These comediens have really funny ways of taking the mickey out of themselves and others in a cynical way. But this doesn't mean sarcastically mean .Far from it. Yet the barbs are sharper than Are you Being Served. Rising Damp is  about a seedy slum landlord(Rigsby)and his 3 tenants. One is a romantic wallflower of a women who Rigsby is always trying to get into bed. Next is a posh african student who is more british than the british. But he's black! Rigsby is somewhat racist. Yes this sounds politically incorrect but don't worry he is always getting put in his place! And the woman has a crush on him. Then a student who Rigsby considers effeminate because he blow-dries his hair and wears rollers at times though he is not gay and the most normal out of all of them. I think Rising damp is far more funny than Faulty towers and Blackadder but then i'm a brit and also not fazed by the slight northern accent of Rigsby.",1183766400,9,1564,4.430555555555555
