8463982,5,B005BFM7Z0,A favorite movie as a teenager to rent from my local public library in Escondido on VHS tape in the late 1980's.

8463984,5,B005BFM7Z0,One of the most exciting war stories on film. The true telling of Australian Lighthorsemen making a bold charge on the water rich stronghold at Beersheba during World War I is made even more compelling by Mario Millo's brilliant musical score. One of the best!,1492214400,4,260,4.8
