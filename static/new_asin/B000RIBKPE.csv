8200828,1,B000RIBKPE,"Beware! This is not a film version of Gogol's ""Dead Souls"". It is a separate work, (very) loosely based on various works of Gogol. Very good production values and excellent acting, but no subtitles, so be aware of what you're getting into here!",1185580800,4,244,4.6976744186046515
