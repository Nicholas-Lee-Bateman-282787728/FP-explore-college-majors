674317,5,6303504779,Yoga with Linda Arkin provides several yoga routines lasting 30 to 45 minutes ranging from relaxation to stretching to strength building.  My favorite is the stretching routine which helps to relieve stiffness and keeps this senior citizen more comfortable.  Linda and her partner model the poses but she advises modifications to adapt to various levels of fitness. I lose interest in most programs but have been able to keep up with the stretching routines because of the benefits.  It is almost as good as a massage.  I have given the Yoga with Linda Arkin DVDs as gifts.,1273190400,,573,4.876288659793815
674318,5,6303504779,"This DVD got me back into yoga after almost ten years of avoiding yoga due to bad wrists.  Linda Arkin has a calm voice and the three routines on this DVD are great, flowing naturally from pose to pose, quite unlike some of the Yoga Journal tapes with Patricia Walden which are more like a random assortment of poses.  The one section I omitted when I first started practicing was the downward dog section in the ""Yoga for Strength"" workout, but after doing these routines for about a month was able to do downward dog correctly without hurting my wrists.  I had constant back pain before I started yoga, and even after one day of Linda Arkin's DVD, the back pain was gone.  Her focus on breathing is very calming as well and useful as I have moved on to more intermediate workouts.

The one drawback to this DVD is that the routines are fairly easy, and I outgrew them pretty quickly.  I wish strongly that Linda Arkin had made some intermediate yoga videos, because she is a great instructor and not nearly as irritating as many of the other video yoga teachers out there.",1171756800,,1074,4.482051282051282
674319,3,6303504779,"This has three programs, Flexibility, Strength & Relaxation + Rejuvenation. They are set outdoors with muted light music & nature sounds. Linda Arkin looks to be in her early 40s to late 50s, speaks fast & hurried in the intros, but her voice over is much better. Almost all poses are held for 10-20 seconds. She tells you benefits in a western way, how to keep alignment & never speaks about eastern or spirituality. She could give more cues about body placement so those who like detailed instruction might be frustrated by her slow late in the pose instruction on body placement. She does have a decently calming voice over, slow & unhurried, the music is barely audible, but since her voice is calming, you barely notice. Each of the 3 programs has the help of Linda Hiller (who models the more advanced ways of doing the pose) who is in her late 30s to late 40s.

The Flexibility comes with 9 min of intro set at the beach, including helping to find your proper alignment posture when standing, sitting & lying down. She also teaches deep yogic breathing she calls the ""whisper breathe"". There is a sitting series which includes seated forward bends, knee to chest, twists, wide legged stretch & butterfly. There is also a standing series which include side bends, side angle, triangle pose & eagle. That's all the poses that are done since these are done in a sequence & that sequence is repeated 3x. It ends with a sitting arm stretch, lying down spinal twist, breathing into middle section & 1 min of corpse pose. The whole thing is 47 min including the 9 min speaking intro.
The Strength program also has an almost identical intro for 8 min & set in a forest. It starts with shoulder rolls w/bend elbows, cat/cow pose, lifted opposite arm/leg in cow pose, semi crunches with legs bent the 1st time & lifted 2nd time. The next sequence is done 2x, starting with lunges on each side with arms on floor or up for advanced, regular plank, downward dog & child's pose. The stomach down sequence is done 3x: cobra, locust done 1-legged, then both legs, then both legs & arm & last, child's pose. Standing poses are done 3x: warrior 3 (leg leg stand, each side), standing forward bend, warrior 2 both sides, plank, downward dog, mountain pose. It ends with arm stretches, seated spinal twist, lying down twisted leg twist for 3 min with 1 min corpse pose.
Relaxation has 5 min of intro of posture with her alone. This program is her talking real time, no voice over so she's constantly speaking. It starts with forward bends, wide legged bend with bent elbows, head rolls. Seated, head bends with lifted arm, facial contractions, palms to eyes, shoulder rolls, arm stretches & slight side bend, triceps stretch, spinal twist, ankle rolls, wide legged one leg stretch, head rolls w/knees up, butterfly, mid-torso breathing, one legged forward bend & then twist, indian style forward bend, lifting foot slightly in that pose & abdominal breathing. Lying down, knee to chest, butterfly lying down & twisted leg spinal twist for a total of 40 min. The meditation is 4 min.

I did find her voice somewhat soothing, she does cue YOUR left/right, not hers, there is close captioning for those hearing impaired, this is good for the older generation to see older people doing it & not using age as excuse why they can't be flexible, I do feel she has some decent body awareness, it's great for people who don't want any spiritual/Eastern information, just yoga cut/dry for stretching & strength & somewhat taught to blend breath with body movement.
I didn't like is her doing sequences 2-3x, I felt she should have just held the poses longer or done them 2-3x in a row. She didn't give enough focus on breath, sometimes she wouldn't mention it at all, the poses were never done in a flowing/vinyasa way, but more like a gym/stiff hatha yoga style. I see other reviews have been put/scared off by really flexible yoga teachers on other dvds which I find incredible. I don't expect to be able to do it as well as them, but I rather learn by them then someone who can't since it means THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING & more BODY AWARENESS then those who can't do a simple sitting forward bend. In the past 5 years EVERYONE has jumped on the yoga dvd bandwagon to make $$, even those who have no business teaching.
Interesting Note: I did this once when I first got it at the date shown, but now in 2007, I did the flexibility & strength programs again (though only did poses 1x each - I find repeating sequences monotonous) and I got a backache for 10 min & stiff back feeling for another 20 min. I did not even have any back stiffness before doing the yoga dvd. I think I did the first time as well, but I thought it was a fluke. I never get backaches from any of my other yoga dvds (except Rodney Yee's Yoga for Back Care ironically enough) & I've been doing yoga for 5+ years though dvds. I also never get backaches in my daily life & also can touch my nose to the ground in butterfly (knees on ground as well, feet all the way into the groin) all my life w/ease & that pose is for stretching the lower back & hips.
Try renting it online or your local library first.",1150156800,13,5158,4.509615384615385
674320,2,6303504779,"This is a nice DVD series, however, it goes too slow for me.  Not that I am in to power yoga that much, this one tends to drag on a bit.

Flexibility session is nice, but slow, not much challenge. Poses are extremely easy and change at new scene.

Relaxation session is the worst.  It has no flow whatsoever, just goes from scene to scene as she changes poses.  Way too much explaining and not enough doing of the exercises.  I found myself yawning alright, but not from relaxation, but from sheer boredom and repetitive waiting for her to go into the next pose.

Strengthening session is better, and probably the best of them all.  Linda's flows are a bit better, yet still pretty basic and easy.  The poses, I feel should have been held longer for optimum fatiqueing of the muscles.  Overall though, not a bad session.

This series would be good for the absolute beginner, however, you must keep your eye on the tv screen as linda doesn't always cue that well.  Her voice is soothing, and the scenery and music are calming.  If you are totally inflexible and are worried about balance and weight issues, or are in your senior years, this would also be a good DVD series for those people.

For those looking for more or a bit of a challenge this isn't it.  This Series is extremly basic and the poses are repeated over and over, with little variation.  The workout sessions are also very short for my needs.  Only about 30 minutes of actual poses, with 10 minutes of instruction for a total of 40 minutes.  You won't learn many Yoga Asana's with this DVD series, but it can be good for the few little reasons stated earlier.  That's about it!",1127347200,2,1643,4.453020134228188
7849568,4,6303504779,"Nice yoga dvd, for beginners, because she explains a lot about each pose and how you should be positioned",1454976000,,105,4.578947368421052
7849569,5,6303504779,"Terrific. Three full yoga workouts on one dvd. You can use the main screen to choose which one you want to do or mix and match. These are full workouts. I like the relaxation and flexibility the most. The strengthening workout is definitely for strengthening, it does make demands on muscles and joints. That portion can be worked up to or you could avoid any poses which hurt any joints. If you are already in shape, the strengthening one will still put you through your paces. I love that this dvd and I love Linda Arkin. She is a great teacher. Another aspect of this tape is that Linda Arkin shows the basic pose and her friend Linda does an advanced version of each pose. You can clearly see each lady and follow along. Cool downs included at the end of each program.",1431216000,,772,4.405594405594406
7849570,5,6303504779,Very easy to follow. Very complete and thourough.,1421107200,,49,5.25
7849571,4,6303504779,"Why doesn't Linda Arkin put her ""Natural Body Tune Up"" on DVD? I would buy a handful of them as Christmas gifts. This particular series is decent, but certainly nothing like ""Natural Body..."" That one was the highlight of my day. This series feels like little more than a workout.",1419033600,2,280,4.62
7849572,5,6303504779,"3 different sessions on 1 video. I have been practicing yoga for 10 years and still love Yoga with Linda Arkin.  I had 2 of the 3 on VHS, so I have been using these sessions for a long time.  Linda reminds you that yoga is for everyone, young and old, twiggy and tree trunk.  If you are looking to start yoga or need a less intense yoga practice, definitely give this set a try.",1363737600,3,378,4.013333333333334
7849573,5,6303504779,"Linda is my favorite yoga instructor of all time. I started with a VHS tape years ago & was so pleased to find one of her collections on DVD. I enjoy the meditation at the beginning of the segment that gets you in a relaxed & focused frame of mind. The sessions are easy to follow with room to grow into as your skill levels increase. She goes through each pose thoroughly allowing for beginner to intermediate levels to participate comfortably.

Linda's teaching style is very warm & approachable & the lessons are easy to pick & choose from in this comprehensive collection. Her videos are a regular part of my home practice & allow me to stick with it when I don't have time to get into the studio. Advanced yogis may not be challenged but this is perfect to start your practice, return to it after an absence or add to your class schedule. She's definitely worth the 5 star rating :)",1354838400,3,887,4.408536585365853
7849574,1,6303504779,"I have had this DVD for some time,  now I know why I rarely use it.  She often moves into a pose without giving you the instruction.  Once in the pose, she will
tell you some of the movement.  The friend is usually in the ""extended"" version of
the pose, which is different.  She explains her movement.  If you are a beginner -
you do not need the extended version yet.  Linda usually has great DVDs, but in
all honesty, I think having the friend there, was distracting to her and did make
her put too much emphasis on the friend.  The third area of the DVD is more like
a warm up - and probably should have been the very beginning part of the DVD to help you warm up for the extended poses.  Linda's ""Natural Body Tune Up"" is fantastic, but unfortunately is only available on VHS.  Sorry! - this one - just
does not get it for me.  If she would completely redo the verbal part of the DVD
and give actual instructions for each move - this would be fantastic.  Unfortunately, she is too busy talking and misses most of the needed instructions.
By the time she does remember - they have actually already moved into the pose and
you are behind.  You get out of position - trying to watch the video - just to stay current with the actual moves.",1351468800,2,1239,4.1991525423728815
7849575,4,6303504779,"This DVD is great for a beginner. Some of the poses where more difficult than others, balance being my problem. I think with practice, that will improve. There wasn't alot of Yoga Lingo, it was pretty simple and easy to follow. I felt great when I finished and plan on making this DVD part of my exercise routine.",1348185600,,313,4.413793103448276
7849576,5,6303504779,"My boyfriend had the VHS tapes of two of these workouts.  We like the DVD because it's easier to find the segment we want to use.  The flexibility and strength sections are our favorites.  I like that they are broken up into 4.5 minute segments, that way I can do a little or a lot as time allows.  Yoga is such a great exercise, it really promotes the mind-body connection.",1346976000,2,374,4.3
7849577,3,6303504779,"She does have a nice tone, and she describes the poses well, but her cueing is awful! She'll say, ""Inhale,"" then pause, so I inhale, then she'll ""...as you lift into the pose."" She talks so much about form, that she doesn't tell you when to switch or release--even in poses where you are supposed to be looking at the floor. So, you have to constantly watch, which ruins your form. Maybe if you were to do the program several times and memorize it (or if you have a good sense of timing on your own), this would be okay. The series are generally pretty solid.",1312588800,,559,4.283018867924528
