8313935,3,B001JXQA9W,"This is an instructional film about ground combat aimed towards law enforcement professionals - or at least so it seems at first. At the beginning of the film, everything seems to be all right, as the instructor for example analyzes the pros and cons of open vs. closed guard, and he instructs that the open guard is better because it offers better protection against gun grabbing attempts. The first half of so of the film is OK, and the techniques seem to work without warm ups or extensive practice. As we (police defensive tactics instructors, that is) all know, cops are mostly lazy in practicing defensive tactics, so it's makes sense to teach techniques they can master with realistic amount of practice.

The second half of the film is more like regular BJJ with uniform on. For example, Bland teaches five submission techniques in the film, and all of them end with the suspect tapping out. There is no instruction on how to maneuver your opponent into handcuffing position after you have made him tap out. I don't know if Bland expects that a referee of some sort suddenly materializes at this point to end the fight. Folks, in the street, cops are that referee! Actually, there is no mention of using restraining devises at all in the whole film, which is a major drawback in a film aimed at LEO market. On the other hand, he mentions using less lethal weapons during the first half of the film.

The production of the film is on the other hand quite good, but on the other hand the disc the film comes in is totally blank outside. There is no text on the disc, not even the name of the film. Also, the cover of the DVD case is scruffy, giving a bad first impression. But the main issue is the actual content of the DVD, and that is produced very well. The techniques are taught well and there are enough repetitions for the viewer to understand the techniques. Also, on some occasions they have shown some techniques from various angles to further help the viewer to see the nuances of the technique.

8313936,5,B001JXQA9W,"Lockdown Ground Survival/Police Ground Fighting Defensive Tactics is law enforcement training media that is done right!  The DVD production is professional - with regard to both presentation and subject-matter!  This is a no-nonsense, genuine, straight forward and realistic approach to tactical training (in this volume, groundfighting) within the law enforcement environment - a rare gem in the marketplace!  The focus is upon re-establishing the tactical advantage when the fight goes to the ground.  The goal is control of the subject to effect the arrest - not a sport tap-out, or rolling around on the ground in an effort to prolong the ground fight!  I encourage Lockdown's continuation of this training series and I believe that it will become a standard within the law enforcement training archive/reference library for years to come!  Support Lockdown's efforts to provide this quality of training - by purchasing their DVDs - and I am sure that they will deliver with future releases!",1265846400,,995,5.305732484076433
8313937,5,B001JXQA9W,"I purchased the Arrest Control from Lockdown in May, it was a great video. This Ground Survival DVD has met my expectations! these guys are great. I have purchase many Police training and self defense DVDs and they all look like they were filmed with the familiy camcorder. These guys have professionally produced their videos and the result is a fantastic High quality DVD that will surely turn heads in the LE world.

Mike Blands experience as a Police Trainer and Skill as a Brazilian jiu-Jitsu Black Belt are clear, and his instruction is awesome! The guest appearance by Lockdown member Russ Mettke really completes the video.

Good Job guys!

GET THIS DVD!!!!!",1225584000,,666,4.876106194690266
