5683695,5,B00C12ZIN4,"My mom saw this on PBS and was fascinated.  When I saw it was on DVD, I bought it, to watch, and so mom could watch it again.  Dad was in WW II (in Japan) and an uncle was in hospital for almost 5 years after injuries from Battle of the Bulge.  I was intrigued, and, like mom fascinated by what this group of men accomplished with ""arts and crafts"" and trickery.  Amazing!",1377475200,,372,4.054794520547945

5683700,5,B00C12ZIN4,A very fascinating revelation of heretofore classified World War II deception.  The successful tricks by the US Army to mislead the Germans was told brilliantly by the surviving participants along with the videos showing the equipment and techniques in use.  If possible this deserves 10 stars instead of the maximum 5 stars.,1374105600,,325,5.230769230769231
5683701,5,B00C12ZIN4,"I had been waiting for this to come out ever since my client told me about the unit and that a documentary was being made about it.  He was a radio man in this unit.  It is an amazing story, and was so well presented. This is a must see! I even saw my client in it twice.",1372204800,16,271,3.6551724137931036
5683702,5,B00C12ZIN4,"This film tells the story, kept secret for nearly 50 years after the war, of a small WW2 unit of artists, actors, sound engineers, and ""regular guys"" who conducted missions designed to deceive the Nazis in France after D-Day.  Interviews with surviving veterans (all with a twinkle in their eyes as they talk about the ""fakery"" and the ""trickery"" they perpetrated), remarkable color film footage from the period, beautiful artwork created by the artists during their down time, impressive graphics which make the deceptions clear, and a wonderful narration by Peter Coyote (who makes you believe he knows everything there is about the Ghost Army and wants you to know it too--and care passionately about it!), make this a film not to be missed.  I have watched it numerous times, and told my family and friends about it, and everyone who has seen it has told their friends.",1372032000,50,873,4.891891891891892
5683703,5,B00C12ZIN4,"I sort of stumbled upon The Ghost Army on PBS by accident. Since the word ""ghost"" almost always catches my eye anyway, I was intrigued to find out what The Ghost Army was all about. When I discovered it was about WWII history, another area that interests me, I stopped channel surfing and tuned in. Great move on my part. I was amazed listening to the stories of how artists, some who went on to become quite well known, contributed to the war effort in an very unusual manner. Even Bill Blass served in this particular company of the Army! (And contrived his logo while in service.) It was super interesting to learn how they came up with the trickery they did. Highly recommend investing an hour of your time to watching this bit of history being recounted and preserved.",1369612800,68,773,4.5285714285714285

5683716,5,B00C12ZIN4,"easily 5 stars, I can only imagine how hilarious the conversation will be if a few soldiers went to their drill-sergeant telling him we want to help win the WWII via fine art. This documentary is about winning wars via fine art. The idea was approved and given a high priority by  Dwight D. Eisenhower himself. Truly an intelligent artistic tale of heroism, These few soldiers helped disguise our military installation. And on the battlefield using inflatable tanks, they posed as formattable American attacking forces to divert the German forces to attack them, allowing the real American forces to attack uncontestedly. despite the old age of the artists/ soldiers narrating this movie still, have a spark of intelligence and wit, most of them went on to become renowned national artists in America.",1511740800,,801,5.068181818181818

5683722,5,B00C12ZIN4,"MRE 2017.10.22: Finally, an aspect of WWII that has not been rehashed 100 times already.  The Ghost Army has been referenced, in passing, in many documentaries, primarily in relation to Patton's decoy ""corps"" prior to D-Day.  This goes into much more detail and the many interviews with members of the Ghost Army are a delight.  Seeing the sketches they made during their free time was a real bonus.  Very watchable documentary--highly recommended.",1508630400,,448,5.180555555555555

5683727,5,B00C12ZIN4,I was aware of the Ghost Army but only as it pertained to the allies attempt to make Hitler believe we were not landing at Normandy but rather at another location.

5683729,5,B00C12ZIN4,"This is a wonderful informative documentary of one of the most important units of the US Army. Most people never heard of the Ghost Army because its existence was kept secret.
One of the ways to win a war is deception. If it is possible to make the enemy think we are in one place and they concentrate their forces against this place, while we are in another place and attack from there, we have a better chance of winning the war. This concept of deception was used by the United States against the Germans from June 1944, when the Allied forces invaded at Normandy to March 1945 when the Allies forced the German forces beyond the Rhine River. The Ghost Army was involved in twenty battlefield deceptions.
There were three techniques that were used. One was visual. Inflatable rubber tanks, jeeps, artillery, planes, tank tracks, etc were placed at certain point which the enemy airplanes could see and think that an entire division was assemble there.  Second was sonics, creating noises that made the enemy think that thousands were at an area; such as the sound of people talking, sergeants screaming at men, tanks moving, etc. The third was radio, the Allies knew that the Germans were listening to Allied broadcasts, so they gave out misinformation on the radio.
It is estimated that the deceptions of the 1100 men who worked in the Ghost Army saved between 15,000 and 30,000 Allied lives. Their work was kept secret for forty years. The men could not even tell their wives. The reason for the secrecy was that the US thought it might have to fight the Russians and the US did not want the Russians to know about this effective device.",1505606400,2,1642,4.662068965517242
5683730,4,B00C12ZIN4,"It showed a lot of film of the actual 23rd and offered a lot of new info. about their part in the war.  I didn't have to fast forward but once due to repeating same info.  It's nice to know, wouldn't find a need to see it twice.",1505520000,,228,3.7291666666666665

5683733,5,B00C12ZIN4,"Great information here. Ingenuity, working towards common objectives, betting your life on your team's creation... they have it.  Not an overly sentimental look at their part in the war; they took incoming fire, too, and it pained them. But it drove them as well. This was the frontier of whole new ranges of technology. Not the cutting-edge, the bleeding-edge! And they kept the great parts of the Alliance that prevailed: Their sense of purpose, adventure, fun, curiosity, laughter and trying again.  A great tribute to not only the men we meet, and the ideals that inspired them. What they fought for and what was forced to be beaten in war. It was much more, bigger than I ever knew. Worth every minute.",1505174400,,707,4.786885245901639

5683752,5,B00C12ZIN4,"The Ghost Army is a fantastic story of World War II secrecy and deception.  A team of builders, artists and sound engineers was amassed to create what would be ""proof"" of army forces where the U.S. government and Allies wanted the Germans and Axis to believe they existed.  Using materials such as canvas, wood and tape recordings, this team (and eventually teams) would create faux tanks complete with sound effects.  The Germans were convinced.

Psychological Warfare has been going on since mankind began fighting.  (Probably Day 2.)  Making the enemy believe what isn't true to ensure what _is_ true remains secret is tricky business.  These guys (and ladies at home) pulled it off.  This is an outstanding documentary of those unsung warriors.",1468195200,4,748,5.073770491803279

If any of these men are still alive today; 70+ years later; I would kiss every one of them. Absolutely a Total Heart story of recollections.

I had no idea that I would be so totally captivated by this film. I was. If you are not; then; their is something wrong with your perceptions of bravery & sacrifice that others before us gave in the name of Freedom for All.

During the second World War, we feared we didn't have enough tanks, jeeps, etc. so to convince the German army that we were stronger than we really were, we established a ""fake"" army whose job it was to build tanks and other equipment which could be inflated, positioned where they would be seen by enemy planes, and when no longer needed, deflated, moved to a new position, and filled with air. The members of this unit were architects, artists, and skilled craftsmen, including Bill Blass, the famous clothes designer, and they also created canvas ""villages"" and many other things.

The success of these 1100 men and women is testament to their abilities to create ""visible proof"" of Allied units that did not exist.

At the end of the film, one of the soldiers says, ""There are german records that show some of the deceptions were taken hook line and sinker"".  I would have loved to see some of those German records incorporated through showing them and translating them rather than brief reference.

We hear about the horrors endured and the bravery of such groups as the 101st Airborne, Patton's army and others, but the ""Ghost Army"" is one which escaped the history books until it was declassified.

The tactics used for deception were quite good for the time. It took people who could think outside the box to make their actions believable. Their actions saved many thousands of lives and possibly helped shorten the war in Europe. Bravo to every one of these men. Their work may not have been recognized at the time during the war by the rest of the troops, but the generals were certainly grateful. As one veteran mentioned, it was worth it all if only one mother never put a star in their window because of the existence of the ""Ghost Army"".

I was pleased at the sentiment of one man who mentioned that he never thought badly of those in Luxembourg who, as he was leaving for the rear to escape possible capture by the Nazis, the citizens were taking down the American flags and putting up the Swastikas, but doing so as they had to survive. It was all about survival for the civilians of Europe at that time.

An excellent documentary and well worth your time viewing.

5684014,5,B00C12ZIN4,"Ghost Army radio operators had imitated the real operation so well by creating the illusion that the Allied troops were traveling to the faked point of the attack in Germany that the German's intelligence radio monitoring traffic which were masters of identifying the signal of individual telegrapher from the enemy's side, missed it completely which led to Allied commander Dwight Eisenhower and British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill witnessing the momentous occasion of Rhine Crossing in the early morning of March 24, 1945 with hardly any casualty.

The Ghost Army, the 1,100 men of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops who later became famous designers, painters, illustrators, sculptors and architects were told to keep their operation a secret for forty years, never launched an attacked in the war nor never took a position. They were the artists of deception who represent the genius of American creativity, who used three type of deceptions; visual, sonic and radio to con Germans, to create surprise for invasions in Germany, saving thousands of American and Allied lives.

However, after watching Band of Brothers, it's hard to see these men as the heroes they are portrayed when they spent huge portions of the war safely ensconced away from the front lines. According to the documentary, on their worst day they lost two men.

Yes the ghost army played an important role, and yes they fought, and yes they were shelled, but the documentary would have been better if it had spent more time talking about the comparative differences between their experiences and other soldiers during the European campaign.

For anyone interested in WWII still worth watching.",1404518400,,638,5.0

They did this by creating very successful deceptions using unique and highly sophisticated camouflage and sound techniques , forcing the Germans to attack where our armies weren't and to weaken their forces where our opposing forces could easily defeat them.  These brave and talented men purposely became targets by drawing enemy fire so that allied forces could attack where the Germans thought we would never attack them.  The book also gives the reader an excellent insight into the mindsets of these men, who were not warriors, but who risked a great deal to save many allied serviceman.",1404432000,,770,4.9

I do like a good historical documentary.  For me, this qualifies.  The ""ghost"" in ""ghost army"" isn't a supernatural force of that staves off Sauron's forces at the last second.  No, in this case ""ghost"" is actually what they were called and referred this group's core mission:  to convince Nazi command that there were armies where none actually were -- the ghosts that fade into the mist.

This is good for the history buff, World War II aficionado, or anyone who might be interested in how tactical deception can be a core of warfare.

Others might not be so interested in this well-written and well-produced documentary.",1404259200,,808,4.797101449275362
5684295,5,B00C12ZIN4,"This was a very well done documentary that was extremely interesting and in some places even quite humorous.  It tells how the US Army used decoy tanks, guns, airplanes, etc. with sound effects and radio transmissions to fool the Germans into thinking they were about to encounter major US forces.
The video does a great job of explaining through some excellent movie footage what was done as well as covering info on the soldiers who repeatedly pulled it off.
At the end of the video it was noted that this operation was kept secret for 40 years after WW II ended because it was so successful that the Army wanted to keep it a secret in case it had to be used again against the Russians.

This was accomplished by a unit of artists, sound engineers and radio experts that were actually quite effective in deceiving the enemy by using rubber tanks and artillery, broadcasting sound effects and sending out false radio transmissions.  It didn't single handedly win the war, but certainly did reduce Allied casualties.  Once you know the premise, though, there's just not quite enough to sustain a full-length documentary",1401667200,,641,5.144230769230769

I'm also reminded of Regan's ""Star Wars"" (SDI) ruse (not sure if it was or not) that lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

It shows the inventive unconventional ways in War not always covered in typical  accounts but they make the difference. As one man said if they could save 10,000 men or just a few men it counted by any means we had.

I became completely engrossed in it, with the facts that I had never known about this particular group that played such an important part in the battle of Normandy. It simply amazed me and made me take an interest in a military movie like I had never expected to become involved in. This movie is for anyone who is a military movie buff, or those who never thought they'd even have the least bit of an interest, like myself, but just were curious and will be more than surprised.

I particularly liked how the personnel used their talents after the war.  The 23rd shows how the USA, in one of its rare moments, utilized the talents of civilians for the war effort.  We just didn't put these exceptional men behind rifles, but we allowed them to ""think outside the box"" to help the innumerable combat arms units fight.

5684465,5,B00C12ZIN4,"This tells the story of a top secret WW2 US Army Unit whose job was to deceive the enemy into believing allied forces were located where they weren't. They were to draw the attention - and fire - away from the real allied units so the real units would have the element of surprise.

Apparently the job of this unit wasn't declassified until 1996.

I recall learning about such deceptions in the build-up to D-Day. Using various tricks the allies gave the impression the crossing would be at Pas de Calais. I thought this was the only time such deception was deployed until I saw this film.

The unit told about in this film followed the allies into France and Germany. They went all over the front line as the allies advanced into Germany. They always tried to make the Germans think large allied units were building up in places where they were not. They got shot at and some died because they were so good at what they did.

It's great to see some of the men who took part in this deception and see the tricks they utilized.

It's estimated that their deception saved 10's of thousands of lives.

It's a fairly short film. Easy to follow. No need to be a WW2 scholar/buff to enjoy this. However, if you're a WW2 buff I'm sure you'll like it.",1397520000,,1243,4.3826086956521735

5684467,5,B00C12ZIN4,"The movie detailed a fascinating  yet little known aspect of world war II. The talents and creativity of these soldiers, along with the courage it took to draw the attention of the German army to their activities was inspiring. Equally inspiring is the continuing stories of these citizen soldiers who returned from their service and made lives for themselves. While all who served should be honored,these men served in relative anonymity and deserve the attention that this movie brings.",1397520000,,488,5.177215189873418

Primarily the work of artists and clever electronic technicians, if there was ever any doubt about whether the ""creative"" types made a significant contribution to the war effort, this untold story dispels all doubt.  The 23rd Divisions' feints, dissimulations, deceptive but convincing field radio traffic, camouflage maneuvers and capacity to create credible fake armies saved many Allied lives and was widely deployed in numerous campaigns - perhaps most critically during the Battle of the Bulge.  If you think there is nothing left to say novel about the War, watch this and be surprised.",1396915200,,888,5.328571428571428

Units which, in reality, did not exist.

They used a combination of inflatable tanks and infantry pieces, along with broadcasting false orders by radio, and playing the sounds of an army unit over loudspeakers.  They did a lot of good, while often taking on the nerve shattering task of trying to draw fire themselves, directing it away from the real battle units.

Theres a lot of humor here, unusual and appreciated for a WWII doc.  But on the flip side, theres not a lot of emotion, and it can be a bit repetitive.  An interesting true story of an oddball but important group of soldiers.",1396742400,,787,4.924242424242424

5684491,3,B00C12ZIN4,"I found this documentary fascinating. Camouflage is so common now and yet the fact that the army found ways to utilize artists so effectively to create the props and the screens for protection.
 The use of sound to spread misdirection and phony armies that caused assumptions by Nazi Germany to be mislead was very revealing. It was great there were still some veterans left to interview.and what some of the men went on to become after the war was a great ending. Watch it. It's so surprising.

I have studied much about the second world war, but never anything about this unit. Their contribution to the war effort should be better reported and understood.",1396051200,,272,4.571428571428571

5684520,5,B00C12ZIN4,I enjoyed the film. The film showed how a group of men help fight the Germans even thou they were not a combat unit. They were close to the lines and they did receive fire from the germans at times.,1395964800,,198,3.975
5684521,4,B00C12ZIN4,"The narrator is Peter Coyote who is known for his grate narrator skills. Music by Matt Mariano supports this presentation and does not get in the way of the action or narration. This is a Rick Beyer film.

Unfortunately this is in sound bite formant. A little teaser form one commenter to the next and back aging, instead of letting one person at a time tell the whole tale. The information is fascinating. However the presentation style is annoying.

I am surprised and pleased at the size and diversity of the interviewees:
Gen. Wesley Clark (ret) former NATO Commander
Pvt. Ed Biow Camouflage Unit
Pvt. Ned Harris Camouflage Unit
Lt. Dick Syracuse Sonic Unit
Roy Eichhorn US Army Historian
Sgt. Victor Dowd Camouflage Unit
Cpl. Jack Masey Camouflage Unit
Cpl. Arthur Shilstone Camouflage Unit
Lt. Gil Seltzer Camouflage Unit
Pvt. Joe Spence Camouflage Unit
Sgt. Jack McGlynn Sonic Unit
Pvt. Harold Flinn Sonic Unit
Cpl. Al Albetecht Sonic Unit
Sgt. Spike Berry Radio Unit
Sgt. Stan Nance Radio Unit
Lt. Bob Conrad Radio Unit
Lt. Bernie Mason Camouflage Unit
Lt. John Jarvie Camouflage Unit
Lt. John Walker Sonic Unit
Pvt. Bill Sayles Camouflage Unit

Watch them design and blow up tanks with air compressors.
See inflatable shoulders (like the co-pilot in the movie ""Airplane"")
Hear them doing something in the bushes.
Watch as they deceive with radio with over 100 operators.
What not phony tank tracts.
Even counterfeit commanders.

Sometime this may backfire.

If you saw the movie Patton with George C. Scott they did a smaller version of this in England. What is interesting is that Patton really did use the ghost army in September 1944 near Metz.

One plus of this documentary is that they dispersed the sketches made by the artists. The other plus was finding out how many became popular artists after the war.

Hopefully this documentary will be done again without the sound bite format.",1395878400,,1899,4.915625
5684522,4,B00C12ZIN4,"Very nice documentary on European theater operations of three facets of the military that was successful at fooling the German army into thinking there were allied troops where there actually weren't any, just sound effects, rubber tanks, and fake radio transmissions.",1395878400,,268,5.560975609756097

5684597,4,B00C12ZIN4,"The more one learns about the scope of WWII activities, the more one is amazed. The Ghost Army - like the Monuments Men - remains a 'ghost' to most people. I had no idea such a unit existed, much less that they had such an important part in the war effort. A major reason is that their work was classified for so long. If you are a history fan, by all means watch this.",1393632000,,369,4.0

5684600,5,B00C12ZIN4,My Father fought in North Africa so I have been reading everything I find about that campagine but the title intrigued me and I am glad that I watched this video. Amazing the talent and work that went into desiging and building the Ghost Army.  I understand that some of this was also used in the North African Campagine.,1393545600,,321,4.440677966101695

5684602,5,B00C12ZIN4,"Surprise! I almost didn't watch as I am not a fan of ""creature"" science fiction movies. But this turns out to be a fascinating docu-drama about the most secret operation of world war two. Well made, with surviving members of the division telling their stories, it will draw you in as you hope the whole idea works. It will make you grin as well as shake your head in wonder Watch it!",1393545600,,383,4.333333333333333

Bits and pieces of this story have floated out to popular consciousness, so I confess that there was relatively little here that caught me entirely unawares. But even here there are exceptions: the disaster at Brest; saving Patton's (and the 3rd Army's) squishy bits at Metz; the soldier returning a film to the library, but being told to unharness his weapon and get out of town (the town of Bastogne). This is a fine piece of documentary story-telling. Some heroes save lives.",1393459200,,579,4.621359223300971
5684606,5,B00C12ZIN4,The art of deception in warfare. The battlefield is like a chess or poker game. Making your enemy think you are doing one thing then you fool them by doing another. Great Documentary,1393459200,,182,4.545454545454546
5684607,4,B00C12ZIN4,Great documentary on this operation that few of us were aware of.  Deception is certainly a function in defeating the enemy.,1393372800,,124,4.904761904761905
5684608,5,B00C12ZIN4,I enjoyed this documentary very much. It is based on a real event and it explains very straightforwardly some facts about World War 2 that I completely ignored. I knew that some deception had taken place but not to the extent narrated in the documentary. Great documentary.,1393372800,,273,4.829787234042553
5684609,5,B00C12ZIN4,We love history and this was an excellent film.  Have watched previous shows on the unit that the English created and didn't really realize that we had one as it was only de-classified in the late 1980's.  Excellent show.,1393372800,,221,4.641025641025641

5684618,5,B00C12ZIN4,What can I say?! I was in awe from start to finish. Such a refreshing look at a unit that hasn't had a lot of recognition. The recounts from the actual soldiers were absolutely amazing. I'm making my boyfriend watch it with me!,1393286400,,227,4.3023255813953485
5684619,4,B00C12ZIN4,Very interesting. Had never heard of this unit or what it did. Could have been longer and ending left me with lots of questions I ended up researching on the internet.,1393200000,,167,4.419354838709677

5684626,5,B00C12ZIN4,"As a Navy veteran who is the daughter of parents (both) who served in WWII, I was amazed to see and hear this story of how this group of extremely brave soldiers did what they did to completely fool the German war machine and help the U.S. win. It was absolutely incredible to see the inflatable tanks, trucks and other equipment and see what other tactics were used to accomplish their mission which was approved all the way to the top....General Eisenhower.  It was also very interesting to see all the different kinds of people who were brought into service to become members of this unique team of solders who were artists and different craftsmen who used their talents to create the illusions used to trick the Germans into thinking real units of the U. S. Army were in a specific place when the fake unit was really what they were listening to or seeing from the air.  Then, after the war, all the surviving members were sworn to secrecy...they couldn't even tell their families what they did for several decades...sort of like the British who signed the ""Official Secrets Act.""  They couldn't tell their families what they did in the war, either.  This documentary is just fascinating and definitely worth watching!",1392854400,,1222,4.75
5684627,4,B00C12ZIN4,"This is a well done story of a secret that was kept for more than 40 years and probably helped to win the war. I'm not a big war movie buff, but I like war stories, especially when they are unusual like this one.",1392854400,,212,3.840909090909091

5684633,5,B00C12ZIN4,This is a great story about WWII and the unknown and unsung heroes among many. Compelling and evidence of the complete sacrifice U.S. citizens from all walks of life gave to help defend democracy and stop tyranny. Also amazing how many people gave the full measure of their life and became famous after the war without feeling as though the government owed them anything.,1392768000,,371,4.8125

5684638,5,B00C12ZIN4,This was a very interesting story told by the people behind this secret army. The actual footage brought it to life and made it more real.

5684639,4,B00C12ZIN4,"Love the filming and narrative on everything in which this technical savvy army personnel performed during WWII.

Looking back it's hard to believe that we were able to deceive the Germans in so many areas of the war and in doing so we were able to simply help in containing the loss of our servicemen.

This was tame enough for the 11 year old to watch, except there is a portion discussing the art drawn in the brothels and the drawings show top nudity, so keep that in mind.
The information about the Ghost Army, the men who served in the unit and the tactics are all covered in a respectful way and didn't seem embellished or glorified. But it did enforce the wondrous accomplishments of the Ghost Army units.",1392508800,,557,4.41747572815534

5684643,4,B00C12ZIN4,"I enjoy historical films especially those about WW II. It was fascinating to watch this story; I had never been aware of this group of soldiers before. I had seen footage of similar actions connected to Patton's fake army before DDay, but this was a revelation--how so many men could keep a secret for decades is just amazing. I also like Peter Coyote as narrator--have listened to others he had done and am always pleased with his intonation and interest.",1392422400,,456,4.7125
5684644,4,B00C12ZIN4,"What a revelation to discover this secret  ""Army"" and the part they played in fooling the enemy army into thinking that an American army was, where they were not.  The fact that they were so real, led an American tank command to charge the enemy. thinking that balloons of the Ghost Army were real and depended on their support, which they could not give.  I suggest that anyone. who had not heard or read of the Ghost Army try this video.  The volunteers for this army knew in advance, that if they succeeded in making the Germans think that they were a real army, they might not survive the experience.",1392422400,,604,4.463636363636364

5684648,5,B00C12ZIN4,This is an excellent documentary on some of the lesser-known specialists in the second world war. It helps demontrate that Might alone is rarely enough to win the day. Creativity and intellect often are the determining factor - just ask Goliath.,1392249600,,245,5.0
5684649,5,B00C12ZIN4,"I saw the title and wondered what the movie was about. It was about the military making the Germans believe we were somewhere else.

5684655,5,B00C12ZIN4,This was a new and amazing insight into World War II for me. I had no idea that the deception efforts in the war were so organized and sophisticated. This documentary is told in a real and heartfelt style. One thing that was amazing to me (as a designer and artist myself) was the level of artistic talent that the Ghost Army possessed and brought to bear.

5684662,5,B00C12ZIN4,"This was a fascinating look inside the ""deception"" branch of the military during WWII.  The ideas brought forward were so simple, they were brilliant. It is true that you can make the enemy see exactly what they expect to see.  There was also a British counterpart; they even camouflaged the entire harbor of Alexandria to make the Germans bomb the wrong location.  Brilliant!!!",1391990400,,378,4.968253968253968

5684668,5,B00C12ZIN4,"I thought this movie would be about ghost sightings- but it's a great documentary about ""fake"" Troops & artillary the USA created in WWII by it's artistic soldiers. Just as faux stage scenery and props deceive in a Play/ movie, you'll laugh as these veterans tell humorous stories of situations that arised and how they managed to keep the secret of their fake props, fake camps and acting roles. Great film footage, examples of their artwork and the ending tells where a few of these artists careers took them. (one was a famous fashion designer) The ploy was so successful that it was kept secret for 50 years in case the USA needed to use this tactic again- and also so future enemies wouldn't use the same trick back on the U.S. A FAST moving movie you'll watch again with friends who love History trivia!",1391904000,,809,4.586206896551724

5684670,5,B00C12ZIN4,Interesting to learn about this aspect of WW2.  Most people probably would argue that this never happened since it seems to be such a secret held for such a long time.  Very enjoyable.,1391904000,,184,4.545454545454546
5684671,4,B00C12ZIN4,"What a good movie, it was so interesting to hear what this particular unit did for our servicemen.  Complex and simple trickery that saved thousands of men.

My husband is a huge war movie, documentary, book fan.  He will watch anything and everything about the wars.  This was one of the first movies that we watched together that he hadn't seen nor had heard from.

Very well done, acting was exceptional, nothing left hanging!  Well recommended!",1391817600,,448,4.828947368421052

WWII to them is like the Spanish American War to some of we old timers.  Just too far back in history.

5684695,5,B00C12ZIN4,I often wonder why we are just learning about the great courage and dedication of these soldiers more than 60 years after their exploits.  The job these men did was incredible.  They should have been decorated for what they achieved.  The ability to fool the German Army of the 1940s was pretty outstanding.  I glad to know that people like this are on our side.  Good work gentlemen.,1391299200,,384,4.588235294117647

I decided on this documentary as I thought I wouldn't really need to give it my undivided attention.  Well I was so wrong!  Shortly after it started I called my 18yr old son in and told him, ""this is AMAZING you've got to see this"".  We both stopped what we were doing at sat down to watch it together.  So very interesting and I'm glad my son became a little more exposed to our great history!",1391299200,,530,4.25

5684712,4,B00C12ZIN4,"This documentary was extremely interesting.  I don't usually go in for war related movies or documentaries, but this was different.  I thought it was very well done.  The interviews with actual members of the unit added such detail and emotion to the story, and to see some of the art work/sketches that they created during their rest periods was amazing.

The techniques and props employed, created under adverse, war time conditions, were ingenious and were used to great effect, aiding the defeat of the Germans. Many of the artists are still alive and were interviewed for this documentary that includes extensive war time footage. A nice illustration of the maxim, all is fair in love and war.",1390953600,,568,4.855670103092783

It was amazing how this talented group of creative artist got together to fool the Nazis on so many fronts.

5684724,3,B00C12ZIN4,"This was an interesting movie about a terrible time in history. I am fairly familiar with most aspects of the Second World War, but this was new to me. What I found fascinating was the effectiveness of a fairly few very brave soldiers in influencing several of the German units they faced. The idea of using stealth and misdirection to achieve combat goals in the middle of one of the biggest and deadliest theaters in WWII was desperate and inspired. I found it ironically pertinent , given the latest episodes concerning national security and secrets, to view this retrospective. The film certainly raised questions for me regarding the tradeoff between our security and our privacy.",1390867200,,685,4.965217391304348

Kept secret for 49+ years, the deceptive practices of a 1000+ military unit, complete with blow up tanks and pre-recorded battle movements and false radio banter, will still entertain the viewer who wishes to extend his knowledge of this terrible scourge known as The War To End All Wars.",1390867200,,565,4.775510204081633

The documentary about the Ghost Army opened my eyes to the use of art and theater by the Allies.  The Ghost Army was useful in making the Allies WWII enemies think troops were deployed where they weren't, think tanks were massing for invasion, and think imaginary airfields existed.

An entire group in the army whose only weapon was deception.  They were an interesting mix of men and skills.  Very creative types who used military equipment fakes, broadcast recordings of men and equipment, and bogus radio transmissions to fool the enemy.  If you have any interest in WW2 history this is a must.

The streaming quality was first rate also.",1389830400,,528,4.612903225806452

This was put together in such a way as to both inform and educate but also amuse.  With such a dark subject it is difficult to find humor but, I could imagine the look on the enemy's face when they pulled up  to a patch of ground to find that they had just used up days worth of munitions on nothing but space.  Very well put together.",1389657600,,483,4.042105263157895

To my surprise and delight this was the most moving documentary of the 2nd WW that I have ever seen.  It had humor and realism that was very moving.

The fact that there was video of actual events and shots of individuals in their youth and then interviews with the same person in the present was very moving.

I will watch this again!",1389657600,,473,4.211111111111111

5684829,2,B00C12ZIN4,This documentary had about 15 minutes worth of somewhat interesting material crammed into an hour or so (I didn't make it to the end) of feature length. At least 1/3 of the coverage was about the fact that these deception specialists were mostly artists and they spent much of their idle time (apparently considerable) sketching whatever was in front of them. We were treated to viewing each and every one of these sketches repeatedly. Wow! That makes for a real nail-biter.,1389657600,,474,4.864197530864198

It is humbling to see these folks come bravely and creatively together to accomplish one of the most astonishing war tactics in history.  It's a truly worthwhile, ""safe"" movie for even young children.  It is not gory or scary, but inspirational to see the talents and creativity of our armed forces.

The Ghost Army tells the story of a section of the army in WWII reserved for artists and resourceful people who's whole goal was to deceive the enemy into believing that they were actually someone else, and there were more of them than there really were.

It worked so well that all involved were sworn to absolute secrecy until only a few years ago. Ingenious how they used primitive technology effectively. The division was given credit for the success of several major battles. Recommended.",1389398400,,471,5.293333333333333

The video footage is good quality and the men who served tell the stories of their own contributions to the unit as well as how their participation shaped their lives.

5684871,4,B00C12ZIN4,This was very interesting.  I've always been a bit of a history buff but was unaware of this group.  The U.S. had troops who were moved into key locations to convince the German's that there were more troops in a position than was true.  This was done both to draw attention away from where major offensives were actually going to happen and to help defend weak areas in U.S. lines.  The lengths these guys went to pull off their ruses was brave and impressive.  The fact that many of them were artists means that there are many drawings / sketches the men did in downtime that gave it a more personal feel.,1389225600,,607,4.383928571428571

Very informative and interesting as well as entertaining. I especially enjoyed seeing the various drawing and sketches done by many of the artist's.

The workers (mostly women)  who made the inflatable equipment at the US Rubber plant in Woonsocket were told that they were making equipment for target practice.  They were paid 49 cents an hour.

Not that I am naive enough to believe that destruction was not the resounding unstoppable theme in everyone's mind that touched down in Europe during this war, but of course to every exceedingly evil side of everything, there is at least a glimpse of humanity in it its goodness. This film captures it in the most unheard of ways, in the most unthinkable scenes, and really paints a poignant view of the theater of the second world war from a point of view that one is allowed to smile and sometimes even laugh at. Not to mention the irony of the danger and importance that the Ghost Army played in relation to the gags they all felt they were playing. Just a really fun film.

5684914,5,B00C12ZIN4,"This documentary is about  1100 American soldiers  who were trained artists - highly inventive in their creation of fake tanks, weapons and in creating the sounds of large numbers of troops. Their job was to impersonate tens of thousands of troops to keep the  Axis soldiers at bay until larger (and armed) forces could arrive on the scene. They were often very effective at this even though sometimes they drew  enemy fire.
Decades later the interviews with the veterans from this group show a certain mischievousness and enjoyment in recalling the often zany ruses they came up with. Their recollections often show hints of the playful and very creative young men they once had been, and successful creative professions they lived after the war.",1389052800,,747,5.0

Their mission was kept secret for nearly 50 years after the war's end. The US did not wish to acknowledge to the Warsaw Pact how military deception had been used against Germany. Archival film footage, still photographs, and paintings and  sketches created by soldiers are presented , This PBS program shows extraordinary battlefield illusions, the talented young men, and how the illusions were constructed so as to deceive air reconnaissance efforts.

I had heard of the deception the Allied forces used to convince the Germans that the invasion of Europe would be at the Port du Calais, but I didn't realize that these tactics were used extensively throughout the ground war in France, Luxemburg, and Germany.

5685005,4,B00C12ZIN4,"What a strange twist from most of the front-line war movies depicting WTSHTF action.  This is about a crew of artists with different strengths who form together to use deception as a very powerful mechanism to aid those soldiers  who actually were under front line fire.  While they never fought in that sense, this unit was always in danger and in harm's way, but in a manner you might not expect.  Definitely different from what you might expect from a war movie. Pay attention to the name ""Bill Blass"",  I was surprised and learned much from this documentary.",1388534400,,562,4.6938775510204085

Great to know how much they actually did fool the Germans.  Not sure why some of the other reviews made comments about not believing that - it was pretty clear from captured soldiers who actually documented where they thought there were troops and a several other events that laid it out.

I assumed they were used in other ways, but I didn't know how many battle relied on their effectiveness.

These men created entire divisions, seemingly ready to attack at daybreak, out of inflatable tanks, jeeps, and weapons. Using visual and audio 'tricks' , the Ghost Army proved to be exceptional decoys, allowing combat troops to attack from an entirely different angle.

5685084,5,B00C12ZIN4,"I've watched a few dozen documentaries on WWII in my nearly 40 years of watching them, and can say this
one was fascinating, revealing and poignant.  As a writer/artist, I can relate to these soldiers and their unsatiated
creative appetite.  This film tells the riveting story where the US Military thought ""out of the box"" solutions drawing from
Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" where one chapter details finding your enemies ""Weak and Strengths, then using Illusion and Reality
to test for their Vacuity and Substance.

A must watch military film for historical context, with perhaps even relevance within today's electronic form of deception/illusion based strategies of our own NSA.",1387756800,,676,5.18348623853211

5685091,5,B00C12ZIN4,"I grew up with my father giving us kids only sketchy and mysterious information about his time in the U.S. Army during WWII.  As was typical of our generation with dads who had been GIs, we traded our fathers' war stories and, of course, everyone wanted their own dad to have the most grand, heroic tale so that we could boast about it with our friends and classmates.  His stories were strange, though, and rather unsatisfyingly technical - such as, the time he and his platoon set up a fake bivouac in the woods and the Luftwaffe actually bombed and strafed it, and how they would repeatedly march through liberated French villages, change their shoulder patches when they reached the woods on the other side, and then march back through the same town again (to inflate the troop strength being reported to the Germans by spies), etc...  Rather hard to explain and not the kind of stuff a kid can put up against the gripping tales of other kids' dads having tossed grenades into machine gun nests, being wounded and pinned-down while on forward reconnaissance missions, or single-handedly capturing almost a whole enemy division (there was, naturally, quite a bit of exaggeration)!

But now, with ""The Ghost Army"" it all comes together - things that veterans of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, such as my Father, could not reveal because they were ordered at the end of the war to keep them secret:  the amazing sonic and radio deception operations that, combined with the rubber tanks, spoof unit insignia and fake division headquarters, created an integrated system of battlefield deception used effectively to fool the enemy, gain tactical advantage, and save lives.

It may have come too late to get me any props with my (former) classmates, but it's very satisfying to finally know the whole story!",1387670400,188,1811,4.8827361563517915

It was really exciting to see something new to me.
Also on a more generic note it is well done!",1387670400,,460,4.3604651162790695

5685096,5,B00C12ZIN4,I stumbled on this documentary and was completely swept away by the tale and it's persuasive presentation.  Deception operations are nothing new in the art of war and rarely receive credit when effective.  It is good to see this belated retrospective on a special WII unit comprised of artists and creative oddballs that operated from Normandy to the Rhine with inflatable tanks and sound trucks.  Unstated during the documentary but resonating in light of recent controversy over the issue of homosexuality in the military was how effective the Army used these artists and fashion designers to integrate their talents into the war effort in 1944.  Bill Blass was one of the units camouflage and deception artists.  Glad the units' mission was declassified and this story is told.,1387584000,,780,5.110236220472441

5685107,5,B00C12ZIN4,"The Ghost Army is a PBS-produced documentary on a fascinating and up-to-now unknown mission in World War II--a unit of American GIs in Europe was given the task of deceiving the Nazi German army as to where the actual American troops were going to be fighting.  This unit, using props such as inflatable rubber tanks, sound trucks and illusions and camouflage created by artists recruited from art schools around the country, was able to create the illusion of war in order to save lives and help the Allies safely advance.  Absolute amazing and historically accurate, this unit's work had been kept a secret for almost 50 years after the end of the war!  PBS broadcast this documentary in 2012.

It was compiled from file footage that had to be dug out from multiple places, and this is the true, but almost unbelieveable story of how these clever men fooled our enemies and changed the course of World War II.  You cannot believe your eyes, as you see the fake tanks, the aircraft, and the clever tricks used to make the faux army seem real.  It was dangerous and exposed them to enemy attack, but these brave men escaped mostly unharmed.  The interviews of the actual men who did all this made it even better.  What an incredible story!

Combined with other forms of great faux tech, this documentary shows from inception to implementation how a small group of unusual soldiers/artists pulled it off. I swear every time I see those inflatable tanks, I laugh and laugh. It's just so funny! They thought outside the box, and using their talents repeatedly created a ruse mimicking the sights, sounds, and radio talk of a vast army. Even to this day, it's just so impressive.
