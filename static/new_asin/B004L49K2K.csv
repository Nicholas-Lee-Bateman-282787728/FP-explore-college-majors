4400233,5,B004L49K2K,"As a yoga teacher of the 50+ crowd and of those with physical limitations of all ages, I'm always looking for videos that serve my clients. This DVD brings the full experience of yoga to all levels of practitioners and I highly recommend it.

If you feel you are to 'inflexible' for yoga, try this DVD to get you started. With routines for the chair, floor and supported, you will find something here just right for you.

Thanks JJ for another great yoga DVD!",1304035200,31,459,4.4523809523809526
4400234,5,B004L49K2K,"I ordered this to see if I could actually do yoga.  I tried a few times, but it was always too difficult, but the description seemed to be what I was looking for.  And so far it is just what I wanted.

It is set up with three levels, Very Gentle (some workouts is solely sitting on a chair to start), Gentle and Gentle Challenge.  And I can actually work with the Very Gentle.  The movements are geared to make it nice and easy and I have been happy with how I feel.  There are some more challenging items in the next sections from what I have seen, but even then there seems to be a nice bring along with what you can do.

If you have been looking for any type of Gentle Yoga, this one is it.  The 5 or so routines in the Very Gentle, which is what I have been using now every other day for a couple of weeks, makes this worthwhile.

Very pretty setting along the water is nice and relaxing.",1302566400,64,892,3.994350282485876

I found actual choices of routines (12) after being 'out' for months.  I started with chair exercises and am moving toward the more advanced routines as the weeks go by.  I would've  started while I was ill had I known how easy these routines could be.  Calming music, mostly well cued with video to match.

The  bonus feature by the Dali Lama is a great addition.  I liked this video so much I purchased 5 copies to give as gifts. The price is great also.

This is the perfect DVD.  There are three levels of exercises from very gentle, gentle and gentle challenging.  I have tried all the levels and all are very doable for me.  The yoga uses a mat and chair.  The instructions are very clear, and there are pauses between moves in order for you to get in position.

4400250,2,B004L49K2K,"Having a choice of different yoga ""workout levels"" on this DVD is good. However, they are way too easy and boring.

Had the DVD summary mentioned that, I would have purchased something else instead because I feel this was a  waste of my money.",1383436800,,318,4.678571428571429
4400251,5,B004L49K2K,I began with the relaxation section to get me warmed up and into the idea of doing yoga. There are many great starting off points for those who have limited mobility like myself and can't get out of bed or a chair. Both of these issues are addressed in this video. I have already recommended it to all of my freinds in my weight loss group and can't wait to know the relaxation technique without the video so I can move onto the next phases adding the relaxation at the end of all of the yoga exercises!,1383091200,,503,4.195876288659794

4400255,5,B004L49K2K,"I used this DVD for several months and am revisiting the page to buy another disc, to replace the original lost during a move. It's a great introduction to yoga for stress reduction and gentle improvement of flexibility. I'm sure many will find it slow and boring, but for someone who is starting out really out of shape (like I was) and looking for stress reduction as well as improved flexibility, it was a great place to start. I find the actor's voice low and soothing. Yes, lots of footage is re-used as the different routines are edited together. Didn't bother me a bit, in fact I found it easier to follow the more challenging routines because of the familiar scenes. Yes, it is very slow and many of the poses use chairs, and/or involve little movement. You are not going to get a cardio workout with this DVD but for what I wanted it was perfect.

I bought 2 other Gentle/Beginner titles when I first set out to try yoga and this is the one I'd recommend.",1370822400,5,964,4.415730337078652

GENTLE YOGA is divided into several parts, and depending on your body, you will find a perfect yoga workout with clear instuctions.  Personally, since I have been taking yoga classes at our local senior center for two years, I found this DVD too easy (and those classes have been geared to older, stiffer bodies). Instead, I will pass this along to my 42 year old daughter who wants to begin practicing.",1368230400,2,579,4.611650485436893

4400263,5,B004L49K2K,I work for a senior independednt comminuty and they really wanted to do yoga. I found trhis video and have been getting rave reviews. Its easy to follow and not difficult for them to do. It was very gentle.,1352160000,3,206,4.3076923076923075
4400264,4,B004L49K2K,"I just received the dvd and have begun working through it. The inclusion of the talk by HH The Dalai Lama is a welcome addition and goes a long way into helping connect the physical poses of the dvd with a more full lifestyle. The best definition for yoga, in my view, is ""unity,"" and as such, full yoga practice needs to go beyond the physical. Emotional, intellectual and spiritual aspects are real parts of life, and the unifying of these with the body is my goal with yoga. While the dvd did not really get into how the physical practices might serve to bind the whole being together, the Dalai Lama's discussion of compassion and being serves as a very worthy reminder and hint at what might be gained.
So far, I have found the routines easy to follow, but a little bit rushed at times. I have realized that my broad chest means that I am still inhaling while the video instruction has gotten half way through the ex-hale. Adjusting to this is not really difficult fortunately as once I view it, I can practice easily at my own pace. I am also noting that the video does a good job at reminding the viewer to proceed at the appropriate personal pace. I cannot quite stretch and twist my arms as well as the instructor, while my waist movements seem to go even further than the instructor. Given this, it is easy for me to see that where I need work and am able to work with the video to find ways to get my waist to assist my arms.
I would like to know more about coupling Bhakti, or devotional yoga with that Hatha yoga of the video, but realize that this is not the intent of the video here. What is promised is delivered. I have found that Crowley's Eight Lectures on Yoga (yes, Aleister Crowley. He was not quite as beastly in my view as he is usually portrayed), which is easily available for free on the net, serves to cover a lot of the philosophical and historical ground, which I consider important, and then coupled with the the physcical moves and Dalai Lama's words on the dvd, I have a pretty full program. I should not forget to recommend attention to the diet when working on one's lifestyle of course. That might be a very personal matter, certainly, but I would really think that it is very important to keep in mind when practicing yoga of any sort.
I should note that I am not really a beginner to yoga, but am trying to return to practice, so it is possible that I have something of an advantage here. In short, the dvd does not provide the whole picture, but does what it promises. Other supplemental research is most likely a good idea for any student, but what is appropriate is bound to be a matter of personal preference. I am sure there are not many others out there, for example, who are going to find running to Aleister Crowley much help, lol.",1349481600,2,2777,4.3526011560693645
4400265,4,B004L49K2K,"Excellent modified routines, from very gentle to gentle challenge. Very gentle chair series is especially beneficial for people who are not ready for floor work; wonderful relaxation techniques and internal visualizations.
The only drawback is that it's necessary to pause in order to transition from floor to chair,
there's no set transition, and the floor poses begin immediately after a brief abstract interlude. The instructor is lovely, healthy
without being intimidating and the dvd has a
 pleasant tone that is neither new-agey nor yoga-preachy. It's a real workout, subtle, relaxing & rejuvenating.",1346803200,22,606,5.586956521739131
4400266,5,B004L49K2K,"Gentle Yoga, like the name implies, is a video that is good if you are new to yoga or are looking for less strenuous yoga exercises.  It is not that all the workouts are easy, it is that it is sectioned well.  There are three sections of various degrees of workouts.  The basic level is the easiest and done on a chair.  With the 5 workouts, there is alot to work with.  The levels progress, but all of the are geared nicely for the word ""Gentle"" in mind.  There is alot to work with and makes it a great DVD if you are looking for this type of practice video.",1327795200,8,560,4.045454545454546

The Very Gentle is just that.  There's no pressure if you can't do a move. I try to do some everyday.  It really makes a difference in how I am able to move that day.",1324080000,18,338,3.732394366197183

4400270,5,B004L49K2K,"I've been struggling with a hip injury for the last three months.  Even weekly chiropractor appointments hadn't taken care of the problem completely and I was starting to feel pretty desperate.  I had a friend recommend I start doing yoga, so I looked into something very, very basic and gentle to start with.  I ordered this and one other DVD, but this one is, by far, the superior one.  The routines are just gentle enough for me to get through every morning without hurting myself too much, but still give me a good work-out to loosen up all my joints.  While I'm still not 100% pain free, I am noticing pretty big differences after only 4 days of doing the very gentle floor routines.  I also notice that I'm gaining strength in my back and hips to actually do the moves properly.  This DVD is definitely worth ordering!",1315267200,31,824,4.527027027027027
4400271,5,B004L49K2K,"I have a bad shoulder/arm due to injury, as well as some more generalized joint problems, so was looking for something gentle that would allow me to safely improve my flexibility. This DVD fits the bill.

It's broken down into three difficulty levels -- Very Gentle, Gentle, and Gentle Challenge. Within each of those levels are a variety of different routines that you can choose from, depending on your needs and abilities. I am still only on the Very Gentle level, but have found a routine that works very well for me. I'm not yet able to do all of the exercises in that routine, but am improving each day.

The instructor explains and demonstrates the poses very well, and she's very clear about not having to push yourself if a pose proves too challenging. This allows for a comfortable pace tailored to your specific needs. It also feels great to see progress -- something I couldn't quite do one day, I can do a bit better the next, and better still the next.

The setting is calm and relaxing, and it's very easy to keep up with and follow the routines. I'd thought that yoga wasn't something I would be able to do at all, but this DVD has proven me wrong.

For people who are super fit and flexible, this DVD is probably way too beginner-ish. But if you have any kind of physical or mobility issues, or just lack flexibility, give this a try. The different routines take various approaches that ensure there will be something for everybody -- for me, the routine sitting in a chair works best, but for others the lying down routine might fit the bill, for example.

Very pleased with this so far and would recommend it to anyone who thinks yoga is out of their reach.",1312934400,127,1676,4.481967213114754

8433790,2,B004L49K2K,"Be careful with this product! I've been doing different styles of yoga for 15 years. My husband wanted to try doing yoga to increase his flexibility and avoid injury from his endurance training. We did this program together via streaming on Amazon Prime.

The first problem is that if you're doing this via streaming the sequences are completely out of order and there's no way to change that! This could be a serious problem for beginners or anyone with injuries as the disjointed flow has you doing lower back bends and inverted poses (downward dog) before you have sufficiently warmed up. That could result in major problems, pain, or even injury! Please be careful!

The problem I have with the program itself (assuming the sequences are in the proper order if you watch via DVD) is that there was little explanation or modifications given. Most of the poses were shown in silence and from only one camera angle. If you don't know yoga or how the pose is supposed to work, this could be quite frustrating and again be an issue where someone could get injured from improper technique or modifications.",1437609600,,1104,4.774869109947644

8433793,4,B004L49K2K,"I'm brand new to yoga. I'm working on getting healthier by fixing my health problems which have been caused by a very poor immune system all of my life. I am not thin at all, and definitely not flexible enough for standard yoga, nor healthy enough for that as well.

I found this DVD by doing a lot of searching on Amazon and Google. I saw that it was specifically geared toward those who were not as flexible, not as fit, etc, so I decided to buy it. I am glad I did.

Honestly, the first time I watched some of the DVD I chose the first (top left?) video from the most gentle section. I was laughing inside, because I was ignorant of the fact that just exercising your eye muscles and rolling your shoulders and remembering to breathe and focus on the breath was very helpful. Though it hurts my eyes to do that, so I don't, but it is a great introduction to Yoga.

I put the DVD away for a few months since it just didn't seem like somethign I could get into. I had bought a yoga mat, 2 blocks (as a set) and a cotton strap at the same time as the DVD so I had what I needed to start.

I just started using the DVD about a week ago. I decided to start with the Gentle Routine (middle section) and the Hips video which is the left column, middle title. I have been malnourished due to severe health issues with not being able to eat unless I have an awful reaction to the food, and have a lot of numbness over most of my body, and have definite weakness due to lack of proper nutrition (maybe B vitamins or Zinc, something...) and could barely stand up out of bed, or the couch or worse, the toilet. My legs were weak enough for me to require being in a wheelchair OR non-stop use of a walker... Knees giving out when walking or standing, etc.

After that first morning doing the full routine I felt so much better over all but was still weak, and could barely get off the floor. The only way I still can get off the floor is to put my right knee on one of my blocks, left knee on the other, hands on a chair or couch and then fight to get up.

The next morning I woke up and noticed that my legs were stronger! It was actually a significant strength increase! So I've been doing some form of leg exercises every day (minus one day this week). Either 30 minutes of yoga (that Hips routine) or 10 minutes of stationary recumbent bike. Both have great benefits for me, though i feel much better overall when I do the Yoga.

I am no longer falling when I try to get up but can't due to lack of strength and stability. I no longer fall when simply trying to sit down on the couch (where i sit halfway then fall due to lack of strength). My knees are much less likely to buckle for no apparent reason.

My core is strengthening, I am starting to gain a little bit of feeling back in my abdomen and legs. I am so very happy to have purchased this DVD! I am now ready to continue doing Yoga every day! I am now hooked!

Cons:
Scenes in the individual videos seem disjointed, the video freezes in between scenes
The Title Menu takes longer than normal to load and be usable, it seems to have been made using low quality materials and procedures

Pros:
JJ Etchells has a very calming voice
The routines are doable (for the most part) for me right now, and I will be able to do the others soon I'm sure
This has helped me tremendously in only a week!
Not super expensive to buy.

I highly recommend this DVD for those who are interested in starting Yoga but have physical challenges preventing them from starting at a more ""typical"" pace or set of routines. My mom was even able to do the same routine I do (the Gentle section, on floor and seated version for Hips) on the floor on my yoga mat even though she is has a severely degenerated spine due to multiple forms of arthritis (osteo and rheumatoid) and likely has osteoporosis. She did much better than I ever expected and completed the entire routine! I was very happy to see that. So this is even doable for my mom with her severely degenerated spine. Heck yeah!",1418688000,7,4011,4.175937904269081
