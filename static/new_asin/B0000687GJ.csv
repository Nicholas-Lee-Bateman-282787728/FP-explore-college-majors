7964043,4,B0000687GJ,"This is one of my favorite documentaries.  I watched it a few years ago on PBS and enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy it.  It's wonderful to see the variety of species and sheer number of animals that inhabit South Georgia Island, and of course, the cinematography and narration are excellent.  I just wish it were available in HD rather than only SD.",1378512000,,357,4.378787878787879
7964044,5,B0000687GJ,"Antarctic wildlife struggles for survival on brutal shores.  Mountains rise out of the southern ocean and endure endless storms.  Numerous glaciers cover most of the island, and ice floats in the freezing bays.  Other than scant grasses and lichens, few plants and no trees can survive in the hostile environment.  South Georgia Island is so wild and extreme that no humans have ever lived here long term even though it has fresh water and an abundant food source. Excellent cinematography and narration.  --Roger Weston, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Catch/dp/B004YTI1UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Catch</a>",1372723200,,685,6.483516483516484

7964046,4,B0000687GJ,This movie is about the island South Georgia.  Very diversified in its animals and info.  Good film.,1205712000,2,100,4.823529411764706
7964047,4,B0000687GJ,"This is a fine documentary about the animal life of the sub-Antarctic Island of South Georgia.
You see elephant seals, fur seals, at least two species of penguin and Wandering Albatross. The vast numbers of each of the species featured is impressive by themselves. Of course, you get interesting info on all these species. The male elephant seals fighting for the right to a harem until they are a bloody mess while disinterested penguins look on is particularly memorable.
Unfortunately, this is only 35 minutes long. As good as this documentary is, it could have been much better with additional analyses and commentary. The cost of a DVD will be too high for many to justify this short piece. However, this is a solid nature documentary and well worth watching. I certainly recommend it for libraries, etc., where frequent watching will justify the cost.",1068336000,24,857,4.958333333333333
