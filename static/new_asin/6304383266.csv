7869234,4,6304383266,"Love George Sanders, bought this as part of a purchase to obtain all the movies in ""The Saint"" series. Simple plot, entertaining characters - reminds me of ""The Lone Ranger"" or ""Superman,"" something you would have watched as a kid at a Saturday matinee at the local ""bijou.""  VHS tape quality is pretty good.",1367798400,,308,4.703703703703703
