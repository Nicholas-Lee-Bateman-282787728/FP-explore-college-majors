8582142,5,B00CIOR5R2,This movie handles a heart wrenching story with honestly and humanity. A powerful film about terminal illness in the context of a relationship. Actor Kim Myung-min lost weight from 72 kg to 52 kg and had to be hospitalized in his dedication to playing this role. This film is natural rather than melodramatic and the journey both characters go on feels very real.,1509494400,,363,4.777777777777778
