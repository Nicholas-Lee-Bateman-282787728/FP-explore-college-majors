At the time that I bought this, I couldn't find any reviews (Warning sign!) so I took a chance and bought it for cheaper at Wal-Mart. I was shocked at how poor the quality was. At first I thought it was a bootleg filmed by someone in the audience, but then the on-stage footage and editing showed there were more cameras.

The sound may be taken ""off the board"", as the mix is way off at the beginning and eventually the mix comes together. To explain what I mean... you can't hear bass guitar at all until later on in the concert; often when someone is singing or soloing you can't hear them until the person working the mixer raises their level... it's annoying how often this happens; there's a loud feedback that keeps returning, sometimes during songs and sometimes in between songs, and the sound man is never able to find where it's coming from; sometimes an instrument suddenly gets loud in the mix for no apparent reason... the piano, the rhythm guitar, etc. all had moments of suddenly being louder than almost anything else.

As for the performance itself, you can tell the Blues Brothers act was very new and inexperienced in front of a live audience. Neither Belushi nor Akroyd can work a crowd yet and the singing is just okay at best. The band is quite good (but the mix is not) but you can tell they haven't played together long enough to be able to ""read each other"" yet. There are moments where they're caught off guard by the singers, as well as a few sour spots musically... like the closing ""Can't Turn You Loose"" where Paul Shaeffer's organ isn't even in the same key as the rest of the band.

It occurred to me while watching this that members of this band had played and recorded with the original Stax and R&B artists, whose songs are being covered by the Blues Brothers. After performing songs like ""Soul Man"" with Sam & Dave and hearing those great vocalists, it must somehow hurt to hear ""Jake & Elwood""'s version. It's both bitter sweet and ironic that the Blues Brothers outsold those original artists and went on to have the best selling Blues records to date. Still, it's great that there was a Blues Brothers act and that they used the original players, since they were very important and responsible for bringing about a blues ""revival"" during in the late 70's and early 80's.

It's neat to see footage of the band in it's rawest stage of infancy, but I feel ""ripped off"" because this is not a properly filmed nor produced DVD. I doubt this footage was ever meant to be sold to the public, as it does not represent them well and the product is sub par, even for 1978 standards of concert film and sound. It appears to be German made, and probably off a videotape because the DVD ends abruptly, as if the film just ran out.

8518452,5,B007JPG6L6,"Released in 1980, The Blues Brothers is a comedy/farce/musical starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as brothers who get their rhythm and blues band back together in order to raise $5000 to save the orphanage where they grew up. Carrie Fisher is on hand, as well as a lot of old musicians, like James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.

I found myself laughing throughout this movie, sometimes uproariously. The best parts are the Catholic orphanage scene, the black church sequence, the diner scene, the country bar episode and any part with Carrie Fisher trying to utterly annihilate Jake (Belushi) and anyone who just happens to be in his general vicinity.

For me, though, the films a little bit overlong and shouldve been cut by about 15 minutes. For instance, they couldve easily cut the music store scene since its not as good as the other musical sequences, but then Ray Charles wouldve been cut. Nevertheless, this is a great comedy.

The film runs 133 minutes (extended cut 148 minutes) and was shot in the Chicago area.
