8170228,5,B000MMLPIC,"I strongly suggest that if you want to buy this anim then buy the DVDs published by ADV Films as they have a great feature called ""ADV Notes"" which can be turned on (and off) in the Set Up section of the menu. These notes pop up on screen and explain the pop culture references and are essential to fully understand and enjoy PaniPoni Dash.",1400630400,,340,4.246153846153846
8170229,4,B000MMLPIC,"Rebecca has started her new job teaching high school. She's an 11 year old genius. This makes it hard for her to relate to her students, whom all have major personality quirks. Their day to day life is filled with dopiness and insanity.

This show is like Azumanga Daioh on crack. The best things about this anime are the animation and comedy. It's extremely strange, so don't try to understand it. Just get past the first 5 episodes and enjoy all of the goofiness that comes. If you can get a close up picture of the cover; then you can get a get a good idea of how Paniponi is drawn. The color shading and character designs are very unique and cool. There are also some pretty good voice talents in this one. It's not one of the better animes I've seen, but it's definitely funny and good mindless entertainment.",1354838400,2,814,4.426666666666667
