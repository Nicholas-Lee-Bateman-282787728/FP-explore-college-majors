440976,5,630223168X,"""The Addams Family"" is a great treat to watch on video. The family famous is back with all it's glory on these videos. This is one of the few ways to see the show these days since TV Land dropped it in 1998. Though it was taped in SLP form, there wasn't much difference, partly because SP and SLP/EP modes record mostly in the same condition if it's in B&W. Now, for the episodes them selves:
""The Addams Family Tree""
Pugsley and Wednesday insulted at a neighbors party for their strangness, and according to the neighbors, 'they have no class'. The Addams quickly get a geniologist to find out their history, and find out some interesting things about themselves and their neighbor. Grandmama (BLOSSOM ROCK) does not appear in this episode, which is quite strange, since she probably knows the most about their history.
""Gomez, The Polotician""
Election fever grips the household. Gomez backs a man who is for the draining of swamps. The Addams are famous for backing many losers during campaigns (""Lincoln backed for our help. But we went for old Douglas!"" says Gomez). The Addams go to extremes, and Uncle Fester even makes himself lightup. In the end, their canidate joins the traditions of Dewy, Douglas, and others, and becomes a loser.
All in all, these were great episodes!",1008720000,5,1280,4.77027027027027
440977,3,630223168X,"This episode is very rare and difficult to come by. I put a lot of effort into it because of the title. I was expecting - Beatnik - maybe a poetry writing black turtleneck wearing artist. What fun that would have been. Instead you get this motorcycle guy traveling the country who just happens to break down near the Addams Family home (almost ala Easy Rider but not nearly as cool). I am sorry to say I was hugely dissapointed with this episode. Art was a better episode. Even as a huge fan/collector, I would have to recommend not going thru a lot of trouble to get a copy of this episode. If you want an alternative suggestion - try Wednesday Leaves Home/ Green Eyed Gomez. That is absolutely the best one, in my opinion.",971913600,3,724,4.37037037037037
440978,5,630223168X,This was a great treat. Morticia Joins the Ladies League is more primarily about Morticia and just great fun. Fester's Puntured Romance is pretty funny too. Especially if you are a Fester fan and want an episode that goes further into his character. A great addition to any VHS or Addams Family collection.,971913600,3,306,4.7924528301886795
440979,4,630223168X,"The cousin It comes to visit episode is a little on the slow side. But, The Addams Family goes to Court is HILARIOUS. That episode makes it worth the purchase. Gomez in court is very funny. Likened to Addams Family Values when Gomez goes to the Police Station to report that his brother owns... A BUICK!  As a huge Addams Family fan, I highly recommend this video as a great addition to any VHS collection.",971913600,4,406,4.413333333333333
440980,4,630223168X,"These two shows were both pretty good, though not my favorites.  I enjoyed the return of Mr. Hilliard, the emergence of Kitty Kat (their pet lion), and the way the Addams family terrified one or two people who rather  deserved it.  Some good parts: Wednesday and Pugsley's scuffle with an  obnoxious boy (in which they get the better of him); Morticia and Gomez's  swordplay; the feeding of the piranhas; and Morticia's beloved plants  strangling each other.  I also loved it when Gomez told Morticia not to  worry that Hilliard would drain the swamps -- all politicians do exactly  the opposite of their campaign promises!
The old Addams family show  doesn't have the gloss and style of the movies and cartoons, but it's  charming and funny.  The laugh track, though, is unnecessary and too loud.",962064000,4,797,4.865671641791045
440981,4,630223168X,"These two TV shows were livelier and funnier than the previous ones I've bought; perhaps the series got better over time.  I expected the show about a gorilla visiting the family (""Morticia Joins the Ladies'  League"") to be pretty hokey, but it was funny.  ""Fester's  Punctured Romance"" was great too. I love it when different characters  (Addams and non-Addams) have a conversation in which they both completely  misunderstand each other.  It's the kind of running joke just gets funnier  as it continues and snowballs.",962064000,4,520,5.107142857142857

441155,4,630223168X,I don't remember this show it originally aired.  I was 4or 5 years old.  I did have an Addams Family coloring book.  I started watching this i thin when WTBS started showing it in the '80s.  It is truely a classic and became one of my two all time favorite t.v. shows along with Get Smart.  Theres not a single show in this entire series that didn't make me laugh.  This is three dvds with the first 22 shows.  Starting with The Addams Family Goes To School.  When the kids are kept home from school because Because Gomez and Morticia don't like the way Witches and such arepictured in fairy tales.  This is excellent.,1472515200,,618,4.350877192982456

I watched the whole series then went and watched it again and laughed even more! You can't catch everything just watching it once.

You can watch this with kids, teenagers, moms dads, grandparents, etc. No cursing, no sex, just a really funny series that everyone will find funny.

441507,5,630223168X,"When you consider the impact of the Addams Family TV show it's really hard to wrap your mind around the fact that it was only on the air for 2 years.

But decades latter we have a broadway musical and two fairly recent movies to prove that it is still relevant and unique. This is truly a American classic! Nearly anyone over the age of 50 will recogize the finger snapping music and know at least somethine about Thing, Lurch, Cousin  IT, Uncle Fester, etc.

And, of course, we also have the orginial comics from an earlier time!

The pictue was, if anything, better than originally shown - it's hard to tell because of the differences in technology, etc. Sound was as good as it's going to be. Acting is 'hammy' just as I remembered. John Astin is superb as Gomez and  Carolyn Jones is wonderful as Morticia.

Ted Cassidy is great as Lurch - Jackie Coogan as Uncle Fester is very memorable as well. The phase, 'you rang' has entered the publics consciousness - in fact I still hear it from time to time today almost 50 years after it was 1st used on the TV show.

This a great show at a very good price - nearly everyone should buy or get this at their local library!

Volume 1 contains the first 22 episodes of the first season.

There's no guarantee what the future may bring, but when the series set was a Deal of the Day it sold for as little as $26.99.

The after the idealistic portrayals of families on TV in the 50's, the 60's brought all kinds of weird and wacky permutations.  The Addams Family, Bewitched, and The Munsters, were part of the early wave of this trend.  The cartoons of Charles Adams featured in The New Yorker, were used as the basis for The Addams Family television series.  Working with cartoonist Charles Addams, executive producer David Levy and the show's creative staff, gave names to the previously unnamed cartoon characters, put them together as a family, and came up with a concept for the program.  The idea was for the unconventional and macabre Addams clan to shock whenever possible, without going too far.

The program features John Astin as wealthy Gomez Addams, a lawyer and dabbler in the stock market.  Carolyn Jones is his cultured wife Morticia, whose hobbies include raising carnivorous plants.  Former child star Jackie Coogan is Uncle Fester, a strange fellow who can power a light bulb by sticking it in his mouth.  Blossom Rock is Grandmama, a witch who isn't malicious.  Ted Cassidy is Lurch, the faithful butler, who entertains by playing the harpsichord.  The Addams' children are played by Ken Weatherwax as the adventurous Pugsley, and Lisa Loring as the gloomy Wednesday.

The program takes a while to develop a formula that works.  While the Addams are kooky and eccentric, except for Lurch, they really aren't particularly frightening.  While Lurch looks the part, he's slow moving and easy going.  Fester has a malicious streak, and sometimes totes a gun, but rarely gets violent.  Thing, the disembodied hand in a box, a most unique character, is an adaptation of an Addams' creation.  Introduced in Episode 20, hairy Cousin Itt (Felix Silla) was not created by Addams, and appears in four episodes in season one.

The program has some provocative elements, one is Gomez's amorous behavior towards Morticia, usually initiated whenever she speaks French.  It's funny, but also kind of weird and creepy at times.  The program also features torture devices, like the rack, vise, pillory, and bed of nails, supposedly as ""therapeutic"" devices to relieve aches and pains.  These are probably not things children would find amusing, so despite the goofiness, The Addams Family, with its mature sensibilities, probably plays better to an adult audience.  Producer Nat Perrin wrote for the Marx Brothers, and there's a lot of Groucho Marx in Gomez Addams' personality and mannerisms.

The Addams are mostly homebodies, as nearly every scene featuring the principal characters, takes place either inside the Addams' residence, or on their property.  Most of their dealings with the outside world involve either visitors to the house, or conversations over the phone.  Often the more entertaining episodes feature a great guest star, or focus on a particular family member (usually Lurch or Fester), in an intriguing way.  Some of the better episodes include:

Lurch Learns To Dance (Ep 13):  Heavy-footed Lurch takes dancing lessons so he can cut up the floor at the Butler's Ball.  Talented Ted Cassidy is hilarious, prancing in a black leotard with Wednesday, doing the twist with Morticia, and dancing the tango with Gomez.

The Addams Meets A Beatnik (Ep 15): A motorcycle riding beatnik (Tom Lowell) crashes at the Addams pad, to avoid dealing with his demanding father (Barry Kelly).

Mother Lurch Visits The Addams Family (Ep 17): Ellen Corby guests as Lurch's mother who believes that her son is the owner of the Addams mansion.  To keep the deception alive, Gomez and Morticia assume the role of servants.  It's great to see the couple out of their accustomed roles.

The Addams Family Splurges (Ep 19):  The family needs some cash for a vacation trip to the moon, and turns to betting on horses to finance it.  Roland Winters guest stars.

Volume One features three fun and informative commentary tracks with surviving cast members Ken Weatherwax, Lisa Loring, and Felix Silla, and author Stephen Cox.  The Addams Family is an unusual program, that appeals to various audiences.  The early episodes contained in Volume One are not the strongest, as the stories and writing seems to improve as the season progresses.",1302134400,5,4934,5.216010165184244

441655,4,630223168X,"This is an interesting show in that it is much deeper than it appears. The show may appear to be about a strange Halloween type family. But just how strange are they?

This show was made in the 60s, when people were being exposed to different lifestyles. And yes. In some ways, the Addams Family is very different. Gomez and Morticia have dark senses of humor; Wednesday is almost always depressed; Uncle Fester likes torture devices; Lurch barely speaks; and of course the additional servant (or pet) is a hand without a body. (Thing)

But what makes this show is that the Addamses ARE A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY. Gomez and Morticia love each other; they love their children; they stand by each other; and even the extended family members (Uncle Fester) and the servant (Lurch) are treated with love and kindness. The differences for the most part are just external. (Not internal!)

Some especially great episodes are when Gomez and his family try to help Sam Hilliard get elected, Wednesday runs away from home, and the Addames do what they can to bring her home, when Gomez, Morticia, and Fester decide to bet on the horse races so they can win enough money to go to the moon, and the one where the Addames all go to court to save Ma ma.

441668,4,630223168X,"""The Addams Family"" Series 1 is a treat. Here's my ""Top 5"".

Firstly, this black and white series doesn't date. Monochrome suits the mock macabre world of the Addams. And they are ""ooky and kooky"" enough to be outside of everyone's fashion universe. Where other shows from 1964 seem better in memory than in rerun, the Addams are better. My prediction? The recently produced Addams Family movies will be well and truly out-of-date before the sixties TV series.

Secondly the Addams Family was ahead of it's time. Today many series pay lip service to tolerance and diversity. As John Astin mentions in the extras to this disk set, the Addams Family had poked gentle fun at the dividing line between conventional and unconventional. The Addams' have a foot in both camps. Outwardly unconventional they believe themselves to be middle of the road normals. Today we're used to people being ""non-confromists just like everyone else"", our self-styled non-confromists wouldn't last too long around Uncle Fester!

Gomez's on screen passion for his wife was, as the extras note, unique in it's time. Another area where the Addams were ahead of the trend. One area they aren't is in simple good manners. Wednesday always (always!) says ""thank you Thing"". How many modern series exhibit children with good manners? Maybe modern series and audiences could learn something here.

Thirdly, the video and audio reproduction in this series is very good. With the DVDs you realise just how central Vic Mizzi's excellent music is to the series. Again harpsichord doesn't date. If it's not 'in' it can't go 'out'.

Fourth, the extras here are valuable, informative and entertaining. They are not an after thought. It's great to see the surviving cast and how Pugsley and Wednesday have grown up. The extras background the work of Charles Addams, the cartoonist creator of ""The Addams Family"", detail the origin and casting of the series, and showcase the music. Hit it Lurch!

Last but not least, the Addams Family is simply fun. And don't we all need a laugh?",1208304000,,2041,4.970674486803519

441674,5,630223168X,"Finally The Addams Family is out on DVD -- one of the most creative and inventive sitcoms of what we today might call ""the classic era."" A wonderful show, wonderfully transferred -- we really have no right to complain about a thing. If you liked the show, buy it, OK? My kids, by the way, age 5 and age 7, think it's the best TV show ever -- and with this show maybe I'll finally be able to wean them from cartoons.

But I'd like to offer a thought here that I hope will be picked up by the MGM executives who have charge of this product. I'm sure there will be further releases of this program -- it seems like there are always ""definitive editions,"" or ""collectors editions,"" or ""new and improved editions"" and whatever. And we can also be sure that within 15 years or so there will be some new product that replaces the DVD. Anyway, let's just agree this isn't the final form in which this show will be released. You folks in Hollywood -- you need to find a way to get us to turn around and buy the same darn product all over again.

Well, here's how to do it. Get rid of that darned laugh track!

The only problem with the original series is that the canned laughter never matched the humor. The writing was witty and droll, and even a bit subtle. The jokes were the sort that might bring a smile or even a chuckle. It was probably the most adult one-camera sitcom that had aired to that date (as opposed to those that were filmed before live audiences). And I suppose that made the original TV executives a little nervous. The show was so darned weird that maybe they decided they had to convince the world that it was uproariously funny. So they went waay overboard with the Laff Box, filling the soundtrack with so many yuks and chortles that you might think you were in a vaudeville house watching baggy-pants comedians spraying each other with seltzer bottles.

Of all the sitcoms aired during the heyday of the laugh track, The Addams Family is probably the worst affected by canned laughter. As it is now, the show appeals to kids and adolescents; get rid of the laugh track and I think it would be easier to appreciate it on an adult level as well.

What I'd like to see is a DVD set that gives the viewer the option of watching the shows as originally presented, with the laugh track, or without it.

I guess I never really thought this sort of thing was possible until I saw the DVD version of the Twilight Zone episode, ""Cavender is Coming."" This episode originally aired with a laugh track, apparently to let viewers know that it was supposed to be funny (it was intended as a sitcom pilot), but with all the canned laughter this particular episode seemed one of the worst of the series. Mildly funny jokes provoked uproarious laughter -- exactly the same problem we see in The Addams Family. But when the series was remastered for syndication in the eighties, the laugh track for this particular episode was dropped, and a totally un-funny program became -- well, mildly amusing. Decades after its original broadcast, you could see this episode as the sweet little story it was intended to be.

If the original unsweetened soundtrack to these Addams Family episodes is still available, I think it would provide the sort of ""added feature"" that would bring new sales -- not to mention a whole new level of interest in the series.

So anyway, Hollywood, take my advice -- you did a good job on this collection, and the next time you want to make money from this product, you can do an even better one. Do this one little thing for me and I promise -- I'll buy it all over again.

Thanks,

Erik Smith",1191369600,11,3614,4.421052631578948
441675,5,630223168X,"TV in the 50s and early 60s was more varied and creative than it often is remembered as having been - think of Playhouse 90, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, One Step Beyond, or the Twilight Zone. However, the sitcom genre was family-friendly with a vengeance: Donna Reed, Leave It to Beaver, Make Room for Daddy, Ozzie and Harriet, and so on. There was and is nothing wrong with shows of this type, except for the fact that these were the only images of domesticity presented in that format.

This, like so much else, changed in the mid-60s, and The Addams Family was a part of the change. I loved the show from the first episode, which aired on September 18, 1964, (and, incidentally, I was smitten by the lady in black played by Carolyn Jones the same night). The Addams family poked fun at the standard TV family as much by its resemblance to one as by its deviance. Like the Charles Addams cartoons on which it was based, The Addams Family stood ordinary conventions on their heads; typical was an early episode in which Morticia finds (horrors!) a baseball glove in her son's closet and holds it up at arm's length by two fingers, as appalled as another mother would be by drug paraphernalia. These people were not merely oddballs, they were seriously dangerous, with children who literally played with dynamite, but were utterly likable for all that. They defied social norms along with all the busybody regulations (property, weapons, safety, and the like) to which most of us long have been resigned. The sensual interaction of Morticia and Gomez differed enormously from the behavior other sitcom couples as well. Actually, it still does differ; contemporary shows have much more randy jokes, but that is far from the same thing.

The first season on DVD arrived in the mail this week. I've been enjoying it as much as when I was eleven, and I still have a crush on the long haired beauty with the lovely gray pallor.",1190851200,2,1921,4.680473372781065

441699,5,630223168X,"As a childhood fan of the premier TV broadcasts, this DVD set is primarily of nostalgia value for me. I was fascinated with the Charles Addams cartoons I found in the New Yorker magazine on which this breakthrough sit-com was based. TV families of the day (Father Knows Best, Leave It To Beaver, The Donna Reed Show, Ozzie and Harriet) all put the emphasis on conformity to being ""normal"" but at times were just too perfect to relate to. Finally we had a rather anti-normal family who appeared bizarre on the outside, but who still cared for eachother and even helped the neighborhood that rejected them. And the passion between Morticia and Gomez added some romantic excitement never seen by TV couples. I see many similarities to The Simpsons here, in bringing some very off-beat behaviour to anti-normal characters with very genuine human needs.

Nickelodeon runs Gilligan's island, Sponge Bob (or is that cartoon network), anyway - NO Addams family! I even wrote Amazon asking if they were EVER going to carry The Addams Family. Of course 3 days later - they did.

This is a GREAT collection of the television show's early episodes. It is well organized, with no commercials or other junk to get in the way of your enjoyment, but I do wish they were more clear on the chronology (this is the pilot, this is episode 1,2,3...). I was concerned at first when I first bought it, as it was entitled ""Volume One"" but gave no reference as to how many volumes there would be, or what the total number of episodes would appear on each disc. When I finally got the DVD(s) I was overjoyed to realize that there were in fact 22 episodes and several bonus features (these were not included in the original Amazon listing).

With all due respect to Raul Julia and Angelica Houston, John Astin and Carolyn Jones ARE the Addams' and thus my extended family. This really is a must-own classic television series that whose magic has not been captured in the attempted spin-offs and recreations. Arthur Hiller is a genius.

441732,5,630223168X,"Broadcast television has rarely been a hotbed of creativity and uniqueness, but be thankful for the heaping helping of both of those qualities in the original Addams Family series. We are unlikely to see such eccentric, subversive, and downright bizarre humor ever again on the small screen. It's about time the series become available on DVD, but there are some issues with this particular release. MGM appears to be trying to stretch out the two seasons of the show into three DVD packages, because there are just 22 episodes here, while each broadcast season had more than 30. Two larger releases would be more efficient and less expensive than three smaller releases. Meanwhile, the bonus features here are weak, with a few amateurish documentaries that are not nearly as robust as faithful fans deserve. The worst is the documentary on the actors, which provides absolutely no information on Jackie Coogan, Ted Cassidy, or Blossom Rock, while giving too much space to Felix Silla (who only appeared sporadically as Cousin Itt). John Astin, Lisa Loring, and Ken Weatherwax are given plenty of room, and well-deserved respect is given to Carolyn Jones. But if this documentary was able to cover some of the show's actors, it could have continued with coverage of everybody.

But my belly-aching above is about a modern DVD package. In the end, that stuff is far less important than the episodes, which are still as uproarious today as they were offbeat during their original TV run. This is quality TV for the thinking goofball. The best thing about the show is how it sends up stereotypes of the happy nuclear family via a group of eccentric weirdos. True family values shine through the kooky settings and ooky character developments, which were far more intelligent than standard monster movie fare. This was also the genius of Charles Addams' original works. The funniest thing about the show is how the family thought they were normal, and that everybody else was weird. And finally, if anyone tries to tell me that the darkly elegant and gloomily lovely Carolyn Jones wasn't the sexiest woman ever on television, I'll konk them on the head with an Indian club!

The sound and picture quality are superb, and it's amazing how much ""new"" material there is in each episode.  By that I mean 5 to 8 minutes per episode hacked out to make way for excess commercials on Aussie TV.  I have seen every episode a dozen times on TV so was amazed that there is so much material in each episode I had never seen:

The first episode starts with Mr Hillard, the truant officer, walking into the yard, then, on TV, he turns round and looks startled at the sight of Wednesday Addams.  On the DVD, to my utter surprise, he walks in the gate, walks up a long winding drive to the Addams house, then starts at the sight of Wednesday.

I have watched the Addams Family since it came out when I was a child and never knew there was a long, winding path from the street to their house.  This is just one of many amazing finds on this great set.

This hilarious off-beat show would not have been aired in the late 50's,because it was too strange and kooky for that gray flannel suited era of American conservatism. And this campy farce would not have made it in the late 60's ,because of the vaudeville silliness that didn't fit in with seriousness of the Vietnam war,racial struggles,Woman's Liberation, and development of real New Age faith-based religions.

441780,5,630223168X,"I remember seeing the ""Addams"" family and the ""Munsters"" when they were being shown in syndication when I was about 8 years old. I remember thinking the Addams Family and the Munsters were similar to one another but in fact, they were completely different. The Munsters were a bizarre looking family trying to lead a normal life and blend in with society. The Addams family were a normal looking family but there wasn't anything normal about them.

Gomez Addams, liked to blow up toy trains with TNT and Morticia loved clipping the heads off flowers, keeping the stems only. Pugsley and Wednesday had very inquisitive minds and they were always getting into mischief at every turn. Uncle Fester, probably the most loveable character on the show loved to sleep on a bed of nails and he could power a bulb by screwing it into his mouth. Grandmama was a witch and she was into magical potions and all things macabre. The Addams family were also helped out by their 7 foot of a giant butler who always managed to scare everyone away and thing. Thing was a dismembered hand that usually answered the phone and dropped off the mail. Welcome to the Addams Family!

The Addams family is 60's television at its absolute best. I'm really happy to have this classic show on DVD, but disappointed in the release format. While you get 22 episodes of the show in amazing black and white, it's not the complete first season. MGM has chosen to release the series in 3 volumes instead of two season sets. The video transfer and sound are really good for a show this old. The video transfers are pretty clear and the sound is generally crisp. I'm pretty happy about the overall quality of this release but I don't understand why MGM chose to spread the 22 episodes over 3 double sided discs instead of 3 single sided discs? The discs contained fingerprints and small scratches on both sides when I opened the set up. Why is it that Paramount studios can release affordable season sets, but MGM & Fox studios release individual volumes?

As he points out, twelve episodes of the first season are missing, thus this is Volume One not Season One. No matter, two cases hold three double-sided DVDs in a slender box, making a reasonably- priced, affordable set.

I wondered if The Addams Family would be as great on DVD as I remembered it. I need not have worried. The Munsters and this series had some of the best writing of the mid-'sixties, and that's saying something. This black and white series is a delight from start to finish. The B&W enhances, rather than detracts from the eery tone of this rendition drawn from Charles Addams' New Yorker comics.

Moreover, this series shows that family-friendly shows don't have to be mindless, moralistic drivel and talk down to kids while boring their parents into a coma. Come on Hollywood! Make some great family shows again and we'll even hook our cables back up!

I LOVE IT.

At last, for crying out loud. This is nostalgia at its best but that apart the product is excellent.

Video and audio quality?

First class, and the set has the special convenience (for me) of having Spanish subtitles and some episodes even have Spanish audio track, this being exactly the one I had when I was a kid and watched the program almost 40 years ago.

When I was a kid I liked the weird things and the train wrecks but now as an adult what I liked the most was that sweet love, mutual admiration and everyday passion between Morticia and Gomez. I liked that very much indeed.

Bonus material is not extensive but it is very good.

441784,5,630223168X,"This is one of the most welcome releases to come out onto DVD.....on many peoples wish list for a long time.

This three disc set features the first 22 episodes in order as they appeared in late /64 and into early /65. Technically they have been excellently remastered and are a delight both audially and visually,crisp and clear.

While the set isn't loaded with extras it does have some nice commentary on a few selected episodes by the then children,cousin It and the author of the ""Addams Family Chronicles"",two or three short featurettes,some photos

and some original drawings by creator Charles Addams.

Seeing these shows again for the first time since their original airing is not only a fond nostalgic trip but it certainly gave me a new found respect for the wonderful talent involved in this show from the technical crew to of course that wonderful,wonderful cast. Each and everyone played this right straight down the line(if you want this kind of comedy to ""play"" it's the only way to go) and were superb at it. Who can forget that wonderful Lurch sound of disgust,Gomez' sudden impulsive bravado and zeal and of course Morticia always there to reign Gomez in in her inimitable low key way???

The Addams family made the uncool,cool and the different acceptable. They turned the ""Father knows Best"",""Make room for Daddy"" or ""Donna Reed Show"" images on their collective ears and came at life from a totally different perspective....redefining ""normal"" in the process. They were trying to tell us all in a sense to be a little more tolerant of societal outcasts....different wasn't necessarily to be shunned and ridiculed.

Quite a message for 1964 but one I felt then and feel even more today. And however different the Addams Family was viewed by those that came in contact with them on the show the point was usually totally lost to most of them that the Addams's were actually in a very real sense more normal than they were. The Addams Family was just that....a very close knit and LOVING family. The fact of not only THEIR closeness but how important their  living relatives and family history were was a recurring theme throughout the shows' run.

The Addams Family I cannot recommend enough and especially to Moms and Dads today looking for something the entire family can sit and watch together(geesh,whatever happened to those days??).There simply has never been another show like this one on the air before or since and I'm glad to see it still remains to many a TV classic because that's just what it is.

They may be a gothic family and seem a little wierd to outsiders but in fact function very well together as a family, and are respectable and benevolent. They have a really cool house too.

441806,5,630223168X,"The Addams Family was a slightly more sophisticated 60's comedy that featured eccentric characters carried to the tenth power. The basis of this sit/com is of course Charles Addams' comic strip of a fictional gothic-horror family where the abnormal is normal. Each member of the family has a hobby or interest and their house features perhaps the most interesting collection of unusual props ever to grace the screen. This collection of DVD's is nicely transferred and although it is not a complete season there are plenty of episodes. As usual, each episode focuses on one of the characters. Some of the better ones concern the Addams history of backing losing candidates in elections, where Gomez shows Morticia a collection of presidential loser posters going all the way back to Stephen Douglas (lost to Lincoln) and the first episode sort of makes us familiar with the eccentric props inside the residence. There is a good Halloween story that involves Don Rickles as a Bank Robber. The Addams family is always at home and are generous to a fault when people ask for donations. 5 dollars can become 5 thousand very quickly if you hesitate. When they run out, Gomez simply has the Butler go down to the basement and grab another barrel, in an area full of barrels as far as the eye can distinguish. Good light fun.

The most shocking thing about how the Addams Family was dispite all the weird wonderful trappings of their home.  Despite all the odd ball relatives they had.  Dispite all the odd foods they ate it was suprising how normal they all were.

Morticia Addams loved her husband passionately as he Gomez was in passionate love with his good lady wife.  Morticia and Gomez showed to the family and the world that time had not staled or made mundane the love burning in their hearts for each other.  As a child I think it would be awesome knowing my parents were so totally in love with each other.  The children were strange but again their love for their parents, and all their weird pets, extened family or servants never failed.  One of the most enduring memories of the series is that they all always polite enough to thank thing for lending a hand whenever needed.

I guess thats what I love most about the Addams Family is that it suggests weird alone is not bad.  The Addams Family was fun fare to be sure, but it also taught me to enjoy life as I am no matter what others think.  As a disabled child growing up in the 1960's world of rigid conformity it was so nice to see in the members of the Addams Family examples of uniquely odd but good hearted people who so totally enjoyed being different from the norm.

I was always sad the Addams Family series had not made it to DVD.  I used to come to Amazon.com and enter Addams Family only to see the more recent movies result from my searches.  I was at work on break when I found the Addams Family Series Finally made it to DVD!  I literally howled with a giddy gleeful joy that likely shocked my co-workers!  I brought the Addams Family DVD's immediately because, it was for me a total no brainer.  I will be waiting in the light of a full moon to buy the next installment of the Addams Family Series.

According to sources, this small melody could not be licensed for DVD release and is therefore being replaced with ""it's so nice to have a man around the house"".

While I am pleased that this news was released BEFORE the street date of he DVD, I am still not pleased that the distributors could not make a more concerted effort to secure licensing rights.

People who saw this show in its original television run (I am one such person; don't figure out my age, LOL) want to see a program the way it was broadcast on television, NOT with generic music or edited scenes simply because of rights issues.  Problems with licensing are NO excuse for shortchanging consumers of the chance to see a beloved cult classic on DVD.

Once again, I suggest to distributors, if you are unable to secure the rights to the original music or other material, do NOT, I repeat, do NOT, release a program on DVD in the first place; this is a waste of time and money, and if the problem with music licensing means a favorite program will NEVER be released on DVD, then SO BE IT.

*****

TV simply doesn't get much better than this. Its taken far too long for this hugely influental piece of television history to make it to DVD.

I just bought this today. I've already found myself howling with laughter. The brilliance still shines brightly even after all these years. The wit, the dark humor, the goofiness and yes, even the whole Gomez/Morticia thing still burns white hot.

Other reviewers have offered the breakdown of Vol I and what episodes it includes. So I won't restate that.

The picture is in gorgeous black and white - as it should be. The transfer is clean and the audio is good for a 40 year old TV show.

I will confess disappointment that John Astin wasn't included in the commentary. His thoughts would've been priceless. It saddens me he's not there. Not to dismiss those who took part. John was essentual to that show. To not have his input in commentary - feels incomplete.

I have a few other tiny nitpicks - like why flippers (DVDs you have to flip to watch all the episodes)? Let me be honest though - release of this show has been so incredibly overdue by the powers that be at MGM - I'll take it with minimal complaining.

Short and sweet - essentual pioneering comedy every fan of great intelligent comedy shouldn't be without.",1161734400,5,1315,4.613733905579399

The vocals aren't even removed, so it's not much of a karaoke. Three episodes have commentaries provided by Ken Weatherwax (Pugsley), Lisa Loring, who's still a delicious hottie (Wednesday), Felix Silla (Cousin Itt), and Stephen Cox, Author of The Addams Chronicles. The picture is nicely restored and the sound is clear and full. My only disappointments are They did not include the Unaired Pilot (This is the reason critics praised The Addams over The Munsters whose pilot episode was downright silly. Not the actually series). And on a personal note, after the end credits rolled they omitted Ted Cassidy's powerful baritone voiceover ""THIS HAS BEEN A FILMWAYS PRESENTATION"" unless that was for only some episodes. Has anyone else noticed Grandmama is not on the front cover?  In reference to SPY QUEEN.

441830,5,630223168X,"The Addams Family, the OTHER 1964 sitcom about a macabre family of eccentrics, finally makes its way onto DVD in all its black and white glory. Like The Munsters (which originally debuted 1 week later), The Addams Family ran on television for two seasons, and became more popular in TV syndicated reruns than during its original broadcast. No doubt due to the show's memorable cast and classic theme song by composer Vic Mizzy, who also provided the vocals and fingersnaps.

The Addams Family (who were fleshed out and also named expressly for television by original cartoonist Charles Addams himself) starred Carolyn Jones as macabre matriarch Morticia Addams; John Astin as her wildly enamored husband, lawyer Gomez Addams; Jackie Coogan as Morticia's Uncle Fester; Blossom Rock as Grandmama, Gomez's mom; Ken Weatherwax as son Pugsley; Lisa Loring as daughter Wednesday; Felix Silla as Cousin Itt; and six-foot-nine Ted Cassidy as Lurch the butler and as Thing, the helpful hand that popped out of the boxes throughout the family mansion. It should be noted that Cousin Itt was not a part of the original Charles Addams cartoons, but actually created for the show by producer David Levy.

if you're like me then you were obviously a fan of the motion picture based on this series.  The movies overall enhanced the sense of black humor to the proceedings, and there is still that sense of black humor in the TV series, but bear in mind that it was a TV series from the 60s, and while some things might be somewhat tame or even dated by today's standards, there are others that are quite daring for its time and overall still quite enjoyable today.

for example, it was something of an unspoken rule that a husband and wife on television could not sleep in the same bed or even display any outward affection for each other.  On this show, even though I do not think they've ever shared a kiss, it was quite clear that Gomez and Morticia had a very healthy marriage, in hearing their pet names for each other, seeing them dance together or touch each other affectionately, or in seeing Gomez passionately kiss Morticia's arms up and down whenever she spoke French, it was damn obvious they had a VERY healthy marriage.  But it was also a very effective symbol to married couples, that the passion doesn't necessarily need to die down after two people have gotten married.

Also, the lifestyle of the family in the fact that their interests and hobbies may be seen as abnormal by societial standards, it does give a clear indication that the Addamses weren't afraid to be themselves and more often than not considered the norms and practices of 'ordinary' society to be abnormal.

After all, it's not everyday your child comes running home from school crying her eyes out because she heard a story at school of a dragon being slain by a knight in shining armor.

And let's not beat around the bush, if you're feeling a bit stressed out by life's problems, what better way to relieve stress than to stand on your head for a few hours, or maybe blow up a few model train sets?

Such is the beauty of this show, and why we enjoy watching the Addams clan in all their wonderfully weird and eccentrically entertaining exploits.  I've waited for this show to come out on DVD, and it's about freaking time too.  :)",1156118400,20,2279,4.547677261613692

441833,4,630223168X,"Originally aired in 1964. America's creepiest, kookiest family is here in 3 episodes of the original television series.

The Addams Family Goes to School - The village truant officer, Mr. Hillard, pays a visit to the Addams home to find out why little Wednesday and Pugsley are skipping school. He finds Morticia busy tending her garden of hemlock and poison ivy, while Gomez is obsessed with blowing up bridges on his miniature train set. It is quite an education for Mr. Hillard.

Morticia and the Psychiatrist - Teetering on the brink of normalcy, 9 year old Pugsley abandons his pet octopus for a puppy, much to the horror of Morticia and Gomez. Even worse, the mortified parents have caught their son wearing a Boy Scout uniform, playing with a baseball bat and helping an old lady cross the street. Like any good modern parent, Morticia seeks the counsel of a psychiatrist.

Morticia Joins the Ladies League - Gorgo the gorilla has escaped from the circus. Naturally, he is graciously accepted into the Addams family...much to the mortification of members of the ladies league invited to tea. Pugsley makes a pet and pal out of the hairy fellow, but Lurch is disgruntled because Gorgo tries to take over his household duties. It's enough to make everyone go ape.",1141430400,,1268,4.8341013824884795
441834,5,630223168X,"Remember the Addams family ? From 1964 to 1966, an entire generation grew up watching the antics and misadventures of this mysterious, eccentric and unorthodox family, who were polar opposites to the clean-cut, ""Leave It To Beaver"" or ""Father Knows Best"" families on television in the 60's. They were based upon the cartoon sketches of artist Charles Addams in the New Yorker magazine. The cast included Jon Astin as Gomez Addams, the father and head of the family, Carolyn Jones as his wife Morticia, Lisa Loring as their daughter Wednesday and Ted Cassidy as their tall, zombi-like butler, Lurch. The jokes and gags of the family are well known and always comedic. Gomez is a high-class lawyer, of Castilian/Jewish ancestry who loves to go on Safari and who is passionately devoted to his wife Morticia. He would become aroused whenever Morticia spoke French to him. Morticia is a dark, mysterious, intelligent, artistic and classy woman with not so average values. She has raised Pugsley and Wednesday to be so secure in their peculiar ways that the normal people are the odd ones to them. This occurs in the pilot episode, in which Pugsley and Wednesday are sent to school through the admonishment of a truant officer, Mr. Hilliard. But Pugsley and Wednesday prove to be too bizarre and difficult for Mr. Hilliard to handle. Memorable is the scene in which the kids become frightened after reading the Grimm fairy tale ""Hansel and Gretel"" and Morticia deems the story too violent because a witch is killed in a hot oven. The second episode has the Addams consulting a child therapist to check on Pugsley, who has displayed ""normal"" behavior- joins the Boys Scout, plays baseball, etc. The Addams were a family like no other, with the exception, of course, of the Munsters, who were also on their own tv show at the same time (1964-1966). Available at Amazon.com are several episodes of all the seasons the Addams Family were on television. Sit back and enjoy the comic stylings of this unforgettable family. The shock that this must have been to normal families of the 60's are parellel to the same way the Osbornes on MTV continue to surprise their audiences.",1043971200,8,2164,4.867208672086721
