8175228,5,B000N6UEQG,"Bloodhound is a great Gem.

I just started watching this show again after three years, and it's still great. The idea of a high school girl teamed up with a Vampire, foiling the plots of wrong doers, can't be beat. And the whole series is done with a tongue and cheek  attitude as Rion regularly challenges Suou about his vampirism and his lack of menacing presence. Well at least his lack of menacing presence towards her.

The first disc throws you right into the center of the story and quickly draws you in as we come across the likes of an invisible man, a vampiresque killer, and a  pervert who stalks school girls. The episodes are done really well and add just the right amount of humor to keep us entertained. Suou, or Bloodhound as he's called, is a what I would consider a reluctant hero. He wants to do what's right, but at the same time he doesn't want all the  attention that comes with it. Thus he stays in the shadows as he and Rion solve their mysteries. The obvious awkward attraction they have towards one another shines through and only  adds to their already uncontemporary situation.

The show just gets better as the series continues and doesn't disappoint on any level. My only compliant is how short lived this series was. It lasted for only twelve episodes. It could have gone on much longer in my opinion.

Bloodhound is a great example of how Live Action Anime is supposed be and it hits all the right spots. Highly recommended if you're interested in it, or if you like just Vampire stories in general and want something with a new twist.

8175233,5,B000N6UEQG,"This is a review of the WHOLE ""Bloodhound: The Vampire Gigolo"" collection-- Volumes 1,2 & 3. (Easier than writing 3 seperate reviews...hehe.) Also known as ""Vampire Host"" in Japan, this is loosely based on a supernatural comedy manga.
GIVE IT A CHANCE!!!
I found and bought the first volume at, of all places, Big Lots. Never heard of it before then, so, I had no idea what I was in for. When I started watching it I realized something...it was VERY CHEEZY. And yes, that was a GOOD thing. The series is done that way deliberately and it works well. I do think it's one of those cases where you have to ""get into the rhythm"" of the idea being portrayed. Once I did that I fell in love with it. It didn't take long. I got into the characters and their playfullness and I was hooked. And don't worry...even with the title ""Vampire Gigolo,"" it's NOT SLEAZY. There are several suggestive parts, but, they are the ""innocent"" suggestive type. Very clean overall although I wouldn't recommended for young children.
The main premise is a fun one. Read the above product description for that.....OK...all done? Good. See? Sounds fun. That is just the vehicle that gets things going. Once the schoolgirl, Rion, gets her foot in the door of the host club, that's when the trouble begins. She deliberately breaks an expensive bottle of wine not realizing just HOW valuable it was. So, to pay it off, she must now work as a waitress/maid/flyer-passer-outer for the club-- all while wearing very cute cosplay outfits. Rion soon learns that the vampire host, Suou, she's keeping her eye on is ACTUALLY a vampire, but, a good one. Once odd supernatural events begin happening around the area they are drawn by circumstances into investigating them together.
The supernatural mysteries are simple but very fun. There are some very clever twists and turns during the course as well. Also, as they investigate, what begins as a very cutely combative chemistry turns into a rather sweet relationship of loyalty and trust. I really liked the way they interacted with each other as well as the scooby dooish mystery solving. So if you like cute, silly, low-budget stuff and/or enjoy Japanese humour this may be something you'd like very much. Another similar series very worth checking out is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Horror-Family-Complete-Collection/dp/B000H8RVLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Horror Family - Complete Collection</a>",1246924800,9,2480,5.187032418952619
