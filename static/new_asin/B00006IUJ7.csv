Each concentrates on a 5-7 min. set comprising basically the most famous premises from each comic. Not necessarily a great or comprehensive collection, but nice as an intro. to each comic's particular style. Brad hosts.

7969694,1,B00006IUJ7,"This DVD runs only about 44 minutes, instead of the listed 60 minutes.  Each routine segment is about 3 minutes long and a few aren't even that funny.  Although Brad Garrett's impersonations (especially Bill Cosby's) are extremely funny, this DVD is a huge disappointment.",1048032000,,272,5.159090909090909
