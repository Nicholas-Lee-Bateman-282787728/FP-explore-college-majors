3934320,3,B002HOP43A,This is  just another documentary of many about the Berlin Wall. It lacks of  professional filming technics . Content is as sad as every thing  related to the Wall and the suffering of Berliners can be. This clearly shows how  authoritarism doesn't care about people. It should never happen again.,1407542400,,297,4.88
3934321,5,B002HOP43A,"Before the rise of reality tv and the popularity of documentaries in the aughts, documentary film-making was made up of a relatively small group of dedicated people. I went to school for documentary film-making in the 90s and loved McElwee's movies. The pacing is a lot slower than what we are now used to (in my opinion). And in his movies there are a lot of moments to really think about what it going on.

So when watching ""Something to Do with the Wall"" at first I had to re-acclimate my mindset to a slower more pensive one. But as the film unfolded I saw that the footage he and his wife got was really mesmerizing. When they shot at the wall in '86 and '89 it was such a momentous time. You really feel the simmering dissatisfaction in '86. It is a perfect time capsule. And in '89 it is so fulfilling to see everyone chipping away at the wall. The sounds of the hammers and the smiles popping through cracks in the wall from the Eastern side are really moving. This film a great way to really get a sense of what it was like in Berlin in the '80s. (At least one facet of it.)",1395273600,3,1083,4.206730769230769
3934322,5,B002HOP43A,I was in Berlin in the 80's. Everything in here was factual and well presented. Even saw a character I had forgotten all about. Would recommend this for anyone who has an interest in the Berlin Wall.,1387670400,4,199,4.405405405405405
3934323,4,B002HOP43A,"Just as Tarantino will likely never surpass Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, nothing Ross McElwee ever does will equal Sherman's March, but now that he's collaborating with his wife, his films have taken on a new dimension. They still retain the dry humor and wit exhibited in his other films, though. McElwee fans will want to own this.",1361664000,2,336,4.810344827586207
8370419,3,B002HOP43A,"The documentary has some good period clips of the Berlin Wall, both before and after its fall, and some of the characters which lived in the West. However, the structure of the film is a meandering mess.  I am ultimately left with disappointment with what might have been done by the filmmakers.",1517356800,,295,4.673076923076923
8370420,3,B002HOP43A,"It was ok, informative; however it became repetitive and slightly boring.",1443139200,,73,5.7272727272727275
8370421,1,B002HOP43A,"There was no point - other than shots of westerners looking over the wall to original Potsdamer plate, did not show impact of the wall on east and west.",1441238400,,152,4.275862068965517
8370422,4,B002HOP43A,"A good documentary! With real connections to what life was around the wall, this is valuable to hear and see from people and look at the wall both before it came down, during it coming down, and also afterwards.",1438819200,,211,4.435897435897436
8370423,5,B002HOP43A,I really enjoyed this documentary.  I visited the Berlin Wall and went through Check Point Charlie in November 1987.  This program took me right back to that time.,1437868800,,163,4.785714285714286
8370424,4,B002HOP43A,Great,1434153600,,5,5.0
8370425,4,B002HOP43A,"Living in Berlin from 1985 to 1887, it was interesting to see the changes the fall of the wall brought in 1989.",1428883200,,111,4.090909090909091
8370426,5,B002HOP43A,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.  There is no narration, just footage of real people.  The footage showed a great array of people and personalities, with many memorable quotes.  It was not a 'traditional' historic documentary, but rather one that shows life and people as it existed.  The people in the movie are so memorable, I would love to see a follow up to see how everyone in the movie is doing 25 years later.  Highly recommended for people who want to gain insight into what Berlin was like at the very end of the wall's existence.",1428364800,,544,4.56701030927835
8370427,5,B002HOP43A,Great if you love the Cold War and Ross McElwee!,1419465600,,48,3.9
8370428,5,B002HOP43A,"This is like a home movie from the mid to late 1980s of happenings around the Berlin Wall.  Its kind of folksy and personal, almost a documentary, but really more of a scrapbook of memories.  It does a good job capturing the atmosphere of the time, the people, the clothing, the grittiness of the city near the wall.  The fact that its not a big budget documentary is exactly what makes it interesting.  A lot of fun for anyone who was there or whose interested in what it was like in Berlin as the wall came down.",1415577600,,514,4.268041237113402
