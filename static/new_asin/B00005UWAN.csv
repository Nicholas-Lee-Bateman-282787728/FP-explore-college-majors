7955597,1,B00005UWAN,The other reviewer was being too kind in their review of this video.  The doofus who made this video is a complete nob.  I can't think of his name but I have seen 3 of his programs and cannot believe anyone would release them.  They are all bad but hilarious to watch.  The guy is so gullable.  What's even funnier is some of the people he interviews seem to know this and take advantage of it.,1147478400,,394,4.131578947368421
7955598,1,B00005UWAN,"First of all it looked like a home movie, second they seemed to be most bent on proving that the images they captured on tape and camera were real.  It was an absolute bomb, did not at all seem like a real documentary and it was just plain stupid.  The only reason why I even gave it 1 star was because the stories scared me not the actual footage/pathetic excuse of a documentary.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME - YOU WILL NOT GET IT BACK!",1090454400,5,433,4.070588235294117
