There was no climax at all, the bad won over the good till the end. Is there 2nd part of this film ?",1270598400,,277,3.711864406779661

It's worth watching however. The story is good enough and the other actors are also good. Recommend if you are a western fan. Also get the ones that continue the story. They are worth watching.",1225324800,2,359,4.294117647058823

1957094,4,B0000VV4I6,"I just finished watching Ned Blessing The True Story of My Life

and enjoyed it very much,  I too wonder how it ends.  If it is a TV pilot then bring it on,  We need more interesting story lines on television then just Law and Order, CSI's the world over, that seem to be always on the air ways.  Too many soap operas night and day not to mention reality shows.  As for the previous review, the Ned Blessing The True Story of My Life I watched starred Danial Baldwin  not Stephen, maybe that is why you did not enjoy it.  This movie was not by any means an Oscar winner but very enjoyable to just sit down relax and be entertained for a few minutes.",1151193600,2,649,4.095238095238095
1957095,1,B0000VV4I6,"This is an augmented television pilot, not advertised as being so, with an abrupt ending distressing to a viewer who might be so unfortunate as to still be watching a production insulting to any with a modicum of intelligence, due to a storyline that makes no pretense at logic, rather instead stringing together a structure of episodes each more foolish than that preceding, with essentially no sense of continuity. It would seem that the primary purpose of this affair is to demonstrate the costuming talents of Michael Boyd, whose work is often very effective, but here only grotesque, as surely never were denizens of the Old West so brightly raimented in such an array of heterogeneous colours, with all garments seemingly impervious to even a scantling of soil. Director Peter Werner (""We Were The Mulvaneys"") and scriptor William Witliff (""Country""; ""Barbarosa"") are accomplished craftsmen and it is difficult to accept this clich&eacute;d and terminally stupid composition as handiwork from either, a possible explanation being preparation and production interference for what purportedly became a popular television series based upon the lead character from this film, Ned Blessing (Daniel Baldwin). There is innovative camerawork, crisp editing, and some fine players earning credit for their skill at delivering their lines with straight face, but the plot provides nothing in the way of character development or plausible motivation, yet offers perhaps the most protracted and cartoonish scene of meaningless violence ever shot.",1139529600,,1540,5.474789915966387

A pretty poor movie to begin with but it just ends abruptly only part way through the story.  Searching for the missing parts which weren't apparently missing but never existed, I turned up a TV series from another time that was for sale only.  I know Bezos is a vile liberal but after this scam I was starting to feel like some raghead who had purchased influence from Hillarious only to find my piles of greenbacks had disappeared down the rabbit hole when Clinton was squashed like a noxious bug in the election.

Lame acting (including one of the less-talented Baldwins), wandering plot, stale Western tropes, stereotypical Mexican/comanchero villains, a shaman/Tommy Chongesque character who achieves miraculous escapes with poison jimson weed... a shootout that runs like a slow-motion (bloodless) video game.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Romance?  Dopey, dopey, dopey.  I guess this was a pilot gone wrong or something.  Stay far away from this movie - it has nothing to do with the Western genre, and definitely brings nothing new to the screen.  Action/snoozefest.  Awful!!!",1427241600,,633,5.804347826086956

Yep, he knocked the leaf out from underneath the bug and caught it.  I have no idea what they were intending this movie to be.  Serious, campy, funny?  Who knows.

1957177,2,B0000VV4I6,"I'd like to take a moment to clear up the justifiable confusion/frustration by those wondering why the film ends on multiple cliffhangers. Google has answered your questions!

Here's the short version: It was intended as a pilot for an ongoing TV series created by Bill Witliff, who had just written the teleplay adaptation for the immensely successful miniseries of LONESOME DOVE. Remember, this was the early 1990s; more offbeat fare such as TWIN PEAKS, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and THE SIMPSONS were hits, but we hadn't quite reached the real breakthroughs in storytelling and serialization that would come about in the early 2000s.

The series was originally intended to be a picaresque tale of the cowboy Ned Blessing hunting down a band of outlaws and encountering colorful characters along the way, with a framing device of the older Blessing narrating these events while waiting to be hanged (itself an attempt to draw out his lifelong enemy). It was a passion project for Witliff, and many of the actors who reprise their roles in the series version.

The actual series, which came out more than a year after the TV movie, was severely cut back in scale due to budgetary reasons, with a recast Blessing (the bland Brad Johnson, replacing Daniel Baldwin from the TV-movie) battling outlaws as a small-town sheriff. The six episodes of this were edited into direct-to-DVD ""movies"" and are fairly common in discount bins; I haven't seen any other than a charming ep with Stephen Fry guest-starring as Oscar Wilde, and acting everyone else off the screen. CBS, who aired the movie/series, had better luck with the more traditional DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN, and WALKER, TEXAS RANGER, which I suppose is legally a ""Western"" by basic standards.

As a result, the movie you watch here is a bit of a curious beast; it's similar to William Goldman's work with BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (and his later screenplay for MAVERICK), and the tall-tale genre subversion of THE PRINCESS BRIDE. The result doesn't quite work. The first half, with young Ned (Sean Baca, a child actor who got out of the business a few years later) abducted and raised as a bandit by outlaws (shades of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY 20 years later!) is a fun little story, while the second half with adult Ned is violent, confusing, and relies on many a contrived plot point. It all ends in a very violent climax that sets up the men Ned will track down and an (easy-to-figure-out) mystery.

Aside from some nice work by Chris Cooper as Ned's frequently-almost-dead father and Luis Avalos (who passed away earlier this year) as Ned's wry mentor, this is a mixed bag. The series probably wouldn't have worked even in its intended format, but I admire what it set out to do.in creating a witty, offbeat narrative spanning decades. Things that are ahead of their time don't always miss out because they were unappreciated -- sometimes it's just that they don't come together. But it's always interesting to see someone try to do something different, even if it didn't succeed.

Now you know -- and knowing is half the battle.",1413072000,10,3089,4.863117870722434

1957196,3,B0000VV4I6,It could have been a nice movie but does not know any end to the story.  What happened after the movie ended?,1399161600,,109,3.9545454545454546
1957197,4,B0000VV4I6,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The actors did a good job with their role, particularly the younger two--also the ""Mexican"" shaman.

I didn't rate the movie five stars because, frankly I never figured out the plot.",1398297600,,212,4.888888888888889

1957199,2,B0000VV4I6,The movie ended with more story to tell... lacks a conclusion. There was much left to be resolved when the movie ended.,1397606400,,119,4.454545454545454
1957200,3,B0000VV4I6,"Ned Blessing was just a ok western movie to me, but I could not rate it any higher than a three start he treatment Ned got when he was a boy was not real to me.",1397433600,,160,3.4722222222222223
1957201,3,B0000VV4I6,The ending left us hanging and we cannot find a Chapter two. It started with Chapter 1.  It had a good story and enjoyable till the all of a sudden end. What? left open for another movie?,1396137600,,187,4.054054054054054

1957203,2,B0000VV4I6,"This film with a pointless plot was more, unintentionally, humorous than it was dramatic. Unless you enjoy cruelty and graphic violence paraded before you in all its unglory, don't waste your time.",1396051200,,197,5.1875

1957205,4,B0000VV4I6,"These are the stories of the west that no one like to see or hear even though they probably really happened and worse than that, much more could be said. History only know what the the people telling the stories have said , the rest are dead!",1395532800,,242,4.170212765957447

1957208,5,B0000VV4I6,Loved watching this series with my Dad. It ended too soon for us. I really liked Ned's moral personality. Too bad there aren't more law men like him. Can't wait for he next season to start.,1393113600,,189,4.277777777777778

1957210,1,B0000VV4I6,"There was not an ending!!  This movie must have been part of a TV series at one time and this was one of the episodes.  Also, that is NOT a Baldwin on the cover jacket.  Look real close and you will see the original actor.  Not worth the $1.99 I paid!!!",1391731200,,253,3.9019607843137254

1957214,3,B0000VV4I6,"This movie was a little more violent than I expected, but brings out the base nature of wicked people.  It appears to only be one chapter of a much longer story.",1390348800,,161,4.193548387096774

1957216,4,B0000VV4I6,"This was a great movie, had plenty of old fashioned action, a few smiles and chuckles, and kept our interest throughout the entire film.  My only complaint is that there isn't anymore to watch!!!  I want to see the rest of the series.  :)",1389830400,,238,4.363636363636363
1957217,4,B0000VV4I6,"this was a good movie,  which i really enjoyed, the only problem was it would freeze about every twenty second thru out the hole movie, but the audio kept going, but beside the problem, i watched the hole movie.

1957218,5,B0000VV4I6,"Hi:
A very good movie of life in early times.
Gives a life situation that can and does happen.
Would like to know what happened during the mid years
of Ned Blessing's life.
I enjoy this type of Movie and Book.

1957222,4,B0000VV4I6,Really liked this movie.  Was surprisingly well told and acted.  Picked it to kill some time but actually got into the movie.  Good story and acting.,1387152000,,149,4.653846153846154
1957223,1,B0000VV4I6,"I cannot believe I am even taking time to write a review on this--it was bad enough sitting through the movie. I needed to say however that anyone deluded enough to give this movie more than two stars simply does not understand good Western drama. I had to see whether ANY ending could possibly save it but as it turned out, only the fact it finally ended, saved it.
With such a banal script and slapdash story development, this is one you should go out of your way to avoid watching.",1385942400,11,484,4.329670329670329

1957229,1,B0000VV4I6,"The movie was good except there is no ending.  It leaves you hanging.  Thought it might have a sequel to bring it to a conclusion, but apparently there isn't one.  Big disappointment and could have been a really good watch had they concluded it in logical way.",1382140800,6,260,4.48936170212766

1957231,4,B0000VV4I6,"This was actually a pretty good movie.  None of the acting was too bad.  And the story was pretty good.  The sets and costumes were all top notch as well.  My only real fault with the film is that there is no ending!  Except that if you have been watching along, you kind of already know how it will end.  It just leaves you curios how it gets there.  So the film begs for a sequel.  The film is still fairly new so we may actually get one.",1381017600,,440,3.9204545454545454

1957234,1,B0000VV4I6,this is the first part of a made for tv mini series...bad acting aside...the fact that we get left hanging is horrible..but i purchased this at a discount store for four movies for 4.99... lol..so i don't think i made as much of an investment as some on here have made for the movie. how ever this does not take away from the fact that the movie was incomplete...i have tried to find the second half online...im not paying a large amount for the movie guarantee...the movie has several different titles so be on guard for look a likes...and you will notice the good feed back is only for a band that some how has the same name as one of the movie titles they use for the film...good luck...,1340409600,2,690,4.315384615384615
8003935,2,B0000VV4I6,As a Western it wasn't great. It appears to be made for TV. The worst part is this seems to be the pilot. So all it does is leave you hanging in a bad way. I see there are additional movies you can buy for the series. I wish it wasn't recommended in my prime account with decent ratings.,1506211200,,287,3.8813559322033897
