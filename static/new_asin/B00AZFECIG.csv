8559585,5,B00AZFECIG,"You do not need to be of the Jewish faith to LOVE THIS MOVIE.  It is a hoot, laugh riot, with many poignent scenes about life, dreams and humanity.  Timeless.  In Spanish with English subtitles.  (It was purchased it as a gift for my brother's family and THEY LOVED IT!)",1417392000,,270,4.34
8559586,5,B00AZFECIG,"This is a remarkable film.  The story begins immediately following the death of Moishe, quiet possibly the worst Jew in Mexico (from a halachic standpoint, anyway), and follows his sorely dysfunctional family's efforts to come to terms with his passing during the week-long Shivah after his burial.  Meanwhile, two decidedly Chasidishe angels, Aleph and Beth, are watching the goings on and making an effort of their own to weigh in on the quality of Moishe's soul.  Juxtaposing elements of telenovela, culture-clash comedy, Magical Realism and Chasidic fable (among other things), the film is very playful and keeps the narrative rolling with a familiar formula of unforeseen events that hit the main characters when they're least expecting them until, finally, things clear up and the family emerges no worse (in fact, better) for wear.  This aspect of the narrative is handled very effectively by everyone involved (actors, director, writer) and delivers an immensely entertaining movie.  Where the film goes above and beyond expectations is in its deep but subtle reflection on Jewish life in the modern world.

What does the film have to say about Jews and modernity?  The key moment of reflection comes at the end of the Shivah when the angels, Aleph and Beth, find that, to their surprise and chagrin, they're unable to make sense out of Moishe's soul.  Everything is too complicated, they say, and the entire film is in some ways a prologue to this epiphany.  When Jews lived in the world of the shtetl (which the angels are coded to represent through their Chasidishe clothing and manner), the Jewish soul was easily comprehensible and could be discussed and analyzed in concrete, absolute terms like good and evil.  Now that Jews have fully engaged Modernity (and Post-modernity), they and their souls can no longer be understood as they once were; the old discourse of the shtetl and the world it reflects falls short.  This is a dazzling insight that the film presents in a wildly delightful manner.",1406851200,,2011,5.045317220543807
8559587,5,B00AZFECIG,"This was enjoyable for me to watch; although I'd agree with a review I once saw that described it more as a novella with funny parts than a comedy. As a Latina and a Jewish person I had a special interest in seeing the film, but I think most anyone who enjoys foreign cinema would enjoy it as well :)",1394928000,,300,4.016666666666667
8559588,5,B00AZFECIG,"Great movie! I loved Mexican Shiva! (Need not be a Mexican Jew to enjoy it.)
This movie is well written, informative (if you need a refresher course on the rules of sitting shiva), funny and climactic!",1268611200,6,201,4.611111111111111
