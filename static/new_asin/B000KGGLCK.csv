2690169,5,B000KGGLCK,"I HAD THE OPORTUNITY OF WATCHING THE CONCERT LIVE FROM LONDON. I WAS

AMAZED BY THE MUSIC; STAGE; DRESSES (OR CUSTOMES); THE LIGHTS AND THE

FABULOUS DANCERS. THEY CAN FLY !!!!!. I ALWAYS LIKED MADONNA'S LIVE CONCERTS; BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN.I RECORDED IT FROM

TV ON DVD; BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO PUT MY HANDS ON A REAL DVD WITH SURROUND

SOUND. THE COLORS ARE ALMOST UNREAL LIKE NOTHING I HAVE SEEN BEFORE.

  FORGET ABOUT HER ""PERSONAL LIFE"" AND ""POLITICAL VIEWS"" AND SEE HER

FOR WHAT SHE IS: AN AMAZING ENTERTAINER WHO STILL LOOKS GREAT FOR HER

AGE.

2690170,5,B000KGGLCK,"I was always a big fan of Madonna, but never like I am now. I had the amazing chance to see her live on her last tour. And thats one of the reasons why I cannot wait for this DVD to come out. Her concerts are just an unique experience. This DVD is perfect for fans, but if you're not a fan you might become one after seeing this concert, is just that awesome. I know it will be totally worth it. Madge please,  never stop!!",1166486400,10,423,3.9186046511627906
2690171,5,B000KGGLCK,"I think some people in the media are really going overboard with their comments about Madonna,as she has always been a person to go beyond the limits,and she is outspoken in her beliefs,and I see nothing wrong with that. I have never seen her in concert before,but have many of her concerts on DVD or VHS tape,and can attest to the fact that she is a great singer and stage performer. I can't wait to get her latest concert release as I saw the TV special of her concert in London,and it was by far her Best. I know that Madonna sets the record for highest grossing tour by a female,so I wonder who comes in second to her on that. I also know that my other favorite artist,Tina Turner,sets the record for the most tickets sold,20 million tickets for 6 tours,and I would have to believe that Madonna is second to that record. Whether you like what the artist believes in or not,you have to agree that Madonna is ageless and her ""live"" concerts are something to remember and watch over and over simply for the electrifying dance moves and her talented dancers. I see Madonna singing and dancing into her 60's just like TINA......",1166313600,11,1127,4.475728155339806
2690172,5,B000KGGLCK,"Madonna described the tour as ""turning the world into a giant dance floor"". The show is divided into four separate acts with different themes: Equestrian, Urban Bedouin, Glam Punk and Disco Fever. Madonna's Confessions Tour was a concert tour organized to support the album Confessions on a Dance Floor and set the record for the top-grossing tour ever by a female artist. The tour grossed more than $194.8 million with a total of 60 shows and 1.2 million people in paid attendance through North America, Europe, and Japan. Despite the U.S. lack of good taste in music and by refusing to give her radio play for her Confessions CD, she still managed to gross more than $80 million for the U.S. shows alone throughout the summer. In The U.S. her confessions tour instantly became the highest grossing summer tour of the year 2006. The tour has generated international controversy due to its use of Christian religious symbols. While singing ""Live to Tell"", Madonna hangs from a mirrored cross wearing a crown of thorns around her head. Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups in North America and Europe came together to criticize what they saw as Madonna's exploitation of ""sacred"" Christian symbols and labeled the show as blasphemous even though they never saw the show. Madonna brought more than just the Devil out in some of these Christians and other religious groups. A 63-year-old Dutch priest was even arrested when he decided to make a confession of his own when he confessed to making a hoax bomb threat in an attempt to stop her concert. In response to the criticism, Madonna personally and publicly invited Pope Benedict XVI to see the show while she was in Rome - insisting that she was doing the controversial act to raise awareness and money for orphans abandoned in Africa (particularly Malawi) due to HIV/AIDS and that ""Jesus wouldn't mind."" (While she sings ""Live To Tell,"" in the background run haunting images of the devastation in Africa right now. On the top of the screen, a count begins from 0 until it reaches 12 million - the number of orphans created by HIV/AIDS in Africa alone. The tour features songs mainly from her Confessions on a Dance Floor CD which is considered Madonna's comeback album from her previous lowest selling effort American Life. Confessions on a Dance Floor's sales are near 10 million worldwide. It also holds the record for topping the most charts in the world. The single ""Hung Up"" also holds the record for topping the most charts in the world. With Confessions on a Dance Floor Madonna refused to follow any U.S. chart trends. She decided to release a collection of dance/electronic songs, which did not receive significant airplay in the U.S. but received massive airplay on all other parts of the world, including Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, despite lack of U.S. radio support (boycott because she spoke out against the war and that idiot president bush) all of the singles had a great performance on iTunes and on MTV's TRL Video Music Countdown. Madonna kept her goals of doing what she wanted and establishing trends instead of following them. Even lack of support in her home country didn't stop the album from selling over 1,600,000 units in the U.S. alone. This is one amazing show and one of her best tours. Madonna is still The Most Successful Female Recording Artist in the history of the world and this DVD proves she is far from singing her last song.

2690198,1,B000KGGLCK,"Terrible. I couldn't even watch the DVD.I have tried about 10 times to watch it.  The DVD format is not compatible with USA Blu-ray or DVD player compatibility. I get an error on the television screen saying that it is not compatible. Wish I could get a full refund, but I think I have had the DVD for too long. Very disappointed and will never buy from this seller again. It should have been made clear that this DVD is not compatible with USA Blu-ray or DVD players.",1409788800,,468,4.318181818181818
2690209,4,B000KGGLCK,"This filmed concert was originally on British telly but made its way to DVD.  Pushing 50, Madonna has never looked better.  But then when hasn't she looked fit?  Even in the more recent 2009 ""Sticky Sweet"" show she looked great.  As usual, Madonna's music spans a range from her early years to what she is doing currently.  And the show isn't so much about the music but the performance.

This is a big production with interactive videos, lighting and dizzying special effects.  Madonna also intersperses numerous ""public service announcements"" on backing video screens consistent with her various humanitarian projects.  The music is very good, mostly danceable numbers but the real treat is the choreography and the numerous athletic acrobatics.  It's all pretty remarkable.

On the downside, the chopping quick editing is very disconcerting.  Don't plan on focusing on any one look more than a second or two.  For some reason directors and editors think this is all very cool.  It isn't.  I'd like to be able to absorb the whole show as if I were sitting (or standing) in the audience.",1361491200,,1088,4.939226519337017
2690210,1,B000KGGLCK,Took much longer to receive in the mail than promised and when it arrived it did not work. The disc was the wrong format to played in any DVD player in the United States. Very disappointed!!,1335052800,,190,4.305555555555555
2690211,5,B000KGGLCK,"If Madonna created even nothing more afterwards, The Confessions is DVD to have, presenting a mix of S&M inclinations, erotism,music and top performing.

Timeless work.",1268006400,3,168,5.72
2690212,1,B000KGGLCK,"I have collected all of Madonna's released concert DVDs and have been highly pleased by all.  But I have a sad confession to make about this one: I hate it. A headache developed in my head from the camera constantly changing the screen on every shot it took.  All of the fast pacing of the screen shots, and constant flashing of the stage lights left me shocked that no one editor took this into consideration.  Most of this DVD is not a ""live"" performance.  It is produced like one big music video and makes the title a lie. I'm surprised ""perfectionist"" Madonna didn't notice this before it was released. Also, Donna and Nikki are missing.  Her 2 new female companions dance behind her but do not move their lips - utterly useless except for visual dancing purposes.  The horse concept and riding was a very cool concept and would have been totally cool without the hint of beastiality.  Oh, and the crucifiction scene - she's trying way too hard to shock. She moved in the wrong direction - a truly dark side. Don't waste your money on a concert that will give you a headache and others a seizure. Grab her older concerts presented with much better taste, real dancing, and the ""live"" performance that is promised.",1258156800,,1217,4.580645161290323
2690213,2,B000KGGLCK,"While I had this video from iTunes, it got corrupted and I lost it. I purchased it, and found it was not formatted to U.S. DVD - and as such, was limited to only ""4"" times I could switch the format on my computer to watch it. I wish there was info on that before I bought!",1252800000,,272,3.789473684210526
2690214,1,B000KGGLCK,It had the wrong country code so the disc wouldn't play in the US. We had to go through the company for a refund and the whole process took over a month! I don't recommend using this company.,1245801600,,191,4.052631578947368
2690215,5,B000KGGLCK,"I have never been big on Madonna, and have never really cared for some of her other performances. I have to say though that the Confessions Tour has to be one the best concerts she has ever done. She deffinitely puts on a good show. She has amazing dancers, and a really good band behind her. I reccommend this to anyone. It's deffinietly worth watching. Two thumbs up!",1193529600,3,369,4.4411764705882355

OMG!!  Incredible!!  Put your opinions aside and just enjoy this concert!!  I know I will over & over & over again!!  What a show!!  I definitely think it will be worth the one-week wait to purchase the DVD/CD combination on January 30th.  The CD will most definitely go right onto my IPOD and become my signature work-out music for 2007!  Absolutely inspiring that this hot mama is almost 50!! Madonna most DEFINITELY has the life-long ""legacy"" staying-power as Tina Turner & The Rolling Stones.  Her history and musical legacy will go on long after she & the rest of us have all left the planet... ROCK ON, GIRL!!  AAA+++",1167696000,10,904,4.774193548387097

2690218,5,B000KGGLCK,"I've seen hundreds of concerts in my lifetime, but this one is one of the best i've ever seen- the final Prince one being a close second. The themes are amazing, the costumes are awe inspiring, and the Madonna sounds as phenominal as ever. I saw this concert in Madison Square Garden and the energy in that arena just blew me away! I taped it on TV, but it sounded aweful so I just got on Amazon today and noticed there was a pre-order form- definitely going to get this one for my collection!

Thank you Madonna for inspiring me to become a powerful modern woman!
