6094445,5,B00GO481PM,Wish I could buy additional movies but it won't let me cuz it's Canada/Us issue,1422748800,,79,4.333333333333333
6094446,3,B00GO481PM,I was very disappointed to find that Season 5 was the exact same as Season 4 UP version. And I couldn't return that one without returning the 'season 6' which to me was season 5.  I decided to return my UP version season 4 but it was too late.  It would be considerate to make it clear that there is a different schedule. The only difference I could see was that the 'not as seen on UP had french titles as well as English. I'm assuming it is the Canadian version.  I LOVE the series though.,1420156800,12,491,4.09375

6094451,5,B00GO481PM,"The Heartland series is a wonderful love story about a loving caring family and the discovery and experience of the never to be forgotten feelings of love between a young adult man, who had not experienced much love from his family, and a young woman who had experenced the` tragic loss of everyone but a widowed grandfather and her sister.  The grandfather is wise, loving and kind but structered.  This all happens on a large ranch just above the Canadian-American border whhere the scenery is breathtaking and the young woman applies her love and charms and a whole, new person is created. It's a story most of us have expeienced for ourselves but for me it additionally recalled my own experience more than 50 years ago. I could also anticipate the excitement and joy my wife, Libby, and I experenced as our two sons grew up, fell in love and permitted us to experience the even greater joy of grandchildren.  I reccommdend the series to older teen and adults alike.  The rev. Dr. James Rush, retired United Mthodist Pastor.",1411948800,,1028,4.726256983240224
