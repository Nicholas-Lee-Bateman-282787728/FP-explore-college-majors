8384309,5,B002YNQED8,This little gem does what I've been waiting for a movie to do for a long time - pay tribute to classic science fiction films without trying to be cheesy on purpose. It was made in 2009 but plays like a true classic 1950's scifi flick. The actors take their roles seriously. The alien story comes right out of the past. In its charming way this movie even has some suspense. It has a slight amount of humor but is not a comedy. There is some cheesiness but only the cheese that would naturally come from a scifi movie of its day. The humor is not tongue-in-cheek. And the viewer is not in on the joke - because there is no joke - just a loving tribute to a wonderful genre of yesteryear. I love classic science fiction films and this movie is both worth your watch and worth my money. This one is a real charm.,1494460800,,809,4.159235668789809
