8448803,3,B004YTDU14,"The reason I chose this was I already had a Gunnar Peterson DVD using the fitness ball....and it was a good workout without undue strain on my knee...which is recovering from an injury.  This DVD doesn't. Too much pressure on my knees. Maybe later on I will be able to use it.....but right now, it seems like a waste of money.",1371168000,,326,4.344262295081967
