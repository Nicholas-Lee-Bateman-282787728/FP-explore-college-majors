2935988,2,B000VBIGC2,My child will not watch this one. It has old kids in it not babies and is not near as good as Praises and Smiles.,1304899200,2,113,3.56
2935989,5,B000VBIGC2,Moms should get this Praise the baby collection for their kids. It is a wonderful way to nourish your kids souls.,1293494400,,113,4.428571428571429
2935990,5,B000VBIGC2,"My now 10 month old has been watching the Praise Baby series of DVDs since around 3 months and he absoultey adores them.  While he will glance and maybe watch other shows like Mickey Mouse for a few minutes, Praise Baby will keep him locked in for the entire time.  He laughs and squeals at the other children in the videos and loves the music.  As a Mom, I don't feel badly about letting him watch because 1) it's educational - constantly showing numbers and letters 2)it's praise music which we love!  I HIGHLY recommend this and the other Praise Baby DVDs.  Start with 'Praises and Smiles' -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Praise-Baby-Collection-Praises-and-Smiles/dp/B0001GWBOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Praise Baby Collection: Praises and Smiles</a>&nbsp;- or 'God of Wonders' -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Praise-Baby-Collection-God-of-Wonders/dp/B0002XVKLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Praise Baby Collection: God of Wonders</a>&nbsp;- if you don't have any yet.

2935991,5,B000VBIGC2,"The praise baby series has done it again!  Lovely images and songs to set the mood this holiday season.  let it run while trimming the tree, baking cookies or taking an afternoon nap.  My kids love it! (5, 3 and 1 year old)",1291161600,,223,4.1395348837209305
2935992,4,B000VBIGC2,"As the mom, I love the Praise Baby collections. I think the songs are sweet and I like the adult singers. But I do think these are dependent on your child.  I have an 18 month old who could care less about these videos (or any TV for that matter). I started them when she was maybe 3 months and she's just never been engaged by it. I still put it on occasionally though, hoping one day she'll like it!",1283472000,,401,4.0125
2935993,5,B000VBIGC2,My baby loves these DVD's and actually so do I!  We have all of them!,1280016000,,69,3.6

2935996,5,B000VBIGC2,"My son loves this (he's 2) video, as he does all in the series.  I would recommend this Christian video (and all Baby Faith videos) to any parent!!!",1199318400,4,148,4.285714285714286

2936000,5,B000VBIGC2,My one year old son loves to watch all of the Praise baby videos! A big hit in our family and it gives me time to take care a few things around the house.,1412035200,,154,3.5588235294117645
2936001,4,B000VBIGC2,"I love praise music and so does my son.  These dvds are great for our bedtime ritual, easy listening and wonderful images.",1403136000,,122,4.545454545454546
2936002,1,B000VBIGC2,"I have all the original Praise Baby DVD's (God of Wonders. Praises & Smiles, Born to Worship, and Sleepy time Lullabies).
My review is dealing with the video on the DVD.  Whoever made this was a computer person and often didn't even follow the simplest ""rules"" for photography and video recording.  As a result, we get an overly busy, dull, and uncreative video lacking in animals, nature and the great outside.

1. General video feel is very monotonous and the images do not inspire creativity. They use the same computer generated images over and over again with very few nature shots. (In the place of shapes ans ""smiley faces"" we get weird geometric shapes that look like a science fiction dream.) The video content seems almost ""computer compiled"" rather than humanly edited.

2.  They overlap computer generated images with and on top of the regular ""kids"" shots as rotating frames. These frames detract greatly from scenes. In general, they put moving frames around almost every scene. I thought all photographers knew about keeping clean backgrounds -- especially when your focus is a face!

3. Green screen is used instead of real props, backgrounds or animals. This is also disappointing. Seriously, is it that hard to go to a beach or a playground?  I think there are very few -- if any real nature shots in this DVD. This is in contrast with the other Praise Baby videos which show children playing outside and animals quite a lot.

In general, it makes me wonder what ever happened to the people who worked on the other DVDs. Whoever worked on this video was more a ""computer guy/gal"" than a photographer or video director/editor.  it is not good to watch. In fact, I find the repetition, weird, over-done computer art, and lack of nature scenes overwhelmingly  annoying.",1401235200,6,1784,4.838815789473684
2936003,5,B000VBIGC2,"My daughter absolutely loves all of the praise baby DVDs--they are calming, educational, and my daughters' favorite ""movies"" of all time! (she has enjoyed these since she was 3 months old and she is 22 months now). The Christmas one was no different--she loved it every bit as much! I would highly recommend all praise baby movies!",1388880000,2,331,4.824561403508772
2936004,5,B000VBIGC2,My daughter loves Praise Baby DVDs! This one isn't quite as visually stimulating as the others but it's still good.,1388707200,,115,4.8
2936005,5,B000VBIGC2,"use these for a nursery class. the music is great, very calming, and songs that I like. the images/video is also good for a background image (it's not really a video, just a slideshow of attention-grabbing images (like an elephant, a ball, some blocks, etc.) for babies/toddlers). all the praise baby collection is highly recommended; and this Christmas one is nice",1373846400,,365,5.0
2936006,5,B000VBIGC2,My grandaughter  is in love w/ these...... I have several and am spreading the word to my friends.  they will make great gifts.,1370476800,,127,4.478260869565218
2936026,5,B000VBIGC2,"My triplet sons looooove all the cd's for this series. We watch them over & over. It is a great way to sing, learn new things & my sons actually look forward to me turning them on.",1369180800,,180,3.891891891891892
2936027,5,B000VBIGC2,"We ALL enjoy this DVD.  The music and production are very well done.  I like the options for child or adult voice, too.  Great product.",1367020800,,135,4.32
2936028,5,B000VBIGC2,"The music is so relaxing and the children love watching. This is one DVD you won't dread putting in.  In fact , I put it on while I clean house just for the tunes.",1361318400,,163,3.7941176470588234
2936029,5,B000VBIGC2,I have bought these sets for my grandbabies as they were born.  a great way to start their little lives with the words of Jesus,1354838400,,127,4.08
2936030,3,B000VBIGC2,"I was thrilled to get this DVD.  I heard a lot of good stuff about Praise Baby from a girlfriend that doesn't steer me wrong.  I was bummed to not find a deal on this DVD, but bought it anyways and hoped for the best.
The music is beautiful- very soothing, but the videos are lacking.  It is the same 5-7 children over and over.  Sometimes they have a ball to play with, other times a train.  They are mostly on a green screen with no background.
The animations are alright, but very pixelated and grainy on my TV screen.
I have to say, I'm disappointed  product overall.  If I purchase other Praise Baby items, I will check them out at the library first.",1354492800,,655,4.233870967741935
2936031,5,B000VBIGC2,"If you want something the whole family can sing along to and your kids will love Praise baby collection is it!!  My 2 year old walks into the family room and every time says ""my movie?""  Not a day goes by that he doesn't want to watch.  Love they use real people and animals!!",1352764800,,276,4.074074074074074
2936032,1,B000VBIGC2,"This is a first for me! - Even as an anglo (white), I was offended by how ""white"" this DVD was. I have never noticed this focus in any other Children's video I have watched, until this video. I purchased this video for our broadly multi-cultural church, but I can't in good conscience use it. I don't want to belabor the point, just warn others in a similar situation of its content. We currently use other Praise Baby Videos, and I have not noticed this issue, but I will certainly go back and check.",1351641600,,501,4.340425531914893
2936033,1,B000VBIGC2,"I was very dissatisfied with this DVD.  Born to Worship had so many different kids playing and having fun.  My girl loves that.  I bought this hoping it was similar but a Christmas version.  Joy to the World had too many scenes of the choir kids, kids opening gifts, older kids, and computer generated entertainment.  Did not like it at all, neither did my little girl.  Not worth the money.",1347926400,,391,4.514285714285714
2936034,5,B000VBIGC2,We used this in our preschool room for babies at our church and ALL of the babies loved it! It's even great for the adults to listen to!,1325116800,,136,3.892857142857143
2936035,5,B000VBIGC2,We all enjoy this DVD.  My seven month old grandson loves it as well as the three year old grand daughter.  I like putting it on to listen to as I clean.,1324598400,,153,3.75

8217946,3,B000VBIGC2,"The first two minutes that I was able to watch were as good as I expected.  Unfortunately the ""very good"" used disc I ordered skipped so badly I could not watch further.  It was returned.",1480723200,,187,4.314285714285714
8217947,5,B000VBIGC2,A favorite for Christmas,1477612800,,24,5.25
8217948,5,B000VBIGC2,Had to have the entire praise baby DVD set with our first born son (now 6 years old).  Just love the music and way it captures a baby's attention.  Unlike other series this one makes strong attempt to show diversity with babies of all races and capabilities.  Ultimately love the videos and would recommend over Baby Einstein line.,1476144000,,331,4.672413793103448
8217949,5,B000VBIGC2,My guy love all of the praise baby videos! It's great for trips for Babis that hate the car seat and now that he is one he is singing some of the songs from the other videos! He prefer the videos over the cd!,1457654400,,208,3.75
8217950,5,B000VBIGC2,I left a detailed review on the Praise baby collection. ...I absolutely LOVE them and would ABSOLUTELY recommend these to anyone with a baby coming or with babies already!! These have mesmerizing visuals and captivating songs. My granddaughter had lived them from a few months old to now 2 1/2 years old. She nows shares in her love for them with her new baby sister :-) I love not worrying about what they is putting in their eyes and mind with these videos. ..order them if you don't have them! ! I can't say enough good things !!! :-),1454198400,,537,4.434343434343434
8217951,5,B000VBIGC2,Can't wait to use. We even popped it in now in October,1444608000,,54,3.5833333333333335
8217952,5,B000VBIGC2,These are highlly recommended. My grandbabies love the whole series. They bless me too. I could listen all day. We love songs about God and Jesus.,1444089600,,146,4.653846153846154
