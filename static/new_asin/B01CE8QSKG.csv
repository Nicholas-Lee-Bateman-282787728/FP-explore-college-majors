Yep Bruce is really down on his luck, and we are reminded of that old saying,"" never hit a man when he is down, Kick him it is easer.""

After assessing the situation he comes to the conclusion that his situation is the direct results of gross negligence on the part of his maker. He makes the monumental decision to express his thought. Naturally in the tradition of the ""Oh God"" movies, only this time Morgan Freeman is god, Bruce is challenged to see if he could do any better. This time instead of, ""Death takes a Holiday"" (1934), God takes his. Now that Bruce has a chance to be in charge. What changes will we see? Was Bruce's assessment of the situation correct or a tad jaded from the situation?

Of course this is a formula movie with the outcome determined before we start. Jim Carrey relies on his ""Carrey faces"" to carry the movie. These facial expressions were cute in ""Once Bitten"" (1985) but get a little long in the tooth by now. Jennifer Aniston, of ""Office Space"" (1999) fame, does an excellent supporting role.",1497139200,,1042,4.478947368421053
