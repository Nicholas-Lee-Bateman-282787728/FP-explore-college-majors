8238104,4,B0010OIP52,"I read the book this is based on.  First I'll say that I think Barbara Hershey is miscast but she did an o.k. job. Bundy role is good casting - certainly not as good as Mark Harmon in The Deliberate Stranger - but good casting.  For anyone who knows very little about the Bundy killings this is a good movie.  For those of us who have read several books about it, the movie doesn't contain enough of the details.  I guess they did the best they could in the time they had to tell the story.  There are some errors that should have been caught.  The last victim in Florida after the coed murders was a very young girl, a child, not the sexy young girl they used.  The one thing that makes a big impression is one of the last few scenes where his ""wife"" realizes that he really is guilty after she has had a child by him.  Now, that is a scene worth watching. If you want to see a good mini series about Ted Bundy, get The Deliberate Stranger starring Mark Harmon.",1391126400,,962,4.134408602150538
