8111804,4,B000ENV2EQ,"I am currently a youth basketball coach. I coach kids from ages of 10 to 17. I have teams that play local basketball and I have an AAU squad. I purchased this video to help me with new skills to present to my youth basketball teams. This video really simplified some plays for me and helped me to implement more things into my offense. This is a okay buy if you have young kids around the ages of 10 to 13. The video goes through fast break drills as well. The great thing about the fast break drills is that it shows the kids how to set up into their offense when they come down the court. I used this drill to help my guys understand how to get in the right positions when they get down the court. If you are looking for basic plays and basic information for your kids, then this is a great buy. It is not complicated and really not for those older kids who are ready to advance to the next level.",1290816000,,899,4.056179775280899
