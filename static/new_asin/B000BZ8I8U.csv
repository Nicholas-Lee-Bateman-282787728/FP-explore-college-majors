8094759,4,B000BZ8I8U,"Very good concert from Jesse McCartney. This concert was from what I consider his overall best work so far still here in 2015.

Great favorites of mine played here: Starts off with maybe my favorite WITHOUT YOU. That Was Then, The Stupid Things, Get Your Shine On, Why Don't You Kiss Her?

Personally I've always considered Jesse McCartney a combination of legendary artists JAMES TAYLOR & MICHAEL JACKSON!

Get this show and discover what the future holds.",1433635200,,457,4.909090909090909

8094762,5,B000BZ8I8U,I bought this for my daughter who loves Jesse McCartney and she had this video when she was younger. She has watched it several times and loves it.,1365033600,,147,4.285714285714286
8094763,5,B000BZ8I8U,"If you like concerts this will do it for you.  It comes with an hour long DVD of his concert plus a bonus cd with unreleased material, including a remake of Blackbird.  The quality of the DVD isn't too bad, some parts can be blurry but that's very minimum has in like less than 10% of the DVD material.  It has two audio options, and that's about it.  Nothing else.  If you have the Beautiful Soul: Live cd, it's mainly that, but with video.  It's well worth it.  It's only 16.88 at Walmart.com so go pick up a copy (On Internet only).  I had to buy this online since no stores sold it.  Hmm...not much else.  The bonus tracks, well here's the tracks...

1. Without You (Stripped Raw and Real)

2. She's No You (Stripped Raw and Real)

3. Beautiful Soul (Stripped Raw and Real)

4. Stupid Things (Stripped Raw and Real)

5. Blackbird (Stripped Raw and Real: Unreleased)

6. She's No You (Neptunes Remix ft. Fabolous: Unreleased)

Well worth the 17 bucks.  Get it if you don't.  And get the Live cd also.  That's worth it too.",1139616000,4,1025,4.351063829787234
