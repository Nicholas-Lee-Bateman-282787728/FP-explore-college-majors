3730453,5,B001OLY1YU,"The first Bruce Lee film i watched was the Chinese Connection.  I was twelve years old and saw it at the Drive-in theatre.  Imagine the effect a 30 foot tall Bruce Lee in action would have on a twelve year old boy.

  At first the title of this DVD sounds rather grandiose but after watching it you will realize that Mr. Lee really did have quite an effect on the whole world.

  The history channel really did an excellent job of making a professional film.  The producers certainly prove their point, that Bruce Lee's influence does impact the way things are done today, in entertainment, films, martials arts, clothing (yes clothing), fitness...  Being a Bruce Lee fan of many years i was quite surprised by some of the things Bruce has influenced, and often found myself saying, ""Hey, that's right, he did influnence that!""

  Try to watch this with someone who is maybe not such a Bruce Lee fan! lol",1276128000,,904,4.575

3730455,5,B001OLY1YU,"""How Bruce Lee Changed The World"" is a very interesting and entertaining biography produced by the History Channel.  Rather than just focusing on Bruce Lee's life, this program's focus is on how Bruce Lee influenced many areas of popular culture and society.  Martial Artists and Bruce Lee fans will definitely enjoy this biography, but I think fans of action movies will also enjoy seeing Bruce Lee's impact on action cinema.  However, what some viewers may be surprised to learn is that Bruce Lee influenced more than just martial arts and movies.  For Bruce Lee fans, this DVD will be a must for their collections, for others it will be an interesting look at a man who had tremendous influence on different arts even though he died much too young in 1973.

The biography has chapters on Philosophy, Breaking Stereotypes, Martial Arts, Physical Fitness, Attitudes in China, Action Movies, Music, Branding, and a short bit at the end about where he is buried and about future plans for things regarding Bruce Lee.

The chapters of the DVD contain interesting segments on freerunning, mixed martial arts, and bodybuilding with several freerunners, mixed martial artists, and bodybuilders stating that Lee's philosophy, ideas, and training helped shaped these popular sports and training.  I also really liked the segments with Shannon Lee in Hong Kong and China where a memorial park and museum are being created.  They are also planning a museum in Hong Kong in Lee's old home.  I also found the other chapters interesting as well.

It's a very well done biography, which one would expect from the History Channel, with footage from Bruce Lee films and private video of Bruce Lee as well as many other interesting scenes and interviews.  It's fast paced and keeps your attention throughout.  Near the end of the DVD there is a short segment regarding a celebration about Bruce Lee in Seattle where Lee is buried beside his son, Brandon, who also died much too young.  There are plans for a museum to be created in Seattle as well.  That's a place I look forward to visiting one day.

Here is a list of the people interviewed in this biography:

Rapper/Actor LL Cool J, Director Brett Ratner, Actor/Comedian Eddie Griffin, Comedian Margaret Cho, Former World Champion Boxer ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard, VP of The Weinstein Company, Asia Bey Logan, Bruce Lee's Wife Linda Lee Cadwell, Author/Collector David Tadman, Shaolin Monk Sifu Shi Yang Ming, Musician RZA, Actor/Choeographer Donnie Yen, Film Critic Grady Hendrix, Film Director Rob Cohen, Actor John Saxon, Hong Kong JKD Association's Lewis Luk, Bruce Lee's Former Student Taky Kimura, Author David West, JKD Instructor Tommy Carruthers, UFC President Dana White, Bruce Lee's Daughter Shannon Lee, UFC Fighter Ben Saunders, UFC Trainer Joey Varner, Former Bodybuilding Champion Flex Wheeler, Muscle & Fitness Magazine's Mike Carlson, Actor & Stuntman Yuen Wah, Film Producer Raymond Chow, Film Director John Woo, Director of the Shunde Memorial Park Huang Dechao, Stunt Coordinator Thomas Sinn, Actor Jackie Chan, Basketball Legend/Actor Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gorillaz's Damon Albarn, Marvel Comics' Stan Lee, and Creative Director of Toy Advertising Agency Ari Merkin.

Besides the excellent hour and a half biography, there is another short biography, just over four minutes, on Bruce Lee in the special features.  This has more scenes of Bruce Lee and a couple of interviews with others.  This short piece focuses on a chronological account of a couple of high lights of Bruce Lee's life, not his effect on the rest of the world like the main biography.  Nice little addition, but I wish it would have been longer.  There is also a selected filmography that includes his movies and television shows.

For anyone who is a fan of Bruce Lee, or who is interested in the martial art/movie legend, this DVD will be highly enjoyable.  Even after all these years after his death, Bruce Lee is still a remarkable influence and this program shows a small part of it.  Highly recommended for all Bruce Lee fans, and recommended for others who want to know more about Lee and his influence around the world.

3730456,5,B001OLY1YU,"I strongly believe that Bruce Lee changed many facets of the world and without him the world would not have had the many advances in sports/martial arts/advertising and entertainment. I know I sound like I work for some lame company but nope, I live in little Las Cruces, NM and thought this movie captured the spirit of one of my personal heros. Bruce Lee.

3730457,4,B001OLY1YU,"I have been a fan of Bruce Lee's for over 30 yrs.now, essentially most of my life. I am familiar with much of the information in this DVD, however, it is quite impressive to see how far Bruce Lee's influence has been felt beyond people who are not only martial artists, but come from many other disciplines as well. That I did not know. Though I greatly doubt I will ever come close to being the martial artist he was, he has often served as a compass for me to continue striving and growing,and not only in the martial arts. For this, I am grateful I dicovered him as a boy initially. He was mortal as we all are,but what he accomplished in his short lifetime because of his determination, is as inspirational as any spiritual leader could also hope to achieve,in my humble opinion. Here was an individual who in real life,was the David to the Goliath. He helped bridge the gap between the East and West, and thereby bridge the divisions we make amongst ourselves,our fellow man. At a time when he faced much opposition, makes him that much more admirable. It is great to see Linda and Shannon Lee on this DVD, and to see how they intend to continue perputating Bruce's legacy for future generations. I recommend this DVD to any martial artist, and to anyone curious as to who Bruce Lee was and why he even mattered.",1266537600,2,1317,4.446280991735537

3730460,5,B001OLY1YU,"This is an amazing DVD. I own several Bruce Lee documentaries and this one is the best. Lee influenced all different fields from martial arts to contemporary MMA to comic books and music. Some of the people he influenced are Elvis, LL Cool J, Stan Lee, Jackie Chan and world champion body-builders. He was truly a pioneer and 35 years after his death companies still make millions, if not billions, from his name. Pure gold. It also features a chapter about how his family like his daughter, Shannon, is preserving his profund leagacy. Bruce Lee was one of the biggest stars the world has ever known.

3730461,5,B001OLY1YU,"Bruce Lee is referred to as ""the king of martial arts"" for a good reason. He was a man who was ahead of his time. Some would say a revolutionary. Having only four completed films under his belt (only one being a Hollywood film), Bruce Lee not only became an inspiration but still is one to this day. Many of his techniques (whether it's his physical training, dieting, filmography, directing, or philosophy) are still as influential and are being utilized everywhere from the east to the west and everywhere in between. There will never be another Bruce Lee, but the impact he left on the world is still being felt 35 years after his death. His popularity doesn't seem to be dwindling at all, but his methods certainly left a long lasting impression. How Bruce Lee Changed the World is a 90-minute documentary chronicling Bruce's amazing life, how his legacy is still in full swing today, and the influence he made on many people all over the globe.

This is a pretty incredible documentary that is almost every bit as good as A Warrior's Journey (AWJ has a slight edge since it has the remastered and original footage from Game of Death) that is a worthy watch for any Bruce Lee fan. Seeing how he influenced not only actors and directors, but musicians, boxing, MMA, and bodybuilders is pretty interesting. The film does a good job of putting into perspective of how big Bruce Lee really was. A man whose teachings seem more relevant today than they did 30-40 years ago deserves to be as big as he is even if he's no longer here to witness it. Bruce Lee jump started martial arts filmmaking and broke the stereotypes set in Hollywood for Chinese and Asian actors during the seventies. How Bruce Lee Changed the World is a great film to pop in to show that friend who doesn't understand why everyone has such a thing for Bruce Lee or is just a great watch to give Bruce Lee fans a better insight into the legacy he left behind and the phenomenon that continues to grow everyday.",1246579200,23,1979,4.543417366946779

3730515,5,B001OLY1YU,"This was a very good documentary by the History Channel on Bruce Lee. That said, there have been many documentaries and books on him, what made this interesting is that it was done with a twist. Everyone who knows anything about most Bruce Lee documentaries are very familiar with the usual players such as students and actors he trained. This piece went a different route by also interviewing people who didn't know him personally but were inspired by him. That, at least for me, made this documentary very interesting and entertaining.",1353974400,,537,4.912087912087912

3730518,2,B001OLY1YU,"Disappointing. It's a given that Bruce Lee made a huge mark as the pioneering Chinese actor in Hollywood, on how martial arts movies are made today, and how how martial arts and mixed martial arts are practiced today. That said, to me, this one just failed to provide an interesting perspective from that meaningful angle. I mean, LL Cool J and Eddie Griffin providing commentary? Really?? (I actually like both of these guys otherwise). I would have enjoyed more insightful perspective on the subject from those who are relevant to the history, his life, and those within the martial arts community. Unfortunately, I found this to be a snoozer. Just my two cents...",1300320000,12,666,4.902654867256637

3730520,5,B001OLY1YU,"I enjoyed this DVD.  It gives a total picture of Bruce and his philophical approach to things.  He has affected so many people in the past and still today with his messages.  Much of the travails that he went through have helped Asian artists to this day as long as influencing others in the positive approach to the martial arts as a way of life and not just to learn how to fight, but to learn how not to fight along with other life lessons. Interesting also were the scenes showing how different activities have been influenced by him. Martial Arts movies are now main stream and even with subtitles, people are becoming interested and seeing the different aspects of martial arts as well as the history of some of the great masters of the past i.e. Wong Fei Hong and others.",1280361600,6,778,4.464788732394366
