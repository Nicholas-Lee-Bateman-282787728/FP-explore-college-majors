2725659,5,B000M5KT86,First of all I am a great fan of Amanda Burton - second I love this type of show. The stories catch you right away and pull you in. The writing and acting is nothing but top quality. If you watch Bones or any of the CSI shows I believe you will enjoy Silent Witness. You need to have an all region dvd player and then a little adventure in your soul as you navigate the menu in whatever language it happens to be. Once done all you have to do is sit back and enjoy. I know this doesn't say much but again top quality acting and writing says it all.,1379980800,4,548,3.9017857142857144

8166540,5,B000M5KT86,Excellent!  I remembered this from seeing the first season years ago...  it is as meaningful now as when it was made and Amanda Burton is fabulous.  I just wish Series 3 wasn't so expensive!!  It was not $50 when I ordered this one...,1448236800,,234,4.372093023255814

8166547,4,B000M5KT86,Good BBC crime drama. My only criticism is the amount of emphasis given personal conflicts among the main characters. Lots of thin skin with everyone taking innocuous comments personally. Sometimes it is annoying! But that hasn't stopped me from watching the series and buying the series I could not obtain otherwise.,1419897600,2,317,5.235294117647059
