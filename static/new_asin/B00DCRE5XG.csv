5791275,4,B00DCRE5XG,"I like this for a multitude of reasons.  These include my impression that it presents worthwhile material to the outdoorsperson, the sportsperson, and the conservationist.  Doing that, it exposes all to the varied problems, approaches, and solution results around the concern for the ecology of the Great Plains environment.  It helped me understand and, in many cases, agree with the tenets of groups other than the ones I normally associate my self and my beliefs with.  Good programs and well worth the time and $ investment.",1382659200,3,528,5.104651162790698
