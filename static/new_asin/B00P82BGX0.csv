6788965,5,B00P82BGX0,The Good Book is a wonderful story of a Bible that travels around people changing their lives as it go. The cinematography is top notch as well as the acting. The musical score is amazing. I would recommend to any church as a ministry tool to be able to share the gospel to many.,1428364800,,279,4.185185185185185
8686784,5,B00P82BGX0,I love silent films. I also love Christian films. This film was satisfying on so many levels. I just loved it.,1529366400,,110,4.285714285714286
8686785,1,B00P82BGX0,"This movie has no dialogue and it's like the same story for more than an hour. I thought that I was going to be impacted, but I wasn't. If there was dialogue, this movie could have expanded more and went more into depth about how radically people's lives were changed. Instead, someone receives a Bible, they smile, and give it to the next person; this goes on for an hour.",1498176000,,373,4.3428571428571425

8686789,2,B00P82BGX0,"I kept waiting for the actors to start talking. I felt like at any second someone would start speaking, that eventually they had to say something. The story is great, the actors to a good job, but silent movies were out as soon as ""talkies"" hit the screen.",1460160000,,256,4.354166666666667
8686790,5,B00P82BGX0,"You won't miss dialogue. This movie tells the story with such excellent acting and directing that you absorb the story within your very soul. Watch it when you have quiet, without interruption if at all possible, and experience a true blessing.",1453680000,,244,4.975609756097561
8686791,4,B00P82BGX0,"This is a wonderful movie about emotions, struggle and encountering helplessness or being lost in moments of ones life. This is a wonderful Christian-based film. A touching emotional journey of several story lines about people struggling in their day-to-day life, all coming to terms with their situation and trying to solve it through the good book a.k.a. The Holy Bible.

This is a wonderful film that incapacitates the viewer in the emotional department and also in the ability to let the viewer relate to the situations at hand. I think all the characters and all the situations of the characters are relatable. The acting is good, the emotional reactions of the actors are good. I think the direction works. The story lines are thought-provoking and is emotionally charged.

I think it's a wonderful film. A teaching tool for those of faith and for those who are of the Christian faith and do follow The Holy Bible. I recommend it for people of faith and that do struggle or are going through a situation and might not know where to turn. I think Sharon Wilharm did a wonderful directing job and I think she wrote a touching reality based film.

It was a moving experience. A very unique film in that it was a silent film. There was no dialogue which makes it all the more brilliant in being able to hold the viewer from beginning to end. I enjoyed it greatly for its emotional faith-based appeal. I enjoyed it for those who struggle and for those who believe. I feel it works and I highly recommend it. I think it touches the mind, soul and heart of those suffering and needing answers. It's geared toward faith and the Bible and the Christian reality and so for those of faith I feel will attach to it.

The music is beautiful that flows with each silent story. The music gives focus and a reality in itself to the scenarios taking place. There is a great mixed bag of attitudes and emotions from comical actions to moments of sadness.

This was produced and created by a husband and wife team through there Mainstreet Productions. Fred and Sharon Wilharm. This is their fifth film. You can see their love and passion for their faith within this film. This was awarded 5 out of 5 Doves from the Dove Foundation which is a family based Movie Review Foundation leading Parents to showcase family oriented films of a good nature for their kids.

The movie is weaved together by a small red New Testament Bible that passes from one hand to the next as it changes seven peoples lives.

Sometimes our choices, actions and experiences are our darkest moments and sometimes we have nowhere to turn. For some there is answers and that's The Good Book.

A touching and peaceful movie that expresses an answer in a belief of a Good Book that changes the lives of all those involved. A family oriented film specifically for the teenage and above because it deals with adultery, stealing and murder and might cause younger ones to ask questions that might be hard to answer.

A passionate example in how to make a thought provoking film, that is unique, touching and a personal reality to all that watch.
