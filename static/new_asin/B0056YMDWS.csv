4593006,5,B0056YMDWS,"My own kids like this DVD and it teaches early math concepts in an age appropriate manner and makes learning fun.  I have used these on special days at school (I teach preschool) when I am allowed to show a movie, but feel I should keep it educational at the same time.",1324857600,,269,4.173076923076923

4593009,5,B0056YMDWS,"My son thoroughly enjoys this DVD just as he enjoys Team Umizoomi 123 which I had gotten him previously. More DVDs like this one, and I will be a loyal purchaser until my son is too old to watch these!",1318377600,4,201,4.05
4593010,5,B0056YMDWS,"My son absolutely loves Team Umizoomi!! He cannot get enough.  This DVD has 3 episodes:  A double-length episode not on TV called ""The King of Numbers"" (which he'll watch over and over again) and then two regular length episodes, ""Picnic"" and ""The Dinosaur Museum Mishap.""  He has the other two episodes on the DVR but loves them as well.  A definite must for any Umi Friend.  Another winner; thanks Team Umizoomi!

The other 2 episodes are fine; favorite being ""The Dinosaur Museum Mishap"".  Have to say it is just okay since 1 of 3 episodes is no good in her eyes.

4593127,5,B0056YMDWS,"My three year old niece loves umizoomi and there are always plenty of episodes online but this dvd has some of her favorites and The content is decent and not overly annoying to adults, the math is far beyond simple 123s but has measurements, rather high digit counting, pattern recognition, and some complex shapes. One episode not contained on this dvd revolves around attaining a golden dodecahedron a shape most adults would be hard pressed to identify. From what i can tell this dvd has one double length episode that at the time was exclusive to this dvd and two bonus episodes probably from the first or second seasons of the show. One complaint many people have with nick jr dvds is that they typically aren't released in full season sets",1405555200,,746,4.702290076335878

My oldest picked this show out when we got our first kindle and then later showed it to our youngest.  You know its a good show when your youngest is willing to learn new words and it is the first movie he picks out the majority of the time when it is movie time.

4593147,3,B0056YMDWS,"My son loves this video and I really like Umizoomi and the number lessons. Plus we are big fans of Blues Clues and enjoy hearing all the familiar voices. However, the first story on this DVD features a bad wizard who casts spells throughout the story. I'm not a fan of wizardry so I had to take this video out of rotation for us after hearing my son repeating the spells during his playtime with his brother.",1369267200,3,408,4.311688311688312
4593148,5,B0056YMDWS,My daughter loves Team Umizoomi since they came out on TV.  They are very educational. My daughter is in the gifted program at her school due to this and many other tools that helps her advancement in match and reading.,1369008000,,219,4.475
4593149,5,B0056YMDWS,"Great show that is fun for preschoolers!  Learning numbers, shapes and patterns.  We are hooked on the Umizoomi team, and this DVD is great.",1368057600,,140,4.791666666666667
4593150,4,B0056YMDWS,"It is the equivalent of 4 episodes.  The title episode is double length, and then there are two additional regular episodes.  For $10, I wish there were at least one more regular episode on the DVD.  That being said, our Umi-loving two year old watches it as much as we'll let him (and the five year old likes it as well).

It's not a bad show in general; there aren't many shows for young kids that concentrate on math concepts, and it is colorful and engaging for the kids.  Bonus, as an adult, I don't find it particularly annoying or grating (it's not Max and Ruby, for instance).  The two year old chimes right in, telling the characters the correct shape or number they're asking about.  He loves counting, and counts right along.  He is even getting the patterns.

In short, it's a pretty good show, but Nick could be a little more generous with the run time on their DVDs.",1367971200,,880,4.416149068322981

I also like all the episodes and think that they are really educational, the characters Milli, Geo and Bot are cute, smart and inspiring. Songs are also very catchy and easy to follow for a 3 years old. However, this particular episode ""Journey to Numberland"" based its story on a wicked wizard who doesn't like numbers. He was casting spells through out the stories and has this scary laughs. It's just not a good theme to expose to little children.",1344384000,9,533,4.5625
