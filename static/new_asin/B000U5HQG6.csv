According to other reviews, the original may have been too long and detailed and this version provides just enough.  I just got back from China and encountered English language documentaries on CCTV and each topic was drawn out: 6 to 8 30 minute segments per topic.  Each segment was very detailed.",1365897600,,436,4.931506849315069
8212122,4,B000U5HQG6,"A striking documentary and history of the Imperial compound in Beijing. The views were striking and the sound track was informative.

I had hoped for a bit more about some of the side buildings and stories of the compound, the ones we passed but didn't have a chance to fully absorb during our half day in the compound.",1292112000,2,319,4.5
8212123,5,B000U5HQG6,"I saw all the 12 original episodes on TV and I love this serie very much! It is the first time that a TV team/photographer was allowed to go into the deep inside of this palace and for most of the treasures which have been collected by generations of royal families from different dynasties(Song,Ming,Qing), this is also the first time that they have been shown to the world. But the most interesting part is how this program tells the story of this palace by putting it in China's history, especially the history after the Opium War, and how people have been trying to protect it and protect the culture this palace stands for during the war time. I get to know that the government has been sponsoring the forbidden City Museum to buy back the treasures lost during the Opium War and war with Japanese, however, little has been told about it. Well, better not to be too greedy, right?  If you can, get the original 12 episodes!",1213401600,3,928,4.523809523809524
8212124,4,B000U5HQG6,"I have watched the original CCTV six hours version of this epic production of THE FORBIDDEN CITY.  It was way too long and too rhetorical, almost like attending a history class.  The National Geographic/CCTV version is really a much more concise version...with a narrative flow that is much easier to follow.  The new VO by Joan Chen was immeasurably better than the original English VO from a CCTV commentator...who sounded like a dull junior high history teacher.  For me, this revised version is doing great justice to a monumental subject matter, making it more fun to watch and accessable to young and old audience worldwide. This DVD reflects a true synergy of western structure and eastern subject matter.",1200096000,6,712,5.008474576271187
