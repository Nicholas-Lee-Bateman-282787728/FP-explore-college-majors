2004114,5,B0001I553S,Uncle Floyd is a national treasure and yet he is way under-rated.  This is a classic collection.,1232496000,2,96,4.647058823529412
2004115,5,B0001I553S,"Great DVD but rather short on ""GREATS"".
I got to see Uncle Floyd when his show was being filmed in Newark. He would do an entire weeks shows in one eight hour day.
I only wish they had included ""Bones Boy"", ""Weenie"" and more of ""Skip""..
How about some of his ""GREAT"" songs that were not covered such as, ""Deep in the Heart of Jersey""...
I Highly Recommend this DVD until something else comes out.",1227484800,6,396,4.293333333333333
2004116,5,B0001I553S,The Uncle Floyd show brings back the classic vaudeville-type humor and also shows Floyd's talent as one of the greatest jazz and ragtime piano players of all time.  I just about fell off my chair laughing at a routine spoofing ukulele artist Tiny Tim and was induced to watch the whole dvd all over again.,1191715200,4,305,4.545454545454546
2004117,5,B0001I553S,"It's been over 30 year since I watched Uncle Floyd on the UHF dial (remember them?).  The reception wasn't very good but I tuned in every day.  The old Soupy Sales shows may be lost forever, but at least we still have Floyd Vivino and company.  His low budget antics certainly helped me pass my high school afternoons.  Do people outside the Middle Atlantic states know Uncle Floyd?  Anyway, it's nice to have Oogie and Looney Skip Rooney back in my life.  My only complaint:  where's Donkey Oatie?",1168819200,8,498,4.590909090909091
2004118,5,B0001I553S,"Growing up in the NY/NJ area during the 1980's, you may have stumbled upon The Uncle Floyd Show.  I'm a fan from way back (even had my pictures up on the wall a few times, lol).

This DVD release is pure fun and nostalgia.  Prior to purchasing this, I was relegated to buying bootlegs of a few shows on VHS, so it's nice to finally have an official DVD release (it's listed as copyright 2004 Floyd Vivino).

Some of the skits included are:

Tom Cavell's Ice Cream College on the Air, Julia Stepchild, Pasquale's Pizzaria, Eddie Slobbo, Sylvester Cavone, Mr. Grouch and Skip's Auto Sales.

There are also a few chapters on the dvd with Floyd playing the Piano, and, of course, Oogie!

If you're a fan, you simply cannot pass this up.

I only hope that even more material has survived for a volume 2 of the Uncle Floyd Show.

(hey Floyd, take Mugsy's tapes and release more official DVD's!)",1124150400,21,888,4.46583850931677
2004119,5,B0001I553S,I have never laughed so hard in all my life than I did when watching this brilliant collection.  I wish Uncle Floyd and the gang were still making new episodes of this amazing show.  You must pick up this DVD.  Floyd Vivino is a genius!,1118188800,,236,4.2
2004120,5,B0001I553S,"I just received this today from Amazon and immediately popped it into my DVD player.  Man, is this great stuff!  This immediately brought back memories of 1980, rushing home to catch the end of Speed Racer on Channel 68 and then the opening credits to Uncle Floyd at 6 PM.  I'm not done watching the whole thing yet, but the first few bits with Oogie, Tom Cavell's Ice Cream College, Julia Stepchild, and Pasquale's Pizzeria were just outstanding.  I'm no Floyd afficionado, but I do appreciat his unique contribution to TV comedy.  I'm sad that we'll probably not see the likes of this material on TV ever again.  But my memories will live on forever as long as this DVD holds up.",1108080000,20,681,4.540983606557377
2004121,4,B0001I553S,"This DVD is great! Not being in the NJ/NYC/PA areas for years, had me longing for the UNCLE FLOYD show! I thought it was gone forever! I decided to check out Amazon.com and to my surprise: there it was!!! The DVD and links to the show!! I just hope he will put out more DVD's!! I laughed as if I had never seen these skits before!  Thanks soooo much for having this available for the public to purchase!!! MORE,MORE,MORE!!!!",1106611200,16,424,4.367088607594937
2004122,5,B0001I553S,"Now I know what David Bowie, John Lennon, the Ramones and Conan O'Brien are on about when they praise the likes of ""Uncle Floyd"" and ""Oogie"". Zany antics coupled with the lowest of budgets makes for something that I have a hard time picturing on television. Highlights include scenes with ""Cuppy"" and ""Foreign Language Program"". I hope that they release another volume so I can find out who ""Bones Boy"" is.

Don't forget to keep your head warm, twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd!",1100131200,14,473,4.7682926829268295
2004123,5,B0001I553S,"Sometimes it seems an invisible hand of fate guides our purchase of DVDs. I had just received Disney's ""Follow Me, Boys!"" and was experiencing some nostalgia for my Boy Scout days, when I stumbled upon ""Uncle Floyd"" and was sharply reminded of what my Scouting experience was really like!  We clowned around at patrol meetings, we clowned around on hikes, and we clowned around after lights-out.  We were the sorriest excuse for a scout troop, but we had a lot of fun! And ""Uncle Floyd"" brings it all back.  I'm sure everyone has some memory of routines like the one spoofing Carvel Ice Cream's After-Easter Clearance Sale.",1086307200,9,623,4.803738317757009
2004144,4,B0001I553S,Great little snapshot of some of Floyd's best! Would like to see a Vol 2 on DVD. Floyd? Whaddya say?,1462147200,2,100,4.05

2004150,5,B0001I553S,"I watch this Show on WSNL-TV Ch. 67 Smithtown,NY at 6:00 in the Evening during the early 1980's. I really Love the show.",1441238400,,120,4.260869565217392
2004151,5,B0001I553S,Lived on NJ during the 80's and Uncle Floyd was standard TV viewing. 40 yrs later maybe just a little slap stick but still funny and well worth a look-see. Also I love the piano playing!!!,1428883200,3,188,4.25
2004152,3,B0001I553S,"It brought back many memories of the zanyness of this great show.
I just wish it was a 2 dvd with more skits from the show.",1416614400,,123,3.769230769230769
2004153,5,B0001I553S,I love Uncle Floyd. As a kid I watched him on cable.  This is a great DVD if your a fan like me.,1411257600,,96,3.1739130434782608
2004168,5,B0001I553S,"This is a wonderful DVD but I got you all beat-I went to college with and personally knew ""Netto""-I attempted to put together a band with him  and our friend Paul on guitar-a truly amazing experience. I think we got through one-two songs (Empty Pages"" by Traffic was a struggle)  and that was pretty much our entire repertoire. Also used to buy stuff at ken's magic Shop in Fair Lawn where Scott Gordon worked behind the counter occassionally. And have met and talked to Uncle Floyd at Carlucci's in Haledon-now that was special, he is a very funny and friendly guy, just like on the show.  And great Italian food. So two great comedians come from Paterson, NJ....Lou Costello and Floyd Vivino. And his brother Jimmy is also a very talented musician, worked with Southside Johnny and many others.",1394841600,,796,4.712230215827338
2004169,5,B0001I553S,this was a gift for a person who remembers his show. It was the perfect gift. Thank you for having this kind of nostalgia on your site.,1386288000,,135,4.037037037037037

2004171,5,B0001I553S,"From Deep in the Heart of Jersey - nice takes from Floyds show.  Oogie, Eddie Slobbo, Conservative vs. Liberal, and the awesome piano by everybody's favorite Uncle.",1371168000,,164,5.074074074074074
2004172,5,B0001I553S,"Although there are some classic ""Floyd"" bits missing here, this is an outstanding trip down memory lane. I loved it! Notable by his absence though was Looney Skip Rooney. This may have been by design, or simply one of the seasons after he had left. At any rate, any good ol' good time Uncle Floyd fan should want this! I wish they would release more with Skip on them! Kudos, Scott!",1362182400,3,382,4.394366197183099
2004173,3,B0001I553S,"This is not the BEST of Uncle Floyd by far. No bands.... the best skits are not here, and the spontaneity is all cut out.",1361750400,2,121,3.88
2004174,3,B0001I553S,"Wow - this was MUCH funnier when I was a little kid.  While it was certainly good for nostaligia, I had to fast forward through most of it.  Great piano numbers, though.  And I have to admit I still enjoy some Julia Step-Child!",1358208000,2,227,4.232558139534884
2004175,5,B0001I553S,This is a fantastic trip back to the 70's!  I loved Uncle Floyd and Oogie and thought their shows were lost forever.  This brought back such memories.  I laughed at Uncle Floyd and his crazy crew as if I had never seen them before!  Uncle Floyd and his nostalgic songs on the piano are a real treat!  I recommend this to all Uncle Floyd fans and hope there will be more coming!,1349654400,3,377,4.180555555555555
2004176,1,B0001I553S,"So excited that there was a DVD on Uncle Floyd because it was funny back in the 80's but this DVD wasn't.  There were so many funny clips that we remembered and none if them were in it.  The only good thing was that Oogie was in it.
Save your money",1315872000,,248,3.843137254901961
2004177,5,B0001I553S,"This brought back many NJ memories for me as I was a guest on the show a few times as an Elvis / Roy Orbison tribute act.

Also I am a friend of Scott Gordon and went to Montclair State Music dept with Floyd's brother Jimmy Vivino of the Conan O'Brien Show (Guitarist).

Across from us was the acting building, as Bruce Willis also went to school with us!

Please release more!!!!!",1235433600,3,381,4.263888888888889

8012978,4,B0001I553S,"I worked on the Uncle Show for ten Years, as Studio Operations Manager for the Production Department for WBTB then became WTVG. My main position was Camera Operator, because there was none better or faster to get the camera shot then me. The TVStudio was located in West Orange NJ for many years, until we relocated to Newark NJ, in a very bad area, but it was big and new facility. There was a lot better Shows that I remember working on, that's why I gave the review only four stars. The behind the seen action was tumultuous at times and argumentative but funny, if you new them. It was the most low bugit and ridculous comedy TV Show ever produced, that's what made it so popular and a big hit, Sometimes there was ""no bugit"" with no money for the props, even Oogie the big star of the show, was found in someone's trash, Floyd found him, and Oogie came alive! with the magic of Uncle Floyd's Vantriloquism. The piano that Uncle Floyd played on, he couldn't keep the payments up, and was repossessed while we were producing one of the shows! Floyd kept playing it while they were rolling it out of the studio to take it back!, LOL. What ever happened while taping the show, we went with it, and kept taping. You never really knew what would happen at times, ""just keep taping!"" no matter what happens! LOL. It's called live on tape. The TV Set on this video is not the better Set when the Uncle Floyd Show became a National Syndication, with the key TV Station NBC in NYC. That's when the best Uncle Floyd Shows were produced, and are not on this DVD. I'm going contact Floyd Vivino if I can, and try and findout what happenrd to those Shows? that's where and when the the best Uncle Floyd were produced. Some characters like Tiny Tim, Peter Tork (from The Monkees) would come by just to hang around because they loved just being there and also being part of the show, they are both great people, along with others that I can't remember at this time. I would say that the most nicest people that I remember that were on the show where Chubby Checker and Linda Blair, they have extreme charisma. Also The Smother Brothers would occasionally come on the show, and Bananarama, Blue Oyster Cult, Paul Somon and The Ramones were there many times. ~ As for me, I wish I could go back in time and do it all again, and know what I know now, It's like they say, You never know what You have until it's gone. Even I was asked for my autograph many times, just because I worked on The Uncle Floyd Show.  I may return to update this review, because I came down with M.S. and can't remember all that I want write about. For those reading this review and enjoying the Uncle Floyd Show that I miss so dearly, thank You. ~ Robert A Sadlon",1479945600,8,2726,4.334637964774951
