8392497,4,B0039WVSFM,"Great film I saw in the UK in the 1980s in a tv series of world films. only found when I checked Amazon.cz. Although clearly dated now, this great sci-fi comedy plays on the classic time travel dilemma. However this is slickly done with a tight script and cheesy but likable characters.",1476057600,,286,4.519230769230769

8392499,5,B0039WVSFM,This is the funniest and well written time paradox movie ever made. Beats Back to the Future and anything else before and after. It is a classic.,1414454400,,145,4.407407407407407
