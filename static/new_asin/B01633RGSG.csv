It was so funny! Be forewarned, you  have to have a certain sense of humor to enjoy Tommy.",1495670400,,260,4.285714285714286
7456033,1,B01633RGSG,"Watched the entire series on HULU, and man, was this rough.  Unlike THE ROOM, which is funny incompetent, The Neighbors is just sheer incompetence, painful in every way.  The worst improv you can imagine, and proof that Tommy Wiseau DID NOT direct The Room, in any way shape or form.",1487203200,4,283,4.64
7456034,5,B01633RGSG,While watching this DVD of Tommy Wiseau masterpiece I was in line to buy fishnet stockings that really seals in the flavor and I was shall continue to watch Tommy Wiseau movies God bless America,1486598400,5,194,4.571428571428571
7456035,5,B01633RGSG,DVD doesn't have any subtitles. But Wiseau's genius is present and accounted for.,1476057600,2,81,5.3076923076923075

7456037,3,B01633RGSG,"Tommy Wiseau is an interesting human being. I continue to support him in his endeavors in acting, yet this ""show"" is not acceptable as a legitimate source of entertainment. First off the sound quality is very unimpressive and suggests an amateur filming process. Tommy himself has a few lines within each episode and the lackluster, outrageously horrible supporting roles take the spotlight. They are annoying and yell a lot. One last thing. The ""intermission"" between each scene is funny at first but after the second time or so in one episode it begins to grate and annoy. This is not fair for someone trying to watch this series and feels like it was done to add a small amount of time to the overall length of each episode. Overall it's funny-ish but not worth the money. Just watch scenes on youtube.",1456272000,6,805,4.716312056737588
7456038,5,B01633RGSG,This is honestly one of the dvds of all time.,1455580800,40,45,3.6
7456039,5,B01633RGSG,"Picture, if you will, an avant-garde collection - nay, cavalcade - of comedic characters cohabitating in an apartment building managed by one of the most dynamic actor/directors of our age. Because that, my fellow Tommy Wiseau enthusiasts, is what you will get when you watch this show.

Have you prepared your body for a production in which Tommy Wiseau detonates atom bombs all over your expectations with his stellar performance as the show's main character? Well buckle up buttercup, because your fallout shelter can't contain the power of Tommy Wiseau exploding on the scene as not one, but TWO of the main characters!

""But wait, reviewer!"" You say, confused, for you are uninitiated into the splendor that is The Neighbors. ""You already mentioned that he is the manager of the building. In what other role can we expect to see Mr. Wiseau?""

It is wise (and duly respectful) that you refer to the legendary actor/director/writer/clothing designer/video game reviewer/basketball underwear model as Mr. Wiseau. Kudos!

In answer to your question, let me tell you about the wonder of Ricky Rick. Because when Tommy Wiseau puts on a blonde wig and a Rooster varsity jacket, you won't even recognize him! But yes, that drug dealer with a heart of gold is in fact Tommy Wiseau, and he plays this character as brilliantly as he portrays the lecherous apartment manager Charlie.

While Tommy Wiseau may be the King of Comedy, the REAL royalty doesn't show up until episode 2, when Princess Penelope storms onto the scene. This previously lesser-known member of the British Royal Family portrays herself in this Emmy-submitted documentary alongside such amazing characters as the paranoid, chicken-obsessed Cici, the forever-bikini-clad Philadelphia, and Tim, who loves ice cream and basketball like every cool American.

Some of life's most important questions cannot be answered until you have enjoyed The Neighbors in its entirety. Have you ever wanted to see the inner workings of the tenant application process? Any questions you may have will be answered in episode one! Do you know what Triple Vanilla Sex is??? Episode six will teach you! Can you comprehend the Pavlovian effect that listening to the same interstitial techno music dozens of times per episode has on the human body? Well, by the end of this show, you will be salivating. For more The Neighbors, that is!!1

""Also"", there is a ""special appearance"" by ""Fidel Castro"" in this ""show"".",1454457600,31,2452,5.0997506234413965
8735470,5,B01633RGSG,"A zany set of episodes from Tommy Wiseau, just outlandish and random humor. If you liked The Room, this is similar in sense of humor, but done in an even more over the top, sitcom style. Visit my site for a full review.",1528761600,,219,4.116279069767442
8735471,5,B01633RGSG,"Weird and rambling, with no discernible theme or plot, this is a series of almost ad-libbed episodes of a show set in an apartment building which Tommy Wiseau manages. Tommy plays two different characters, distinguished by a ludicrous blonde wig. If you are even looking at this, it's because you are a fan of The Room, whether you were among the early aficionados, or turned onto it by The Disaster Artist. In any event, this is not The Room. It's neither that good, nor that bad. But does make for some laughs and it has some hysterically cryptic extras on the DVD. Get it if you're a collector of all things Tommy. Otherwise, you'll probably never get through the first episode.",1522454400,,681,4.636363636363637
8735472,4,B01633RGSG,It's like a Warhol film but without the deep character development and coherence.,1521504000,,81,5.3076923076923075
8735473,1,B01633RGSG,"If you've a seen a recent screening of ""The Room"" you've probably caught one of the episodes from this waste of time.  According to Wise, everyone is just doing this show for fun.  I know there are people out there who believe that Tommy directed ""The Room"" but according to Greg's book, it's clear that Sandy Schklair directed it and had a huge hand in the filming getting done. He thought it would never be released. The script was unfilmable and a lot of the dialogue was garbled English and needed to be cleaned up.  I think Tommy knew this and that's why he never gave anyone a copy, only doling out a few pages at a time with Sandy doctoring the script as it went along. In addition, Tommy had no experience in film and Sandy was the most experienced crew member. Based on his description of what Tommy asked him to do, he was the de facto director. He only left on the last day of filming when Tommy's love scenes were set to be filmed. According to Greg, this was preplanned and Tommy had advance notice of this. With ""The Neighbors"" you have your answer as to what would happen if someone didn't fill the role Sandy did.  It's a mess and not a good one. You can't hear it very well, all of the characters are talking over each other and it's of terrible video quality (I guess he didn't keep the cameras) and should've never been released. It's basically one long Tommy Wiseau underwear commercial. Tommy should really patch things up with Sandy because it's clear they are interesting collaborators, but I'm not sure if they could with Tommy now knowing what Sandy thinks of his material.",1514505600,4,1598,4.462328767123288
8735474,4,B01633RGSG,The room is one of my favorite awesomely bad movies to watch. This is 6 episodes that are like the room condensed down to a 20 dose of wtf did i just watch? It has to be watched to understand,1507420800,,191,3.8
8735475,3,B01633RGSG,"Terrible quality. Bad acting, bad script, bad audio quality, Tommy Wiseau is blatantly obviously just switching out wigs when he plays different characters and the characters have no depth. But it's TW so it's kinda funny.

The special features are definitely the best part of the purchase.",1505174400,3,290,5.170212765957447
8735476,1,B01633RGSG,"Dear gods, The Room worked as no one was really in on the joke, here they were trying for comedy and it just doesn't work.",1502928000,4,122,3.92
8735477,2,B01633RGSG,"Man, this was hard to watch. Indeed, we only made it through 2 episodes. Everybody shouts. Nobody has any skill at anything resembling TV production. The set was stupid and incomplete; the script was nonsense and probably nonexistent; the ""acting"" was just shrill screaming from the cast and the occasional but still too oft-repeated 'vot a day' from Wiseau; costumes were ill-fitting and ludicrous, consisting mostly of bikinis for the women; the cutaways were all exactly the same shot with the exact same repetitive musical diddling; the only really compelling performance came from the chicken. I mean, I *believed* the chicken.",1499644800,7,632,5.267326732673268
