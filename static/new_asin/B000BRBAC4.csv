8091393,4,B000BRBAC4,"These Passport DVD releases tend to get a bad rep because they rely on public domain footage, but just because film is free to use doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.

Every actor profile presented has a very healthy 23 minute length, and focuses exclusively on their film careers. Hardcore fans of any of these actors are not likely to learn anything new, but because there's such a variety any film fan is bound to know less about certain leading men than others, so you get a crash course on performers whose name you may recognize but you may know little about.

I rather like that most of the footage are from trailers because, firstly, it is fascinating to watch how certain movies were presented at the time they were released, and secondly, because it forces the documentary to examine careers on a film-by-film basis, which I personally enjoy in Hollywood biographies more than broad strokes and endless talk of their persona mixed with interchangeable accolades.

At the affordable price, you're basically getting what you pay for. Film fans looking for light entertainment and to-the-point career overviews of many actors who have few documentaries donated to them will be pleased.",1410566400,2,1190,4.969849246231155
8091394,2,B000BRBAC4,"This DVD set on the Leading Men, as well as the companion set on Leading Ladies, are done exactly the same, on the cheap.  Using public domain footage from movie trailers, old movies and tv shows and some ameatur footage taken of the more recent stars, the quality of this set is poor.  This is basically a DVD release of a VHS series of the 1990s called ""Hollywood Remembers,"" and using the exact same footage.  Photos, when used in this documentary, are filmed out of books or magazines...very poor quality all around. DO NOT expect A&E type Bios here.",1156291200,6,554,4.575757575757576
