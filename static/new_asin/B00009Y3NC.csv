1896694,5,B00009Y3NC,"If you just read a thumb nail sketch of this movie, it sounds like another in a long line of (take your pick) lightweight romantic comedies/fish-out-of-water/road movies.  And it's true, there's nothing terribly ground breaking in terms of plot here.  Nevertheless, it's worth your time.  Some of the things that make ""Jump Tomorrow"" special are as follows:
*the whimsical spirit of the screen play;
*the capricious joy with which the actors play their parts;
*vibrantly colored sets and cinematography; and
*director Joel Hopkins, who keeps this movie from taking itself too seriously.
The casting and performances in this movie deserve special mention.  Hipployte Girardot turns in an amusing performance as Gerard, frenetic friend of George, the film's protagonist.  Natalia Verbeke (the next Penelope Cruz?) is alluring and sweet as George's friend and love interest.  But my personal favorite is Tunde Adebimpe as George.  He plays the part with such hangdog sincerity, I couldn't help feeling exactly what he feels.  The word ""chemistry"" is overused, but these three definitely have it.  They play their parts so naturally, I forgot I was watching a movie.  There is zero sense of ""star-struck Hollywood"" in this film.  (Perhaps that stands to reason, since it's an in indie movie.)
By the way, when was the last time you saw a movie where the three main characters were Latina, French, and African American?  Kudos to the director for:  1)assembling this racially diverse cast; ans 2)doing it in a way that isn't overly self-aware,  or laden with attitude.
Note to parents:  ""Jump Tomorrow"" is rated PG.  Compared to much of what's out there, it's quite wholesome and free of offensive language.  It would be a good choice for your next family video night.
I saw ""Jump Tomorrow"" in Seattle in July, 2001 during its (extremely short) theatrical run.  On that same day, I saw ""Ghost World"" (which I also loved, but for different reasons).  I just couldn't get either film out of my mind; I thought for sure they would both go on to become art house hits.  We all know the success that ""Ghost World"" went on to achieve, but ""Jump Tomorrow"" somehow slipped through the cracks.  Ever since then, I've been hoping against hope that ""Jump Tomorrow"" would see a release on video.  Now, here's your chance to see what you've been missing!!",1056672000,16,2337,4.969072164948454

1896696,5,B00009Y3NC,"Here is a low-key romance that delivers despite, or perhaps because of its restraint. George, born in Nigeria, sets off to the airport to meet his arranged bride. We understand from his manner that George is a man who wants to do the right thing. He wants to honor his dead parents who dreamed of this marriage, and his uncle and the girl herself -- but he also wants to fall in love before signing away his life.
It turns out George got the wrong day but while at the airport he bumps into two people who will change his life -- Gerard, an over-enthusiastic Frenchman whose attempts to find amour always end in rejection and Alicia, a gorgeous Spanish girl about to leave on a trip to Canada with her pretentious British boyfriend.
Soon George and Gerard are in hot pursuit in a beat-up old Citroen, combing the byways of upstate New York for love.
I won't give away the plot except to say that I found the acting excellent, the writing excellent and the photography interesting throughout.
Often, say the word ""indie"" movie and my spirits sink. So many examples of that genre specialize in the lives of depressing weirdos. Here, for a pleasant change, are some normal free-spirits or people in the process of freeing their spirits that one can believe in.",1228348800,2,1257,4.591111111111111

There are not to many movies out on the market that will keep you entertained from beginning to the end, but this movie is one of them.

1896699,5,B00009Y3NC,"Jump Tomorrow opens cold, but is warmed over by the stylistic pathos and groovy music..  The director has said his goal was to create a world that implied alternate-reality but doesn't quite force it down our throats.  Aided by the protagonist's quirkish clumsiness and initial cubicle drone personality, the running Soundtrack and oddly retro at the modernist lounge designs, the movie succeeds at an extremely oblique sort of ""magic realism"".

As characters are introduced, interactions occur (in a great combination of slapstick, situational, and deadpan comedy), humanity is added to the film... characters whose singular flaws and stereotypes were embedded to the point of near caricature become sympathetic enough to recognize the human goop beneath.  The stylistic devices slide to the background, but are still pronounced enough to maintain that sly otherworldliness.

The resulting movie is most complete-feeling... by the end I had both Smiled and Laughed. Surreal warm fuzzy mellotronic cinema... the best romantic comedy I've seen since High Fidelity (where it succeeds, as with every other good Romantic Comedy, is in taking the cemented stereotypes of the genre and rearranging them to the point where the only recognizable traits are that it is both Romantic, and Comedic, but hardly resembles any other).",1122336000,4,1320,5.450980392156863

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

It's very rare these days to find a romantic comedy that is both romantic and funny, I was greatly satisfied with Jump Tomorroe. I remember seeing the short film Jorge by the same writer-director (Joel Hopkins) and it had the same actor who played Jorge (Tunde Adebimpe). All the actors were ejoyable and had great chemistry. The script is funny and often hilarious and the directing is quirky and cool. It's also rare to see and indie film that's PG, most are PG-13 or R, it's amazing. There is some language but only about three maybe four curse words used. Truly remarkable, a must see film. PS, if you can find the short film Jorge definitley see it as well.",1121817600,3,823,4.309677419354839
1896702,5,B00009Y3NC,"This is a very enjoyable ""girlie"" movie, but really guys listen up, if your girl friend wants to pop this DVD in: go for it.  Though the plot is a romantic, the characters bring to life a very fresh movie style and not only smart humor but funny humor.
Sorry theirs no nude bodies running around or Jerry Springer fights, but a very well thought out plot that is understandable and enjoyable.
It's about time some one can put out a decent movie that doesn't have anything to do with drugs, or uses the f word to start every conversation. This movie will bring a couple together, I'll put a dollar on it..  I really like this movie and wish it could be found in stores.  From a real dude~",1082592000,9,687,4.269230769230769
1896703,5,B00009Y3NC,"Gandolf is back and this time.. he's pissed. The best film since Ishtar. Pauly Shore brings a human quality to this whimsical Kirosawa epic. I laughed, I cried, I was paralyzed in fear- and that was just standing in the concession line. Watch it with your kids, your mailman, your ex-wife and the ex-best friend she's now married to. This movie IS for everyone. It spoke to me-kinda creepy- kept laughing and pointing.",1064620800,6,418,4.739726027397261
1896704,4,B00009Y3NC,"I caught the short movie ""Jorge"" a couple of years back on IFC, which spawned this full-length version. That movie was black and white, and had a different actress in the lead. Also brought over from the earlier film are the fantasy sequences in the style of Spanish language soap operas.
  Tunde Adebimpe reprises his role as George, a man whose appearance belies his mousy demeanor. Adebimpe plays George a little like Peter Sellers in ""Being There"", as a man who takes very little action, but instead allows the events of the story to happen to him. Unlike Chance the Gardener, however, George is not totally disconnected from society or reality. The plot is a fairly standard road movie type deal, with an interesting arranged marriage subplot involving George. The real attraction of the movie are the characters, their interactions. They are offbeat but quite genuine. You have Nigerians, Latinos, a Frenchman, an Englishman, but this isn't a movie that is drunk with its own multiculturalism. A lesser movie may have had these characters cleverly trying to sort out their cultural differences on their way to becoming politically correct and stereotype-free, but the movie is not about their cultural revelations, it's about their individual quests for love. However, during a brief nationalistic argument between the Englishman and the Frenchman, the latter says ""You have these 4 guys with the hair from Liverpool and you think you have the monopoly on 20th century culture.""
  It's this Frenchman, in fact, who steals the movie. Hippolyte Girardot plays Gerard with equal parts comedy and tragedy, a guy who clings to his idealization of love even when the reality of it constantly tramples him. (The license plate on his car reads AMOUR 1). Natalia Verbeke, the Argentinian actress who plays Alicia is also very good. The movie is very light, but not at all empty. Highly recommended.",1061251200,10,1895,5.044728434504792
