There are five DVDs  with over 10 hours of recording.  Some of the contents on the DVDs include the following:  Kenai River, King Season, Bears & Salmon, Juneau, Kachemak Bay, Soldotna, and Seldovia.",1414540800,,341,5.0

8272462,2,B00197XF8M,Ok it says it shows all this stuff on multiple DVD's but this is a rather poor documentary version. Almost grainy video. There's a single DVD version that's gotta be better than this.,1261008000,3,183,4.575757575757576
