6201672,3,B00HRYH67M,"While I am very grateful to have a legitimate Ultimate Warrior DVD set & do not want to be negative, I do wish they would have not put so many jobber matches on this set. They could have put more from WCCW  & UWF I would think. I thought the Blu-Ray exclusives should be on the main DVD release and save the jobber matches for the Blu-Ray if they needed inclusion. Many other matches that were entertaining with the Warrior were left off this set in favor of these jobber matches, but I will buy this set and enjoy it still. Just wanted to voice how in my opinion this set could have been far better.",1393200000,13,600,4.172413793103448

6201723,2,B00HRYH67M,"This title is missing far too much warrior content to be classed as the ultimate collection.  A lot of his matches are only shown in highlights or bits and pieces.  Warrior himself at the end says that ""this should satisfy your warrior fix for now"" well i'm sorry to say it doesn't!  I'm a huge Warrior fan, and I wasn't satisfied with this at all.  It's missing many of his early-days matches with 'unknowns'.  It's missing one major match with Rick Rude, definitely a Andrew the Giant one missing here, not to mention where he lost his belt with Sgt. Slaughter, actually it's missing a lot of matches with Slaughter including the cage match.  Moving further down the timeline, his entire feud with Papa Shango is missing as well as the matches.  Some of his Brother Love interviews are also missing, especially the touching one where holds a little girl.

All the Warrior off ring appearances are totally missing, he did sometimes make tv show appearances which are on youtube, but you'll find nothing here.  Personally I would've liked to see some childhood photos, learn more about his personal life and family, maybe see pictures of his wife and children and get to know him more outside of the ring, but you get nothing here!

Now for the biggest problem and that comes down to his interview and narration.  Now I understand that during the time of making this dvd/blu ray he had made peace with Vince and he probably wouldn't want anymore aggravation but this interview far too safe!  He doesn't answer to any of the accusations made against him in the Self-Destruction dvd, he doesn't talk about the real reason why he left numerous times and came back, he doesn't talk about his disagreements with Vince or give his side of the story to any of the allegations made against him.

On the whole this is a disappointing release, but since it's all we have, I guess i'll have to settle with it.",1447804800,2,1898,4.629850746268657

I immediately searched for a collection of his greatest matches and the Ultimate Collection did not disappoint. I grew up watching hogan in his prime and i loved it, but for some reason, i never saw any of the Ultimate Warrior's matches. I was thrilled to see the Hogan Vs. Warrior fight in this collection and it was great. This collection even shows the beginning of the Undertaker and Triple H's careers! I enjoyed every minute of it, especially the Macho Man Vs. Ultimate Warrior  retirement match!
I HIGHLY recommend this collection to any wrestling fan.",1443830400,2,734,4.603053435114504

6201741,5,B00HRYH67M,"Great Memories from a golden era of wrestling. I for one learnt a lot more about Ultimate Warrior from watching this DVD on how he got into the business, teaming up with Sting as the Blade Runners in the early part of their careers. I like how the Warrior tells the story leading into each segment and is very complimentary to his fellow wrestlers, not just the big names like Macho Man & Hogan, but the many wrestlers (known as jobbers) who took many bumps, bruises and losses to help lift the image of the Ultimate Warrior who was at the time like a tornado. This is illustrated throughout the DVD in most of his matches and there are many highlights. I loved the commentary from the Brain Bobby Heenan and also later Jesse Ventura, classic stuff. As for the matches the earlier part of the DVD was more of a learning experience about the Warrior but once he moved to the WWF his persona skyrocketed. Wrestlemania 6 against Hogan had such great hype and was a great match is just one of the many highlights as was his feud with Randy Macho Man Savage ending in a classic encounter at Wrestlemania 7. The match prior to this, also against Randy, I had not previously seen was a cage match and was highly entertaining. They later teamed up as the Ultimate Maniacs, some good promos here. There are many more great matches, promos and vignettes. Brought back a lot of memories and if you were a fan of the Ultimate Warrior as many were than this is a disc well worth owning.",1431561600,,1473,4.419117647058823

6201746,5,B00HRYH67M,"Ya know, this was a purchase I had been meaning to make since Warrior passed on last year. And now that I have, and the Blu-Ray at that, it was beyond a doubt well worth it.  I had so much fun watching Warrior do his thing, especially since I actually didn't watch pro wrestling growing up other than shows like the original American Gladiators.  And admittedly? I always kind of looked down my nose at those people who liked MMA and pro wrestling and especially boxing.

But Warrior's death last year, and the outpouring of reaction from all corners of the folks I follow online, was instrumental in making me a fan of WWE.  Not necessarily the current talent, mind you (I objectively think they're awful, with the exception of Paul Heyman's amazing promos), but I really liked almost everything in this collection!  Now that I got this and enjoyed this, I am definitely going to get the new Always Believe set, on Blu-Ray of course, and I can NOT wait to have that in my hot little hands.  Thank you Warrior.  I had so much fun watching your set, and I am glad there's more to come, though you are not here to see it.

Before I give you a description of what's on the Blu-Ray set (according to BluRay.com), I wanted to give you my objective thoughts on some things.

Hogan: Actually I like what those two did in the ring, and I am sad that Eric Bischoff didn't want to do more with Warrior and Hollywood Hulk Hogan. That angle would have been really fun to see more of.

Andre: I know many people look down on the latter Andre matches with the likes of The Ultimate Warrior for many reasons, but actually I liked what I saw.  Probably good that they didn't include many of Andre / Warrior's matches here from what I hear though.

Randy Savage: I only knew of Macho Man Randy Savage for his Slim Jim ads (one of which was proudly placed in my elementary school cafeteria for whatever silly reason), but objectively?  Of the matches I saw on this set, and those are the only matches I've really seen so far, while I understand trying to paint the Warrior in the best light possible, it kind of doesn't reflect very well on Macho Man (nor on Macho Man's announcing, which is quite terrible). I guess if you grew up watching Macho Man do his thing you might feel differently, but because I didn't, I don't really see the appeal of enjoying watching a heel unless you enjoy watching a heel manager doing his thing like Paul Heyman or Captain Lou Albano (speaking of, why hasn't the WWE done a ""Best of Captain Lou Albano"" DVD / Blu-Ray set of JUST the best Captain Lou moments yet?).

WWE / WWF being conflated: Um. Vince. Real talk here, but revisionist history in almost any instance is totally uncool. I can totally understand in the case of one Chris Benoit, as I'd love to see him wiped from the history books because of what heinous acts he did, but come on, people know that your thing was once called the WWF (and I actually thought it was funny that there was another WWF to confuse some folks). Why are you making people refer to the WWF days as ""WWE""?  Is that a kayfabe name or something?  Also, why are you blurring out references to the WWF in some instances, but not others? I'd dearly love to know these things.

Rick Rude: Um... I don't really think that character went much of anywhere.

Ted DiBiase (aka The Million Dollar Man): Real talk, for the longest time I conflated his MDM character with the Six Million Dollar Man and thought they were the same thing.

As far as the audiovisual quality goes: For live action footage from that era, that looked and sounded surprisingly good. Great remastering job WWE, and I hope to see more of that on the upcoming Always Believe set!

If the WWE understood marketing, he would have been a superstar for an even longer period.  There were some repetitive scenes with reversals in fortune that could be anticipated long before they happened.  No full and honest discussion of bodybuilding drugs. The reference to Kerry von Erich was much too brief, as were several others.  The Rick Rude scene brought back memories.",1425513600,,507,5.134146341463414

Yeah, he is no Buddy Rogers.  But he worked a ring well for the skills he had.  He was in a lot of really cool matches and long ones too.  Good obscure match to see this is in his match with Rude when he won the IC title back at the second Summerslam.  Warrior is better than he gets credit for.",1425340800,,462,4.0777777777777775

This collection captures only one part of the many that he possessed during his tenured in the ring, his matches on the Independents, WWF, and WCW.  But I feel that the story was incomplete, as told by the Warrior himself on the program, it was just scratching the surface, which in fact did, at the time of this title release, WrestleMania 30 was happening that weekend, he was inducted into the WWE hall of fame that very same day, and was appearing on the next Monday night Raw the next day. It was a Warrior weekend, sort of. But sadly, the very night after the taping of Monday Night Raw, he died of a massive heart attack :( This collection constitutes, as his only authorized story endorsed by him. I know that later on, the WWE paid tribute to him, by doing a definitive version of it, by adding commentaries from the McMahons and appearances from friends and wrestlers that knew him, hopefully will see release at some point as the part of his story. In all, it was bitter sweet finally seeing my childhood hero getting the respect and recognition that he deserves for so many years of abandonment. Pick it up if you are a fan, or love wrestling, and you'll see who was, is and forever be... THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR! Music hits!",1419897600,2,1401,4.47265625

6201966,5,B00HRYH67M,"So after almost two decades of acrimony between Warrior and the WWE, broken bridges were mended and he was finally welcomed back to the company. First came the 2K14 video game and later in April 2014 the blu ray, the hall of fame induction & his final public appearances at WMXXX and Raw. The timing of his death was erie, almost as if once he had finally got the recognition he deserved and the right story had been told his mission was over; It was time to load the spaceship with the rocket fuel and return to parts unknown.

After the smear campaign 'Self Destruction' DVD of 2005, a true career retrospective that did UW justice was long overdue and 'The Ultimate Collection' does just that. What we've got here is about 30 matches, all remastered looking much better than they do on youtube, interspersed with a new interview with Warrior filmed at his home in January of this year as he gives introductions to certain matches or reminisces about other legends such as Macho or Andre. All of UW's greatest matches are here and with a running time of over eight hours you will not be left unsatisfied.

My only gripes were that they could have included a few more promos (They were a big part of what defined UW, I think there are only about 5-6 in total throughout) and that some noteworthy matches are strangely absent;- Rude v Warrior (WMV), Losing the belt to Sgt Slaughter, The Papa Shango feud, Macho v Warrior SS 92, more of his 1996 matches and the admittedly crap yet still iconic WCW Hogan rematch etc etc. It would be nice to see a volume 2 that had this stuff & the HOF speech perhaps narrated by Dana Warrior?

Overall this is an Awesome collection packed with some of the greatest wrestling matches of all time. Ultimate Warrior was a true wresting legend and icon;- an absolute beast in the ring, underrated in his in-ring abilities and with more charisma and intensity in his little finger than half of the current WWE roster. Rest in Power ULTIMATE WAARRYAAARRRR!!!!!!",1399248000,5,1990,4.584269662921348

6201968,5,B00HRYH67M,"I still remember the late 80's when WWF wrestling was huge and I watched it for a few years.  One night this super-INTENSE guy with face paint came sprinting out with an energy level that I had never seen before and I immediately realized that this guy was awesome!  For several years I followed the Ultimate Warrior and unfortunately I grew up and stopped following him and pro wrestling and didn't think about it for more than 20 years.  A few weeks ago I saw that he had passed away and suddenly I realized that I had forgotten about the Warrior.  I ordered this DVD and it is outstanding with many great matches that I saw long ago.  He also offers commentary in a recent interview before each of the matches.  It has brought back many memories of a wonderful time in my life and one of the most entertaining performers that I have seen.  After seeing his hall of fame ceremony I see what a wonderful, sincere and caring man this was and I am very glad that I was a Ultimate Warrior fan.  Thanks for the memories and R.I.P.

6201980,5,B00HRYH67M,"I indented to purchase this blu-ray set the same day it came out but never got a chance.  A week later still not purchased and heard some shocking news, hoping it was a hoax, but course it was not.  After feeling really depressed I felt it would to painful watching this set with him gone.  The I realized dead or alive nothing ever will take these great childhood memories away from me.  This Blu-ray set has it all, hosted by Warrior himself, he talks about his early life all the way to the latter years.  The selection of matches are excellent started from his younger days with Sting till his last stint in the business.  What a time he chose back to his WWE family, Thanks for all the memories, the timing of your death is so surreal.

6201982,5,B00HRYH67M,"If you're here reading this review then I'm sure you're familiar with this phenom's body of work, so I'll keep this short and sweet. This is an amazing turn around by the WWE from their previously slanderous 'The Self Destruction of The Ultimate Warrior' dvd from 2005. Warrior here gets to tell his own side of the story & it's a good one. He's a highly intelligent, erudite & thoughtful speaker & once his face hits the screen & he greets you you'll sadly realize what a shock it is that he's gone. The matches on hand are some of the biggest & best of the Federation Years & the 25 include his feud with 'Ravishing' Rick Rude for the Intercontinental Belt, the title for title 'Ultimate Challenge' against Hogan at WrestleMania VI and his epic ""career on the line"" match against Randy Savage at WrestleMania VII. Some matches from bigger cards were left off that I expected to see, mainly 'The Match Made In Hell' from Summer Slam '91, the Heavyweight Championship steel cage match from Summer Slam '90 against Rude, his WrestleMania V Intercontinental Championship loss to Rude & his Summer Slam 1992 Face vs. Face match against 'Macho Man' Randy Savage for the Heavyweight title. This leads me to think that these matches and lesser ones (likes his WrestleMania IV match against Hercules) will pad out the running time on a hopefully second set of discs.",1398643200,3,1359,4.690376569037657
6201983,5,B00HRYH67M,"The warrior runs wild on this Blu Ray set. This video serves a a gripping tribute to the man known as Warrior. It is almost a Greek tragedy that Warrior would pass away just one week after this video was released, and also just hours after a remarkable appearance on Monday Night Raw.

I am so glad this video was released and that Warrior provided insight. The matches speak for themselves. If you are a wrestling fan from late 80's-early 90's you know that Warrior was one of a kind. The video quality on this Blu-Ray is excellent and WWE has packed this set with many great Warrior matches and moments. Definitely check this out and pay tribute to a great personality and wrestler. Ultimate Warrior will run wild forever!!",1397952000,,725,4.576923076923077
6201984,5,B00HRYH67M,"I never thought I'd see the day I would ever be doing a review on an Ultimate Warrior DVD. The reason being simply because I never cared for him. I tried to get into him but I never saw the spark and after hearing and reading about so many despicable things Warrior did behind the scenes during his 90s run in the WWF, it made me dislike him even more.

Then on Wrestlemania 30 week, I saw the commercials for his DVD and saw that he was doing all the talking on this DVD. Somewhat interested in hearing what he had to say about his WWF tenure since his 1996 departure, I felt compelled to buy the DVD. After hearing his awe-inspiring Hall of Fame speech, I felt that with him burying the hatchet, I needed to give him a chance. So I brought his DVD and I was actually very impressed with it!

This collection tells the story of Ultimate Warrior, told by Warrior himself! We start with opening words from Warrior before we load the spaceship with the rocket fuel and shoot off into parts unknown! From there on out in this 5+ hour DVD, the viewer is treated to Warrior's best matches and moments. From his early days as Blade Runner Rock to his ascension as the beloved Ultimate Warrior, Warrior tells the story in his own words and holds back on nothing, which should tell you how far he and McMahon have come and forgiven each other.

This DVD offers up only the best Ultimate Warrior matches, including his SummerSlam match with Rick Rude, his notorious Wrestlemania 6 title unification match with Hulk Hogan. his retirement match with Randy Savage, his debut in WCW and more! One of my favorite Ultimate Warrior moments was when Jake Roberts put Warrior through a series of tests to prepare to meet The Undertaker on the dark side which included being locked in a casket, being buried, and walking through a room of snakes. Unfortunately those moments didn't make it on this set but can probably be found on Youtube.

Overall, this is an astonishing DVD set that properly delves into the career of Ultimate Warrior. It also represents forgiveness. After Warrior left WWF in 1996 on a bad note and the release of the mockery Self-Destruction of Ultimate Warrior DVD, many thought we'd never see Ultimate Warrior or another Ultimate Warrior DVD in WWE again. But Warrior and McMahon managed to bury the hatchet and have this amazing set be released. After the shocking death of Warrior, this DVD now and forever serves as a tribute to one of the greatest to ever step inside of a WWF ring; the legend that is Ultimate Warrior!

  *RIP Ultimate Warrior*",1397865600,5,2554,4.55119825708061
6201985,5,B00HRYH67M,"I have nothing but good things to say about this blu-ray, it is simply awesome. Whether you're a fan of the Warrior, or just a fan of wrestling, you gotta get this collection. However it did take me a while to watch the whole 8 to 9 hrs of content, due to emotions bubbling up during viewing. I got this collection the day before Warrior's passing, and had only watched the first hour that first day. Having waited so long for this sort of collection on the Warrior to be released, I wanted to savor it. I would also like to retell my history of being one of those first little warriors. I'll try to be brief, because there are so many fond memories of Warrior that it would take forever to write them all. The Ultimate Warrior debuted on my fifth birthday 1987, and I was pulled into the wilds of the Warrior from the start. My older brother loved Hogan, but I was not so interested, and being new to watching wrestling at the time, I was just blown away by the Warrior's charisma. I grew up lower class, so I wasn't able to watch all of Warrior's matches on pay per view, I had to wait for the Coliseum video release to arrive in the video store. I would save my allowances up to buy anything with Warrior's visage. I remember those Warrior action figures were hard to get when I was a kid. First of all they were more rare than the other figures, but they also sold out fast. I had to talk to the stock guy at the Toys R Us to find out when they would be putting out the newer stuff, which was Friday night after closing, and I would have to show up early Saturday morning. So I did, and it worked. Those figures are not nearly as great as the newest Mattel releases (which I really hope continue), they were simple. But at that age, they were prized to me, and going home with one in hand was absolute spendor. The first and only time I ever got to see Warrior live, was at the Frank Erwin Center. It was early 1990. He battled Haku. I wasn't sitting as close to the ring as I would have liked, but I had my face painted with some leftover Halloween makeup, and I was never so excited in my life to see anything. Pretty sure I'll never be that excited about anything else for the rest of my life! I had to wait to near the end of the show before seeing him because he was a main eventer at that point. But when Haku came to the ring I knew who was next. When that music hit I went nuts. The entire match, I never sat down or stopped chanting ""WARRIOR! WARRIOR!"" My older brother kept telling me to sit down, but there was no way. I didn't want to waste such a rare, and supremely awesome moment in my life. The match was maybe ten minutes long I'd say. I loved how Warrior would react in the ring to cheers. The more you would cheer the more he would fight back against his opponent. Hogan did that also, but not to quite the same extent. Warrior seemed to reward crowds cheering more than any other performer, and that level of interaction and response is very rare. The day after I could barely speak, but it was so worth it. I'll also never forget the bet I had with my brother and a bunch other kids that the Warrior would beat Hogan at Wrestlemania 6. The buildup for WM6 was so great. The prospect of these two in a matchup was unlike any other match at the time, or since. I'd say it was on the level of two undefeated teams playing in the Super Bowl. It was a big effin deal! From the '90 Royal Rumble to WM. Hogan and Warrior were doing the best work of their careers. Those kids were so sure Hogan would win. The day after WM6, I forbid anyone telling me who won because I had to wait for the video release. Some of those kids tried to use my ignorance to their advantage, telling me Hogan won to force me to pay up. No bet would be settled until I saw it for myself. The day my bro and I got to watch the WM6 video, we actually watched the whole thing, and didn't just skip to the end. The Warrior-Hogan match was the best I'd seen from both competitors. (I just noticed recently watching that match, that at the end the ref screwed up and handed Warrior both belts, and Warrior takes that sweet yellow IC belt, shoving the ref back still holding the world championship belt. That was pretty damn funny. Ref almost ruined the end of the match, and I bet Warrior and Terry were glaring at the poor guy, who probably felt five inches tall). When Warrior won the match I was electric with joy. Sadly, none of those kids would pay up. Sore losers. It didn't matter though. Winning is enough. After Warrior's win at WM6 the WWF seemed to try to make him more like Hogan, making his hair blonde and such. That bothered me because the darker Warrior was way better. I loved Warrior's year-long reign as champ, until The Macho King (not Man at that point) cost him the belt. But their rivalry was the single best rivalry I would ever see in all the years I would watch wrestling. When Warrior left at the end of 1991, I was very upset. Wondering what happened. People started saying that he died. I didn't believe that for a second. When I got to see Wrestlemania 8, I had no idea what was waiting at the very end. When Hogan's being piled on, then Warrior's music kicked up, I was in shock... at first. Blown away, I starting screaming so loud in my room that my parents thought something was wrong. I watched that WM8 ending over and and over. Never has there ever been a crowd that loud in my years of watching wrestling. Never. The Warrior would leave again. The second time was not as heartbreaking. But I never really gave up on the Warrior's return. He would return in 96, and that was brief. Still I was extremely excited about it while it lasted. He would return once more in WCW, which was strange for me. WCW was not a very well organized machine, and they really ruined alot of great wrestlers. Even though, I was still blown away by the return, just not as much as in 92. After that, it seemed the Warrior was no longer interested in being in the wrestling biz. I can't blame him. I wasn't mad about it or anything, I just loved the Warrior, his energy, his personality was engrossing and extremely engaging. He inspired me, as I'm sure he did countless others. He was responsible for a lot great memories in my childhood, when good memories for me were fewer than I would have liked. I'll never forget how hilarious it was to watch ring announcers and referees have to bail out of the ring because the speed, energy, and wild fury Warrior carried to the ring. I still laugh at how fast Howard Finkel had to get out of the way of Warrior in his Summerslam IC match with Honkey Tonk Man. This blu-ray features a match in Japan between Warrior and Sgt. Slaughter, in which Warrior wails on Slaughter, throwing him around in the crowd. Warrior was like Godzilla on rampage. I laughed so hard at the craziness of it all. Just amazing. Because of him I would push harder in everything I did. Anything athletic, from football, to baseball, to working out, to track and field days, to whatever there was that would test my mettle in life and sport. I had the Warrior in my mind. No challenge was too great. I could overcome long or impossible odds, and even if I couldn't win, I still wouldn't quit. Since 1998, I had longed to see the Warrior's return. His return match, in Spain I think it was, was not really what I had in mind, knowing that it was a one shot. As the Warrior man said, I always believed. The last couple years saw releases of Ultimate Warrior figures made by Mattel, and all based on the different moments and looks from Warrior's career. I really hope they continue those, they're so supremely sweet. I have them all. Then last year Warrior was in the promotion for the newest WWE game, which was both hilarious and pure Warrior wildness. I knew the Warrior was returning, but didn't know the capacity. I didn't care. Just to feel that electricity again was more than enough. The HOF speech was to be the beginning. The dvd/blu-ray was just to set the record straight. I never believed the detractors and slander of Warrior, and I said as much in my review of The Self Destruction dvd. It was so surreal to see him on RAW, I was just floored. It was made very bittersweet after the day that followed. Hearing and seeing the news of his death just didn't seem real. It felt like someone tied a ten pound weight to my heart. Utter shock. I couldn't even speak or think right for the rest of that day. A week later, I watched the tribute to the Warrior on RAW, and I couldn't hold back the tears. The Warrior man gave so much for his fans, and wrestling fans in general.

6201988,5,B00HRYH67M,"The Ultimate Warrior holds a special place in my heart. I was four years old, sitting in front of the t.v. and flipping through the six channels we had. I stumbled across a man rippling with muscles, his face painted in a bright and color mask, running down to the ring and shaking the ropes with all his strength. Wham, bam and 5 minutes later, The Ultimate Warrior had destroyed some ""Ham and Egger"" (shout-out to Bobby Heenan) and had captivated my young mind. I never saw WWE on my television screen again until we got cable and Stone Cold Steve Austin made me a wrestling fan for life. However, I point to the moment of seeing Warrior blaze arcross the t.v. in 1991 planted the seeds for me to become the massive pro wrestling fan I am today.

A decade ago, WWE released a dvd entitled ""The Self-Destruction of The Ultimate Warrior"". The dvd, which I watched numerous times, painted Warrior as an egotistcal jerk that couldn't wrestle to save his life and whos promos were nonsensical garbage. To this day, that dvd is considered to be hack-job to Warrior's legacy and was a huge factor in Warrior repeatedly declining an invitation to join the WWE Hall of Fame (as he states in this dvd and in his HOF acceptance speech). Warrior may have been slightly off his rocker (look up his lectures and Youtube shoots if you don't believe me) he was a hugely popular superstar during WWE's first ""boom"" period and, at one point, rivaled Hulk Hogan as the most popular  superstar in the company.

They say time heals all wounds and that appeared to be the case with Warrior and WWE mending the fences and releasing this dvd set to properly pay tribute to the man from Parts Unknown. Warrior sat down and recorded an interview specifically for this dvd set. There's typically an interview before each match/promo/segment, unless we get a bunch of similar matches lumped together (this happens twice on the dvd). Much to my surprise, Warrior was a very insightful and lucid speaker. He's much more composed and intelligent than his promos may lead you to believe! Throughout these interview segments, Warrior seems to hold nothing back and I believe is being 100% honest with his thoughts. You may learn things you didn't know about the man (he wrote down what he was going to say in his promos, I found that interesting) and you'll definitely be hooked on what Warrior has to say. It's a shame that there aren't MORE of these interview segments, but what is here is very informative and it's great to hear Warrior put his spin on the same topics WWE tried to bury in ""Self Destruction"".

As far as the matches go, there's a good mix between Warrior's best-known clashes and hidden gems. Some have complained about the the inclusion of so many ""squash"" matches. I personally feel those matches are needed to show how Warrior built himself up and established a connection with the fans. Those matches defintely aren't classics, but watching this dvd in the mindset of a 1980's WWE fan helps. Warrior will never be known as an amazining wrestler, but he was far better than he gets credit for, and his energy and intensity helped add layers to most Warrior matches. If you buy this set expecting to see numerous 4-5 * matches, you'll be disappointed. Warrior had exactly  four great matches, three of which are on this set (vs Rick Rude @ Summerslam, vs Hogan @ WM VI and vs Savage @ WM VII). Remember when I said ""hiddem gems"" though? This set has more than a few. Both the other matches with Randy Savage (especially the steel cage match) are great matches, as the WWE championship matches with Ted DiBiase and the match vs The Undertaker. There's also several memorable Warrior promos and segments, including a hysterical, at least by modern standards, moment where Taker locks him in a coffin and fills it with water.

Sadly, this dvd collection will also serve as a memorial for The Ultimate Warrior, who passed away just a week after its release. It's fortunate then that Warrior and WWE were able to give us this dvd set before it was too late. This dvd is a terrific summary/capstone/tribute to the man who captured the hearts and minds of ""little Warriors"" everywhere. If you're a fan of The Ultimate Warrior, loved late 1980's WWE, or simply a wrestling fan in general, this dvd needs to be on your shelves. RIP Warrior.

This is self-evident with both Warrior and Hogan, and Stonecold Steve Austin's knees are heavily padded up, to allow him to walk.

I loved Ted DiBiase 'The Million Dollar Man', he only quit the ring because one more bad 'bump and he'd be paralyzed from the neck down.

6202009,5,B00HRYH67M,"Honor his memory, relive his moments with happiness. Thank you for all the happy memories. Rest In Peace, Ultimate Warrior.

Growing up in my early teens, I couldn't find anything that I could relate with. I couldn't relate to any type of music - I didn't listen to the radio, and there wasn't much on TV at the time. Besides following basketball and Magic Johnson, I could not find anything in popular entertainment that would really struck a nerve. Growing up awkward, not a jock, not rich, not a brainiac(maybe a few of you can relate), there wasn't much that could bring out the inner me.

Then one day on a Saturday night, while channel surfing, I perchance came upon a peculiar tune. A thunderous bass, some kickin' percussion, and a wicked guitar riff - What was this?? Then out of nowhere shot out a man - no, it was more than a man. It was a spirit, an energy, a force - it was THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR! I would never forget that moment which changed my life, which gave something that I could attach myself to and find meaning within these forces called ""growing up.""

Here I was, a shy, taciturn, introverted boy. No way to express myself, no outlet to channel my thoughts, no medium to funnel my energy. Yet when I heard that music, and saw this embodiment of energy zipping through the crowd, jumping up the stairs, shaking the ropes, rumbling the ring, I finally found my meaning of existence, and that all is right with the world. Say what you will about the man - if he took steroids, if he was a jerk to the other wrestlers, if he was anarchistic to The Man(Vince McMahon & the WWF). When you're a kid, and you witnessed The Ultimate Warrior, you don't think of any of that, and it didn't matter. It didn't matter if we couldn't really understand his interviews and monologues. More than the man, The Ultimate Warrior was a symbol, he was a beacon for those of us who were awkward, who were confused, who were shunned, who were laughed upon, who were lost. He was that guiding light for our childhood, that no matter how bad our day was, our week, our family, our school, our personal life. For those 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, when you were in the world of the Warrior, you were realized, you were recognized, you were understood. More than a man, The Ultimate Warrior was the personification of our thoughts, the manifestation of our feelings. The Ultimate Warrior was the culmination of us - he was the ultimate culmination of my childhood, he was the culmination of me.

So once again, thank you, Warrior. More than the matches, more than the show, like Guns N' Roses afterwards, like the song ""Eighteen"" by Alice Cooper, you allowed me to find my way, you allowed me to grow up, you allowed me to understand myself, you allowed me to be me. And I was all right after all.

Your life has passed, but your energy remains in all of us who had the honor and the pleasure to witness your being. The Ultimate Warrior lives on in all of us.

Thank you.",1397001600,42,2970,4.440366972477064

6202012,4,B00HRYH67M,"After WWE disgraced Warrior on a previous dvd, Warrior returns but not to talk about that dvd. At the start of the dvd he seems like a good guy & well spoken. However, I disagree with him when he said that he has tons of great matches in the vault. This set is everything you want of the Warrior-his best known matches, jobber matches, but too many repeat opponents. I would have prefered seeing him wrestle the bigger guys at the time like Haku, Earthquake, or Papa Shango. Hell his feud with Shango isn't even metioned & most of his return in 92 is ignored expect his run with Macho Man as the Ultimate Maniacs. In the end he says there could be another dvd release but I highly doubt it even though this dvd will sell well.

Overall, a exhausting dvd over the Warrior with his insight in between matches, the promos leading to matches, & the matches itself. The only real draw back to the set is the same opponent are constantly repeated & no matches from his comeback in 92 like Shango. If you're a Warrior fan, you'll love it. If not & love old school WWE, then you'll love it. If you're just curious to learn more about him, then you'll love it. I enjoyed the set but don't expect too many quality matches.",1396656000,3,1212,4.315789473684211
6202013,4,B00HRYH67M,"He's one of the most controversial wrestlers in the history for his actions in & outside of the wrestling ring to the point where WWE released a DVD set close to a decade ago telling THEIR side of the story while attempting to embarrass & bury him as a person & his wrestling career but ""time heals all wounds"" with this man finally being able to tell his own story while providing various matches of his career ranging from his most famous matches to rare encounters along with often forgotten about moments in the career of the Ultimate Warrior.  Warrior himself providing comments in between each match on various subjects & career points throughout his career including starting out, working in World Class, his championship runs, elements of his character, various opponents, his famous entrance, importance of ""jobbers"" to his career, his returns to WWE, and WCW while also seeing moments such as confronting Andre on The Brother Love Show, three promos including his infamous ""crash the plane"" promo for his WrestleMania VI match, the end of The Brother Love Show, appearance on The Funeral Parlor, face to face interviews with Randy Savage, confrontation with Goldust, receiving a gift from Jerry Lawler, and two of his promos from WCW including the debut coming face to face with Hollywood Hogan.

Matches Include:
Blade Runners vs. Perry Jackson & Shawn O'Reilly - This was pretty much just a dominate power showcase of the future Ultimate Warrior & Sting at the start of their careers but more significant based off how these men started their careers together & paralleled each other in different companies all the way to both men being the World Champion at the same time only four years later.
""Universal Wrestling Federation' Apr. '86

vs. Chris Adams - Percy Pringle III caused a distraction in the beginning allowing Warrior to work over the throat area using the ring ropes various times & showcasing his power catching Adams in mid-air while Adams was able to recover using a superkick on more than one occasion along with a piledriver.  This match was pretty short & sweet with the only thing really noteworthy was the controversial finish.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Aug. '86

vs. Barry Horowitz - Warrior showcased his superior power advantage with when either delivering or receiving offense only to have Barry keep bouncing off him to the point where Barry was able to get an advantage taking advantage of Warrior's own mistiming.  This was pretty much a dominate enhancement match.
""Wrestling Challenge"" Nov. '87

vs. Steve Lombardi - This was a match where Warrior not only showcased his dominance through his power offense such as a shoulderblock & clotheslines & a bearhug but also his ability to keep using his opponents momentum against him multiple times as well.
""Superstars"" Nov. '87

vs. Harley Race - Warrior started out very dominate with Race's offense having no effect & kept being knocked to the outside to the point where he ended up sprawled out all over the ringside steps after being thrown so hard into the corner before Race was able to use Warrior's momentum against him while delivering some hard hitting moves such as a piledriver & headbutts as Race was able to get more offense in on Warrior than anyone had previously had up to this point.
Mar. '88

Weasel Suit Match vs. Bobby Heenan - Heenan kept trying to run away & avoid Warrior before eventually getting caught before using tactics that did show it's effects on Warrior in a match that was pretty short & served it's purpose.
July '88

vs. Intercontinental Champion Honky Tonk Man - All I can say on this one is don't blink because you'll miss the longest Intercontinental Title reign end in seconds.
SummerSlam '88
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; History Of Intercontinental Championship; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden]

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Honky Tonk Man - Warrior took the attack to Honky right away & even took care of Jimmy Hart at ringside before a mistiming allowed Honky to take advantage with both him & Hart using whatever they could get their hands on to work over Warrior weather is was weapons at ringside or the ring ropes to choke him down causing Warrior to use their own tactics against them.
Dec. '88

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Randy Savage - A year before ""The Ultimate Challenge"" with Hulk Hogan, Warrior met Savage under the same conditions where both championships were on the line in the same match.  Warrior showed he had the power advantage so Savage outsmarted Warrior to take advantage working over Warrior in & outside of the ring working over the throat area while executing both a grounded & aerial assault as both men continued to trade momentum throughout the contest with another important figure looking on at ringside.  This comes off now as a teaser or preview of their series of matches they would have two years later but it was still a good quality match as many have said that Savage was Warrior's greatest opponent & that can't be denied as Savage gave us a better match with Warrior than anyone else did up to this point in time.
Feb. '89

vs. Intercontinental Champion Rick Rude - The rematch months after their controversial WrestleMania encounter with Warrior dominating with his power offense such as pressing Rude over top rope onto the floor & just dropping Rude onto his butt on the mat while giving Rude a taste of his own medicine as far his taunts before Rude attempted to take away the power by heavily working over his back as both men traded momentum with both men trying to one up the other at times including executing different styles of piledrivers against each other. Rude was one of the men who was able to work with & get the best out of Warrior's one dimensional power style giving Warrior one of the best in-ring quality matches here.
SummerSlam '89
[History Of Intercontinental Championship]

vs. Bob Bradley - You typical Ultimate Warrior squash match that had some comedic moments at the start & after the match.
""Prime Time Wrestling"" Sept. '89

vs. Brian Costello - Another Warrior squash match that would probably be more memorable for what he did to him after than during the match.
""Prime Time Wrestling"" Dec. '89

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - This was short (and I'm putting that lightly) as Andre decided to mock Warrior & payed for it.
""Madison Square Garden"" Oct. '89

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Andre The Giant - Andre came after Warrior right away attempting to take the breathe away by either choke him out in various ways or stretching him using anything to his advantage while Warrior continued to use his power to attempt to knock Andre down & beat Andre at his own game using some of his own offense against him while taking advantage of any situation to work his favor.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Nov. '89

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Mr. Perfect - Warrior showcased his superior strength advantage right from the start powering Perfect outside of the ring on various ways whenever he wasn't dragging him around in the ring before a miscalculation on Warrior's part allowed Perfect to work over the midsection with various strikes & dropping his weight on it while also attempting to keep him grounded.
""Madison Square Garden"" Mar. '90

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line. Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them. Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic even down the commentary where Monsoon & Ventura didn't have a ""good guy vs. bad guy"" guideline to follow as the fans being split right down the middle as well.
Wrestlemania VI
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; History Of The WWE Championship]

WWE Championship Match vs. Ted DiBiase - This was a rare title defense in that it happened during WWE's tour of Japan & Dibiase didn't have Virgil in his corner with Dibiase bringing the attack to Warrior first only for Warrior to counter back shoving off Dibiase's offense & using his power advantage only for Dibiase to use Warrior's momentum against him to regain the advantage using some impactful offense of his own.
""Wrestling Summit"" Apr. '90

WWE Championship Match vs. Rick Rude - Warrior came out very aggressive in the beginning attacking Rude from all over in & outside of the ring along with getting his hands on Bobby Heenan as well before one mistake allowed Rude to gain control over Warrior using various strategies from boxing him down to wearing him down with moves like a sleeper to big impactful moves while also resorting to using cheating tactics weather it was an object or Heenan at ringside.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" July '90

WWE Championship Match vs. Ted DiBiase - Warrior came into this match very intense as usual working over Dibiase with his power resulting in Dibiase attempting to take Warrior down & keep him grounded weather it was a headlock takedown or suplex with Virgil on the outside to assist if possible but the biggest story here was about who else decided to make it known that he was challenging the WWE Championship as well.
""The Main Event"" Nov. '90

WWE Championship Match vs. Sgt. Slaughter - Slaughter made it clear how he was going to wrestle this match by starting the match raking the eyes right away & constantly working over Warrior with brawling in the corner or taking advantage of the ringside environment on the outside using what he could to attack Warrior while Warrior relied on his power such as a hard whip in the corner with such force that it sent Slaughter over the top to the floor while also making sure he did what he could to prevent Gen. Adnan from making his physical presence in the match as well.
Jan. '91

Steel Cage Match vs. Randy Savage - This was shortly after the Royal Rumble when Savage cost Warrior the WWE Championship & started as a fight on the floor before moving inside the cage as both men went back & forth against each other. Sherri was at ringside & played a factor multiple times by reaching through the cage & eventually getting in the cage herself before getting the clothes beat her off her...literally. This was a very entertaining match with an aftermath that was just as out of control as the match itself.
""Madison Square Garden"" Jan. '91
[Greatest Steel Cage Matches Of All Time]

Career Ending Match vs. Randy Savage - The loser of this match would be forced to retire from active competition while it was noted before the match that Elizabeth was spotted in the audience which was the first time she's been seen since the previous WrestleMania while it was also acknowledged just by his body language alone how important this match was to Warrior as this was the first time he didn't run to the ring but walked as Warrior started out in control only for Savage to quickly gain it back with Sherri getting her shots in whenever possible as both men traded momentum with the action getting more & more intense as time went on with Savage at one point executing more top rope elbow drops than he ever has before while still kicking out of everything Warrior was throwing at him to the point where even Warrior started to question what his destiny truly was. Without a doubt, Ultimate Warrior's greatest opposition was always Randy Savage & this match is the perfect example as they gave one of the greatest matches (if not THE greatest match) in both men's careers as everyone was on the edge of their seats for over 20 mins.
WrestleMania VII
[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection; True Story Of WrestleMania]

vs. Undertaker - Warrior came after Taker right away with hard clotheslines in the corner & over the top rope only for Taker to land on his feet with Taker taking control with a death grip around Warrior's jaw & trust in the throat dominating him at his own slow methodical pace resulting in a different type of encounter than we've previously seen from Warrior as he was heavily on the defense throughout a majority of the bout.
June '91

Ultimate Maniacs vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Money Inc. - This started off as a brawl between all four men with Money Inc. coming out on the losing end on more than one occasion as Savage & Warrior dominated until one mistake allowed Money Inc. to single out & heavily work over one man isolating him from his partner throughout most of the match before the action somehow got out of control again that more people with an issue with one of the teams involved decided to appear as well.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Nov. '92

vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was the WrestleMania debut of the future Triple H but reality is that he was only a body for Warrior to make a quick & dominate in his return to WWE after over 3 years.
WrestleMania XII

vs. Jerry Lawler - This was pretty short & sweet as Jerry Lawler attempted to take the fight to Warrior using whatever he could to take the breath away from Warrior only for Warrior to make his comeback.
King Of The Ring '96

(Blu-Ray) vs. Matt Borne - It should be noted that Percy Pringle III was in Borne's corner as this was nothing more than a showcase of Warrior using his superior power to dominate such as tossing his body around in various ways & wearing his opponent down.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Oct. '86

(Blu-Ray) w/British Bulldogs vs. Demolition & Mr. Fuji - Warrior & Bulldogs showed that they had the superior power advantage early using it to their advantage along with the Bulldogs showcasing their athletic diversity such as Davey executing a head scissors takeover before Demolition & Fuji resorted to classic tag team tactics isolating one man from his partner in their half of the ring double & triple teaming along with Fuji taking some high risk of his own.
""Maple Leaf Gardens"" July '88

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Dino Bravo - Warrior came out using his power only for Bravo to keep relying on his ""insurance policy"" & taking advantage of the referee to keep regaining the advantage working over Warrior's back with strikes & stretches while Warrior was able to take care of one of his outside distractions in a comedic way & concentrate on Bravo still using his power but the bigger story here was the aftermath when Warrior got some unexpected help that he apparently didn't want.
""The Main Event"" Feb. '90

(Blu-Ray) vs. Intercontinental Champion Goldust - This was nothing more than a segment where Ultimate Warrior played mind games with Goldust by playing with his wig & robe, Marlena's cigar & director's chair, and even beating up his bodyguard before Goldust ran away to get counted out.  Jerry Lawler's comment at the end summarized this entire segment, ""Was that a bout?""
""In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies"" Apr. '96

Other Blu-Ray matches include Sgt. Slaughter from ""WrestleFest"" in Mar. '91.  This big positive here is that was definitely a more credible presentation than the previously released ""Self Destruction"" set but the other side of the coin is that with this being a match anthology really showcased him being a one dimensional power wrestler who would rarely go out of the wrestling style unless he had opponents like Hulk Hogan or Randy Savage who were able bring out more of him while he didn't really address many of the past behind the scenes issues addressed in the previous set.  I liked the match most of the match selection (minus ""matches"" like the one with Goldust) because Warrior wrestled in the period where there wasn't as much television/PPV exposure unlike today that we got matches that were rarely seen & forgotten about but I felt that his SummerSlam '92 match against Randy Savage should have been on here as it's a forgotten quality match that for some reason has only been released outside of the PPV anthology as a match on a rare bonus disc on Warrior's last DVD set which this set is suppose to replace.  In the end, if you were a big fan of WWE during the period of the late 80s-early 90s or just a fan of Warrior period then it's a no brainer to get this set.",1396569600,7,17204,4.740802675585284
6202014,3,B00HRYH67M,"I'm sure we're all aware of the Self Destruction DVD, which even though was character bashing at least had interviews and input from other WWE personalities. This made it more entertaining and involved.
The Ultimate Collection is perfect for a fan and anyone who wants to relive the power of the Warrior. It has most of his iconic matches and features him added some input and memories between segments. However, this did get a little boring after a while. Also, he never seems to go in depth with the back story of his departures/firings and come backs. He only briefly mentions any contentions he had with Vince and others in the biz. I wanted to hear the whole story, perhaps some corrections and clarifications to the claims made in the Self Destruction video, but that never came.
My idea of a perfect Ultimate Warrior DVD lies somewhere in between the Self Destruction and the Ultimate Collection (maybe with a little of his Shoot Interview added in). If there was a way to combine the 2 into a documentary-like vid, that would be ideal. But I guess we can all get by with the 2 movies separately for now.
This is a great collection, awesome for any fan or the Warrior, especially if you were a 90's kid and have fond memories of watching him wrestle. Definitely worth the price and worthy of your time.

PS: Some down sides - there's no footage or mention of the Papa Shango rivalry (which I think was one of the more entertaining parts of his career). They also only glance over his time in the WCW and don't include the Halloween Havoc match in the DVD.",1396569600,5,1562,4.539007092198582

So when it was related it would be released the next day I figured I'd find a Walmart and pick it up, well after searching high and low (everwhere I went was sold out) I found one B-Buy that had one last copy and bought it.  So much for Warrior not being over anymore.  When I watched it I noticed a few things, like other posted here the case has a type about Andre and Warrior at Summerslam '89 but that was just the case.  What became extremely obvious is that Warrior didn't seem to need to be making the DVD, he wasn't concerned about really much of anything and seemed to be the most light hearted happy guy you could ever put in front of the WWF/WWE camera's.  For all the crap other performers have laid on him he never once said anything bad about anyone, even the ones that swung for the fences on him during the Self Destruction DVD the WWE put out earlier.  I also own the Jake Roberts DVD and he looks horrible, seems miserable and delivers his memories to the viewer with so much gusto, its obvious he clings to it like a crutch as his only purpose for existance.  Warrior seemingly doesn't seem to live his life that way, and nor does he view his time in wrestling as something that defines him.  I highly recommend this DVD for the matches, you get matches I thought they wouldn't release but hoped they would such as the Rick Rude Saturday Nights Main Event match among others.  If you're looking for Warrior to use this opprotunity to avenge is name and bury guys that buried him you'll have to look elsewhere.  Also if your looking for details about circumstances you'll need to look elsewhere as well.  Initailly I was baffled by the lack of it but then I realized Warrior valued his character and legacy more than to tarnish it with rambles on people he didn't like or things that were not part of the performance.  So in turn you get the Warrior, his matches and what he thought of them,  All positive, no negatives.  For once a wrestler makes a DVD where he presents his work stand alone and not all the the smark dirt sheet stuff that takes away from it.  Here's the highlights....
-Warrior was green and jacked with Sting when he started, though thinks Sting is a yes man he doesn't dislike him.
-Warrior was poor and miserable, while working in Texas the name Dingo was created by a drunk guy about a dog.
-Warrior got over and was eventually called by Vince.
-Ultimate Warrior name not elaborated on.
-Warrior speaks highly of Hercules, Race, Honky Tonk and even Heenan, calls them all nice people.
-Warrior puts over jobbers, a first I have ever heard and reminds people that they made guys look great and got nothing in return.
-Warrior thought Rude was awesome, loved working with him.
-Warrior like Andre and thought he had a good attitude.
-Warrior talks about WM6 like it was another match, like a lot Warrior doesn't drink his own koolaid about his history.
-Warrior liked being champ but was OK they wanted it off him.
-Warrior loved Savage, said he was a genius, laughs alot about his time with him.  Said he was the most respectful guy he knew.
-Warrior doesn't talk about leaving, coming back, leaving again or much of anything.  He deos crap on HHH or WCW but said they didn't understand how to do much but spend Turners money, also he got paid a lot to just go under for Hogan.  Doesn't slam Vince, but puts over Linda. Generally the latter of his career he leaves much out, but clips are shown of his matches.  No Hogan WCW match...which is good because it was horirble.  Overall good DVD",1396483200,4,3681,4.4222222222222225
6202017,1,B00HRYH67M,Don't waste your time here unless you want to watch a bunch of old superstars or wrestling matches or prime time wrestling matches that you could watch for free on youtube. Warrior totally dances around talking about any of the controversial reasons he left and came back. Totally ignores anything WWE originally touched on in their first DVD release for him. There is no real discussion here about his matches or fueds with anyone. I am sick of WWE making these quick dvd's simply too make a quick buck. There is so much discussion to be had about this man and his controversial career and this aint it. Dont waste a penny on this crap.,1396396800,6,637,4.547826086956522
6202018,5,B00HRYH67M,"The Warrior handles himself with dignity as he recollects moments in time. He has nothing but nice things to say about people like Bobby Henan (who terribly bad mouth Warrior on the Self Destruction disc) in which I think is very classy. He also had very nice things to say about Andre. The matches are highly entertaining and truly represent Warrior's career well.

The packaging is beautiful but flawed. I do not know what is going on with WWE DVD packaging lately, but someone is slacking. On the back of this box it says ""Vs. Andre the Giant Summer Slam August 28, 1989."" That is false. There are two Andre matches, but the Summer Slam 1989 match is a Rick Rude match. This reminds me of the WCW PPV DVD. The cover has Hollywood Hogan, but there are no Hollywood Hogan matches on the disc, only one Hulk Hogan match.",1396396800,5,820,4.466666666666667
6202019,4,B00HRYH67M,As someone who watched the WWF growing up the ultimate warrior was always one of the fan favorites. After seeing how the dvd the self destruction of the ultimate warrior pretty much portrayed him as a lunatic that lost his mind I knew that there was two sides to the story. This is twenty plus years in the making finally getting able to see all the matches I remembered as a kid and even some that i had not seen before I was blown away buy this set . The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the blu-ray exclusive matches are really weak even though there is a lot of matches to enjoy they still could have put in a bit more especially when it came to the extras. If you don't like the warrior this blu-ray set is not going to change your mind but if you are a warrior fan i can not recommend this set enough.,1396310400,,823,4.08641975308642
6202020,5,B00HRYH67M,"Let me start by saying I'm thrilled to have this and almost couldn't believe I was watching it knowing the behind the scenes saga.  But that said,  Warrior himself as the set comes to an end says that this is only scratching the surface of the story..... and  I agree with the other reviewer that thought a few too many ""jobber"" matches were on this. I also wished as they did with the Macho Man set , they would have had a collection of his crazy promos but I'm being a bit picky.  I just kept thinking they passed up an opportunity to make it definitive and are sand bagging a wee bit. But  I never thought we'd see the day and certainly it is over due. I think Warrior may have been laying the groundwork for a book  to tell the full story and coming on the heels of this set and the Hall Of Fame, it would be crazy to miss that window.

If you get the WWE's smear job DVD ""the self-destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"" as well as the very hard to find Ringside Collectibles (signed and numbered 1,000 copies only)  ""shoot interview"" as bookends to this set you have a pretty excellent collection and can form a pretty good view of Warriors run. He goes far deeper into things on the shoot interview than he does in this 8 hour program which is match heavy (a good thing) and interspersed with comments from the Warrior which seem pretty consistent with his shoot interview and his other posts.  I guess what I'm saying is that he doesn't seem to have needed the money and is ready to white wash over his past comments which would have even been worse for his legacy than continuing to stay away from the WWF/E. Also , while the previous set WWE issued was a smear job it did a pretty good job of going into much of the Warrior story that oddly was better than this bigger set.

Bottom line for me is that while watching and thinking it just missed, it's still 8 hours of Warrior I never thought we'd get and I can't give it less than 5 stars for that alone. If you are a big fan check out the Shoot Interview..... he pulled no punches and his true personality is on display there for sure.

UPDATE 4/8/14 .... like everybody else I was mortified to hear of this man's passing at the young age of 54.. after watching him with his family at the Hall Of Fame and even last night on RAW... he seemed a man with everything to live for... but he was sweating a lot and didn't look very healthy. I can't get the image of his wife and small daughters along with his mom out of my mind. The profession of wrestler/entertainer surely seems to be far too full of similar stories.

8635191,5,B00HRYH67M,"I was a Warrior fan growing up watching Superstars of Wrestling. He was larger than life and his character was completely revolutionary during the ""Golden Era"" considered the Glory days. My all time favorite match as a kid was: Ultimate Warrior vs Hulk Hogan Wrestlemania 6 April. 1, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario. It was the first time of its time to hardcore fan favorites fought title for title dividing the crowd. It was a win-win match no matter who won and the Warrior was the first superstr to ever beat Hogan 1 on 1 straight up fair and square getting the best of him while others had to cheat to win. Hogan handed the belt to the Warrior, they shook hands and hugged it out. The greatest Wrestlemania childhood moment for me as a fan. Other great matches on the dvd are: Ultimate Warrior vs Macho Man Career match from Wrestlemania 7, Ultimate Warrior destroying The Honky Tonk Man Summerslam 88 winning the Intercontinental title in 30 seconds ending his long reign that lasted like 2 years or so and many other great matches to view. The best part is hearing Warrior talk about his past and come full circle with WWE ending his legacy on a bright night before his death after being inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame. Gone but certainly not forgotten. #The spirit of the Warrior lives on",1522713600,2,1293,4.553648068669528
