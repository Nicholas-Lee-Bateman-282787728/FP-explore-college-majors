7710641,5,B01DBCMSFI,"The second season of the show starts out with Flynn and Eve traveling the world acquiring magical artifacts, with the rest of the group off doing their own missions.  They are brought back together for what they believe are separate missions in the same location but wind up working together on a case that would be the main story arc throughout the season, introducing the two main villains, the fictional characters Prospero (from Shakespeare's Tempest) and Moriarty (from the Sherlock Holmes novels).

The season follows the case of the week format, with the overall story of ""the fictionals"" tied throughout the 10 episode season.  They also provide a story for Flynn to be absent most of the season because of Noah Wyle's obligations to the series Falling Skies.  The group of actors are a pretty cohesive unit now, and it seems like they all have great chemistry (or at least fake it well).  John Kim and Lindy Booth both get an opportunity to shine this season, with the former in a Jones centric time loop episode, and the latter's best episode coming where Cassandra is drunk most of the episode.  They also find a lot of ways to get Jenkins out of the Annex and into more of the action this season.

For those who get the discs, the extras include interviews with the directors of every episode (which replaced the commentary tracks from season 1), character profiles, a gag reel, and the teasers which played on TNT prior to the season two premiere.  Good for what is included (all-in-all probably between 45min and an hours worth of bonus features).  The show is still fairly tongue-in-cheek and does not take itself ultra seriously, but it not as cheesy as the TV movies were.  It also seemed to flow a lot better this season now that the character development has been established.  It is well written, and acted, and definitely worth checking out.",1520467200,,1862,4.751552795031056

7710690,5,B01DBCMSFI,"A few years ago when we still had Cable TV, I caught a few episodes of the TV Series ""The Librarians"" in its first season and opted to buy both Season 1 and Season 2 of the series when I found out that there had been 3 Made for TV movies. I bought and watched the 3 movies with the family and they provide a lot of background (context) for the series, and recently had a chance to watch the entire second season, one after another over the course of a week.

Season 2 starts out with the Librarians on their own missions and we're introduced to two new villains who appear in multiple stories throughout the second season. We see Flynn again in another episode and again in the two part season ending. Sometimes the scenes are so fast with incredible explanations as to what happened we don't have time to think about what just happened. In the last episode it seems like Flynn and Eve (the Guardian) would be stuck in the past (some 400 years earlier) but later show up in the present with a clever explanation of what actually happened. Season 2 does not disappoint at all.

I am glad that the series wasn't just rebooted but continued and look forward to the next season. It's sort of like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the stone but I think it is better. I liked the Series a lot. I am looking forward to the DVD release of Season 3.",1490572800,7,1345,4.270588235294118

The John Rodgers commentaries are one of the only reasons to buy the DVD set instead of just watching it or renting the season on direct to watch.  I was highly disappointed that they got rid of them for Season 2.  How am I supposed to know about all the wacky behind the scenes without them?

7710737,1,B01DBCMSFI,"1. Cheap effects almost as if done as part of a high school class project.
  (a.)Lots of blue electrical effects showing up everywhere and are so fake they are just laughable.
  (b.) Glowing eyes, mostly red of course, and probably cheaper than the customary colored contact lenses that often show up.
  (c.) The recently popular in film of tiny swirling particles (black in this case) representing the physical or spiritual either disintegrating or forming  of something.
  (d.) The fire explosions are decades old CGI fakey. Couldn't burn a piece of paper.
2. Acting that is so juvenile and mechanical it too comes off as very faked.
3. Lots of tech stuff and tech/sci Hollywood speak that makes no sense to anyone who passed their high school science courses. Dialogue has no substance, rivaling sugar for nutritional content.
4. Eye candy actors chosen as selling points and to profit under specific viewing audience demographics. A little surprisingly - just one Asian; no customary nerdy goofballs, and most surprisingly are no Afro-Amer anywhere except a couple of short scene spots.
5. Basic intelligence rating near zero with the wormhole time travel that, again, any half way decent high school science student would laugh at as ludicrous.",1485820800,,1249,5.083333333333333

7710746,3,B01DBCMSFI,"I purchased seasons one and two of this series on DVD from Germany before they were available in the States. Earlier, I had purchased all three movies on Blu-ray from The Netherlands. Recently I purchased another season one on Blu-ray from Germany. The content of all five shows is excellent, and deserves five stars. The product sold here, season two in obsolete, low resolution DVD, deserves only three stars due to its inferior picture and sound. I will purchase another season two, as well as season three which I am currently recording on TiVo HD, when they are available for pre-order in Blu-ray. The Blu-ray format is now over ten years old. Continuing to sell DVDs is like continuing to sell 8-track tapes ten years after CDs came out.",1485129600,,743,4.767441860465116
