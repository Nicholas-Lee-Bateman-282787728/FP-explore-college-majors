I too add my voice to the chorus asking for this on DVD.  It's not on Netflix either.  Sigh.",1252368000,5,238,4.441860465116279
3460120,5,B001AQMBI2,"Even now, over ten years after being aired, people are still crying out for this to be released. I keep checking and checking to see if the owners of this show have finally decided to release the series.

I remember being hooked on the show by the spooky intro music, let alone the show quality. This one really deserves a chance to become imortal on DVD/Blueray.

The reason I'm checking today is that SyFy has just marathoned eight shows and I am watching Cade being arrested by the Chicago Police and he's kicking their a@@ and escaping in that bad Camaro SS....life is good right now...",1251072000,6,590,4.556603773584905
3460121,5,B001AQMBI2,Loved the show. wish it would come out on dvd or blu ray. I lived in Virginia at the time this came out and the local cable stopped showing Sci-fi channel. Had two go the directv route. It was worth it! A very cerebral show till the last season.,1250899200,3,245,4.020408163265306
3460122,5,B001AQMBI2,"I hope this gets released. It was really very good and the best part is that it completed the story, the mythology fleshed out and an ending for our characters. A satisfying one at that. I'm so tired of investing in a new show only to have it cancelled with no finish to all the complex mysteries they suck me in to. This one is worth watching. Good writing, good acting, good story.",1250899200,6,383,4.260273972602739
3460123,5,B001AQMBI2,"I first became acquainted with ""First Wave"" on the SciFi Channel, and I think it's fantastic. Alien invasion of Earth plus conspiracy theory [including Nostradamus]- intelligently handled - makes for a fascinating and suspenseful series. As noted, Sebastian Spence did an excellent job as Cade Foster, ""The Twice-Blessed Man""; Tracy Lords was terrific as Jordan, as were Roger Cross as Joshua, and Rob LaBelle as ""Crazy"" Eddie, the coolest conspiracy geek on TV, and my favorite character in the series.

""First Wave"" was an incredibly creative and original show that was very well executed by all involved...boy, would it be cool if there was a movie in the future! [I.e. WITH the original cast...!] I've never met a SciFi Channel fan who DIDN'T think highly of this show, and I'm glad to see others speaking up for it - it's time, and past time, that ""First Wave"" made it to DVD. I'd buy the series!",1249603200,6,901,4.812903225806451
3460124,5,B001AQMBI2,"awesome and very inspiring show. Would be nice if it were available for purchase by means of Amazon's unbox, DVD or Blu-ray. I have every episode on VHS and then later converted to DVD but the quality is sub par. This would be like fulfilling the last wish of a dying man...  or woman.",1243209600,5,285,4.277777777777778

3460126,5,B001AQMBI2,"I liked this series very much. Just wish we could still watch it. The star, S. Spence, was perfect for the role.",1226966400,12,112,4.136363636363637
3460127,5,B001AQMBI2,"First Wave is a fantastic and suspensful drama, which I was hooked on from the first time I watched it. Now I'm can't wait until it comes out on DVD.",1223078400,15,149,4.0
3460172,4,B001AQMBI2,"You can whet your appetite with some episodes on the SyFy channel.

Go to their schedule page and search for ""First Wave""

Every other month or so, they run a mini-marathon on their day rotation. I picked up 7 more shows just today.

This was one of the best Sci-Fi shows they had before polluting the channel with creature films and ghost hunting crap.

I'll give it 5 stars if it ever gets released.

I don't remember very many moments (if any) that made me say ""NO WAY!"" like some cheesy shows do!

Regards to fellow First Wave fans,

3460173,5,B001AQMBI2,"I want to add my voice to all the requests for this series to be brought out on DVD.  I've been looking for it since I saw it first many years ago.  I've never watched the whole series, so have a lot of questions, and unsolved mysteries.  Please bring it out on DVD.  I will definitely get it.",1273449600,,293,4.0

8278690,5,B001AQMBI2,"I watched First Wave when it was on TV, it ran for three seasons and was excellent.  I bought Season One when it was listed with Amazon and it is still an excellent series.  I been waiting a few years for Season 2 and 3 DVDs.  It was an excellent TV series, don't understand what the problem is...",1423008000,,297,4.086206896551724
8278691,5,B001AQMBI2,"Great show. Bought first season on DVD at Amazon I believe. Have been waiting for second and third seasons. If your out there, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.",1384128000,,148,4.730769230769231
8278692,3,B001AQMBI2,"For years the only way to attain this show was by way of torrents. Finally it got released, and now it has vanished from circulation. I'm guessing this Canadian DVD release didn't sell very well, as season 2 never made it to DVD. And what a pity: this show wasn't bad. I used to refer to it as the ""Canadian X-files,"" but honestly that isn't fair to either show. First Wave lacked some of the important qualities that immortalized the X-files, but it also offered distinct features of its own and didn't simply try to copy the X-files formula for success (for example using an ex-con as the hero instead of G-men). You'll notice during the closing credits that Francis Ford Coppola was executive producer on the show (that should say something, right?) Although there is nothing original about an alien invasion story arc, First Wave was innovative in how it portrayed the invasion and the resistance.

Season 1 is engaging (if you love sci-fi) and it sets the stage for a struggle that lasts 3 full seasons of 22 episodes each. I wasn't impressed by the pilot episode, but I was hooked after being introduced to ""Crazy Eddie"" (portrayed by Rob LaBelle) in episode 2. The charismatic protagonist Cade Foster (played by Sebastian Spence) was well cast, although there was no Dana Scully to accompany him (Traci Lords becomes his alien-hunting comrade in season 3, but her character has nothing in common with Dana Scully other than both being gun-toting redheads).

If you are a sci-fi enthusiast and come across this DVD set being sold, snag it. Even if you find that you don't like the show, it's a good investment (you'll be able to sell it online as an OOP collector's item with what looks like a small print run).",1376611200,,1717,4.682119205298013
8278693,5,B001AQMBI2,"I loved this when it was first on TV & have been wanting to see it again, so can't wait for the DVD.",1363651200,,100,3.391304347826087
8278694,5,B001AQMBI2,"I watched this series from the very beginning to its conclusion, and found it to be well written, with excellent characters played by very talented actors, and also decent special effects. First Wave speaks for itself!",1304121600,,218,5.083333333333333
8278695,5,B001AQMBI2,"When this series first came out, I knew nothing of it.  I happened upon it watching the sci-fi channel one day, and I was hooked.  Every episode was full of danger, suspense, and Sebastian Spence's unbelievably believable character.  It all came together in a series that has yet to be topped, in my book.

Though it ran for a comparably short period of time, I dare say I liked it better than the X-Files OR Star Trek, and THAT'S saying a lot, for me.

I noticed the DVD was available on Amazon a couple of years ago (I believe (there was a picture attached, at least)), and I kick myself every time I see that it isn't available now.  How I WISH I could get the copy on DVD.",1300579200,2,676,4.2015503875969
8278696,5,B001AQMBI2,"Believable science fiction with a hero I can relate to.  Thank goodness the Gua aren't the ""unbeatable"" foes of other series.  Over the course of the series we are lead to a completely logical and natural ending; no miracles to save us, just humans banding together to become one race.  The 2nd wave is the release of the series on DVD.",1298678400,2,336,4.475409836065574
8278697,5,B001AQMBI2,"First Wave was before it's time.  I absolutely loved it when it first came out.  My family was glued to the TV when First Wave came on.  I know this may be controversial, but with all the UFO's today, and women claiming to be abducted and getting pregnant, it makes me really wonder about this.  Are there hybrids among us?  This is the ""NOW"" time to bring back such a wonderful TV scifi series as ""First Wave"".  Bring back the entire seasons so that we can once again enjoy Cade Foster as he searches and fights against aliens.  Please?  Please?  Please!",1297900800,,555,4.415841584158416
8278698,5,B001AQMBI2,"I miss watching First Wave!  I still have video cassettes of all the episodes and would LOVE to have DVD instead.  The premise may be hard to swallow, but if you pay attention, it is less about ""bad, scary aliens"" and more about humanity, and even a lesson here and there about how people should treat eachother.  The characters of Cade Foster and Joshua especially were well written and many of us have a friend like Crazy Eddie (although most likely without the decked out trailer).

Please, please, my video tapes are threadbare....let's get this onto DVD!",1297296000,,559,4.731958762886598
8278699,4,B001AQMBI2,"It's been a while since I saw this one.

""First Wave"" is a Canadian science fiction series. The pilot is one of the better sci fi productions I've seen. The main character, Cade Foster, gets his life destroyed by a series of mysterious events, which turn out to be orchestrated by a group of aliens preparing an invasion of our planet. Unfortunately for the aliens (known as the Gua), Foster is a security expert and former thief, and he therefore manages to escape from the mental asylum where they have locked up a number of human subjects.

In the rest of the series, Foster roams North America, hoping to somehow stop the alien invasion. He develops a complicated relationship with Joshua, a dissident Gua posing as an African-American. The prophecies of Nostradamus and a conspiracy theorist named Crazy Eddie also play important roles in this series. I don't remember exactly how the show developed, but I think it has an inconclusive ending. Apparently, the network cancelled the show due to bad ratings.

""First Wave"" is heavily dependent on the conspiracy subculture that thrived during the 1990's. It's all in there: Nostradamus, a paranoid guy living in a trailer, alien beings posing as humans, repressed memories... For this reason, the series might give a dated impression. After all, conspiracism doesn't feel very fashionable anymore. We have other fads. Still, I think the series is worth watching. My favourite episode is ""Speaking in tongues"", where Foster deprograms an entire religious cult centred on worship of one of the Gua. The cultists respond by turning Foster into their new saviour! An unfortunate insight into human psychology.

Three seasons of ""First Wave"" were produced. I suppose this DVD will only include the first season. Some episodes have been uploaded on Youtube by fans, for those who want a sneaky preview.",1281139200,3,1849,5.032679738562091
