4242882,4,B0041KKYDI,"Completely removed from Hollywood's adolescent fluff, Danny Boyle's latest feature ""127 Hours"" is an almost documentary retelling of the 2003 news story about a young hiker Aron Ralston who, his right arm pinned by a boulder in a rock fissure, had to resort to extreme measures in order to extricate himself. Ralston himself wrote a book about the ordeal called ""Between A Rock and a Hard Place"", which has won sympathy for his predicament, even though I understand he broke the cardinal rule of hiking alone: always -- I mean always -- let someone know where you're going to be. As I said, the style is pretty straight forward, though Boyle does indulge in montages to create certain effects -- the hallucinations brought on by dehydration, for instance. The movie's first carefree fifteen minutes establish the hero's absolute joie de vivre so that the audience understands when Ralston (portrayed by James Franco) is ready to do anything to protect his endangered life, miles from civilization, and completely incommunicado. (What a time for a hip young man to be without his cell phone!) Finally, faced with starvation, possessing what is basically no more than a box cutter and no other choice, he knows there is something he must do. One is reminded of the hunter finding a severed fox's paw in a trap, realizing the animal has chewed off its own paw in order to escape and live. Boyle's off-center, indeed edgy style is perfect for this type of story, and ""127 Hours"" is one of his best movies, right up there with ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave"". (His futuristic essays tend to be somewhat  derivative, and I have to admit I was disappointed in the belief-bending ""Slumdog Millionaire"".) The solution to Ralston's problem is, yes, a little difficult to watch, especially when he reaches his ulna and radius and (not having a surgical saw) must resort to a crude procedure before he can continue. But Boyle handles the difficult sequence with a great amount of restraint and suggestion. A daring director but not sensationalistic, Boyle proves once again in this story of survival and almost incredible courage that he can deal with unpleasant subjects in a polished and engrossing manner.",1292803200,,2200,4.9620596205962055
4242883,3,B0041KKYDI,"James Franco has been wearing a lot of hats lately. After a brief stint on the soap opera ""General Hospital,"" he can now add author to his resume for his first collection of short stories enitled ""Palo Alto."" This month, the Emmy award-winning actor (James Dean) tackles the role of Aron Rolston, the real-life mountain climber who gets trapped underneath a bolder in Utah for nearly six days and lives to tell the story in 127 Hours.

Many of us who were familiar with the story of the real-life Rolston (from his various TV appearances or his 2004 autobiography ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"") already know how this story pans out and how he manages to escape. So they may appreciate watching this movie to learn what happens in between those two crucial moments. Too bad what does happen isn't nearly as interesting as those two turning points. And it ends up getting boring and repetitive after, say, the third day.

Franco, who has the daunting task of carrying this film on his own for nearly two hours, delivers a solid performance as the strapping climber who shows his vulnerability when he reflects back on his life--the mistakes he's made and the moments he may miss. Danny Boyle, the Academy award-winning director of Slumdog Millionaire, charms audiences with his clever camera tricks catching the point of view of the movie's protagonist. But together they still couldn't make more of the real story than what it was--something that might have been more compelling on the Discovery Channel. Franco was trapped in a mountain, and audiences may feel trapped waiting for something more to happen.",1291852800,5,1610,4.850909090909091
4242884,4,B0041KKYDI,"Before I watched ""127 Hours"" I think I wasn't alone in wondering how even a great director like Danny Boyle could make a full length film about a guy with his arm pinned against a wall. I'm pleased to say that Boyle pulled it off, and not only did he pull it off, he made an excellent film in the process. ""127 Hours"" tells the harrowing story of Aron Ralston(played by James Franco), an adventure seeking outdoors man who has the misfortune of falling down a crevasse and getting his arm pinned against the wall by a huge rock. All that Ralston has is a dull knife, climbing equipment, a camcorder and a limited water supply. Where Boyle and Franco shine is the time spent after the fateful accident. Boyle implements many familiar tricks from his directing arsenal but they only add color and depth to what otherwise could of been a simple and straight forward tale of survival.

  Boyle uses stunning images of Utah's Canyonlands National park and numerous zoom outs to show just how secluded Ralston really was. Franco on the other hand, pulls off a masterful performance of a man face to face with his mortality. Franco plays Ralston as a man who knows that the last moments of his life are slowly ticking away and he goes through the gauntlet of emotions. After being shocked and enraged with his situation, Ralston enters into zen like clarity and acceptance. ""Whoever finds this camcorder can keep it"" Ralston calmly states ""Just let my parents know what happened to me"". As the hours pass, and his valiant attempts to free himself fail(At one point Ralston creates a pulley system with his climbing equipment. it fails but it was still pretty ingenuous)

  Ralston reflects on his life's triumphs and shortcomings, most of which revolve around his family and failed relationships, things that most of us would be thinking about in the same situation. As desperation mounts, Ralston finally goes for broke and decides to become his own surgeon. The scene is hard to watch but I found it impossible to turn away. 127 Hours is a fantastic film about how Ralston showed amazing perseverance and processed the metal fortitude not to give into despair. I only hope that if I'm faced with the same situation I process the same qualities. I guess you don't know until it happens to you.",1291593600,4,2287,4.705
4242885,5,B0041KKYDI,"Given the way ""reality"" shows like ""Survivor"" glorify it, the so-called ""survival"" sub-genre of true-life stories might seem to be old hat at this point.  But every so often, a film will come along to bust that notion.  And that is what takes place in 127 HOURS, a compelling story from Danny Boyle, the British-born director of such films as TRAINSPOTTING, 28 DAYS LATER, and the Oscar-winning SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.

The film is based on the experiences of Colorado-born adventurer Aron Ralston, portrayed by James Franco, who had gone out on a cross-country hike in the badlands of southern Utah in late April 2003.  Having befriended a couple of female hikers (Kate Mara; Amber Tamblyn), whom he promised he would show at their party when he got back to their camp, he continued his hike through isolated Bluejohn Canyon some thirty miles outside the Utah town of Moab and, while repelling down a cliff into the bottom of the canyon, dislodged a sizeable rock and then slipped.  The rock wedged his right arm between it and the wall of the canyon, and he remained stuck there for 127 hours, or just over five days in all.  Braving temperatures that ranged from the lower 90s during the day to below 50 degrees at night, he had to be careful how he used his water, and he documented his story and his personal musings on his camcorder, trying very hard to dislodge the rock that was keeping him in place by chipping away at it with a rather cheap made-in-China pocket knife.  It only seemed to prolong the agony, because the rock was never dislodged.  With very little time left, and his water supply running dangerously low, he was forced to do the unthinkable to extricate himself.

Boyle's only error in directing the film, and a minor one at that, is that he sometimes has the penchant of directing in a head-twisting MTV-influenced rapid-fire editing style that mars some of the films of his fellow Brit Tony Scott; and the score by A.R. Rahman sometimes verges on irritatingly loud.  Otherwise, however, 127 HOURS is a compelling saga from beginning to end, with Franco accurately depicting Ralston's real-life transformation from cocky adventurer to world-weary survivalist, and the fact that it was filmed either at or near the very Utah locale where Ralston's saga actually unfolded.  The extrication scene, though it only lasts maybe four minutes and happens naturally at the climax, understandably has made a lot of viewers extremely queasy, much like the Omaha Beach sequence of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did in 1998.  But it's at least true to the story itself instead of being hyper-sensationalistic with the blood.

In the end, 127 HOURS is compelling evidence of how we sometimes don't realize how precious life is until we find ourselves on the edge of losing it prematurely.  And while Ralston had to learn this the hard way, his saga will hopefully reinforce that truth among the rest of us.",1291334400,7,2905,4.830645161290323
4242886,5,B0041KKYDI,"I vaguely remembered the story of Aron Ralston from around 2003; he was the hiker who fell into a crevice and was trapped by a boulder that clamped his arm in place.  After 5 days or so, Ralston finally freed himself by severing his own arm.  It was a story of courage, but it also make me wonder why Ralston was on his own without having let anyone know where he was going.

Director Danny Boyle's wonderful new film 127 HOURS explores both sides of the story, resulting in a deeply felt character study that is riveting, exciting and paced like an action-thriller.  While much of the movie is, by necessity, confined to a single location...it never feels claustrophobic or static.  In fact, the film soars.

Boyle introduces Ralston as a happy-go-lucky young adult, apparently economically comfortable who is charming, helpful and utterly winning.  He's also self-centered in the way only young adults with few economic or family cares can be.  He does what it occurs to him to do.  He's smart & funny.  He's enamored of the great outdoors and of pushing himself physically.

And when his accident befalls him, those qualities help him survive and help him to self-reflect.  He's trapped in a deep hole with just a few supplies.  He in a deeply uncomfortable position and he's pretty clear-headed about just how much trouble he's in.  His intelligence allows him to access his dire circumstances.  His humor allows him to be bemused by himself and to leave some scathing videos of self-assessment behind.  Boyle shows us the physical situation Ralston is in...but where the film truly succeeds is by showing us the psychological journey he takes.  The two work hand in hand.  As Ralston grows weary, tired, hungry and very thirsty, his mind begins to play tricks on him.  In many ways, the film takes the old clich of ""his life passed before his eyes"" and shows how Ralston's several days of dire, boring confinement allow him to see his life and to reflect on his successes and failures.  He never weeps with despair over his fate...he is more bemused by his own hubris.

All of this is presented with tremendous visual flair.  First, Boyle shows us the country...gorgeous and empty.  You can see why a young man would want to bike and hike and climb all over this natural playground.  He also edits with a feverish pace (not MTV-style editing, where you are asked to notice it, but in an organic way).  The use of color is impressive as well... Boyle has always had a knack of using filmstock and processing to help him tell his stories.  SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE showed this on a grand scale...127 HOURS on a modest but equally impressive level.

But I've save the best for last.  Boyle has the impressive skills of the immensely likeable and instinctive James Franco in the role of Aron.  He has a disarming ease in his performance.  When we see the less impressive sides of Ralston, we never cease to care about this young man, because Franco has infused him with believable life and enthusiasm.  It seems like a simple performance...but it's actually loaded with complexity.  But Franco never labors over his acting...it seems to flow.

Everyone knows that Ralston amputated his arm, and those brief scenes are as brutal and hard to watch as anything I've seen on film.  But they are NOT exploitative in any way.  By the time this comes around, we're actually ROOTING for Ralston to succeed in his grim task.  And the film is more about the journey leading us to this moment than the moment itself.

127 HOURS is a delightful surprise.  Boyle is an outstanding filmmaker and Franco is a very capable actor...but they have taken the elements of what would sound like a rather lurid ""TV movie-of-the-week"" subject and turned it into a life-affirming, even uplifting drama.  It's a must-see.",1290988800,4,3791,4.764976958525345
4242887,5,B0041KKYDI,"""127 Hours"", director Danny Boyle's (""Trainspotting"", ""28 Days Later"") follow-up to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a near great film. I honestly can't tell you the last time I was so moved by a piece of celluloid. ""127"" has created both pleasant and nightmarish memories, memories that will stay with me for many, many years to come.

Aron Ralston (James Franco) quickly grabs some supplies and heads out to his favorite spot, the canyons near Moab, Utah. As soon as the sun rises, he jumps on a mountain bike and heads out to explore and enjoy the great outdoors, heading to a spot some twenty miles away. He crosses paths with two young women, Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) and agrees to show them the way to their destination. Once there, they swim and dive and have fun. After a few hours, they head on to complete their individual journeys. As Aron navigates a narrow crevasse, a small boulder comes loose, causing him to fall and wedging his arm between the wall and the boulder. He can't budge it and becomes worried at the sight of some streaks of blood. Aron takes stock and has very limited food, some water, stretchy cord, a camera, a video camera and a dull knife. Before leaving for the trip, he wasn't able to find his Swiss Army knife, so he is left with a dull give-away promotional knife. He tries to chip away at the sandstone, to move the rock, but doesn't make any progress. Over the next five days and twenty hours, Aron has to figure out how to use the limited supplies he has to survive until he can be rescued. Or, on the other hand, he has to figure out if and how he can get out of this situation on his own.

Boyle starts the film by masterfully depicting why Aron, and others like him, are so eager to escape the city, eager to mountain bike in the wilderness, eager to climb rock formations, eager to backpack. When he meets the two women, they even remark about how they don't feel like they figured into Aron's day. Aron is the type of guy who actively looks for adventure and makes decisions on the spur of the moment. This is why he agrees to spend time with the young women, setting his schedule back half a day.

As soon as Aron gets trapped, Boyle has to do something to give us more details into the adventurer's history. He has to make us care about this man and he can't really do that by keeping us only with Aron for the rest of the film. As Ralston tries to assess his situation, a memory surfaces and this gives Boyle the opportunity to show us a brief part of his past. The technique Boyle uses seems more suited for films made in the late '60s. And normally, this would drive me crazy. But in this situation, these moments work, primarily because they are pretty brief. They also move back and forth between more real and more imagined settings. For instance, Aron remembers a moment he and his dad shared during his childhood. They sit on an old couch in the family home, talking. Then his dad is gone and young Aron is still sitting on the couch, but the couch now sits in the crevasse Aron is trapped in, the sand and rock walls surrounding the furniture, visible to the side.

Boyle introduces us to Aron's father (Treat Williams) and mother (Kate Burton) and the love of his life, Rana (Clemence Poesy). These moments, though brief, helps to give us insight into Aron's character and life. Because they are so brief, it is surprising that we feel we know Aron and his family so well. We really get a feeling for him and come to care for him.

A lot of the credit for the success of this film lies with Franco. For much of the relatively short running time, Franco is the only person on screen and this would only serve to amplify any poorly acted moment, any false characterization, any thing that doesn't ring true. From the first moment he is on screen, we start to understand him. He is most happy when he is explaining what some stretch of wilderness is, the history of a cavern, earning some bit of solitude to compensate for any minute of time he is forced to spend cooped up in the city. In this element, he finds peace and revels in every moment.

When he meets Kristi and Megan, Franco's smile helps us recognize he simply wants to have a good time. Sex isn't a part of the equation, he wants to share some moments with like personalities. Later, when he is trapped and has a lot of time to think, he remembers back to some moments in his life. When we return to him, Franco's demeanor and facial expressions seem to be an honest portrayal of how the young man would react. And make us feel he is really remembering these moments.

When Aron finally realizes what he has to do, Franco shows us the horror of this realization and the pain of this decision.

THE moment is both necessary and extremely difficult to watch. It is necessary because it is a part of the story. But so many other filmmakers would shy away from a frank depiction of this moment. Boyle doesn't. Without it, the story would be nowhere near as impactful. Because of it, you might have nightmares. It would be gruesome enough, hard enough to watch if he had found his Swiss Army knife. But without it... I just shudder thinking about it again.

The film ends with a coda giving us an update on Aron Ralston's life. During the moments before this, I started to tear up because he was going to be okay, because he was going to make it, something I already knew given he wrote the book this film is based on, but I was still extremely moved. And the last few moments give us a glimpse of the real Ralston and all of the people affected by this incident. Because of everything Boyle and Franco are able to accomplish throughout the film, I was extremely moved by these brief images.

Best of all, Boyle ends the film, presents this coda, in a way stylistically in tune with the rest of the journey and all of those memory flashbacks/

""127 Hours"" is a great piece of filmmaking. You need to see it. You can always close your eyes if that scene becomes too much for you.",1289433600,95,6004,4.395139513951396

4242938,3,B0041KKYDI,"This movie was just weird. For the first half of the movie, it was fun to watch and James Franco wasn't doing all too bad if a job. But then the second half came and it turned into another one of Franco's odd movies. I know this was based upon a real event, but between the king and boring scenes and the absolutely gory scenes of self mutilation, it was hard to watch. At one point, I almost just turned off the movie because an hour into it and I had lost complete interest.

If watching a movie about a guy getting stuck in a cavern, talking to himself, drinking his own urine and then mutilating himself is your thing, then you may like this movie.

While trapped in the cave, too many goofy flashbacks and images of things like Scooby Doo. Was not able to get into his head to find out what he was thinking for most of it. Of course, the climax was the arm cutting but that was done quickly and gross to watch but again, no insight on how he decided and figured out how to do it.

First off, the main character should have thought better about his trek and taking the proper equipment with provisions. After he's caught be the rock and has limited movement, he videos his experience. This all comes away like a relentless, narcissistic drone. The pace of the film was tedious and boring.

I wonder how Megan and Kristi feel about their portrayal. I felt the added story about the and the pool and subsequent video replay was unnecessary. Maybe I missed that in the book. Maybe he left it out of the book for a good reason.
I didn't feel the 127 hours. I know movie time can't be real time but the sensation Of time presented here was too fast.
What happened to his history? There was no explanation of his knowledge or experience and expertise. The viewer is just supposed to surmise that he knows what he is doing.
And hats up with all the crowd scenes and hysteria? That was just weird. Maybe that's what he was trying to escape? There is no explanation.

His very believable portrayal felt completely real and realistic. So much so, that he had ME grimacing and wincing, ... grunting and moaning right out loud, ... to include even physical, bodily gestures and reactions as the result of my (merely self-imagined) perception of the supreme level of intensity that he had to have been experiencing during his ultimately forced actions of self-inflicted gore and pain! All this highly intense viewer engagement, all while sitting right here in the safety and comfort of my own living room chair. I truly felt a very real part of his ultimate crossing over into that point when the power of our basic drive to survive as humans kicks-in and the only thing that matters is what, exactly, is required in that moment to just simply continue your survival!

Very insightful and some very important lessons to also be taken-in. Not just for the youngstas, but everyone of us grownup peeps as well.

I very highly recommend this movie to all. Even for our young-uns.

4243215,2,B0041KKYDI,"I am sad that Aron let himself be a false god in his own eyes and in the eyes of the public. I can see how the temporary blessings are already souring by his recent divorce, arrest and public humiliation for ""domestic abuse"" (nothing like a mug shot to make it just how apparent your ""humanity"" is). I watched this movie and saw no mention of who really heard his cries and gave him the courage to release himself from the bondage of his own bad decision to ""go it alone."" He called out ""please"" but to who? Satan hears our cries as well, especially if he sees a big ego he can use for his own purposes: a book, a movie and speaking rights to the worship of ""self-reliance"" not God reliance. I know some of you will troll my review: go for it. You won't hurt my feelings but you will be giving the thumbs down to the only One who can give you the courage to cut your arm off to save your ""life."" Unfortunately, saving one's soul comes down to giving God the credit for all the good things and blessings. Now forgive me if Aron does this in his talks, but I watched the snippet on his website of his ""motivational talk"" and saw no mention of God. How sad, because his ""celebrity pulpit' could have multiplied his blessings instead of tainting them. I am praying for you Aron, to get it before it's too late! Strangely enough, I loved the movie ""This is the End"" with the same actor, James Franco, because they actually told a rather sillified version of the truth:"" the end"" will come (what part of your personal death do you not get, folks?) and everyone will know the truth, and be judged according to their willingness to a) give credit where credit it due, and that means evil to Satan and good to God, and b) the Word (the Bible is actually given its due in this movie), and c) give their life for their brother instead of running in selfishness or gladly rooting for another's judgment and destruction (which I try not to do, no matter what the detractors and trolls will surely say, who will likely come on here and call me a ""judgmental person""). I am sad that James let himself be used for yet another Godless movie, in which the only god is a false one. I will pray for him too! Honestly, if you think Aron's life went really well after this, well, I guess you and I have different ideas of what a fulfilling life really is (look up the book Second Suns, for instance, and read about doctors who risk their lives to help others).",1447372800,,2438,4.279220779220779

4243392,5,B0041KKYDI,"At first I appoached this film with a skeptical eye as I was already familiar with most of the story and it's outcome.  I don't think I could have possibly been ready for the roller coaster ride that I was about to take.  Mr Franco was labeled ""a handsome face"" early in his career, but this is where he got to show off his artistic skills---with his face being his canvas.  I was truly impressed as he ran through a gamut of emotions, with a very effective 3-way split screen assisting.  Moving from memories to hallucinations, then finally building up the courage for the final horror, I kept reminding myself, this is just a film!  He lead us down the path where his mind tries to wrap around this predicament, only to reach the final solution.  As I watched, it occurred to me that I don't believe I could do what his character was about to do.  Watching his face during and right after was a truly harrowing experience.

The soundtrack worked, in fact I may eventually buy it.  The score during the rain sequence was energizing, and was the most memorable of the movie for me.  If you read some of the other reviews there are those that didn't like the music, but I thought it fit in perfectly.

Franco was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this performance.  Judging from his work that I have seen I'm going to guess that he's got many more Oscar worthy performances in his soul.",1421539200,,1397,4.456692913385827

4243450,5,B0041KKYDI,"""127 Hours"" is a film that is based on the life of Aron Ralston,a real-life canyoneer that was trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon located at Blue John Canyon in Utah back in 2003 for as the title indicates 127 hours.

This is an inspiring story and it was was definitely touching. Also,it was truly remarkable as the viewer will definitely appreciate what life is all about. Added to that,we also manage to learn from it that the trials,sufferings and difficulties aren't experienced to put us down but to makes us stronger and better as a human being. Also,we also realize that they also provide us opportunities to discover virtues that we once never had as experienced by Ralston who was trapped and experiencing manic desperation.

I do admit that I had to turn away due to the graphic scenes but only a few times.  This is an excellent viewing for any thrill-seekers who are so confident & cocky that they go out on adventures alone like each of my sons.

I think what caught my attention the most is that one second, you're the happiest person in the world and the next second you're in a world of hell, although it may take time for it to sink in. I am glad the script stayed to the real life events. More than anything, it sends a powerful message that we should really take into consideration what our parents tell us because they are a little more experienced than us. We should always be well prepared when we are getting into a risk/reward scenario. Most of us have probably gotten into bad situations and escaped dire consequences. It's one of those movies which makes you think twice before you initiate something where something dire can happen.

4243609,5,B0041KKYDI,"I finally saw 127 Hours. The movie tells the true story of Aron Ralston, an outdoorsy type, drink life to the lees mans man who foolishly goes hiking in the desert without telling anybody  and gets his arm wedged in a boulder. The rest of the film chronicles Ralstons survival against impossible odds over the agonizingly long period of time referred to in the films title.

This movie was definitely a cut above your standard Hollywood film. The casting was excellent. Many people would give their right arm to play the lead role. After watching James Francos lifeless performance at the Academy Awards it was great to see him alive once again in this film. Indeed, his performance is a tour-de-force and even if I felt like booing his awards show performance here I felt like giving him a hand. (Okay I suppose three lame puns is enough.)

The film was directed by Danny Boyle, the same director that brought Slumdog Millionaire and 28 Days Later to life. There is no doubt that Boyle is among the most gifted directors working today. Every one of his films breathes life from start to finish and maintains a dizzying energy level, like watching Usain Bolt run full out for two hours rather than ten seconds.

Among the many things packed into 127 Hours, look for the wonderful cameo appearances by Scoobie-Doo, albeit in inflatable hallucinatory form. The film does a great job of handling Ralstons hypnogogic imaging, dreams and hallucinations that threaten to claim his life. It is only the sheer, dogged desire to see another day and reconnect with the people he loves that keeps him going. No doubt there is a parable here for the hyper-individualistic North American.

Of course there is that arm amputation scene. Yes it is graphic. But as I said to somebody yesterday, anybody who has seen The Passion of the Christ should have no problem handling this.

As a final word, I have a great idea for a double feature. Get 127 Hours along with the 2003 documentary Touching the Void which tells the astounding survival tale of two mountain climbers lost in the Andes. And as a bonus for the atheists out there, Touching the Void proves that there can be an atheist in a foxhole.

He even autographed my copy of his book, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"". A few weeks later, I raced down to Blockbuster to rent this movie and later on that night, I went to watch the DVD and I thought, WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just heard on the news a few weeks back that Mr. Ralston had been arrested for beating his wife and son.

This is one of James Franco's best roles - paired with highly creative direction - we come to respect Aron Ralston's life, dilemma and struggle.  What could have been mundane ends up as being highly creative.  Brilliant cinematography - try making a show about a man stuck in a rock visually interesting.  This is a textbook exercise in how to work at it.  I thought briefly of Ryan Reynold's BURIED film but not the same film except that they're both stuck in a bad place.

But between the brilliant direction by Danny Boyle, and the smashing performance by James Franco this transcends to be not a film of suspense, but a character study of a very real, flawed but likeable person in a nightmare situation any of us can imagine.  We descend into his lonely hell with him and emerged amazed by the resilience of this young man in particular, but also by life in general.  I found it less 'thrilling', but - more important - far more moving than I expected.

Boyle works wonders in making what is essentially a one-character, single-location film never feel static or dull, and the gruesome climax is almost unbearable to watch without ever feeling exploitive.",1381104000,,844,4.7534246575342465

4243700,4,B0041KKYDI,"127 Hours is one of the better movies I have seen in the last few years. A climber falls and gets his arm stuck. He can't free himself and the film shows his experiences over 127 hours of agony. It never gets boring, manages to tell a simple but believable story and allows you to empathize with the main character's plight. Camp and comedy are avoided here in favor of an effectively dramatic performance about one man's ordeal. What struck me was how easily anyone can relate to this situation in some way. I'm surprised more people haven't rated and reviewed this little gem. It got 6 Oscar nominations but only managed to break even at the box office. The picture and audio quality are superb in this release. There is 103 minutes of bonus content.

4243723,4,B0041KKYDI,"I'm happy with this movie. Sure this probubly would've made a good episode of I Shouldn't Be Alive but I feel going for the feature was better as we wouldn't have the bonding moments with Aron and learn about his past life. James Franco delivered a great preformance as usually a character in Aron's situation would feel completly useless, Franco actually gave Aron a very smart persona in addition to his reckless side.

I'm also impressed at how well Franco was able to change Aron's personality on camera because that is not an easy task. I make videos where I talk about stuff and it is fairly hard to change your emotions as you generally fit into one type of personality which is hard to break. The fact that Franco was able to do it without too much time passing by was amazing to me.

Dislikes I had were that some of the flashbacks were a little unclear as to their purpose, some of Aron's ramblings are hard to make out if you don't have subtitles and the title makes it seem like Aron was trapped in the canyon for five days, when I think that is actually the total amount of time the film takes place in, so Aron was really only trapped for about four days.

Other then that, I recommend you rent/stream the movie if you have an interest. This isn't the safest movie to risk a blind buy.",1373414400,,1299,4.359504132231405

This is not a serious, or even believable, survival movie. It feels like more of a Hollywood movie aimed at teenage girls. Its attempts at humor fail miserably. The music does the same and often does not match the scenario at all. The character uses a video camera to ""vlog"" during the movie. Need I say more? I had to laugh out loud at the way the dude is portrayed as a supposed ""expert"" in the outdoors. For various reasons, that simply was unbelievable. They also didn't show how he got his backpack off with one arm stuck under a rock. Sure, it's a doable task. But one second it was on, and literally 5 seconds later, it's magically off. There were several other similar little things that were missed. All these factors combine to make the movie feel like what it is - a half-hearted attempt to make a quick buck off an amazing story. If you are looking for a dramatic, believable survival movie, go elsewhere. If that's not what you are looking for, maybe you might like it. I forced myself to sit through about an hour before I closed it out and came here to write a rage review. Later skaters.",1370736000,,1227,4.316017316017316

4243750,4,B0041KKYDI,"Finally a Danny Boyle film I can truly admire. I hated nearly everything he has done. Trainspotting was unique but I just couldn't deal with it's totally out there methods. I hated Slumdog Millionaire as well. I couldn't understand why it won best picture. The film was a huge mess as far as I was concerned. 28 days later was also a dissapointment to me. I didn't understand why it was singled out as some great zombie flick when many zombie movies delivered the goods so much more. But here Boyle manages to create a stunning film out of the most unlikely subject matter. I meam nearly the entire film takes place in a canyon gully where the main character has his arm pinned underneath a small bolder. How interesting could it possibly be? Sounds boring huh? It brings to mind that other film starring Ryan Reynolds about that guy trapped in a coffin. Oddly I ended up enjoying that film because it is quite a feat to create an interesting movie that takes place completely inside a coffin, but somehow it worked. Here is a similar story in that the main character is stuck with his arm pinned under a rock for nearly the entire film, but none the less there is a life affirming message as he struggles to survive in a situation that is truly horrible. What would you do if you had your arm pinned under a 600 pound bolder, with no realistic means of being able to set your self free? The clock is ticking and your runnig out of food and water. What are you willing to do to have the right to keep on living? I won't give away anything but this film was beautifully told and gives you a great deal to think about. I loved it.

4243756,2,B0041KKYDI,"I experienced a documentary several years ago about this gentleman who had to amputate his own flesh in a canyoneering accident. It was TV, and I don't relegate to memory much of what is on TV, but several times over the years a vivid memory of it would just hit me out of nowhere. It must have moved me at some core level, but I could not recall much detail of the documentray, or even the gentleman's name, so I didn't search terribly hard for it. Then my friend described an awesome film called ""127 Hours"" about a man who had to amputate his own hand. She described the film a bit, and I figured, ""This must be it! At last I've found it."" So I rented it at the library, and even in the first few minutes I realized, this weren't it, brother.

I don't think I could have liked this movie even if I had not seen the documentray first. But having first seen ""NBC presents Survivor: the Aron Ralston Story, with Tom Brokaw"" (2006) my stomach turned with every passing minute of watching ""127 Hours."" It's just a poorly presented Hollywood version of an incredible true story. I won't go into how juvenile the movie portrays Ralston, and the flashnback scenes drag on and on and on. By the end of the movie, with the man's name now known to me, I comitted to find the documentary I remembered that was so moving, instead of this Hollywood drivel. Thank goodness it is still available. Search it out.

What would you do?

Moviegoers are used to seeing car crashes, grisly explosions, and people being killed by Terminators.  But I have to admit... I had to close my eyes as Ralston (played by James Franco) cut off his arm.  It was simply too real.

I know Ralston is now on the speakers circuit, given his successful book and this movie.  It is probably an interesting tale, one that he had no interest in developing.  I also found it interesting that, unlike Bethany Hamilton, who lost an arm to a shark while surfing and depended on her faith for recovery (Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith), Ralston/Franco, at least in the movie, used reason and courage to find rescue.

Academy Award winning director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001P9KR94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>) is a man whose films encompass many genres.  Boyle helped co-write the screenplay for 127 Hours, which is based on a book by Aron Ralston, a hiker who ran into trouble while on an extended hike in 2003.  James Franco (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B007L4HFDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>), plays Ralston, a young man in top physical condition, who is an avid biker and hiker.  While in Utah's Blue John Canyon, Ralston slips and falls into a crack in a rock formation.  His right arm gets wedged in between the rocks, and is pinned in place by another rock that has fallen down into the crack.  The hiker is unable to free himself, and has few supplies and tools.

At the remote location, the prospects for rescue are slim, as no one knows where he is.  During the many days that he is trapped, Ralston reflects on his life, regrets, and also dreams about being free.  After many days, it appears that his right arm is beyond saving.  Finally, in desperation, Ralston uses a small knife to sever his arm, and emerge from the crack.

Featuring some breathtaking locations, 127 Hours gives you a real feel for the natural environment, which has been shaped by erosion over the eons.  A brief interlude with two female hikers, reveals the presence of water trapped within the rocks.  After experiencing complete freedom, and the expansiveness of nature, it is a bit of a shock, when the focus suddenly narrows to Ralston trapped on a small ledge, with just a sliver of the sky visible above.

James Franco's performance is quite powerful, holding your interest, despite not being able to move around much, as the film explores what happens inside Ralston's head.  Boyle's direction is creative and mostly effective.  Things do build up to Ralston's very grim decision, which may have you gritting your teeth, and averting your eyes, does not play out as graphically as it could have.

Powerful, and something of an educational experience, 127 Hours is effective, but perhaps not a film that you will want to revisit on a regular basis.  Displaying talent in a variety of projects, Danny Boyle remains one of the more impressive and interesting directors around.",1357948800,,2832,5.621176470588235

4243797,5,B0041KKYDI,"A friend of my family from northern Ontario once saw a man stumble out of the woods onto his property, frantic and dishevelled, utterly terrified. He had been lost for merely an hour. Had he been lost for a night, he'd have probably been found dead. It's a hard fact of life: if you're lost and you panic, you're going to increase your odds of dying. If you stay calm, keep your head, and focus on the problem at hand, you've got a good chance of seeing home again.

In 2003, climber Aron Ralston took a trip into the canyons of Utah. The ordeal he went through was widely reported at the time, and later Ralston wrote about it in the book Between A Rock And A Hard Place. Danny Boyle has given us the film 127 Hours, starring James Franco as Ralston.

The first impression Franco gives us is of a man with an exuberance for life. Both in the book and in the film, Ralston comes across as an experienced outdoorsman. He loves getting out into the back country, exploring the wilderness. On this trip, however, he makes a couple of critical mistakes, which he deeply comes to rue. He goes off without telling anyone his plans, or when to expect him home. And when he comes across two women hiking in the canyon he visits, rather then leave with them, he chooses to explore further on his own.

Most people go into this film already knowing what happened to Ralston. A misstep in the tight canyon sends him falling, and a boulder comes loose, pinning his hand. And so Ralston is trapped, with no one knowing where he is, and we the audience are trapped with him. Doyle places us right there, face to face with two fears: being trapped and dying alone.

Ralston attempts to move the rock, first with his own strength and then with the equipment he has at hand, but has no success. He realizes how much trouble he's in. He has little food, little water, and he knows full well how long he might expect to live if no one comes across him. He understands that it might be days before anyone realizes he's even missing. In the days that follow, Ralston speaks to his family through the video camera he has on hand. He suffers. He hallucinates. He edges ever closer to death. And the audience can't help but feel a deep empathy for him.

I was reminded watching the film of a similar story, documented in the book and film Touching The Void. Climber Joe Simpson, presumed dead on a mountain in South America, his leg badly broken, dragged himself off the mountain to base camp, despite the pain, despite the reality that he shouldn't have been able to do so. He and his friends tell their story while actors reenact the tale, and Simpson tells us that at the end, he was convinced that he was going to die, but he didn't want to die alone. He wanted to be with someone when he went. That need is repeated in Ralston's experience.

Ralston is cut off from the world, and he knows he's going to die, alone. Finally, in a moment of clarity, he realizes what he has to do to escape, and as unthinkable as it is, he does so without reservation. The amputation scene is graphic. Don't go into this film with a full stomach. Still, it's an essential scene. Ralston takes his fate into his hands, driven by the primal need we all have to survive.

The film is outstanding. Doyle, a strong director with a varied group of films to his credit, brings us right into the situation. Another director might find the notion of a camera being confined in a small space for so long to be a daunting process, but Doyle rises to the challenge and succeeds. He's given us a film that makes us think, raises some tough questions, and ultimately uplifts the audience.

And the Oscar should have just been given to James Franco straight off. His performance is that good. Franco is one of those actors who seems incapable of giving a bad performance, and he's in fine form with this role. We feel deeply for our protagonist as his ordeal progresses. Franco proves adept at conveying an expression that haunts us during the ordeal. His hallucinations and one way speeches to his family during the ordeal are heartbreaking. And he captures the essence of Ralston's resourcefulness, fortitude, and courage perfectly.

This was, in short, the best film of the year.",1343347200,,4230,4.476005188067445
4243798,4,B0041KKYDI,"My god, I will never go hiking for as long as I live, I swear. Danny Boyle is a master at his craft, creating an unimaginely scary situation for our main character Aron Ralston. I cannot believe this was based on a true story. It's amazing what people are capable of in dire times. I never quite felt clausterphobic, but this movie put me on edge quite a few times. I have to admit, I was kind of scared to see it after reading about that person that vomitted and fainted at the premiere. But I knew I would see it anyway. James Franco is a great actor. I really see a long future ahead of him. Why he took time to do daytime tv is beyond me. I respect him going back to school, as long as he continues to put out this kind of work. Great performance in 127 Hours. There is one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen in film, so be warned. And its only so disturbing because we grow to love the character.

4243800,4,B0041KKYDI,"The story of Danny Boyle's 127 HOURS is no secret -- it's a true account of a lone hiker who finds himself trapped for days.  This movie has a simple premise, and its not a pleasant one.  Luckily for the audience, the execution here is top notch.  The claustrophobic setting here is conveyed well without ever feeling clunky or confusing.  Danny Boyle, who is known for his highly kinetic shooting and editing, paces this film extraordinarily well.  It's never boring, sluggish, or jarring.  The audience may be trapped with James Franco (who gives the best performance of his career) in this ravine, but the audience is never abused or mistreated.  Additionally, Franco never feels like he is being championed as a hero.  The film gives his character a pretty objective and critical eye; he made mistakes that could have (and should have) been prevented.

127 HOURS speaks well of the human condition.  We may look at these circumstances and claim that we could never go to the lengths that Franco goes through to free himself.  The truth is, we would.  The truth is, we need people.  We need to be connected.  The beginning and ending of this film work together extraordinarily well.  In the beginning, society looks crowded, loud, and obtrusive.  By the end, we long for that crowded, loud, and obtrusive society that we thought we wanted to flee from.

I'd recommend watching this; it's not easy, but it's rewarding.  Unfortunately, repeat viewings are not sufficiently rewarded, and there isn't much to gain from the Blu-ray version of this either.  For these reasons, I'd suggesting renting this one off Amazon instead of buying it.",1337644800,8,1638,4.890909090909091

4243804,2,B0041KKYDI,"...might have been a better title for this movie. It's a very short story of a self-indulgent youth who suffered the consequences of his foolish arrogance and lived to tell the tale. But, rather than create a compelling backstory which fleshed out the character of Aron Ralston, it merely filled time with disconnected flashbacks, hallucinations, fantasies and premonitions which added little to the tale.

Aron begins his escapade with such adolescent carelessness that it's difficult to feel empathy for the character. He does have brief moments of emotional honesty during the ordeal, but they're a bit too contrived to encourage any real connection with or compassion for the young man. The denouement that we have to wait for through all the stuffing, is not nearly as realistic or compelling as one might hope.

As an outdoor adventurer and wilderness guide, wilderness EMT and rope rescue specialist, I didn't find even the canyoneering element particularly interesting or the self-surgery very realistic. I hope the book was better. I would not recommend this movie.

Edit to add: If your DVD includes the deleted scenes, watch the alternative ending - it's far better than the included one, adds some good followup elements and makes Aron a more real a person than he was in the movie.",1329782400,,1294,5.065727699530516

4243808,5,B0041KKYDI,"Life can change in a matter of a second or within hours.  Such was the case for Aron Ralston (James Franco) who never imagined that an outdoor excursion would change the rest of his life.  Director Danny Boyle shows the challenge that Ralston would be faced with and the means of survival that basically depended on the limited items that he took on his trek that he may never have imagined would save his life - bottle water, shoes on his feet, the climbing equipment, and most importantly the digital video camera that documented his entire experience.  But what may amaze viewers is how Franco does an exceptional job showing Ralston's human spirit despite being trapped, and not to sound clich or disrespectful, but literally he was stuck between a rock and a hard place.

But setting aside that central focus of the film that does not last 127 hours, but rather one hour and twenty-seven minutes, one can see how Boyle realistically show the stages that led Ralston to his predicament.  And one of the most interesting segments of the film is the dream-like sequences and the flashbacks that take place; they are raw images that somehow played a part interpreting what was occurring in Ralston's mind and will to survive that depicted his childhood to a lost love.  But in the process of he being trapped, he did lose a physical part of himself but never his spirit that came in the form of his sense of humor and will to get out.

127 Hours is a thought provoking film that may leave viewers with mixed reactions.  But by the end of the film, one can see the fortunate circumstances that eventually occur that allowed Ralston to share and retell his story.",1327536000,,1662,4.629251700680272
4243809,4,B0041KKYDI,"Aron Ralston goes hiking in the canyonlands of Utah where, in a freak accident, his arm becomes trapped underneath a boulder. With little water and no hope of rescue his survival depends on a cheap, blunt pocket knife and a lot of courage.

Directed by Danny Boyle, 127 hours is based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-true-story/dp/1849833907/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a true story</a>&nbsp;and is one of a small genre of factual ""man vs the mountain"" survival films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Touching-The-Void/dp/B000S399II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Touching The Void</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alive/dp/B000059H2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alive</a>. Now, by their nature, these stories rely for their dramatic value on /how/ the protagonist survived, rather than /if/. Ralston did it by cutting off his arm. I'm sorry if that's a spoiler but if you are even a little squeamish (as I am) you really do need to know that because the amputation is presented in graphic detail. What's more, it's probably not enough simply to look away at the crucial moment - you may want to block your ears as well.

Thhe film is beautifully directed; I don't know Boyle's work very well but there seems to be to be some very strong parallels with another of his works -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine/dp/B000S6UZEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine</a>. Thus he effortlessly trades between huge, majestic and colourful landscapes and intimate, even claustrophobic, shots. His eye for the surreal also comes through in this film in both his depiction of the stunning canyon landscapes and Ralston's increasingly fragile mental state. There are a few strange ""Dallas""-like split screen scenes; I'm not entirely sure what these were meant to convey but they give the opening scenes a false, somewhat soapy feel. By contrast, a brief apeparance at the end by the real Aron Ralson (and wife) grounds the film nicely in reality.

Boyle described the film as an ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/an-action-movie-with-a-guy-who-can-t-move/dp/B00007KGCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">an action movie with a guy who can't move</a>"" and, concentrating as it does, on Ralston's five day predicament, the cast is understandably small. James Franco plays the leading role rather well, starting with a rather bumptious, self-assured and mildly unlikeable character and, having taken him through a wide range of emotions, brings him out the other side in a much more sympathetic light. He stands up well to Ralston's punishing dilemma and also to Boyle's intrusive camerawork and his performance was widely and justly praised. He doesn't negotiate the film entirely alone and the appearance, in various flashbacks and hallucinations, of his friends and family detract somewhat from the central premise (in my opinion).

In the final analysis, this is, for the most part, an absorbing and enjoyable film, which explores the subjects of despair, hope and strength of spirit. A strong constitution will be needed to negotiate the ""money shot"" but it's well worth it in the end.",1327536000,2,3299,6.212253829321663

Boyle has created ANOTHER great film from a plot that sounds like a mediocre TV movie.  You've probably heard the story: a lone hiker gets his arm trapped and needs to cut it off to survive.  If you think that's all there is to it, you don't understand the scope of what occurred in that canyon.

I could write a 10 page essay on the lessons to be learned from this movie. I could tell you how this is a metaphor for self-importance in our modern culture.  But, it's more effective if you learn this on your own.

4243813,5,B0041KKYDI,Wow is all I have to say about James Franco's acting in this film.  Franco goes far beyond those weed movie acting he is known to do and provides a completely inspiring role.  When you hear that a movie is going to be about a guy trapped in one place for 127 hours you tend to want nothign to do with it.  When was the last time a movie that takes place in one place about only one person been great?  Well this movie proves it can be.  The director does an amazing job pulling in snippets of the character's life.  The intensity of the climax of the movie is truly awe inspiring.  An absolutely must watch and a definite must for any movie collection.,1317254400,,652,4.168
4243814,5,B0041KKYDI,"I must admit when I learned of what Aaron Ralston experienced I said, ""Idiot! You should've known better than NOT to let people know where you were going."" I know now that was very ignorant and wrong of me. I say this because I have done the same thing, gone hiking, and biking without letting anyone know where I was going. Thank the Lord I have never had to amputate a portion of my body like Aaron did.

I have liked James Franco and glad to see his career take off. In 127 Hours he looked like an ordinary guy, but his acting is extraordinary. He plays the part of Aaron Ralston with genuine skill, making you believe he's simply another guy who loves the outdoors, and finds himself in stuck between a rock and a hard place. Could've happened to any one of us. The movie skilfully shows what Aaron went through day by day, what crossed his mind, and what he was going to do. I won't spoil it for you. Watch this movie and you'll see for yourself.

4243818,5,B0041KKYDI,"As you're probably well aware, 127 Hours is about the miraculous/tragic story surrounding Aron Ralston, the young man who made the decision to go on a hiking trip without telling anyone which eventually led to an unfortunate incident where a boulder happened to crash down directly on top of his arm, making it so Aron couldn't free himself and became trapped.  He does everything he can to remove the rock, but this is where the story kicks in.  Can he survive?

Of course you know the answer is yes, he does, and... as I mention in the first sentence- this story can either be considered really miraculous that he survived, or tragic that he lost an arm.  It's up for interpretation where you stand on the matter, but I believe it's more miraculous because he actually managed to free himself after many harsh hours of determination and doing whatever it takes just to make it out alive.  Despite eventually becoming short on water, time and body strength, he never lost his will to survive.  Truly courageous.

Throughout the film Aron hallucinates about the things he wants (such as a drink of orange gatorade sitting in the back seat of his truck parked several miles away) and fantasizes about his past and specifically his family (the scene where his younger sister was playing the piano in the family living room and Aron was video taping it is probably the most interesting memory).

Going into this movie, I already knew the story pretty well.  I remember when the incident happened back in 2003, but there were some things I was *not* aware of (such as Aron meeting two female hikers shortly before his accident occurred).

Now I could sit here and nitpick over a few unnecessary segments (such as the first 15 minutes of film which was totally pointless ""let's all have a good time and party"" nonsense that didn't accomplish anything noteworthy, and a few of the hallucinations later on were WAY too incoherent and bizarre and in a few instances -such as a certain thunderstorm- I wasn't sure whether it really happened or whether Aron just made up the event through a terrible dream) but besides that, 127 Hours does a fantastic job showing you a man who certainly had the deck stacked against him and had to overcome a serious obstacle.  He had to make dreaded, life-changing decisions in order to make it out of the desert alive, and 127 Hours really captures the horrible event.

The actor who plays Aron Ralston does a magnificent job portraying what kind of fun-loving, likeable and adventurous man Aron Ralston is.  I highly recommend it.",1315612800,,2557,4.744920993227991
4243819,5,B0041KKYDI,"I'll get my criticisms out of the way first. Danny Boyle has always been rather a self-conscious film-maker and never one to shy away from style-heavy effects in his film. '127 Hours' is no exception from the split screen opening to that big (though admittedly impressive) track-back shot when Aaron realises the full extent of his predicament. Then there's the use of 'trick' moments where we think one thing is happening but actually it's just a dream or hallucination. There are also a couple of gratuitous moments, for example the freeze frame on the girl's cleavage. Did we really need that?

Putting these to one side, however, this is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary event.

James Franco is brilliant (and in my opinion should have won the Oscar over the gorgeous Colin Firth). What's most impressive is how Boyle has managed to make such a drama-packed and gripping film on such a limited canvas. I know the film employs flashbacks, but essentially it's all set in a single square metre at the bottom of a gorge. In places the tension was wracked so high I forgot to breathe! This is a film that makes you experience the physical endurance of the main character.

One final thing. If you get the chance, watch the alternative ending. Normally these only last a couple of minutes but here it's over twenty! There's lots of unused material and it shows how by changing the tone and duration of the end of a film you change the entire thing. I think Danny Boyle definitely made the right call in concluding the film as he did.",1314057600,,1544,4.6900369003690034
4243820,1,B0041KKYDI,"I have loved Danny Boyle movies up to now.
Maybe it's because he finally won a well deserved Oscar for Slum-dog Millionaire (an accolade he should have won much earlier with Trainspotting), but this movie seemed to me to be his 'I won an award and now fancy a paid vacation in the desert so I will latch on to this story about a true American a-hole and spin it out over 90 mins with drivel and a few effects' movie.
Let's face it - the protagonist deserved to die for his own misadventure, and by doing so would have become a true American Icon by leaving his skeletal  remains dangling from a rock in a rarely visited canyon!
Wow - What a tourist attraction and legend he might have become.
Instead here is the story of what transpired:
(Spoiler coming - though it may save you from a bad movie)
A-Hole bounces over-confidently across and through canyons - slips and falls while disturbing a rock that also falls and traps his arm under its weight.
Maybe he should not have been here alone, or maybe he should have told somebody where he was going (a basic rule for exploring the great outdoors).
Fast forward... We, the audience, now need to endure countless dull, meaningless flash-backs of 'happier' times with friends and family while he figures out a way to escape. This tedium takes 127 hours, during which his facial hair never grows and he keeps smiling to himself on his camcorder!
He eventually determines that his only way out is to cut his arm off!
As he leaves both his arm and the canyon he allegedly says 'Thank You' - presumably for the millions he thinks he might make from his TV appearances, book and movie deals.
So - fall down canyon, weep a little, contemplate knife, cut off arm - could be done in a 30 min. movie.

Anyway, I notice that the negative reviews about this movie all seem to mention how boring it was for them. I'm not entirely sure what anyone who thinks it was boring believes could be done to make it more interesting than it already was. I never once felt like checking to see how much time was left in the movie because I was really focused on the events transpiring, however slowly. The flashbacks really were not as confusing as some might have thought. You just have to realize that they're flashbacks. Now, it would have been incredibly boring to me if literally the ONLY thing focused on was his arm being stuck. True, it was the main focus. However, it was still a compelling movie for me. I just found it to be interesting the way Danny Boyle changed angles during some of the shots. James Franco portrayed Ralston quite well during the time in which he was stuck at the bottom of Blue John Canyon. At times, I found myself imagining what I would have done if I had been in his shoes. If you don't mind a little gore and some foul language sprinkled throughout, you probably will be able to like watching this film.",1311379200,2,1290,4.356846473029045
4243824,5,B0041KKYDI,"Although my review is short, It will be very clear.
Having heard of this story, and debated the fee for renting: wondering in my mind, how could a film really portray the emotions he must have felt? Let alone extend the incident into a full feature.
I was pleasantly surprised at the texture, and color of this piece of film.
I would recommend this to anyone having heard of, or not heard the story prior.
Rarely do films evoke my emotions, (not to say I'm callous, just overly scrutinizing a movie is how I take part in a film) but this flick had me on toes and seats edge.
The graphic nature of the scenes were but a minor contributor to the effects on my emotions; but the portrayal of the maze in Aron's mind when faced with a narrow path to survive really sent chills through my spine.  The focus of the lens seemed to acute on all the points needed to raise the bar for the film, not limiting it to some cliche 'true story'.
What a wonderful piece of not only cinema and acting; but of the ingenuity, strength, and monumental nature of the human spirit.
Hats of to Aron, and all whom were involved in this project.
Defiantly deserved the awards it received.

4243825,5,B0041KKYDI,"I found the film '127 Hours' to be extremely difficult to watch, particularily so since it's a true life account. I began fidgeting early on in my viewing and as the storyline inched closer and closer to the inevitable event I began losing eye contact with the screen, staring down at my dog or getting up and going to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. As I said, this was an extremely difficult watch.

Having openly revealed my lack of fortitude to millions you would probably expect me not to recommend this film. Well, that would definitely be true in the case of small children, the film is far too intense and disturbing. Furthermore if this movie was only about the extreme events that occurred in the life of outdoor enthuasist Aron Ralston (played brilliantly by James Franco) for no other reason than pure shock value and financial gain I also would not recommend the film.

However there is another dimension to this tale of unbelievable horror that needed to be told. Exactly what is this other dimension of which I speak? Well you could call it mankinds inate biologically induced will to survive, or man's ability to tap into a higher source or divine power in times of desperation, or quite possibly a hands on discourse on the timeless processes of karma and destiny.

I made it through to the end by tuning into the internal dialogue going on in Aron Ralston's mind during his unbelievable ordeal. His thoughts, feelings, memories and future aspirations are laid out before the audience. Past, present and future converge and focus on one spot and moment in time and space. That point of convergence being the place where Aron's hand, rock and cliff meet and all that was, is and may yet be hang in the balance. An entire universe of possiblities will be determined by what is about to take place. As Aron so succintly put it, ""this rock has been waiting for me my entire life"". Yes it has and what he does next will determine everything!

Amazing film if you're up for it.",1310515200,2,1995,4.627118644067797

For a person in his position, there are very few options available, but cutting your arm off?  Sounds far fetched, but the fact is that this indeed happened.  I remember the time that this was in the news.

This brings me to the problem with this movie.  From the beginning, I knew what was to happen.  No surprises at all.

Of course it would be super boring to make a movie about just one single person caught in a canyon.  That explains why there are so many flashbacks.  Just think how this movie would look like without any flashbacks.",1310169600,,639,4.3931623931623935
4243828,5,B0041KKYDI,"Apparently, I'm one of the few people who had never heard Aron Ralston's story; obviously, he survived - but I had no idea how things would work out.  Thus, for me there was no ""inevitable"" component to the ending - and I certainly won't be describing that ending here because not knowing makes this powerful film even more intense.  127 Hours is not an easy film to watch, even for those of us who can't get enough of these ""extreme survival"" movies.  It's one thing to watch an awful situation that ""could"" happen - it's another thing entirely to watch it knowing that it really happened to someone.  It is also not without its gory moments, so anyone who faints at the sight of blood should know this going in.  Close your eyes if you have to, but see this movie.

The story's pretty simple, really.  Adrenaline-seeking extreme outdoorsman and free spirit Aron Ralston (James Franco) heads out to Utah's Canyonlands National Park to do some biking, hiking, and rappelling.  Suddenly, he falls into a crevasse, with his right hand trapped between a gigantic rock and the canyon wall.  He knows immediately that he is in extreme trouble because he didn't tell anyone where he was going and the chances of someone else coming along to such a desolate place are few and far between.  Even if someone did come, he is trapped near the bottom of what is literally a deep but relatively narrow crack in the earth.  He had met a couple of young female hikers earlier that day, showing them the adventure of a lifetime by taking them places and doing things that were most certainly not in the guidebook, but there is little chance his absence at a party they were throwing the next night could ever translate into a rescue effort.

The meaning of the title should be obvious.  127 hours translates to 5 days and 7 hours.  Franco truly gives an arresting performance as his character's attempts to free himself give way to a fight just to stay alive in the face of a small and dwindling supply of food and water.  Ralston's determined effort not to ""lose it"" is his only hope of getting out of this situation, enabling him to start rationing supplies from the start.  He doesn't waste his energy cursing God or the cruel hands of fate, nor does he ever stop trying to find a way out of the situation.  As time goes on, of course, his mental faculties begin to break down, leading to dreams and fantasies intermixing with all sorts of memories from his past.  Franco does an amazing job of reflecting all of the emotions of the entire experience, including the bits of madness that inevitably arise. Director Danny Boyle's trademark bits of visual and musical cacophony are a little annoying at first, but they really add great depth to the movie by the end, reflecting both the chaos of modern life and the individual's solitary struggle to survive.

127 Hours is a fantastic and ultimately moving film.  The viewer forms a very real and surprisingly tight bond with Ralston, making it impossible to simply walk away from this film and forget about it. Boyle's directorial flourishes combined with Franco's stellar performance lifts this story to the universal level of survival - survival of the spirit as much if not more so than the body itself.  Must-see films are rare these days, but 127 Hours is definitely one of them.",1309651200,,3319,4.648972602739726
4243829,4,B0041KKYDI,"Having read the book `Between a Rock and a Hard place' I knew what to expect from this film and with a few minor exceptions, it remains pretty close to the original source.

This follows Aron Ralston who is an outdoorsman who enjoys canyoneering, skiing, mountain biking and other outdoor pursuits.  When out hiking one day he gets his hand trapped between a rock and a canyon wall and it is here his ordeal begins.  Over the coming days he tries to find ways to release himself whilst steadily becoming more dehydrated, weakened and with progressively more surreal hallucinations fogging his thoughts.  Finally he takes the drastic route of cutting his hand off to secure his freedom and ultimately his life.

James Franco is very good as Ralston and he plays the role with just enough arrogance, balanced with his genuine humility to make you understand Ralston's character and root for him throughout.  Danny Boyle also directs this in an excellent way, that fully shows the claustrophobia, fear and dire circumstances of Ralston's situation.  The scene where Aron cuts his hand off his pretty gruesome, but it is thankfully short and fully necessary to appreciate just what he had to go through during his ordeal.

This film kept me engrossed throughout, which is especially impressive considering I have read the book a few times and know the story well.  If you have yet to read the book I can highly recommend it.

Overall this is a gripping and inspiring story about one man's tenacity, courage and will to survive.  It makes for harrowing viewing in places, but it is certainly deserving of the praise it gets and is well worth a viewing at some point.

Of course, there is a sad questioin to be asked all the time, one the main character asks himself in his moments of despair: why on Earth go on an adventure like that without giving notice to anyone?

The Film 4.5/5

Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire won eight Oscars and many of his team return for 127 Hours. I'm always impressed at the variety of Boyle's subject matter. He's not afraid to tackle crime, drama, comedy, romance, horror or science fiction. This time he gives us a film based on a true story, dealing with events in the life of Aron Ralston.

Ralston likes adventure. He's seen climbing and canyoneering in Utah and it's clear that he loves what he does. The events took place in 2003 and the title refers to the amount of time he was trapped in a canyon. Although that's a bit of a spoiler, it's the way he approaches the situation that makes this film a gripping story. Like Apollo 13, the drama depends on his actions rather than the known outcome.

There's a scene near the start of the film in which Ralston reaches up into a cupboard. He touches a Swiss Army knife, but fails to retrieve it. That simple failure causes him a lot of trouble.

We see Ralston reach the canyons and set off on his bike. When he crashes, we briefly consider the fact that he's out there alone, but he's able to continue. I think Boyle used the scene to prepare us for Ralston's eventual accident.

Ralston meets two girls and we start to learn more about his true nature. He guides them to their destination, but by a route that isn't marked on the map. It leads to a scene in which the three deliberately drop into an underground pool of water. Boyle uses the scene as a contrast to those in which Ralston is trapped. Instead of being surrounded by water, he'll soon be relishing every single drop.

The girls invite him to an upcoming party and eventually part ways. He travels on alone and soon suffers his accident. A loose boulder is dislodged when he steps on it and tumbles down a crevice after him, trapping his arm in the process. It's here that the film really starts. In fact, the title is displayed on the screen 17-minutes into the story to prove that point.

What would you do if you were trapped, alone, and running out of food and water? Ralston tries anything he can think of. Brute force is his first thought, but he tries just about everything before considering his final options. Franco's acting is excellent throughout and he deserved his Oscar nomination.

It doesn't sound like much of a visual feast, does it? A man trapped in a canyon. But Boyle uses all the tricks he can think of to make things interesting. We see a variety of unusual camera angles, such as a shot from the bottom of Ralston's flask while he's drinking. Boyle also zooms out to show the overall predicament and the surrounding terrain.

Going 127 hours with hardly any food or water also means that Ralston is prone to dreaming or hallucinating. We also see flashbacks of his childhood and some more recent memories. He has a video camera with him and makes messages for his parents. Some are serious and others aren't.

It's a brilliantly conceived way of telling the story.

Can there be anyone who doesn't know Ralston's ultimate solution? I won't mention it in case it ruins the experience. A few of the scenes may be hard to watch for some viewers, but it would ruin the story if I mentioned which ones.

Video Quality 4.5/5
Boyle uses a variety of cameras and the picture quality depends on the source. When we first see the Utah scenery, the presentation is reference quality. Detail is strong and colors striking. But other scenes, shot with the cameras used in Slumdog Millionaire, are often dimly-lit. When Ralston uses his video camera, the image is deliberately grainy and washed-out. So this is a mixed bag, but the high rating is given because I think it's largely presented the way Boyle intended.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
Most of the film takes place when Ralston is alone and so quiet scenes dominate the film. But when there is noise, it's heightened. The clink of metal on rock, running water, or the movement of insects is all clearly defined in the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. I enjoyed A.R. Rahman's score and it matches the scenes well. There's a sense of adventure while Ralston is exploring, and more intense themes when he's trapped and trying to break free.

Special Features 3.5/5

The special features are all presented in high definition:

Sneak Peek

Digital Copy

I saw five of the Best Picture nominations in three days, including three in one day. The first of those three was 127 Hours and I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. But I was hooked within 15 minutes and it proved to be one of the best films of 2010. I would rank it in my Top 5.

Franco has to carry the film in the way that Will Smith does in I Am Legend and Tom Hanks does in Cast Away. I like all three because it makes me feel like I'm sharing their predicament.

IT'S A GOOD ONE! WATCH IT. but only if your into movies. i'm not a book reader, and of course there will be missing words from a book. but as a movie! it's great.
 as far as the environment and setting. it really illustrates mans way of thinking. like all man before, explorers, adventurest, scholars scientist! is to conquer everything... i grew up in the terrain such az this, in northern arizona. a native american growing up on the navajo reservation. i was taught growing up to live in HARMONY. ""WALK IN BEAUTY"" as the navajo tribe say it. meaning to walk in harmony. man cannot conquer the land or the sea. but to live in harmony they can. respect mother earth, because she has provided all our needs.
 well that's what stood out to me, was we can enjoy life, enjoy the fruits this land has to offer with respect. but to become over our heads and think we are the top of the world. one small step, and you slip and roll back down the mountain! haha.",1307404800,,1436,4.3745318352059925

Aron Ralston, played by James Franco, is an energetic young man who loves adventures in the great outdoors. With only his backpack and a few supplies, he traipses off alone without telling a soul where he's gone. Before long, he finds himself trapped in a crevasse at the Utah's Canyonlands National Park with his hand wedged between the wall and a boulder that had fallen when he had.

In the five days Aron is trapped, he documents what he believes to be his final days with a camera. After several attempts to escape, he makes the unthinkable decision to free himself the only way possible.

127 HOURS is definitely a movie to be seen. Although not filled with action or suspense, it was done well considering the situation. After all, how much can one do with the focus on someone being trapped like Aron was. If you have a weak stomach, you may want to look away when he decides to end his entrapment.

Unfortunately the producers chose to cobble together a slap-dash version that utterly fails to capture the story and character of Aron Ralston and his family, the events that lead up to his harrowing experience in Blue John Canyon, and the significance of that experience for Ralston and for us.

Few movies provide as purely visceral an experience as ""127 Hours,"" a gripping true-life account of a man who literally gives his right arm to save his life.

It was April 2003 when daredevil outdoorsman and experienced rock climber Aron Walston ventured alone into Blue John Canyon in Utah without telling anybody where he was going.  Tragedy struck when a giant boulder came crashing down on him, smashing and pinning his right arm so that Walston was actually left dangling a few feet above the ground.  After more than five days in this position, he made the horrific decision to cut off the arm, thereby freeing himself from his predicament.

Given the shockingly gruesome nature of the material, it's possible that many people avoided watching this movie when it played in theaters.  One of the advantages of seeing the movie on DVD is that the faint of heart can fast-forward through the more unsettling parts and not miss out on the overall experience - or James Franco's dazzling and empathic tour-de-force performance.

Moments of lucidity alternate with moments of intense unreality and confusion as the hours tick off and Walston increasingly struggles against hunger, thirst, cold, pain and mounting desperation.  What strikes one most about Walston is the amazing resourcefulness and calm demeanor he demonstrates while confronting a situation most of us can imagine only in our worst nightmares.  Walston certainly has time to think back over his life and to consider what exactly brought him to this moment in time and to contemplate the people who've made the deepest impact on him, and how he's treated - and, in some cases, mistreated - them throughout the course of his life.

Walston's ordeal resonates with viewers in that it shows us just how vulnerable we are to the cruel exigencies of an indifferent Nature, and how one little mistake or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time can forever seal our fate.

Director Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufry keep things from becoming unduly claustrophobic by throwing hallucinations, memories and imaginings into the narrative mix and by freely indulging in the hyperkinetic montage sequences that have long been the hallmark of Boyle's style (see ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"").

In terms of acting, this is pretty much a one-man show, but there are important contributions from Amber Tamblyn, Kate Mara and Treat Williams in small but significant roles.

Hard as it may be to sit through at times, ""127 Hours"" provides us with an unforgettable and ultimately inspiring portrait of a man staring into the face of Death - and making Death blink.",1304380800,,2649,5.048165137614679
4243856,5,B0041KKYDI,"It's a question that the Saw film franchise has been asking for seven films: how far would you go to survive? Would you harm a stranger, or someone you loved? Would you do the nigh unthinkable and cut off a limb? 127 Hours asks this as well, but with two big exceptions: The first is that it's based on a true story, and second, it's actually good.

Directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire), 127 Hours tells the true story of Aron Ralston, a hiker and canyoneer who, in 2003, was hiking in Utah's Blue John canyon when his arm became trapped under a heavy boulder. After being trapped for five days, Ralston amputated his right arm using a dull pocket knife and walked out of the canyon.

Based on Ralston's book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, the film faced an extremely difficult challenge: how does one make a feature length film where the story boils down to ""guy trapped in a canyon for a long time""? It's a challenge that Danny Boyle, and more impressively, star James Franco (Milk, Spider-Man) meet head on. In front of the camera, Franco hits the mark almost like Robin Hood: from goofy adventurer to seriously considering the very immediate issue of his mortality, his performance never once descends into the realm of camp.

What really helps to pull the film together is the editing, balanced between beautiful wide shots of Utah's landscapes, up close and personal shots of James Franco, and music video-like hallucinations, with many shots cut together in quick succession to not only condense what is going on, but to ramp up the intensity of the moment as well. The film's editors are very skilled, piecing together the various elements without ever once giving it the feeling that there is a case of Dissociative Personality Disorder going on, nor slowing down the film's break-neck pace.

Where the film could have gone horrendously wrong was the amputation scene. The scene is cut together very quickly, and never lingers on any graphic image for too long. The soundtrack really amps up the intensity, and when it was all over, I found myself holding my breath for the duration. The whole scene was done in one take with multiple cameras and took about twenty minutes to shoot, and is condensed to a brief two to three minute montage. Just be careful if you decide to take hold of someone's hand during this part - you may very well end up breaking it.

There is a slight problem with character development, or lack thereof. During Ralston's many hallucinations, he is taunted by images of his ex-girlfriend (Clmence Posy). It's apparent that their relationship ended badly, and we are shown the how, but never the why. Several times we also ""see"" a number of people sitting on a couch observing Ralston, but only a handful of them are ever identified: namely his parents, sister, and co-worker. Who are the other ten or so people, and why are they so important that we see them?

127 Hours was given a wide release just in time for the awards season, and received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Regardless of how many golden statues those involved take home on February 27, 127 Hours is a very strong film: part documentary, part drama, part thriller, all held together with an excellent performance by James Franco and another great piece of work by director Danny Boyle. Running a scant 90 minutes, it never outstays its welcome, and the frequent trips into Ralston's mind held break up the monotony of being stuck in a canyon. It certainly won't appeal to everyone, but then again, what does?",1304380800,,3617,4.760765550239235
4243857,5,B0041KKYDI,"There are a lot of things about `127 Hours' that should not work.  We know the ending before the film begins.  In fact, that true story that surrounds Aron's survival is the whole `selling point' to seeing the film.  The film basically consists of one actor stuck in one space for an hour's running time.  The film relies almost solely on that actor's charisma and a barrage of flashbacks to keep us entertained.  Flashbacks are always tricky, but more alarming is that that actor is James Franco, and he doesn't have the best track-record of carrying a film (honestly, before 2008 I considered him a joke).  Even the films frantic editing (Danny Boyle trademark) could be seen as gimmicky when considering the film's subject matter.

And yet, every element of this film works like magic.

The film takes place over the 127 hours that Aron Ralston spent trapped with his arm wedged between a rock and a, well, rock before he finally sawed his arm off with a dull blade.  In that time he reflected on his life, the time wasted and relationships left un-nurtured and he kept a video diary of his revelations.

I don't know if I can really explain how unexpected this film really was for me.  Like I mentioned, there is just a lot about this film that shouldn't work.  The whole nature of the film tends to lend itself to `forgettable schmaltz' and yet it really rises above all of that.  Taking the film's opening sequences to establish the `wild child' and `reckless nature' of Aron Ralston, and using his trademark editing as an aid, Boyle creates a force in this film.  With sweeping cinematography that weaves in and out of caverns and crevices; with a booming soundtrack that captures the spirit of adventure; with split screen shots that fall with ease over every frame...it just all works.

And then you have James Franco, who just OWNS this film.

I was so iffy about this performance.  I've liked him before, especially in 2008's `Milk' (where he was arguably the best of the ensemble), but my overall impression of James Franco is `overrated'.  I mean, the majority of his films are terrible, and he's never been too great in them.  What he does with this performance though is outstanding.  He drips with charisma and charm and evokes such emotional textures out of Aron.  His video entries are masterful because he taps into the raw despair of his situation with such calm and unnerving understanding.  He has moments of delusion that add flair to his performance, and then of course there is his backslide into panic that results in his eventual act of self-preservation.

In the end, I highly recommend this film.  It holds our interest despite the initial detractors, proving that it isn't the story being told but THE WAY YOU TELL IT, and Boyle rebounds well to tell a magnificent story in a magnificent way (and this is coming from a guy who strongly disliked `Slumdog Millionaire').",1304294400,2,2898,4.727091633466135
4243858,3,B0041KKYDI,"This movie is just so-so. Franco's acting seems flat given what his character endures - I'm pretty sure I've expressed more pain and aggravation after stubbing my toe.  And Boyl's use of split screens, flashbacks, and a  jarring, self- conscious soundtrack never let me feel like I was really there.  In 130 minute film with little plot, really identifying with the character and losing yourself in his situation is what it's all about. Otherwise, a couple of hours is a long time to stare at some guy trapped by a boulder.

For real life, edge-of-your-seat thrills in the wilderness, I suggest ""Touching the Void,"" which is engrossing - and often exhilarating - from start to finish.",1304121600,,684,4.870689655172414

4243860,5,B0041KKYDI,"Director Danny Boyle (""28 Days Later,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire"") adds another sterling addition to his eclectic filmography with ""127 Hours,"" a riveting, excruciating film that does for canyoneering what ""Jaws"" did for late-night skinny-dipping.

If you summarize ""127 Hours,"" it sounds like an after-school special: a man, alone and immobilized, overcomes obstacles and learns important life lessons before returning to his loved ones. That would be accurate but unfair.

The movie centers on Aron Ralston (James Franco in an Oscar-nominated performance), an adrenaline junkie who hit the Utah canyon country in 2003 for some serious derring-do and barely made it out alive. In a dazzling pre-title sequence, Boyle, who also co-wrote the script, shows us exactly why Ralston loves this life; the idyllic scenery also provides the opportunity to meet and impress chicks.

Then it all comes crashing down when Ralston's arm is diabolically pinned to a canyon wall, resulting in no agony (surprising), but no movement (disconcerting). Equipped with a camera, a few gulps of water and some mountaineering gear, he makes the best of it at first. He MacGyver's up a reasonably comfortable roost and sets about finding a path out.

Franco's expressiveness helps you connect to the character as promising possibilities lead to bitter failures. Ralston is at the end of his rope when an epiphany unleashes his will to do what must be done. Boyle is nervy enough not to turn away from the grisly task.

""127 Hours"" demands that you answer the question, ""Could I hack off my arm to save my life?"" (If that was a spoiler, you really must be caught under a rock somewhere.) The glib answer is, of course -- who wouldn't cut himself lose? But after experiencing Ralston's ordeal you will have a greater appreciation for what that means.

The extras include several deleted scenes and an extended alternate ending that proves that good scenes must be cut for great storytelling.

4243861,4,B0041KKYDI,"This is a journey in to man's mind and his perseverance to escape from the clutches of sure death. Aron Ralston sets out to explore Utah's Canyonland without telling anyone. While exploring here he is trapped by a boulder, without a way to freedom. Clearly everyone knows the outcome of the movie but the movie's strength is in the journey of taking you there to that end. Danny Boyle and the camera team have done some amazing camera work because most of the work takes place in the confines of a narrow space. The camera is very intimate and only one actor.  The one thing that I thought worked in making this movie a worth watch was the reality of this harrowing experience that the real Aron faced. James Franco acts superbly and looks the part of the mountaineer Aron Ralston. During the 127 hour ordeal, he reflects on his life and we get a few glimpses of his family and lost love, all packing an emotional punch. The final few minutes have many people grimacing in their seats especially because they knew all this happened. I was too, but amazed at the hikers will to survive.

The two combined to make much more of what could have been a boring film. They kept it interesting all the way.

This is a special treat in high-def, too, with the amazing Utah scenery and the unique camera shots by Boyle. That includes a number of split-screens and other creative stuff.",1303084800,,581,4.576923076923077

You really have to admit...this man, Mr. Aron Ralston, really wanted to live. The movie is 5/5, but even if it was 1/5 I would still be impressed by the desire of this man to keep going. Not everyone can cut their own hand off with a dull blade to survive. [...] it takes guts.

4243868,3,B0041KKYDI,"The movie is based on the true account of Aron Ralston (James Franco) who, after becoming wedged in a canyon crevice, cuts off his own arm to free himself.

After one hour of watching flashbacks, dreams, Franco talking into his camera and sipping water and drinking his own urine, the movie grew tedious. I fast forwarded until it came to the climatic conclusion where the young man cut off his arm and was later rescued.

The entire movie was centered around the one self-amputation incident. Most of the drama took place in the crevice, which makes movie-making difficult. Even though the length of the film was only 130 minutes, it felt way too long. An hour would have be more appropriate, but then it couldn't be called a movie.

The movie was good, but certainly not great. Franco did a fantastic job portraying the trapped Ralston. The canyon scenery was gorgeous. At the movie's end, there was writing on the screen to further explain something. I couldn't read it. It was tiny white lettering against a light background.

The movie ""127 Hours"" is about a man who loves venturing around in the outdoors, specifically canyons in Utah.  One weekend he packs up a backpack and heads out a remote canyon in Utah.  He runs into two girls and they explore together, but then they go their own ways, that was Saturday afternoon.  So now Aron (James Franco) is on his own and he falls in a canyon with a boulder landing right on his arm.  Aron basically sees his life flash before his eyes and hallucinates for those 127 hours he is stuck down there.  I was amazed watching this movie how he knew what to do and how he survived for that long period of time without basically much food or water.  I admit when it came time for him to get his arm out from being stuck under the boulder, I couldn't watch, but he obviously survived.  He got himself out and luckily ran into hikers who helped him and got him to safety.  It is a true story of survival, triumph, willpower, and cherishing what you have.

Not that I was thinking it was going to be a bad movie, I just didn't think that there would be enough to keep me interested through the hour-and-a-half of a man who's hand was crushed beneath a boulder in a desert canyon. Needless to say, it's one hell of a movie. It's a very powerful movie experience. It may not be entirely accurate to the source story, I have no clue. But this isn't a documentary. It's a story-telling. The story is very real, but it's still a story-telling. The main intent of the movie is to entertain and to make you feel emotion. The movie, being what it was, only had ""to inform"" as its secondary purpose.

It's no easy task to compile what very well could have been the 5 worst, most painful, most traumatic consecutive days of your life into an hour and a half film. My only question is, why did I put off watching this film? Definitely one of the best, most powerful films I've seen in quite some time.

When other directors can do it by trying new things and experimenting, Boyle's style comes off as underwhelming and stale, and this movie was really no different. I don't know what I was expecting. What I was really impressed with in this movie was James Franco's performance, which kind of reminds me of an up and coming Johnny Depp. Although I believe we will see him in more comedy oriented movies in the future, he can certainly pull off the dramatic rolls pretty well. The story is interesting but didn't really offer up anything that couldn't have been accomplished in a short documentary or recreation type program.

Dynamic acting from up and comer James Franco (so un-dynamic while hosting the Oscars despite his nomination for this role) is probably the main incentive to add this to a DVD library...

4243888,5,B0041KKYDI,"I was curious to see how the director/screenwriter Danny Boyle was going to pull this one off.  After all, it is about one man's struggle to survive with no other characters to help the movie along.  He did not disappoint.  James Franco was FANTASTIC as Aron Ralston!  I watched it with my family and none of us were bored.  The movie was short (1.5 hrs only.)  I just wished that the DVD had included interview with Ralston and other special features on how the movie was made.  (The DVD only had deleted scenes and the director's commentary.) At the end of the movie, we did see the REAL Aron Ralston, but it was a very short clip.

This is NOT an action pack, fast-paced movie, so if you are looking for that, you won't find it here.  This movie is about human survival and how, when faced with inevitable, what we choose to do.  I'm sure Boyle took some liberty from the actual event, but the movie turned out great - just like Ralston himself, who continues to climb mountains to this day.

4243895,4,B0041KKYDI,"Most of us have heard the story of Aron Ralston cutting off his own arm to survive, after getting it caught by a falling boulder in a narrow canyon. This is the draw of ""127 Hours,"" and of course it's the drawback, since we know the end of the story. I suppose that explains some reviewers' thoughts about this being a slow-moving film. If you know the end, you just want to get to that anticipated arm-cutting moment.

It's a sad way to approach this film, really. The director takes great pains to be accurate to the original story, while keeping things moving with suspense, emotion, and heart. James Franco does a superb job of acting, allowing us into the excitement, shock, and slow mental breakdown that occurs while his character deals with solitude, pain, and nutritional deprivation. The cinematography is beautiful, the soundtrack a mix of eerie and majestic, and the screenplay stark yet effective.

My wife, daughter, and I all enjoyed it--even if my sixteen-year-old closed her eyes during the ""gross"" part. While never quite as engaging as ""Touching the Void,"" another true-life survival story, this movie captures the well-known story, adds some details for us, and makes sure to voice a warning about the dangers of braving the elements with inflated self-assurance.",1301529600,,1283,4.962790697674419

Some found it slow, and perhaps it is, but I enjoy such movies that let you think and contemplate as you watch. I feel not all movies need to be running at the pace that the 21st century is. You can feel the essence of time as I think this is one of the goals. This movie, I feel, should NOT be a fast paced movie - so it fits the bill perfectly for me.

He fell down a crevice, a boulder pinned his arm, and he was unable to free himself.  Over the next five days, Aron recorded his thoughts on his video camera and dreamed about his family and friends, then, with no food or water left, decided to end his ordeal.

This movie is filmed almost like a documentary, a virtual one-man show for James Franco.  He's very good and believable as the hot shot outdoorsman who kept his head in a hopeless situation.  The whole film leads up to the famous scene where Aron got free the only way he could, by severing his arm.  That scene is very graphic and hard to watch, but it is short.

The movie is a testament to one man's courage and resourcefulness.  It doesn't get five stars from me because Aron is a flawed character and also because he  seems to know what to do all the time so a certain amount of tension is missing.

Yes, the movie is great at showing the power of the human spirit and the will to survive and all that stuff good.  But to draw it out for two hours when Oprah could have made a better version in 15 minutes for her show or perhaps a Discovery channel show on Camping Disasters would have been better suited.

Its not that the movies is that bad (decent acting, cinematography etc....).  Its just long, drawn out and super boring.  Almost as boring as the horrendous Social Network.

I have a new found respect and admiration for James Franco. I once believed he was just another actor out there relying on ""his looks"" and going for the easy,""BIG MONEY"" Hollywood rolls, but 127 Hours has swayed me the other way. Not only does it prove that he is serious about acting, but that he is a versitile actor able to take on serious dramatic rolls as well as action and comedy. I hope that in the nearing future he is able to expand more and get some great parts in future films

Anyway, enough ""groveling"" and down to business. If you aren't familiar with 127 Hours,I'll break it down for you as breifly and to the point as possible. As stated, it is essentially a ""survial"" film, but much more than that..you get to experience the days as they  tick by the hour,minute and second of one man's experience and near impossible decision. Aron Ralston is an experienced climber, and on his weekend away at the Canyon Lands National Park, he finds himself between a rock and a hard place...litterally.

As hard as he tries, there is no way he can remove or lift a half ton boulder pining his hand at the bottm of a crevice. Faced with dehydration and no possibility of being found, Arron comes to terms with himself and his awkward position.

He finaly does what most of us probably wouldn't do, and that's amputating his own arm to free himself with a very small,dull knife that has been widdled down next to nothing from daily chipping at the rock. It isn't as gorey as you might envision(I've seen allot worse up close and personal and in other films),but you do really get to see how excruciating it is.

I surprisingly liked this film, and it just wasn't the story. The story itelf at first glance isn't that captivating, but James Franco's performance is. Not many actors  can hold your attention in such a role where they are more or less the center of attention throughout the entire film and Franco does so surprisingly well. He does so effortlessly and at one point in the film, with humor. As horrible as his situation was, I was laughing and giggling uncontrollably because it was done in such a real way.

4243909,4,B0041KKYDI,"127 Hours is a movie based on actual events of a man who found himself trapped by a boulder in a remote Utah canyon. The majority of the movie is Aron Ralston(played by Franco)coping with being trapped. The movie includes some beautiful scenery shots by Director Danny Boyle. In order to give the viewers a better idea of what's going through Ralston's head and take you out of the canyon,there are several flashbacks and daydreams, along with a diary which he video tapes. It's not an eventful movie really, so if that's what you are hoping for you may want to just rent this one. It is a movie with some beautiful camera work and good acting from Franco, that shows how powerful the will to live can be, even when things look hopeless.

They do achieve their goal though, and triumphant ending of him cutting his arm off and being helicoptered to safety were very strong. I admit I had a tear in my eye when the credits rolled.

Ok once past the intro, the movie stuck very closely to the book.  Kudos to the directors for really keeping with the story line.  The cinemetography was fantastic, and James Franco is inded worthy of the accolades he recieved.  Not easy to do an entire movie by yourself that is taking place almost in your own head.

Wow! I really wanted to see this movie when it was in the theatre. First, I am a huge James Franco fan. I love him and find him fascinating. Knowing this was a true story made it more interesting.
The screening took place yesterday and included me, Clary and Lor.

If you don't know the story, Aron is a cave jumper who heads out to Blue John Canyon alone. He tells no one where he is headed, meets two female travelers, spends some time taking pictures and video with them and sends them on their way. While passing over a canyon, a rock suddenly gives way and together he and rock fall between on of the narrow canyons, his hand and wrist pinned against the rock and the wall.

Trying to survive while running out of water, food in desperate conditions, Aron's only friend is his video camera that he uses to document, entertain and leave goodbye messages on.

There was a lot of gasping, hand over mouth moments and Clary was at one point sitting on the edge of her chair with a straight back.

There were some comparissions to Castaway with Tom Hanks without Wilson the soccer ball. We all loved it, in fact Clary asked me to leave it at her house so she can watch it with her husband.

Yesterday I posted on Facebook about the movie being soooo good and how amazing James Franco was.

Here are the comments on that post:

Lauri  - Ditto!!! His acting was so real and it was definitely a thrilling movie.

Maria  - Seriously! Very tense and it takes a great actor to carry a movie alone while keeping you on the edge of your seat.

Lyn  - Daniel saw that movie last weekend. I asked if he was feeling sick when the guy cut his arm off, he said only when there was a long stringy bit... ewwwww lol

Maria - Yes!!! That made my girlfriends squirm a bit.

Clarissa - Great movie. Very suspenseful!

The girls and I joked that we would have been dead in less than 24 hours if we were Aron.

It takes an amazing actor to carry almost an entire movie by themself. James Franco's portrayal of an injured, parched, hungry, resourceful, Aron made me thirsty. I longed for a huge class of water. Franco looked like he spent 3 days in that cave. It is no wonder he was nominated for Best Actor.",1299801600,,2208,4.271634615384615
4243915,5,B0041KKYDI,"This is one of the finest films I've had the privilege to watch. Chronicling the well-known story of Aron Ralston, a climber and canyoneer who was forced to sever his arm to survive being trapped in a canyon after five days, the story runs the gamut from the highs of his adventure prior to the mishap to the lows where he has accepted death and is recording goodbyes to his family on his video camera, asking anyone who finds it to keep the camera but deliver the tape to his family. There are too few films about what it means to be a man, persevering when things are at their worst, doing whatever must be done to solve a problem, fighting to overcome odds, dealing with one's own mistakes, and making the hardest decisions and following through on them. From the hallucinations the dehydrated Ralston was experiencing to the sheer joy at finally breaking the bones in his arm so that he might amputate it with his dull knife, the emotional journey of the movie is remarkable. I cried as the film neared its end, and I can fully understand the reports of people passing out in the film festivals when he finally managed to break his arm and sever it, despite the near-certainty that he still would not survive. In the special features is an extended and alternate ending, which caused me to cry again while watching it, as it shows different scenes such as when he woke in the hospital to see his mother again, whom he had thought never to see again. Please, buy this movie and experience what manhood is all about. It's not about the ideals women would assign as seen in romantic comedies and dramas, its about what you find inside yourself at the end of your rope.

Truly, this movie should have rated better in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories at the Oscars, as Franco's performance is exceptionally good and the film's tale of a boy becoming a man and learning from his mistakes (at great cost, no doubt), is something everyone should see.",1299715200,2,1956,4.541076487252124
4243916,5,B0041KKYDI,"127 Hours is a gripping film, based on a true story book of survival. This movie is far more compelling to watch than it has any right to be. Actor James Franco portrays real life person Aron Ralston, as he attempts to survive the titualr 127 hours in a dire situation, with minimal food and water provisions. There's a brief opening scene and some sparse flashbacks, but essentially you get 90 minutes of one on one time with James Franco stuck in a canyon. It is therefore a monumental testament to Franco's acting skills, that I as the viewer never felt bored. Franco seamlessly portrays the helpless and desperate mental state you would expect of one who finds themself in such a prediciment. yet he does so in an unpredictable manner, that gives his portrayal of Aron Ralston distictive layers of depth. Complimenting Franco's standout performance, the movie soars on a combination of the creative directing decisions of Danny Boyle, a unique score by AR Rahmen, and gorgeous cinematography, showing off the best of Utah's landscape. A special note should be made of the usage of sound effects as well. The sound for examople during one of teh movie's more squeamish scenes are appropriately disturbing and hard on teh ears. This adds to a feeling of actually expierincing teh hardships as if you were tehre. Overall, 127 Hours is a film that anyone who is interested in the resiliance the human spirit can endure, or good and unique films in general, should take the tiem to see.",1299715200,,1485,4.782101167315175
4243917,3,B0041KKYDI,"And that is: an attempt to repackage a classic story (in this case near death survival stories) and a classic event (the Oscars) as something the new generation can connect with.  However, while in my opinion the Social Network pulled this off brilliantly (even after hearing all the hype prior to watching it) and was deserving of the praise 127 Hours was a bit of a let down (after the post-James Franco being nominated, the great reviews on here, my friend raving about it, etc...-hype).

Alright now that I made that interesting comparison on to a couple thoughts about the movie itself:

James Franco did good not great as an actor here.  Having not had my hand trapped under a rock for a few days I can't really say how I would act but I was kinda surprised by his response at different points.  In the beginning I was expecting a sheer panic expletive ridden outburst of someone in shock with the claustrophobic doom-filled knowledge that your hand is ummm...how should i put this?  Really f'in stuck.  He seems a little too together.  And indeed that would be my one main critique on his performance...he never really loses it.  More like ""hey looked at my glazed over eyes and how out of it I am...this is really deep.""

The opening music is cool but as we get trapped with James in the crack the musical selection does less to build the ominous tension as it does to become a strangely out of place element...either by trying to be ironic, reminding us that it will all be over soon, and/or that there is something 'cool' about all this.  The end music/scene when he is reunited with people is over the top to me...screaming, ""We just won the battle!!""  Ummm....no.  This story is still part tragedy.  The dude lost an arm among other things.  ...and incorporating that emotionally tragic element into the celebratory ending would have added some needed poignancy.

The flashbacks make me yawn.  Someone mentioned that James should be confessing these flashbacks instead of the film recreating them and I think that could potentially be a better idea.  Instead of pulling me closer to the character and fleshing him out more they seem to 'flesh him out more' and then ask you to emotionally invest more.  I feel like the filmaker's could have taken more of a risk here (potentially resulting in boredom if it were to fail) but instead played it safe.

Anyway, long story short this film isn't bad.  Its decent...and about what I would have expected when I initially saw the previews.

However, if you feel like this review was too focused on the negative and want something positive to take away here you go:

Go watch ""Touching The Void"" for what I believe to be a 'harrowing tale of near-death adventure' done right...very, very right in fact.",1299628800,,2755,4.6819126819126815
4243918,5,B0041KKYDI,"I've hiked solo in Canyonlands and Capitol Reef, in the slot canyons like Blue John (the scene of Aron Ralston's accident), down the Muley Twist, off trail more than on. I've always liked to hike solo, with my camera and now with enough iPods to last a whole backpack trip. I also telemark solo and kayak solo. I guess I'm a ""hard hero"" fool just like Aron Ralston, or at least I was at his age. Fatherhood made me take stock. My wife and son virtually shot me with a tranquilizer dart and planted a cell phone on me, though there's little threat of coverage where I like to go. As I said, it could have been Me that fell -- hey, I've fallen plenty -- and gotten my arm pinned under a boulder...

... but there wouldn't be a film about me. I wouldn't have survived. I couldn't have done what Ralston did, couldn't have kept my sanity, couldn't have dared to hack off my own arm with a dull pocketknife. It's the impact of 'identifying' with Ralston that makes this film powerful for me, not the cinematography of the slightly dippy acting of James Franco. If you aren't a bit of a ""hard hero"" outdoorsy fool, I fear you'll be impatient with this film. No sweat; there are plenty of others.

I read about Ralston's astounding survival in the newspaper just after he reached the hospital. I read Ralston's own account, in the book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"". Now I've seen the film. I knew what to expect when he levered his forearm until the bones snapped, so that he could hack through the flesh, and yet my heart almost hammered through my ribs at the scene. Between the film and the book, I wouldn't hesitate for a wink to recommend the book, but the film is way above Hollywood average.",1299628800,2,1696,4.363924050632911
4243919,4,B0041KKYDI,"The remarkable true story of Aron Ralston, a hiker who spent 5 days trapped in a ravine in Utah when a boulder pinned his right arm seemed destined for a big screen adaptation from the instant that the story broke.  Here was the remarkable tale of a man who cut off his right arm with a dull knife rather than suffer a slow, excruciating death.  The big question mark was whether or not Hollywood would do the story justice and make a film worthy of the incredible events or if it would get mucked up with gobs of hokey sentimentality and life affirming dreck.  It turns out that the former is the case.

Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) brings his kinetic directorial style to this terse, emotionally raw thriller.  James Franco stars as Ralston, and delivers the performance of his career so far.  Franco has loads of talent, but I think its fair to say that up to this point in his career he has tended to coast by on his charm and bad boy persona in a series of roles that have found him doing riffs on the same character type:  the dark, brooding, underacheiving rebel.  In 127 Hours, however, he stretches further than he ever has before and the results are electrifying.  Franco is given the burden of carrying this tense film on his shoulders and he is more than up to the task.  He effortlessly conveys the fear, sorrow, deseperation and will to survive of a man who is cut off from all human contact (a character flaw that contributes to his predicament) and struggles to maintain his sanity and find a way out of the ravine.

Boyle's direction is spot on and the film is lean and economical.  Precious little time is wasted on filling in Aron's backstory or providing a psycholgical profile.  Instead, we learn everything we need to know about who he is and what makes him tick during the time he spends stuck in the ravine.  Ralston's fear of dying forces him to evaluate his own faults and reflect on his past relationships and mistakes via a series of recordings he makes with his digital camera.  It's just as emotionally draining to watch Ralston bare his soul as it is to see him eventually amputate his arm and climb out of the ravine as a stronger man with a new perspective on life.  Again, it is Franco who is given the difficult job of conveying all of this and he delivers.  It is a shame that he was not given an academy award for this performance (no offense to Colin Firth).

In the end. 127 Hours is a film that inspires hope and instills a sense of appreciation for just how precious life is and how important the people we share it with truly are.  It would all be completely corny and ridiculous if it weren't true.",1299456000,3,2676,4.469135802469136

4243922,5,B0041KKYDI,"127 Hours is a ""based on true events"" adventure movie about survival and self- perserverance. It is wonderfully directed by Academy Award Winning Director, Danny Boyle, who has does amazing films such as Trainspotting, The Beach, 28 Days Later, Sunshine and Slumdog Millionaire. James Franco, again offers an extraordinary performance on screen as he portrays Aron Ralston during his amazing story of survival, human ambition, the will to never give up, strength and self perseverance. I will say IMO that if this movie came out in 2009 or in 2011 that Franco would steal the Best Actor award, but with Colin Firth portraying the stammering King George VI it was a difficult year to boot. The movie itself is very enjoyable to watch from beginning to end. The music throughout it is fast paced, uppity, and very fit for the film itself. There are not many other actors on screen besides the two girls Aron meets while in the canyons and a couple of flashbacks of family throughout the film therefore leaving us with Franco to solely provide the entertainment and show to us the gritty act that happened for those five days. The movie wastes NO time at all giving us 20 minutes of Aron getting to the canyons, meeting two girls and showing them an awesome hideout with a lake to jump into. Next Aron embarks out on his own and soon finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. From there on the movie is nothing short of amazing and intense. I had to rewind when Franco fell and got his arm stuck. It was wild! Thankfully the film is only an hour and a half meaning it is never dull and does not have extra footage in it not needed. The flashblacks in the film are very important and provide a lot to the background of the story. The most heart-felt flashback that stood out to me was the one where Aron's father brought him out to the canyons as a little kid and sat with him gazing off at its beauty. This one stood out mostly to me becasue you understand Aron's love for the outdoors and adventure. The movie has everything it needs to provide the watcher with a strong reenactment of what happened back in April of 2003. Aron Ralston did what many never would have had the ability to do. He was a true survivor and many need to see this to understand his story, it's a great one! I bought this movie and was not disappointed at all! I'd recommend the same. I hope I've been helpful..

4243924,4,B0041KKYDI,"Having read Aron Ralston's account of his ordeal while trapped, I was impressed by how much of the book the screenwriters and director managed to retain in the film.  James Franco and Danny Boyle, the director, do a great job of capturing Aron's sense of adventure, his emotions while stuck, and his agony when finally getting himself loose from the boulder that had pinned him inside a slot canyon.  Boyle's rapid-fire style of direction, with quick cuts, speeded-up sequences, and hallucinations on Aron's part help to build the atmosphere of the canyon and the inside of Aron's mind and emotions.  At first you wonder how anyone could sustain a film about someone being stuck for more than 5 days in the slot, but these guys manage to pull it off without a moment of dullness.

Good soundtrack too, and some nice touches during the hallucinatory sequences.

4243928,5,B0041KKYDI,"Films such as 127 HOURS come along all too rarely.  Based on a true story, the memoir by Aron Ralston 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place',  and prepared for the screen by Simon Beaufoy and writer/director Danny Boyle, this film is a paean to the indomitable spirit of man.  Basically a one man drama - Aron Ralston (James Franco) - the writers and director have managed to transfer enough outside of the story energy to keep the film in motion at all times.

The story is well-known: Aron Ralston (Franco) set out for one of his freewheeling adventures in April 2003 in the canyons of Utah, befriends two girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) in hiking distress, and proceeds on his hike only to fall into a crevice with a heavy rock crushing his right hand.  The story is about the 127 hours Ralston endures and ultimately survives by excising his own partial right extremity, thus limiting all his efforts to the use of his left hand, freeing himself until he can return home to his parents (Kate Burton and Treat Williams) and his girlfriend (Clmence Posy).  The magic in the film is how immersed Franco is in this role, keeping our attention and compassion through his on-videocamera jokes and pathos.  How he survives is a wonder of nature, of ingenuity, and faith,  and that is what sets the film apart as being so special.  Grady Harp, March 11",1299283200,,1347,4.579166666666667

- Disc 2: Digital Copy""

After speaking with an Amazon representative and researching this a little bit, I discovered that these features are only a part of the Blu-Ray product. So, if you're into Blu-Ray (I am not, but that's a whole other story), then you will get everything you ordered. Unfortunately, the DVD comes up short, at least based on Amazon's description of it.

4243931,5,B0041KKYDI,"This is one of the most compelling films I've EVER seen, and, so far, I've seen it four times.  Word of mouth seems to label ""127 Hours"" as a movie about a guy who cut off his arm; it's SO much more.  Aron Ralston's courageous story of survival, determination, hope, good and bad fortune, glory, and love of family, adventure and the environment along with revival and rebirth is the most inspiring and glorius episodes I have encountered.  From his near death prophetic visions, to his struggles with the elements & lack of food and water to his creative handling of his close encounter with death, I found this film a well produced, amazingly acted and perfectly directed retelling of one man's struggle with the elements that brought challenges that even the most determined outdoorsman could overcome, let alone survive.  The screen play is as imaginative, inspiring and emotional as Mr. Ralston's book, BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. It's rather sad that due to lack of cinematic time, the film ends with Aron's triumphant rescue, since many new challenges awaited him, like Aron's stuggle with bone infections, which are inspiringly detailed in his book. Without a doubt, ""127 Hours"" is now my favorite pieces of cinema creativity, along with Aron Ralston's inspiring life and epic story of survival and living.
As far as the DVD release goes, it's a gem...at least the blu ray edition I got from Amazon is!

4243932,5,B0041KKYDI,"4.5 stars for the film, 5 for Ralston

One of the most intense magazine pieces I've ever read is Ralston's own tale of his harrowing adventure/nightmare in Outside, September, 2004. I can still recall reading it while laying in bed in a little cabin on a cold night in the Rockies and feeling so luxurious just being alive, and wincing in vicarious pain as Ralston told his tale. I assume you know the tale, but if by some fluke you don't, stop reading this now! And avoid other reviews, friends, reading the video box, etc, because if you were to see this film without knowing the story ahead of time, it would probably blow your mind forever. Rarely has a true story seemed more dreamlike(or nightmarish) than Aron's.

Happily, Danny Boyle and James Franco do his tale justice with this starkly real yet phantasmagorical film. Boyle's direction is typically shining and surreal, using sun flares on the lense and various other techniques to bring home the vast grandeur of the Utah canyonlands, and though nothing compares to their phenomenal impact in person, this film (and a fine blu-ray transfer) does a good job at giving us a hint. Likewise does Franco bring Ralston to life, with a very fine performance that never grates or feels Hollywood. He conveys the suffering, and the humor, well, and I believed him.

But what really stands out about this film is Aron Ralston. Maybe most of us would have it in us to do what he did...but I doubt it. There are epic feats of endurance, and then there's cutting off part of your body by yourself and rappelling down a cliff in a desert and stumbling to safety. I like to think I could do it, but could I? That's the question this film and story raises, and I get a little edgy every time it comes to mind, as I still hike the high wilderness solo, without filing a flight plan. Part of me frankly enjoys the knowledge that one misstep and it might be curtains: life becomes heightened like never before, and the rewards are for me worth the risks. But then again, I don't climb in totally remote slot canyons. I've had a couple moments alone at 13,000 feet where death was a very real possibility, and they woke me up to a startlingly large extent, but trapped under a rock for four days in the desert? Not sure I could do what Ralston did. And watching this fine film of the feat, and knowing what steps the mind would have to take to get there? A vivid, deep experience, and I cried a couple times just thinking about how much our loved ones mean to us when the chips are down; Boyle's finest moments here are those dream sequences, and the connection with Trainspotting and other Boyle classics becomes clear. The man loves those who live way out on the edge, and he's not quick to moralize about the inherent dangers. He knows what it means to crave more, ever more, of what we love most.

Which is why still some of us persist in risking it all for something magical that's out there: we want to become part of it. Which seems insane...until you've felt what's out there, and felt it stir what's in you. Then it makes sense, as much as it can. The human spirit demands adventure, new limits, stretched boundaries, and sometimes that leads to Aron Ralston's predicament. Which doesn't make him right or wrong, but just a person looking for more than most of us. And seeing as he's still climbing and loving the wilderness, it seems safe to say that, despite the high price, he continues to find it.

There's a little gore here, but really very little, so don't let that dissuade you. What really matters in 127 is heart, and there's plenty of that in both this film and in Aron Ralston. Rarely has a real-life ending been more satisfying; now there's a kid who's going to see some beautiful places! Blessings to you and your family, brother.",1299110400,2,3795,4.518195050946143

4243939,5,B0041KKYDI,"One fateful day in the canyons of Utah a lone climber fell into the worst predicament he could have imagined.  In April of 2003 Aron Ralston found out what he was made of, literally and figuratively.  While Aron was trekking the rocky terrain of ""Blue John Canyon"" his luck ran out and fell due to a loose boulder which crushed and trapped his arm against the rock wall.  His story is one of hope, triumph, terror and sheer determination.  The perfect setting for an intensely satisfying movie experience.  Thankfully, director Danny Boyle delivered this in spades.

""127 Hours"" is a full feature film about this tragic but conquering incident.  Aron Ralston, an avid climber and hiker, played by the talented James Franco, made the near fatal mistake of not telling anyone where he was going.  Ralston sets out to his ""home away from home"" and meets a couple of less experienced hikers looking for some adventure.  He takes them to a beautiful spot where they enjoy a brief swim, though this section is not factual to the real experience.  Afterward, Ralston continues his trek and ends up, as the real Aron Ralston named his book, stuck ""between a rock and a hard place"".  What follows is his incredible journey to free himself, rappel a 65 foot rock wall and hike over 8 miles to finally be rescued in one of the most emotional endings in a film to date.

There were a lot of challenges in developing a feature length film based on Ralston's amazing story.  Many wondered how director Danny Boyle would keep the audience engaged since the setting is a single place with a single character.  Not to mention the fact that we all know how the story ends up.  Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor and Best Picture it's obvious they overcame these challenges.  For one thing, the pacing is perfect as was the accompanying music.  Boyle seamlessly transitioned slow dismal scenes with those of  courage and optimism.  This worked largely due to the variety of music used in the film.  From the outstanding original score from A.R. Rahmin to the uplifting ""Lovely Day"" by Bill Withers and the surreal finale from Sigur Rs.  To me it seemed like the music was an auditory way of showing his inner thoughts during the whole experience, the soundtrack was a character all it's own.

""127 Hours"" is a powerful movie and story.  One in which could not have been so successful had it not been for the astounding direction and cinematography.  Boyle's team brought the experience of trekking the Utah canyons to life with fluid camera work.  A closeup shot of Franco's hand sliding against the rock wall while navigating through the canyon is just one of many examples.  Personally, I thought this film should have been not only nominated for Best Cinematography in the Academy Awards but also won.  Boyle is a master of his craft and this film further propels him to the top of the list of best directors working today.

I won't get into the ""meat"" of the amputation scene, but I will say that it was one of the most intense things I've witnessed in film.  That is saying a lot considering the types of movies I watch and review here.  Disturbingly accurate this scene was filmed in one take using multiple camera's and only one prosthetic arm.  Yet another testimony to Franco's superb acting.  Following the amputation scene we see more outstanding direction and cinematography as Ralston makes the final journey to his rescue.  The best part about this final sequence is that we know what happens but while watching we are at the edge of our seat.  We put aside what we already know and just go along for the ride.  The direction causes us to be unsure if he will make it or not.  That is the brilliance of ""127 Hours"" and Boyle's production team.

I highly recommend this film as it is one of the best stories and film of at least the last few years.  Boyle said it best and I'll end this review with his quote:

""This is a film about how precious life is. And it's only precious because of other people. It's not precious in itself, which is what we sometimes think - we think the will to survive is an individualistic thing. ... But it's actually connected to other people. And that's what the life essence is really about - it's always about other people, even in the loneliest places."" - Danny Boyle

4243945,4,B0041KKYDI,"Based on the harrowing tale of survival by Aron Ralston and adapted by Simon Beaufoy and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later), 127 Hours challenges the viewer to share in a difficult, life changing event that most people could never contemplate.  It's quite a feat to engage and emotionally move an audience focused solely on one person in one place.  For an actor to pull this off is a great testament to James Franco's acting skills and physical prowess as well as Boyle's ingenuity behind the camera.

In April, 2003, Aron Ralston (Franco) escapes the rat race of the city to go hiking in a remote terrain.  After parking his car, he goes mountain biking and then by foot deeper into isolation.  There, he comes upon two hikers, Megan and Kristi, who are a bit lost.  He tells them that the earth with its rocks and mountains is always moving.  How prophetic!  Aron guides the women and puts them on the right track after a brief adventure in a cave and a sparkling pool of water.  Later, he proceeds on his trek of solitude and, while climbing between a narrow ravine, slips, and as he falls, a large bolder tumbles and pins his arm against the wall.  Trying everything possible to dislodge the rock, he finds he is hopelessly trapped with limited supplies.  No one knows where he is because he was didn't care enough to mention it to family or friends.  He is a confident, even cocky explorer whose cavalier attitude changes through this ordeal.  He displays some amazing resourcefulness in such moments as when he erects a mini tent to protect his head from the elements.  As he waits in vain for help that is not coming, he contemplates his survival skills and evaluates his life and relationships.  Life is precious, and he must do whatever he can to survive even if it means the unthinkable.

The entire film works despite the fact it centers exclusively on one actor.  (The Spirit of St. Louis is another that comes to mind.)  Franco accomplishes the difficult task by making us care for an arrogant, free spirit who knows no fear.  The film focuses on minute details that could easily be glossed over. The simplest of acts become a tortuous struggle as when his pocket knife falls and he must retrieve it while still pinned.  A drink of water from his ever shrinking supply becomes an agonizing death watch.  The flashback scenes give us some background into his family life and a former girlfriend.  He even fantasizes a vision of a boy, a son that he will perhaps have someday?  He regrets the things left undone or unsaid and resolves to make changes in his life if he makes it out alive.  The fact that we know the outcome does not at all diminish the agony we feel for him in close quarters and his determination to survive.  In a way the big rock is a kind of metaphor for his life. What should be a liberating journey becomes a test of survival, and as the hours go by and one day bleeds into the next, we become a part of his limited world complete with cracks of sunlight and an occasional bird or insect.  After awhile you wonder if we really see images he is seeing, or if it is nothing more than a mirage or hallucination.  During his ordeal he uses his mini video camera to document his plight and to report on his situation and feelings.  The camera becomes a sort of confessor for him.

Yes, the scene where he must separate himself from the rock is excruciating but never exploitive.  The subsequent scenes where he makes his way back to civilization and encounters other hikers are powerfully heart wrenching yet life affirming.  It packs a punch and wrings you emotionally as Franco finds salvation when all hope is seemingly lost.  By film's end we breathe a collective sigh of relief.  Yet it is the cumulative effect of emotions and our shared experience with him that are truly affecting.

Boyle utilizes handheld cameras and crisp editing to keep things moving along in a methodically paced narrative.  It is ironic at how the beautiful landscape is in sharp contrast to the horror that Aron must experience.  The film may set a record for having the longest running time before displaying its first title card.  There is a nice epilogue which alludes to his prophetic visions from before.  This is not a morbid exercise in claustrophobia or grossness but rather a realistic recreation of the triumph of the human spirit against impossible odds and the bleakest of settings.",1298592000,2,4429,4.630769230769231
4243946,5,B0041KKYDI,"I vaguely remembered the story of Aron Ralston from around 2003; he was the hiker who fell into a crevice and was trapped by a boulder that clamped his arm in place. After 5 days or so, Ralston finally freed himself by severing his own arm. It was a story of courage, but it also make me wonder why Ralston was on his own without having let anyone know where he was going.

Director Danny Boyle's wonderful new film 127 HOURS explores both sides of the story, resulting in a deeply felt character study that is riveting, exciting and paced like an action-thriller. While much of the movie is, by necessity, confined to a single location...it never feels claustrophobic or static. In fact, the film soars.

Boyle introduces Ralston as a happy-go-lucky young adult, apparently economically comfortable who is charming, helpful and utterly winning. He's also self-centered in the way only young adults with few economic or family cares can be. He does what it occurs to him to do. He's smart & funny. He's enamored of the great outdoors and of pushing himself physically.

And when his accident befalls him, those qualities help him survive and help him to self-reflect. He's trapped in a deep hole with just a few supplies. He in a deeply uncomfortable position and he's pretty clear-headed about just how much trouble he's in. His intelligence allows him to access his dire circumstances. His humor allows him to be bemused by himself and to leave some scathing videos of self-assessment behind. Boyle shows us the physical situation Ralston is in...but where the film truly succeeds is by showing us the psychological journey he takes. The two work hand in hand. As Ralston grows weary, tired, hungry and very thirsty, his mind begins to play tricks on him. In many ways, the film takes the old clich&eacute; of ""his life passed before his eyes"" and shows how Ralston's several days of dire, boring confinement allow him to see his life and to reflect on his successes and failures. He never weeps with despair over his fate...he is more bemused by his own hubris.

All of this is presented with tremendous visual flair. First, Boyle shows us the country...gorgeous and empty. You can see why a young man would want to bike and hike and climb all over this natural playground. He also edits with a feverish pace (not MTV-style editing, where you are asked to notice it, but in an organic way). The use of color is impressive as well... Boyle has always had a knack of using filmstock and processing to help him tell his stories. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE showed this on a grand scale...127 HOURS on a modest but equally impressive level.

But I've save the best for last. Boyle has the impressive skills of the immensely likeable and instinctive James Franco in the role of Aron. He has a disarming ease in his performance. When we see the less impressive sides of Ralston, we never cease to care about this young man, because Franco has infused him with believable life and enthusiasm. It seems like a simple performance...but it's actually loaded with complexity. But Franco never labors over his acting...it seems to flow.

Everyone knows that Ralston amputated his arm, and those brief scenes are as brutal and hard to watch as anything I've seen on film. But they are NOT exploitative in any way. By the time this comes around, we're actually ROOTING for Ralston to succeed in his grim task. And the film is more about the journey leading us to this moment than the moment itself.

127 HOURS is a delightful surprise. Boyle is an outstanding filmmaker and Franco is a very capable actor...but they have taken the elements of what would sound like a rather lurid ""TV movie-of-the-week"" subject and turned it into a life-affirming, even uplifting drama. It's a must-see.",1298505600,2,3767,4.77726574500768
4243947,4,B0041KKYDI,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I wanted to see '127 Hours' because I kept wondering how anyone can make a film about a guy who gets his arm stuck under a boulder while hiking in the desert and then has to cut it off. Not only was I aware of the whole concept of the film and the ending but I also was wondering how do you make an interesting film about someone who is stuck in one small place for such a long period of time.

To my great surprise, '127 Hours' is a riveting tale of one man's survival in the face of certain death. How does director Danny Boyle pull it off? For starters, James Franco is a brilliant casting choice to play Aron Ralston, the daredevil hiker who ends up between a 'rock and a hard place'. Franco is an immensely likable fellow who conveys Ralston's reckless and devil may care attitude that leads him to his date with destiny. When Ralston meets the two female hikers and escorts them to an underground grotto where they go swimming, Boyle uses that scene to reinforce our perception of Ralston as a daredevil, who risks his own life (as well as the lives of two strangers) as he seeks one more thrill, sliding between a crevice, and diving into the grotto, from a distance that an ordinary person would consider to be unsafe.

The incredible thing about '127 Hours' (and I found this out after I watched the film) is that almost everything that we see actually happened. Ralston did have a video camera and filmed himself while his arm was stuck under the rock. And the video camera that was used in the film, was also the actual camera Ralston used when he was trapped! Boyle builds the tension simply by documenting everything that happened. At first Ralston believes he can move the rock through sheer strength. When that fails, he tries to be more calculating by using a pocket knife to chip away at the rock but soon discovers that plan is completely ineffectual (adding to the tension is the scene where Ralston drops the knife and must retrieve it by attaching a bent wire and guiding it down to where the knife has fallen, by placing the wire between his toes).

Calling upon his survival skills, Ralston then designs an elaborate pulley system, hoping he'll be able to lift the rock, by using the weight of his body to move it. Finally, when that fails, he must concentrate on conserving the little water he has left, and figure out some other plan to extricate himself from his dire predicament. Boyle switches things up by introducing scenes in which Ralston begins hallucinating. In one such harrowing scene, after a cloud burst above in the desert, water cascades down into the crevice where Ralston is trapped, and he sees himself drowning. In another hallucinatory scene, Boyle introduces some comic relief by having Ralston imagine himself as a game show contestant, mocked by canned laughter due to his short-sightedness in failing to tell anyone where he was going.

As to the amputation itself, I was relieved it wasn't as gruesome as I had anticipated. Actually, it was more fascinating than terrifying. In an earlier scene, Ralston discovers that he is unable to sever his arm using his small dull knife. Later, however, he figures out that he must break his arm in two places and then use the plier part of his knife kit to literally grind and twist until he cuts off his arm.

As a result of this life changing event, Ralston has the epiphany that he had taken his family and friends for granted. Visions of the family and friends appear during the denouement and at the very end, Ralston himself, swimming in a pool, without his prosthesis, This of course suggests that the amputation has not squelched Ralston's love of the outdoors and taste for adventure. But one thing is for sure: when he takes a trip, he'll never again fail to tell those he is close to, where he is going.

The cinematography and the editing is superb here in both the expansive exterior shots and in the claustrophobic area where Franco maneuvers. True, '127 Hours' is basically a carbon copy of a true event, but Director Danny Boyle manages to take a story where we already know the ending and still made it gripping and compelling. That, of course, is no easy feat!",1298332800,6,4210,4.583001328021249
4243948,5,B0041KKYDI,"First off, I really get into these types of stories like you see in Animal Planet's ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" where a person or group of people is placed in a seemingly impossible situation to get out of, and have to somehow survive.  127 Hours is exactly this type of story and really delivers a power that will make you squirm.  Not a film you are likely to forget right away!  By the way, James Franco was terrific as pretty much the only character in the movie - a very tough role to play.

I've seen a lot of movies that go overboard with some complex and heavy-handed storyline where you just get lost amidst all the details, and it just becomes tedious.  127 Hours just goes to show that you can tell a gripping and effective story without all the bells and whistles.  Instead, we just have here a simple story of survival, and that can sometimes make for a more entertaining experience.  Sometimes less is more.",1298332800,,916,4.416666666666667
4243949,5,B0041KKYDI,"It's about time 127 Hours got the wide release (thanks to 6 Oscar nominations) it deserves, so today was the day I got to see what all the fuss was about.

I think everyone going to see the film knows the basic facts of this true story. Aron Ralston goes hiking, falls, has a giant boulder land on his arm, and in the end he has to resort to removing his arm with a dull pocket knife to allow for his escape.

Even more so than Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco is the movie. There is a brief scene before the fall when he meets two girls and there are a number of quick flashback and fantasy type sequences with other characters, but for the most part Franco is the only person on screen. I remember the days when almost everyone (including me) said this guy couldn't act. I'm talking about his role in the Spider-Man movies. The first time I noticed real acting talent was when he played the stoner in Pineapple Express. I'm here to tell you that this is the best performance by an actor I've seen in any movie released in 2010. I haven't seen The King's Speech yet, but Colin Firth will have his work cut out for him in my eyes. Into the Wild shows another character based on a real person and similar to the one Franco plays here, but rather than a kid who thinks he knows everything about survival and the wilderness, we sympathize and want this character to prevail, mostly thanks to James Franco's likeability in the role. He shows just about every range of emotion and I never for once thought I was watching anything other than the real person fighting for his life.

There are two things I didn't really care for. Danny Boyle's style of quick editing felt out of place at times and I could have done without some of the music choices.

Other than those minor negatives, 127 Hours is well paced, suspenseful, expertly acted, memorable and easily one of top 5 films of 2010.

If you like this movie or if it sounds like you would, check out the one man show that is Ryan Reynolds in Buried for nearly the same claustrophobic intensity. For the man surviving in nature aspect, check out Sean Penn's Into the Wild. They are not at the same level as this film, but both are still worthy of a rental for those with more than an ounce of patience.",1298160000,2,2253,4.31678486997636
4243950,5,B0041KKYDI,"Every year, hundreds of movies are released. Very few of these movies ever connect with me personally. 127 Hours is the first movie in a long time to make a special connection - I loved it - and while it is brilliant film-making, single people like myself are bound to take something more away from Danny Boyle's newest masterpiece.

Aron Ralston (portrayed brilliantly by James Franco) is a real individual, and this film is the story of 127 hours of his life - the 127 hours that changed him forever (both literally and figuratively). While hiking in Utah, a rock is wedged free and falls on his arm, pinning him in a deserted cavern far away from civilization. Without cell service, limited water, and options, Ralston must decide how much he wants to live, and how far he is willing to go to leave his fateful predicament. If you haven't heard of this story in the news, I won't spoil what happens. If you have heard, don't NOT see this movie because you think it will be too disgusting. Boyle has a way of making even the most horrid of moments emotionally moving - and you can always squint.

Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year - it would be the best if not for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-3-Four-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B003XKPPOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>. It's not just a movie about getting stuck and the will to survive. It's a film about how important life is, even when you live alone without many friends. Ralston lived almost in a state of auto-pilot - not caring where life took him, just wanting to get through it all. I'm not there personally, but some days - many days - I have come close. I would give this film a 9 out of 10 - see it.",1298160000,3,1806,4.841423948220065
4243951,4,B0041KKYDI,"I had no idea how Danny Boyle would manage to make the tale of a man trapped beneath a boulder for the better part of a week into an interesting feature-length, but the director did a nice job of shaking things up with flashbacks, hallucinations, dreams and inventive uses for the videotaped confessionals. Really, though, the whole movie boils down to the effectiveness of the eventual amputation, which was jarringly powerful and surprisingly effective. I may not have been able to identify with the dehydration, desperation and delusions of Aron Ralston's six-day struggle beforehand, but everything from the visuals to the sound effects of that climactic scene had me right there with him, feeling that sick, unsettling sensation in the pit of the stomach. That twenty minutes was gruesomely riveting. The rest of the film... tense, if not spectacular.",1297987200,,856,5.16546762589928
4243952,4,B0041KKYDI,"Now that I've had a few weeks to process director Danny Boyle's latest film, 127 Hours (2010), I can discuss it without the incredible emotional turmoil that I felt when leaving the theater after seeing this film. I can't really think of too many other films that have ""played"" with me emotionally like this one does, except maybe the first time I saw Dead Poets Society (1989) in the theater as a teenager. I felt completely exhausted and broken emotionally for a few hours after 127 Hours, not sure if I liked the movie or not! Definitely not an easy film to watch in my mind. And yet now, with at least as many hours as the title of the film under my belt, I feel I can safely say that this is one of the best movies of 2010. Having only seen it once in the theater, I'm going to give it an initial rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. My instincts are telling me that I may feel like its an even better film upon a second viewing, which I definitely intend to give it when it comes out on Blu-ray in a month. This is a movie that has a lot of emotional depth and filmmaking craft to it that needs time to swallow, and I wouldn't be surprised if it moves up in my ratings over the years. But we'll see...for now I'll stick with my initial analysis.

James Franco stars as Aron Ralston, the guy who this true story is inspired by. You might remember Ralston's story in the news back in 2003. Who wasn't shocked by the story of guy cutting off his own arm to save his life?! Definitely movie-making material in the right hands. There's no question in my mind that this is Franco's best work ever. Honestly, it had to be in order to make this movie even tolerable. I mean Franco is really all we have in the movie to keep our interest, and he does so very well. Franco's emotional roller-coaster ride of dealing with his arm being stuck under a rock is a feast to partake in. I was constantly wiping the tears away from my eyes as I went with him on this incredible journey, wondering if he was going to be able to do what he had to do...even though I knew he would. I will admit that this was a very hard movie to get through. While Franco is constantly looking at his watch in the movie, counting down the hours and days he's been stuck with his hand under a rock, I did the same in the theater. I found myself continually looking at my phone to see what time it was. I couldn't wait to get through this experience since it was so unbearable to watch and listen to as it builds to the expected climax. After the film, I thought more and more about how Danny Boyle probably intended that response from me, because the film definitely made me feel like I was stuck right there with Ralston, trying to get out. I mean we knew the outcome going in, so how do you engage your viewers? You make them feel on a very visceral level the same thoughts and emotions that Ralston felt while trapped under a rock. And I gotta give it to Boyle because I'm not sure too many other directors could've pulled it off at all, let alone as well as Boyle does here.

It's almost a given that the cinematography should be outstanding on a film set in the canyonlands of Utah...what with the famous desert southwest sky and golden lighting. Directors of Photography Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle absolutely aced their presentation of this wild and rugged landscape, presenting it in both classic compositions that the great landscape photographers of the 20th century have perfected (like Ansel Adams, David Muench, and Jack Dykinga), as well as with a fresh, hyperkinetic look and feel that gave the millions-of-years-old vistas a certain energy. I liked the contrast between the home video camcorder footage and the epic filmic look of the movie. Same with the contrast between the macro detail photography and the wide angle vast landscapes. The entire film was shot in digital, but it looks as good as film. I've experienced and photographed a lot of this landscape over my 20 years of living in Arizona and traveling throughout the southwest. And the photography in 127 Hours is about as good as it gets. No wonder I have so many still images from the trailers below!

Apparently the filmmakers created the canyon where Ralston is stuck for all these hours on a soundstage, since obviously it would have been hard to film on location. From my eye, I couldn't tell the difference between the set and the real landscapes. Production Designer Suttirat Anne Larlab and her entire art department team did a spectacular job making us feel like we were in a slot canyon in Utah. The scenes where the camera pulls out from what I assume is the set to the real landscape are seamless. I was even looking for evidence of the canyon not being real since I knew it wasn't, but couldn't find it! Everything designed in this film served the story perfectly and gave it a very real feel.

Music composer A.R. Rahman did a good job with the score and music selections for 127 Hours. I'm not quite as enamored with his work here as some, but I do think the music did a good job of helping tell the story and it's got a unique sound to it. There are actually quite a few very silent moments in the film with little or no music, and I think that actually worked well in the context of this story because it felt more real and helped emphasize the detailed sound effects of what Ralston is going through. As excruciating as they were to listen to at times. But again, it all served the story, and I have a feeling that on subsequent viewings when I know where the story is going and can prepare myself more emotionally, I may pay more attention to the integration of music in this movie. I've also got the soundtrack now and can listen to it on its own.

The film editing on 127 Hours, led by Jon Harris, is fantastic. This is a story where it could really get boring or fall apart quickly. Luckily, Harris always pulled me back into the story when I felt it was getting long-in-the-tooth, which is surprising for a 94-minute flick. But 127 Hours at times felt like the length of the movie, and not just the title. But Harris' energetic editing kept me looking at the situation in new interesting ways. I'm not all that impressed with the triptych presentation of three various shots playing side by side. I liked it at first towards the beginning of the film, but by the end, it felt overused. Still, I'll give Harris and Boyle credit for thinking outside the box with the editing and visual presentation of the film. They knew they needed to keep things interesting and they did their best to do that.

What Danny Boyle has done with 127 Hours is craft a very good story about how precious life is and how much we take it for granted each and every day. Ralston had no idea that when he went out for a day of biking and canyoneering in Southern Utah that he wouldn't be coming home with both arms intact. With his very being and psyche changed forever. What Ralston got from this painful life-changing experience is what we all crave to get at some point in our lives: meaning and purpose. Why are we here? What is our life for? What is important to us? Like so many of us, Ralston had to learn the hard way through trial and tribulation. Is there really any other way that we learn these lessons? We may not all lose a part of our physical body, but don't we all go through some sort of similar emotional experience at some point and see what's really real? Don't we discover at some point that this rat race modern lifestyle where we all run ragged keeping up with emails, texts, phone calls, and the buzz of the city, is not what's important? That there's something else out there for us to discover? Director Danny Boyle explores some very spiritual, emotional, philosophical, and psychological ideas in 127 Hours and he does it in a context where we, like Ralston, are trapped and forced to deal with those things. I can see why this film hasn't done as well at the box office as it should have. I was not exactly anxious to go see it either! It's a tough film to market and to get people to see. But if you make it through watching this movie, I promise there's something good on the other side. I don't know what it will be for you or when you'll get it. For me, it's hope. It's a reminder that I've been in situations, not that dissimilar from Ralston, off on my own hiking in the wilderness, with no real appreciation of the potential danger that comes with that. 127 Hours probably hit me so emotionally hard because I could relate to the story so strongly. And yet amongst and within all the risks of life are great rewards. Ralston risked his life, but got some incredible rewards in the end out of the tragic circumstances he precariously put himself in. I definitely now want to read his biography about the experience: Between A Rock and A Hard Place. So I can get a fuller picture of his personal experience.

If you can still find 127 Hours in the theater near you, go see it. Otherwise wait for the Blu-ray in a few weeks. Either way, this is a movie to be seen at least once just to get the experience, positive or negative. For me it was both.",1297900800,5,9131,4.37396937573616

From the sounds of it, it shouldn't work as a movie. There's no way a one man show with a man stuck in a crack being the focus of a whole movie can translate well.

But the shocking thing is, it does work. And surprisingly very well.

After his stellar Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle gives us this look into the mind of Aron Ralston. This movie has an interesting film style- with all the shots from inside his water bag, the split screens, the satirical talk show scene, etc.

James Franco is amazing in this flick. James Franco isn't James Franco in this movie... he really IS Aron Ralston. His emotions, facial expressions, mannerisms, etc. It was entirely believable, and he really is one-man show material. He manages to anchor the movie and make the one-man show entertaining.

4243955,3,B0041KKYDI,"It's not possible to see this film without having at least a high level knowledge of the plot.  That is, young man gets trapped by a rock while rock climbing in remote Utah.  The only way to escape is to cut off the offending limb.  This he eventually does and thus struggles his way to safety.

However, the above resume is absurdly simplified.  The film uses clever flashbacks together with an entrancing soundtrack to tell a compelling story.  The lead character, Aron Ralston (James Franco) is a very charismatic individual.  The viewer is drawn to him and when he becomes trapped, we are equally bound empathetically to the character.  This is no easy task for a film maker.

Yet, for all the skill of the director, there is only so much that can be brought to the screen.  It's an amazing tale but, somehow, it just falls short when seen on the big screen.  However, what does play well on the screen is the empty beauty of the stark southern Utah landscape.  This is stunning and helps to lift the story to greater heights than would otherwise be possible.

4243959,5,B0041KKYDI,"127 Hours is a 2010 film directed by Danny Boyle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001P9KR8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>).  He is making amazing and realistic films on tiny fractions of the budget it takes for any fat pompous producer's wallet to hock films about androids who turn into minivans, and he's winning the praise of his peers in doing so.  If I had Danny Boyle over for dinner I'll bet he could take my camcorder and create a ten minute short film that might be good enough for an Oscar nomination.  He's that good, and that's why he can take an inspirational story about real-life climber Aron Ralston, who in May of 2003 was forced to amputate his own arm to free himself from a boulder that had fallen on him, and make a movie out of it.  True that it's an inspirational story, but at the same time it's still a movie about a guy who is trapped suffering in a canyon for more than five days and eventually makes the decision to break his arm and slowly cut it off with a cheap jackknife.  On the surface it certainly doesn't seem to sound like a story a mainstream audience would want to sit through for 90 minutes, but if church groups can bring kids to see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B00028HBKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>, and mobs of kids can go see repeated glorification of humans potentially ending life on Earth, then you can see a movie about one guy who would do the unthinkable to talk to his mother and father again, to fix up a relationship with a woman he loved, to see his sister get married, and to hold his unborn son for the first time.  It is an enriching film about one man whose life was faced with a horrendous obstacle that smashed his hand and his whole life forever.  In the prime of Aron's life he very suddenly found himself staring death right in the face, and told death he was simply not ready.  There was no way this guy was going to die, not like this.  Boyle and his team should be praised for taking an effectually unfilmmable concept and turning into the best film of 2010.

127 Hours follows the true story of Raltson (play brilliantly by James Franco), an adventurous mountain climber and canyoneer, who has to save himself after a boulder traps his hand and him in an isolated canyon in Utah.  Throughout the next 127 hours Ralston assesses his life before the boulder fell on him.  He eventually musters the courage to amputate his arm, climb a 60 foot canyon wall, and tread for 8 miles before finally being rescued.  Be warned, it is as realistic an ordeal as you can imagine so the camera doesn't look away when he makes the difficult decision to leave his arm behind.

Obviously this is a film that simply would not work without a great casting choice followed by a truly great performance.  James Franco has, along with perhaps Natalie Portman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Swan/dp/B0041KKYEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Swan</a>, put together the best performance I've seen so far in 2010, which has been a very strong year, but I still have movies to see.  Franco more than deserves the praise he is getting.  It is another level displayed by this great young actor and if he doesn't win an Oscar for this, he will get his recognition in time.

In real-life Ralston has said the film is almost like a documentary of what happened to him.  I'm sure it was uncomfortable for him to watch, as it was certainly uncomfortable at times for me, but in the end the reward of life is worth it.  127 Hours really is a meditation on and a celebration of life.  I can only hope that if I were in that canyon I would have the courage to make such a decision and shame on me if I couldn't, given how fortunate I am to have the things I have.  Few films made in the last ten or so years had me pondering these kinds of things, and if I were to ask myself why I watch and love movies, I might say because I hope to find further reverence for life and the most powerful encouragement to live it fully.  This movie gets my highest recommendation.",1296518400,6,4381,4.987637362637362
4243960,4,B0041KKYDI,"When I heard that Danny Boyle, the director of films like ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""28 Days Later,"" and ""Trainspotting,"" was directing ""127 Hours,"" the film adaptation of Aron Ralston's first-person account of his entrapment under a boulder in a Utah ravine and subsequent escape by cutting off his own right forearm, I thought, ""What an odd choice to direct that movie."" Now, after having seen the brilliant ""127 Hours,"" I just can't imagine anyone else having directed the film. Boyle's jerky, spasmodic approach, tempered by long moments of stillness and reflection, paired with the superb music of A.R. Rahman (the same composer who provided ""Slumdog Millionaire"" with its unforgettable score), suits Ralston's story--and his character--perfectly. Of course, James Franco's tour de force performance as Ralston (it's not technically a one-man show, but Franco is alone onscreen for the vast majority of the film's 94 minutes) contributes greatly to the film's incredible impact. Boyle and Franco, faced with the challenge of creating drama and tension out of an event that almost everyone watching knows will happen eventually, pull off the task admirably--""the scene"" itself is almost impossible to watch, but somehow we must. By that point in the film, we have so much invested in Ralston's story that we simply have to see how it all happened. Ralston's triumph is so amazing, so remarkable, so inspirational that tears of joy (and yes, relief) will conquer the revulsion most viewers might experience as Ralston amputates his own arm in order to survive.

Are we to just assume that no one noticed that Ralston was missing?",1296345600,,459,5.0131578947368425
4243962,5,B0041KKYDI,"It's about time 127 Hours got the wide release (thanks to 6 Oscar nominations) it deserves, so today was the day I got to see what all the fuss was about.

I think everyone going to see the film knows the basic facts of this true story. Aron Ralston goes hiking, falls, has a giant boulder land on his arm, and in the end he has to resort to removing his arm with a dull pocket knife to allow for his escape.

Even more so than Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco is the movie. There is a brief scene before the fall when he meets two girls and there are a number of quick flashback and fantasy type sequences with other characters, but for the most part Franco is the only person on screen. I remember the days when almost everyone (including me) said this guy couldn't act. I'm talking about his role in the Spider-Man movies. The first time I noticed real acting talent was when he played the stoner in Pineapple Express. I'm here to tell you that this is the best performance by an actor I've seen in any movie released in 2010. I haven't seen The King's Speech yet, but Colin Firth will have his work cut out for him in my eyes. Into the Wild shows another character based on a real person and similar to the one Franco plays here, but rather than a kid who thinks he knows everything about survival and the wilderness, we sympathize and want this character to prevail, mostly thanks to James Franco's likeability in the role. He shows just about every range of emotion and I never for once thought I was watching anything other than the real person fighting for his life.

There are two things I didn't really care for. Danny Boyle's style of quick editing felt out of place at times and I could have done without some of the music choices.

Other than those minor negatives, 127 Hours is well paced, suspenseful, expertly acted, memorable and easily one of top 5 films of 2010.

If you like this movie or if it sounds like you would, check out the one man show that is Ryan Reynolds in Buried for nearly the same claustrophobic intensity. For the man surviving in nature aspect, check out Sean Penn's Into the Wild. They are not at the same level as this film, but both are still worthy of a rental for those with more than an ounce of patience.",1296259200,5,2253,4.31678486997636
4243963,5,B0041KKYDI,"In 2003 mountain-climber Aron Ralston went on a hiking trip in a desolate part of Utah without telling anyone where he was going. He became trapped at the bottom of a canyon when a boulder dislodged and pinned his right arm to a wall. Over the course of five days with little water, less food, and no hope of being found, Aron made a video diary documenting his ordeal while trying to sustain by any means necessary (including drinking his own urine). Eventually, in a moment of desperation, Aron was forced to amputate his arm with a dull knife in order to escape. Ralston is obviously a brave human being, who was faced with a dilemma in which many people would've chosen death. His act is a triumph of human determination and willpower and his story is brought to life by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle. 127 Hours is widely considered one of the best films of 2010 and recently received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. While complaints have been aimed at Aron's character (some people see his decision to not tell anyone where he was going ""stupid), the use of dream sequences/surreal imagery, and Boyle's hyperkinetic style; I found no issue with these aspects of the film. In fact, I've been so impressed by this film the two times I've seen it I can hardly find a negative thing to say about it.

Boyle and his co-writer Simon Beaufoy (the Oscar-winning scribe behind Boyle's previous film Slumdog Millionaire) stay faithful to Aron's ordeal and over the course of a riveting 90 minutes, Boyle shows us how powerful the will to survive can be. The success of the film hinges on the dynamite portrayal of Aron by James Franco. The film spends the first 15 minutes establishing Aron's thrill-seeking personality; his drive to Blue John Canyon in Utah, his encounter with two girls (Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara), and eventually the moment where he found himself in an unimaginable situation. From here, it's a one-man show for Franco. Aron has a watch, a video camera, a CD player, headphones, a flashlight, a rope and pulley, but almost no food and little water. Franco leads us through Aron's initial attempts to escape, his quiet acceptance of his fate, and his refusal to simply wait for death. Knowing the ending doesn't make the film any less suspenseful and the proceedings are nothing short of riveting.

Boyle tells this story in just 90 minutes, a perfect running-time that neither drags it out nor rushes it. In the hands of another director this could have been a snooze-fest, but Boyle has crafted a film that creates tension by perfectly capturing the claustrophobia of Aron's ordeal. While dream sequences/hallucinations are used, they don't clutter the story needlessly. They are necessary to establish Aron's personality and further the themes that Boyle and Beaufoy are trying to convey with their interpretation of Aron's story. It's not these images or his visual pizzazz that Boyle uses to carry the story, but his willingness to stay with Aron and allow James Franco to lead the audience through the story with his show-stopping performance.

The success of the film rests on Franco's shoulder and I couldn't spot the slightest misstep in his performance. Franco has to be interesting enough to hold your attention for over an hour, as well as making his character's journey believable. Through body language and tone of voice, Franco makes you believe you're watching an optimistic man slowly relinquish all hope before making one final decision in an attempt to save his own life. This is not a typical Oscar-bait performance, but a nuanced performance built on much subtlety. Spending the bulk of the film in a small space without the use of his right arm, Franco brings the audience right into that canyon with him. When the climactic scene arrives, you believe that Aron has reached this point of desperation. Had Franco made the smallest mistake in his performance, it could've brought the whole film down. I believe James Franco would win the Academy Award if not for Colin Firth as he delivers one of the most riveting and truly impressive screen performances of 2010.

One can't discuss this film without mentioning the climax, where Aron must finally take his fate into his own hands and amputate his arm. The scene is both realistic and horrifying, even more when one takes into account that this actually occurred. Rarely does a scene make me wince and recoil the way this scene did. It's brilliantly shot, acted, edited, and executed; graphic, but Boyle only shows as much as necessary relying on haunting sound effects and Franco to convey what's happening. It's a powerful, unforgettable scene.

127 Hours is an unforgettable experience that works on so many different levels. It's entertaining, exciting, intense, brilliant, and ultimately moving; a triumphant piece of filmmaking. It's much better than Boyle's Best Picture-winning Slumdog Millionaire (a film which has been widely forgotten) and is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2010. Having seen it twice now, it's still as suspenseful and powerful as it was the first time I watched it. While subsequent viewings and time may show some imperfections, it will remain the most intense movie-going experience I had in 2010.

4243966,3,B0041KKYDI,"Note: Certain Spoilers, but considering you probably have heard of this true story, this should be no surprise!

Slumdog Millionaire may be the most sentimental film that won the Best Picture Oscar in recent years, but it did turn Danny Boyle in a household name-for a director. Despite the great screenplay, and fabulous musical score, one must give some credit to Boyle for granting such steady pace to that film that may have lost its emotional side, and become an overly violent caricature of the slums, in the hands of another director. One must give him utmost respect for trying this after the worldwide success of that high budget award winner, considering how low-key and modest this is in scope.

This film is based on a true story that should not be unfamiliar for most westerners, or at least Americans. In 2003, the real Aaron Ralston actually experienced, and outlived this incident which is so conveniently presented in 2010 by Danny Boyle and James Franco, as Ralston. Aaron is an adventurer, a hiker, and an individualist who loves to appreciate the beauties of the Utah Desert all by himself.

This incident begins possibly like any of his other trips. He sets out alone, rides his bike near his destination, getting a few bruises on the way, and meets a few confused hikers, eventually leading to the BOULDER. His charisma shines in his conversation, and enthusiasm in reacting with the two female hikers, played by Amer Tamlyn and Rooney Mara. It is notable of his personality that Mara's character falls for him not due to any romantic gesture on his part, but his adventurous nature that pulls everyone in.

In the first thirty minutes, Aron has contact with humanity, from phone messages to his friendship with the girls, his 127 hours has yet to arrive. After his hand is caught, however, he loses all contact with humanity for the rest of the film-besides the closing minutes. The decision to make a film that centers on more than seventy minutes of literal isolation was a dangerous one. For this tactic to work, one needs to have a fascinating story, and an amazingly charismatic protagonist and performance. If not, this film can become a mind numbing study of a character that bores and irritates the viewer. Worst of all, if the protagonist is not engaging, we are stuck with him for 3/4 of the entirety of the film. As such, the character must be so appropriate as to work for this idiosyncratic idea.

Unfortunately, for more than a couple of reason, the delivery of Ralston's tale is not as smooth as it should be. Unfortunately, Boyle pushes the wrong buttons, engaging the audience excessively in the actual struggle, and makes Aaron's video recordings, dedicated to his family after his presumed death at this location, only an afterthought. Aron's actual struggle could be interested if the boulder did not confine his right hand so precisely that he has to spend day after day standing and leaning on the boulder.

In this position Aron can only try to free his hand to, obviously, no avail, and chip at it with a dull knife. Unfortunately, Boyle focuses on this for a large amount of the seventy minutes, showing his failure each day to pull himself free with the knife, and countless pulleys. It's admirable how hard he tries to escape with the methods at his disposal, but, unfortunately, Boyle focuses on these elements that are well after the third day, and shortchanges in other areas.

His recordings are fascinating, fueled by his regret that he did not tell anyone where he was going. It is filled with love for his parents, and his sister, and regret that he will not be able to attend his little sister's wedding. Considering how upbeat he is when recording these, addition of similar clips would have given the film a slightly optimistic and funny tone, without distracting the gravity of his situation. Boyle does the terminal crime of using a laugh track during one the funniest recording involving an imaginary phone call from another ""Aron."" There was no reason for this, as Franco exudes so much spirit in to this performance that we are grinning before the appearance of the laugh track, and when it does arrive, it seems as if the film developed in a melodrama.

It is a shame that Boyle covers his past by showing his previous relationships, his boyhood years, his sister on the piano, and glimpses of his parents. It's fine that we learn more about Aron, but the frank retelling of his past seems vastly intrusive and explicit. It would have much preferred if this was done in a form of ""confession,"" and recorded on the camera. It would more personal, emotional, and grant the ability to elaborate on each memory. For the reasons, this is not a captivating film, BUT a heart wrenching incident. We cannot blame Boyle for showing Aron in such a light, because this is an actual event-not Boyle's fictional tale open to liberty. However, there is a difference between a Discovery documentary on the incident, or a magazine or newspaper article, and a motion picture. Boyle either gives Aron's tale the wrong treatment, or this this incident is untranslatable to a film; however, my gut tells me the latter is possibly more valid. In its current form, 127 Hours is a powerful document of humanity's struggle for survival, but not necessarily a good film. Many films fall to this fate, most famously the original Godzilla film: Gojira. It, too, was a tremendous document of man's misuse of technology for warfare, but was a weak film with a dated, soggy, monster-even for its time. Aron's story does not necessarily need to divert from the facts, however Boyle's version fails with the straight forward factual approach.

James Franco performance has been singled out, and he is bound to be nominated for an Oscar considering the hype surrounding the film as of now. My major concern with the performance is that it is too isolated, and one-note. Let us analyze what Franco does in this film: He tries to free his hand by brute force, he stabs that damn flesh, he amputates it, he records his thought while stuck on the boulder, daydreams, and reminisces about the past. All of these occur while he is the ""prisoner"" of the boulder. Franco often plays it better than accepted, but this character has not much to offer us, due to his condition. There is the occasional groan and laugh from Aron, but he is isolated, and after a few days he is just too drained to offer the audience any insight in to his life. He is ready for death, and he just sees no possible path to survival. Franco embodies Aron pretty well, yet the character is too two dimensional, allowing Franco little ingenuity. The issue is that he cannot be three dimensional, for his lack of communication with any outside source. Even Tom Hanks in Cast Away was able to interact with his environment, and especially the ball, ""Wilson."" As good as Franco is in this film, Boyle needed a more charismatic and subtle comedic actor. Even in interviews, Franco shows himself to be overly shy, and this shows here where Aron is unable to utilize the segments he records for his family. Someone like Jake Gyllenhaal would have done much better in these scenes, and would have allowed Boyle to make these scenes insightful. Franco is fine, but Aron's 127 hour imprisonment leaves him unable to leave a significant impression. Sure, the amputation scene is horrifying, but what does Franco do afterwards than scream his balls off? Then again, what could anyone else add to this scene?

127 Hours conclusion may seem bittersweet, yet it is euphoric because he escaped that damned condition. He lost part of his hand, gaining much more: The ability to live, witness his sister's wedding, and finally tell his parents of his love for them. Overall, this film depends on the endurance of the viewer to understand that the main stars of this film are Aron, his ""imprisoned and eventually amputated hand, and a ""cruel"" boulder. If they can live with more than eighty minutes of watching Franco and this boulder fight till one victors over the other, this may be the film for them.",1294358400,9,8085,4.772694781987133
4243967,4,B0041KKYDI,"I think there is inherent in mountain climbers and outdoor thrill seekers a certain degree of arrogance. To subject yourself to extreme environmental conditions and believe that you're capable of taking them on requires a great deal of confidence, if not something of a superiority complex. I say this as someone who has never scaled a mountain and has absolutely no intention of ever doing so; perhaps it's coming from a place of jealousy, since being unwilling to take a risk has not allowed me to live life to the fullest. But then again, I can't help it if I find the indoors far more comfortable and a whole lot safer. And I'm certainly not the kind of person that wants to risk life and limb simply for the sake of challenging myself and/or feeling an adrenaline rush.

On the basis of his life, there can be no doubt that Aron Ralston is such a person. In 2002, he quit his mechanical engineering position at Intel to fully devote himself to a project that began in 1998: Scaling solo all fifty-three of Colorado's 14,000-foot peaks. He became the first person to achieve this goal in 2005. In 2008, he climbed Argentina's Ojos de Salado and Monte Pissis. That same year, he climbed Alaska's Mount McKinley and actually skied down from its summit, which is more than 20,000 feet high. In 2009, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Given this track record, it should come as no surprise that he someday plans to scale Mount Everest.

His most publicized expedition was in April of 2003. While hiking Blue John Canyon in Moab, Utah, he slipped and fell into a crevice, causing a dislodged boulder to pin his right arm against the canyon wall; five days later, facing dehydration and delirium, he was forced to sever his arm below the elbow with a dull pocket knife. He would later write about this experience in his autobiography ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"" which would soon become a ""New York Times"" bestseller. This means, of course, that every one of Ralston's post-2003 expeditions were literally done single handedly. I have to admit, I truly don't understand this mindset. After such a traumatic experience, how on earth would anyone be able to even look at a rock formation, let alone scale it?

Ralston's 2003 accident has found its way into the hands of director Danny Boyle and been turned into the film ""127 Hours,"" an intense and shocking but also life-affirming man-against-nature drama. Ralston is portrayed by James Franco, who, like Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan,"" pushes himself to the very limits of physical and psychological endurance. It's an amazing performance, especially since the entire film is basically a one-man show. We watch with helpless fascination as he struggles, not only against the boulder pinning his arm, but also against hunger, dehydration, and insanity, his mind often giving way to vivid daydreams and disturbing insights. We also watch as he tries to keep a level head and work with whatever tools he has at his disposal.

Intertwined with his ordeal are harsh but cleansing periods of confession and self criticism, which he makes into video testimonials on his digital camcorder. One of the film's best scenes is when he imagines he's a guest on a talk show. Boyle doesn't go for the obvious and show him in a fully furnished TV studio; he instead shows Ralston exactly as he is in the canyon. We do, however, hear a phantom audience, who are perfectly timed to Ralston as he vocally shifts back and forth between himself and the loud-mouthed host. In that imaginary interview, we learn that Ralston never left a note saying where he was going, which means no one would know where to look once they realized he was missing. Why would he be that careless? Because he thought he could be a hero. Ah, but as Gordon Lightfoot once observed, heroes often fail.

He also uses the camcorder to film his goodbyes to his family and friends. He's especially sorry to his mother; he regrets the day the let the answering machine take her phone call, even though he was home at the time. He also regrets the way he handled his relationship with his girlfriend, Rana (Clmence Posy), who said on their last date that he would be awfully lonely someday.

It goes without saying that the arm severing scene is difficult to sit through. I've seen horror movies in which people are hacked to bits and blood sprays everywhere, and I don't even blink; watching the final scenes of ""127 Hours,"" I squirmed in my seat, squinted my eyes, gritted my teeth, and just wanted the whole thing to be done and over with. Amazing how audiences can react so differently, depending on the context. Boyle does an amazing job of depicting the genuine horror of the situation. He doesn't shy away from it, and yet he captures it in such a way that it seems neither gory nor exploitive. It's a real moment in the life of a real person. His greatest accomplishment, however, was making me thankful for the things I take for granted on a daily basis, like access to food and water. And yes, even the love of my family.",1293753600,2,5032,4.693091732729332
4243968,3,B0041KKYDI,Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire back in 2008 swept the Oscars by winning a good amount of the awards..was Slumdog Millionaire worthy of all its praise and wins..no not even close. Slumdog Millionaire is an average film at best but Danny Boyle's 127 Hours is a much better film then his previous efforts..by now mostly everyone should know about the true events that this film is based on..so there is no need for me to go into great detail about that. 127 Hours is an interesting film about the strong will of the human mind and soul..about how much one man will do to survive..The film sports beautiful scenery and quick editing that is quite effective in the narrative of the story..James Franco gives a strong performance as the frantic hero..127 hours didn't blow me away by any means..its a solid film that is quite good but its not extraordinary..it didn't captivate me like Inception and Deathly Hallows did. James Franco will most likely get an oscar nomination for his performance in 127 Hours..personally I haven't seen a performance from an actor/actress this year that I believe is Oscar material but never the less he will be nominated..if anything else 127 Hours is better then the majority of the mind numbing nonsense that is currently being released in American theaters..so that's worth something in itself I suppose.,1293062400,3,1337,4.920353982300885
4243969,4,B0041KKYDI,"I saw this movie yesterday and have to say that it is one of the great movies of the year.  This is no surprise when you learn that Danny Boyle was the Director and Producer as Slumdog Millionaire was great as well.  This is the story as many folks know about a man who was (is) an avid hiker and mountaineer and is out one day climbing and hiking and gets trapped by a boulder. The only way to get out ended up being to saw his arm off and walk out.  The movie is not for anyone who is squeamish but I have to say that even those parts were done in a realistic but sensitive way.  The fact that he was able to survive and get out and make it back and even more importantly go on with his life as a climber and mountaineer is amazing.  I think it is hard to say ""if he can do it I can do it"" because to be honest I hardly know anyone who truly can say they can do this.  Who really do you know who can saw off their own arm with a pocketknife?  But the movie itself was great, likely will win some awards, and I highly recommend it.",1292976000,8,1032,3.839622641509434
