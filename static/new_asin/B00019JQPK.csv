1982439,5,B00019JQPK,"Marmalade Boy is a synonym for ""crack"" in shoujo anime.  Tokyopop is releasing this astounding series in 4 sets of 19 episodes each - the only problem being that the other 3 sets aren't out yet!
Marmalade Boy, for a show with a silly title, deals with an insanely tangled web of characters and characterization, with an odd sort of love pentagon that forms.  It follows Wataru Yoshizumi's excellent manga fairly well, taking rather obvious liberties as well as its sweet time (76 episodes from only 8 volumes!).  As we follow convoluted affairs of the heart, centering around the unassuming but pretty Miki Koishikawa, whose parents swap with those of Yuu Matsuura.  As something starts to develop between Miki and Yuu, her old crush Ginta Suou comes into the picture - as does Arimi Suzuki, Yuu's ex-girlfriend.  Their rivalries are part of the addictive soap-opera antics, but it's Marmalade Boy's ability to do an early subplot involving Miki's best friend Meiko that really sets this first set above and beyond the average shoujo anime.
Marmalade Boy's animation is older and not up to par with many series from the TV boom that really got started in Japan in 1995 (MB started airing in 1994).  However, it generally takes a more mature outlook even when it ""goes shoujo"" - aside from the occasional pastel recoloring or change from realistic to emotionalistic background, MB isn't so big on the major cliches of its genre.  It's a fairly remarkable series for what it is, and if you're at all a fan of shoujo anime, this is essential at any cost.",1083456000,7,1551,4.786516853932584
1982440,5,B00019JQPK,"Marmalade Boy is one of those animes that preserve the ideas of simplicity within human relationships without the need for fantasy and magical elements, something that seems almost long forgotten.  While these elements are used to keep the enjoyment of the anime high, Marmalade Boy is one of those shows that does not need any of that to keep the audience glued to the TV.
A little bit about the story: Marmalade Boy spans 76 episodes and a short movie that acts as a prologue to the series.  The protagonist of Marmalade Boy is Miki Koishikawa (making this a shoujo anime, an anime for girls - centered on relationships and emotions).  Her thoughts that she had a normal life were now shattered as her parents return home from a vacation with plans to divorce and remarry with a couple, the Matsuuras, they had met.  Miki makes it her goal to prevent this from happening, and all this happens while she has to deal with feelings for boys at school and for the Matsuura's son.  Although Marmalade Boy centers around Miki, there are many other characters that have their own depth, personalities, and stories of love and the drama that comes with it.
Tokyo Pop puts out a good release with this.  The video and audio quality is very nice for an older show.  Putting out releases in smaller box sets of 19 episodes each was a good idea.  With this being a much longer series than most, this makes it easier for people to get and enjoy the series without having to wait for individual volumes.
Final Note: I am extremely happy that Tokyo Pop has taken the effort to release a series that many feared would never be licensed.  Along with this was Hana Yori Dango (Boys over Flowers) in terms of older, but amazing series with great stories.  With the present anime and looking into the future, it seems we are forgetting the simplicity of stories and of human relationships that can be evocated easily and beautifully without the need to complicate it with other factors.",1083456000,25,1968,4.629310344827586

1982442,5,B00019JQPK,"Marmalade Boy is one of the best anime I have ever seen in a long time! If you are looking for a romantic comedy this is the one I recommend the most! One of the reasons why I love this anime so much is because of the lovable characters and the music! The music been carefully chosen and it's terrific!
One of the main characters is Miki Koishikawa.  She is the average high school student with a normal life...well...until her ryoshin (parents) states out of the blue and says they're getting divorce. Her parents explained that they're going to switch partners with another married couple (the Matsuuras).  How much stranger can it get?
One other major character is Yuu Matsuura.  He has the looks, brains and for his personality....somewhat cold.  His character is so mysterious and likeable!  There were times when I just wanted to jump into the tv and just....scream at the guy!
The story is like a teenager's soap opera! It also focuses on Miki's friends.  The obstacles that they all have to go through.
I have seen this series so many times and it made me laugh, angry and had me in tears (when I was still in my teens). Another reason I love this series is because I could relate to some of Miki's problems.  It's tremedously a wonderful shoujo anime!  Another recommendation is to the read the manga  because it's more in depth!  Wataru Yoshizumi-sensei has really done a wonderful job!",1083024000,7,1396,4.638211382113822
1982443,4,B00019JQPK,"That's what the creative people dubbing Marmalade Boy at TokyoPop are calling it anyway.  Check it out at their webpage.  I have seen all the ""underground"" fan-subtitled episodes for this series so I can already say that this is a good anime (but I have to hold back one star because I haven't seen the dub yet).  I've seen TokyoPop's sneak peak for this and I have to say I am pleased with what I've heard and seen so far. The voice actor for Yuu in the dub is more his age; in the manga, vol. 6's (pg. 47-check it out) Free Talk, Wataru Yoshizumi admits that she thought that Ryutaro Okiayu (Yuu's voice actor) had a deep, sexy voice and maybe it was too sexy and mature for his character (even her boss thought that).  I have heard his voice in the fan-subs and in some ""character songs"", and they are right--it is deep and sexy.  The voice actor's voice for Yuu, from what I've heard in the sneak peak, seems to embody the youth, vibrancy, mischievousness, kindness, and gentleness that are part of Yuu's personality.  I think even Wataru would approve of his voice. I love the voice for Miki.  Perfect!  If you are a romantic, like shojo (manga that deals with relationships and the human heart), or like soap operas (as my brother called this series when my sister and I were watching it), then I have no doubt that you will enjoy this series!  The manga is just as wonderful.  The art in it is beautiful and clean.  I highly recommend it!",1082851200,2,1445,4.394736842105263
1982444,5,B00019JQPK,"...That is, if I can. That is, if it's possible.
Plotting a diagram of the relationships that are traced and followed throughout this fantastic shoujo soap-style manga is quite a challenge. It's almost laughable, but this story is simply about young people and their daily lives and relationships. No giant mecha, no magical girls, no 'let's save the world before dinner time'. None of the usual anime fare, really. Yet the manga gets the last laugh, because you'll be hooked before you know it.
Miki wishes her life were more interesting, and her wish comes true when her parents suddenly announce that they are getting a divorce, and switching partners with another couple for a remarriage.
Miki is shocked and upset, but then she meets Yuu, the son of the other couple. Yuu is good looking, polite and fun, and Miki soon starts wondering what her feelings for her new 'brother' are... Meanwhile, Miki's best friend Ginta is trying to find a way to tell her he loves her, Yuu's ex-girlfriend returns with the intention of getting Yuu back, and Miki's friend Meiko has some heavy issues of her own.
It sounds like a soap opera, and in a lot of ways it is, but without being repetitive and throwaway viewing- it's far more addictive and well-plotted than that, with lots of twists and turns to the story to keep you interested and enthused.
I think a lot of my love for this series comes from its ultimate realism and undeniable cuteness. It's well-nigh impossible not to fall in love with these people- you soon forget that they're characters, and I was sure Wataru Yoshizumi, the creator of the manga of this series, had been to my high school and decided to put everyone I knew into this series. As you watch it, you just can't shake off the feeling that you've met all of these people before. I guess that's just because they're so realistic. The only thing about this series that isn't perfect is the animation, which isn't what you'll expect if you're used to anime like Inu-yasha or Full Metal Panic. However, I think it's still good and really cute.
As for the cuteness... *chibi grin* There's a unique delight to be had from watching the destined couples slowly but surely realise their feelings for each other, and finally get together. Don't underestimate this story's ability to have you alternately squealing with delight and clenching your fists with anticipation.
Fun, easy, involving, surprisingly touching: a darn good watch. You'll be crying 'kawaii' before you know it. ^_^",1075248000,15,2492,4.797674418604651
1982445,4,B00019JQPK,"wow this is an awsome anime. if you liked the manga i think that you will enjoy the anime more. its about two families remarrying to each other and they each have a kid the same age, miki and yuu, who fall in love and hide it from their parents. the manga is really serious and dramatic sometimes, whereas the series is more lighthearted and funny. its VERY shoujo. its cute. the animation is typical '95 tv series type but its still pretty good. i gave it 4 stars because this is like REALLY expensive for a set. you can get the whole series subbed for this much at ddd.... yeah.... but this is still a much cooler cover than the ddd one so im still gonna buy this.",1073174400,,666,4.170542635658915
1982469,5,B00019JQPK,"Marmalade Boy is a great anime. The relationships are well developed and the characters are likable. Miki is a great girl and so is her best friend Meiko. I wanted them to be happy so bad it drove me crazy when all those other guys tried to sabotage their relationships. I didn't ever understand the appeal of Yuu though. He's supposed to be handsome and relatively athletic, but other than that I think he's kind of uninteresting. I guess its good that I'm not too fond of him. Since I'm a guy and all. But he is good to Miki so I can overlook his lack of appeal. The series is simply fantastic. All 4 scrapbooks come in english contrary to some reviews. I have all 4 of them. The only complaint I have is that scrapbook 3 is rare and priced at around $200 dollars if you want to buy it. I lucked out and got it cheaper. If you want to watch a great teenage romance anime Marmalade Boy is perfect for you.",1351296000,,906,4.182857142857143
1982470,5,B00019JQPK,"Let's face something here, something that fans might not like to face: Marmalade Boy is not exactly a work of art. Okay, let's generalize less; it's a feel-good piece of fluff that has very little substance and whose only entertainment value is in seeing how far one can stretch relationship troubles. But, despite that, I love it anyway, and Volume 1 showcases why exactly that is.

Yes, the characters are cliche. Yes, the plotlines are often ridiculous. Yes, the animation isn't exactly the strongest example of this anime era. But you know what? The writing's tight (again, with it's moments), and you can't help but love the cliches anyway. As well as one of the best (and one of the only) positive and semi-realistic handlings of a student-teacher relationship (and if that needs spoilers, you have no idea what you're buying, do you?)

The extras for this version are pretty good; a few episodes worth of commentary (I would have liked every-episode commentary, but in a series this long, that's impractical enough to be forgive), an interview with the character designer, and a nice little picture card that presumably fits in with the ones in future boxes. And it all comes cased in a beautiful container that you will probably never show off for fear of screams of ""What the frick is this?"" from your family.

Overall, if you're a fan, I highly recommend this, you sad, sad person. ;)

Overall Score: 5/5",1277683200,4,1414,4.806584362139918
1982471,5,B00019JQPK,"What would you do if your parents divorced and switched partners with another couple and live in the same house together? Ask Miki Koshikawa, a junior at Toryo High School. When Miki parents announce that they and their friends the Matsuras, a couple they met in Hawaii, have decided to divorce, switch partners, remarry, and live together; it upset Miki. During this, Miki meets the Matsuras' son Yuu. Yuu has a mischievous sense of humor, but has a warm, gentle nature. Miki and Yuu find themselves falling in love with each other, despite being step-siblings. Ginta, one of Miki's classmates, and Arimi, Yuu's ex-girlfriend, become upset about the relationship and pretend to date to make Miki jealous. The pretend dating infuriates Ginta's obnoxious cousin Tsutomu, who adores Arimi and hates Yuu and sees Ginta as a rival for Arimi. Miki's best friend, Meiko, tries her best to support her and give her advice while dodging the attentions of student body president Satoshi and having a secret romance with one of her teachers. If you like comedy, drama, romance, and suspense all rolled into one, then you will like this show. I did.",1226793600,,1138,4.932291666666667
1982472,5,B00019JQPK,"I'm not going into the plot anymore since other reviewers have already done that. And I definitely do not agree with that other reviewer, Razor Queen(Witch Hunter) and H. Stewart. As mentioned in my title, if you are a romantic at heart and you like those soap opera-ish -plot, then you will like this. Now if you're some cold hearted, jaded, cynical person - maybe not.

Obviously this anime is geared towards girls - it is shoujo. And of course the animation seem oldish, its been years since this was first released. However, the characters, story, and plot are all very entertaining and interesting. I think at one point or another girls experienced all the emotions, stages and thoughts that the female characters of the show feel so they can really do relate. I don't think the plot or the characters are impossible at all. I'm in my upper 20's and I watched this back when I was about 17/18. I'm rewatching it right now and I STILL love it.

After watching the all of the first boxset in dub, I can say that Miki's english voice actress seemingly was able to capture the spirit and ""genki-ness""; Yuu and Ginta at first I wasn't sure but after a few episodes they both sound good;  Meiko does sound all calm and peaceful so that's fine. Arimi on the other hand though, I'm not really sure. There doesn't seem to be much passion/life in her voice. The rest of the cast were all fine - at least to me, I was able to tolerate it so it must have been fine with me. Of course, I'll always prefer the actual Japanese voice actors but I think English dub sounds alright save for the few comments above. And the music is TRULY lovely.

I actually bought all four boxset dvds. And thank goodness I was able to get them. Looks like they will be out of print forever =( And even if they do get released again, who knows how much the new company will charge?! I think Tokyopop did a great job with all four boxsets. My only complaint is that there didn't seem too many extra goodies on the dvds. A few discs had outtakes and a few character profiles but that was pretty much it. I wish they'd put more, like more Marmalade Boy pictures/collages or even Japanese voice actors specials, etc. But either way, I'm still happy they released the boxsets.

The 1st boxset came with a mini pencilboard - yay! The boxset itself is sturdy. Inside the box is another sturdy box that opens and up and all the dvds are there. The boxset and whats inside has pictures of different scenes/snapshots of events in the show. There is also a leaflet inside with translations, etc.

The animes I've watched and liked, are obviously this one, Fushigi Yuugi, Boys Over Flowers, Juuni Kokki, Naruto, Rurouni Kenshin, Death Note, Koi Kaze and mannnny more! Bottomline: I LOVE THIS ANIME!",1210291200,,2757,4.504
1982473,5,B00019JQPK,"Marmalade Boy is a great series and a must-see for fans of romance/comedy anime. The characters are unique, real, and endearing;even the antagonists are likable. The story is light-hearted and funny but also has a good deal of drama. The fact that relationships progress throughout this series is something that sets Marmalade Boy apart from many others. Although the last fifteen or so episodes are hard to get through (lots of angst), the ending is well worth the wait.",1196035200,,471,4.974683544303797

I mean, it's kinda not that well drawn in the first DVD, but it gets better. I thought the anime Miki was more whiny than the manga Miki. The anime expands the plots and makes it pretty fun to watch. Though there were some slow parts that I thought took away from the original, but then again, it's based on the manga, not taken directly word for word, scene for scene.

I am saving up money to get the other 3 DVD volumes. It's a definite on my list of things to get and watch.",1154736000,,614,3.991869918699187
1982476,5,B00019JQPK,"I was 17 when I first saw a few episodes of Marmalade Boy.  At the time, I was turned off by a couple of things, namely the seemingly exaggerated romance and character design (I, like some reviewers before me, thought the characters were elongated).  Also, I found the protagonist Miki to be annoying back then...  And Yuu?  Well, I didn't exactly find him to be special.  To be frank, I didn't like this show at all when I was 17.  I saw some random episodes and refused to watch any more of it.  In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd say I pretty much detested the show back then.  I didn't understand why anyone would waste his/her time watching Marmalade Boy.

BUT, perhaps, I didn't know better when I was 17.  I essentially judged Marmalade Boy on superficial factors and failed to notice what makes it truly appealing.  In fact, when I saw this show in its entirety at 22, I finally came to appreciate it.

Where did the difference lie?  Well, for me, it was clearly personal experience that changed my feelings toward Marmalade Boy.  When I was 17, I didn't know what love was.  I didn't understand how anyone could get so emotional over someone they like and things of the sort.  However, at 22, I had experienced all the ups and downs of loving someone, and on seeing the show, I realized that I could relate exactly to what most of the characters were going through.  In fact, I think Marmalade Boy's strongest point is the well-designed (and easy-to-relate to) characters.  I know that some people have labeled Yuu as a ""pansy"" and so on just because he prefers to keep things to himself.  However, I know a lot of guys in real life who do the same thing, and watching this show actually helped me understand how they feel (generally speaking, most guys of this personality type are really sweet and sentimental).  Actually, I'd say that Marmalade Boy's characters are fairly realistic in terms of personality and emotions.  Yuu's and Miki's parents are probably the only characters that are somewhat out of sync with reality, but hey, they excel at providing comic relief.  ^^

All in all, Marmalade Boy was an emotional ride for me, and I loved every minute of its simplicity and sweetness. And no, I'm not a little girl, and last time I checked, my brain was full of things other than cherry blossom petals (in fact, it's overloaded with marketing concepts as that's my field of study).  Anyway, I highly recommend this series to shoujo fans.  However, for those of you who place heavy weight on animation quality and character design as I did when I was 17 (or are looking for a series with an intricate storyline), then this show probably isn't for you.",1147132800,4,2674,4.578947368421052

1982488,5,B00019JQPK,"OK, this was the first anime that I bought in bulk--all four of the collections.  It was great as it stood; fairly comic and fairly soap-opera-esque, but I'll leave most of the comments about the content to the better-qualified commentators here.

What I can't resist about this series is the American voice actors' commentary.  It's not to all people's tastes, but, frankly, the funniest thing in anime (even funnier than Excel Saga or Lupin III or pretty much anything) is the commentary.  I've got about five hundred anime DVDs, and I listen to commentary all the time, and these folks just tee off on the content.  The sheer irreverancy and joy they have in the comments would make this worth watching even if you wanted to only see what the voice actors said afterwards.

Having said that, Marmalade Boy is a definite must-see.  It's one of the top five animes that I can think of, and it does stand by itself.  Having said that as well, I typed this to give a shout-out to the hilarious commentary.",1125187200,2,1004,4.632768361581921

I bought it and started watching it. Of course it was great, except... But don't be fooled, even though you love the manga, the voices from the people that they portray is nothing like those of in Marmalade Boy. When you read any manga, you use a special voice for each different character, so when you start watching it on DVD, the characters voice is nothing like the one you had in mind. The voices used aren't as great as they should be, but the movie in general is great. You'll be in for a treat as this off the charter series is incredible.",1122854400,,695,4.155555555555556

After all, excepting something that isn't normal as an operating truth is kind of the point.  I think this series trys to show how easy it is to get confused by emotions.  Also, this series made me laugh out loud quite a bit.  Although I must admit that I just didn't care about the characters as much as the ones in series like ""His and Her Circumstances"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Boys Over Flowers"", or ""Fruit Basket"".

1982492,5,B00019JQPK,"This Anime rocks!!!!! I think that ""Razor Queen"" Is a complete and total idiot!!!! I understand that not ALL minds are the same,and that you were 8 when it came out,but that gives you NO right to  attack other reviewers,they are just excersizing thier freedom of speech,and they didn't call you a ""Moron,dimwit,or immature"" like you referred E.Wilson,and MBstr215(mostly MBstr215) to,so I won't stoop down to your level and go on about how you wrote the same review twice,(""The Stone Cold Truth,and ""You sholdent even be considering this...),in which both are almost EXACTLY identical.

But to change the subject,Marmalade Boy is a amusing story (with a GREAT soundtrack),about the romantic and somewhat comical trama of Miki Koishikawa. The story starts out in Miki's kitchen when  her immature parents break the ghastly news to her that they are divorcing,swaping spouses with another couple,and living under one roof. Miki now has four parents,and a really cute stepbrother Yuu. Even though he has a bit of a cold demeanor towards Miki, he also has a bit of sweetness in his personality ,""A Marmalade Boy-Perfect,isn't it?"",As to quote Miki,on the morning after the kiss in the infirmary (That famous scene).As Miki begins to know Yuu,she forms a crush on him.

  But as their love starts to blossom, they realize that they have many obsticals to hurdle. From Arimi,a former girlfriend of Yuu,who is still in love with him,and wants Yuu back,to Rokutanda,(Who in my opinion,doesn't really seem as much of a threat).And we can't forget Satoshi Miwa,the playboy student body president who everyone belived to have a affair with Yuu,and cause much doubt between Miki and Yuu as tears were shed,and secrets were heald concealed. Then you can't forget hotheaded Ginta,(Who I failed to mention earlier)whom of which was the object of Miki's affections in Jr. High and still loves Miki,even though she confessed her love for him 2 years ago ,and he rejected her,ever though he liked her then too... Then you have the whole crisis with Meiko and Namura-sensei (Nachan),which Miki then realizes which person is the one for her....

Even though I have read all 8 volumes of the manga,and seen all of season 1 and 2,I don't want to go on about the story because it would ruin the story for all those who are reading my review. I would also like to add that this is a wonderful anime/manga DVD full of hours of tears,laughter,bazarre love triangles,and cool behind-the-scenes looks at the Japanese-to-English dubbing done by Tokyopop.",1100304000,,2525,5.026315789473684

I started watching marmalade boy when I was eight years old. I adored it. Completely hooked is an understatement. I taped every episode and even made addicts out of a couple of friends. I got all the manga (yes, it was published and aired in Spain a long time ago) and bought the soundtracks.

The reason for all of this?

An eight year old doesn't know any better.

You want a real review of marmalade boy, here it is:
Lets start off with the title shall we? Marmalade boy sounds quite appetizing does it not? Well the feeling ends after the credits have stopped rolling. Exchanging partners is the most normal thing in the world. If they can exchange with another married couple with a cute son included thats a bonus I guess. This anime should have been called `six people get it on'. Your mother gets it on with my farther, my mother gets it on with your farther. And us, since we love each other so much, should get it on as well. That's the animes premise. Well lets start on the characters, miki koishikawa (typical shoujo protagonist) and yuu matsura (another calcium kid). The sun and the moon. She speaks off the top of her head, he doesn't know how to open his mouth. She's kind, him...well, a bit of a pansy. She is quite courageous and tries to get things sorted, and he (a lot of poor me syndrome) prefers to suffer in silence...and kisses miki while she is sleeping (so she doesn't find out he like her, bla!). In a nutshell, they are complete opposites of each other. Come on, with a guy like this your libido goes to hell.

The plot?

Miki: should I stay with yuu? Or ginta? With keikun?...ohhhh I've got such problems!
We also have ginta suou, a hot head who always speaks his mind. And lets not forget the fountain of tears and mikis best friend, meiko akizuki. She's intelligent, comprehensive, is loaded and reminds you of a thoroughbred horse, as miwa satoshi would say. Ahh satoshi, promiscuous...err, no, not in the end. But I haven't finished with meiko yet. Quite a perfect girl...what is she doing having a secret relationship with her teacher? (Not that I find anything wrong with that) She could have the whole football team but no, she prefers a teacher. (There is no reason why a mature and intelligent girl prefers a cultured gentleman then a band of stupid boys whose only interests are video games and sports). This series deals with relationships between a teacher and a student 12 years his junior, guys that don't know if they are gay, incestuous relationships (miki and yuu still decide to be together even after they find out that they are brother and sister), parents the are more immature then there own children...

Whose fault is this?

Well its wataru yoshizumis', the creator of this pile of crap. But by the way that's not her real name, it's her pen name. Yes the poor girl would be accosted by rabid fans and angry mobs if she gave her real name away. Or perhaps she is just too ashamed to admit that she is the creator of this so-called masterpiece. This woman also has a passion for tennis. The problem is she sucks at it so she decided to become a mangaka(no comment), and so now she always finds ways to insert tennis games into her mangas. At least one of the main characters has to play tennis. This woman has some fierce resentment. She also seems to resent the character of satoshi miwa, who is the only one the end up with no partner. He probably ended up with some guy. We all know that he's a closet gay right? This woman is cruel.

So, can we blame wataru yoshizumi for this failure of this anime? Perhaps we should blame the viewers. Those hysterical pre pubescent girls that love yuu (my god they have bad taste).

The animation quality?

Walking sticks that talk and fall in love. It doesn't give a very good impression to the maturing youth of today, who believe that anorexia is the sign of beauty. To put it bluntly the animation quality is terrible, however it seems to improve in the last season.

Marmalade boy isn't a good anime (is it a good anything?). The drama plays out like a bad Latin-American soap opera. This...thing that I am reviewing shouldn't be branded with the title of an excellent shoujo and has no point in its favour.

The creator should...dissapear somewhere and do the world a favour of never coming back and creating any more crap.
The series is...suitable for little girls, whose brains are full of cherry blossom petals.
PS: This is a message to the two ladies above who have both called me an idiot for disliking marmalade boy. To E.Wilson, I will say first of all that I am a girl, secondly I have watched the show in its entirety multiple times and when I did watch it I didn't realise how dumb it was because I was 8 and lastly you sound like you would bash anyone whos opinion differs from your own. To MBstr215, who asks: `why did she watch it when she was eight years old?' The answer is that's how old I was when it came on TV you moron. I recorded it all. I am eighteen now and fancied watching it again for some good old nostalgia. I then realized how childish it was, and wrote this review.  And I never said Miki was a loser; try reading my review properly before you bash you dimwit. E.Wilson is over 16, at least that much I have worked out. For her to get so stroppy over this seems quite immature. You really are in lala land. I will state again that this show is (and is aimed for as stated by its creator) 8 to 12 year old girls. I understand that everyone who reads my review will bash me because most people that come to Amazon to buy it probably have the whole series fan subbed already and are huge fans, so I'm sorry if my review offends you but hey we cant all think alike. The two stars I have given this product are for it lovely music. I still have 7 MB cds that cost a bomb of ebay and I wouldn't lose them for the world. They bring back memories of when I was a child who enjoyed the show and hoped to meet a yuu of her own someday.",1094083200,2,5982,4.363881401617251
1982496,5,B00019JQPK,"I am a huge fan of the Marmalade Boy manga, so I picked this DVD box set up as soon as I could!  I had high expectations and belive me, this box set didn't let me down!
There are 19 eps on 3 DVD's.  The box itself is sturdy and better than most box styles I've seen.  There's an inside pocket that holds liner notes and *a special mini pencil board*!
The DVD menu's are easy to use.  You have japanese and english dialogue with the options of subtitles.
The anime looks perfect, I couldn't have asked for better picture or sound!
The story is great and this DVD set is also great.  If you are a MB fan, go ahead and buy this! It's totally worth it!
Now if only the 2nd volume was out...",1089244800,7,686,4.014705882352941
1982497,5,B00019JQPK,"It's hard to describe M.B. without giving spoilers. It's basically a story of Miki and he romance with her live in (soon to be) ""brother"".
If you have any interest in Japanese culture this series is seeped in it. From what drastic haircuts mean... to social dynamics in the classroom and romance between teenagers.
It's funny that Amazon mentions that this came out the same year as Evangelion. In my opinion this series has held up better than Evangelion.
The characters are DEEP and amazing. There are no 2D ones in this series.. no filler characters to paint the background. It's funny, heartwarming, heartbreaking and joyous. A modern anime classic.",1083628800,11,653,4.945454545454545
