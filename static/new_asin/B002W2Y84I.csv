8382798,5,B002W2Y84I,"The dialogue between Tom and Robert in this dvd has the feel of spontaneity and presence of HS. I also will say that the depth of commentary requires the use of the pause button a lot, this is not something to rush through. Tom's unerring consistency, Robert's open questions, and the gentle goodness felt make this well worth paying attention to for any serious course student. For those new to the course this dvd can also show that levity has a place in our study too.",1325289600,2,471,4.488372093023256
8382799,5,B002W2Y84I,"Having spent the last two years to pursuing the teachings of A Course In Miracles, I had been in somewhat of a self-constructed black hole. This DVD effectively got me back on track by reaffirming the truths I already knew, and speaking to the challenges through personal identification. I highly recommend it for anyone in such a place. Thanks!",1316304000,,345,4.864406779661017
8382800,5,B002W2Y84I,This is an outstanding look at forgiveness as taught by A Course In Miracles.  This dialogue is very educational and helps one to fully understand the idea of forgiveness as expressed in ACIM.  Highly recommended for study groups because it generates much discussion.  A great addition to the book Dialogue on Awakening by Tom Carpenter,1313798400,,336,5.072727272727272
