8486998,2,B005UO3B7A,"There's so much I want to learn about New Zealand.  When and where do you see kiwi birds?  Do they feel like what Canada is to the US is what they are to Australia?  Do Maoris and Pakehas get along?  How often do you hear Maori and is it hard or easy to pick up?  What are they doing to protect the environment and indigenous species?  Are there jobs down there and how can willing Americans be hooked up with them?  And the list goes on...
What I heard or read is that Pakehas signed a treaty called the Treaty of Waitangi which says something like Maoris were brave soldiers who fought well against colonization.  It said they must be acknowledged for their strength, or something like that.  I wanted to see this doc to see if it would explain the Treaty and give any suggestions as to how different races get along today down there.
This work is FIVE episodes on TWO videocassettes.  It may be a bit much for us folk with cursory knowledge of New Zealand who only wanted to get our feet wet.  My cousin has complained that America's History Channel focuses too much on WWII.  However, my mother said that was the 1st big war that was televised and I find that there is a huge group of Americans who want to know about that war and its time period is much as possible.  ""New Zealand Wars"" may have been more for hardcore Kiwi historians or wannabe historians than rubes like myself.  I just heard too much of ""this skirmish happened btwn these groups,"" ""Then this one happened,"" ""now in this skirmish, blah blah blah.""
In short, I wasn't feeling this as much as I expected.  However, it may be a strong documentary for discerning Kiwi viewers.",1413158400,,1646,4.403973509933775
