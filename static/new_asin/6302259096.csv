445303,5,6302259096,Best movie I've seen in a long time. I love Harrison Ford always have. But in this movie he shows us how things can change in an instant and what is truly important in life. Best portrayal of a tragedy in life that can help us than I can ever remember. Excellent movie.,1522454400,,269,4.09433962264151
445304,5,6302259096,"Uplifting and insightful are two of the words I would like to use to describe this. Its amazing how functional we can be even after forgetting most of our lives. What is important to us right now may not be relevant later, only your loved ones do. I am reminded that turning my life around towards making everyone in it happier must be the true goal of my life. Harrison Ford is amazing actor and this is one of the few movies I wouldn't mind watching again and again.

I was having difficulty learning Spanish and was thinking of giving it up but seeing Henry relearn English after having his right frontal lobe damaged, has given me new inspiration.",1522454400,,651,4.470588235294118

This was the first film I saw Bening in and  made me look for her in other films.  Harrison Ford proved he was more than Solo and Jones.

445361,5,6302259096,"I bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape I no longer have the ability to view.  It is a heartwarming tale of a nasty human being largely affected by a criminal act. Interesting evolution of Henry's character in a life instructional way and great story.

He was significantly injured and lost his killer instincts in this incident. After lengthy recovery and his personality and the understanding of the world has changed while relearning how to eat and speak.

445363,5,6302259096,This is one of my all time favorite movies. Excellent acting and story.  A very inspiring movie....it's about watching a real jerk become a much better person; getting shot was the best thing that ever happened to him.

445366,4,6302259096,"I've seen most of Harrison Ford's films, and feel that this is one of his best performances.

445434,4,6302259096,"Poignant drama with the moral of the story being that sometimes we have our deepest, most fulfilling lives during hardship, illness or loss knowing the former things have passed away forever. The movie was realistic in that there were moments of carelessness, loose talk, and secrets that surfaced after Henry's traumatic brain injury which caused him pain. There were also lots of human caring such as his law firm trying to let him continue with them even though he was not the man he used to be. No one was outright mean to him.  I loved the way his wife looked at him with admiration and affection when she didn't realize we were watching. I'm wondering how much the movie made for the Ritz product placement. ha ha",1498176000,2,719,4.6171875

The story never gets cliched or convoluted, tiresome or olde, thanks to good direction, production and an outstanding screenplay.

445498,4,6302259096,"I'm the 1117th person to review this film.

While not the best movie, it's not the worst either. I liked the good-natured and light-hearted aspect of this film. After suffering from a catastrophic attack in an armed robbery, Henry must rehabilitate his life and attempts to do this with the help of his physical therapist and his warm and loving family. I liked this film and I truly wish it had caught on with a wider audience. I remember when it was out in the theatres and Harrison Ford truly makes the best of a meagre script. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed the film. Ford and and Annette Benning and the girl who played the daughter all have a nice chemistry together as a family. I believed they were a family.

Seeing a young John Leguizamo as the robber is a scene stealing moment as two great actors face one another. This is a nice and little sentimental movie. Avoid it if you don't like sentimental films. Buy it on DVD if you do.

One more thing. the gunshot wound to the head would have caused more damage than was shown in the film. I know of a person who suffered a similar gunshot wound to the head and for 20 years this person has been all but incapacitated. This part of the film is a major contrivance and quite unrealistic. Yet I still give this film Three and a Half Stars.",1476748800,,1294,4.360995850622406

445580,5,6302259096,"Not one of Harrison Ford's more popular hits but definitely one of his best works. The movie showcases Ford's great acting ability which highlights subtle nuances and the depth of ""Henry's"" character as an almost obnoxious hotshot lawyer to a helpless victim of amnesia re-learning things, the world, his life and his relationships. Even Annette Bening delivers as the privileged wife who has to adapt to the new Henry and in the process, brings out the best in the themselves as a family. Surprisingly, the daughter is the one that holds them together and fills in the gaps and needs of each parent as they try to rediscover and adjust to one another.  It is a very poignant and touching story and I feel that acting skills played a very big part in touching the audience. It is a movie I never tire of watching again and again.",1465776000,,829,4.601351351351352

It is touching and should strike a nerve in all work-a-holics and/or people who have made money their god, all but forgetting what 'doing the right thing' means.  It is also wonderfully encouraging for those lost as to who they really are and what life, love and work SHOULD be all about when the facade and pretense is stripped away either by force, by chance or by choice.  My favorite scene is when his therapist comes for a visit and shares a beer and some wisdom with Harry.  This is good stuff!!!  In a generation full of anti-heroes... This, albeit older, movie has a lot to give that is sorely lacking in today's world: Forgiveness, redemption, reconciliation and a true sense of the importance of of love, loyalty and family.",1460419200,2,780,4.58273381294964

Henry (Harrison Ford) has to relearn how to walk,  who he is, what he wants in life, who he wants to be, whats important, etc. after a near fatal accident. I am not sure where this movie falls... family, adult, in the middle, but I enjoyed it and so did my wife.",1459209600,,406,4.05

447862,4,6302259096,"Harrison Ford is always good.  Very interesting how we change our minds after a traumatic event.  Loved how his daughter helped him and in the end he missed her. Before the event he probably would not have noticed she was gone and she knew that. Also, being rich isn't always what we think it is.  Real happiness has nothing to do with money.  We are so easily tempted because we think that is success.  Real success is knowing yourself and finding it within yourself.",1459209600,,468,4.523809523809524

448242,5,6302259096,"The story of two successful, self-absorbed New Yorkers who have a young daughter.  One evening before a party, Henry interrupts a hold-up when he stops in a shop for cigarettes and is shot in the head.  Recovery is not certain.  He lies in a coma for a long time and gradually comes out of it unable to speak or walk.  Slowly and with a lot of hard work through therapy (and helped by his daughter) Henry recovers abilities, but not without a lot of financial cost which requires them to take the girl out of her expensive private school, leave their expensive apartment, lose their jobs, and learn that their former values didn't really count for much.  An uplifting movie that will stay with you.",1446336000,11,698,4.552

Some people didn't like it, but since I know what it's to go though a type of head trauma, I loved it.

448298,5,6302259096,Can a good lawyer be a good person? Guess it depends on how you define good. This movie reminds me that what we become depends a lot on circumstances beyond our contol. But in the worst of circumstances we do get to choose our response.  I like choice the author chose for the lawyer (Harrison Ford) in this story.  The truly great make these kind of choices while the rest of mankind live in mediocrity.  It is an encouraging story to me.,1437696000,,439,4.329268292682927

448403,5,6302259096,"This movie is so moving, so deep, it reaches inside ourselves and pulling inner aspects out never before, never imagined, making anything possible. For that reason it is inspirational. It also makes people realize how little we take life for granted and how in the blink of an eye everything we have, it can be gone forever. This movie, the title fits, focusing the attention to his character and how it is tested throughout the film, not only of how he adapts to the changes in his life, but has the capability to go back to his normal life. Ironically, when he is capable of returning to his old life he sacrifices the old one for a new one and with the new  changes are made for the better, making it all the worthwhile.

This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in the long time and I watch it when it comes on TV. Great flick,  showing another of side of Harrison ford and not the usual stereotypical action-hero, good guy Indiana Jones type. This character he plays great, is more along the lines of  more of depth, of emotional trauma and drama, and of finding himself metaphorically speaking, which as humans we  tend to do, going down a certain path for a while. But in his case, through the film, he is trying to find himself all over again, down a more alternate route.

Personally, I thought this movie was really good. The score was well unified with the film, creating imagery for the film and easy listening as well by the legend Hans Zimmer who scored the Lion King, Gladiator, Pirates of the Carribean. The writing was superb as most 90's movies. Great collaboration of cast and even the cover shown is symbolic to the film being a part of him is gone from view, but would it be gone forever and the question is will become a whole again? Great movie I highly reccomend it. I told my mother, a big Harrison Ford fan she has to see it and not just because of that, because it is really that good. Buy the dvd, you won't be disappointed, a great experience!",1424304000,,1981,4.369565217391305

No one reconciles because one of you forgot all the baggage and likes you just the way you are/gets to know you all over again.  They either want you or they don't.  This movie is entertaining because of the unrealistically expensive interiors and lifestyles - EXACTLY like the ones in Devil's Advocate.

The daughter like the French actress in Firelight resembles Frances Hodgeson Burnett's description of Sarah Crewe in The Secret Garden.

Ritz crackers taste of hydrogenated oil and are tasty when you happen to be starving but the claggy mouth taste is a signal that this movie is shenanigans.

It's basically saying that if Paris was nuked, Berlin would be the new Paris or if China was nuked and forgotten, Japan would be peaceful in its position of most popular in Asia and as Tina Chow nee Lutz's mother raised her to propagate, Japan is the standard bearer of all that is good about China that the Chinese no longer practice themselves.

I think any one who placed themselves in Harrison Ford's shoes - might get a little scared and worried that if this happened to them - and there was an All About Eve waiting in the wings to accommodate the amnesia ...  a little creepy, right?

I think many of us would choose to drink water as Tony Leung Chiu Wai's character chose in ""Ashes of Time"" when offered the wine of forgetfulness by Tony Leung Kar Fai playing Perverted East who damaged the former's wife and would like the former to forget the latter's transgression.  The latter of course makes a big show of drinking said wine as if to say HE's ""all good now"" exactly like Henry.

He is so 'normal' and natural in his acting. The storyline was awesome from start to finish.

448601,5,6302259096,"My fiance was involved in a serious car accident about a year ago and suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) - When casually talking about it to a doctor friend of mine she recommended that we watch this movie together. Before the accident, Harrison Ford was always one of my fiance's favorite actors so he was looking forward to watch it and he absolutely loved it.  He ""connected"" with Jack, the main character, through most of the movie and opened up about symptoms and feelings he had never or could never explained to me. The symptoms ""Jack"" suffered as a consequence of his injury, specifically damage to his frontal lobe and anoxia, are in line with the real symptoms TBI victims experience and that unfortunately, my fiance has continuously experienced to this day.  After witnessing and learning enough about TBI, I have to say that Jack's case is somewhat unrealistic and less likely to happen in real life but many cases have been reported that injuries of this sort may in fact bring on positive changes on an individual's personality and behavior.  And I remain hopeful. I see small improvements taking place every day so why lose hope?  Although it's not considered a major Hollywood Blockbuster, it is indeed a well-acted, well-written and well-directed film.  Ford does an amazing job portraying Jack and so does Annette Benning as his wife. Basically, the movie is a reminder that sometimes tragedy strikes as a wake up call  for improvement and necessary changes in your life.  It gives you hope that a near-death injury, with very real possibly permanent physical, neurological, and cognitive changes or impairments may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.  The message is clear:  don't ever lose hope - anything can happen and always look for the positive aspect of every situation.  I highly recommend this movie especially to those who have had a loved one suffer a TBI...it is insightful and uplifting.",1395532800,34,1928,4.904615384615385

It might have been because it was a date movie with the man I'd marry and am still married to, it might be because I've meant people who have suffered such severe brain damage and it's such a hopeful story.  It might be  because Harrison Ford is such a great actor.  I'm not sure so much what it is, but, I know the movies effective, and it works, it works perfectly.  It draws you in, it conects you to the characters, you feel their struggles, the want for normality, the reconnection between loved ones, the process of seeing the world through new eyes, and appreciating things on an entirely different level.

The range that his character goes through really puts Ford to the test of being an actor, and he rises to the test and passes with flying colors.  He never characatures his character, but plays him honestly and with a sincerity that pulls you into the film. Benning is also honest and believable. It is not only Ford's character that goes through a change, but Bennings does as well. And she does an excellent job of helping the viewer to identify with her struggle.  The director takes the viewer on the recovery journey with the characters and has you cheering for them all the way.

These patients may still have some prelearned skills reserved, but often lose the ""fine tune"" and quick learning ability, such as subtle feeling of emotion, social appropriateness, tolerance to frustration, and short term memory. The morality sense of brain injured people usually become stubborn and self-centered. Most people act better than their inner personality. When brain injured, people may have something called ""disinhibition,"" that is to act more of their inner nature and less of socially learned behavior, which is usually not pleasant.

I used to be embarrased to tell my friends that it was one of the best (dramatic) movies that I had ever seen, but it has remained that way for years. I always fall back on this movie. It never ceases to put a smile on my face and realize that we aren't stuck in the lives that we created for ourselves during our earlier days.  It gives you hope for change and delight for what is to come for the future. Henry and his family have a TON of money and wealth that you could only imagine, but they give it all up; the partnership at the firm and the million dollar apartment in Manhattan for one of the most beatiful things you can imagine; LOVE and FAMILY.

I don't know how the other reviewers feel about this movie, but when Henry returns back to the apartment, towards the end of the movie and he returns to his wife, I always have to fight back the tears. (Because I am a tough guy, huh??) The movie is filled with many awesome moments...one of my favorites is when he is taught to read again with his daughter. A celebration ensues in the kitchen with Henry hugging everyone in sight, including the maid.

There are also a lot of painful moments that make you grateful for the people that will always stick by you during tough times; one of which was the moment when Henry and his wife are at a party and one of their (so-called) friends calls Henry an ""idiot"" while they were talking behind their back. I just wanted to jump through the screen and strangle them!!!

448992,4,6302259096,"In February 2007, my eldest daughter (age 35) was struck by a car that ran a red light.  She sustained massive head trauma and brain damage. In working my way through this tragedy it just happened that ABC aired the piece by Bob Woodruff on the subject AND, somehow, I remembered this film.

When I originally saw the film I viewed it as a pleasant enough experience but pretty much passed it off.  It came out during the period when Dustin Hoffman did Rainman and DeNiro did Awakenings.  So it seemed like a ""me to"" film of that ilk.  I didn't think it was as good as either of those films at the time, and still don't.  But I think that would be more about the writing than the acting.  All parties on the acting front put out good work here.

BUT coming back to this film after the brain injury of my daughter, I did view it through different eyes and it was, somehow, helpful to me at that time.  The doctors said she would undergo a ""personality shift"" which we were all fearful of.  This film helped take the sting out of that prediction by telling us that may not be all bad.

So I'll keep this film and remember both what I thought of it then and what I thought of it 16 years later.  Recommended.",1184025600,4,1205,4.213973799126638

Of course it is sentimental and manipulative, but all films are manipulative. I liked Harrison's work, and I even liked Annette Bening, which does not always happen for me. Most of us wonder whether, if we suffered a serious brain injury or a spinal cord break, if we would survive, and cope. This film shows one fictional guy facing that crisis, and becoming a better man for having lost some of his mental toughness and job skills.

Harrison Ford plays a very strong and convincing role in a movie that no Ford fan should be without!

449051,5,6302259096,"I was about 14 or 15 when this movie came out. I liked it because Harrison Ford was in it and because I liked few of the scenes on there. To be honest, I really can't remember what those scenes where! Weird?

Anyway, I've seen it a few times now as an adult and I get a whole new emotion from this. ""Sometimes you have to hit bottom in order to reach the top once again"". This is what has happened in this movie. Harrison Ford's character was a cold and arrogant Lawyer that didn't care for anything or anyone unless it gave him financial gain in some form. He and his wife had many friends who later in the movie they discover how ""true"" those friends are. It's a sad moment in the movie that many of us have or (heaven forbid) will have experienced in our lives...heaven knows that I have.

After his accident he changes into another man who is compassionate, thankful and most importantly, humbled. Something of which most of his 'said' friends are not. They're uncomfortable with the change so they do what they do best. They judge, mock...whatever you feel fits. One of my favorite scenes is when Henry goes to one of his old client's apartment and he appoligizes for what he did during one of the cases. That in itself is amazing because he honestly didn't remember doing the work. Of course he finds out after reading some of his cases.

Some people here may not like the movie because of what it represents. I on another hand look at it more of a positive way and I've found that this is one of the best movies they've made.

Judge the movie for yourself. It's a good one!",1122249600,8,1580,4.327702702702703

Henry Turner is a very hard man to like in the beginning of this movie, and so is his wife. As a result of walking into a seemingly random accident, (""going out for cigarettes,"" it seems smoking means nothing but a bad person anymore) Henry begins a long and arduous recovery process from a brain injury. Along the way to finding out what he once was, he finds that what he once was is something he no longer cares to be. Watching his wife, his daughter, his colleagues, friends, and even his beagle dog along the way is something pretty special to see as Henry moves along to deal with all the circumstances in his life that he previously sought to ignore. This movie, to me, seems to be about a redemption that is possible for all of us. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes drama with a good ending, which is not always possible in reality. I think Henry is all about hope and change for the better. This is a good movie that is not one of the best, but one that you remember long after having viewed it.

449054,4,6302259096,"This isn't one of Harrison Ford's bigger hits, but it should be, at least within the dramatic genre. Sure, he's Indiana Jones, and he's Han Solo, but outside of those series, Ford's movie choices have occasionally left this fan, at least, scratching her head (Sabrina? What were you thinking!?).
""Regarding Henry"" is a rare little gem of a story, a simple film about a man whose life changes, believe it or not, for the better when he's shot and nearly killed by dint of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ford's Henry Turner takes us through a life he doesn't remember, including a daughter and a wife played by an impossibly young and fresh-faced Annette Bening.
Sure, it's a little sentimental. But it's a pretty simple story with a positive feel. Filmed on location in New York City, the Manhattan scenery is rather delightful as well.
It's not film noir, it's not a tour de force of characterization, and no, it's not Academy Award winning screenwriting. But it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, one Ford doesn't have any reason to be ashamed of.",1086134400,43,1059,4.698924731182796
449055,5,6302259096,"I know this movie was not a big hit when it came out but it is really a good film.  Harrison Ford is great as one of his most likeable characters that I have seen him portray.  Henry, a corrupt lawyer who withholds evidence when his client is obviously guilty and a womanizer is seriously injured in a robbery.  When he comes to, he has lost his memory and has to be re-taught just about everything.  His teacher is a very virtuous man, who teaches Henry to enjoy the good things in life (Henry loves most of all Ritz crackers).  Thus the mean, cheating Henry who forced his daughter to remain at a boarding school that she hates, is suddenly transformed into a kind man who cares about everybody's feelings.
Eventually, he figures out that the Henry he once was was a horrible person and he hopes never to go back to that life.
Annette Benning is great and beautiful as the wife that had an uncaring husband who all of a sudden loves her more than anything.  She has to decide if she is ready to leave the life they led with other uncaring and obnoxious friends.

Yawn.
The movie's slowly unfurling narrative and its high predictability levels could have made it a skippable fare, but Ford's rendition of amnesia is moving, and Annette Bening's performance is very impressive. An occasional saving grace is also the music, if you have an ear for that kind of stuff.

449089,4,6302259096,"This atypical Harrison Ford-Annette Bening outing is one of those guilty pleasures that critics who deride it won't fess up to its feel-good result. We see Ford first as an ethic-skirting attorney whose sense of justice apparently doesn't extend beyond how the letter of the law can be manipulated to ""win"" at the cost of ""human"" justice. Of course, the film's premise that a gunshot wound to the head, which is what happens to Ford's character of Henry Turner, can create a neurological about-face in character is ridiculous. But we don't care. It's plain fun and reassuring to see Henry go from an amoral, apparently unfeeling big shot to a family man seeking to fit into his new world. Ford carries this film all the way and proves he can unleash an emotional performance, something most of his film characters aren't required to do. The film's closing scene, with Ford being called up to the teacher's desk, is a satisfying and fitting end. As for Benning, she's thoroughly engaging as the wife who gets a treat of having her life completely uprooted, for the better!",1036972800,10,1071,4.794594594594595

Both are compelling portraits.  The film works for any particular viewer, I think, to the extent that we are able to see parts of either of these characters in us.  And that includes (almost) all of us.
The film is also a must-own for all fans of medical rehabilitative services;  you've gotta love these people!
So, although its not GREAT art or cinema, it is a very well done and compelling story.",1016409600,6,672,4.8
449092,5,6302259096,"Despite being less well known, ""Regarding Henry"" is one of Harrison Ford's best works. The film demands a wide spectrum from this great actor and he delivers convincingly. For the most part, the other performers take their cue from Ford's ""Henry"" and render a near perfect glimpse of a life that could have been.
The tile character, Henry Turner, is  introduced to us as a top-flight litigator for a large New York legal firm. He is well groomed, dressed in a designer suit and he is seen speaking sincerely to a jury about human desires and justice. Our opinion of him changes as soon as Henry leaves the court. He quickly makes a call to his interior designer to berate her for having the wrong table delivered to his palatial home. He is just another lawyer, after all.
It is hard to watch this movie at the start. Henry is one of those men we all love to hate. He is selfish, self centered, successful and confident. His daughter is frightened of him and his wife is a pale reflection of him. Luckily we are not forced to watch this Henry for very long. He makes the classic movie exit and ""goes out for some cigarettes.""
What follows is a scene that is perfectly directed. Henry walks into a corner store demanding his brand of cigarettes, unaware that the other patron is robbing the owner. Henry does not become scared but before he can even attempt to control the situation, he is lying on the sidewalk with two bullets inside his body and the wail of  approaching sirens in the background. This event is the cusp of Henry's life.
Annette Bening plays Henry's Wife, Sarah. She may not be in love with her husband anymore but she needs him. As her financial position becomes clear, she realizes she needs him very much. But she is not unaffected by it all. This is the man in her life, the father of her child, a good provider and protector. Seeing him lying motionless in a hospital bed, drooling and staring vacantly, is probably the most painful thing she has ever experienced. But there is some hope of recovery.
Henry's long rejuvenation at a specialty medical center is like a rebirth. He remembers nothing, coming into his new world without the power  of speech or the ability to walk. His midwife/physiotherapist, Bradley, is wonderful. He is full of life, energy and enthusiasm. As Henry is taught to walk and speak and function, Bradely becomes the mainstay of his life. Sarah keeps her distance and Henry doesn't get to see his daughter, (Rachel), at all until the day he is deemed fit to go home, a scary separation from the only people he trusts.
But the Henry that returns to a home he barely remembers, is not the same man that left for cigarettes. He is a little shy, very calm, forgiving, gentle and above all, nice. His transformation is interpreted in different ways by different groups. The movie serves as an interesting depiction of how society views disabilities. His boss is patronizing, his daughter delighted, his mistress is distraught and for the longest time, Sarah doesn't know what to feel.
The ending may be predictable but in this case, it is the journey that we love. Most of us feel we have lost our innocence and that our honor has been a little tarnished by life's decisions. Henry takes us on a trip to see what might happen if we surrendered all the hard won prizes in our life and instead, chose to embrace life itself. This is a film that will make you feel. Some days, that's just what we need.",1003622400,187,3443,4.558966074313409

CLOSING SCENE:  Henry the Humble graciously and sincerely assists this family.

Regarding Henry makes clear we spend our lives misplacing our affections. The only people who truly care about and love Henry before his accident are his wife and daughter; he spends his time with everyone else. They are also the only ones who care about and love Henry after his accident, when his formerly ""faithful"" business colleagues abandon him - his cold-blooded instincts and machiavellian legal talents having been destroyed by his accident (brain anoxia due to a damaged subclavian artery). As in Dustin Hoffman's Rainman and Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump, there is humor and much innocence. Innocence is moving when its vehicle is an adult rather than a child: It's rarer.

But there *is* one other character who cares about and loves Henry: His earthy, streetsmart physical therapist Bradley, who patiently and lovingly teaches Henry to walk, talk, and even think again. On their daily strolls around the sanitarium where Henry is recuperating gradually, Bradley always ogles the cute young nurses, constantly telling the still-mute and barely-able-to-walk Henry, ""I gotta get me some o' that!"" Later, it becomes My Fair Lady in reverse when, after several weeks of this operant conditioning, a cute young nurse jogs past the two of them and Henry very innocently mumbles to Bradley, ""Yeah, you gotta get you some o' that"". But make no mistake, Bradley has a heart of gold, he enhances this film with his infectious joie-de-vivre, and his humanity saves Henry. Harrison Ford delivers a touching and convincing performance here.
