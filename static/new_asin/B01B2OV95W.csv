8749139,4,B01B2OV95W,"I bought this set strictly for fun and information. I really like it for what it is. It give a lot of insight into what Krav Maga is, and I can use it to supplement other training. The views shown in the video are complete.
One side note that I found a little distracting, was that this is not filmed in English. In other words, the English language is dubbed into the video.",1499644800,2,375,4.1506849315068495
8749140,5,B01B2OV95W,"I was going to purchase the level 1 DVD, but noticed that the complete set of 3 was almost the same price. It was a great deal when considering the cost of buying all 3 separate. The quality of the videos themselves is good and they contain a lot of useful information. The production quality is not quite as good as the Ultimate Krav Maga series, but still better than most others on the market.",1494028800,,396,4.293333333333333
