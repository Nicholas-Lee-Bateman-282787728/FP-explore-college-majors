4006844,5,B002WG73VY,"This is really impressive. A show filmed in the 1950s on 35mm which has survived in excellent condition.  The 35mm to digital transfer is really clean and the sound is good. The extras consist of commentary tracks of which there are 10 out of the 12 episodes in the set. That is quite a feat especially for a show produced so many years ago. Though sometimes there are some awkward moments where the commentaries divert or get muddled (they seem to be free-form, recorded over-the-phone conversations) there is always something interesting to be found. Sometimes there are reminisces about working on the production and others talk about the aircraft of the time and the burgeoning space program, etc.

The show itself is always fun. Each story is wildly different from the next.  Col. Canyon is shuttled from place to place almost like an Office Temp, doing different jobs at different Air Force bases. All of the job relocation may not make too much sense but that sort of cohesive over-structure is not the main point. The point is having various adventures and fitting them within the world of the USAF. Some stories are almost like mini-movies, having a strong 1st, 2nd and 3rd act and are full of drama (Pilot Error, Operation Survival) and others are more like a highlight of Air Force technology (Operation Tow Line, Operation Zero Launch), and others blend the two seamlessly (Operation Moby Dick).

These shows wind up being like potato chips. After downing a couple, you want more. And more! So I've ordered the 2nd Vol knowing that I'm coming to the end of the 1st Vol.  Hopefully sometime in 2011 we'll get the 3rd Vol which will finish up the series and I believe is supposed to have a documentary on it as an extra.

It seems that getting this collection produced has been a labor of love for John Ellis and it shows all the way through. The whole thing is top-notch. Also this show has made me acquainted with the almost spaceship-like interceptor jets the F102 Delta Daggers. The design is so sleek and cool that I had to track a model of one down for my desk. Now I just need a ""Steve Canyon"" decal for it!",1298419200,3,2124,4.620689655172414
4006845,5,B002WG73VY,I bought this because I participated in the filming of episode 6.  My crew flew the C-130  from the 773rd TCS at Ardmore AFB to California to be used in the filming. All the episodes have excellent video of USAF aircraft.  I would recommend this to any old AF veterans.,1294531200,8,269,4.34
4006846,4,B002WG73VY,"Just like the special edition, the footage is phenomenal. Awesome military aircraft footage. Of course the show itself is interesting, but even if you're not into the series itself, you get a great snapshot of 1950's military mindset. Love the original cigarette commercials, too!",1276473600,2,280,5.386363636363637
4006847,5,B002WG73VY,"The quality of the DVD's of this show are nothing short of outstanding.  They have been meticulously restored to their original glory, as well as the original commercials and promos that were of the time.  A real trip back to the late 1950's. We can only hope that the Milton Canniff Estate also uses Amazon to sell the other two volumes of the series -- making it simplier for fans to obtain these long lost shows !!",1266364800,2,417,4.402597402597403
4006848,5,B002WG73VY,"Superlatives can't adequately describe ""The Complete Steve Canyon on TV--Volume 1."" This is a most remarkable DVD set. As a retired aerospace engineer who vividly remembers watching this show on television when it was originally on the air more than 50 years ago, I may be a little biased. But I don't hesitate to say that the far-ranging airborne adventures of U.S. Air Force Colonel Stevenson B. Canyon, serial number A0-041044, should appeal to practically anyone. Do you like early-jet-age U.S. aircraft? Many different types of them are here in profusion, featured in stunning aerial sequences filmed with full Air Force cooperation especially for this show (there's little stock footage here). Are you a fan of 1950s black-and-white television series? None were better than ""Steve Canyon"" at delivering just the right blend of action, suspense and realism. Do you follow the early careers of actors who later made it big? You'll find them guest-starring here, including Marion Ross, Jacqueline Scott, DeForest Kelley, Martin Milner and Richard Crane. Does the work of the late Milton Caniff, creator of the ""Terry and the Pirates"" and ""Steve Canyon"" comic strips, interest you? Mr. Caniff's passion for aviation, his dedicated professionalism, his unstinting demand for accuracy and his personal involvement in the details shine through in every ""Steve Canyon"" episode. Mr. Caniff himself chose actor Dean Fredericks for the title role (Mr. Fredericks was a bit-player in the classic 1954 ""giant bug"" science fiction film ""Them!"").

The 12 half-hour episodes in this set were broadcast from September 12, 1958, through June 2, 1959. They are all meticulously restored from the original 35mm film broadcast masters, and all have exceptional crispness, outstanding contrast and excellent sound quality. Ten of them have fascinating audio commentary tracks, and all include ABC network promo spots and vintage commercials--for Chesterfield cigarettes, naturally, in a nostalgic but jarring look back to the days when everybody smoked on television shows and tobacco companies were major sponsors. There's a main menu with thumbnails, and each show has six thumbnailed chapter stops for easy accessibility. All in all, the production values of the DVDs and the packaging are superior. And the episodes themselves? In a word, superb--each one is an unforgettable dramatic treat. Each one is an immensely enjoyable half-hour escape into a (literally) black-and-white retro-world of roaring jets, imminent danger, steely eyed pilots and ""girl-next-door"" sweethearts. This is really great ""right stuff!""

I've given five-star ratings to many of the Amazon products that I've reviewed. I like to think that I apply effective selection criteria before I buy, and, yes, I usually pay attention to other reviews. But I have never recommended anything more enthusiastically than I do ""The Complete Steve Canyon on TV--Volume 1."" If you vaguely remember watching this rare ""lost"" television series as a child, your purchase should be a no-brainer. If not, you should still give it a try. There has never been anything like it on television, and there never will be again.",1263513600,20,3163,5.375
4006849,5,B002WG73VY,Anyone interested in the history of aviation or television would have to be very pleased to watch this video. There are many scenes of flying with long retired military aircraft and the commercials are amazing! Acting and story lines are very good. Most of all the restoration of this vintage TV show is obviously the result of a labor of love.,1262908800,2,344,4.655737704918033
4006850,5,B002WG73VY,"I have more of a personal recollection of the famed comic strip than I do the 1958 television show based on the adventures of STEVE CANYON. However, although I have no interest in the military or in jet airplanes, I cut my teeth on John Wayne movies at my mother's side. When Duke chased America's enemies in his fighter jets, I felt exhilaration. As I got older, I learned to appreciate good writing, good acting and good production values. When I received the STEVE CANYON VOLUME 1 dvd, the twelve episodes featured provided exhilarating storylines with good writing, good acting and good production values.

Dean Fredericks charmingly brings to life the character of Steve Canyon. He is matched with equally likeable supporting actors, including Abel Fernandez and Robert Hoy. Guest stars will surprise the viewer. One will see a number of familiar faces in the early stages of their careers--actors such as STAR TREK stars DeForest Kelley and Leonard Nimoy, Marion Ross (HAPPY DAYS), Richard Anderson (THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN), Russell Johnson (GILLIGAN'S ISLAND) and many others.

I have obtained not only the Volume One Edition offered here, but also Volume Two and the SPECIAL EDITION, and have not been disappointed in adding these fine DVDs to my collection. In fact, each new episode is more thrilling than the previous one! I look forward to the final volume of the series, which should be released next year.

I've also enjoyed the old commercials for products and other television shows of the era, which are quite a contrast to what we see today. Commentaries led by producer, John Ellis, as he draws out the actors, writers, and others involved in the production of this fine series are also a revelation. Ellis has remastered the 1958 films with new technology so that the picture is clear and bright, probably better than viewing them on the old black-and-white televisions available in the late 50's.

If you enjoy classic television, dramas about the military, the Air Force, fighter jets, the Steve Canyon comic strip, or just plain enjoy GOOD entertainment, I highly recommend the STEVE CANYON VOLUME ONE dvd.",1259884800,9,2133,4.98314606741573
4006851,5,B002WG73VY,"This series that was based on the long running comic strip, Steve Canyon, was a rare treat in that the planes, inside and out, were real...provided by the Air Force.  This was the most expensive tv series during it's time, which is the main reason it ran for only one year.

The episodes are a mix of the fun and exciting, and numerous actors with very familiar faces make appearances in several episodes.  Give it a try if you're interested in classic tv, the air force, military planes and equipment or just good, old fashioned drama.  I had never heard of this show until I found the DVDs available online and am enjoying the first two discs.  Keep an eye out for Discs 2 and 3, and there is further information if you go to stevecanyondvd on the blogspot website - FYI.

These episodes were restored and bonus tracks and material added through the dedication, time and expense of a handful of Steve Canyon fans and supporters...definitely a rare find!",1259712000,2,955,4.588235294117647

4006860,5,B002WG73VY,"I was ten years old in 1958 and Steve Canyon was my favorite television show.  I had to get every one of the DVD's as the come available and if you were around back then (and as crazy about airplanes as I was (and still am) you need these old TV shows too.  Even if you weren't around back then, the great (AF stock footage) filmwork and even the old Chesterfield Cigarette commercials (all exactly like they were when first broadcast) are excellent representatives of ""the way it was"" back then.  Big Thunder AFB may well have been fictional but the footage is mostly from Edwards AFB or the (now deactivated and civlianized) George AFB near Victorville, Ca.

You won't be disapointed at the quality and if you have any memories of Steve Canyon at all, these DVD's will bring back those days better than anything else could.

As they said at the start of every episode, ""Dedicated to the Men of the USAF"".  It was to the Air Force what ""Top Gun"" was to Naval Carrier aviation.",1308441600,,977,4.46067415730337
4006861,5,B002WG73VY,"Wow, these are fun. I was VERY young when these aired and since my father was an Air Force pilot, I just had to have these.
They're real time capsules of 1950s ""action-adventure"" TV and of the Air Force of the time.

Now, don't expect Martin Scorsese feature film quality in the scripts, that's not the point.
These were made to show off, albeit rather dramatically, what the Air Force was about circa 1958.
The acting, scripts and productions values are well above much of the 50s TV ""adventure"" genre.
Episodes were often filmed at real air bases with real aircraft...not much backlot stuff here.
Dean fredricks was especially good, it's ashame he didn't have a bigger career.",1308009600,,678,4.745762711864407
8383032,5,B002WG73VY,"Oh boy does this hit hit hit the spot. Never saw the show as a kid. I'I came for the vintage jets and stayed for the actually exciting plots. I am about half way through, and still impressed with the sharp transfer, with perfect image, audio, tones and contrast.  Acting has been fine, but the stories -- about planes taking off vertically, or the one where they decide that for national defense, instead of keeping jets aloft all the time, lets tow 3 or 4 behind each high-altitude  B-52 24/7, and then if they are needed, they drop off and fire up their engines. The cinematography is first rate, music good, the episodes just ""fly"" by. Hope the rest of the volumes are this good.",1507766400,,682,4.448
