5145861,5,B0089PTJV4,"Jessie James originally became famous for the fenders he personally built in his home garage. Play these DVD's, and you'll feel like you are right there with Jessie in his home garage being taught how to build his unique fender. From start to finished product he'll coach you the entire way, showing you how a true craftsman does it. No CNC, no WaterJet, just tools and muscle. I was extremely impressed with this production. Jessie says himself that he's doing this in reponse to the number of people that have contacted him to intern and learn from him. These DVD's are him giving away that knowledge for a pittance. I bought all three, and would rate the Bomber seat video a close second to this one. The exhaust video isn't quite as personal or intimate, thus I rate it 3rd.",1375056000,,778,4.564285714285714

8526403,5,B0089PTJV4,"First off, I don't know how a person could buy this INSTRUCTIONAL ""How to"" video and expect it to be highly entertaining when you have no interest in fabricating in the first place! No wonder it got 3 stars by some. This video shows a good deal of the methods and tooling used by Jesse to fabricate a fender from flat sheet. I like the fact he goes over the basic techniques so you get a good overall idea of how the process works. It could be more informative, but I was surprised of how detailed and long this video was for under $5. I didn't feel like this video left much out, especially when compared to other metal working videos that are $40 or more. Another feather in your metal working cap.",1473811200,2,700,4.2706766917293235
