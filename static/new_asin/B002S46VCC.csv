This is truly a story which could happen in almost any country and am am sure really has happened often.  The acting is very good with violence, sex and a mix of both throughout the movie.  Be prepared for strange twists in the story line as they make the movie better as it is view.  Love, hate and love/hate are all part of this fine movie.  Watch it.

3978227,4,B002S46VCC,"The movie was excellent and very well put together; however, viewers should be aware that the film centers around self-discovery/homophobia and teenage gang violence.  It contains several scenes depicting brutal hate crimes/gay bashings and one instance of graphic, forced sodomy that were hard to watch even though I work in the medical field and am a huge horror/suspense/thriller fan.  I had to look away and cringe several times just because of the raw emotion and blatant, senseless disregard for humanity.  It's sad that there are actually communities and disturbed individuals in the world today whose lives this film could represent.  Imagine what people could accomplish if we did away with organized religion and money, embraced our differences, worked together & pooled our collective knowledge...",1436400000,2,808,5.491935483870968

The ending had a nice twist, which is why I upgraded my rating from bad to okay. That kind of saved it for me, but not to the point where I could say that it was a good movie.

3978277,4,B002S46VCC,"The UK provided some professionalism in this movie. Usually the production quality of this type of movie is schlock. This one actually showed a car being driven on a highway. Did not realize that Bristol is such a dump. The movie needs subtitles even though it is supposedly in English. The low-class, gutter dialect was unintelligible at times. A little frontal nudity would not have hurt, but the UK doesn't allow it, even hotels provide only soft porn.

3978282,1,B002S46VCC,"I thought that this film was going to be wild and meaningful, but instead, it went off its rails too much to make any sense of all of the over-dramatized acting and the awful plot. The gang fights were stupid and nonsensical, the main character had no chemistry with his boyfriend, the violence was gratuitous and unnecessary, and that rape scene was absolutely despicable. Overall, it's a terrible film. If you want to watch something particularly interesting, you should pick up Shelter or Brokeback Mountain. They're all around better films.

3978287,1,B002S46VCC,"Right out of the self-loathing gay films of long ago, this piece of trash serves up a  mixture of bad sex, bad dialogue, bad direction, queer stereotypes, and negativity.  There were times I thought I was watching a Blaxploitation grinder flick from the 70s or a film by John Waters -- without the self empowerment, confidence, or humor. Those flicks at least were fun. This was just trite, boring, and absurd  -- and an insult to self respecting LGBT viewers so beware.  In the end i turned it off before it was finished.

3978290,5,B002S46VCC,"A wonderful movie! Very heartfelt, as well as being dark, gritty, and hard to look at during some points. It has a pretty cool story line, too. The one where there's the closeted straight boy that's so closeted, no body knows, at all. Has a difficult time accepting his sexuality, but comes across someone he falls in love with that he's willing to do anything for. I don't want to give anything away, so just watch.

3978291,4,B002S46VCC,"This film was intense. Being from America the content we get can be a bit more edited than the scenes you get in this movie. Very graphic, yes, but with a story so strong and such a ""sign of the times"" you can't help but watch through the whole thing and look beyond the sex.
As an aspiring filmmaker I love to watch any and everything. This movie proved to me that I don't have to be so American in my approach and that one should tell a story as is without sugar coating.",1332028800,,473,4.042553191489362
3978292,5,B002S46VCC,"I have seen a lot of gay movies in the past few years, as I was late coming out. I have explored the subject extensively to understand myself and what I have gone through. 80% of the movies don't do any justice, but there are a few GEMS, this is definitely one.

It is a hard movie to watch due to the bigotry and violence of a gang on a typical small city in England. However, the plot is so intelligent that makes the ugliness disappear. This movie covers: Redemption, Forgiveness, Compassion, Love, Struggle, Revenge, and a happy ending.

If you cry at movies, this is definitely a tear jerker. Watch the beginning and ending carefully, there is a twist.",1330646400,,657,4.466666666666667
3978293,4,B002S46VCC,"Shank way exceeds expectations. It's packaged as yet another gaysploitation flick--which annoys the hell out of me. Is Brokeback Mountain strictly for the gay ghetto? Of course not. Anyone with a pulse and at least half a heart could relate and appreciate the film. Granted this is not Ang Lee directing Jake and Heath. Nonetheless director Simon Pearce has polished his chops on a lot of TV and tells a compelling, nuanced story successfully steering clear of the tiresome clich&eacute;s of gay genre flicks. The young actors are entirely credible in their nicely fleshed out roles. True some of the young gang member supporting actors are a little rough around the edges and Alice Payne is truly awful, but the principle players--Wayne Virgo, Marc Laurent, and especially Gary Summers in a minor, but pivotal role--are all seriously good. This movie is all around a respectable piece of good work, even if the title Shank is grossly misleading and evocative of some prison-gang-rape-in-the-showers softcore crap. BTW, there is more than one male-on-male sex and nudity scene with a brief flash or 2 of full frontal, but well shot and not at all prurient nor exploitative. This is not a good gay movie. It's a good movie. Full stop.",1322179200,,1233,4.961352657004831

3978296,2,B002S46VCC,"Kudos to the filmmakers for tackling the theme and getting this done and released. Yet, the end result is unconvincing and the film a unbelievable mess by the end. The movie starts well enough once accustomed to the production values, but beyond the first 1/3 it just falls apart. There is little that is compelling here, neither the out of nowhere love interest, the twists, or the violence which in a couple of scenes is choreographed in a way to make it look silly. Plot points happen without feeling genuine. Characterizations, dialogue and violence are amateurish.
Not horrible acting, a compelling premise, and the effort raise this to two stars for an interesting take on the coming out story; and while disingenuous and a little silly, it is surprising. The film shows promise from the filmmakers, who I hope are very very young.

3978298,4,B002S46VCC,"I only write this to say thanks to the positive reviews on this page. I was initially put off getting this as there were so many negative posts regarding this film. But a mate got it for me and I thought it was a quietly brilliant film that truly deserved more attention.

The plot loosely, is a gang from Bristol do vicious and sadistic so called 'happy slapping' and film it on their mobiles, they are a dysfunctional generally unlikeable lot held together by an invisible bond seemingly based on mutual violence and fear of the female `leader'.

The main character Cal, stops a French exchange student getting a kicking and is thus ousted from the gang. He then ends up having a relationship with Olivier, but his former gang mates will not let matters rest there. The reasons reveal themselves in a manner of ways and at a rate that does not undermine the main storyline. His best mate from the gang is particularly vicious about the 'betrayal' of turning out 'queer', but as Quentin Crisp once said 'some roughs are pretty queer and some queers are pretty rough'.

Some of the detractors are right in that some of the characters are overly stereo typical and there are more coincidences than a Dickens melodrama. Also suspend belief at someone gaining access to a computer quicker than a super hero. However, this is a shoe string budget effort which is watchable, well acted and actually moving in parts. And it is an indie British flick not based in London and should be lauded for that if nothing else. The sex scenes have been called soft porn by some reviewers but they just felt natural given the content and circumstances in which they take place. If you are wavering about whether to get/see this or not I urge you to give 'Shank' a go and hopefully like me you will find it very much worth the effort.",1304208000,10,1815,4.561349693251533

3978301,5,B002S46VCC,"Shank is a movie of heartbreak and love.
Shank is a movie of violence and sexual desire.
Shank is filled with terror, fear and confusion.

As the film begins we see the normal guy on guy pick up.
They find a place to park; have sex and then the violence.
The younger guy head butts the slightly older guy
Leaving him bleeding in the woods without his cell phone.

A new student arrives and we find the guy left in the woods
Is actually a teacher who has the new foreign student in his class.
When he sees the new student with the guy that head butted him
He tries to warn the student and gives him his phone number.
He takes it without a second thought thinking he'll never need it.

The new student falls in love with the violent guy.
They begin to share the foreign student's apartment.
Life is good and they both are happy; all is lovely.
Until, the gang finds the phone that has video
Of the 2 guys at the beginning having sex
That's when all hell breaks loose.
That's when the phone number the teacher gave him
Comes into play and the movie turns to horror.

Will the teacher help his new student
Knowing he's going out with he guy who head butted him?
That is for you to see. But there is so much more.
I rented it on Video on Demand where it was lovely to watch.
My partner and I watched it over and over again.

Yes it's a rough movie to experience.
Yes there is sex for those interested, we were.
Yes it's a movie with a deep meaning and lesson for
Everyone out there to learn from, then enjoy.
I highly recommend Shank again and again.

Why are there so few good ones? It makes me want to become a producer just so I can help the genre out... Is it really that hard to make a good gay film. Well Shank & Boy Culture show that it can be done.
The english accents at the beginning of Shank are a bit rough, but you really don't have understand what they are saying to get the gist of what is going on.  Got to give perks to the lead female for her acting, I really wanted to crawl into the movie and hurt her, so she was pretty good at being a bitch.  But the male actors , well they were outstanding  & did I mention hot, hot, hot!  Especially the lead.

3978304,4,B002S46VCC,"This movie has a good plot. Its about a guy in a gang. It has a very gang-like feel. The music is good and the guys play their various parts well.

The movie is highly sensual especially in the beginning. The main character is very good at arousing his audience. Young men in the movie had good bodies. But the movie was not very generous at showing male frontal nudity. There were quite a few times it could have given us more but it did not. While the movie was senual it didn't give many opportunities to see their genitals. I can only remember two scenes although there were many more opportunities.

The movie contains drug use. There is a rape scene, violence, several sodomy scenes, little frontal nudity, and oral.

I don't know if the genitals could be seen very well because i bought ON DEMAND, which i do not recommend.

The movie was good and very sensual but it would have been better if it had been a little more generous with the frontal nudity.

******** BEWARE OF THE ON DEMAND VERSION *******************************************************

Amazon ON DEMAND is not good. I certainly WOULD NOT buy a video through them at the prices they want. The quality is HORRIBLE!

1) I've watched 2 movies with ON DEMAND neither one was clear. I thought I'd try another to be sure it was NOT the movie. The pictures are not sharp and you may have to spend time adjusting the lighting get the best picture.

2) Although the UnBox player will allow you to maximize the picture to fill the screen, the resolution Amazon provides is not good enough to benefit from the feature. They give you just enough but nothing more. When i maximized the screen, the movie was HORRIBLE. I could not tell the different between the people and the white wall behind them. Sunlight was too bright and prevented the people from being seen.  So the movie has to be watched without the greatest possible viewing space.

3) The subtitles weren't always legible because of the bad resolution and quality of the downloads. Don't expect the picture to be BETTER than the preview online. I thought that downloading the movie would be at a higher resolution thereby providing a better quality than the quick preview. I WAS WRONG!

4) There was no option for subtitles. You have very little control over the movie.

Unless you want something quick or you want to sample the movie before buying it, I don't recommend using ON DEMAND!

If yo don't use it, they will either ditch it or provide better quality!",1265846400,5,2483,4.628701594533029
