8330020,2,B001OAA74E,I agree with other reviews that art work is brilliant......message is sort of clear and very repetitive. If you are advanced in spiritual pactices you will not benefit a lot....but it is my personal opinion.,1374451200,,207,4.942857142857143
8330021,5,B001OAA74E,"This is a truly work of art, not just for the amazing graphics by Jean-Luc Bozzoli that brings the viewer traveling through space and time, full of spiritual ancient and modern symbols, but because of the profound narratives by Dr. James J. Hurtak, a very knowledgeable and spiritual scientist, the really guides you through a meditational journey of Divine Wisdom and learning. You will never repent of having this DVD and will want to watch it often!",1363478400,,452,4.883116883116883
8330022,4,B001OAA74E,"I love the Hurtak dvds . They are very relaxing yet spiritual. This is one of my favourites. Second to ""The Light Body""",1273276800,,119,4.217391304347826
