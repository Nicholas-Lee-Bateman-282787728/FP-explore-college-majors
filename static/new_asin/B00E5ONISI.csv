5891650,1,B00E5ONISI,It was ok. I was extremely disappointed with the amount i paid for a short story. I was under the impression of a full length movie boy was I wrong. I wasn't very impressed with the story line either. Nothing to build on in my opinion.,1393891200,6,235,4.130434782608695

8601540,5,B00E5ONISI,"What it is: two 35-min short films in German that are lesbian-themed.

The first film, The Mermaids, is about a geeky woman who joins an American-style football team.

Why I love this film:
- It's a romantic comedy that is funny, sweet and clever
- The women are quite attractive
- It's about football! (I love it when women get to play football)
- The soundtrack is original for the film and  (I especially like the Mermaids fight song is a fun punk-inspired tune)

My only regret: That there aren't any follow-ups planned,..",1503100800,,526,4.623655913978495

8601545,5,B00E5ONISI,"I rented this short film on youtube for 2 dollars and loved it so much I had to own it. It's your standard adorable sports-themed romantic comedy but with girls who like girls (and it's in German). Frankly, if directors want to do this to every single cheesy romcom plotline out there, I will be right here with my credit card and my popcorn. There's also a bonus short film by the same director on the DVD. It's about a graffiti artist with an anxiety problem, and it's charming and fun.",1475971200,3,488,4.373626373626373
