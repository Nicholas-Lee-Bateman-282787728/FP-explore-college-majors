8615744,5,B00FH2PFUQ,"(James) Cagney and (Humphrey) Bogart do not disappoint in this classic 1939 Western. I first saw this on HBO years ago and fell in love with Cagney's talent. Allegedly this is their first actual film together as costars.

Cagney stars as Jim Kincaid or ""The Oklahoma Kid"" - the area's 'Robin Hood' of sorts, opposite Bogart's notorious gun-slinging outlaw, Whip McCord. McCord leads a gang of outlaws to rob a stagecoach carrying Indian payout, which Kincaid intercepts. McCord then illegally stakes out free territory, is busted by Judge Kincaid, then stages a plan to frame the judge for murder, as Jim steps in once again to 'save the day'.

For a remastered classic, the sound, action, and dialogue are dead accurate. Some B/W classics are not so lucky. This film also costars Rosemary Lane; who found success as a film star during the 1940's, as Jane Hardwick; Kincaid's flirt interest, and Donald Crisp as Judge Hardwick.

And yes, this is yet another Cagney classic featuring a Romance squeezed in with good Western action. But we like those.",1398211200,4,1049,4.915254237288136
8615745,5,B00FH2PFUQ,I first saw this movie as a kid. At that time I really didn't know the stars. With me Cagney was better known as a tough guy (Gangster roles). When really he could do it all. Bogart with me was a tough guy (P.I.). To see these two in a western role was different. This is a good cowboy flick. I recommend Cagney & Bogart fans who haven't saw this one to check it out. For those have saw this movie now it's available in DVD form to add to your collection.,1388275200,4,455,3.9565217391304346
8615746,4,B00FH2PFUQ,Was a good remast of a classic. Cagney and Bogart were pretty young. Quality was fine and no hitches. Always looked for remastered versus copies,1384300800,2,144,4.8
