8642364,5,B00IIK6BUM,"Important note to buyers: This product is a Region 2 DVD. Which means that to view it properly, the best solution would be to either buy a Region free DVD player or to download a free software called VLC player. A wonderful software which has allowed me to view on my computer or laptop movies from all over the world.

Another portion of ten episodes from ""Shaun the Sheep""'s third season, this set has again the Mossy Bottom Farm flock getting into another round of mayhem while making sure the farmer doesn't unmask their not docile lives. A parasitic crow who invades the barn, a hard-to-crack-open coconut, a very defensive duck mother, and a shepherd competition, these are some of the adventures Wallace and Gromit's former companion has to live with.

Ironically enough, this DVD also offers a never before aired episode that if it passed on German television in 2012, it never went on British airwaves. Called ""Let's Spray"", this episode involves the lamb Timmy and Shaun who, after uncovering some spray paint bottles, decide to use them around the farm, at the expense of Bitzer who has to clean up their mess. On the web, I remember that many were discussing on why this episode never passed on UK TV. So far, the most common explanation people have had is that maybe TV executives were afraid that characters spraying graffittis everywhere could be seen as a bad example for children. Of course no official explanation was ever given, but personally, considering the several instances of TV executives censorship in the animation business  as several of those people unfortunately tend to underestimate the intelligence of the viewers while implementing theories and ideas that can hurt the creativity of many artists  I think this theory could be plausible.

In its special features, Shaun the Sheep also offers several making-of on the animation of ""Shaun the Sheep"". Through the animators, the directors, the Golly, and an animation software being presented, people finally get to learn how the episodes are done.

Nice treat for all fans of Stop-motion animation, this set of episodes is another proof of Shaun the Sheep's well-deserved success.",1437696000,,2162,4.991666666666666
