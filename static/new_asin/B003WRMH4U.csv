4214440,4,B003WRMH4U,"Touching, if a bit melodramatic, this Indonesian film about the growing friendship between a prostitute
hiding from her violent pimp and a dying portrait photographer weighed down by a lifelong secret is lovely
to look at, gentle, with a good heart.  It's film I wish I loved even more.

The intentions are wonderful, but the tendency to go over the top with the acting (especially the old man),
and the fact you could see where the story was heading for quite a while kept a lid on my enthusiasm.  So
did the emotional distance of the style and very slow pace (and I love slow movies).  All that said, it was good
enough that I will see it again, and discover if it pulls me in deeper next time, knowing ahead of time the
very low-key approach to the story, and the slightly heightened performances (an odd, interesting contradiction there).",1302912000,6,842,4.593333333333334

4214450,5,B003WRMH4U,"I love the fact that I can scroll through Amazon's Prime film offerings and come upon gems like this 2007 Indonesian film, ""The Photograph"". Directed by Nan Achnas, this film stars Shanty as Sita, a young woman who works in a karaoke bar and also moonlights as a prostitute. She struggles to eke out a living so that she can support her young child and mother back in her village. Abused and hounded by her pimp, Sita moves out of her old place and rents a spare room in an old portrait photographer's place. The photographer, played by veteran Singaporean actor, Lim Kay Tong, and Sita form a close bond and the movie explores how their relationship impacts both of their lives.

The film comes with English subtitles and as someone who speaks Indonesian (thanks to growing up and living in the region), I can say that for the most part the translation is sufficient. Also, this film moves at a really slow pace and is not meant to be watched in a hurry - the gestures, facial expressions, body language, all work in tandem to enhance the storytelling. I watched this on an early Sunday morning while all the other members of my family were asleep, and I was able to fully immerse myself in the movie. It is a little gem of a film (obviously filmed on a low budget) that explores human relationships and how everyday people struggle with issues of identity and existence as they go through the motions of getting by in this often cruel and unforgiving world. Recommended.",1422748800,7,1472,4.575757575757576
4214451,5,B003WRMH4U,A great symbolic movie which presents conflicting human emotions in a very beaitiful soft but questioning manner.  I enjoyed the movie which focuses on dimensions of love.,1420156800,,171,5.333333333333333
4214452,5,B003WRMH4U,"This what I consider a 'quiet' movie - laid back, emotional, getting into the minutae of everyday lives, seeing what makes the characters behavior.  Thoroughly enjoyed it, although it did seem to take a bit to ""get off the ground"" storywise in the beginning.",1420070400,,258,4.863636363636363

8407501,4,B003WRMH4U,"I enjoyed this film, even though I missed some of the dialog.  I tried various settings of aspect ratio but I was unable to find a setting that allowed me to fully view the English subtitles, so there was some dialog that I missed out on.  Despite that, I was still drawn in to the story line and I would like to see it again with subtitles being fully available to me.  This is a well crafted film with great character development.",1469923200,,432,4.2439024390243905
8407502,4,B003WRMH4U,"This is a beautifully executed tender Indonesian film. It tells the story of a down-and-out young prostitute/ singer who earnestly attempts to support her family, and the elderly ailing photographer who reluctantly takes her in. It is skillfully written and directed (Nan Achnas) and edited (Sastha Sunu) with exquisite photography (Yadi Sugandi) of sensuous landscapes, urban interiors and authentic characters.  Religious symbols, rituals, and artifacts, including photographs, play an important visual and thematic role; but I was unable to identify which religion--possibly Taoism or Chinese folk religion as Mr Johan ( Lim Kay Tong), I think, is portrayed as Chinese-Indonesian. Also key is the belief that one must satisfy the promises to the ancestors before one dies. Tong's acting is solid, as is that of the other lead, Shanty, who plays Sita. This is not a film that races to the end. It's gait is slower, more restrained, but appropriately . A very good film, well worth a viewing.",1468886400,,993,5.245283018867925
