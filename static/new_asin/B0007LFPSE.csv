8048230,1,B0007LFPSE,"My 6 mo old loves your baby can read dvds. They are great and I wish they had some dvds with emphasis on numbers, too (Your baby can count??). In the market for a learning dvd on numbers, I stumbled upon baby bumblebee numbers dvd. AWFUL. It isto sooooooooo slow (as in drawn-out speaking slow...so tortuous), boring, not entertaining. First, the music is very drawn out. Even the people speaking in the video speak verg monotonic. And the singing? Gosh, awful singing! Wish they can spice it up with more upbeat people or use music that's catchy.

Even though my child is only 6 mo, she knows which DVD sucks (looks elsewhere, wiggles out of her bumbo) and which is more entertaining (sits in her Bumbo, eyes glued to the your baby can read dvds). I am no spokesperson for YBCR nor do I absolutely love their products but the YBCR songs are very catchy, entertaining, and thus, keep your child's attention longer for the learning to take place.",1345334400,,945,4.591715976331361
8048231,3,B0007LFPSE,"It's along the same lines as Baby Einstien, but not as good. Slower, not as entertaining but still gets the point across, if you can get them to sit and watch it. I use it as a before bedtime movie.",1167782400,3,198,3.975
8048232,5,B0007LFPSE,"Great video with lots of colorful video examples on how to count from 1 to 5.

My daugther loves to watch it.

A lot better than the Baby Einstein ones.",1125964800,11,152,4.033333333333333
