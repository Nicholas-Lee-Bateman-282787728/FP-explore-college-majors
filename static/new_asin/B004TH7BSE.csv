8465627,1,B004TH7BSE,"This was a featured item that was emailed to me based on my preferences, and boy did I learn my lesson! It sounded like a great collectors item, right up my alley, and fairly Inexpensive-so I ordered it.
It arrived fairly quickly, as do most Amazon items. Upon putting the disc in the player a few days later, it kind of seemed like a home copy the way the title came up and no previews before an odd, blue, title screen. After watching the film for 20-30 minutes, I realized it's not the correct film! It's in color & Donald Sutherland was in it-which was a cheesy '70's film. The package even states black & white-and has no original artwork or poster.
Mistakes happen but the problem I face is it was too inexpensive to bother sending back and fighting for a refund. Yet I'm out just under $20 and stuck with a worthless DVD!
BUYERS BEWARE!
It wouldn't let me not put in NO STARS!",1304035200,,883,4.325301204819277
8465628,1,B004TH7BSE,"I ordered the movie Lady Ice by George Romero, it's an old zombie movie done in black & white and I keep getting another movie called lady ice. The dvd box I get says Lady Ice by George Romero but it's a crappy 70's movie disc. It won't let me get a refund of my money, all i can do is return it for another one. I've gotten the wrong movie two times now, I can't get my money back and I cant get the movie I ordered, I have been buying items from amazon.com for years and have spent alot of money on this site, you would think Amazon would take care of there loyal customers, but I guess not?",1303171200,,593,3.909090909090909
8465629,1,B004TH7BSE,"This is Night of the Living Dead with a different name.  Whoever is putting this out is just trying to trick you into buying it.  Night of the Living Dead is unfortunately in the public domain so anyone can make their own version of it to try and make money.  Changing its name, though, is the lowest trick I've seen.  DON'T BUY THIS.",1302048000,2,334,4.253968253968254
8465630,1,B004TH7BSE,"I cannot find any information about this movie except what Amazon has on its' website.  Looked at George Romero's Bio nothing about this movie, checked Judith O'Dea's web Bio again nothing listed about this particular movie.  SO BUYERS BEWARE!!  I CANNOT FIND ANY INFO REGARDING LADY ICE...

If someone comes across any info please post on AMAZON.
