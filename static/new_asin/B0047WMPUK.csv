8418426,4,B0047WMPUK,"I was obligated to get this documentary because my first day ever on a track was at Lime Rock Park, where I received some really great training from pro racers.  The documentary does a sensitive and accurate job of contextualizing Lime Rock Park with respect to its geographic and historic setting.  Through interviews with several racers, it also gives a good sense of why some people are irresistibly compelled to race.

Where I think the documentary falls a bit short (and thus my rating of 4 stars) is in describing the technical design of the track and the specifics of how it should best be driven with different types of cars.  Maybe the creators of this documentary thought that would be beyond the understanding or interest of the audience, but I would disagree there.  If you're going to make a whole documentary on a single race track, I think a detailed technical analysis of the track is a must.

As another quibble, the credits greatly exaggerate the role of Paul Newman, since his appearance in the movie is so brief that it's almost not even worth mentioning.

Nevertheless, overall I did quite enjoy this documentary, and can recommend it to racing enthusiasts, particularly people with ties specifically to Lime Rock Park.",1333670400,3,1240,4.848341232227488
