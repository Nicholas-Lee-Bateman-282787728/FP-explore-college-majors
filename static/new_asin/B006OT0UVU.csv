5011211,5,B006OT0UVU,"The packaging and cover are misleading, suggesting a D movie hack job but WOW! what an amazing, mind-blowing horror film. In league and style of Jorworsky's ""Holy Mountain"" meets ""Evil Dead"" and ""texas chainsaw massacre"", ""Season in Hell""(the actual title) is a trippy homage to the 70s horror masterpieces! Its like the filmmakers ate 'shrooms and gleefully threw in everything but the kitchen sink! Vampire lesbians, evoking Franco's ""Vampyrso lesbos"", a slew of Russ Meyer Vixens, and a
journey to hell as if Pink Floyd sucked you there! Not greta with plot but thats not the point, you've seen all the originals so why rehash like countless others? Passantino and company have created a MIX TAPE of the best of 70s horror blending it in a fun mind bending experience up there with Fincher and Crispin Glover's films.",1331596800,,820,4.949275362318841
5011212,4,B006OT0UVU,"Wow i hate torture porn type movies, but this was great because its fun, A couple of stranded motorists stumble upon a lonely guy who lives in a cabin in the woods. He has a group of captive woman who worship him & kill for him & he has another group of prisoners, the stranded motorists are caught in the middle when at one point they all do battle, a very interesting spin indeed, and something ive never seen done before Kudos for a brilliant story & great suspense & gore, this movie has it all I highly recommend it, if you dig stuff Like Last house on the left, Texas Chainsaw Ect..GET THIS MOVIE ITS WORTH IT!",1329696000,5,616,4.228813559322034
8502286,1,B006OT0UVU,"This isn't just a low-budget movie. It's a NO BUDGET MOVIE. I mean, it's like the result of a  child playing around with an old video cam. I wouldn't call the effects special, absolutely not, no way, no how. This is the worse movie I've seen in.....EVER.

I'm not even sure this is a movie.",1378598400,,290,4.254545454545455
8502287,4,B006OT0UVU,"This was a great horror flick, complete with a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere...crazy people abound, & the main characters try to escape. It gets weirder as the story goes on...this should be a cult classic if it isn't already. Good times.",1374969600,,243,4.674418604651163

8502291,4,B006OT0UVU,Here's an indie movie that harkens back to some of the classic flicks back in the day. YOu can see some of the influences but that's fine by me. I dug it.,1362441600,,154,3.84375
8502292,1,B006OT0UVU,This film is old and not as good as the horror movies of today. Do not recommend it because it just doesn't compare with so many good ones out there.,1356566400,,149,4.0
8502293,1,B006OT0UVU,"This movie takes the title for worst horror movie I have ever seen! The background audio  is just atrocious and renders the film almost unwatchable by drowning out the actors and does absolutely nothing to enhance the viewing experience(just think the sound of Freddie Kruegers knife fingers amplified by 100 playing through a feedbacking marshall stack!)The acting is horrible but that is to be expected of a low budget indy production. The plot is never developed and the movie quickly descends into random images that make no sense. The pics on the back of the box are not even in the movie!! I have seen many low buget productions that overcame the lack of financial resources to deliver a decent cinematic product. Unfortunately this low budget ""movie"" is a real STINKER and a waste of time and money. STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS CINEMATIC DISASTER!",1342310400,,854,4.8493150684931505

In plain words this (HORROR) movie SUCKED BIG TIME - it was a hugh waist of money. I watched about 15 mins. & could not believe that anyone would attempt to make this CRAP .I FF through the rest of the flick hoping it might get better - BUT NO LUCK. At that point i removed the CD from my CD player & put it in my trash can & out it went . That will be the very last time that i purchase a movie based on your customers reviews. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.

I had to rate this item in order for it to send SO just disregard the one star. The movie SUCKS",1338508800,,811,4.75177304964539
8502295,5,B006OT0UVU,"This movie was so cool. It takes you back to the late 70's and early 80's of glorious , classic horror. It has it all !! Heroics, fights, masked,axe swinging behemoths , beautiful scream queens ( even a huge battle of beautiful scream queens !!) I looked up the credits and got the character name of the big dude with the freaky mask !!GROMMEL !! What an awesome name !!It would not be a bad idea for them to do a spin off trilogy of that character alone !!He would make a sick action figure. Total collector's item. This is definitely a stocking stuffer when the holidays come back around for any horror fan. You'll watch this and will want to grab a movie camera and film your own horror movie. Totally inspiring !!",1331596800,,717,4.358208955223881
