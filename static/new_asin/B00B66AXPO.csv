8563189,5,B00B66AXPO,"The genius of indie film maker Frank Ladner is now available for all to enjoy!  Indie film making requires a ""jack of all trades"" type personality.  Frank Ladner most definitley displays his skills set in this film, writing, directing, cinematography, editing, visual effects and even acting, as one of the main characters, Leland Walles.

HNB is a sci-fi mockumentary that at times seems like a real documetary.

This is a slow moving, relaxing film to watch.  The cast of local characters from the deep south are added one at a time giving you a chance to get to know them.  Part of the beauty of HNB is that these are all just local folks, not actors.  Even knowing this you find yourself believing every word they say, well most of what they say anyway. Their wit and humor is most often understated but always hilarious.

I would highly recommend this to all and look forward to Frank Ladner's next project!

By the way, I just ordered my second copy of HNB because the first one is still being passed around and viewed by all of my friends.",1424736000,2,1046,4.550802139037433
8563190,5,B00B66AXPO,"A fantastic film!  The camerawork and different cinematic styles utilized are quite refreshing.  At some moments, it feels like ""District 9"", quickly shifting gears into a montage that someone like Wes Anderson would put together.  The documentary-style is quite different and humorous, and there are numerous sections in the film that inspire hysterical laughter.  A must-watch for filmmakers trying to learn how to make the most of their medium!",1395878400,,447,5.434782608695652
8563191,4,B00B66AXPO,"I expected a typical ""found footage"" effort  complete with stock characters and boring stretches of needless walking scenes etc. What i found was a wonderfully written movie with compelling characters. The lead even has a character arc! In all seriousness this was a great little indie horror/sci-fi film with a thoughtful premise, writing and performances that keep you from noticing when there are no :""horror"" scenes happening. Highly recommended.",1392422400,2,450,5.521739130434782
8563192,5,B00B66AXPO,I was impressed. The acting is suburb with wonderful characters. The plot development always leaves you wanting to believe. The comical moments almost seem unintended. This is the first movie i've recommended to friends in a long time.,1378857600,,235,5.2105263157894735
8563193,5,B00B66AXPO,"Monsters, myth and militia collied at the crossroads in a battle of wits and grits in HICKORY NEVER BLEEDS, a Southern-fried send-up that breathes new life and welcomed laughs into the mockumentary genre.

Filmmaker Frank Ladner, the mastermind of ceremonies behind this micro-budget indie gem, sends us on a backwoods road trip to what feels like forgotten territory tucked away somewhere between the reality TV's ""Duck Dynasty"" and a PBS special on UFO sightings, yet manages to avoid current trends that make most cable shows unwatchable.

The director, who has a keen eye for setting and mood, trades gimmicky editing and whiz-bang camera work in favor of lingering takes and artful cinematography. Good thing, too, because his local cast chew up scenes with hilarious one-liners and genuine performances, including Ladner himself; not only does he orchestrate the madness from behind the camera's lens, he joins the fun as a character in front of it, playing a loner crackpot of monster lore as well as delivering some of the movie's choicest chuckles. If you don't bust into giggles or at least crack a smile during a few of his ramblings, you might want to check your pulse. And I especially appreciate that some of the film's on-camera subjects are as crusty and creaky as the locations they inhabit. The real estate adage holds true here: location, location, location.

This brisk 79 minutes of lore, lunacy and smart storytelling are loaded with nutty neighbors, conspiracy kooks, loopy dog ladies, monster minutemen, scheming goat farmers, earthbound creature-huggers, and an ernest graphic artist impassioned to organize his fellow friends under the mother of all monikers. All of which are wrapped up nicely in a DVD that boasts packaging in keeping with the movie's low-key aesthetic, a simple yet spot-on menu, extras you'll be compelled to watch, and your very own slick ""Monster Defense Team"" sticker. Take that, you beasts!

For this viewer there was only one performance that felt out of place, which could be the result of miscasting, and my attention was stretched thin for what I'm guessing was only a few minutes tops. But those are microscopic dings in an otherwise flawlessly spit-shined project. Ladner and Co. should be proud of this bootlace-budget first feature effort HICKORY NEVER BLEEDS and I can only hope he and his posse have a successful festival run with it... and beyond!

HICKORY NEVER BLEEDS is a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining and charming sketch of small-town citizens embracing their scrappy sensibilities and pulling together against all oddities.

For the filmmaker geek: image and audio are both firing on all pistons.

For the skeptic: if you're not a fan of the genre and talking heads, interviews, and B-roll with voiceover don't do much for you, there's a good chance you might be won over.

For the fan: Monster Defense Teams across the world... unite!

For the collector: a no-brainer must-have DVD. (but if you do have a brain, and know how use it, you'll purchase a copy and join the resistance!)",1363564800,4,3054,5.067729083665339
8563194,5,B00B66AXPO,"Shoestring budget.  No professional actors, crew, etc.  Good job by all the local talent.  This movie has a niche in my collection of keepers. Wonderful!",1361577600,5,153,5.04
