2354207,4,B000A2XC3A,"The Flesh Eaters is one of those great movies that was filmed in minimal time (less than a week) and yet manages to tell the story well without fancy sets.  A pilot is hired to take an actress and her assistant South despite an approaching storm.  Soon they need to make a forced landing on a seemingly deserted island.

On the island they meet a marine biologist who is doing some research.  But son danger raises its head as skeletons are found on the shore.  There seems to be something in the water that can stip a body to the bones.  The scientist seems to know more than he is saying.  Tension builds and desperation takes hold until the climax of the film and the final battle.

It was a pleasure to see the movie complete again as it has always been hacked up on TV.  Also included on the disk is a scene that was cut and some variations including some nude scenes.  It is really amazing how well the film works with almost no sets, just sand dunes and beaches.  A true classic of its era and one that still holds its own.",1141430400,,1030,4.230769230769231
2354208,4,B000A2XC3A,"Apparently there may be a couple of different version of the film The Flesh Eaters (1964) floating around, but this is the only one I've ever seen, so it's the only one I can comment on...I do want to take a moment to thank another Amazon reviewer named Charles, who very clearly, and appreciatively, delineated the differences between the DVD version that was originally supposed to be released, versus the version that eventually was released.  Written by Arnold Drake (Who Killed Teddy Bear), and directed by Jack Curtis, whom some may know through the late 60s animated series Speed Racer (English version) as the voices of Pops Racer, Lionel Racer, Inspector Detector, and others, the film features perennial silver screen Nazi villain Martin Kosleck (Bomber's Moon, 36 Hours, Morituri) and daytime soaper Byron Sanders (""The Doctors"", ""Search for Tomorrow""), who, apparently, was the model for Salvador Dali's oil painting ""The Crucifixion"".  Also appearing is Barbara Wilkin (I Saw What You Did), Rita Morley (""The Edge of Night""), and Ray Tudor, whose only other film credit is a movie titled Five the Hard Way (1969), better known to Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans as The Sidehackers, featuring the indomitable Ross Hagen, who doesn't not appear in this film.

The movie opens on a young couple frolicking on a good-sized boat.  They end up going for a swim, followed by some ominous, yet kookie sound effects...that can't be good...and it isn't, for the couple, at least.  Next we're at a seaport somewhere in New York City (see the Empire State Building in the skyline?) and we meet a hunky, granite jawed, all American charter sea pilot named Grant Murdoch (Sanders).  Seems Grant's has some fiduciary issues (he's in hock up to his eyeballs), and is forced to accept a business proposition to fly a boozy actress named Laura Winters (Morley), and her buxomlicious secretary Jan Letterman (Wilkin) to a place called Provincetown, despite a wicked awesome tropical storm moving into the area.  The trio take off, but soon run into difficulties as the plane's engine conks out, and they had to set down on the beach of what they believe to be an uninhabited island...turns out the island isn't completely uninhabited as no sooner do they land than they meet Professor Peter Bartell (Kosleck), a marine biologist camped on the beach studying shellfish, or so he claims.  The group shacks up in the Professor's tent while the storm blows over, some stuff happens, the plane is eventually lost, Ms. Winters is in need of her `medicine (one of her suitcases, left on the plane, was filled with nothing but booze), the beach is cover with the bones of fish corpses, and Grant begins to suspect the Professor has more of an interest on the island than just crustaceans.  Soon it's discovered the waters around the island are teeming with microscopic, parasitic flesh eating life forms, and the group has no means of escaping.  But wait, there's some dingus on a raft coming towards the island, a really annoying hepcat, beatnik, be-bopping fool named Omar (Tudor), who sadly makes it to the beach intact...eventually Bartell's relationship with the parasitic creatures along with his evil plans becomes clear, all leading up to a real doozy of a finale.

This movie definitely had its flaws, the main one being the didactic, expository scripting, but in terms of sleazy, schlocky sci-fi cinema, it most definitely hit the spot.  One of my favorite scenes involved Grant getting some of the parasites on his leg, and Professor Bartell performing some on the beach surgery with his knife...after removing the creatures from Grant's badly injured leg, Bartell yells to Jan for bandages, to which she promptly removes her shirt...hello eye candy...hotchie mama!  Okay, she was wearing a bra, but still, you gotta love a woman of action, willing to doff her clothing in a time of need.  As far as the performances, I thought most did very well (I really hated Tudor's beatnik character, but found solace in his eventual fate).  Were they predictable?  Perhaps, but predictable with flair... Kosleck's played a similar character in numerous films, but I never seem to get tired of it...you wacky mad scientist types, how could I not love you?  As far as Sanders, well, he just seemed like a soap opera actor in a sci-fi/horror film, his strong features placing him squarely in the role of the hero.  I think my favorite character was of Laura Winters, played by Rita Morley.  I couldn't decide if I liked her character better drunk or sober.  Drunk, she was pretty funny, while sober, she was kinda smarmy, condescending, and just a lot of fun to watch.  Some aspects of the film didn't really jibe for me, like after Grant's incident with the parasitic creatures chewing up his leg and subsequent hack surgery, we see him bounding about like he was never hurt (perhaps the filmmakers forgot to tell him he was supposed to be injured, or his character was a quick healer).  Also, if Ms. Winters was the complete boozehound she was made out to be, I would have fully expected her to be suffering from a serious case of the D.T. (delirium tremors) once she was cut off...one last thing, what the hell was Bartell doing with a giant solar collector on the beach?  Ah well, given how much fun I had with the rest of the film, I suppose these were relatively minor points.  The special effects were pure bargain basement, mostly involving someone manipulating the film negative (scratching it or such), but it worked for me (when you're dealing with minimal budgets, you sometimes have to resort to the most economical methods).  The creature effects near the end were most excellent, and I was surprised to see a couple of fairly gory sequences.  All in all, given this was director Curtis' one and only film, I'd say it was one hell of an effort, and definitely worth checking out if you dig this sort of thing.  One interesting credit has Radley Metzger as the film editor here...if you're unfamiliar with Metzger, he's basically one of the pioneers of adult cinema, and the inspiration for Burt Reynolds' character in the Paul Thomas Anderson Boogie Nights (1997).

The widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic picture on this Dark Sky Films DVD release is most excellent in terms of clarity, much better than I would have expected, and the audio is very clear.  Extras include two trailers for the film, along with a deleted, lurid, Nazi experiment sequence, and outtakes.  It seems Fred Olin Ray's Retromedia group was originally going to release this DVD, and they even got film historian Tom Weaver to do a commentary track, but that didn't make it to this release, which is too bad as I'm sure he would have a lot of interesting bits of information to relate.

By the way, the artwork on the DVD case for this film may give the impression the film is in color, but it's not...it's glorious black and white, through and through (I guess there was a color sequence near the end in one version of the film, but that's not the version on this DVD).",1133308800,17,7053,4.841930116472546
2354209,4,B000A2XC3A,"A drunken movie actress, her sexy female assistant and a pilot get stranded by a storm on an island with a weird scientist who's experimenting with a strange flesh eating form of microscopic sea life. 40's film villain Martin Kosleck is the scientist with fiendish Nazi-tinged intentions while the rest of the cast are unknowns who actually manage to give performances. The film is a low-budget oddity that made the drive-rounds when I was a kid but I wasn't old enough to see it. I remember the gruesome ads though. Now here it is in near mint condition and Widescreen. ""Flesh Eaters"" isn't as gory as rumor would have it but it still has enough shocks to make it a rarity for 1964. Plus it boasts two monsters that form when the little flesh eaters bond into one big flesh eater---then an even bigger one forms in the sea. The cast does pretty well and the script (when not down right silly) isn't bad at all. The special effects are OK (the little creatures glow) and there is one character who has a particularly gruesome death---pre ""Parasite"". All in all, not bad viewing for horror fans and those interested in seeing what a ""gore"" film was in 1964 (""Blood Feast"" notwithstanding) and those who remember Martin Koslek. I enjoyed it and I'm glad I watched the other reviews before making the purchase. ""Flesh Eaters"" would have been no fun at all in a cut version.",1131235200,3,1370,4.595918367346939
2354210,4,B000A2XC3A,"As an avid fan of this movie, I have multiple versions of it ranging from the original Monterey VHS tape, various ""boot"" VHS tapes and DVDs, and finally both the MPI Dark Sky DVD (sold here) and a  Retromedia review copy DVD direct from the source.  Here are the findings based on independant research, viewing various versions, the Arnold Drake/Tom Weaver/Fred Olen Ray interview on the Retro disc, and from just flat out watching both DVDs side by side thanks to 2 DVD players, split screen, and lots of patience from my wife:

The MPI/Dark Sky DVD being sold here is Jack Curtis' original print/edit.  This same version was sold to TV in a very slightly edited version that was later released by Monterey Home Video in the 80's.  This is NOT the slightly edited TV print.  It IS the whole (original) shootin' match.

The Retromedia copy is the theatrical print/edit that basically had about 4 minutes of ""insert"" shots added by theatrical distributor Michael Ripps because I suppose he didn't think the film was shocking enough!  For ""artistic"" reasons (or more likely to accomdate the extra footage and keep the running time around 86 minutes), Ripps also re-edited some of the scenes to remove roughly 4 minutes of footage from Jack Curtis' cut.  Although touted as the ""uncut"" version, it is not uncut.

The MPI/Dark Sky DVD print IS missing the following compared to the Retro version:

1) A 2 second insert shot of a bloody hand in the opening sequence.

2) A 1.5 second insert shot of a white sign advertising ""SEAPLANE CHARTER FLIGHTS"" that was added to cover a scene edit.

3) A 4 second replacement shot with a close-up of ""Bartell"" twisting a knife into ""Miss Winters"".

4) A 4 second replacement shot with a close-up of ""Bartell"" inserting a hypo into ""Grant's"" arm.

5) About 3.5 minutes of the infamous Nazi flashback sequence, which replaced about 19 seconds of Bartell's flesh eater history speech.  This has been added as a bonus feature to the disc for those who wish to see it.

6) The red color-tinted ""blood in the eye"" sequence.  Here, it appears in black and white.  In the Retromedia interview, Arnold Drake says that Jack Curtis did the color tint sequence before the film was turned over for distribution, so in theory, it should be here as well.

With the added Nazi sequence as a bonus feature, the disc is only missing about 10 to 12 seconds of inserted/replaced footage that wasn't in the original movie to begin with and about 6 seconds of color tinting.

If you must have those 12 seconds of  (not really) cut footage, search eBay.  The ""DVDs"" sold there are usually the theatrical cut.

However, this version of the film includes everything else:  ALL the footage edited out from the theatrical version, all the blood, all the gore...the cutting of the flesh eaters out of Grant's leg, the skeleton supply boat captain, the see-through Omar, Bartell taking the ""easy"" way out...EVERYTHING.

The film looks better than it ever has and the audio is crisp and clear.  It appears Dark Sky had access to the original film elements whereas the theatrical print on the Retro disc looks a couple of generations removed.  The extras include the Nazi sequence with outtakes(!), and a couple of TV spots.  It is a five star disc all the way except that it is missing all the great special features the Retro disc was going to have.  Retro made it all available when Dark Sky was discovered to have full distribution rights.  What would've been nice is a 2-disc edition with both the director's cut and the theatrical cut with all the extras.  That would truly have been the definitive edition.

For not including the Retro bonus features (and possibly the theatrical cut as a bonus), I dock it a star.  I would dock it 2 stars but the film presentation is too good for this DVD to warrant a 3 star rating.",1130716800,69,3829,4.6741405082212255
2354211,5,B000A2XC3A,"The film opens with a guy and his gal taking a playful ocean swim near their boat. She splashes about, laughing while he jumps in. Her laughter turns to panic when he doesn't surface. She looks at her hands, now covered in blood. The screaming begins! Next, we are introduced to a drunken moviestar and her beautiful assistant. They're in need of an airplane. Enter the local sea-plane pilot, who takes the ladies aboard. Along the way, the plane conks out, forcing a landing on a small, seemingly uninhabited island. Our three castaways are soon met by a scientist who just happens to be up to no good! You see, he's a nazi, looking for a horrific experimental lifeform that sunk on board a german sub during WW II. You guessed it, he's looking for the FLESH EATERS! Thankfully, a perfectly stripped human skeleton washes ashore, bringing a smile to his face. He knows his critters are alive und vell! FLESH EATERS is a cool 1962 terror treat for lovers of sick cinema (like me). I especially enjoy Omar the beatnick and the plastered miss hollywood. They're annoyingly fun, and their death scenes are ghoulishly memorable. The little beasties themselves are a wonder of low-budget moviemaking! Pinholed into the actual film, they appear almost 3-D as they devour their prey. I'm still amazed by the scene where the scientist drops a couple of them into a test tube w/ tweezers. Today, they'd spend 10 zillion dollars to equal this effect! You gorehounds will get a warm feeling from the wet work in this one. Pretty gruesome for it's day!

2354212,1,B000A2XC3A,"Originally Retromedia was to release this uncut, with original colorized ending, and their disc would have had a ton of extra's including full lengnth commentary. According to Fred Olin Rays Message board (...), yes, you have to sign up to read posts.) the copywrite owner of the Flesh eaters sold the film first to MPI(under their new Dark Sky Films banner) and then sold it to F.O.Ray at Retromedia after that. After looking at the situation from a lawyers viewpoint, MPI had the right to release film to DVD, Not Retromedia. The fans have to suffer now because MPI have decided to not carry over (tho' F.O.Ray did offer the extra's to DarkSkyFilms)the extra's, the interviews and the audio-commentary. So, in essence this MPI DVD will be the ""edited for TV"" version shown on late night TV and once available on video in the 80's.
This is a true shame. This film in all its unedited glory is truely a gory, creepy, insane masterpeice of early 60's film making. Be on the look out on Ebay, Retromedia did send out about 50 ""review copies"" and some have turned up (about 3 months ago) on ebay.

The movie is a bit gorier than most at the time, but nothing unduly shocking by today's standards (no doubt this is why it doesn't get shown on TV).  The monsters' origin is interesting, and both the acting and writing were better than I'm used to for movies of this time period.  The monster isn't impressive when it appears as something larger than a shiny speck on the screen, and the way they killed it was a bit poor, but overall the movie was fun and a good buy.",1422662400,,562,4.233644859813084

2354239,4,B000A2XC3A,"""The Flesh Eaters"" starts out with the proverbial scantily clad young couple frolicking on the water in a boat. The guy playfully snatches off the girl's bikini top. In an attempt to cover herself she jumps in the water, he dives in after her, but he doesn't surface. A few seconds later she starts screaming as we see her flesh being eaten away. Then the film's title appears. ""The Flesh Eaters"" can be called one of the first true ""gore"" films. Released in 1962, shot in black & white, it's the definitive ""drive-in"" movie. It can be described as ""Outbreak"" meets ""Gilligan's Island"". The story starts with a hunky hired charter pilot (Byron Sanders) flying a middle-aged alcoholic actress (Rita Morley) and her young pretty assistant (Barbara Wilkin) to an engagement in Provincetown. The plane develops engine trouble (naturally), and makes an emergency water landing by a seemingly deserted island (naturally). Soon they discover the island does have one human resident, a marine biologist named Prof. Bartell (Martin Kosleck). Shortly after, they stumble upon a human skeleton washed up on shore. The skeleton is holding a bikini top in its hand. Hmmmmm. Where did that come from? Eventually they all realize there is something deadly in the water. The rest of the script is rather predictable, so there's no need for a *SPOILER ALERT*. Since there are only four people on the island, and it's a 90 minute film, a few incidental characters are brought in to provide the flesh eating victims in the interim. So we're introduced to a beatnik castaway who just happens to float his raft to shore, as well as the guy delivering supplies to the island. There's the usual heroine in distress (more than a few times), the macho hero to the rescue (also more than a few times), the mysterious diabolical madman, and the unsuspecting character who discovers the madman's evil plot. It'll make you think twice about the benefits of solar energy. The ending is rather ridiculous, but after all, this isn't ""Gone With the Wind"". Martin Kosleck is at his evil best as Professor Bartell. Kosleck is most remembered for playing Nazi soldiers in the 1940's. But I remember him more fondly for his roles is some of the Universal horror films of the same period (""House of Horrors"", ""The Mummy's Curse""). The Special Features on the DVD include two trailers for the film as well as a deleted sequence that shows Nazi experiments with the title deadly organisms. This sequence shows scientists making naked women jump into a pool that contain them. Over all, if you accept the film for what it is, it's quite entertaining. Although the gore is rather tame by today's standards, for a film that's over 50 years old, it was pretty shocking in it's day. It would be interesting if someone would re-make ""The Flesh Eaters"" today.",1370304000,5,2812,4.848232848232848

2354241,4,B000A2XC3A,"The Flesh Eaters(1964) is a low budget sci-fi-horror-thriller from director Jack Curtis and writer/comic book artist Arnold Drake. Several different people are trapped on an island during a hurricane. A dubious, ex-Nazi scientist(Martin Kosleck) could help them fight back against lethal, flesh eating organisms. For a movie made under rigid, US censorship in the 1960's, The Flesh Eaters has a fair share of blood and gore. Byron Sanders plays the story's straightforward hero and cute, sexy Barbara Wilkin plays the film's mild-mannered, wholesome heroine. She wears revealing clothes during the last hour of the film. Rita Morley plays Laura Winters, a washed up, drunk Hollywood starlet. Ray Tudor plays Omar, an irritating Beatnik.
Some people claim this film is a horror movie version of Gilligan's Island! Julian Stein composed the film's suspenseful, nail-biter music score. Radley Metzger edited the film. The Flesh Eaters hit movie theaters in March 1964 and over the years it's been shown on TV stations. AMC shows the film late at night. The Flesh Eaters was well-made considering its low budget.
Curtis and Drake use a little bit of comedy to take the edge off the film. In one scene, Laura Winters falls out of an airplane and into the ocean while stealing a suitcase full of liquor! A radio operator tells Grant Murdoch(Byron Sanders) that he's using his plane for a ""money transfusion, not a blood transfusion""! Martin Kosleck(from Alfred Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent) is quite good as the two-faced Professor Bartell. Most prints leave out the footage with the flesh eaters tested out on women. As with The Heroic Trio(1992), the film creates a comic book feel without actually using a comic book as source material.

I remember catching The Flesh Eaters as a kid growing up in the late 70's on WTOG's Creature Feature in Tampa.  All these years later, The Flesh Eaters remained in my memories years later.  I think it was the first movie where I saw a human skeleton and ran out of the house screaming. That is probably why I remember it. Anyway, modern horror fans will get a kick out of this because it covers so many different horror motifs.  First, you have Byron Sanders who plays the down-on-his-luck pilot, Grant Murdoch.  Sanders is a dead ringer for Bruce Campbell from the shape of his face to his classic one liners and even the same dead pan humor.  I can't believe how much Sanders reminded me of Campbell.  Then you have Martin Kosleck who plays the mysterious Proffessor Peter Bartell who has that creepy German accent that is so closely associated with Nazi stereotypes in film.  You also have the cute girl next door, Barbara Wilkin who plays Jan Letterman an assistant to the drunk and obnoxious Laura Winters played by Rita Morley.  Miss Winters needs a flight to make it to her next movie gig and Bryon Sanders desperately needs cash.  At first he is reluctant to go but is persuaded by the beautiful Barbara Wilkin.
 The four take off and are forced to land on a deserted island that is surrounded by flesh eaters that appear as strange glowing lights in the water.  With all the talk about the oil spill in the Gulf, The Flesh Eaters provides a much-needed relief from the news and current events.
 Soon the four meet the scary German, Prof Bartell, who you quickly suspect is up to no good.
 Then thanks to the treachery of Prof Bartell and the whining and complaining of Miss Winters and her drunken rants, everyone is stuck on the island and surrounded by flesh eaters.  Prof Bartell and Sanders discover a skeleton holding a bikini top and that is where I ran out screaming at the age of 6.
 The Flesh Eaters works on a number of different motifs.  You have Political Horror in Prof Bartell and hints of Nazi war atrocities. You have Survival Horror as those stuck on the island grate on each others nerves and put up with each other only to risk death as the flesh eaters inch their way closer and closer to the shoreline.  You have, the obvious, Environmental Horror, when those strange glowing living organisms that eat right through flesh and leave behind bones.
 It is interesting that a black and white movie made back in 1964 is still so entertaining.  After re-watching it all these years later, I'm in my late 30's now, the movie still hooks me in.  Just watch the first scene and the movie draws you in and keeps your attention right up to the end and beyond.

2354255,5,B000A2XC3A,"I consider myself quite the classic horror fan, so I'm surprised this one has flown under my radar for so long.  I'm glad I took a chance and picked it up, because it's quite a gem.  Several other reviews have given details of the film's production, edits and release problems.  I'd like to just focus on the movie itself, and the DVD.

I've always thought the best horror films were the low-budget ones that had to get by on atmosphere and sheer moviemaking invention.  Films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampyr-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00180R06I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampyr - Criterion Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead-Millennium-Edition/dp/B00005Y6Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)</a>, and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;work not because they have big budgets or stars' names above the credits.  They have the feel of a nightmare, one in which the viewer feels trapped and unable to overcome.  Such a film is The Flesh Eaters.  Even though you know on some level you are just watching a movie, the film draws you in and makes you feel you are there, living the nightmare.

And what a nightmare it is.  Some have called it the first gore film.  I'm not sure if that's true, but some scenes still pack a punch.  And the deceptively simple depiction of the title creatures (which appear to be holes punched in the film to let light bleed through) is surprisingly believable.  Even if the film's gore doesn't really hold up to the more realistic stuff that would be done 10 or 20 years from the time of its release, it's still fairly disturbing in the context of that time, when the results of violence were usually shown after the fact.

Having not seen the film before now, I can't compare the A/V quality with previous releases.  But I do know that it looks and sounds great for a nearly 50 year old low-budget horror film.  I played the disc on my Blu-ray player on a 32"" HDTV, and it certainly compares favorably to any of the higher-profile releases from the same time.

And be sure not to miss the deleted ""Nazi Experiments"" scene or the outtakes, which would get the film an ""R"" rating even now.  There are also a pair of theatrical trailers that probably scared many a moviegoer back in the 60's.

If I have any minor complaints about this release, it's that it did leave me wanting more.  I mean, in the way of behind-the-scenes information.  There's an insert in which writer/producer Arnold Drake marvels at the film's reputation, but that's it.  Still, the film is not to be missed, and I am now inclined to find out more about it.",1267228800,3,2867,5.468181818181818
2354256,5,B000A2XC3A,"Remembering seeing this film on tv in the mid 70's, I was attracted to watch it by the title alone. What I did see was one of the earliest forms of 'gore' films ever made.  I was suprised to see the amount of violence for such an old film.
After years of wondering if the film would be rebroadcast, i gave up hope, as it didn't.
Years later, I came upon a VHS copy of the film, and in all it's glory, was able to enjoy it again, with a bonus of almost 4 minutes of mostly silent footage of outtakes.
Then I did some research.
What I did find out about the film was amazing. Originally shot silent, it was overdubbed later. That answers why most of the dialog sounded crisper than what you would expect from a low budget film.
The film started production in 1960. It actually took almost 3 years to complete, as the producers and investors were hoping for an earlier release, it finally was in 1964. But by this time, gore films were starting to pop up, so this film was lost (but still turned a profit) among the drive-in circuit.
The quality of this release is excellent and worth the price of the item alone.",1247184000,,1110,4.235849056603773
2354257,4,B000A2XC3A,"Almost 45 years later, I can hear this screaming promo on KJR for ""Flesh Eaters"", and like the kids in Joe Dante's ""Matinee"", my horror-loving buddies & I could hardly wait for this to hit the locals screens. Frankly, though, I think this is one I'll always remember fondly, but ""never go home again"". It scared the bejeebers out of us when we were 12, though.",1201046400,,360,4.46969696969697
2354258,4,B000A2XC3A,"into grisly cinema.  A group of people get stranded on an island, surrounded by a sea of voracious flesh-eating organisms.  The mad scientist with them experiments on these organisms, and on the people he's stranded with.  He finally causes the organisms to mutate into a giant, gelatinous creature, whose appetites have magnified.  The erstwhile survivors figure out how to eliminate the mutation, thus saving themselves from death.

I saw this when I was but a wee lassie.  It is truly a grotesque and horrifying film (well, most of it is, anyway).  The scene with the scientist feeding the flesh-eaters to the Gilligan wannabe is truly horrible.  It is a forgotten classic in the genre of 60's horror films.  This film pushed the envelope, broke some barriers in what could be considered some really graphic bloody violence in horror.  This was no spoof, no men-in-suits walking carrots movie.  This is a real blend of suspense and horror, and well worth the investment.",1199059200,6,973,4.9813664596273295
2354259,5,B000A2XC3A,"The Flesh Eaters is one of the handful of ultra low-budget B-movie shockers made in the US in the 60's that rises above the din. First would be Night of the Living Dead, then the obscure William Shatner ""Esperanto"" opus - Incubus, third would be Carnival of Souls, and honorable mention goes to this film, The Flesh Eaters.

The Flesh Eaters is a textbook example that a very good (not great, not a ""masterpiece"" but entertaining and watchable) film can indeed be made on a shoestring. It has a decent script; nice direction; a handful of actors who in my opinion were quite good in their respective roles - especially the mad scientist and drunk actress chick; a few acres of shoreline and a tent for a location and set; and some crude barely passable but fun (and not the worst I've seen by a long stretch in similar films from this era) monster effects - that's it.

The film has withstood the test of time and like its peers I've cited is quite watchable today. This has to due with its edgier sensibilities - sexual undercurrents, and more explicit (but tame by today's standards) gore scenes. (Warning Spoiler) Some have criticized the last 3rd of the film in which the  flesh eating parasites morph first into a human-sized crab-like monster, and shortly thereafter an enormous Godzilla-sized monstrosity that must be defeated.  But I like the chance the film takes here, kinda delves into Japanese sci-fi land for a spell which was fun and unexpected.

The mad scientist here is particularly ruthless and not shy about offing people. The film plays with a number of conventions like this one.  I'm tempted to say that the film - at least the first 2/3rds, is an allegory about alcoholism. Probably not - but maybe.

Anyway, leave logic at the door... If you're they type who unfairly likes to criticize films made before computer graphics for using what they had available and likes to take amateur MST 3000 cheap shots, stay away.  This film is not for you. But if you are willing to give older films some latitude, The Flesh Eaters is ""a cut above"" B-move fun from an era when films had less pretensions and more energy and inventiveness - if not ""3D effects""...",1193529600,2,2172,4.652741514360313
2354260,5,B000A2XC3A,"For what it is, ""Flesh Eaters"" is nearly perfect, and would of been a far better choice for the Critereon folks looking for examples of B horror.  The film has it all.  A silly monster, mad (and horny) Nazi doctor, Beatnik guy who looks like he belongs on Dobie Gillis, jut jawed and windy hero who would give you the shirt off his back - as soon as his girl friend takes her's off (you'll see what I mean), drunk actress, blonde bimbo, and a ridiculous plot.  The acting itself makes this one a jaw-dropping must-see.  In fact, that's the movie's main attraction, since ""special effects"" costs were obviously kept to a minimum.  Most of these B movies usually have wooden acting, which is, granted, part of their charm.  Not so with ""Flesh Eaters,"" which goes in a different direction.  Seriously, everyone of the actors must of graduated with honors from the William Shatner School of Over-the-Top Overacting.  Special mention goes to Martin Koslick, who as the mad doctor has that particular role nailed down tight for All Time.  He could do Nazi Mad Doctor in his sleep.  But I'm not even sure he's a Nazi!  Whatever. Good stuff!",1190505600,,1133,4.64321608040201
2354261,2,B000A2XC3A,"Not having seen this film in 30 years or so I didn't remember much. I bought the DarSky version expecting the film to be your typical rendition of an older, low budget B & W film with a bad print and generally not very good looking. I recently got a 42"" Sonis Bravia LCD TV and have been watching some of my films on them. From Superman (78), The Birds, The Poseidon Adventur, Koyaanisqatsi and some others they all tended to not look as good as I expected. Surprisingly  The Flesh Eaters was one of the best looking of them when blown up to fill the whole screen. The photography, for the most part was crsip and clean without much graininess.
  As far as the story goes it was enjoyable with some pretty decent acting, even with some of the not so great dialogue. A couple funny lines and some corny characterizations add some amusement. The effects, alas, were disappointing if not slightly ambitious for this kind of film.",1190419200,,926,4.4674556213017755
2354262,5,B000A2XC3A,"The Flesh Eaters is a great movie. Not too many characters, but the ones who are on the screen make every second count. You got a mad scientist with a heavy German accent, a blonde cutie, an almost over the hill alcoholic actress, a strong silent type hero, and my favorite, the beatnik who arrives out of nowhere on a homemade raft. His lines are classic.

Here's a quick plot rundown. An actress and her assistant need a flight immediately. They charter a plane at three times the price because a storm is brewing. They take off, but are forced to land on an island. There they discover a scientist. They soon find themselves trapped on the island, because the water is full of 'flesh eaters', little animated crystal things that east everything but the bone. The scientist is really behind the whole thing as if you didn't already know. He devices a way to subdue the crytals with electricity, but he only ends up making a monster that is best described as a Jellyfish Cyclops.

This is a great movie with characters that I never get tired of. Here is a breakdown.

Our Hero the pilot - Check this guy's leaps when he fights the scientist on the sanddune and then when he leaps off the monster. He does this crazy Spider-Man thing. He must be seen to be believed. What I can't understand is, if the flesh eaters can eat through wood and metal to get to flesh, how does his wetsuit protect him??

The Blonde eye candy - She's a hottie with a great butt. Check her out when she runs up the hill in those VERY tight shorts. When our hero has a leg wound, she volunteers her shirt. As the pilot lays screaming in agony, watch as she slowly and carefully unbuttons her shirt. Once her shirt is off, then she shreds it for bandages. Do the buttons really need to be intact??

The Lush - I love the actress, she is so melodramatic ""Gentlemen I drink! Not social cocktails.... I REALLY DRINK!"" But thanks to her the rest of the cast discovers how the monster can be defeated. Now let me see if I got this right. The monster craves human flesh and eats everything down to the bone, but human blood injected straight into the eye will make it explode. OK, got it.

The Beatnik - ""Crazy Man! Can't you see? Love is the weapon! You got to cut down on sugar, alcohol, meat, and onions"" This guy rambles on and on and acts baked throughout his stint in the flick. Unfortunatly, thanks to the scientist, he is eaten from the inside out.

The Scientist - Evil incarnate in the form of a German scientist. He plans on cultivating the flesh eaters and then sell it to the highest bidder, no matter what country it is. He's as handy with his test tube as he is with his Luger. Of course we all know what happens to evil scientists in movies right??

The special features are very interesting. I can see how the Nazi flashbacks would have slowed down the movie, but it is a scene that must be appreciated. Nude women jump in a pool and are eaten to the bone. They even have outtakes, and we see bare butt and bare boobs. Got to love that.

All in all, this is a great movie and I enjoy it every time I watch it.",1179273600,,3094,4.302405498281787
2354263,3,B000A2XC3A,"...before Carpenter, that is.

This is one of the early classics of gore, perched right alongside THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE, HORROR OF PARTY BEACH, and the Herschell Gordon Lewis oeuvre.  Its reputation has suffered much during the years.  (Leonard Maltin, in his famous movie guide, gives it his next to worst rating).  But it is actually an effective little chiller worth seeking out by hardcore horror fans.

The performances are solid.  Rita Morley is very good in a low-rent version of Alexandra del Largo.  Kosleck is appropriately unctuous.  And young Ray Tudor adds short-lived charm as Omar, Southern-fried beatnik.  There is a starkness to the photography that gives one the encroaching sense of doom.  And the editing was done by none other than Radley Metzger, the man who a decade later would don the nom de guerre Henry Paris and create the greatest hardcore porn movie of all time, THE OPENING OF MISTY BEETHOVEN.  (So we ain't exactly dealing with amateurs here, folks.)

My problem with this DVD is one of clarity.  Often the shots contain no actors or just parts of actors and their voices.  A little money should have been spent on better cropping the screen dimensions or at least providing letterboxes.  Also the monster is so ridiculously fake as to be hilarious.  It mars the overall impact of the flick.

But not too much.  This is still an underrated chiller deserving wider attention and not a bad way at all to spend a Saturday night.",1146960000,,1463,4.807228915662651

8073374,4,B000A2XC3A,"oh, man, just watched jack curtis' 1964 opus, the flesh eaters, a movie whose title forced george romero to alter the original title for night of the living dead. when i was like seven years-old, i stayed up late to watch this movie, sneaked into the teevee room, and huddled by the tube. i remember being drawn in by the colorful title. when the movie began, and the first victim starts to have her flesh eaten, i freaked, turned the teevee off, and ran to bed.

finally, 37 years later, i decided to get back on that horse.

what a b-movie delight the flesh eaters is! the plot is simple enuf: people get stuck on an island, run into a german marine biologist (he's a nazi? didn't see that coming!), and start finding completely denuded human and fish skeletons. it doesn't take them long to figure out that tiny organisms that look like scratches carved directly into the celluloid have an insatiable appetite for flesh.

lots of removing shirts and jumping around acrobatically ensues, and the leads really sell their respective parts. this flick is also notable for its' gore, something that was still in it's very early stages back in '64 when this movie was released. the flesh eating is creative and bloody, and jack curtis and company really mine the possibilities of how many different ways people can be flesh-eaten.

i really like the earnest and passionate byron sanders as grant, and beautiful and resourceful barbara wilken as jen; the two make perfect romantic leads, as they take turns removing their shirts to give to one another. nice. rita morley as drunken actress laura winters, the ginger of the group if you will, is a hoot. all she does is drink, act bi-polar, and say hilarious things. her problem, as described by beatnik omar is a ""sour liver: too much meat, sugar, alcohol, onions, and sex."" ""i can do without most of those, but how can i be expected to give-up onions?"" she asks omar with a sly grin. pure gold.

this movie is definitely awesome. well-shot, acted with energy, very creative, low-budget special effects (that terrified a once seven year-old hardened horror vet), i really like this movie. i wish byron and barbara had acted in more, cuz i could definitely stand more of them. a gentle envelope-pusher in the horror genre, this film should be seen by all.",1445385600,,2300,4.711442786069652
