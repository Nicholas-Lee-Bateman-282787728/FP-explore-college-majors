8556493,5,B00AQMWDYI,"I really enjoyed this terrific combo.  ""The Mad Executioners"" is a great story with a solid script, handsome cast, stunning sets and excellent cinematography.  Although it takes place in 1963, there is a certain Gothic flavor to the fog-shrouded settings and haunting score.  The movie plays very well and is easy to follow, its two concurrent storylines resolving themselves in a unique and cohesive manner.

""Fellowship of the Frog"" is not without its merits but seems much harder to follow.  I've tried several times and just barely have an idea what is going on.  Still the cast is very good and if the heavy doses of humor don't bother you, you'll enjoy the ambience.  Much lighter in tone than ""Mad Executioners"" but good enough for the bottom half of a double-bill.",1439856000,,772,4.847328244274809
8556494,5,B00AQMWDYI,"These Edgar Wallace Collections are some of the best of British whodunit I have found and this one is at the top of the list. Two very good Scotland Yard mysteries with great pictures and very good sound. Great plots with endings you never see coming. Many of these type British movies are less than good, but not the Edgar Wallace collection. If you like great mysteries check out the Edgard Wallace collection.",1421020800,,412,4.657534246575342
8556495,4,B00AQMWDYI,"After watching volume 2 of Retromedia's Edgar Wallace Collection, I had grave doubts about viewing another set of these German mysteries but fear not I ventured forward and was rewarded with a surprisingly entertaining double bill of murder and intrigue.  Both films have strong storylines, obviously due to Bryan Edgar Wallace's original material, and have been very well adapted to the screen and the dubbing into English from the original German is more than acceptable.
""The Mad Executioners"" successfully combines two storylines which gel for a very exciting and convincing conclusion.  Scotland Yard is baffled in its efforts to capture a bunch of hooded  vigilantes who are carrying out mock trials and summary hangings and even using historic hangman's rope from the Yard's museum!  Although I don't condone vigilantes in any form, you can't blame them here as their victims really deserve their comeuppance.  Running parallel to all this is a mad sex murderer who kills his young female victims and surgically removes their heads and when he is tracked down, we discover a lab  which Doctor Frankenstein himself, would surely be impressed by!  How these two heady stories run into each other is one of the many joys of this nifty little mystery.
""Fellowship of the Frog"" features a sinister gang of thieves and murderers headed by the mysterious ""Frog"", so mysterious that not even any of his tadpoles have any idea who he is.  His widespread network  threatens to take over old London town.  There's all sorts of red herrings and interesting sub characters, even a methodical Maigret type of police inspector.  There's even a couple of cabaret songs thrown in which were fortunately left with their German lyrics intact.  It is said that justice moves slowly but in this one, British justice moves at a rapid speed and our innocent  boy escapes the hangman barely in the nick of time and by an absolute humdinger of a surprise twist.  And as in all good crime films, the ""Frog"" meets his sticky end.
Despite their limited budgets and the occasional blip in the prints, this double bill of thrillers work well and I think you will get a lot of fun out of them.",1411776000,6,2169,4.890710382513661
8556496,4,B00AQMWDYI,"Nice pair of West German-made, English-dubbed Edgar Wallace penned mystery thrillers.  The first, The Mad Executioners, is about a band of mysterious hooded judges who pronounce sentence on kidnapped individuals, who escaped justice for their crimes, and execute them.  The cops are on the trail of these vigilantes but never seem to come close.  Story is based in London and ALL the night scenes seem to be choked in fog.  The second, and the better, The Fellowship of the Frog, is about a band of mysterious masked criminals terrorizing the British countryside.  The picture quality of the DVD is fine.  Highly recommended for fans of this particular genre.",1407110400,5,659,5.055555555555555
