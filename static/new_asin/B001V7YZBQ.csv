3819535,5,B001V7YZBQ,"I was on the fence about this DVD, but I am so glad that I bought it. The workout is fun and got my heart rate up and made me sweat. I am a high intermediate/low advanced exerciser. I was afraid it would be too easy, but it was not. The steps are basic, which is good for me because I am not well-coordinated.

As others commented, Violet offers modifications for lower intensity if you are more of a beginner. Violet Zaki is a great instructor and really makes you want to work hard and do your best.",1256256000,2,501,4.112244897959184
3819536,5,B001V7YZBQ,"This is my second Violet Zaki exercise DVD and once again - for me - she hits a home run.  It's challenging but also a lot of fun.  You will know you've worked out, but it's doable, she's encouraging and a fabulous teacher.  You can choose the segment you want based on how much time you have - 20 - 51 mins. etc.  She definitely - most definitely - knows her stuff and makes it fun.  You get toned but you also get the needed cardio - and the kick boxing moves in this one work you but are not too difficult to master.  Really love the DVD and actually recommend any of her DVD's to people who want to get fit and lose some weight!",1255737600,,632,3.9761904761904763
3819537,5,B001V7YZBQ,"Violet Zaki does an awesome job in Weight Loss Cardio Kick!  Cueing is perfect, the production of this seems flawless.  The DVD constists of:

5 minute warm up includes side jabs, front punches, hooks & upper cuts, lunge stretch, squats, front kicks & rear kicks,  chambers & round house kicks.

Power Sculpting (20 min.)
You will need two sets of weights; 3-5 lbs for the heavy weights, 1-2 lbs for the light weights. Violet progressively builds on the movements. She alternates sculpting and cardio.  Violet begins with sculpting; arm scoops w/ weights & shoulder presses, then adds squats. Cardio Blast with jacks, jump rope, shuffle squats and forward/back shuffles. Next, leg sculpting - lunges, squats, & kicks with jacks. CB with upper cuts and football run.  Arm sculpting - tricept work, hooks & uppercuts. CB - Front kicks, calf pumps.... You get the idea =)  There are two remaining sculpting/cardio sets.  Violet finishes with 5 minutes of pure cardio.

Drills & Combos (20 min.)
No hand weights for this!  Violet start out using jabs, hooks, uppercuts and builds from there. Next she works on kicks; front, back, & roundhouse. She adds some jacks upping the intensity. The rest of the cardio is comprised of different combos incorporating all the kick boxing moves.

6 minute Cool Down
I really enjoyed this cool down.  It's better than most I've seen, which was refreshing!  Violet stretches out the legs while incorporating some balance too. I enjoy her breathing techniques, which may come from her Karate background? She does the usual stretching for arms.  The music is nice and relaxing =)

Bonus Material includes a segment that explains proper form for the kickboxing moves, I highly recommend reviewing this. I learned my form for the hook was incorrect. There is also a 5 min. segment from her Weight Loss Cardio Scuplt DVD.

If you do this workout in its entirety, you will be extremely sweaty!!!! There are modifications for beginners, so I recommend this for all levels. This is great cardio work.  If you are an advanced exerciser, the sculpting is not near enough at an advanced level, but I highly recommend for cardio!  I love this DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!",1253145600,50,2177,4.931318681318682
3819538,5,B001V7YZBQ,"This is an excellent fitness dvd.  I own many kickboxing dvds and I really like this one.  Violet Zaki gives great instruction and cueing and she is very personable.  It has good production values and has some pre-mixed workouts.  It consists of 2 20 minute workouts:  a kickboxing cardio and a cardio sculpt.  You can do them together or separately.  I really like the option of doing a shorter workout.  Violet also has one person showing the beginner or low-impact options.  I liked this instructor so much that I am going to order her ""weight loss cardio sculpt"".",1251590400,17,567,4.704081632653061
3819619,5,B001V7YZBQ,I've done Jillian Michaels Kick Box DVD for several years but was hesitant about purchasing this because I'm 63. Based on reviewers who have exercised for years like myself I decided to try it. I'm able to keep up plus it offers an excellent workout.

3819646,3,B001V7YZBQ,"I think this is a good workout for beginners, or pre-intermediate. I am not in the best shape, nor the worst. I could run a slow 5K with some difficulty probably. Not a 7K without some pain. I have been doing some kick boxing courses for about 6months, maybe 1 or 2 times a week. I only work out about 2 times a week. I am 42 years old, I am about 30 pounds overweight. I have some knee problems. And even so, I felt this was a bit too slow, and a bit too boring, and not enough of a hard workout for me. There are too many breaks for me. I want a strong, hard, 20 minute workout, then I will rest for 5, and then another, that sort. But here, here you kind of stop and pause about every minute or couple of minutes. I was just bored. I have tried it twice, and tried to see if I could make it harder for myself, such as doing double-time on moves to her single timed moves, and I still found I am not getting enough of a workout. And there are so few actual kickboxing moves. Mostly it felt like cardio and weight training, and  really want to move when I workout, not stand there living weights.  I think for a beginner this could be a very good workout, or those that prefer wight and resistance training, then this would be really good for them too. Personally, I prefer Jillian Micheal's Kickboxing workout.",1440201600,,1312,4.12109375

3819653,5,B001V7YZBQ,"I've done the workouts on here twice now and I love this dvd. The only thing is she is a bit slow/unclear with her cues but after doing it a couple of times, you can catch on to it. I'm horrible with learning choreography so the moves aren't super complex and I certainly appreciate that:) If you put your all into it, you can easily burn between 700-900 calories. Of course other factors have to be considered such as your age, current weight etc. If you're looking for something super advanced, this probably isn't the dvd for you. But I have been working out for over 10 years consistently, sometimes twice a day plus I'm a runner and this dvd had me sweating profusely. It'll definitely go into my kickboxing rotation",1432166400,,721,4.511450381679389

Loved the ""Warm Up + Exercise + Cool Down 2 Combos.

pros
-there is a person doing modifications if you need it.

-cons

3819707,3,B001V7YZBQ,"I would have to agree with most--this video is more suited for people with a beginner level of fitness not moderate like advertised.  While I would consider myself to be a person with a moderate-fitness level (I do the middle workouts on just about every Jillian Michael's workout), this video was too easy. As such, I found it rather boring and hard to keep focused.  Someone with a higher fitness level may enjoy this on a recovery day but I don't know if I would purchase a video just for that.

But anyway to review the actual video (why I gave it 3 stars): The instructor only performs the harder moves long enough to begin to feel the 'burn' and quickly moves to others which does not allow you to see results very fast.  However, she over-performs some of the easier moves to the point where I feel you will began to get bored.  There are quite a few 'breathing' breaks where she has you do toe touches and such to recover your breathe but then starts the next set with a low-heart-rate strength training exercise making the 'breathing breaks' not really necessary. There are quite a few strength training moves spliced inside of kickboxing moves which made the video seem choppy.  However, I do agree the video quality is well-done and the instructor is friendly and supportive which would work well for someone that needs more instruction.

In summary, if you are a beginner, this video will likely provide you with the practice and the time you need to move up in fitness level. However, I would assume you would move on from this video quickly.  if your fitness level is higher than beginner, I would skip it.",1390435200,4,1620,4.581314878892734

I feel this is going to help me get to my desired goal.",1384300800,,296,3.625
3819712,4,B001V7YZBQ,"I found this DVD when I went in search of an alternative for my kickboxing DVD (I believe Lori Dean HITS is no longer available). I must say that I like the workout and the intensity of the work out depends on your level of fitness although I think that even moderate to advanced folks looking for a good quick workout can easily modify these exercises to increase their level of difficulty.

I won't describe the details of the specific segments because other reviewers have done so already (excellent review details by the way) but I will describe why I gave it four stars instead of five: The transitions between some, not all, of the exercises, while they are not difficult they can cause some strain especially if you're just starting out or a beginner or have problems with knees and ankles. Some of the transitions are fast and one out of all the combinations was a little confusing even for me. This was in the second 20 minute workout of the DVD which is all cardio. I usually select ""Play all"" which leads me to one slight negative of the dvd menu. When you select ""play all"" it plays the short introduction to the segment. I don't mind it that much because I use this as a recovery period or a quick minute to hydrate.

One of the many strengths of the dvd is that it combines cardio with muscle conditioning (you need 3-5 pound weights). Zaki takes you through a warm up and then you hit cardio and switch to muscle conditioning and then cardio and so on. If you've ever done a work out where you switch between a brisk walk and gentle jog this is very similar in that respect. During one of the cardio routines, at least for me, I've had to modify the transition even further. Punching and turning to the sides, for some reason, caused a catch on my ankle, even though I know that in boxing and kickboxing (and I do practice both), one must ""be on your toes"" literally. Be light on your toes. When you're turning and moving and punching, you must be ever aware of what you're feet are doing, don't glue them down to the floor. I know this and for some reason, my ankle still gave me a jolt.

Zaki is average about warning you on good technique when it comes to certain exercises but I didn't find her instruction that detailed in terms of safety with other moves and transitions. It helps if you have a kickboxing or boxing knowledge or have learned techniques from other kickboxing dvds so that you work out safely. I believe this DVD assumes that you already have this knowledge. If you're unsure about the safety of any moves, i definitely recommend that you watch the video several times before you attempt any of the moves.

As I said before most of the combinations are simple and easy and they make sense. with one or two exceptions, the moves from one exercise is either too fast or two awkward. Another strength of the video is that Zaki works out along side two other athletes, one working at the same level as Zaki and the other a modified version. It helps if you're starting out.

Overall I enjoyed this DVD. You get two 20 minute workouts and so for those days you want to challenge yourself you play both segments and you get a 50 minute workout, which includes the warm up and the cool down. Of course you can modify up or down (weights or not weights) to adjust the work out to your level of fitness.",1378166400,,3330,4.39935064935065
3819713,3,B001V7YZBQ,"This video is pretty good. I wish there was an abs portion, but there is not. The first day I just did the first part with the weights and stopped before the 20 minute all cardio section. I saved this for the next day, but after I finished that part, I felt like I hadn't worked out enough so I went back and did the first part again.",1376784000,,334,3.926470588235294

Weight Loss Cardio Kick was the perfect fit for me.  The workout targets your whole body; I've been amazed at how quickly I started seeing results.  Within a couple of weeks I started seeing definition in my arms that has never existed in my 38 years and I'm even seeing impact on my upper thighs / lower hips which have always been my nemesis.

I like how the first segment builds you up to the full cardio of the second segment by doing the short cardio blasts in between the toning portions.  Don't let the first cardio blast deter you, it is by far the most challenging.

By working with this video 2-4 times a week in combination with the portion control encouraged by the LoseIt app, I've gone from a size 10 to a size 4 (started LoseIt 10 months ago).

I'm more into cardio than strength, so - personally - I'd recommend the combos & drills 20m workout if you're planning on just doing 20m at a time. That section will have you drenched in sweat by the finish! The combos on both sections can be hard to get the first time around just because Violet moves pretty quick from move to move, but DON'T GIVE UP! try it a few times and you'll realize that you actually start remembering the moves.

As far as specific results - the first things to change were my thighs and ""back fat"". I haven't been using 1lb weights in the power sculpt section so that would explain why I haven't seen any real changes in my arms.",1344988800,,851,4.285714285714286
3819755,5,B001V7YZBQ,"As someone who is new to working out I found this to be an excellent video.

The workouts are broken up into 2 20 minute sessions (or 2 31 minutes which include warm up and cool down).

For Beginners:

I found the moves easy to pick up, taking me only about 3 times to start really getting the routines down.

She divides the 20 minute workout into several blocks.  After each one she slows you down to a march and takes you through some breathing.  This really helped me out!  It gave me a chance to catch my breath.  I've done workouts before that never let up and I find myself just shutting down before i could finish.  That is not the case here!

I also found her to be very motivating and upbeat.  Every time she says: ""You're not going to quit on me now, Of Course You're Not!"" I always keep pushing.  She constantly talks to you, and everything she says still feels just as motivating on workout 20 as it did on number 1.

The time really goes by fast.  Even when I first started and I didn't think I could get through a whole workout (oh no!).  Before you know it you're done.

Since I still consider myself a beginner I can't really say what someone more advanced would be looking for in a workout.  I feel that intermediate level people might still find this fun.  I do think that people more advanced may not get the challenge out this workout that they would probably want.

All in all, I highly recommend this.",1344556800,,1424,4.265917602996255

The video is 2 20 minute workouts but the way it is set up, you can do it in sequence or in pieces. I really like her. She has two other girls in the video, one is working harder and the other is doing a lower impact version. This is a great way to continue the workout and not feel like you are failing at it.

Besides having a dismal background, the video seemed to be filmed through some kind of fish-eye lens that distorted everything that was going on. I've never seen any professional video take this approach, and it absolutely doesn't work. I suppose if you belong to that set that likes MTV so much you don't care about getting a real workout, you might be impressed by the fact that the instructor seems to be small and her foot gigantic when it kicks straight at you, or you might enjoy the blurriness of the action. But if you're serious about getting a workout and prefer to skip dizzying effects that detract from what's going on, I'd pass on this video. Go for 10 Minute Solution: Knockout Body instead.

3819764,4,B001V7YZBQ,"I love 30 Minutes to Fitness: Kickboxing with Kelly Coffey-Meyer, and I've been looking for another kickboxing DVD. I'm picky about kickboxing since I need something challenging, but not too hard. I also don't want anything too easy where all I'm doing is punching without breaking a sweat. I'm so glad I tried this workout DVD; it did make me sweat. The moves are easy to follow (sometimes too easy), but Violet Zaki (the instructor) doesn't let you stop, which is where the cardio comes in. You can follow along quickly; I didn't have to spend time trying to master the moves. You don't do each exercise for too long so if one exercise is hard, she'll quickly move onto a new one.

The video breaks down into 2 parts: Power Sculpt (where you'll use weights), and Drills and Combos (all kickboxing).

The Power Sculpt incorporates both weights with kickboxing, and you'll really feel the burn. Drills and Combos focuses on punching and kicks and putting them together. There's a couple repeating moves in both 20 minute workouts, which is the only tiny downside to this video. I would have liked to have seen completely different moves in each video instead of a couple repeats, although that's really not a big deal.

I'd recommend this kickboxing workout. She doesn't really go over form, but there is a girl who modifies the routines. This is a pretty good beginner video too; nothing is too hard, but you get a really good workout.

It's a good workout, but I would have liked to have seen a tiny more intensity in the workouts. Other than that, it's pretty good.",1326585600,,1568,4.670289855072464
3819765,3,B001V7YZBQ,"First thing, if you want a solid, no nonsense kickboxing workout, get 10 Minute Solution Kickbox Bootcamp. Weight Loss Cardio Kick is appealing, however, for its sheer strangeness. The set is like a workout prison, complete with catwalks above the class for that ""mess up and a guard will shoot you"" feel. Violet Zaki has starved herself, and shaped her hair into such a sharp mess, she resembles some sort of spiny ocean dwelling crustacean. The lovely ladies who accompany her are of a healthy size, but I think were chosen to accentuate Zaki's boniness. I'm surprised she didn't point behind her and say, ""Here's my chunk crew!"" The first segment is a random collection of weight training, cardio moves, and boxing in no particular order, for no particular length of time. It is utterly without choreography, but does get the heart going. Zaki speaks to the camera as if she were talking to a petulant child. ""You don't want to give up now, do you? Your body is telling you to stop, don't listen!"" Nope, don't feel like I have to stop, but thanks for the lack of encouragement.
  The second segment continues the wacky with a kind of kickboxing line dance that doesn't seem to repeat or build. Either this woman is the Martha Graham of fitness instruction, or she has no short-term memory. It is a workout, not a terrible one, but could use more structure, and have more to do with kickboxing.

To put it in perspective, I was not challenged by the majority of Jillian Michaels' ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism""; Bob Harper's ""Bob Rev: Cardio Conditioning,"" in comparison, kicked my butt, though I was able to complete it. I'd probably actually give this workout a 3.5 stars because, though it was pretty easy for me, I did really like the instructor. The cardio portion kicked it up some, but the sculpting was at a very beginner level in my opinion. I do a lot of Firm dvds, and their strength training moves are typically much more challenging than those on this dvd. I'll use this as a lighter day workout because I do like Violet. Really can't stand the permanent fake smiles on the exercisers, though I did appreciate seeing women who weren't stick-thin Barbie dolls. I don't know why so many workout dvds think they have to have the exercisers smiling the whole time while acting as though they're working hard. When I'm working hard, I'm not smiling constantly. In comparison to Tae Bo, I prefer Billy Blanks' energy, but Violet doesn't drone on about herself and her accomplishments, so I prefer this dvd to any of the Tae Bo ones that I've done.

This was a better workout than the Cardio Sculpt DVD but, still, there were too many points where I was not working at all either due to recovery periods or explanations.

Also, for some reason, the moves just did not seem to flow well for me --- the low point being the kick-jack segment.  I usually don't have trouble picking up routines on the first round but I was seriously concentrating and playing catch up to follow the moves on that one.

I have always liked this instructor since I started working out with DVDs.  That said, her commentary went over that fine line from encouraging to overkill.  I would have preferred more silence to catch phrases that were repeated one time too often.

For those who want to ease themselves into a workout, Violet has two back-ups working out behind her, one of whom does the same workout, just not as high-impact. I think that's really great that that option is included.

It seems Amazon has opened their VOD to any crappy video producer that is willing to be on here, with no mind for if it's a quality product or not, and they DO NOT give refunds or credits, so stay away from this stinker!

3819777,4,B001V7YZBQ,"I'll start off by saying that I purchased this dvd after reading the other reviews.  I'd consider myself at an intermediate level fitness level - I work out about 2-3 times a week.  This past year, I've done a combination of Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred (usually level 1 or 2), and the EA Sports Active on the Wii.  One of the big reasons I picked this is because I work out in the morning, and have a hard time getting up early enough to do a longer workout (especially after daylight savings changes in the spring!).  So, I loved the idea that you can pick and choose the length of the workout.

I started with the tutorial (found in bonus features) so I would understand what she meant by the various moves, since I haven't done any kickboxing or martial arts (tho my son does taekwondoe, so I know some of those moves).  Then I did the Power Sculpt with both warmup and cool down (this was during winter break, so no deadline).  I kept thinking it would get harder, so I didn't do the optional weights with the boxing sections.  I didn't break a sweat, but did get a mild workout.  Then, 2 days later, I tried the Cardio Kick, with warm up and cool down (this was also winter break).  I did break a sweat, and I suspect that after I get more used to the moves, will get more out of it, since there is a coordination factor that is more similar to aerobics rather than calisthenics a la Jillian.

Now that winter break is over, I tried the Power Sculpt without the warmup, and did ok (did a Jillian-type stretch at the end).  I used my 3 lb weights for both sections - I should probably grab my 5 lb weights for the heavier sections.

Anyhow, the trainer style is a little laid back compared to Jillian, and I'm not entirely sure how much I like it, but it is a nice change of pace.  Sometime when I have more time, I will try doing the entire 51 minutes and see how that goes, but I probably will end up getting something more challenging, too.",1294185600,,1950,4.235135135135135
3819778,5,B001V7YZBQ,"This is a terrific kickboxing DVD.  There is no tutorial on the ring moves provided, but there is an assistant with Violet Zaki doing a modified version of the workout for beginners.

The workouts are only 20 minutes which is great for me; I'm a full-time mom so I don't have time for long workouts.  I love the incorporated kick-boxing moves, it really changes up your workout and makes it fun.  This is the first video that I've exercised with and haven't looked at the clock every few minutes to see when I would finally be done, it's great!",1291680000,6,467,4.333333333333333

3819781,5,B001V7YZBQ,"This workout was surprisingly challenging but very manageable.  The trainer is very pleasant to listen to and not annoying like many trainers on their videos.  The workout is also very effective and challenging but not one of those that you find you can't do half of it because it is too complex.  You can keep up but you do work hard doing it.  Some segments have a lot of jumping in them and that can be a problem for some.  Overall, I would follow this trainer to other videos anytime.",1287100800,,488,4.377777777777778

But Violet sure does not do that! She is ready to help you achieve your goal, by getting you motivated to have a great workout! It's fun to be able to kick mid air, and get some of a hard days aggression out. One of my favorite parts was the cool down at the end. It completely relaxed you and your muscles, so I know I won't be as sore tomorrow. And the other great thing about this video is that once I have gotten used to doing one of the 20 minute workouts, I can eventually do both. Weight Loss Cardio Kick is completely recommended! During the workout she knows when the tough parts come along and really pushes you to go the extent you need to go. I will post some of my body results after I try this for about a month.

3819784,2,B001V7YZBQ,The dvd isn't that bad but I find that it's defintiely not for beginners. She goes way too fast and doesn't show proper technique on form or stance or anything like that. I guess if you already know about cardio kick it's good. But I just started out with this and I am not that pleased.,1281312000,,287,4.142857142857143
3819785,4,B001V7YZBQ,"I'm was searching for a quick workout and found it in this fun cardio kickboxing workout. Violet keeps it interesting by switching it up alot.

I really like that when you turn on the DVD you don't have to go through a bunch of ads and junk , the menu pops up quickly so you can begin right away.",1278633600,2,397,4.2368421052631575
3819786,2,B001V7YZBQ,"First off, this will take more room than the average person has. Secondly, the set was dark, and the camera angles were horrible. This made it difficult to see what you were supposed to do (proper form and movement). I have went to kickboxing classes in the past, and this DVD just does not do kickboxing as a cardio workout justice. I had to go running afterward just to get my workout, and I will not be adding it as part of my workouts anymore. If I can't get a good workout the first time I use a workout DVD, it's not worth my time. There are too many DVD's out there that will give me a good workout the first time.

I would highly recommend this to anyone!!",1276041600,,307,4.648148148148148
3819788,5,B001V7YZBQ,"I purchased this workout based off of the great reviews it received and also because I was familiar with Violet Zaki from her Crunch: Cardio Sculpt dvd, which has always been one of my favorites.  The way it started, I mistakenly thought that this was going to be a another pretty easy workout -- wow, was I wrong.  This was really really challenging!  By the end of the cardio segment, I was out of breath and really glad that it was over! (which is a good thing!)  I feel like a got an incredible cardio workout in the 51 minutes that it took to complete.  I am in great shape (I run, I bike and I swim) and many times, the workouts that I order are just too easy and I don't feel that I have gotten a good enough workout.  That is not the case with this video. Violet provides really great encouragement and instruction in a non-threatening way -- some instructors are just too over the top and really annoying.  She really makes you sweat but it's not overly fast-paced at all.  All of a sudden, you just realize your body is working really hard!  You will find yourself asking:  Hey, how did that happen?  This looked easy?!  You will want to do this workout again and again.  I would highly recommend purchasing.  I can't wait to do it again!  Also, another plus is the cooking light recipes that are included with the dvd -- that is really a nice extra.",1275868800,4,1360,4.320158102766799
3819789,5,B001V7YZBQ,"I decided to purchase this dvd for variety among my dance-conditioning selections, and I'm glad I did. The 20-minute segments (the first using light hand-weights and kickboxing moves, the second with pure cardio kick-boxing) fit in well to add a bit of extra cardio to my dance conditioning workouts. Violet is also very mature, engaging, and personable, without being overly aggressive at all in her coaching demeanor (given that this is a kickboxing workout, not a dance workout). She does the entire workout with her backup exercisers, and keeps things moving with well-timed cueing and encouragement. It was actually quite fun for me to do, and gives one an invigorating feeling of ""kicking the cr*p"" out of one's problems and stresses. I might try doing the entire work on its own, but it really fits in quite well being tacked on to the end of a long calisthenics workout that isn't heavy on cardio, yielding a well-rounded overall workout. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a fairly safe, effective cardio routine that's fun and non-intimidating.",1275091200,2,1063,5.011299435028248

What I love about the DVD is that Violet is very encouraging with out being sappy or barking at you.  Unlike some other instructors she does each segment right along with you and reminds you to breathe, keep correct form, and to see the workout through to the end.  She also instructs you to say each move as you do it...jab, hook, right kick, etc. which definetely helps those who are less than coordinated.  I've had to keep myself from doing this DVD everyday because I really do enjoy it.  There are two other women working out, one for low impact/beginners and the other who keeps up with Violet doing higher impact/advanced.  Either way you will be sweating within minutes!  I think this is a great workout no matter what your fitness level and I highly recommend it.",1273622400,3,932,4.4733727810650885

I had never heard of Violet Zaki, so I was a little hesitant, but her credentials looked outstanding. This is such a great workout. I like how I can choose to either do 1 20min workout or both depending on my day. Either way it certainly gets your heart pumping, and makes me feel stronger each time I do it! Violet has such a great disposition about her - a great trainer and motivator. This dvd certainly won't collect any dust in my home!",1271721600,22,594,4.265486725663717

It makes you feel engaged.  She has excellent cueing before every move, and that helps a lot.  The time allocated for the video is just right, and the coreography is simple enough to make you work.  I love this video, will be looking for others from Violet.",1271289600,,422,4.160493827160494
3819795,5,B001V7YZBQ,"As I said in the title, both workouts on this DVD are absolutely fabulous!  I started doing just the cardio one (all kickboxing), and boy did it make me sweat.  After doing that one several times, I switched to the Power Sculpt workout (I was intimidated to try it at first), and that made me sweat just as much (and I found I had nothing to be afraid of!).  Of the two, I really, really, REALLY like the kickboxing segment.  It's almost like I can feel the pounds melting away as I'm doing it.

Pros:  What I really love about these workouts is how many calories I burn. Also, just about the time I'm starting to lose my breath, Violet stops and gives you a minute to breathe.  That's what makes these workouts so doable.  I also like how Violet works you up into the full moves, i.e., jab, then cross, then jab and cross, then hook, then upper-cut, then hook and upper-cut, etc., then you put them ALL together.

Also, the warm-up and cool-down with these workouts is AWESOME.  Much better than what Jillian Michaels gives you (in my opinion).  They are by far the longest of all the workout DVDs I've tried (I think another reviewer has mentioned that as well).  I like that.  I really feel stretched and relaxed after completing one of these workouts and the subsequent cool-down.

Cons:  I do wish these workouts were a little longer.  Due to their short length I've gotten in the habit of doing an interval training workout, followed by one of these workouts.  But, this may be a ""pro"" for someone who's looking for a shorter workout due to time constraints.

This is a GREAT DVD and I am now a Violet Zaki fan.  I'm interested in trying the Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt DVD based on how much I like this one.",1269561600,4,1712,4.412140575079873
3819796,5,B001V7YZBQ,"Have to agree on the reviews.  I viewed this on my computer before I actually attempted it and my feeling was that it was a middle of the road, medium workout, not what I was looking for.  I've been working out for 31 years and went through the decade of high impact aerobics and the whole schpill, so am used to monster workouts, high heart rates and mega burns.  Have done the Billy Blanks Amped and Full Throttle, and they're okay, but put my polar watch on just for comparisons on calorie burns, and this DVD went an extra 50 calories further than the TaeBo routines.  I was astonished and knew halfway into this DVD that I was fixing to get my butt whipped, but for someone like me, I absolutely loved it and have been doing it six mornings a week for the last two weeks and have lost a couple of pounds through just this routine.  Diet is the same, this took the weight off.  I vary always with treadmills, ellipticals, other workout routines, and find myself more and more wanting to come back to this workout.  She's very soothing and inspirational, no screaming, yelling or boot camp rhetoric.  A definite must-have for anyone at any level.",1269475200,31,1149,4.464114832535885

But I just won't do them every day-- they take a major commitment for me after a long day of work. This workout makes me sweat, but it's relatively easy if you've done any weights and cardio before. I don't really believe I'll ""get results"" like the others, but at this point, I want to enjoy doing a daily workout, and this is enjoyable and doable. So I'll mix it up with a few of the more difficult DVDs, but I'm really glad is have this one! Violet is great, too! love that aussie accent!",1269302400,2,581,4.105263157894737

I really like instructors who do the actual moves and not move around pointing out what the others are doing. I also appreciate having someone complete the moves in a beginner fashion and with lighter weights. It is not as intimidating and I feel I can eventually work my way up to the advanced steps....eventually:-) A lot of the moves remind me of Turbo Jam, which I also love.

However, if you are a beginner or not totally coordinated you may end up finding yourself spending more time trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing rather than sweating.

To me  a lot of the strength training was a waste - not enough repetitions to really get any burning feeling.

The cardio is decent  a few times I felt a bit winded and I would definitely say that this is a fun work out - fast paced and the instructor is upbeat and pleasing to listen to.

I was sweating by the end of it but wasn't as thrilled with the workout as I was hoping.",1267660800,2,678,4.307086614173229

3819802,5,B001V7YZBQ,"Love, love, love this dvd.  I've created quiet a fitness dvd collection and this is one of my favorites.  It is so much fun to do.  There are 2 workouts - cardio/strength and cardio - on the dvd to choose from.  I usually do both along with the warm up and cool down to give me well-rounded workout session.  I used to think that the only cardio workout available on dvd was step aerobics, which was disappointing because I'm not at all coordinated.  The cardio kickboxing drills presented on this dvd are fun and not overly complicated.  They make you sweat and raise you heart level.  At the end of the dvd my muscles burn and I feel energized.  And, I've burned calories!

Violet Zaki is fantastic.  She cues great and is very encouraging.  She wants you to do your best, but she certainly doesn't want to push you beyond your limits.",1266624000,2,837,4.434210526315789
3819803,5,B001V7YZBQ,"I was a beginner to kickbox cardio when I purchased this so it was slightly tricky getting the movements down in the first go-around.
After that, it was pretty fun.
The instructor moves at a pretty good pace so you're not bored. Its also challenging enough with both segments (all cardio and cardio/strength).
The great thing is that you don't need a lot of space or equiptment, just a few sets of light handweight",1266364800,2,414,4.608108108108108
3819804,5,B001V7YZBQ,"I just did this workout for the first time today.  I really enjoyed it!  I'm an intermediate exerciser and found it to be a good workout that made me sweat.  I did the entire thing, but you can break it down into different combinations, depending on how much time you have that day (20-50 minutes).  Unlike most videos, this has a good warm up and cool down.  It has a combination of kickboxing, bootcamp-type drills, and weights.  The majority of moves are kickboxing.  You do moves that work upper body, lower body, or both at same time.  I felt Violet Zacki did an okay, but not great job cueing.  I think because I have done kickboxing before I was able to catch on quickly.  I have also tried Violet Zaki's ""The Trainer's Edge with Violet Zaki: Killer Kicks"" and like this video much better.  I felt ""Killer Kicks"" was too easy.  I highly recommend ""Weight Loss Cardio Kick.""",1265760000,2,880,4.5
3819815,4,B001V7YZBQ,This is a good work out for someone with limited time.  There are two sessions on the DVD which last a little more that 30 mins if you do the cool down.  You can make it easier or harder for yourself depending on your mood and fitness level.  The instructor is not annoyingly perky.  Good way to get going in the morning,1264896000,2,320,4.112903225806452
3819816,5,B001V7YZBQ,"Before this DVD, I had never tried kick-boxing, but now I want more!  This is a great introduction to the sport -- a heart-pumping workout that makes you feel strong and fit.  The instructor starts each combination with some basic steps, repeating them until you get a feel for it, and then adds on.  It's not ""dancy"", but very rhythmic, making it easy to follow, but believe me, you still have to think if you want to keep up!  Just say the words to yourself after she says them, and your body will follow (e.g. ""Jab! - Cross!"")

The warm-up is fast paced and will get you breathing faster right away.  The cool down (about 6 mins.) is very thorough, and not rushed or skimpy like in many other workouts.  Her cueing is good, and she offers some good motivational encouragement without being ""cutesy"" at all, but what I really like is that there is an additional exerciser on the screen doing all the same moves in a low-impact way, which is easier on the joints and can be a lower instensity if you are just starting out.  (This is important to beginning exercisers, so you don't get discouraged and give up.) A nice feature is that you can choose which sections of the dvd you want to do each day, such as warm-ups, followed by the cardio segment, and then straight to cool-down, or skip the cardio and do just the sculpt, etc.

If I could improve this DVD, I would ask for an additional section of cardio.  The existing one is great, but it's only 18 minutes, and I usually like to do cardio a little longer than that.  I end up rewinding a bit and repeating a portion of it, so it would be nice to have perhaps another 10-minute segment that you could combine with the first or do on its own if you are limited on time.  Otherwise, this is a great DVD and I'm now looking for more just like it.",1264464000,6,1799,4.3056379821958455

As with any, there is person to follow for beginners and for the more advanced.  This one has a lot of kicks and lunges and it takes more coordination than the others, but while it definitely makes you sweat, it doesn't work one area to the point of collapse.

 to Violet's teaching method. I am going to order more of her DVD's. I have tried many other trainer's video's and truly enjoy Violet's

3819824,4,B001V7YZBQ,"NOTE: I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online.

This DVD is led by Violet Zaki, who holds a black belt in karate.  She works out with two background exercises, one of whom shows lower impact modifications for some of the moves.  The cover of this DVD states that it provides ""2 20-Minute Fat-Blasting Workouts"" although there are actually several different options for customizing your workout experience.  The Main Menu includes an Introduction, Workout Options (described below), Bonus Features (including kickboxing tutorial for those unfamiliar with the punches and kicks used), Also from Acacia, and Credits.  If you select Workout Options, you are taken to a submenu screen which provides the various workout choices.  First, there is a ""Play All"" option (51m), allowing you to play both 20-minute workouts back-to-back along with the separate Warm-Up (5m) and Cool-Down (6m) chapters.  Next, you can select each of the two workouts, Power Sculpt (20m) and Drills & Combos (20m), individually, with the option of playing them either with or without Zaki's brief introductions (<2m).  As mentioned above, the Warm-Up and Cool-Down are chaptered separately, so these can be selected from the submenu screen as well.

In the Warm-Up, Zaki basically just introduces the various punches and kicks used throughout the workout one by one.  The standard punches include jab, cross, hook, and uppercut, while there are three basic kicks, front, back, and roundhouse.  If you have chosen the Play All option, the Power Sculpt workout comes first.  The general pattern for the Power Sculpt workout is that Zaki begins with a ""heavy"" weights exercise, usually a dynamic movement that keeps the heart rate up.  She follows this by a series of either punches or kicking movements using lighter weights.  Finally, there is a ""cardio blast"" segment--for example, one combination included jumping jacks, jump rope, side-to-side shuffles, and front-to-back shuffles.  This sequence of heavy weights--light weights--cardio blast is repeated several times throughout the Power Sculpt session, which ends with a ""pure cardio"" segment.

The Drills & Combos portion is all cardio; Zaki instructs simple punch-kick sequences here.  She begins with an all-punch combination:  jab-cross-hook-upper-double jab-cross-shuffle.  Next, she moves on to an all-kick routine, first beginning with a basic front kick-back kick, but then upping both the difficulty and the complexity level by adding in jumping jacks, a side squat, and a roundhouse kick facing the side.  From this point on, Zaki blends the punches and kicks to form mixed combinations, but for the most part, she keeps the choreography relatively straightforward.  Some of the moves are even a bit fun and different, such as a side-to-side punch (which actually appears in both workouts) and a double block with a squat.  The Cool-Down features Asian-inspired music as Zaki leads you through stretches for all of the major muscle groups that were worked, including the quads, hamstrings, and shoulders.  She concludes the Cool-Down with a move borrowed from yoga, side angle pose, for a complete full body stretch.

These workouts are appropriate for beginning to intermediate exercisers:  beginners can take it easy by following the modifier and and sticking with only one 20-minute workout to start, whereas intermediate exercises can up the challenge by performing the entire 51-minute routine, using heavier dumbbells, and even adding weighted gloves for the cardio segment.  This is a solid workout with a good amount of versatility, and I would definitely recommend it.",1257638400,66,3655,5.368421052631579
