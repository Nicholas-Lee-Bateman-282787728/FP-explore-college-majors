7839634,5,6303127134,"I remember this documentary from 1980.  In fact, I never forgot it.  I was delighted to rediscover it and to discover that my memories were exact: the bureaucratic ticket seller, the children on the tracks playing their marracas and singing, the first-class compartment inhabited by four other passengers, the subsequent missed order of omelette, the train engineer nearing retirement and terming it ""natural"", and the arrival at Kerala and the beauties discovered.
Of course, the tape was faded - it's fifty years old!
I'm naturally indolent and hesitate to review purchases, but I owe an enormous debt to Brian Thompson (""The Bill"", etc.) and I had to tell the world how great this program was.",1366848000,,696,5.043478260869565
