8596465,4,B00DQUQ5FK,"This is quite a rare film, an early talkie feature which parodies the switchover from silent film to sound film production. It isn't an hilarious comedy, but is full of tongue-in-cheek humor and some funny lines from a variety of contrasting characters. It is the story of a nearly-bankrupt movie producer who is putting all the money he has in one dubious film production, which includes romance, drama, plus singing and dancing. This spoof on Hollywood filmmaking explores the different technical problems with early sound film production.

The DVD also includes a very early and bizarre sound cartoon short, which is pretty funny. I'm glad that I have this DVD of these rare films. The studio where this was made was destroyed by a fire only one day after the film was released. It is good that this obscure film has survived.",1518912000,2,829,4.838028169014085
