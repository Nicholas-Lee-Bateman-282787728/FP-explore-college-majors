7872146,5,6304470428,"I usually prefer the more serious themes of Tenchi, but these episodes were so terrfically funny that I couldn't help but give it five stars.
The first episode of the tape, ""No Need for a Rebellion!"" sets the series along its main plot and takes a sharp direction away from the OAV. There's a couple really great interactions between Ayeka, Ryoko, and Tenchi that become important near the closing of the series, and then the action begins. Ayeka and Sasami are convicted of treason when the legendary warrior Yosho returns to the throne of Jurai (if you've seen the OAV, you can probably guess a little bit of what's going on already). Ryoko is captured by the Jurai military as well, and Tenchi must go off to save the girls. The highlight of this episode, besides the foreshadowing of who Katsuhito really is, is a major fight scene between the Jurai military and Yosho and Tenchi.
The second episode is ""No Need for an Escape!"" and features the one time in the series where Mihoshi actually proves herself useful. Kione and Mihoshi return to Galaxy Police headquarters to find out what exactly is going on, and end up turned against the Galaxy Police and on the run. This episode gives a nice summary of how the Jurai government works in this series and how circumstances have gotten so far out of control for the heroes.
The third and last episode on the tape, ""No Need for Hiding!"" is by far the funnies episode on the tape. Tenchi and the girls set up a ripoff bar to make some money in space. The greatest features of this episode are seeing Azaka and Kamidake disguised as bouncers outside the bar, the karaoke party that the girls have (Ryoko, Ayeka, and Washu all get some great songs that have me rolling on the floor), and Katsuhito's mad drink mixing action (that man can do anything). Nagi is also reintroduced in this episode. All in all, it's mainly a sitcom-style episode, but the jokes are so wonderfully presented and delivered that there's no way anyone can watch it and keep a straight face.
This tape serves as a terrific change of pace from the adventures on Earth (as much as I loved the carnival episode, resident officers, and whatnot, it started to drag a bit). It also goes a long way to remind me exactly why I consider Tenchi Universe the best series on television.",983491200,5,2296,4.588807785888078
