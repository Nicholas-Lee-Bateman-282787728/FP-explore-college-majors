It's very family oriented, and entertaining as well. I've even found myself watching the program, when I should be keeping my home clean. I would recommend all the Pound Puppy DVDs to be a part of your family's collection. GT-Illinois",1379808000,,380,4.291666666666667
8566151,5,B00BCMT42U,"I'm surprised I never knew there was  Pound Puppies show until I received Mission: Adoption to review. It's really a quality, funny show with quirky characters that pull on your hear strings and humor that adults can appreciate.

I grew up playing with Pound Puppies so I was really interested to see how they would transfer to characters that are animated. I have to say it was not at all what I expected. I had a more sweet, cuddly image in mind. These Pound Puppies are a bit rough around the edges and more gruff than I expected.

Once I watched an episode though, I got it. They live in a pound! They have to be a little bit tough and spunky to take care of themselves. Once I got over the initial adjustment of what I visualized, I really enjoyed the show. There is a wide variety of personalities and the voices match the faces perfectly.

I like sharing these types of shows with my kids because watching something I grew up on somehow bridges the generational gap a bit and makes me nostalgic for my own childhood. My daughter is an animal lover just like I was so she especially enjoyed this show.

Pound Puppies - Mission: Adoption is witty and clever that kids of all ages can enjoy.",1369440000,3,1195,4.389140271493213
8566152,5,B00BCMT42U,"This new version of Pound Puppies (from The Hub Network and Hasbro Studios) is a great show and it is extremely underrated. The show has sharp humor, fun characters, a terrific voice cast, and sweet, touching story-lines.

The series stars the voices of Eric McCormack, Yvette Nicole Brown, Michael Rapaport, John DiMaggio, Alanna Ubach, Ren Auberjonois, and M. Emmet Walsh.

The episodes on this disc are:

Episode 7: King of the Heap
Episode 13: Taboo
Episode 18: Snow Problem
Episode 1 (season 2): Zipper the Zoomit Dog
Episode 5 (season 2): There's Something About Camelia

(You will notice that episode 7, ""King of the Heap"", has very rough, rigid animation compared to the rest of the episodes on the disc. After the airing of episode 7, the animation studio changed, and the series now has clean, fluid animation)

If you are a fan of this show, then you will definitely want to purchase this DVD.",1361750400,2,904,4.806451612903226
