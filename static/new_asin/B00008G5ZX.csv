7982460,1,B00008G5ZX,"Don't buy this if you are looking for a dramatic film with the same title (1944). Thought the IMDB put the link to this product, it is simply wrong. This consists of WWII newsreel clips without any reference to the citation. The dramatic film is now viewable on youtube, which is provided by Paramount Vault.",1463788800,,308,4.618181818181818

7982462,3,B00008G5ZX,My MOM is a Rosie the Riveter. It was informative but I thought it would be more detailed as to the life of a ROSIE. She loved it and we will keep it as a keepsake for the future.,1389484800,,179,3.6153846153846154
7982463,1,B00008G5ZX,"Its completely different from Rosie the Riveter that I've seen on VHS.  I was more interested in the documentary that covers quite extensively women's entry in factory jobs during WW2 also including participation by women of color.  The ""String of Pearls"" segment is a very superficial coverage of the jobs women did in the factories.",1364774400,5,334,5.054545454545455
7982464,1,B00008G5ZX,This is not the movie Rosie the Riveter that is so moving about the 4 women who worked in Richmond.  It is a dud narrated by a man with some footage from WWII. Don't buy it.  Amazon: be more careful in future about explaining what this is to make sure customers (like me) are buying the Rosie the Riveter movie that is better.,1207699200,22,326,4.158730158730159
7982465,2,B00008G5ZX,"This dvd features 3 episodes of the documentary series America At War:The Home Front that aired on PBS pesumably in the '90s as Eric Sevareid, the narrator, passed away in 1992. Only the first episode, ""A String of Pearls"", is about the ""Rosie the Riveter"" phenomenon of women taking over men's jobs while the men were at war. The other 2 episodes cover other aspects of the war & its effects on the warfront and have nothing to do with ""Rosie"". If you want a more comprehensive look at ""Rosie"", keep looking.",1202342400,9,509,4.543478260869565
7982466,5,B00008G5ZX,"The Home Front : Rosie The Riveter is a well-made and thoroughly engaging video documenting the role of women at home, in the workplace and in the military during World War 2.  There is lots of great footage, some you've seen and lots you probably have not seen.  Especially of interest were the newsreel and other 'propaganda' clips.  The film is divided into three sections : String of Pearls is about the women who joined the workforce when  needed after the men left for war.  They did as good a job as the men and looked good doing it.  The next section is called On The Shady Side Of The Street and is about the changing sexual mores of the time, and the quick marriages that sometimes worked and sometimes didn't.  The third section is named It's Been A Long Long Time, about the end of the war and all the GIs returning home after victory.  I really liked the film very much, and recommend it highly.  Specifically, I thought it was great that they did not try to glamorize the war, nor did they play the tragedy and heartbreak angle to get a reaction.  Also, the women, while objectified and trivialized in the newsreels and other footage of the time, are not at all looked down upon by the folks that made this video.  Quite the opposite actually.  One of my favorite dvds.",1191369600,11,1283,4.435897435897436
