8107696,5,B000E97I48,"I remember where I was and what I was doing when a friend threw this DVD in and changed my opinion on whitesnake forever. I was so blown away by this epic performance I've been a huge fan ever since and go to all the shows on the east coast US. This DVD is a must for music fans in general. Professionals at their best and the best line up Whitesnake ever had imo. Doug, Reb, Marco and tommy makes this an epic feat. Buckle up and bring a towel!",1453161600,2,445,3.9555555555555557
