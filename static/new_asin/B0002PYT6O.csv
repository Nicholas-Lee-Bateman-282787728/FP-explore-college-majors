2113102,5,B0002PYT6O,"Comedy at it's best! Cedris the Entetainer has done it! The episodes are quite hilarious, and his cast are very good. anyone who loves him, will definitely love this series! A must have!",1178582400,,186,4.666666666666667
2113103,5,B0002PYT6O,I had seen different parts of theis series and enjoyed them a while ago and could not find any store that sold it.  I am a fan of cedric since the beginning so he keeps me laughing in this entire series!  Worth the money.,1168300800,,221,4.0
2113104,3,B0002PYT6O,"Cedric the Entertainer is funny as hell but this show wasn't all that. People blame FOX for canceling this show but the critics don't lie. And it had nothing to do with the coverage of the war in Iraq because FOX had no trouble showing ""The Bernie Mac Show"". The show was just lame. The jokes were mildly funny but the recurring characters were weak (that Cafeteria Lady was funny for about two minutes). I would skip this DVD set and check out some of Cedric's movies instead like ""Kings of Comedy"" or ""Barbershop"".",1136937600,2,516,4.5
2113105,5,B0002PYT6O,"Cedric the Entertainer Presents - The Complete Series is a spectacular show! It hits every mark, and lands every joke! There are also a bunch of underestimatedly funny characters. Jingle Fever(a musical duo that is inter-racial) will make your face hurt from laughing, The unaired Shleppy and Fry Pan skits ( a black guy and a jew who tell racial jokes at places like school auditorium ) is a non-stop escapade of hilarity, and Cedric hits true comic genius with the Cafteria Lady. I think you would be doing yourself a favor if you bought or rented this DVD set. Wither your black or white, you will love this show! Hopefully, if enough people buy this, the show will be resurrected. The war caused this comedy train to stop, when it had just revved up its engine!",1122422400,5,765,4.591240875912408
2113106,4,B0002PYT6O,"I've got to start by saying that i've like Cedric's stand up for years. When I heard this show was coming on I was really excited. This show had a funny cast and I think this it would have found an audiece if it had been left on. They had some great skits like Cafetera Lady,Babies,Jingle Fever,& Love Doctor. This show also had some great dancing by the beautiful Sensation dancers. The set doesn't have any extras unless you count the unaired episodes. I'm glad released this series in one nice swoop so you won't have to commit to buying anymore sets. This set has some great laughs that was sadly cancelled before it's time so I suggest you pick this up.",1114992000,6,658,4.401639344262295
2113107,1,B0002PYT6O,"Although Cedric may get some of the proceeds, we shouldn't pay FOX for taking him off the air.  The war might have contributed to the re-cancellation of the show but they had already cancelled him before it started.  It was a good show but only lasted one season; I think you have to hit 100 to do reruns in syndication.  It was their mistake then and now they can also deal with the bad decision to bring it out on DVD after they stunted the growth of its popularity.  Just my .02.",1096848000,10,482,4.206521739130435
2113108,5,B0002PYT6O,"that this came out on DVD, and it isn't even my birthday!  Seriously, this show was a complete stitch, and it truly deserved to run for at *least* a couple of seasons.  Cedric assembled a rather talented cast, with himself as the rock-solid comedic anchor.  There are so few truly funny shows out there, so when this one hit the airwaves, it was the highlight of my TV viewing week.  When FOX cancelled this show before it even went a full season, I was seriously dejected, and moreso baffled.

In a way, the show reminded me of the old Flip Wilson Show, with Flip coming out and chatting up the audience, then moving into short comedic skits that were well crafted and thrived off the main star's true talent for making people laugh, not through crudeness or insult, but with good clean fun.

If you like the humor of Jamie Kennedy, Drew Carey, King of Queens, Simpsons, Family Guy or the like, odds are you'll enjoy Cedric's show.",1096588800,11,932,4.517857142857143
2113109,5,B0002PYT6O,"This was a great show that was cut short by FOX.  It was the middle of one episode, and the program was cut short because the US began it's war on Iraq.  The show never returned to the airwaves.  Until now!  You can own it on DVD!

Very funny characters (not sure if any reoccur because of the cut short season).  If you like shows like madTV, and Chappelle's Show, you will LOVE Cedric the Entertainer Presents.  This show is great, and I'm sure loaded with special features.  You will laugh for hours!",1094947200,8,503,4.333333333333333
2113114,5,B0002PYT6O,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!!! I AM HAVING A GOOD TIME WATCHING THIS!!! I AM SO HAPPY THAT I PURCHASED IT!!!,1412553600,,98,4.2105263157894735
2113115,4,B0002PYT6O,I liked this show back when it was on the air.  When I found that this set has six unaired episodes I decided to pick one up for those.  If you like Cedric it is a good deal.,1400198400,,174,3.5526315789473686
2113116,5,B0002PYT6O,"Great sketch comedy show with fantastic cast.  Ordering was easy and delivered promptly
Would recommend this show to any fan of sketch comedy",1393632000,,141,5.130434782608695
2113117,5,B0002PYT6O,"My family and I watch this show quite often, were talking one funny show,don't know why they ever took this show off air",1387065600,,120,4.260869565217392
2113118,5,B0002PYT6O,I had this dvd years ago when it first released and ever since then I've been trying to find it. I wish it wasn't taken off the air as soon as it was.,1378684800,,150,3.5757575757575757
2113119,3,B0002PYT6O,"While I knew very little about Cedric The Entertainer, save for a few guest appearances on TV sitcoms, I watched this FOX show when it aired in 2002 and 2003, to see if someone could breathe life into the variety show format.  It was a brave attempt, and like SNL in recent years, had its moments, but most of the show's humor was not very funny.  There is too much off-color and insult humor (the Cafeteria Lady is funny at first, but gets on your nerves after a while), and most of the other sketches are the ""same old, same old.""  I bought this DVD set, because it was cheap, and I wanted to see if the series has improved with time.  It hasn't.  While hardcore CTE fans will love this show, it doesn't have a broad enough appeal for a mass audience, which is why it was cancelled, though FOX's frequent preemptions for the 2002 baseball playoffs and World Series did not help the show's chances.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Flip-Wilson-Show/dp/B000M9CB56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Flip Wilson Show</a>&nbsp;it is definitely not.  This 3-DVD set has 22 episodes, including the pilot, as well as six that were never aired.  CTE does deserve credit for at least attempting to bring variety back to prime time; perhaps more music, and greater use of the beautiful Ced-sation dancers, would have helped.  CTE replaced Meredith Vieira on WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? in the fall of 2013.  All I can say is: CTE, you're no Regis Philbin, and you only lasted one season; in the fall of 2014, Terry Crews took over as host of WWTBAM. Supposedly, CTE left the show to ""lighten his workload,"" but I'm not sure I believe that. Crews left WWTBAM at the end of the 2014-2015 season; Chris Harrison (THE BACHELOR, and the perennial host of the Miss America Pageant) replaced him in the fall of 2015. With all these revolving hosts, maybe it's time to bring back Reege.",1376265600,,1915,4.867692307692308

2113122,5,B0002PYT6O,i've been a big fan of cedric for some time and actually having the series in hand is worth every penny! one of the funniest sitcoms ever or variety show.,1362268800,,154,4.166666666666667

2113135,5,B0002PYT6O,"I think Cedric the Entertainer is one of the funniest comics around. I had an opportunity to see some segments of the series on Comcast a few years ago, but with a host of commercials. I found out there were some episodes that never aired at the time the show went off the air. The DVD is well worth the purchase. When the show was on the air, I wished the episodes were an hour instead of just 30 minutes. Now I have the collection of all of the episodes. I loved to watch those fantastic dancers that always performed prior to Cedric making his entrance to the stage.",1348790400,,569,4.229357798165138
2113136,5,B0002PYT6O,This is hilarious!!!!  Great job!  The show really should have stayed on the air!!  The cafeteria lady character and Velvet Jones character are sooo funny!!!!

I had already opened the plastic wrap and I checked them out. They were identical and had the same content. Where oh where did disc two run off to? I was hoping to finally see all the episodes but it seems to just not be meant for me...",1324512000,,411,4.1375

2113143,4,B0002PYT6O,"Cedric is truly an entertainer.  This mystifyingly short-lived series showcases his remarkable talents and is, in ways, a throwback to the 70's when Flip Wilson and Carol Burnett hosted such shows.  The ensemble cast is excellent and it is obvious that they are having fun with each oddball role.

And at under $20, this qualifies as a super steal.  There are PG-13 moments in each episode, but for the most part, this is pretty clean fun.",1188086400,,439,4.7368421052631575
