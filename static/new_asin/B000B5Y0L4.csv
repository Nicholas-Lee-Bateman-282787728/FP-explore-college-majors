8081928,5,B000B5Y0L4,"This concert can't have too many stars.  This DVDs has Superlative playing by individual masters of their instruments, the funky gumbo of the New Orleans genre, the simple and powerfully perfect arrangements, and the quintessential icon who is called Dr. John.  Something is wrong with you if some part or parts of your body are not bomping along.",1420934400,,347,4.9655172413793105

8081930,5,B000B5Y0L4,This is a phenominal dvd!  I would recommend it to anyone that loves New Orleans Jazz or Dr. John.  I have seen Dr. John live and this is just like having a front row seat.,1358380800,,172,3.8857142857142857
8081931,5,B000B5Y0L4,"This is a good times for all concert. The Audio is very well mixed as the ""Live At Montreux"" recordings are. The Video is equally well shot and produced, in focus and less grainy than a lot of other DVD's I've seen. I have not gotten a bad recording from any ""Live at Montreux"" yet. They really seem to know what their doing there. I have a number of Dr. John's CD's, and here again I find I like the live stuff better. His New Orleans style, blues, jazz, funk fusion blend well for him. His back up band is well polished and plays together very well. This is not the OLD Dr. John, but his newer style and is very well played here. ""Right Place Wrong Time"" is up dated as well and is a little Funkier than the old version. Great entrance, performance and stylish exit make this a must have for any Dr John fan or any one who wants to broaden their listening experience's.

I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1269216000,5,1550,4.447183098591549
8081932,5,B000B5Y0L4,"This is a great concert by Dr. John and his 8 piece band. The concert consists of 13 songs, plus 3 bonus songs from a 1986 performance at Montreux. As,another reviewer pointed out,Dr. John personally picked this Montreux performance for a DVD, because, he thought it was his best performance. The Sound quality sounded great to me. I agree with most of the other reviewers, this is one great concert DVD, and I highly recommend it, thanks, and may God Bless!!",1234051200,6,459,4.679012345679013
