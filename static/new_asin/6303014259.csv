7835302,2,6303014259,"The Emperor Jones, 1933 film

It begins with natives drumming and singing in their language. The dress suggests South Africa. The scene shifts to modern times, a religious meeting. Brutus Jones has a job that requires travel on the railroad as a Pullman Porter. The job involves polishing shoes, a good job gets bigger tip. In the big city he joins a party. He has another girlfriend. He overhears conversations in the Pullman coach about an investment. They show the acts in a night club. Two women fight. The next scene is a pool hall, men roll dice on the table. The stakes are raised. The dice are crooked! There is a fight with a knife; one man falls to the floor. Next we see convicts breaking rocks. They sing as they work. There is harsh punishment!

Jones hides in a truck to runaway. He finds a home to help him leave the country on a steamer. Then he jumps ship to swim to an island. Armed men bring him before the ruler. A white trader buys him for five silver dollars and offers him a job. A dice game distributes goods. Jones promotes himself to a partnership. Smithers offers his bill to the ruler; is there a little error? Three is a palace coup, Jones is ruler by brains (and a little magic). Taxes are raised to pay off the National Debt. The Emperor buys new clothes, and his palace is redecorated. The people resent this. ""A little stealing puts you in jail, big stealing makes you an Emperor."" [Do clothes make the man?]

The Court assembles. Prisoners are whipped for beating a tax collector. A village will be burned to the ground in reprisal. Smithers tells Jones what happened today. Is the game up? People have fled to the hills, when will they attack? Jones hears the drums and leaves the palace. The tempo increases. Is he lost in the woods? He talks to himself as he wanders. He sees a ghost and fires his pistol. He discards his fancy jacket. Then he imagines himself back on the chain gang. Is he going in circles? He prays for forgiveness. Then he meets his fate. And so it ends.

This drama is a lesson in politics, a warning against unlimited power. Does this story seem realistic? I assume its portrayal of life in the 1930s is accurate. Drinking and gambling often lead to a killing (as in the pictures of the Wild West by Frederic Remington). It seems unrealistic in having a stranger take over a small country. Usually there is a group that supports a ruler, like an aristocracy of the wealthy (or an officer corps). Even in small gangs, one man rules with the help of others. Think of Chicago in the 1920s or Cleveland in the 1930s. This is based on the play by Eugene O'Neill. [""Emperor Jones"" was the name of a Cleveland Ohio gangster in the 1930s.]",1408233600,,2690,4.450304259634889
7835303,5,6303014259,"Having regard to the fact that ""Emperor Jones"" is Robeson's first major film role, the quality of both picture and sound is outstanding and far above copies of later films, which I purchased at the same time. The ""Tribute"" is extremely moving and informative and an absolute MUST for any Robeson fan. I have nothing but the highest praise for its quality. Home Vision are to be commended.",1014854400,6,388,4.720588235294118
