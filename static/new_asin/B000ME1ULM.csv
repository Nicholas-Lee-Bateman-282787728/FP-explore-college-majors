8168101,5,B000ME1ULM,My husband and I saw this on PBS long ago and have always wanted to have a copy of this to watch as it hasn't been broadcasted since we originally saw it! This is a WONDERFUL play with a GREAT cast!,1414195200,,198,3.8536585365853657
8168102,5,B000ME1ULM,"I saw this on PBS when it first aired.  It was presented live as a radio play, with actors, musicians and sound effect people visible to the audience.  Bill Pullman was perfect as George Bailey as was all the supporting actors.  I enjoyed it so much I looked for a copy on-line.  Several years later I was successful in finding a copy and enjoy it very much especially around the holidays.  I would give in a resounding 10.",1286064000,6,423,4.371794871794871
