8172470,5,B000MUNYU6,"Although my parents never owned this collection, it was a whole new thing at the time by marketing music videos strictly by African American artists.  In 1984, not too many folks had BET plus MTV was not showing videos by African American artists unless it was Lionel Richie, Prince, or Michael Jackson.  Local programs such as New York Hot Tracks, Music Video Connection, and Video Music Box showcased almost exclusively recent black music videos and sneaking in some old ones too. Most of the videos on this collection were released in 1981-1982 and many were commercially unknown until the released of this vhs.

As you can see, you get the best of the best by Earth Wind & Fire, Kool & The Gang, Shalamar, Midnight Star, Rick James, Ray Parker Jr, Stephanie Mills, and Lakeside all in one complete package.  If you didn't have BET in the early 80's, this vhs is the first time you saw the colorful and spacey ""Let's Groove"", the festive ""A Night To Remember"", the flashy ""Get Down On It"", the black version of ""The Other Woman"" and the other good stuff!  Many of the videos were simple and budget fixed, yet creative and alot better than what MTV was showing before Michael released ""Billie Jean.""  As of today, VH1 Classics doesn't even play videos like these anymore and neither does BETJ (targeted to those that remember nostalgic BET).  Although we have youtube and other networks on the internet where lucky individuals are generous to share these videos, every fan of classic soul music should own a copy of Kool Street.  Hurry up because theres only one left and getting it on eBay will cost you an arm and a leg!",1219449600,,1624,4.653846153846154
