First off, the DVDs are coded for Region 2 and require a DVD player capable of reading these DVD. There are DVD players on Amazon with region free setting that can do the job.

Now, about the discs. The menus, the previews and the obligatory warnings are in Japanese. The audio and subtitles are available both in English (original language) and Japanese (local language), but if I can provide the Japanese characters in the menu in here I can help. That or use photos. This review will be updated as I work through this and the 3 other box sets.
