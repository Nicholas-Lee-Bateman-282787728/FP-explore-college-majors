8030731,5,B0002PYT00,"Jack Benny was one of the funniest man ever. He could make ""cheap""
hilarious. But the best thing about this one is the guest
appearance of Humphrey Bogart. You will roll in the aisles with
glee. Probably one of the funniest skits I have ever seen and I have been around a great amount of years!",1284768000,,294,4.267857142857143
8030732,4,B0002PYT00,"This DVD is great if you are a Jack Benny fan, which my husband and I are.  The problem is, when I purchased it for my husband, it said on Amazon that it had CC, something my husband needs because of his hearing disability.  When we went to play it, it was very disappointing for him that there was no CC on it.  Since, I'm assuming only older generations are going to be Jack Benny fans, you would think that CC would always be included on this type of DVD.",1221696000,2,458,4.066666666666666
8030733,4,B0002PYT00,"In my opinion, Volume Two is a much better DVD than Volume One.  Again, the DVD has a limited amount of episodes, only four.  But the quality of these episodes is much greater.

Episode One is a re-enactment of a Jack Benny radio show from 1953.  The transition between the TV and radio program falls very nicely.  Episode Two is a classic with Humphrey Bogart playing ""babyface"" Bogart, a crook and is being questioned by who else?  Captain O'Benny.  Episode Three is a celebration of Don Wilson's 27th anniversary working for Jack.  I wonder if he will ever get paid?  And, Episode Four includes a performance by Liberace.  Not the most comedic episode and probably my least favorite of the group but the other three make up for this.",1215302400,2,736,4.635658914728682
8030734,5,B0002PYT00,This DVD has 4 shows - and they are absolutely hilarious - I've watched this several times already and it's incredible.  I love Jack Benny's comedy and I dont' know what else to say -,1168300800,9,183,4.228571428571429
