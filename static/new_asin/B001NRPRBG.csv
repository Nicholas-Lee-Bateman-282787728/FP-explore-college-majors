8327831,5,B001NRPRBG,"disregard the nincompoop who gave this one star. i will admit i was a little bit skeptical about buying this because i saw that marty balin wasn't on it, so i rented it on netflix. guess what? it's a great performance of kantner, tim gorman, diana mangano& slick aguilar in an intimate club setting. kantner really shines here, playing his 12string guild and on some tracks, he even busts out the banjo for baby tree and one other number. great rendition of jorma kaukonen's volunteers era jam, good shepherd. other highlights for me include sketches of china, wooden ships, white rabbit, and somebody to love. this set focuses on a lot of more obscure numbers and the whole band sounds great: great interplay between kantner, aguilar, and the keyboardist. Diana Mangano provides strong vocal support throughout. For a dedicated Jefferson-head like myself, it's the perfect elixir-mother's milk. get it!",1331856000,3,903,5.067114093959732
8327832,5,B001NRPRBG,"My title is a response to a previous reviewer. As a longtime Jefferson Airplane/Starship fan, I found this very enjoyable.
Paul's voice hasn't changed much with age, and he obviously still enjoys making music. I was pleasantly surprised by Diana Mngano. Her voice is very strong, blends well with Paul's voice and comes as close as anyone will ever get to sounding like Grace Slick. She's also nice to look at as she dances and sways to the music. I enjoyed her versions of SKETCHES OF CHINA and especially, BE YOUNG YOU, which she sang acapella. Slick Aguilar's guitar playing was very good and fit well in the stripped down set, which included some of my Airplane and Starship favorites.
It would have been nice to have had the presence of Marty Balin, but other than a couple of obscure folk songs, that is my only complaint.",1284249600,2,828,4.639455782312925
8327833,1,B001NRPRBG,"With the scarcity of video available of this music, I was very eager to watch this especially after reading the first two reviews. But half way through my wife and I looked at each other and wondered how embarrassing it was to watch. Did they ever rehearse ?  Although the video is excellent for a small club, and I'm not sure there were more than 20 people there because far less than that were clapping for an encore, the music was really poorly delivered.

What a waste ....",1243555200,,477,4.409090909090909
8327834,5,B001NRPRBG,"A semi-acoustic show with a stripped down version of this illustrious band featuring space captain Paul Kantner on vocals and 12-string. Supplemented by long time collaborator Slick Aguilar on some stellar lead and the always discrete but reliable Chris Smith on keys. And the beautiful Diana Mangano providing the female vocals.

The repertoire is varied and diverse, comprising tributes to Kantner's roots in folk music with songs like ""Girl In The Wood"" and ""Keep Away"". Some Jefferson Airplane classics like ""White Rabbit"", ""Good Sheperd"" and a very strong ""Wooden Ships"". And a healthy dose of material from ""Blows Against The Empire"": a banjo-driven ""Baby Tree"" and the suite of ""Sunshine>Have You Seen The Stars Tonight>Starship"", where Aguilar once again showcases his abilities as psychedelic guitarist.

The vocals - often a weak point in later days Starship shows - are strong and brilliant, with Aguilar providing extra harmony. And while Diana isn't in the same league as the divine Grace Slick, she's certainly a fine vocalist with a warm human radiance.

A strong and intimate show. Great sound quality. Uplifting and essential for all Jefferson fans and for lovers of well-crafted music with strong psychedelic roots.",1241481600,10,1233,5.312820512820513
