2614265,4,B000GIXEVS,"If you're a fan of early/mid-1960s B-movies and TV shows, you'll get a kick out of this little black and white espionage picture.  It's somewhat more reminiscent of an early episode of The Man From UNCLE or Amos Burke, Secret Agent than James Bond.  It is particularly recommended for fans of two of the lovliest exotic starlets or the era -- Aliza Gur and Edina Ronay.",1167782400,15,369,4.575757575757576

8132905,3,B000GIXEVS,"My, but those filmmakers love their night train movies! Anyhow NTTP is a bumpy concoction of neo-Hitchcock mixed with the Old School Greene/Le Carr spy story, filtered through the prism of the Swinging Sixties. Befitting the film's eminently B movie pedigree, sometimes the brew works, and sometimes it does not. In many ways NTTP has the retro look and feel of a Fifties film, right down to the smoky, frenetic, jazzy score.  Leslie Nielsens star power pretty much carries the film but its all fairly skillfully done, especially the direction and b&w photography.
Theres an especially creepy scene early on in an enclosed back alley where a thuggish bad guy closes in on a hapless informer. A major misfire is the raucous New Years Eve party on-board the train, which among other things goes on far too long. My experience has been that train movies are most effective when done low-keyed, the more so the better.
Along the way a bevy of Sixties-style beauties alternatingly tempt, annoy and betray Nielsen, but nominal femme fatale Aliza Gur is perilously close to being upstaged by the fetching Dorinda Stevens, who enters the film about half way through. NNTP has a short run time (65 min.) and suffers from what seems a hasty, truncated denouement. This one may not be a masterpiece, far from it. But with all its imperfections its still very easy to watch. Three stars.",1444953600,2,1375,4.851063829787234
8132906,1,B000GIXEVS,"Night Train To Paris is a very modest thriller. The DVD is a ""flipper"" with a wide screen version on one side and a pan and scan version on the other. The picture quality is quite good. Unfortunately the widescreen version I received has a severe fault which causes the film to "" freeze"" after about 20 minutes. This means that in practice I can only watch the pan and scan version. I am not pleased.",1441324800,2,400,4.276315789473684
8132907,3,B000GIXEVS,"Night Train to Paris (1964) is a bit short on the thrills or intrigue, in fact, it really has neither.  The director was more interested in filling up the time with useless 60's music and boring drunks.  Aliza Gur is dull as an actress.  Leslie Nielsen exhibits no tough rawness as he does in television as in Alfred Hitchcock Presents (19581961), Thriller (1960) or Kraft Suspense Theatre (1963-1965).

He wears plastic black horn-rimmed glasses with attached eyebrows, large plastic nose, bushy moustache as a disguise.  Yeah, stupid.

For train buffs, it has a train ferry (a ship or ferry designed to carry railway vehicles).  It was probably the Dover to Dunkirk line, from Britain.  (It stopped in 1992 due to the opening of the Channel Tunnel).

There's some cool jazz music and the intro is a nice assemblage, but that's it.

8132909,3,B000GIXEVS,"Night Train to Paris, 1964 film

A man stands in a telephone booth, another man approaches. A package is exchanged for an envelope of cash. Another man observes them, then follows the seller into an alley. Where is the tape? The man won't talk. Elsewhere people try to travel from London to Paris on New Years Eve, but trains and airplanes are booked up. A woman asks about passage for a couple. Alan agrees, he has a plan. They won't leave together, that attracts attention. Arrangements are made. [Dont leave your front door unlocked!] That tape has important military information, it must be delivered to one man alone. What if that fat man with glasses shows up? Then he calls the police. Alan gets away to the Night Ferry. The police are on his trail. So too that fat man. Where can that package be hidden? [Is that a safe place?] The sleeping train leaves.

The police search Alans flat. The travelers must stay in their compartments while the police search the train. Can Alan hide from them? Its New Years Eve, people celebrate. Alan's compartment was searched, the tape is gone! The train is loaded aboard the ship, which then leaves port. That killer is on the train. Will a model talk to the police? [How did that model know that Alan wasn't Georges?] The passengers celebrate, they don't know what is happening. The police learn more, they will fly to Dunkirk and meet the French police. The older model, Olive Davis, has a surprise for Alan. A man in a bear suit leads Alan away to a hidden location ashore. There is a struggle, Alan drops the tape. The younger model has a surprise for Alan! Not you, too! The police arrive at that factory and capture the villains. That tape will be delivered to the correct official.

This is an interesting story. Part of it reminds me of The Thirty-Nine Steps, but a shorter version that is still entertaining. The scenes tell about the culture of that era. Do they still have boat trains? This recorded them, like the old Westerns that showed horse-drawn wagons. Leslie Nielsen would act in many comic movies, like Wrongfully Accused (a parody of The Fugitive).",1427328000,,2113,4.644385026737968
8132910,2,B000GIXEVS,"It is worth watching to see Leslie Nielsen, if you are a fan of his and have only seen him in his comedy spoof roles like Airplane, Naked Gun, and others. He looks 30 years younger, but his voice is exactly the same.

It is an odd experience to watch him in this serious dramatic role because he is not much different from the character he plays in comedic roles 3 decades later. You can almost imagine him being that same character in this role. I do not mean that as a criticism of the director, rather that someone must have looked at this performance and thought, Hey, that actor would be super as a bumbling police detective!

Other than that I cannot recommend it.",1369267200,,670,4.352
8132911,3,B000GIXEVS,"Amazon's product specs incorrectly suggest this Fox release of 'Night Train to Paris' (U.K., 1964) is offered only in fullscreen format, while in actuality the disc is a flipper containing both a 1.33:1 and 1.66:1 aspect-ratio option.  Low-budget locomotive intrigue is played with a palatable mix of camp and seriousness (who better than Leslie Nielsen to serve as figurative conductor?), making NTTP an entertaining, albeit superficial, mystery/thriller.  A jazzy '60s score (with pop soundtrack to match), fine supporting cast of period familiars, and a trio of Europe's most fetching B-list sexpots add to the time-capsule factor.  DVD features a crisp b&w print, clear sound and theatrical trailer.  2 1/2 stars for the film; 3 1/2 for presentation.",1365897600,5,754,5.418803418803419
