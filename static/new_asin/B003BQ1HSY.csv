4107383,5,B003BQ1HSY,"`Raffles' is a sophisticated, Victorian, aristocracy Robin Hood thief that robs from the rich and KEEPS IT. Such fun. A revolutionary form of a British crime series. Thievery is vulgar, Raffles admits, but he, when in need, feels justified. His lifestyle of the rich-&-famous makes him needy often. The London Victorian era crime is presented from the thief's point of view. Raffles considers himself a virtuous thief--only doing it to keep debts current and remain socially elite. Quite right-good show. You've never seen anything quite like it.

A.J.Raffles (Anthony Valentine-`Callan' 'Coronation Street' `The Commander') is cool, witty, and London's finest diamond thief, his favorite heist. He dresses impeccably, as does all the cast due to well earned Best Costume and Make-Up award nominations. Delightful & historical Victorian sets/props/costumes.
Costumes are lovely, from nightgowns to evening ware. Raffles has an old school chum, Bunny Manders (Christopher Strauli-`Only When I Laugh' `Full House') who is definitely not as `quick' as Raffles, a bit socially awkward, but helpful, especially when someone is needed to take a fall, or a bump or two. Poor Bunny, Raffles should treat him better. Bunny strives to do his share, make himself worthy.

This strikingly different British Crime Series is based on original writing by E.W. Hornung. His bio is included in the bonus material.
NO subtitles, but unnecessary for accent.
The 14 episodes begin with the PILOT, exclusively DVD available here.
A period series that already has a cult-like following and will live forever due to its unusual perspective to burglary.

For those liking episode details without spoilers:
1-Pilot THE AMATEUR CRACKSMAN-Raffles & Bunny head for the country cricket games (and some diamond heisting.) They have competition from other crooks plus Inspector Mackenzie (Victor Carin).
2 THE FIRST STEP-Raffles helps Bunny rob to pay off the mate's gambling debt. This episode was the launch of the series.
3 A COSTUME PIECE-Weak-nerved Bunny again joins Raffles in a rob-from-the-arrogant-rich scheme. What else are friends for?
4 THE SPOILS OF SACRILEGE-Bunny takes charge of the new caper--well, till his plans cause problems.
5 THE GOLD CUP-Raffles & Bunny steal `The Gold Cup', are tracked & suspected, leaving Raffles a need to prove coppers wrong when they're right.
6 THE CHEST OF SILVER-Raffles own silverware & Sterling heirlooms (previously stolen) is burgled from a London bank vault. Bunny's bum is bared briefly!! The only found explanation for the DVD box cover warning of partial nudity.
7 THE LAST LAUGH-Raffles & bunny take a higher step in stealing by adding a beautiful Italian girl to the jewelry booty. Dastard diplomacy.
8 A TRAP TO CATCH A CRACKSMAN-An American boxing champ's trophies is the latest test of snatching skills for the pilfering pair.
9 TO CATCH A THIEF-London has more than one gentleman thief. Our diabolical duo, ungentlemanly, goes after his heisted board. Robert Hardy (All Creatures Great and Small) is the other thief.
10 A BAD NIGHT-Bunny attempts a one-man heist on a millionaire's home while Raffles joins the England Cricket team. Double trouble as a rival thief works the same job.
11 MR JUSTICE RAFFLES-Raffles gets involved with loan sharks and double-crosses, making him come across as the `really NICE guy.'
12 HOME AFFAIRS-Raffles takes on a political figure--goes to steal what that man owns--Bunny bungles--and Mackenzie is on their tail.
13 THE GIFT OF THE EMPEROR-Who'd over thought it? Raffles is asked by the government to steal. Help is promised from Scotland Yard & even Insp. Mackenzie (the very man who wants Raffles behind bars.)
14 AN OLD FLAME-Raffles is caught in a burgle, but by an `Old Flame', who wants rekindled. Can raffles get out of this one?",1272412800,46,3806,5.2360655737704915

This TV series stays fairly true to the characters of Raffles and Bunny (the criminal version of Sherlock and Watson), but most would only appreciate this short lived series if they were familiar with E.W.

4107394,3,B003BQ1HSY,"As an avid fan and collector of mystery books and videos, I was disappointed with Anthony Valentine as Raffles.  Perhaps, as a reader one tends to envision the character in one's own way.  Movies tend to disappoint after reading the book(s).  Valentine was not who I ""pictured"" - too flippant.  Raffles (per the author) was highly intelligent and fun - not sassy.  I actually was bored with several of the episodes - same old, same old acting.  Valentine appears to be a ""one face"" actor in these.  I got used to the ""stage setting"" (as the BBC has done w/other productions).  The BBC has done much better: ie: Miss Marple, Sherlock Holmes (no matter who played the leads in both).  This item will sit on the shelf.

By pinching jewels from the wealthy, Raffles and Bunny are able to maintain their upper middle class lifestyle  using a bit of Robin Hood logic to justify their crimes (robbing from the rich to help the poor - the poor being themselves).  The original author was E. W. Hornung, the brother-in-law to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Hornung wanted to create a criminal character as a foil to the ever popular Sherlock Holmes.

Unfortunately, my rating has to be 4 stars because ACORN didn't add subtitles, something that I thought all DVDs were supposed to have.  I'm not hard-of-hearing, but sometimes the audio or a thick accent garbles a word and that takes away from the overall enjoyment of the experience.

Still...If you want to have a good time with a likable scoundrel and his sidekick, I recommend RAFFLES.  It's a wonderful way to while-away an afternoon, sipping tea and laughing at upper class high-jinks and impecunious young men inadvertently saving the day.",1292976000,8,739,4.833333333333333

4107410,5,B003BQ1HSY,"""Raffles: The Complete Collection "" gives us another classic British mysteries television series, made in the 1970's, but set in Victorian England. The underlying stories, of the adventures of a gentleman thief, were based on the popular novels penned by E.W. Hornung, brother-in-law of Arthur Conan Doyle, famed creator of the iconic Sherlock Holmes. The entertainment was made by Yorkshire Television for Britain's ITV (Independent Television Network) stations.  The pilot episode, included here, but oddly enough never broadcast, nor released before, was made in 1975.  The thirteen episode series aired in 1977. The lavishly produced entertainment was nominated for three BAFTA Awards.  All fourteen episodes now come to us in a box set of four DVDs, running approximately 726 minutes. Unfortunately, as the series itself warns, due to its age, it was not always possible for the producers to bring the visuals, or soundtrack, up to current standards.  Nor are there subtitles; some viewers may have a bit of trouble over this.  I did.  However, I cranked up the volume on my TV, and, while I may have missed some of the dialog, I was able to follow the action perfectly well.

This period crime drama is unusual, in that it centers on a criminal, rather than a detective, amateur or professional, as a dashing aristocrat, and first-class cricketer, turns criminal in order to support his chosen lifestyle.  We meet A.J. Raffles, (Anthony Valentine,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commander-Set-1/dp/B001B43IW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commander Set 1</a>), gentleman of leisure, ladies man, and cricketer.  But he's got a secret: when he's not dining at his club, dancing at a ball, or taking wickets for England, he's probably engaged in relieving the wealthy of their riches.  In these enterprises, he is aided and abetted by his old school chum, ""Bunny Manders,"" (Christopher Strauli,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-When-I-Laugh/dp/B00009ME9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only When I Laugh</a>); and I must say, Bunny is a fine comic creation, light-footed as can be, congratulations, Mr. Strauli.  And, of course, Raffles is pursued by the dogged Scotland Yard Inspector Mackenzie, (Victor Carin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sutherland-s-Law-Entire-Series-One/dp/B003E21K8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sutherland's Law - Entire Series One</a>).

The series bespeaks the open-handed care with which ITV made these entertainments at that time. Settings, clothing, accessories, sounds, interiors, street scenes and transport are depicted as accurately as they could be. Streets are full of bicycles, horse-drawn vehicles, and pedestrians.  Ballrooms are full of dancers. Scenes are filmed lavishly, with many extras, a screen packed full of information. Scripts are intelligently written, and ably acted, featuring several of the stars of the day; support is provided by many contemporary favorites. The episodes are:
1. The Amateur Cracksman. The pilot episode.  Raffles and Bunny travel to a country estate, supposedly to play cricket, actually to steal a priceless diamond and sapphire necklace from a Marchioness.  They discover there are another pair of jewelry thieves there, as is Insp. Mackenzie.  It just makes it more fun for the roguish Raffles.
2. The First Step.  Raffles is visited in his rooms at the Albany by his old friend Bunny, who has lost too much money at baccarat, and will shortly bounce two checks, and be socially ruined.  Raffles himself is dead broke.  So....
3. A Costume Piece.  Reuben Rosenthal, brash, rude Cockney ""rough diamond,"" who made himself a fortune in South Africa, wears his wealth ostentatiously.  He's a natural target - but he's got a few surprises up his sleeve.
4. The Spoils of Sacrilege.  Bunny wants more responsibility on the jobs: so the next one is his to plan and execute.  But as things go wrong, Raffles must take charge.
5. The Gold Cup.  Raffles and Bunny find a famous, beautiful gold cup at the British Museum just too tempting.  So they swipe it.  But they are tracked down by a club of amateur criminologists, who suspect the young men.  Raffles finds an ingenious way out.
6. The Chest of Silver.  Bunny helps Raffles by depositing a chest of valuable--stolen--silver at his bank, as Raffles leaves for Scotland. Mackenzie thinks this is his chance, the none-too-bright Bunny on his own.  But the bank vault is burgled, and Raffles unexpectedly shows up early.  An extremely charming, light-hearted production that shows Raffles installing new-fangled electricity, and a telephone, in his rooms at the Albany.
7. The Last Laugh.  A display of jewelry at the Italian Embassy is just too tempting, as is a beautiful young maid there, who is in the power of the slimy ambassador. Raffles hatches a plan to steal both, but underestimates the ambassador's wiliness and thirst for revenge.
8. A Trap to Catch a Cracksman.  Raffles is tempted by the wealth of a loudmouth Irish-American champion boxer; but the boxer is smarter than he looks.  Bunny plays a substantial part in saving the day.
9. To Catch a Thief.  Suddenly there's another gentleman thief in London, and that makes one too many.  Robert Hardy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winston-Churchill-The-Wilderness-Years-1929-1939/dp/B0007TV64S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years 1929 - 1939</a>) plays Lord Ernest Bevan, copycat thief, whom Raffles and Bunny track down to relieve him of some of his booty.  But clever as Raffles is, Bevan is also smart, and quite ruthless.
10. A Bad Night.  Raffles plans to rob a Dutch millionaire's home, but must play cricket for England some distance away on the designated weekend.  Bunny volunteers to do the job himself, but it becomes a sticky wicket.
11. Mr. Justice Raffles.  A cricket friend of Raffles', played by the young Charles Dance(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plenty/dp/0782010660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plenty</a>), is in trouble with a ruthless moneylender.  Raffles agrees to help his friend, and then to take on a job for the moneylender.  But when the moneylender double-crosses him, Raffles takes summary justice.  A locked door, sealed room mystery, in which the very Dickensian looking actor John Savident plays the very Dickensian moneylender Brigstock.
12. Home Affairs.  Raffles takes it personally when the pompous Home Affairs Secretary, played by Graham Crowder--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-God-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0035JHYIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for God: The Complete Series</a>--threatens draconian punishment for property offenses.  But a slipup by Bunny appears to put them, at last, in Mackenzie's grasp.
13. Reasons of State.  The government asks Raffles to relieve an employee of the militarist German Kaiser, visiting England, of a priceless black pearl.  And they ask the long-suffering Mackenzie to help him. Of course, Raffles' plans for the pearl differ from those of Mackenzie, or the government.
14. An Old Flame.  Raffles burgles an elegant home, and is caught red-handed by a former lover of his, the beautiful Lady Paulton, played by Caroline Blakiston(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agathie-Christie-s-Miss-Marple-The-Moving-Finger-At-Bertram-s-Hotel/dp/B000M1LYIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agathie Christie's Miss Marple - The Moving Finger / At Bertram's Hotel</a>.  She is trapped in a loveless marriage, and ready to walk away from it - with Raffles.  But Raffles likes his life as it is, and takes extreme measures to preserve it.

The shows are worth the effort: they exude British wit and charm, as they chronicle the charmed life of the gentleman thief in Britain's upper crust.  And give us, by the way, an excellent view of time and place, Victorian era popular culture; the many economic ills of the day.  Just a final word to the wise: familiarity with cricket helps.",1284681600,6,8165,5.8472573839662445
4107411,2,B003BQ1HSY,"A lackluster production based on a great series. Hollywood did a much better job.

4107413,4,B003BQ1HSY,"Imaginative, witty, clever and chic, here is a series which can charm everyone, unless of course one happens to be a member of the British aristocracy who drip with diamonds, rubies or pearls (preferably diamonds).  Anthony Valentine (a name not too well known in North America) lends his considerable acting talents to the character of RAFFLES, a superb high-class gentleman who maintains his place in society by robbing from the very rich.  However, unlike the famous Robin Hood of a much earlier era, Raffles does not redistribute the fabulous wealth to the poor; rather, he keeps it for himself and shares it with his faithful side-kick, Mr. Bunny  Manders (Christopher Strauli).  ""After all, good fellow, there are certain standards to maintain!""
  In every episode there are faces with whom those who watch BBC, or Acorn, or Ecosse Films are very familiar.  It is one thing about British actors: they will take any part, no matter how small, and do a superb job of it. So, the very fact that there are so many of them means we see them again and again.  And, they continue to do wonderful jobs in any part.
  The plots in this series are very convoluted and one often is asea as to how Raffles comes up with some of the things he assumes, but those are part of the total charm.  There are a couple of murders, but nothing the least bit gory.  In fact, there is no profanity, no sex, no mad=cap chases, no blood-baths...only good clean fun.  Not only that, it is SO VERY ENGLISH in every respect.  The writers seem to take particular care to poke fun at British mannerisms, and in fact, all of the British stereotypes.
  If you have to see blood and gore, explosions, wild adventure and the like, forget RAFFLES.  But if you like to be entertained and delighted at the impossible plot-lines, droll statements, clever assumptions and plain superb acting, then RAFFLES is exactly what you want.",1279584000,25,1897,4.7
