3462317,5,B001AQMBDM,"Brief comments on the Blu-ray.  I feel like a woodpecker in a lumberyard! Folks, this is one of the really GREAT digital re-masters and transfers to Blu-ray out there.  The video is clear, and a thousand times improved over my DVD version.  The color pops, blacks are deep, and the re-master isn't so slick you lose all of the original feel of the print.  There's a little noise and grain (if you sit three inches away from the screen you might be able to see it).

The commentary with Lucas is excellent.  Plenty of other reviews on the story and the screenplay, etc.  This is an American treasure, now looking and sounding as good as you could ever hope.  Highly recommend the Blu-ray.  It is a BIG upgrade over the DVD.",1306886400,17,722,4.450381679389313
3462318,5,B001AQMBDM,"...that the director of this masterpiece would later build most of his fortune on releasing dreck like the second Star Wars trilogy and repackaging and re-releasing his three most popular films in ever increasingly ruined cuts?  This film shows the potentially great artist that we lost to capitalistic greed.  It certainly adds to the poignancy of this film's nostalgia for ""simpler"" times.",1301184000,5,391,5.290322580645161

3462500,5,B001AQMBDM,"There are several overlaying plans and plots with many independent scenes from the era (1962). Is it wiser to go off to school or stay local? What are the consequences of your intent and then final action on friends and loved ones.

Yep everyone sees themselves in this movie. I have to admit I do also. That is see all the others as of courses I am above that sort of thing. This is one of the closest depictions of life with out me having to pull out the 8mm and filming. I spent some time in L.A. around the era and moved to Texas to find that distance changes something's but not that way of life. While in Vietnam I was even able to exchange the same urban legends with people from different part of the US.
I am more surprised that George Locus could capture this so well. I am also amazed at the crew they were able to assemble for this film. Most of them went off to do bigger and better parts and it is fun to watch this film in hind sight. Everyone look so young. I really never noticed Harrison Ford until Star Wars.

Getting away from memory lane, the film is so smooth that you forgot that you are watching a movie and the actors do not overwhelm the characters that they play.

Starting out you notice a song or two and think where was I. Then a few more songs and you soon are more rapped up in the music than the story. Having Wolfman Jack there added a touch of reality. I can not put my finger on it but there was something more than formula in this particular movie.

I am not that sensitive but the ending hits you hard as you realize it will never be the same. This is true of any group in any era. I can almost forget that.

By the way the original T-bird styling is back. All in all this is one film that will not collect dust.",1502582400,3,1750,4.075581395348837

3462695,5,B001AQMBDM,"I must say this is one of the BEST movies of all time in my book! I am a big movie buff and this is right up there. George Lucas did a fantastic job in 1973 to bring us the story of several American teens on one summer night in '62. They are all friends in one way or another and have one last night of good times, all the while thinking of what the future may hold for each of them. This movie has NEVER looked so good! I used to own the DVD, but this is outstanding! The video quality is far superior to anything that has been released before. The sound is DTS HD 2.0, but that is ok as the music for the film comes out perfect.
An all star cast including Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfus, Mackenzie Phillips, Paul Le Mat, Harrison Ford, Charlie Martin Smith, Susan Richardson, Wolfman Jack, Suzanne Sommers. I was VERY fortunate enough to have met Ms. Candy Clark and got her to autograph my cover for this movie. She was very nice and lovely in person.

in front of the Ashburn high school which they brought right back and put in our high school front door the night before the

3462817,3,B001AQMBDM,"The rating is for the Blu-ray. Not the film. American Graffiti will always be a 5 STAR Classic. It's Number 77 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies.

VIDEO: Depending on the shot, the quality over the Standard Def DVD ranges from a vast improvement to almost no difference at all. Tech reviews around the web complained about DNR (digital noise reduction) and EE (edge enhancement). I didn't notice it much, but you can surely see it in the halos around some of the street lamps and the car headlights. In some of the scenes the colors just POP like never before. Other scenes are just as dark and grainy as they've ever been, with little or no improvement at all. There is an inconsistency to the look that is somewhat distracting. But it's always been there because of the original film quality in the various shots or scenes. I do love the look of this transfer. Considering this was shot in 1973 on 35mm film on a low budget mostly at night, this is probably the best this film will ever look. Unless of course they give this to Criterion for archival preservation. Video gets 4.0/5.0

AUDIO: This where Universal blew it. The mix is DTS HD 2.0. No sound was coming out of my Center speaker/channel. All audio was coming out of my Forward L/R (left/right) channels including dialogue. Disconcerting, to say the least. The Standard Def DVD has DOLBY 2.0 audio (PCM analog) which allows my surround receiver to simulate Pro-Logic stereo. Sound comes out of the Center and Forward L/R speakers. To utilize the Pro-Logic and get the soundtrack to come out of my Center and L/R channels on this BD I had to change the AUDIO settings on my Blu-ray player to DOWNMIX the coaxial signal to PCM (analog). Why should I have to change my player settings every time I want to play this BD? Everyone's A/V set-up is different, but Universal could have just added the alternate DOLBY 2.0 in the AUDIO SET-UP.

People that are complaining about the audio are dead-on. The volume levels are all over the map. Up/down. Up/down. One minute I'm cranking up the volume to hear the dialogue, the next minute I'm falling off the couch because Chuck Berry is blasting out of my stereo. I shouldn't have to watch a movie with the remote in my lap. This soundtrack is in dire need of a REMASTER. The excuse is that it would have ruined the intent of the director. Yeah, I get it. The music should sound like it's coming out of an old mono car radio speaker. But, I think it's just cheap and lazy. Is it really that hard to normalize the dialogue levels and push some of the music into the Forward L/R channels? Because of its age, no reasonable person expects the mix to utilize the rear effects speakers or the LFE/subwoofer. But, in this day and age of hi-tech A/V you would think these techs would be able to figure this out and make it presentable. Maybe they just don't care. I do. Universal has done this to me before with the BD of ""Scarface."" (Too much black crush. Changing the audio by re-recording the weapons Foley on the soundtrack to make them sound modern. Everyone seems to love it but me. It makes me cringe whenever I hear it. STOP tinkering with these classic films!) Unbelievable. When they need to remaster something, they don't. When they need to leave it alone, they tinker with it. ARGH! Universal, I HATE YOU! Audio gets 1.5/5.0

NOTE ON FEATURES: Universal is notorious for taking the film documentaries from their older SD DVDs and making them picture-in-picture on BD instead of just making them EXTRAS. They did this with John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and I hate it. The BD for American Graffiti contains the same GREAT 90 min documentary on the making of AG that is on the SD DVD and THANK GOD! it's in the EXTRAS.

Is this Classic film worth an upgrade? I'd say flip a coin. If you love this flick like I do, the BD is a must own. The BD VIDEO upgrade is very GOOD. But, there is absolutely no upgrade to the AUDIO from the SD DVD as far as I'm concerned except that it's digital instead of analog. I defy anyone except maybe an audio expert to tell the difference.

Terry The Toad still makes the best screen entrance in film history. It never fails to make me laugh.

Hope this helps. Act accordingly.",1378684800,5,4204,4.494764397905759

The film looks surprisingly good, considering the age and low budget. Audio fairs slightly worse, with dialogue sometimes tending to go just beyond earshot, but the movie's incredible soundtrack has never sounded better.

Extras are satisfying for the most part, despite the fact that the only significant new feature, a video commentary by George Lucas, covers most of the same ground as the making-of documentary.

I noticed an improvement in the color quality over the DVD version;  colors seem to be more vivid. Sound quality was about the same as the DVD (the film was originally done in optical track stereo) and will sound especially nice when listening in a surround sound enhanced mode.
Given the low budget for shooting this film, the issues about seeing the same cars too many times in too many places or that the years and models are not quite right for the period is excusable considering that this is far better than never having this masterpiece produced in the first place.",1338508800,3,917,4.695652173913044

Despite some discouraging reviews here, I must say this BD is worth the upgrade from DVD! Image may not be perfect but it is fairly good. I have checked BD against the DVD and it really is a BIG step up picturewise!
This BD release shouldn't be blamed for the very few limitations that the source material had. It's interesting to hear what George Lucas had to say in his video commentaries (= GLvc) on this.
I'm sure American Graffiti has never looked better in home theaters. Enjoy!

When it comes to picture quality one has to keep in mind that
- the film was shot in 'Techniscope' (i.e. 2 perforation holes instead of 4, as in 'Cinemascope') hence cutting stock costs in half - unfortunately same goes for picture resolution. Therefore a slightly lesser picture quality than in usual Cinemascope Blu-ray transfers is the result. (GLvc TC 00:14:40)
- shot mostly with 'available light' camera operators had difficulty staying in focus (-> 'depth of field') e.g. TC 00:02:05; 00:03:24-31; 00:12:15 (GLvc 00:11:28, 00:39:48)
- fortunately they kept the DNR mallet in the box and the transfer shows some decent healthy grain in very good images e.g. 00:10:52; 00:12:33; 00:14:47.
- unfortunately some edge enhancement is visible here and there (e.g. light reflections on chrome parts of vintage cars 00:38:14)

I always loved this movie and admired George Lucas' tenacity to pull this off against all odds! Every effort had been put into production design ('embossed' vs. 'painted Coke bottles' GLvc TC 01:01:54) to re-create this marvelous '62 time bubble - but they still got at least one (?) tiny detail wrong: The high school band's guitarist plays a blonde (?) Stratocaster with 'enlarged headstock'. This feature wasn't introduced on Strats until mid/late '65 after Leo Fender had sold his company to CBS.

3462889,2,B001AQMBDM,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 ""BLU RAY"" REISSUE ***

George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" is remembered (and quite rightly so) with great affection - a five-star masterpiece that's almost unique in its vision of growing up in 1962 America listening to music on the radio in your car, getting up to no good and generally enjoying the sheer blast of a 'boss' Saturday night on the town. It also has one of the most atmospheric and brilliantly woven-in soundtracks 'ever' - an MCA 2LP set released with the movie in August 1973 that the public adored and kept on buying for decades after (it peaked at Number 10). It's also forgotten now, but ""American Graffiti"" virtually kick-started the massive Rock'n'Roll revival of the early Seventies that saw every major label reissue R'n'B, Doo Wop and R'n'R LPs to beat the band - much to the delight of music fans. And who among us wouldn't have wanted to spend the night in the company of the awesome Wolfman Jack (dialogue above).

I say all of this as a preamble, because I have no beef with the movie or what surrounds it. BUT - I have very real misgivings about the quality of the print on this 2011 BLU RAY reissue (hence the 2-star rating). It's not great at all, and in places, it's truly awful.

The opening Universal Logo looks ancient and scratched to bits, but as the movie credits begin to roll the picture-quality looks more promising if not a little blurry. You also see that we're in the early part of an evening still bathed in fading daylight, but as the movie quickly progresses, every shot becomes a night time scene - and the blocking and terrible grain of the original print just gets worse and worse. It's infuriating, because one moment the print quality is lovely - full of colour and depth - the next it's like a bad videotape - grainy to a point where the fuzzy picture is 'all' you see. The real bad news is that as the movie progresses to the Harrison Ford/Paul Le Mat car race showdown - there are scenes where the print is appalling - as bad as ""The French Connection"" (and anyone who has bought that turkey of a Blu Ray will know what I mean).

This is how Lucas filmed it I know - but the point is that this BLU RAY affords you a better picture only in 'certain' places - but for the majority of the time it gives you an accentuated version of wildly haphazard cinematography - and it makes for a very disappointing watch indeed. The DVD was always 'good' rather than great, but this 2011 BLU RAY is not a 'full on' upgrade as some have suggested - nor does it have the beautifully cleaned-up and restored stills that are suddenly peppering the net at the time of release. Anybody claiming this is a GLORIOUS transfer is talking absolute knob.

Fans may be unable to resist replacing their beloved DVD with this - fair enough - but anyone else considering buying it - I would advise a rental first to 'see' what I mean.

I hate doing negative reviews, but sometimes you need to. I wish someone had told me how bad this looked 'before' I wasted my money on it and had to sit through one of my favourite Seventies movies looking worse rather than better.

I have a copy of this film on VHS, Laser Disc, and the most recent Collector's Edition DVD. This newly restored Blu-ray has the best looking picture, yet! Whoever did the restoration and transfer made the film look like it was shot yesterday! The sound (which drives the storyline) is still in 2-channel stero, but it is in DTS. I remember seeing this movie shortly after I was discharged from the military in 1974 and I remembered how great the soundtract was, blaring out at appropriate times and becoming a surrounding echo on the occasions when the cruise scenes were shot and everyone on the strip had their car radios tuned to the exact same channel that the Wolfman Jack Show was on.

I am ( unfortunately ?) old enough to remember what this film looked like during its original theatrical release. It didn't look that much better than this Blu-Ray.
I have always loved this period-perfect nostalgia piece & having experienced this era for myself I can attest to its general veracity. I have seen a number of reviews critical of this transfer, but having owned the VHS & DVD versions rest assured that American Graffiti has never looked better. Yes there is slight edge-enhancement if you really look for it & a bit of Black Crush in the darkest scenes & occasional depth-of-field limitations here & there,but the majority,I'm convinced, is due to source limitations.
I suppose that a hurculean effort by an entity like Criterion might be able to improve on this transfer,but only marginally.
If you love this little gem of a movie like I do, you can buy this with the confidence that it is about as good as this movie is ever likely to look & sound.",1307750400,9,992,4.674285714285714
3462893,5,B001AQMBDM,"The Movie

He had real promise.  American Graffiti is the finest high school hang out movie of them all.  There are several career making, and even career defining performances from the broad ensemble.  Charles Martin Smith's ""Toad"" is my favorite.  Blink and you'll miss Han Solo driving a fire spitting Chevy.  There is something truly authentic about the experience here that, even though it is peppered with classic detroit iron from days long past, it feels timeless to me.  American Graffiti is a movie that showed the real promise of young director George Lucas, only for his career to be squandered by the drive to live off stuffed Ewoks and licensed toys.  What could have been George?

E Tu Jar Jar?

The Blu Ray

Overall, it's a pretty clean presentation, with some soft shots with the opening credit opticals and some of the longer lens shots.  There is a tad bit of noise reduction visible from the grain pattern but nothing really bad.  This was a low budge job in every way other than getting all those classic cars on the streets so the film stock probably wasn't the best you could pick up off the Kodak or Fuji shelf at the time.  In addition, the movie was shot on the Italian Techniscope format which uses half the 35mm negative area of a traditional film exposure.  You can't recover detail that isn't there - you only get grain, which explains why they used noise reduction.  It ain't a poster child for 1080p, but it's consistent and only the sound seems as if it could have been pumped up a bit.  There's no magic bullet to make this one look any better than it is.

The blu-ray  3/5",1307491200,9,1622,4.527586206896552

I even owned a white 1958 Chevy Impala like Steve's. What I was looking for was improved HD video crispness (that did happen) and improved sound for all of that wonderful old music. No dice. I have an excellent home theater setup which handles BluRay discs with surround sound in Dolby TruHD and DTS Master Audio with great aplomb. A state of the art BluRay disc has wonderful sound! Not the case here. The sound was sort of muffled, voices not clear, and when volume raised enough to hear the voices the music was too loud, etc. Certainly not modern BluRay disc standard. Really no better than my 2005 DVD version of this movie. Yes, the visuals were marginally better, but the sound really does not do justice to this great old classic.

3462895,5,B001AQMBDM,"Comment: When I first saw this movie (back in the day and before I knew the background of it) I thought that it had been filmed in a Canadian town in Ontario called London. When I lived there, 886 Adelaide Street (again, way back in the day) we had a drive-in restaurant called El Patio, shaped in a circle that very closely resembled the atmosphere shown in the film. We cruised the strip called Dundass Street (past the Simpson's store) in my 1953 Green Dodge (my first car later to be replaced by a 1959 Red and White Oldsmobile, like the one in the movie shown at Mel's Drive-in) I was dating a girl named ""Kelly"" (she went on to have a ""teams worth"" of kids with another guy I nicknamed ""Quicksilver""... after I moved to California and went into the Marine Corps to fight in Vietnam... ""Another American Graffiti"") I used to spend a lot of time at a place called Fanshaw Dam (""making out"") so I got tagged with the nickname ""Fanshaw"" (which I guess I didn't mind that much) I worked at a place named London Motor Products where we got hold of the ""new 409 Pontiac"" that we raced at ""Green Acres Drag Strip"" (More American Graffiti). Well as you can guess, I just love this movie (I wish I could say the same about More American Graffiti). There must be so many of us with similar stories. We had no problem getting ""The Wolf Man"" in the night as we cruised. (""AM atmospheric skip"") We also had a High-School jock that was killed when he wrapped his car around a tree.
