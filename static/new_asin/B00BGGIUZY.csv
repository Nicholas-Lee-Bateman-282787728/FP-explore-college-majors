5616490,3,B00BGGIUZY,"So disappointed - color washed out - watched this on HBO not too long ago, their version the color was fabulous, the sound was excellent and it was also in HD. Why is 20th being so cheap, when they have some of the best films in their vaults with biggest stars of their time and prime. Is it because they're now owned by the NEWS CORP. who really don't care how things look as long as they can make a buck. Shame on you - go back to vaults and restore these great movies the way they should be seen. It's never an old movie when it looks brand new. Yours is the only studio that does this ripoff. Get with it - you'll sell a lot more of these films if you restore them. The public is not stupid, they'll catch on and these films won't sell. Get with it 20th.",1368403200,5,758,3.9934210526315788
5616491,4,B00BGGIUZY,"It's a Betty Grable musical, so expect beautiful costumes, color reproduction and a cute story.  However, it is a very similar story line as Cony Island.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the musicals we used to enjoy seeing even if it is a little familiar, it's worth seeing.",1366156800,,279,4.56
5616492,3,B00BGGIUZY,"Following a couple of box-office disappointments (""That Lady in Ermine"", ""The Shocking Miss Pilgrim,"" and ""The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend"") 20th rushed Betty Grable into the musical remake of one of her biggest hits ""Coney Island.""  It's entertaining (mainly because of Grable's singing and dancing) but comes nowhere near the crackle and fun of the 1943 film.  The DVD of ""Coney Island"" is an excellent, restored print (probably due to it's presentation at the TCM Film Festival a few years back) not because 20th went out of their way.  Added to this, the  print of ""Wabash Avenue"" is uneven, dark, murky and obviously from the Fox Channel vaults.  When Betty sings ""I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"" in Technicolor it jumps off the screen.  In this DVD it's dark and does an injustice to  the star.  The production numbers are okay (particularly the Academy Award nominated ""Wilhelmina"") but the rest are ordinary, seem rushed and come nowhere near the production values of ""Coney Island.""  I adore Betty Grable and was lucky to have seen most of her major films in Technicolor on initial release.  I don't hate ""Wabash Avenue"" but this DVD does little for the fan or the viewer.  Technicolor was very important to the popularity of Betty Grable.  When it's not used it affects lighting, color. make-up and is an insult to the extensive color-costume tests the studio made to insure that stars like Betty Grable, Alice Faye, Carmen Miranda, June Haver, Vivian Blaine (and even non-musical stars like Jeanne Crain and Linda Darnell (""State Fair,"" ""Centennial Summer"") were seen in the 40's Fox musicals to full advantage.",1364256000,7,1640,4.945255474452555
5616493,3,B00BGGIUZY,"Much has been said about this film being a remake of Coney Island so it's not worth repeating again.  But, what I will say is that neither Coney Island nor Wabash Avenue have ever been previously available on DVD or VHS so just to even be able to buy it is okay by me. I've had a CD for many years that has the songs from this film on it; I just have never seen the film. It's nice to hear the songs in the context of the film now!

Wabash Avenue is part of the Fox Cinema Archives collection - no chapters, no fancy packaging, no extras, no subtitles. Nothing but the movie itself. Honestly, I think Betty Grable deserves better packaging but at least this is something and better than nothing.

Okay, Fox, now that you've proved that there's a market for these films, how about Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe, When My Baby Smiles At Me, Call Me Mister and (most of all) Tin Pan Alley (hey, at least it's available on VHS)?",1363996800,3,924,4.268571428571429
5616494,4,B00BGGIUZY,"Of the two films CONEY ISLAND and its remake WABASH AVENUE, I found the original to be the best.  I am not a fan of Phil Harris who I found to be a bit obnoxious with his smirky, toothy smile. No fault with Grable who is sparkling as usual.  Unlike CONEY ISLAND, this MOD film released by FOX is not a satisfying print.  This film tends to look too orangey or reddish at times.  Other times it looks beautiful. FOX either does not care or is just too sloppy the way they are bringng these films out on DVD. I am hoping FOX will release another Grable film MEET ME AFTER THE SHOW.",1363392000,5,579,4.097345132743363
5616495,5,B00BGGIUZY,"Wabash Avenue (1950) is an excellent remake of Betty Grable's
Coney Island (1943) and the good news is the Grable stars
in both Technicolor musicals. The story is pretty much the same,
but the cast and the songs have been changed. This time around,
Victor Mature, Phil Harris, James Barton and Reginald Gardiner co-star.
Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch from Oz) is fun is a small role.

The songs include: Down On Wabash Avenue, Billy, Honey Man,
I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate, Are You From Dixie?,
Baby Won't You Say You Love Me?, May I Tempt You With A Big Red
Rosy Apple, I've Been Floating Down The Old Green River,
Wilhelmina and many more.

I think Coney Island and Wabash Avenue would make a great
double feature. You'd be surprised how different they are in many
ways, but both very enjoyable.",1362873600,4,817,4.589041095890411
5616496,5,B00BGGIUZY,"Wabash Avenue is an exception; when the remake is as good as the original.  Betty Grable first filmed the story as the 1943 release Coney Island.  For Wabash Avenue the location is moved to Chicago; new songs and dances are added; with a few changes to the storyline to create a sparkling, fresh entertainment.

Grable has fun with the character of Ruby Summers, who is arguably more feisty than her Kate Farley in Coney Island.  Her wishing to shimmy like her sister Kate number is a wow.",1362873600,9,489,4.586206896551724
5616497,4,B00BGGIUZY,"It is all Grable and it's a good remake of her ""Coney Island"" with some new songs and Betty's 'Shimmy Like my Sister Kate' show-stopper. And Victor Mature and Phil Harris hold their own. It is entertaining, fun and colorful. However, a lot of the scenes have more 'red"" than should be. I guess this is the best print that Fox could get.",1362700800,4,336,4.349206349206349
5616498,5,B00BGGIUZY,"All though is the same story as Coney Island, It is a great movie. The story is the same, but different actors. I enjoyed it none the less. I will watch it again and again. Betty is so cool. she just vibrates fun and lots of love for what she does. Don't miss one. Oh yes, different songs.",1362614400,4,289,4.0
5616499,5,B00BGGIUZY,"Today (6 March 2013) my copy of ""Wabash Avenue"" arrived!  This is part of the FOX ARCHIEVES series that some have
complained about.  This film is lovely.  The print is great and ANY film that opens with Betty singing ""I Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"" while wearing a gold fringe outfit.....is bound to be delightful and pleasing.  Betty is still easiy at her peak here AND gets to play a girl who comes up through saloons to become a top entertainer.  It is a positively winning combination, If you love Betty or just think you might like Betty..this film will thrill  you.  Do not miss this chance to own a copy...so far as I
know this film has not  been  previously released.  If you have other GRABLE favorites....keep your eyes open, as a number
of Betty's flms are popping up and it is a treat to be able to have them in good studio copies to enjoy.",1362528000,23,869,4.341614906832298

5616504,5,B00BGGIUZY,"Wabash Avenue is a must-have for any Betty Grable fan..A cute movie , this is the one where she sings ""I Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"". Well worth the time to watch.",1402963200,,181,4.055555555555555
5616505,2,B00BGGIUZY,"Fox's earlier releases of Down Argentine Way, Moon Over Miami and other Grable movies were obviously made directly from the studio's masters, whereas the more recent ones like Wabash Avenue obviously were not (as other customer reviews make clear). The unacceptable color should be an embarrassment to Fox but the people now in charge there obviously don't give a damn.

As do lifelong appreciators like me who have made major contributions to Fox's profitability over the years.

Granted, movies of this vintage, especially musicals, are a niche market in the eyes of the studio's present management, but doesn't it owe something at least on the qualitative scale to the star who kept Fox stay profitable in the years of her record tenure as No. 1 at the box office, as well as to her millions of fans who still expect the best from the re-release of her cherished  movies?

I urge Fox to make Wabash Avenue and the other titles not transferred from original 3-Strip Technicolor available on current state-of-the-art Blue Ray.

The best deserves the best, and Betty Grable was the timeless best at everything she ever did!
