2925837,5,B000UVV274,"Viewing Sterlin Harjo's ""Barking Water"" this summer @ Santa Fe's Native Cinema Showcase, I wanted more. An earlier movie made on location in familiar territory -- Wewoka (aka Barking Water), Holdenville, and Tulsa, Ok. -- ""Four Sheets to the Wind"" more than suffices.
Here a younger generation of Seminole comes to terms -- and not -- with death in the family and the need to explore beyong their rural round. Loved the folk tales, interspersed spoken Seminole language (Cufe=rabbit), sly sense of humor, extraordinary NA casting -- and yes, being Home.

2925838,1,B000UVV274,"This movie had a great promo, but did not deliver what it promised. It did not successfully get to the point, although it tried for way too long.",1225411200,4,145,4.214285714285714
2925839,4,B000UVV274,"Pleasantly surprised with this film by Sterlin Harjo, I caught the tail end of this movie on the Sundance Channel one day and was immediately drawn to it by its narrative in Muscogee (Seminole?) language. I finally got a hold of the DVD and watched the entire movie.  I wasn't too sure about watching this movie on Mother's Day because of some of its initial scenes.  But in the end, it was a perfect movie for that day.
I think it is hard sometimes to make American Indian movies in contemporary settings without being sore about modern Indian social conditions such as alcoholism and racism.  Sometimes such films start out only pointing to those issues and then next thing you know it's like we are yelling at or preaching to viewers.
This movie along with such films like Pow Wow Highway, Doe Boy, and Dance Me Outside recognize the sociocultural aspects of Native America but mostly emphasize modern American Indian storytelling by portraying traditional beliefs methaphorically.  In any case, it is a movie about death, awakening, salvation, and rebirth.  Four elements to the wind.
For this film, we see the portraits of contemporary living through Cufe, his mother, and his sister in Oklahoma.  Yet through, the deceased father's 3rd person narrative, he tells us of the ongoings as if it was a Muscogee traditional folktale. Very neat and very original.
Cody Lightning is excellent as Cufe.  But, Tamara Podemski gives the breakout performance of her career.
I give this movie only 4 stars even though it deserves 5.  But, it is Four Sheets to the Wind.  Get it?",1213228800,17,1571,4.832089552238806
2925840,5,B000UVV274,A wonderful film.  I loved every minute of it.  The actors were great.  Cody Lightning was brilliant. The entire cast fit their roles perfectly.  Sterlin Harjo [writer and director of the film] was amazing.  The story was beautiful.  I have viewed the film three times and will watch it again and again.,1199232000,10,303,4.730769230769231
2925841,5,B000UVV274,Four Sheets was one of the highlights of Sundance '07 and has captivated audiences at every theatrical festival stop along the way.  A must see... a beautiful tale exploring the human condition.,1193443200,6,194,5.0625
2925842,5,B000UVV274,"""Four Sheets to the Wind"" premiered at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival in 2007 where it was greeted with a standing ovation.  Though not commercial fare, the film is one of the best surprises of the year.  Cody Lightning stars as a young native american who decided to leave his Oklahoma reservation for city life in Tulsa.  There he meets up with his troubled sister.  The relationship between the two is at the heart of this beautiful film.  The lead performances are near perfect and was singled out for recognition during the festival awards ceremony.  Don't miss this inspiring and dramatic story!",1193097600,44,609,4.921568627450981

2925858,1,B000UVV274,This story line was very weak and the movie was mostly boring. I wish it had been better the subject a good one but not developed very well,1360195200,,139,4.0
2925859,1,B000UVV274,"When reading the reviews I was initially pleased with the first couple I read and didn't read any further. After all, I placed in the search engine a search for family friendly, Christian, Inspirational movies to watch. This movie is under that catagory. While it's only rated PG-13 we were shocked by the very crude language and it went downhill from there. Once the scene of incest (brother sleeps with sister) began we turned this video off and requested an immediate refund for falsely leading us to believe this movie was ""inspirational"". I would not watch this movie with any of my family members, my friends, my adult children and especially my grandchildren! This is inspirational??? We've certainly declined in our rating system and our ideas of what ""inspirational"" means. We intentionally watch and seek out films that are light on vulgarity and certainly where morality and the character of mankind is defined by anyone of any faith in God. The fact that we are Christian made this film even harder to watch. We simply could not watch any longer and had it deleted. Parents, beware: THIS IS NOT AN INSPIRATIONAL MOVIE BY THE STANDARDS WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FOR FAMILY-FRIENDLY VIEWING.",1350432000,2,1198,4.906403940886699
2925860,5,B000UVV274,"I found this story of young Oklahoma Indians absorbing in the way any story is about young people finding themselves in a world that doesn't offer much of a place for them to fit in. Cufe, the central character is wonderfully played by Cody Lightning, who gives a thoughtful, quiet performance as a young man on the cusp of learning who and what he is. The death of his father awakens him to his real isolation in the world, and through him we understand his sister's desperate lostness as her life finds a dead end, off the reservation in Tulsa.

This is a movie about sons, as most of the screen time belongs to Cufe, especially as he opens up to a young woman he befriends while visiting his sister in the city and talks of his grief for his dead father. It is also a movie about motherhood and the pain and fear to be seen in the wonderful performance of Jeri Arredondo as Cufe and Miri's mother. While the film has more than the usual level of emotion, it avoids sentimentality and easy resolutions. It also has moments of wry humor, especially at the opening when the family has to fake a funeral for a man whose body has already been disposed of. Whites in the film, for a change, are stereotyped for their well-meaning foolishness on the one hand and coarse insensitivity on the other. This is a fine film with a Native American voice, and I look forward to more from director Sterlin Harjo.",1276128000,11,1399,4.422480620155039
2925861,5,B000UVV274,I have played the movie several times just to hear the narrator.  The characters were all easy to relate to and the plot was realistic.  I thought it was a good movie- and so has other people that have viewed it with me.  I would replace the movie with another one if I lost it...  that says something...,1264377600,4,304,4.189655172413793
2925862,5,B000UVV274,"I have purchased several copies of this movie and sent to friends around the globe because Harjo's perspective is so unique and telling to the Oklahoma Native American experience.  When a voice and vision is as original and entertaining as Harjo something wonderful happens for the viewer.  I am not a professional movie reviewer, and do not review movies, but this is a must see.",1264291200,,380,4.8307692307692305

8215183,2,B000UVV274,"The opening scene has Cuffy dragging his dad's body to a little pond and supposedly sinking it with two brick tied around the neck, soaking himself to the shoulders, then getting out, taking a dry pack of cigs from his wet hoodie pocket and lighting up.  Ok, but it doesn't get better.

  The white characters near the family home are shown to be imbeciles, but Cuffy and Miri still end up in bed with their white friends in Tulsa.  I don't know what Harjo meant with this film.  Maybe he's trying to make sure everyone thinks that films by NDNs aren't worth watching.  Give this one a miss.  I wish I had.",1458432000,,606,4.348214285714286
