2814843,5,B000PAAK64,"It's been so long since I read the play that I can't compare this production, which another reviewer called ""truncated,"" to the original.  This is short but the collection of some of the finest actors in England plus Ingrid Bergman in her prime, make this a powerful performance. Ms. Bergman dominates every scene with her amazing presence.  I had forgotten what a great actress she was.  And, she is absolutely beautiful here.  We are fortunate to have this on record.",1189036800,38,469,4.825
2814844,4,B000PAAK64,"This truncated adaptation of one of Ibsen's masterpieces does less than full justice to the elegant, classical dramatic architecture that distinguishes the craftsmanship of the original text. Moreover, as if to add insult to injury, additional scenes and new dialogue of matter merely narrated in the original are added here as unnecessary filler. For this reason, the production deserves less than 5 stars.

These limitations having been pointed out, what is nevertheless remarkable is the undeniable success of the extraordinary cast assembled here in conveying within a mere 75 minutes the essence of Ibsen's drama. Michael Redgrave, for instance, as the bumbling, foolish George Tesman is a scholar in the mode Nietzsche parodied and Ibsen similarly saw the folly of. Tesman is the sort of 19th century academic new man who believes one approaches a better conception of the real and the important by peering ever more closely at the domestic industries of Brabant in the Middle Ages. At the same time, inattentive to what's going on before his eyes, he's spectacularly unfit as a husband or a colleague. Ralph Richardson, in the reduced number of lines that remain to him, is a singularly reptilian, sophisticated Judge Brack, a true rival in at first witty and then sinister repartee to the aristocrat who's come down in the world, Hedda Gabler.

Ibsen once said that modern man is ""a neurotic sufferer,"" and the principal exponent of such a conception of dramatic character here is, of course, Hedda herself. Ingrid Bergman plays this very character to the hilt. Spoiled, witty, above all bored to tears, she is cunning, manipulative, and finally at her wit's end. Great facial acting and caustic wit distinguish Bergman's Hedda. Her face is a book in which the audience, if not always the other characters, may read her thoughts. And she brings out the humor that is always in Ibsen. Her performance, even  in truncated form, is in itself worth 6 stars.",1186272000,34,1961,5.046296296296297

2814854,5,B000PAAK64,"If you appreciate the works of Henrik Ibsen , you will certainely enjoy this BBC's production of this tragic masterpiece.  Ingrid Bergman who plays Hedda steals the show as always.  She is the greatest actress of all time; of course, my opinion.  Back from her honeymoon after marrying an older rather dull academic man, she tries to keep herself from becoming the typical married lady.  She unfortunately was born in the wrong century.  However, her life becomes  more intrigueing T when her x-lover enters the stage & threatens to ruin her sedate life.  The ending is quite a shocking surprise. This dramatic play is not for all.",1243728000,4,631,4.841121495327103
2814855,5,B000PAAK64,"Much as I hate to admit it, the insufferable Stanley N has said most of what I planned to say about this cinema adaptation of Ibsen's most popular drama. Yes, Ingrid Bergman is exquisite on screen, her close-ups being worth at least the few hundred words that have been cut from the script. Yes, the rest of the cast is worthy of sharing the screen with her. Yes, this would be a powerful psychological film even if it had somehow been crafted by Hollywood hacks. One thing Mr. N fails to mention is the visual beauty of the film, all the action being contained within the parlor and the porch of the Gabler mansion as if on a stage, yet with very fluid camera work worthy of that other Swede named Bergman.

This film is available as part of the six-DVD, ten production Ibsen Collection from the BBC, which I've been carrying in my suitcase while on the road for a month. So far I've watched three plays: this Hedda Gabler made in 1963, An Enemy of the People, and Little Eyolf.

""Enemy"" has been curiously adapted, relocated in Scotland several decades later in time than the original; it's an intellectually shallow interpretation but a fairly strong piece of cinema on its own, well acted and directed.

""Little Eyolf"" is utterly faithful to the mood and content of Ibsen's drama; starring Anthony Hopkins and Diana Riggs, it has none of the stilted wordiness of Ibsen translations on stage even though it delivers the whole script without noticeable cuts. Again the visuals are evocative, graceful, and fluid. How I'd love to see the movie industry re-learn the art of editing more than five-second cuts!

The filmed plays also include: Brand, A Doll's House, Ghosts, The Wild Duck, The Lady from the Sea, and The Master Builder. Eight radio plays are appended to various DVDs, but I haven't yet tried to listen to them.

I heartily recommend this single film, but I urge everyone to consider the whole BBC collection. The dramas of Henryk Ibsen are not mere museum pieces. Though I hope films never completely replace stage productions, these films are good enough to bring Ibsen to life for home of hotel viewers.",1231977600,7,2120,4.688172043010753

8190097,4,B000PAAK64,"This is a great cast, and all of them do a great job. This is the first time I saw Hedda Gabler, so I can't comment whether this is truncated or not. All I know is that this is great drama. There is great insight into character and into the world of Henrik Ibsen.

Ingrid Bergman is the manipulative but unfortunate Hedda Gabler. Hedda Gabler's character is complex, subject to several interpretations. You will have to watch the film or read the play, and come to your own conclusions. Bergman's facial expressions and beauty in this movie are amazing.

Michael Redgrave is the bumbling and naive academic George Tesman who somehow ends up married to Hedda, as her options for the future narrow. He little understands Hedda's complex inner nature. He spends much of the time on his honeymoon in his obscure research concerning household industries from Brabant of centuries past. Unaware of all the scheming and sub-plots going on in his household, he blithely moves forward with his vacuous academic pursuits.

Ralph Richardson is very convincing as the diabolical Judge Brack, in love with Hedda and scheming to have his desires fulfilled. While George is in the kitchen just yards away in conversation concerning his obscure research, Judge Brack casts his wiles to entangle Hedda.

Two less important characters round out the play. Eilert Lovborg is an academic rival of George and former lover of Hedda, whose appearance in the play sets events into motion. Thea Elvsted is the insecure, unhappily married former classmate of Hedda's, who has inspired Lovborg to stop drinking and write a masterpiece. Hedda seems to easily manipulate both Eilert and Thea, and even destroys Eilert's manuscript. But in the end Thea more or less wins, as George and Thea plan to spend the indefinite future reconstructing Eilert's manuscript, and Hedda is relegated to the company of the sinister Judge Brack.

The only reason I took off one star is because this is a television production. You can tell the difference, with some of the camera work, and with some scenes that I think would have been retaken for a movie. However, I will watch this again in the future. For the performances of Ingrid Bergman and Ralph Richardson, this is not to be missed.",1392595200,3,2244,4.894736842105263
8190098,5,B000PAAK64,"I bought this DVD set to use with my high school seniors instead of watching the version available on YouTube. It is a good quality production, and even though Ingrid Bergman may be a tad bit old for the role she does a great job of conveying just how terrible Hedda really is. Her performance manages to keep the attention of (most of) my teenaged students, and that's saying something. As far as visual value, the director took careful consideration to arrange the sets according to Henrik Ibsen's original detailed descriptions, so the old house is compelling.",1383696000,,563,4.814432989690721
