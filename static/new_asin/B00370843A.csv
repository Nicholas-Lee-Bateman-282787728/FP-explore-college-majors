4080030,5,B00370843A,"The film ""The Last Station"" focuses on the last few months of the novelist and writer Leo Tolstoy's family and social life.  It stars Christopher Plummer as Tolstoy, Helen Mirren as his wife Sophya, James McAvoy as Tolstoy's new personal secretary Valentin, Kerry Condon as Valentin's charming and aggressive love interest, and Paul Giamatti as the leader of a group of ""Tolstoyans"" who wish to widely promote Tolstoy's ideals.

The film is set in early 20th century Russia, before the harsh realities of the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917 and thereafter (Tolstoy died in 1910).  It was a time in history when Socialism was still an untried idealized conceptual form of government, and Tolstoy in his final years became more ""radical"" in his political, religious, and social philosophies.

The film raises 2 universal questions:  1)  What do you do when the love of your life is in conflict with your highest priority ideals? And how does your treatment or mistreatment of the people closest to you, who have loved and cared for you the most, reflect on the quality of your ideals?

~Spoilers Ahead ~

In the final months of Tolstoy's life, he abandoned his wife of 48 years, Sophya.  Before Sophya and Leo married, Sophya knew of his many sexual escapades he shared with her in his diaries.  She knew he had fathered a child with one of the servant girls in his household.  Nevertheless, she loved him and married him, giving him 13 children, 5 of whom died in childhood.  The movie implies the question:  At what point does your life become more than a solitary pursuit?  After how many years of good treatment and co-dependence with those close to you does your life necessarily and deservedly become considerate of more than just your own priorities?  Where should your deference be?

In 2009, it was widely reported that a British couple, both 98 years old, divorced.  When a friend of mine heard of the story, she said, ""What was the point?""  It's a fascinating question.  When do we ever stop wanting to define ourselves, our relationships, and our boundaries?

James McAvoy's character Valentin is a young, romantic idealist who wishes to promote Tolstoy's ideals.  He runs into a young woman named Masha, who is less interested in layers of idealism, moral laws, and controls, and is more interested in physical and emotional feelings and connections.  She quickly disarms his protests by being sexually aggressive with him.  His ideals lose some of their zeal and absolutism when confronted with Masha's ability to naturally please him.

The film parallels Valentin's young love story with Tolstoy's love story with Sophya.  Valentin is given a rare view, at a young age, to watch ""ideals"" clash with ""love.""  Valentin, living in the house with Tolstoy, is able to watch a ""great man"" who is leading a ""revolutionary"" movement.  He's able to watch how Tolstoy's focus on ""the greater good"" appears to harm and betray his wife, whose ideals are in conflict with his.

The film implies that Sophya did more than cleaning house and raising children while Tolstoy wrote.  She tempered his novels' dialogues and added exceptional advice to his female portrayals.  She transcribed and edited his major novels.  She was not simply his wife, she was a co-creator of his greatest artworks.

The film is based on a 1990 novel ""The Last Station"" by Jay Parini.  The title refers to many things, including the fact that Tolstoy died at a train station, fleeing his wife and estate.  The title also implies the question:  How will your actions in the last station of your life define your legacy?  What will your last station leave behind for your immediate social circle and your community in general?

The screenplay is tight, moving, and never circuitous.  The direction is solid and never distracting.  The actors are excellent.  I've heard the most praise for Mirren and McAvoy, but I found Plummer's and Condon's performances to be equally excellent.  Plummer is in top form, less affected than in his younger roles.  The film is a perfect length and the roles are not drawn as too overwrought or too ""good"" vs. ""evil.""  We see the conflicting ideals of each of the main characters and we can easily understand the warfare that develops when their strong boundaries don't wish to co-exist.

I was hesitant to give this film a ""number of stars"" rating.  But I appreciate it when other reviewers place some measurable rating on the films they review.  When trying to come up with a correct number, I asked myself:  ""What was wrong with this film?""  And I couldn't think of anything.

It's difficult for viewers to leave this film feeling good.  This is not a film with a ""feel good"" ending.  It's a real story about complex people who in the end desperately didn't want the same things.  There are no clear winners in the final act of Tolstoy's life's story.  But over time, I'm glad the work of his whole life has shined brighter and more prominently than his final chapter.",1266624000,183,4981,4.840047393364929

4080051,5,B00370843A,"The Last Station examines the last year of Leo Tolstoy's life. Portrayed convincingly by Christopher Plummer, the film reflects the shift in cultural currents and hints at the profound political upheaval Russia will endure not many years later. Helen Mirren is brilliant as Tolstoy's tempestuous, but devoted, wife Sofya, and Paul Giamatti is perfect as the zealous and calculating ""true believer"" who is more than capable of ruthlessness to preserve a social experiment and create a myth, even if that means denying his dying hero what he wants most, his beloved Sofya. James McAvoy captures the innocence of idealistic and inexperienced youth as Tolstoy's latest secretary. He enters the lives of Leo and Sofya as a young man devoted to theory and principles and leaves as a wiser young man who appreciates the things Tolstoy valued, such as the simple joy of being alive and, above all, love. This is a film that admirers of ""War and Peace"" and ""Anna Karenina"" will likely appreciate. I know I did.",1445212800,3,1001,4.964285714285714

The entirely superfluous love interest between McAvoy and Condon is a silly distraction. But much more importantly, like ""Walk the Line"" (although that was a much better movie than this one), it doesn't really try to get into the soul of the man.

4080075,4,B00370843A,"In the last two decades of his life - the author of ""War And Peace"" and ""Anna Karenina"" - wasn't just the most famous writer in the world - Leo Tolstoy was the inspiration for an entire movement that advocated pacifism, vegetarianism and love as the core of its commune philosophy. Tolstoy also rejected Church dictate, private property and was even seen by some as a living saint. And in 1919 his fame was such that he actually became one of the world's first modern-day celebrities - filmed on Pathe Cameras everywhere he went - with crews and press teams relentlessly stalking his home for photos and footage of the great man. And although he neither sought out publicity nor was comfortable with it - his ego as Demigod enjoyed it too - putting huge pressure of his home life and volatile marriage.

The statistics surrounding the lifelong union of Leo and Sofya Tolstoy are incredible (played to perfection by Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren). Married when she was 18, she bore him 13 children and they were still sexually passionate into their 80s. But forces like the leader of the worldwide Tolstoyan movement Vladamir Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), his devoted Doctor Dushan (John Sessions) and even his daughter Sasha (Anne-Marie Duff) all wanted him to give his legacy to posterity. This effectively meant forfeiting the copyright to his written works - giving the lot to the people and not his family.

Seeing how her ageing husband was being flattered for political ends while her family's fortune was being simultaneously shafted - Countess Sofya thought otherwise - battling constantly with him and his army of devoted followers. After all - she had hand-written ""War And Peace"" six times for him - spent her entire life devoted to the man - only at the end to see his life's accomplishments be used by reformist zealots (""They read him but they don't understand a word..."").

Entering into this cauldron of personal warfare and political intrigue comes a young virginal Moscow idealist of 26 - Valentin Bulgakov (James McAvoy) - who becomes Tolstoy's Private Secretary for the last year of his life. Valentin's stay at the Tolstoy Estate of Yasnaya Polyana and the nearby Tolstoyan commune of Telyatinki introduces him to temper tantrums, ideological debate at garden parties, endless scribbling and even love in the shape of the feisty Masha (a fabulous turn by Irish Actress Kerry Condon - the jockey Rosie in the TV series ""Luck"" - her dialogue above titles this review). But soon Valentin is more than in love - he's conflicted. Should he keep on spying for the ruthless and obsessed Chertkov or should he leave the great man in peace. It all culminates in driving the old author into despair - until one day Tolstoy can take no more and leaves on a train. But ill health brings him to...

""The Last Station"" was adapted by Writer and Director Michael Hoffman from Jay Parini's 1989 novel of the same name (itself based on Valentin's diaries). With such a juicy story and a well-written script - big names and big talent were drawn to it.

But none of this would amount to naught if it weren't for the central story of their 'love' - the difficulty of living in it and the impossibility of doing without it. Mirren's Sofya is all spiky rage, steely determination and drama Queen swoons while Plummer's bearded Tolstoy looks benevolently on her - adoring his long-suffering wife one moment - repulsed by her need and annoyed by her courage the next. Both characters are big shoes to fill - and with fantastic word battles - they give utterly convincing performances of trapped people - giggling in young bedroom tenderness one night then spitting ideological venom at each other the following morning on the porch.

There are also fabulous conversations between Plummer and McAvoy as they walk on lilac-scented evenings about 'actual life' instead of philosophy and the scheming Giamatti character fills ever scene with a self-righteous knowing that he is so good at. Throw in acting heavyweights like John Sessions, Anne-Marie Duff, Kerry Condon and the spot-on James McAvoy (married in real life to Anne-Marie Duff) and you're in for an emotional ride as well as an engaging historical tale. This is sumptuous, well-crafted, intelligent filmmaking (and even funny too in places) and quite why either Mirren or Plummer didn't get Oscars for their lead roles is frankly a bit of a mystery...

Filmed in Germany with huge production values ""The Last Station"" is also a gorgeous watch on BLU RAY. Defaulted to 2.35:1 - there are bars top and bottom of the screen - but even stretching to Full Aspect - it's looks beautiful throughout - especially on close ups of clothes, steam trains and in the idyllic countryside communes.

One of the two Extras includes a truly superb 45-minute Making Of called ""Conversations On..."" which features extensive interviews with Director and Screenplay Writer Michael Hoffman, the original author Jay Parini, Producers Jens Meurer and Bonnie Arnold and all the leads (the work process, favourite scenes, discussion of Tolstoy and the period). There's even Anthony Quinn's agent who owned the book rights for decades (he had hoped to do the part). Audio is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and the Subtitle is English.

In the end it's a fascinating story - and an insight into the world of arguably the world's first global pop star - only with a beard, arteritis, a cranky wife and a troop of peasants in tow waving their cloth caps instead of their Dolce and Gabbana handbags.

A top job done by all (especially Michael Hoffman) - ""The Last Station"" is a movie journey well worth the huff and puff...",1396224000,,5644,4.869791666666667
4080076,4,B00370843A,"I was not aware that Tolstoy's last months were spent in a political movement that rejected all notions of private property.  This shows the family dynamics of such a large family perhaps losing what would be millions in publishing royalties.  It focuses on the obsessed cult leader who would literally be ignored without a well known celebrity propping him up.  It also spends a great deal of time on the loyal new assistant of Tolstoy, whose sympathies most often lie with the marginalized and demonized Mrs. Tolstoy.  This is an easy story to follow for those who know next to nothing about these figures.",1393286400,,608,4.8173076923076925

4080079,3,B00370843A,"Bottom line first: the Last Station consists of many good pieces. There's some wonderful acting some beautiful scenery a couple of ideas to kick around but there's not enough here to make a great movie or a particularly good entertainment. Opinion on this movie is sufficiently divided such that I'm going to recommend you rent it once before committing to buying your own copy.

The driving conflict central to this movie is the historical reenactment of the disagreement between a dying Count Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer) and his wife the Countess Sophia (Helen Mirren). The great author in fact had become something of a mystic and a socialist in his old age. He had been born to a certain amount of wealth and had added to it with his brilliant writing. But his philosophies were not the kind that insured wealth for his legitimate children. He would die before the Russian revolution and so never had to compare his ideals to the hermaphrodite communism that would subject more than two generations of Russians to what was called dictatorship of the proletariat but operated more like a dictatorship of the apparatchiks. Countess Sophia is of the aristocratic tradition deeply concerned with the practical problems of funding their aristocratic children. The immediate case of this philosophic this agreement was the Count's determination to sign over copyrights to all of his books to the people of Russia. The Countess was equally determined to ensure that the Tolstoy wealth would be preserved for the Tolstoy children.

Around at the central argument there are fleeting references to the Tolstoian's a more or less idealistic communalist group of youths who are attempting to build a village around their inspiration's philosophies. Within this group our attention is focused on Valentin (James McAvoy) and Masha(Kerry Condun). These two are supposed to represent, I suppose youthful ideology and the beauty of the human animal or something or another. Perhaps they are supposed to be in youth something of what Tolstoy and his various lovers were in his youth. Besides the fact that they are lovely young couple and engage in very healthy sex is not much reason for them to be in this movie at some point they do become observers of the larger plot and I suppose how they react to each other is supposed to be a lesson but if you haven't figured it out yet this is all very vague.

Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer perform their roles brilliantly a task slightly easier for them because their roles and purposes are more clearly defined. In fact the two female leads Helen Mirren and Kerry Condon portray strong-willed spirited women every bit the equal of the men in their lives. Given the vacillations of Valentin, Mesha is in control of their relationship.

 The movie was shot in Germany but succeeds in capturing something of the beauty of a remote Russian estate.

It is possible to list a number of aspects of this movie that are worthy of your time. These parts do not come together because at base the central conflict is talked out without by itself making up a full movie script. From the supporting cast there is good acting, from the writers some good writing. There are  good costumes.  All are kind of thrown in in an effort to turn this into a full length movie. I cannot say that I hate this movie. There's more to like than dislike but I'm not sure this is more than a ""one viewer"". The young lovers certainly give you something to at which to look. The dialogue gives you much to think about; but I'm not sure The Last Station ever comes together.",1375660800,,3585,4.808441558441558

4080083,5,B00370843A,"This wonderful movie chronicles the last chapter in Tolstoy's life, maintaining an accurate (in so far as one can tell) account of his family ties, his relations with his followers, and the impressions of his personal secretary, who becomes the narrator of this tale. All of the main characters are real people, except for Masha, who was invented for the film. The cinematography is well done, beautiful (although Germany was substituted for mother Russia in most of the scenes), and competent in most aspects. Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer do a magnificent job in their starring roles. Bart Giammati is excellent as usual. James McEvoy does an admirable job as the young star-struck personal secretary, a man who has the instincts to do the right thing, but lacks courage and conviction.

The central question of Tolstoy's last days is the question of loyalty. Should the great man be loyal to his family, or to his followers? He was the most celebrated novelist in Russia, but gradually the Tolstoyan movement, with the trappings of a cult, overtook his fading efforts as a writer. It would help your understanding of the film to have some familiarity with his writing and his philosophy. He found it difficult to withstand the blandishments of followers who revered him as a prophet, even if they did show an indecent interest in his estate. And his wife of many years was a drama queen, someone who embarrassed him, but could he just discard her? Where did his loyalty lie? Are you free to choose, and will you suffer damnation for making the wrong choice? The movie does not explore that question at length, although Tolstoy himself was deeply involved with it. He never understood God's grace, and never ceased to apply a severe standard of judgment against himself.

This is not a happy movie, but it is still a good one. I am glad that I watched it. Most movies produced today are a waste of time, and many are an abomination. This is an exception.

4080086,5,B00370843A,"What a beautiful, appealing film is the Last Station. Even if it takes placed during th final months of the celebrated author Leo Tolstoy's life, it is really about life and its complexities and choices and options.  The scenes of the Russian countryside are beautiful and certainly explain why Tolstoy would opt for the pure country life in his later years. The acting is perfect with Helen Mirren and James McAvoy delivering wonderful performances. The film is about complexity also. Life offers complexity and this film does a superb job of revealing the conflicting nature of our desires and personal philosophy. Leo Tolstoy, played beautifully by Christopher Plummer, is torn between his love and loyalty to his large family and to the Russian peasants and the rest of downtrodden humanity. His wife, Countess Sophya Tolstoy, played by Mirren, wishes for the royalties of his many novels to remain as part of the family estate, providing her, her children, her grandchildren with income for generations to come. Yet Tolstoy's personal philosophy has become a new emerging ideology and the primary disciple and mover of the movement wishes that Tolstoy would make all his works available free of copy right to anyone who wishes to publish and distribute his work. The screenwriters displayed perfect balance between Helen Mirren as the Countess, concerned with the security of herself and family and that of Paul Giamatti who is standardizing and canonizing Tolstoy's philosophy for the good of mankind. Is the Countess greedy? Yes, but so is everyone to some extent. It is a normal human emotion and it is not until the Countess becomes extremely histrionic that Count Leo Tolstoy becomes weary of her manipulation. Giamatti plays a more controlled and careful character, trying to make the works of the great writer as accessible and affordable as possible, yet in the name of loving and helping mankind, he cuts corners and hurts. This is not a simple issue for we have seen the results of ideology gone wrong in the lives and careers of Robespierre, Pol Pot, Jim Jones, Stalin, and others. The zealot who will hurt other humans for a higher good is a theme of great importance for ideologies that are meant to spread love often spread pain, hatred, and intolerance. Tolstoy is torn between them personally and intellectually and the film displays his struggle to reconcile these warring camps. The screen writers inserted the nave, thoughtful, observer in the character of Tolstoy's new secretary, played by James McAvoy. Tolstoy insists that all world religion is based on the common concept and experience of human love. McAvoy begins to experience that love and it opens him up to the struggle that Count Tolstoy undergoes in the power struggle between his wife and his disciples. Valentin, the secretary, is amazed that Tolstoy wishes to know all about him and to hear his life experiences. He is amazed that a great man wishes to hear the experiences and thoughts of a young man rather than relate his own illustrious career and philosophy. I love this concept in the film for great men are open to experiences of others, to their views, their pain and belief, for it fuels the mind and soul of a great man to hear these things.  Tolstoy is the great man who wishes not to impress you with his philosophy but to open you to your own personal philosophy. The virgin Valentin is opened to a world of emotion, experience, and love when he meets a fellow pilgrim, Masha, played by the subtle beauty, Kerry Condon. Valentin is placed in a similar situation to Tolstoy, do we side with those whom we love or do we side with those comrades who join us in philosophy and ideology for the better good?  Valentin calls Masha to him whereas Tolstoy must separate himself from hysteria to gain peace of mind in his final days.

The film is a beautiful life affirming experience and is highly recommended. I left the film feeling elated for there are no easy solutions, there are no uncomplicated relationships, there are no decisions that don't have unforeseen consequences; yet the human heart is a guide - a blind, innocent, easily fooled guide, but a guide none the less.",1358121600,3,4175,4.876056338028169
4080087,4,B00370843A,"Admittedly, I was a bit bored with this movie up to about the 30 minute mark.  Here was the story of Leo Tolstoy's last year and I thought it was going to play out in real time!  Alas, the actors kick into gear and save a dull screenplay.  I was also interested in learning a bit more about Tolstoy than what I already knew (not much).  Evidently he was considered a near saint, based on what the Russian people thought.  The film is buoyed by some great actors of our day.  Christopher Plummer is a standout as Tolstoy and deserved his Oscar nom.  Helen Mirren is great as usual as Tolstoy's wife Sofya, with whom he has some remarkable battles.  The supporting cast is terrific as well, especially James McAvoy as the writers assistant and Paul Giamatti as the leader of the Tolstoyian movement and threat to Sofya's attempt to maintain her husband's estate.  In the end the movie works as I was very impressed with the Russian landscape of 1910 and of the thespians who deliver the goods.

The Last Station's scrumptious 1080p Blu-ray transfer accentuates the film's lavish cinematography. Colors are the transfer's most impressive element; the many outdoor scenes about the Russian countryside dazzle with an array of natural hues that bring the environment to life.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is equally impressive delivering perfect ambiant sound from the many outdoor scenes as well as an extended scene involving a train.",1332806400,3,1431,4.8
4080088,5,B00370843A,"This movie is about the last days of Leo Tolstoy as his aide Chertkov conspires to get his (Tolstoy's) will changed to leave the copyright to his books to the people of Russia rather than to his family.  Tolstoy's wife Sophia is working just as hard to prevent that.  The new secretary Valentin is on everybody's side and tries to negotiate a compromise at every turn, while falling in love with a young woman on Tolstoy's compound.  The love story between Leo and his wife is very real and touching.  I fell in love with Leo Tolstoy (as Levin)myself when I read Anna Karenin, and this movie, historically accurate or not, portrays him as a very lovable man.  To me, a movie is good if I get so involved in the story that I forget I'm watching a movie; that happened to me with this one.  The acting is remarkable, the production and directing is perfect. This is a great movie that left me in tears.  It's worth watching a second time.",1329177600,5,936,4.406976744186046
4080089,3,B00370843A,"This film is beautifully photographed; is attentive to period details in terms of settings and costumes, and has moments of well-crafted acting.  I'm thinking of a scene between Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer in the Tolstoy bedroom (it's the scene pictured on the movie case).  The two actors and the situation they are creating, suddenly seem 'real' - an elderly husband and wife, married for almost fifty years, who know each other inside and out; both ""in love"" and in something less than love.  In other words, that scene rang true.

I wasn't aware that THE LAST STATION had been a 1990 novel until I saw this in the closing credits.  Yet thinking it over, the film has that ""novelettish"" quality - a culled-from-fiction mood.  Certain dialogue, and the circumstances it's dramatizing (sometimes over-dramatizing) do make it seem to be, for the most part, a piece of affectionate historical fiction, even though it's generally based on real life people and events.  This isn't a knock against dramatized fiction - but for me, this film didn't establish the consistent emotional depth that makes a viewer forget it's fiction; that makes it a ""reality.""  Sometimes it has that depth, but only at odd moments - like the bedroom scene I've referred to, or, when Tolstoy is talking with his secretary - but it's uneven.

I thought the actress who played Tolstoy's daughter, Sasha, was badly miscast, and/or just badly written.  Instead of the real-life resentment and dislike that mother and daughter felt for each other, and the hefty looks and solid demeanor of the real Alexandra Tolstoy - a woman so devoted to her father that she married one of his disciples without love - we are given a thinly drawn, repressed, very English-spinster ""type"", who cries ""Pa-pa! Pa-pa!"" like a parrot.  The same goes for the actress who plays Masha, who to me remains a resolutely fictional character, created as a sex interest.

The film wants to be meaningful and important - but can't seem to find its way.  I was neither intrigued, enthralled, or taken into its world (the way I'd hoped to be, given its superlative reviews).  Instead, I felt restless.  I enjoyed Christopher Plummer's performance, I liked most of Helen Mirren's, and Paul Giametti does a nice job.  James McAvoy seems a bit lost to me, or at least his character did - he always portrays a sweetly confused boy-man very well, and maybe that's supposed to be a good performance, but I find his lack of range annoying.  I certainly didn't believe in his character's love for the resolutely fictional Masha, and their reconciliation scene at the railroad station only took away from the REAL drama:  the heartbreak of Sonya, at Tolstoy's deathbed.

All in all - an odd conglomeration of fact and fiction, given voice by some talented actors.  Worth watching once, but hardly memorable.",1328227200,4,2846,4.90187891440501

SPOILER ALERT!!!

This film is very well-acted. I don't know how much of it is accurate (except for Tolstoy dying at Astapovo in the course of a dramatic flight from home). Everyone does an excellent job in this movie, especially Academy Award winner Dame Helen Mirren. There is one scene in the movie that stands out in my mind: when an aria from an opera by Puccini is playing whilst Sofya and Fedorovich are having dinner and Tolstoy comes in and Sofya works herself into a rage as the aria reaches its emotional climax. That scene was very well-written and well-acted. Another scene comes to mind when Sofya storms in on Chertov and Tolstoy while they're talking, she slips and falls and accuses them of plotting in her own house whilst she's lying on the floor. Ms. Mirren is a fine actress and really good (see her in the HBO miniseries Elizabeth I). I have only one question: What did Sofya read in the diary that mader her furious? Should have been rated PG-13.",1319068800,,1017,4.551912568306011
4080093,3,B00370843A,"This film gave us such a tiny piece of Tolstoy's great life and work, and that piece at the very end of his life when he was physically and mentally spent -- what was the point?  What did we learn about him except that his marriage was not happy toward the end?

Even the things we do learn are suspect.  Did his wife really have a huge part in the creation of his novels or did she just make a few suggestions about what a woman might say? Were we to believe that Tolstoy was a hypocrite because he was affectionate with his aged wife and was a hearty eater?  The film also wants us to see the young secretary as a bit of a hypocrite and this seems based on the fact that he had an affair with the character Masha.  If a young man had entered the bed of a professed celibate and forced his attentions on her we would probably not be as sympathetic toward him as we are asked to be to Misha.  I found her extremely unlikeable.

Tolstoy is one of the greatest novelists and thinkers of all time and I feel that this movie trivializes him and his ideas. Even the repeated statement that he ""abandoned his wife,"" seems overblown.  With his health failing, after collapsing under the strain of her hysterical scenes, he tells her that if she can't stop he will have to go where he can find peace and so he finally does. I wouldn't call that abandonment as much as a case of his wife forcing him to leave their home for his own health's sake. She was hardly left to fend for herself in a castle full of servants.",1315785600,2,1507,4.172413793103448
4080094,3,B00370843A,"I finally got around to watching `The Last Station' this past weekend, and I must say that it wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  It excelled in some key areas (the performances are all uniformly good and the film is undeniably `beautiful' to look at) but it failed to captivate me the way I wanted it to, and the film's construction is a bit generic, clich&eacute;d and dull.

`The Last Station' relays the end of Tolstoy's life, complete with internal drama that flooded his home thanks to the butting-of-heads between his vivacious wife Sofya and his overly-loyal aid, Chertkov.  Tolstoy has developed an antimaterialist movement that threatens the wellbeing of his family after his eventual demise, and his wife is desperate to save their fortunes.  Despite living in wealth, Tolstoy despises it and Chertkov manipulates that for his own ideals.  Entering the battlezone is a young secretary named Valentin.  Valentin is trying his hardest to live a life according to Tolstoy's values (including abstinence), but he never imagined the difficulties his own conscience would play on his ability to uphold his beliefs, especially when he begins to sympathize with Sofya and her plight.

My main issue with the film is that fact that it doesn't have any pep in its step.  Outside of a steamy sex scene between James McAvoy and Kerry Condon, the film doesn't have much spice.  It tries to be comedic in scenes, but it doesn't always pull that off and so this biopic, which struggles to be both a drama and a comedy, becomes rather unfocused and uninteresting.  As the film enters its second act it starts to lag a bit and eventually a film that is under two-hours feels like it is stretching out over three.  I also found the script to be a tad predictable and underdeveloped.  Take for instance Valentin's values.  He is a devout Tolstoyan, and yet almost immediately after settling in at the estate he makes love to Condon's character.  He doesn't even really put up a fight.  His character loses a lot of individuality because he becomes an unreliable moral centerpiece.  The film also feels too mechanical in parts, like it is trying too hard to be `exact' even in the moments that feel less than reliable.  It loses that `lived in' feel because of it.

But, the acting is a triumph if not a tad stagy.  I enjoyed nearly everyone (I'm a firm advocate for Paul Giamatti, but he did nothing here but the usual clich&eacute;), especially the supporting women; Kerry Condon and Anne-Marie Duff.  James McAvoy needs to carry a better film soon.  He has such talent, and he's been showcasing it in prestige films like this one (as well as the glorious `Atonement' and `The Last King of Scotland') but he still seems to be flying under the radar.  He gives a beautifully channeled performance, despite limitations within the script, and he actually ends up outshining the bigger stars here.  Helen Mirren chews scenery like no one else in this film, and she does it well.  She always feels authentic, even when her actions are pure bait.  Christopher Plummer is soft and centered and very `Tolstoy', which also makes him rather secondary to the actorly theatrics going on around him.  Still, he understood the character very well.

I just wish that the director understood the material, or at least how to present it.  The film is far from bad, but it is also far from great.  It just panders on `fine', never elevating into something I'd want to watch again.",1302652800,3,3456,4.771043771043771
4080095,3,B00370843A,"This film did not work for me, despite all the acting stars and the beautiful cinematography. It is maybe too didactic (like a literature cum history class for high school students) and too crowded with themes.
We watch Leo Tolstoy in his last life stage, surrounded by 'Tolstoyans', a sectarian group fighting private property and sexuality. Very simply put. A bunch of nut cases.
Not even Helen Mirren as feisty countess Sofya fighting the madness of sectarianism and trying to maintain sanity and a healthy self-interest could make me keep my interest.
Ok, Plummer is Tolstoy incarnated, but so what, really. As long as there is no real plot and no real interest.
I am not that interested in the question whether the film gives us historical truth in this case, as we are clearly in a dead end street with this particular line of do-goodism, considering the road that real life decided to take. McAvoy's nave young man is very hard to keep watching in his shining sillitude.

4080099,4,B00370843A,"... well acted for the most part, beautifully photographed, an entertaining 113 minutes. But perhaps that's all it was, and all anyone should have expected. It's based, you know, on a novel by the American professor of literature Jay Parini that focuses on imaginatively probing the mind of Tolstoy's wife during the famous writer's last eccentric years. Christopher Plummer is quite convincing, in the film, in his portrayal of the capricious old megalomaniac .. but should I therefore credit his portrayal? Was Tolstoy the dupe of his own 'spiritual' dissatisfaction that the film asserts? Likewise paul Giamatti was skillfully despicable as the opportunist/hypocrite/sychophant Vladimir Chertkov, ostensibly the villain in the film who disrupts the marital harmony of Lev and Sofia. But was the real Chertkov such a scoundrel? Does it matter whether he was, for one's satisfaction with the film? And then, the two young observer-disciples, Valentin and Masha -- attractive beings, especially Masha -- but didn't their happy-ending romance rather sidetrack the more intriguing story of Tolstoy and his Countess and the whole world of tsarist Russia that hung on Tolstoy's words?

Honestly, taking the film as total fiction (instead of fictionalized history), I found the portrayal of Chertkov quite satisfying... but I have a deep-seated dislike for fakirs and fakers. Yes, yes! Every great-souled paraclete has been misrepresented and sullied by his exegete! Roshi Suzuki by Roshi Baker, Socrates by Plato, Marx by Lenin, Jesus Ben Joseph by Saul AKA Paul. :-|

The one truly dismal weakness of the film was the sound track, the dopey and anachronistic music that slurped out occasionally to cover transitions from scene to scene. Crisper editing and a few natural ambient noises would have eliminated the need for such mediocre music.

On the whole...

I was looking forward to learn more about his life and the only thing i came away with is that he had a difficult marriage (I would have been surprised only if he didn't!!). To compare for example in the movie Gandhi there was a very long scene/interview with journalists where Gandhi explains his thoughts on celibacy and experiments with it. Here instead you have Tolstoy teling his disciple that he doesn't belive in what he preaches and having a very merry time in bed with his aged wife.

And why do we care that he is free, since we didn't know he was not free when we saw him before?

STARRING: Helen Mirren, James McAvoy, Christopher Plummer, Kerry Condon, Paul Giamatti, Anne-Marie Duff, John Sessions and Patrick Kennedy

WRITTEN BY: Michael Hoffman; based on the novel by Jay Parini

DIRECTED BY: Michael Hoffman

Rated: R
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 04 December 2009

I love and adore Sandra Bullock and am happy for her that she received an Oscar. But if you ask me, it belonged to Helen Mirren for her performance in The Last Station. I was blown away. She was so natural, so sensational, and so terrific; as was the film as a whole, but we'll get to that shortly.

Mirren plays Sofya Tolstoy; the wife of legendary Russian author Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer). At times they seem like the perfect couple, but soon we realize that their long lasting relationship is plagued with problems and mistrust.

Leo has gained such notoriety for his fame in writing, that his wife fears others will take advantage of him for his wealth, and that if he should pass, she will be left with nothing. This fear is birthed primarily by a snooty little man by the name of Vladimir, played nicely by Paul Giamatti. Vladimir wants Leo to sign something that would handover creative control to some of his most astounding works.

James McAvoy also gives a radiant performance as Valentin; a promising young man plagued by his youthful insecurities so much that he has found himself to be a man, and yet still a virgin. He is hired on to assist Leo, and the two generate a rather wholesome friendship; Valenitn no doubt reminding Leo of himself as a youngster.

Valentin's friendship with Leo grows and thus causes him to be concerned for not only the old poet's health, but for what is to happen to his name, his wealth, his work, and his estate, should he leave this earth.

I loved to romance that thrived between Leo and Sofya; it was believable and filled with gloriously fun moments that were shadowed perfectly with ugly, dark ones. These actors are two truly gifted spirits indeed, and they did this film a supreme justice.

In addition to the Tolstoy romance, there is a younger one as well. A beautiful worker on Leo's estate named Sasha (Kerry Condon) is keen to Valentin's unique awkwardness and blinding charm. She smells it as easily as blood in the water to a shark; virgin! She's older, more experienced, and all the wiser, and she feeds on his innocence. Both deliver great perfect performances and they share a very intimate moment that was one of the steamiest of 2009.

The film is based on the real life of Leo Tolstoy, but it often feels like a play. Nearly the entire thing takes place in one central location (you can relax, it's very large and elegant; not the least bit boring) and these characters go through such small scales of playwright drama; but it's the way they handle them that turns them into massive cinematic treasures, and its divinely entertaining.

Somehow, I haven't the slightest clue how, but somehow, this film did not find itself nominated for best picture at the Oscars, which is astounding; especially considering there were a whopping 10 freaking nominees! It surely should have been nominated - at the very least, and I can think of more than one film that was nominated, the spot of which this gem could have rightfully plucked for itself.",1286409600,5,3314,4.742608695652174

4080107,5,B00370843A,"For anyone who loves classic Russian literature, Leo Tolstoy is one of the most beloved writers.  Best known for his novels ""Anna Karenina"" and ""War and Peace"" he is kind of a russian writer that captures russian soul and presents it to the world.  Tolstoy was a nobleman who lived long before Russian revolution and was well aware of social injustices.  He devotes his life in trying to change that in the ways he thinks best but manages to alienate himself from his family.

It is important to mention that during his times as a writer, there were no typing machines.  Most writers used there wives as editors, proofreaders and scribes.  Tolstoy's wife, Sophia Andreyevna was no exception.  Sophia was much younger than her husband but equally educated and sophisticated.  In her own way, she held onto her traditions that family property belongs to the next generation.  Considering that she copied ""War and Peace"" by hand six times, gaveLeo six children, kept his household running and took good care of him in every way, I cannot but agree that she had some say on her husband's copyrights and income that his work was generating.

This film focuses on Leo Tolstoy's last few months of his life.  By this time, he was famous, revered all over Russia and adored by people as a living legend.  Just as any other celebrity, he was surrounded by many people, many with their own agendas that they wanted to impose on him in different ways. Thsi film touches up on all of those relationships.  Christopher Plummer as Tolstoy and Helen Mirren as Sophia, Tolstoy's wife are absolutely fantastic is their respective roles.",1286150400,,1619,4.8014440433212995
4080108,5,B00370843A,"For those unfamiliar or uninterested in Russian literature, a film about the last days of writer Leo Tolstoy sounds gloomy indeed - all serious writer stuff. But ""The Last Station"" was lively and fun and harrowing by turns. Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren played Tolstoy and his wife, the aristocratic Sofya just a few years before the Russian Revolution. Leo is old but still feisty, and is surrounded by sycophantic ""Tolstoyans"" who revere the writer as a sort of messiah. Truly more ""Catholic than the pope,"" they are appalled when the old man, revered for his love of all forms of life, kills a mosquito on a fellow man's face. The film interweaves two love stories. There is the story of Valentin, an idealistic young writer visiting his idol, and Masha, a sexy, young, axe-swinging commune dweller who is at least twice as tough as Valentin. I'm not a huge fan of James McAvoy, but his playing of Valentin as a conflicted idealist was marvelous. The second story is the tempestuous marriage of Leo and Sofya  -- complicated Sofya's battle with the Tolstoyans over Tolstoy's estate. Sofya wants the money to support herself and her family; the Tolstoyans need it to further their movement. Helen Mirren and Paul Giamatti (as Vladimir Chertkov, leader of the Tolstoyans) are phenomenal as the antagonists.

As a film, ""The Last Station"" stands well on its own. But to a history geek like me, the extra dollop of background on the writer, his family, hectic life, high-minded ideals and devoted group of disciples made the film a standout.",1282953600,,1547,4.8783269961977185
4080109,4,B00370843A,"I give this film 4 stars mostly because of Helen Mirren's wonderful performance as Sofiya Tolstaya.  She really made you empathize with her character, as it seems Michael Hoffman wanted us to.  The only problem is that Vladimir Chertkov was not such a bad guy in real life.  He set up a publishing company called Intermediary 25 years before that published a great number of Russian writers including Tolstoy, Chekhov and Leskov, and was fully committed to the ideals and legacy of Tolstoy, not in stealing Yasnaya Polyana out from under dear Sofiya.

Not having read the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0307739643/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>, I can't say how many of these artistic liberties were that of Hoffman or the author Jay Parini, but what is frustrating about the story is the way these competing characters are played out pretty much like a standard melodrama with Valentin Bulgakov (seemingly a surrogate for Parini) as the active narrator, finding his true love among the idyllic charms of Tolstoy's experimental village.

Like most of the other characters in this story, Bulgakov is real, although he shouldn't be confused with the more famous Mikhail Bulgakov who later gave us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master-and-Margarita/dp/0141180145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master and Margarita</a>.  Valentin clearly takes the side of Sofiya in the dispute over the will that becomes the central drama of this story.  Chertkov is seen less as the aristocratic philanthropist, which he was, but rather a self-serving executor who tries to claim the publishing rights to all of Tolstoy's literary work, denying poor Sofiya a way of perpetuating the estate, which the cinematic Tolstoy clearly denounces.

The wild-eyed Valentin eventually trades in his self-imposed celibacy for the love of Masha, which seemed a forgone conclusion despite the less-than-manly way in which he wielded an axe.  But, it seems willing men were in short supply on the Tolstoy farm and Masha figured Valentin's idealism easy enough to overcome.

Sadly, this story does little more than distract the viewer away from the wonderful relationship developed between Mirren and Christopher Plummer, especially the wonderful bedroom scene which fully upstages that of Valentin and Masha.  Mirren and Plummer fill their roles with theatrical vigor worthy of a Moscow stage, while McAvoy and Condon come across like typical British television.

But, most annoying of all is Giamatti as Chertkov.  Not that I don't like Giamatti, but he is clearly miscast as the Russian publisher, giving viewers a totally wrong impression of this great man.  I guess Hoffman and/or Parini needed a villain for this story and Giamatti turns Chertkov into Boris Badenov.

Anyway, the movie is great fun if you take it for what it is, a melodrama, and not a evocation on Tolstoy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Days/dp/1112082298/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Days</a>.",1282780800,,3095,5.861915367483296
4080110,5,B00370843A,"Excellence! That is the only word I could think of when I finished watching this film. I had heard from friends that it was depressing and so I had shied away until it came out on DVD but I really shouldn't have because this movie has everything that a fantastic movie should: great actors, a wonderful story, superb screenwriting, and interesting characters (amongst other things).

Christopher Plummer plays Leo Tolstoy who is at the end of his life and at odds with himself, the ideologies that he created, his family, and followers. Helen Mirren pulls out an exceptional performance as Tolstoy's wife, former muse, confidante, and eventual nemesis. However, this movie is not just about the dissolution of a marriage (though that is certainly an excellent piece). It's also about Tolstoy's legacy and those who will fight tooth and nail to preserve it even if it means casting aside his wife. James McAvoy is called in to be a secretary to Tolstoy. Yet it soon becomes clear that he was actually hired to be a spy for Tolstoy's aid who is trying to change the writer's will so that Tolstoy's wife will receive none of the royalties to her husband's own works. As it becomes clear that Tolstoy is in his last days, those around him scramble to secure their needs before the great artist is laid to rest.

It was only when the credits finally rolled that I realized I hadn't breathed in over two hours. Each scene was magnificent in every possible way from the acting to the cinematography. The script was so tight that I don't think I could find a single loose end to complain about. Mirren's portrayal of Tolstoy's jilted wife was filled with such complexity that I found myself in total awe of her performance. McAvoy's character development was to be believed! His ability to go from a naive writer who worshiped the master Tolstoy to a realistic and forgiving man who acknowledged his heroes faults and successes was brilliantly nuanced. Of course the film would have been quite different had Plummer not made such a remarkable performance. He allowed the contradictions within Tolstoy's character to truly show without making him appear insincere or fickle.

and his family, namely his wife.

followers and his true feelings about his family.
Helen Mirren made a good effort.  Christopher Plummer may be a wrong casting choice.

Excellent films like Doctor Zhivago (romantic view) and Reds (realistic view) are interesting, but the founding idea was never fully explored. ""The Last Station"" seems to lend a bit of a preface to all this. Leo Tolstoy is arguably the greatest of Russian literary figures; he was considered a champion of the people, though he was incredibly wealthy. He was generous with his wealth, but never failed to enjoy his servants and lovely life-style. Indeed, he had a commune on his property. The film, wonderfully realized by director Michael Hoffman, gives a glimpse of this pre-Bolshevik era, period-perfect, and beautifully photographed. Tolstoy, as depicted by the master Christopher Plummer, is a regular guy, who is a bit overwhelmed by the attention given him, including that of his best friend, Chertkov (Giamatti). He loves flattery. The brilliant Helen Mirren plays the wife, Sofia, concerned that her hubby might give away all his money and possessions, leaving nothing for their children. Entering this enigmatic scenario is Valentin, so enamored of Tolstoy's writing, that he's stayed celibate. Enough of that. It's Valentin who is the central character, and I'll never understand why James McAvoy hasn't received more award recognition for his immense talent to absorb his characters. He learns, grows, and finally understands that Leo is simply a very nice, smart man who never wanted to be taken SO seriously. The acting in ""The Last Station"" is nothing short of perfect, from all involved. Hoffman has presented a fine tale, filling in a few holes in my understanding of this era in Russian history. Never boring, lots of humor, and gorgeous to look at, Hoffman's film is a treat. Very fine; recommended.",1281398400,,1807,5.213058419243986

4080116,5,B00370843A,"The year is 1910 and Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer), a Russian aristocrat and revered author (War and Peace, Ana Karenina) is 82 years old. Now the leader of the Tolstoi's movement that proposes brotherly love and world peace through pacifism, he scorns his wealth and is considering writing a new will by which he'd relinquish all the rights of his novels to the Russian people.

Tolstoi's wife, Contessa Sophia (Helen Mirren), opposes this new will and thus, she is in the eyes of Vladimir Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), Tolstoi's chief follower, the enemy.

To spy on her and assure that Tolstoi signs the will, Chertkov sends an idealistic youth, Valentin Bulgakov (James McAvoy, Atonement), to work as Tolstoi's secretary. ""Write everything she does, everything she says,"" Chertkov instructs Valentin and gives him a journal to do so.

On her part, Contessa Sophia quickly befriends the young man and she too gives him a journal. ""Write what you see,"" she tells him. ""Write what you think.""

Valentin, a firm believer in the Movement, doesn't question Tolstoi's decision at first. But as he gets to know Sophia, and starts thinking on his own, his devotion to the movement falters.

""I typed Ana Karenina six times,"" Sophia tells Valentin. ""I discussed the characters with him as he wrote War and Peace.""

Not to mention the 13 children she had with him.

Is Chertkov right on wanting Tolstoi to sign the rights of his novels to the Russian people instead of to his wife and children? Valentin ponders as he bluntly asks Tolstoi whether he loves his wife and he, himself, falls in love.

At the end, the decision of whether to sign or not, is thrown back at Valentin in a humorous twist, I won't reveal.

The Last Station is a quiet movie I enjoyed watching, especially for its realistic portrayal of a world one hundred years in the past. A world where journalists camping outside Tolstoi's house typed their articles on typewriters, and photographers followed him dragging their cameras, the size of shoeboxes, on tripods.

A world where carriages were still drawn by horses, and trains ran on coal leaving a trail of smoke behind as they rushed majestically through the fields. A world where messages were sent by telegraph, and the phonograph that allowed the recording of the human voice had just been invented.

Many things have changed since, yet the conflict between man and wife, love and duty, still resonates with us, unresolved.",1280448000,,2443,4.905339805825243

4080118,5,B00370843A,"Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer get to chew up the scenery in this drama based on the last days of Tolstoy.

In his dotage the great novelist has become a counter-culture guru, wearing homespun shifts, sporting an immense beard and entertaining the idea of giving away his possessions to the people. He has inspired an entire movement that preaches sexual abstinence and returning to the land.

Naturally, Countess Tolstoy, his wife of 46 years, does not approve and conducts a guerrilla war with the head of the Tolsoyan movement for the great man's soul -- and the rights to his books.

Mirren brings out the complexities of the Countess' character. She is sometimes girlish, sometimes hard as nails, sometimes wild and unpredictable. The movie brings out the embers of love that still exist between her and Tolstoy, who is being dragged in two directions.

Into this mix comes Tolstoy's new secretary played by MacAvoy. A sub-plot deals with his ""sentimental education"" at the hands of a girl called Masha, a devotee of Tolstoy with a hard-baked attitude to the world.

It's all quite riveting and in the end highly affecting. Tolstoy can't stand being with the countess and flees with a doctor and a daughter by train but is taken ill. He ends up in the home of a small provincial station master with the world press encamped outside on a death watch. It's an early case of celebrity journalism which the movie portrays with great historical accuracy.

It's sad to see a great man brought low by old age -- but great to see mature actors in their prime delivering wonderful performances.

One criticism -- this dvd cries out for extra material that would explain the history and background -- but there is nothing.",1280102400,3,1723,4.820338983050847
4080119,5,B00370843A,"Loved it. It's a romance, historical dramatization of a real writing master. What drama Tolstoy had in his life. No wonder he wrote so well. Watch this, not as entertainment, although the superb acting does that too, but as a period documentary on the end portion of the life of a great man. You'll want for more when it is done. Tolstoy actually dies in the home of the railroad stationmaster, not in the station.

There's plenty of reviews about the outstanding role performances by Helen Mirren (Prime Suspect) and Christopher Plummer , Mr. and Mrs. Tolstoy. Perfection is the most concise word to use. But the story was being told from the point of view of the newly hired private secretary to Tolstoy. This young man, Valentin, was played by James McAvoy (Becoming Jane) and deserves his own round of praise. He is dramatic and funny, at least as much as this tragic romantic story will allow. It is he and another hired girl at the Tolstoy estate, played by Kerry Condon, who do the bed scenes which cause the warnings on the box.

It is truly a sophisticated, historical, documentary/drama, adult film, not one for the children. They would not care for it. But you will! Rated R, which means restricted, but could, in this case also mean REGAL.

Another pair of characters, Tolstoy's daughter played by Anne-Marie Duff, and his political friend, Chertkov (Paul Giamatti) do such a good job of being the characters they play that you develop a distaste for them.

Wonderful film, highly recommended. Beautifully filmed, wondrous period tale based on a novel by Jan Perini. Subtitles for the feature as well as some of the bonus stuff.",1280102400,4,1640,4.764084507042254
4080120,5,B00370843A,"A splendid movie with a spectacular cast, about the final days of Leo Tolstoy, his work, his philosophy, his followers and his family. The chemistry between the high spirited, elegant Sofya Tolstoy (Helen Mirren) and pacifist bohemian Leo (Christopher Plummer) is rhapsodic! Tolstoy's quest to pursue idealism, in his final years, involves increasing conflict with retaining material possessions (for his family) and being true to his beliefs. Complicating this cleverly wry drama is a grand supporting cast. Most notable is his most trusted advisor (still creepy) Chertkov, played to perfection by Paul Giamatti--- (kinda like Dick Cheney in early Russia, kept waiting to see a lawyer get shot by the pond)....and to add balance, the navet and purity of Tolstoy's new assistant (bravo to James McAvoy!)---who finds truth in his own observations and actions, very different from the political choreography he studied..

Anyhow, the story is wonderfully engaging,the primary cast is astounding, cinematography beautifully done, and direction is sublime. Costumes and sets were amazing...Sophya was indeed a diva and wore the plumage well! The film editing on the DVD had one minor flaw (a small gap), which seemed very odd in a movie of this caliber. It did not diminish the power of the film, or its message. Plummer and Mirren together are fabulous fireworks! Love, in Tolstoy's view, is the ONLY common denominator for all religions...and remains the answer to everything complex and true...

As Tolstoy's health fails, an internecine war is waged between Tolstoy's wife Sofia (Helen Mirren) and the reptilian Vladimir Chertov (Paul Giamatti), who has parasitically attached himself to Tolstoy's legacy as his ""guardian"".

All this is seen through the wide eyes of Valentin Bulgarkov (James McAvoy), hired as a secretary by Chertov, but quickly converted into an ally by Sofia.

""Last Station"" is lifted above the usual by two wonderful performances by Helen Mirren and Christopher Plummer.  I would rate Plummer's the best male performance of the year.... but unfortunately it is buried in the well-manicured recesses of a period piece,  a genre that is for the most part devalued like the comedy when it comes to the Oscars.

On the minus side was James McAvoy, who seems like a pale imitation of Jude Law, or Kenneth Branagh.

It is worth noting that Helen Mirren has a natural interest in doing Russian roles because of her heritage (I believe she was born Helen Mironov)... and she seems to bring considerable insight to these performances, which would include her turn as Ayn Rand in ""The Passion of Ayn Rand""...",1278892800,,1303,4.8954545454545455

The last days of Leon Tolstoi (superbly played by Christopher Plumer, nominated as Best Supporting Actor)are portrayed with febrile emotion. Hoffman knew to blend the discursive speech of that age, in which Tolstoi is well conscious his undeniable prestige and admiration, but with the sins of the golden ages. Vanity, senile arrogance, decrepitude and loss of the opportunity.

The Modern age had arrived and the photography and gramophone initiate its shy steps. The script focuses the arid and troubled relationship with is wife, the Countess (the lovable Helen Mirren in a peerless role) and the emerging couple between a nave man and a very modern woman Sasha.

The memorable performances confer the movie the great pivot. Surrounded of that pastoral nostalgia and the well known provincial gossips, (specially notorious in the train station). Special kudos for Paul Giamatti who captured the poisonous nature of his personage with admirable naturalness.

I bring up the element of the cast at the outset because the version of this film that would have warranted a five star rating for me is the one in which Plummer's Leo Tolstoy is indeed the male lead.  Tolstoy, author of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace/dp/1593080735/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anna-Karenina/dp/0140449175/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anna Karenina</a>,"" and other light reads, was not merely the most famous author of his day, but also something of a secular saint because of his views on pacifism and ascetic morality.  Think of it this way: it would be like if Stephen King turned into Ayn Rand and was sought out by the paparazzi like J.K. Rowling.  The great man is in the last year of his life and while he is concerned with trying to live up to his ideals, which means abandoning his property and his family, the literary treasures that are his life's work are the subject of a vicious power struggle between his wife, Sofya (Mirren), who objects to anybody thinking her husband is Christ and worries that Tolstoy might be buying into that view, and his self-professed chief acolyte, Vladimir Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), who believes there is nothing in the world more important than Tolstoy's views.  Sofya wants the family to be able to live off the profits from those books, while Chertkov wants them to belong to the Russian people as a means of converting the masses to Tolstoy's principles.  Ironically, the Russian people indeed on the cusp of a monumental revolution, just not one involving Tolstoy.

This set up places Tolstoy at the nexus of a vortex of conflicts, with his inner conflict to live the life he asks others to lead overshadowed by the shouting matches between Sofya and Chertkov.  That is a pretty compelling storyline, but in adapting Jay Pirini's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0307739643/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>, writer-direction Michael Hoffman (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Restoration/dp/6305428379/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Restoration</a>"") has to keep a lot of this action in the background, because in the foreground is McAvoy's Valentin Fedorovich Bulgakov.  Perfectly willing to fall down at Tolstoy's feet and worship him, Valentin is given the opportunity to invade the inner circle as Tolstoy's private secret and also as a spy for Chertkov, who wants to know what Sofya is saying behind his back (although she has no compulsion to hold her tongue when the two adversaries are in the same room).  Tolstoy was into celibacy in theory, but (with 13 children) not in practice, and Valentin learns why when he encounters Masha (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kerry-Condon/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kerry Condon</a>), who has no problem being a devout believer without having to believe in that particular principle.  So there is a certain parallelism between the quests of Tolstoy and Valentin to find themselves during this time, but it is the latter whose story takes over the film, and thereby makes it less than it could have been.

Plummer's performance is the chief joy of ""The Last Station"" (the title comes from the train station where Tolstoy dies after finally getting up the nerve to leave home).  His character might have unlocked the secret to universal happiness, but there is no pontificating and no sense that he takes himself as seriously as those fawning upon him.  Tolstoy's biggest problem is that his wife and he are no longer on the same page, and as his life is going to an end she is doing nothing to make things easy for him.  Of course, Sofya says the same thing about him.  Yet the affection between them is obvious, as is the reverence they feel for the bond that formed so perfectly between them once upon a time.  Mirren is also excellent, playing a character that forgoes the icy reserve the actress has so often been required to play in her most recent roles.  Sofya is a character who gives full voice to her rages, who can cut a daughter to the quick with a single venomous line, and who has a flair for dramatics that serves well as the flip side of the coin to Plummer's calm and usually placid demeanor.  Giamatti is a fine foil, with a nice knack for making his earnest wishes seem rather ludicrous just because of the way he voices them.  McAvoy and Condon are fine, but suffer in comparison to Plummer and Mirren.

Towards the close of his life Tolstoy decides to leave his money to an idolized cause rather than to his family.  He also wants to denounce his title. His wife, the Countess played by Mirren, objects.  The couple have been together for 47 years and had 13 children together.  She's helped him with his writing.  They have a rich and complicated history.  Tolstoy's adviser, Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), is eager to have Tolstoy change his will leaving his money to the cause Chertkov represents.  The Countess is alternately livid and cajoling with her husband in trying to prevent this.  You can feel the layers of love as well as old grudges portrayed by Plummer and Mirren that's inherent in many long marriages.  The acting is wonderful and believable as is the setting.

4080130,5,B00370843A,"So much has been written about the evolvement of the movement toward social equality the grew out of the second half of the 19th century Russia that we often forget the gentler side of the true meaning of 'socialism': unfortunately it is inexorably tied to the now negative noun 'communism' and has colored the world view of the 20th century, losing sight of the original dreams of those who championed the beginnings of it.  THE LAST STATION  takes us to that time when the kinder aspects of of the movement reigned.  Celebrated writer and essayist Leo Tolstoy was deeply admired by the Russian people not only for his immense gifts as a writer, but also for his humanitarian concerns that created a solid movement at the end of his career.  Could a Count, man of wealth and royalty, forsake his worldly possessions (including the rights to the royalties of his books) and spread his belongings to the people of Russia?  If the answer were requested from his Countess wife Sofya the answer would be an emphatic NO!: this headstrong woman refused to consider letting her rights to  her husband's writings (which she helped create) evaporate into the hands of the 'ignorant poor masses' upon her husband's death.  This conflict forms the meat of the story related by THE LAST STATION.

Writer/Director Michael Hoffman beautifully adapted the novel by Jay Parini and selected a perfect cast to recreate this important period of time around the final days of Tolstoy's life.  Christopher Plummer is able to give us a fully realized portrait of the conflicted Tolstoy.  Paul Giamatti seethes oily evil as Tolstoy's principal disciple Chertkov, a man so driven to make Tolstoy's life's work into public domain that he alienates almost everyone he encounters.  Helen Mirren reveals all the love and passion and fury and rage as Sofya in a performance so richly detailed it must be seen several times to appreciate all the nuances. James McAvoy is the central figure of the story - the appointed secretary Valentin who is sent to Tolstoy's magnificent home to record all of the events developing in the Tolstoyian movement, a movement that included living in a commune where Valentin encounter's Masha (Kerry Condon) who helps him shed his outer shell of protective innocence to discover the true heart of Tolstoy's movement - Love!  Significant cameos are portrayed by Anne-Marie Duff as Tolstoy's daughter Sasha, Patrick Kennedy as Sergeyenko, and John Sessions as the doctor, Dushan. The film is a work of brilliant conversations, moments of history unraveled in a perfect way, and yet it is a film rich in comedy and in passion and in the struggle between a long married couple coming to grips with the change in the social milieu of the day.  The title refers to the isolated train station where Tolstoy died and the range of loss of dignity and retention of emotional power is mightier than the whole of changing Russia. The musical score is by Sergei Yevtushenko ('The Russian Ark') and the moody cinematography is by Sebastian Edschmid.

THE LAST STATION is a breath of fresh air for those who long for meaningful movies these days.  It calls upon the intellect, it satisfies the yearning to observe first class acting, and it dares to tell a story that will encourage discussion after seeing the film.  Would that there were more like this.  Grady Harp, June 10",1277337600,2,3363,4.882249560632689
4080131,4,B00370843A,"I've never read much about or anything written by Leo Tolstoy though like most I know the name and the books he was famous for, most notably WAR AND PEACE. So going into this film I had no idea that the man called by some the greatest novelist to ever live was behind a movement let alone a pacifist. And yet with THE LAST STATION we not only get a glimpse of that side of him but its effect on those around him.

The film takes place in Tolstoy's later years. As played by Christopher Plummer (in an Oscar nominated role), Tolstoy loves his family but fills him time as much with writing and furthering the cause of Tolstoyans. The Tolstoyans considered themselves Christians but based their faith more on the teachings of Jesus and less on the church, feeling that the church had connected itself far too much in the workings of the government. Tolstoyans also were a devoutly non-violent group of anarchists who also believed in sexual abstinence.

The central piece of the film revolves around a battle between Tolstoy's wife Sofya (Helen Mirren who was also nominated) and Vladimir Chetlov (Paul Giamatti), the head of the Tolstoyan organization. Their battle revolves around the rights to the works of Tolstoy. His wife believes he should leave them to her and his children, giving them the opportunity to live well after he would pass away. Chetlov believed he should sign the rights over to public domain so that the word could spread about his beliefs. While this might seem noble, there are always undercurrents that run beneath anyone's motives.

Chetlov sends a new secretary to Tolstoy named Valentin Bulgakov (James McAvoy). A Tolstoyan, Valentin is given the task of writing down everything he observes and reporting back to Chetlov. Amazingly enough, once he arrives he is given the exact opposite assignment by Sofya as well as a second journal.

What follows is a discovery of the reality of Tolstoy and his life as seen through Valentin's eyes. What one writes may be one thing but at the same time Tolstoy lived a life that was far from what his followers demanded of themselves. Tolstoy here is a man of great passion for life, great love for his wife and family and a man who wanted a better world and did all he could to make it so.

As Valentin watches the battles between husband and wife, he also sees the love and emotion the pair share as well. And by the end of the film he is witness to the hypocrisy of members of the group as well as the conspiracies laid out by both parties in an attempt to get what they want.

The film moves at a steady pace never relying on action but more on storytelling to tell the tale. It's not just about this battle over the will but a glimpse at fame, fortune and the baggage it brings with it. It's a story that shows how far fanaticism will influence people who seem more intent on their own beliefs and desires than those of the group. And it's a story of love that is discovered as Valentin suspends his beliefs for a woman he meets and falls in love for after seeing the affections shared between Tolstoy and his wife.

The movie offers some of the best acting I've seen in some time. Each actor gives a performance that leaves you feeling as if they are the characters and not just portraying them. Never once will you find yourself checking the clock to see how much longer the film is. It holds your interest from start to finish.

Perhaps the best thing about this film is that it makes you want to dig just a bit into history to find our more about the real story. And to take a look at Tolstoy's books and do a little reading. One thing is certain. This movie will entertain and enlighten just a bit and make you realize that, as Tolstoy seemed to believe, love is at the root of everything.",1277078400,2,3764,4.484671532846716
4080132,5,B00370843A,"Other reviewers here have gone into great detail about the plot of this 2009 film that garnered TWO Academy Award nominations (but, alas, no wins) for Helen Mirren as Best Actress and Christopher Plummer as Best Supporting Actor. Therefore I won't be repetitive about the plot.  I'll approach this from a different angle.

First off, I must admit I'm a HUGE Helen Mirren fan. She can do no wrong, in my opinion, and her name on a film project leads me to some interesting films. Paul Giamatti is always fascinating to watch too and Christopher Plummer will always be in my mind as Baron von Trapp in ""The Sound of Music"". But its Mirren who really impresses me with her range - and her ageless beauty - and it was she who drew me into this film.

There are many comparisons to historical drama like ""War and Peace"" in some of the other reviews. But this is not that kind of story. It's a ""political"" drama, as well as a domesticone. But, its also reasonably shore for such a drama too, clocking in at well under two hours! And so even those with short attention spans will enjoy it. And to keep your attention, Director Michael Hoffman gives us, not one but two, nude love scenes (neither with Mirren, but rather with the young couple).

The image on the DVD is sharp and clear and the bonus features are quite extensive. There are a few deleted scenes as well as a pretty funny ""gag reel"" of bloopers - with the cast (including Mirren and Plummer) using the ""F word"" a lot. (Don't leave this one on for the kiddies <g>.). There is a 15-minute featurette interview with Plummer about his career and he's definitely frank about his alcoholism. And lastly there is a full length commentary with not only Director Hoffman, but with Mirren and Plummer as well. I admit I did not listen to this last bonus because of time.

If you want to know more about the man behind ""War and Peace"" and ""Anna Karinina"" (and the woman behind HIM!), I highly recommend this DVD. Or even if all you want to do is watch Mirren act, it'll be well worth you time!""

4080135,4,B00370843A,"The film tells the story of Tolstoy's final days, presumably told within the parameters of the actual events. There are strong dramatic performances and the sets of the countryside, Moscow, trains, the ""last station"" and the interiors of Tolstoy's country home and Moscow office are great.

Mirren and Plummer bring to life two provocative individuals and the issue of fundamental disagreement within a marriage and partnership. The Tolstoy's long and presumably loving relationship, encompassing the birth of 13 children(8 of whom survived), is now ending as Count Tolstoy anticipates his death. He plans to leave his copyrights to the ""People of Russia"". Countess Sofya, who had a role in creating the novels, feels abandoned by his decision.

I believe the movie would be stronger if there were some foreshadowing as to how Tolstoy decided this. The Tzar's oppression and the ideas emanating from the West are off stage. Tolstoy's own estate is idyllic and his peasants (presumably the surfs liberated by Alexander II) seem well fed and non-descript (i.e. not shown as discontent). Moscow appears as a prospering city, not one in need of a revolution. Without an explanation, and with the depiction of the mentally and physically deteriorating Tolstoy, and with the devilish role played by Paul Giamatti, the film leads you to conclude that Tolstoy is being manipulated by his followers.

The parts for Tolstoy and the Countess are well written, but the romance between Valentin and Masha had a big reality gap for me. While Valentin's role as Tolstoy's secretary is believable, Masha's aggressive visit to his room is not. Her later switch from a physical to a loving partner and even her well pressed shirt in the chopping wood scene are stretches. I presume the romance is intended to show that indoctrination has not muted Valentin's human qualities, but there are more nuanced ways to show this.

Maybe I missed it, but I'm not sure how/why Valentin appeared at the station. I thought that he had been ordered to look after Sofya.

This is a very thought provoking film. Sofya knows she is losing her husband and will soon face the world alone. She has received no public credit for what she cites as major support in creating the world acclaimed novels. She worries about her future (although it appears the vast estate will be hers). She feels artistic ownership although this and the role of women are not themes. Sofya acts out her frustration which her rivals, including a bratty daughter, easily use against her.

Despite the shortcomings above the Mirren and Plummer performances, the beautiful sets and thought provoking story make this a worthwhile movie to see.",1269043200,5,2679,5.036117381489842
4080136,4,B00370843A,"Michael Hoffman's ""The Last Station"" is less a serious consideration of the life, work and philosophy of Tolstoy than a chance for high-powered actors to chew the scenery. But when the actors are Helen Mirren, Christopher Plummer and Paul Giamatti, it's a supreme pleasure to sit back and let them go at it. Frankly, I think James McAvoy overdoes his doe-eyed innocent act as Valentin, caught between his allegiance to the Tolstoyist movement and his natural sympathy for Tolstoy's family. But Mirren is magnificent as Tolstoy's raging, crockery-smashing wife Sofya, fighting for her family's rights and prosperity as well as for the affection of her crotchety husband. And Giamatti is great fun as the oily, scheming Vladimir Chertkov, who dreams of heading an international Tolstoyist movement funded munificently by the great man's copyrights. Meanwhile, Plummer fills the screen as Tolstoy, a beguiling combination of wise old codger and capricious Old Testament God.

The performances here are a riveting exhibition of controlled chaos, as the actors (especially Mirren) punch every scene up to the rafters yet never seem to go over the top. Hoffman never leaves you in doubt that he sides with Sofya, who endured multiple sacrifices and humiliations for the sake of her genius husband. But all of the characters are given their say, and even Chertkov gets a modicum of sympathy. Emotions run high throughout the movie, and by the time it reaches its poignant end in the eponymous railway station, you're likely to feel pretty emotional yourself.

4080138,3,B00370843A,"If you've read War and Peace and Anna Karenina or any other works by Tolstoy, the idea of a film about the great Russian author's fascinating latter years as he disavowed his earlier writings for deep religious principles and social reform is an intriguing prospect, but I'm sure there can't be too many others similarly thrilled by the notion.

It is a strange subject to make a film around, there's no denying that, and indeed The Last Station - based around the struggle over the publishing rights of his entire works between Tolstoy's favourite disciple Chertkov (who wants them to be given freely to the people) and the Countess Sofya (who believes they belong to the family and herself who have supported the Count over the years) - isn't the most dramatically thrilling of situations.  To add variety to the constant back and forth battles, showdowns and shouting matches between Chertkov and the Countess over the terms of Tolstoy's will, there is a conventional romance thrown in between nave new disciple Bulgakov and the rather more worldly Masha on Tolstoy's commune.

Despite the fact that nearly all the situations take place around him between the other protagonists, Tolstoy however rightly retains the strongest position in the film, a fact that can be attributed almost entirely to a convincing performance by Christopher Plummer.  While performances are equally as good elsewhere from Helen Mirren, James McAvoy, Paul Giamatti and John Sessions (particularly Mirren), it's hard not to see them as indeed ""performances"" by well-known and respected actors, whereas Plummer completely inhabits his role and convinces as Tolstoy, putting real character behind the man's revolutionary ascetic, pacifistic ideals.  While it never really explores these beliefs and sentiments in any great detail (go read Tolstoy's later works if you are interested, they are worthwhile and, ironically, out of copyright in English translation they can now all be downloaded for free from Gutenberg), it does go some way towards making The Last Station a little more meaningful and enjoyable as a film.",1266969600,43,2097,5.210682492581602
4080139,5,B00370843A,"""War & Peace"" and ""Anna Karenina"" are two of the longest and most famous novels in Russian literature (as of this writing, I'm about 800 pages into the first; only 400 to go), produced by author Count Leo Tolstoy (""Lev"", literally, transliterated into English as Leo).  In the 21st century, they're really the only things that most people are familiar with about him, but, apart from a raft of other (much shorter) fiction, Tolstoy, in the later decades of his, became a central figure in the global pacifist movement, a Christian anarchist philosopher par excellence who corresponded with a young Gandhi, and who was cited as the most influential pacifist in the world by American feminist Jane Addams in 1902.  His death was news worldwide.  ""The Last Station"", based on a novel of the same name by Jay Parini, depicts his final months, and the conflict between his wife and his acolytes over his literary legacy.  Directed by Michael Hoffman, ""The Last Station"" is a quality period drama that should interest fans of the genre.  Spoilers are discussed below.

The novel was written in an epistolary format, with a number of different narrators on a chapter-by-chapter basis:  Tolstoy himself, his wife Countess Sofya Tolstoya, his daughter Sasha Tolstoya, his doctor Dushan Makovitsky, his ally Vladimir Chertkov, and his private secretary Valentin Bulgakov.  The film telescopes things considerably, with the Tolstoys and Bulgakov the primary focus; the others are present, but as supporting characters.  Bulgakov (James McAvoy; as in ""The Last King of Scotland"", playing the viewpoint character to other actors who earn the Oscar nominations; poor guy) is selected by Chertkov (Paul Giamatti) as the new secretary, as well as Chertkov's man in the Tolstoy residence, since he needs to keep an eye on the Countess.  At stake is Tolstoy's copyrights, which his wife wants to pass to his heirs to sustain the family (they've a standing offer a million rubles for the whole set, which is nothing to turn down lightly), while Chertkov wants the whole body of work to enter the public domain, as a gift to the people of Russia (and the world).  The Countess (Helen Mirren, who earned her fourth Oscar nomination for her dynamite work here) is very materially-minded, unlike Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer, who was finally delivered from the ranks of great actors passed for Oscar nominations with his role), who lives in a state of deepening spiritual conflict over the lavish lifestyle his wife desires.

The conflict between intellectual ideas and practice is at the heart of the film.  Tolstoy himself admits that he is, in a lot of ways, not a very good Tolstoyan, mainly when it comes to his ideas about the value of chastity (having thirteen children, and quite a few past lovers).  Bulgakov, young and idealistic, finds himself increasingly involved with Masha (Kerry Condon), a spirited woman at the Tolstoyan commune; and, in his capacity as secretary, he's at the centre of the tug-of-war between Sofya and Chertkov.  Bulgakov finds himself increasingly drawn to the side of Sofya, who sees Tolstoy's work as the work of her life as well; anyone can sympathize with somoene who copied out ""War & Peace"" in longhand six times.  Mirren invests her with quite a bit of relatability, as well showing her a truly spectacular drama queen (much more of one than any of the four real queens Mirren has played).  She's well-matched with Plummer; their scenes together are the highlights of the film.  McAvoy does what his role requires, and he and Condon make a believable couple, even if their more low-key characters are always in the Tolstoys' shadow.  Also present is McAvoy's real-life wife Anne-Marie Duff (amusingly not playing his love interest, but Tolstoy's daughter Sasha).  Giamatti and John Sessions (as the family doctor) provide able support.

The film is more direct than the novel in taking sides in the battle between Sofya and Chertkov, pronouncedly sympathizing with her, which is, I think, a somewhat indulgent view in many ways.  It's quite true she invested a lot of her life in the work, but the film deals only glancingly with the social justice concerns at the heart of the Tolstoyan movement.  The reality of Russia in 1910 was a population of tens of millions living in abject poverty and illiteracy (one of my favourite parts of the novel, not included here, was Tolstoy's speculation about what those millions could possibly think of a novelist, not being able to read, nor really having the time for such things), under the sway of a despotic Tsar, a corrupt government, and an indifferent ruling class, a class that Countess Tolstoya belonged to.  The core dispute between Sofya and Chertkov was that Chertkov cared quite a bit about the plight of those millions, and Sofya not at all; Chertkov's great sin was being more interested in the world's grotesque social problems than keeping the Tolstoy family in their enormous mansion.  Sympathetic as she might be at times, a bit more perspective might be advised there.

4080140,5,B00370843A,"""The Last Station""--oh, what a great movie experience. It has superb acting, a fascinating story, stunning cinematography, and the evocation of a period in history. Leo Tolstoy, Russia's greatest novelist, espoused many ideas and spiritual principles in his later life which formed the Tolstoyan movement. Christopher Plummer is magnificent as Tolstoy in his last days, and Helen Mirren, is, as usual, truly memorable. A battle is going on in the film between Mirren as the Countess wife of Tolstoy versus Paul Giametti, at his nastiest, playing the head of the Tolstoyan movement. He wants the copyrights to the master's works to go to the Russian people, while she wants the rights to go to her and the family.
 She hectors her husband not to give in to Giamatti and deny the family the income from his work. It's a titanic struggle among Plummer, Mirren, and Giamatti that forms the basis for the story. The Tolstoys have been married for forty-three years and have had a number of children. Even though Tolstoy dressed in peasant garb, they still lived a privileged life with many servants.
 Giamatti gets a Tolstoy disciple, played with great skill and artistry by actor James McAvoy to become Tolstoy's secretary and spy on the wife. Celibacy is one of the guiding principles of the movement, but on the commune he quickly falls for a young woman and forgoes his vow. Mirren walks a thin line, avoiding shrewishness in her battle, and showing her true love for her husband. Their love scenes together show true chemistry. The rooster and hen scene is great fun.
 One of the outstanding features of the movie is the way it photographically recreates life in the first decade of the twentieth century on a Russian country estate and the life and work of the many peasants who endured lives of quiet desperation in Czarist Russia. In every outdoor scene you see the serfs toiling in large numbers.
 It's a love story in which a woman's struggles for family equity get entangled with the fanaticism of an ideology. The movie's title will become apparent at the end. It's an antidote to all of the action movies and drivel out there. What shines through in all the characters is their deep humanity and their depths of emotion. It's a superior film, very satisfying and enriching.",1266710400,66,2281,4.841025641025641

The movie mentions ""love"" as main theme in Tolstoy's teaching and this statement already contains two errors. First error - which ""love"" does movie refer to? How producers could cherry-pick this one word and twist it to focus only on orgies and other carnal bodily cravings, while Tolstoy taught about love and kindness between all people, with God as connecting force in between us.
Second error  why did they call it Tolstoys teaching at all? As Tolstoy explained many times, this teaching wasn't his invention  it is a pure teaching of Jesus Christ, - the very real Truth about the design of our souls which if we don't understand, we get sick and suffer unavoidably.
Obviously, Hollywood attempts to defame Tolstoys true heritage (not War and Peace) and derail people away from the Truth - Leo Tolstoy went alone against corrupted, twisted society and churches, and remains dangerous for elites!
Many facts from his life were twisted in the movie. For example, why his wife is shown so crazy neurotic like shes possessed by demons? Where did the producers take this information? And how could they lie on Tolstoy being against sexual relationships between husbands and wives  he never was! Tolstoy only reiterated Jesuss teaching which included warning against harms of chaotic, out of marriage, sexual connections and explained why. Producers just ripped that out of context.
Please instead of believing these lies, just read Tolstoy for yourself. To understand his point of view in brief, you can read My Reply to the Synod by Leo Tolstoy, or in more details his wonderful works A Confession, My Religion (What I Believe), and The Four Gospels Harmonized And Translated (the most true meaning of the Bible he personally translated).
