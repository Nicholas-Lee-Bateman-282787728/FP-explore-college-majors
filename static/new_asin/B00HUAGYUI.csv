6208336,2,B00HUAGYUI,It is not about art it is more about religion and too much talking,1428796800,,66,3.7857142857142856
6208337,5,B00HUAGYUI,This is an excellent introduction and explanation of Islamic art.,1426896000,,65,5.6
6208338,5,B00HUAGYUI,"Provides an intelligent academic insight into the history of what can and cannot be represented (either 2D or 3D) in Islam. Especially appropriate given Charlie Hebdo incident and again, as history has shown, a lack of access to eduction for all to often leads to mistakes with consequences.

The Qur'an doesn't speak directly to representation of Muhammad, scribes, angels, prophets or clerics, but only of idolatry (think opposite of Catholicism) and over the past 1400 years there have been lengthy periods when representation was acceptable and periods when even representation of any life form was not acceptable.",1421539200,2,618,5.371134020618556
6208339,5,B00HUAGYUI,"The documentary was extremely informative, explaining the three foundations of Islamic art-geometry, Arabesque design, and calligraphy-while showing how Islamic artists have been faithful to the Hadith or practice of many Muslim traditions of not displaying any realistic representation of the Prophet Muhammad or any of the earlier prophets. At a time, when Islam is so misunderstood by most people in the West, it is instructive to have a source like this documentary to allow Westerners to better understand and respect the sensitivity of Muslims to artistic representations of their religion.",1420675200,,596,5.633333333333334
6208340,5,B00HUAGYUI,"Raheh Omaar does it again in this personalized narrative that takes a deeper look at what can be literally put down, from an artists point of view, of the Koran.  I would prefer that we had more information on the geometric and mathematical aspects of this sacred art, but Rageh and the team did their best to bring us the a modern view of ancient traditions.",1413504000,2,359,4.4393939393939394
8635807,5,B00HUAGYUI,Yes meet expectations,1469491200,,21,6.333333333333333
8635808,4,B00HUAGYUI,Streaming had problems.,1463443200,,23,7.0
8635809,3,B00HUAGYUI,"I enjoyed how since the artists couldn't represent any of their religious work with people, that they resorted to other means, such as nature which came in the form of plants with arabesque stylings, as well as the precise and repetitive nature of geometry. At the same time I like how today's artists employ the use of these principles with more modernistic stylings as well.",1446336000,,376,4.8
8635810,3,B00HUAGYUI,Very interesting,1439164800,,16,7.5
8635811,5,B00HUAGYUI,very informative.,1436400000,,17,8.0
8635812,4,B00HUAGYUI,Great documentary,1435968000,,17,8.0
8635813,3,B00HUAGYUI,"Pretty informative for the most part, but I wish the host had refrained from exiting the frame every time he wanted to make a point. Or maybe I should blame the director for that.",1432857600,,179,4.294117647058823
8635814,1,B00HUAGYUI,A smidgen of interesting content; mostly pseudo-intellectual bulls*** with an agenda.,1431388800,,85,6.818181818181818
8635815,5,B00HUAGYUI,"This is more like a guided meditation on modern art in Islam than a documentary. Rageh Omaar delivers a brilliant narrative that sweeps the viewer through the backbone and heritage of Islamic guidelines around the depictions of figures and images in religious illustrations to what we see now in art of the Islamic world today with Muslim artists from all over the globe. It's a great companion piece to ""The Life of Muhammad"" which is also narrated by Omaar and produced by PBS in a three-part series.",1431302400,,502,4.781609195402299
8635816,4,B00HUAGYUI,An amazing exploration to better understand this culture's art.  Really is beautiful when you understand why it was created and how it has evolved into what we see today.,1429488000,,170,4.862068965517241
