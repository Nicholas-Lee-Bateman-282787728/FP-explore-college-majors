8323309,4,B001N7RRVY,"I sympathize with the disappointment other reviewers have noted concerning picture and sound quality.  The music, however, is transcendently beautiful, the spirit of the presentation ""joyful and triumphant"", tender and holy, spirited and lovely.  If you love the music of Christmas and admire Pavarotti, you will love this disc.  When his voice soars over the assembled orchestra and chorus for ""natum videte"" in ""Adeste Fideles"", I am thrilled.  This is what music is for--to express the spirit reaching toward the divine.  The arrangements are excellent, and the performance as a whole builds to a magnificent climax.  If not for the admittedly mediocre visual quality and the just-passable sound quality, I would give it five stars.",1471132800,,735,5.3478260869565215
8323310,3,B001N7RRVY,"The quality of the CD was pretty poor but the music was perfectly Christmas and performed as only Pavarotti could do it. It contains my favourite ever Christmas carol, Gesu Bambino. No other version of this timeless masterpiece is as good as this one.",1344988800,,251,4.7272727272727275
8323311,4,B001N7RRVY,"My son loves this DVD of vintage Pavarotti. The picture quality is passable at best, but I bought it for the music anyway, and I am happy with it.",1343088000,,146,4.068965517241379
8323312,1,B001N7RRVY,"We had this on VHS and were very disappointed in the video and audio quality.  When we saw it came out on DVD, we expected an improvement in quality, however, it was just as bad.  Even worse was the camera filming all the beauty of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Montreal with the picture looking so poor.  The audio was no better.  A travesty.",1232064000,5,341,4.28125
8323313,1,B001N7RRVY,"I remember this performance from when it was broadcast on public television in the 1980's.  It showed Pavarotti in a time before stadium concerts, before the three tenors, before he was more famous for being Pavarotti than for being a really good singer.

However, this DVD is of such POOR quality that it is almost laughable.  They have taken a video that looks like it is third generation and transfered it to DVD.  They have intercut present day footage into the performance to make you TRY to forget what an awful video it is.  And adding insult to injury there are no track markers so you are stuck trying to fast forward through the whole thing.

Apparently there is another version of this on the Analekta label....let us hope it is of better quality!",1163203200,6,758,4.619402985074627
