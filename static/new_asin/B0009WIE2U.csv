After finally reading his introduction, I found the film absorbing and satisfying. Rossellini's objective was, briefly, to bring St. Francis, his beliefs and his enviornment to us as he believes they really were without acceding to preconceptions. And he does it with his usual brillance.  Finally, there is an interview with his daughter, Isabella, which is worth the price of the DVD.

2327435,1,B0009WIE2U,"I don't know what other commentators see in this film. Compared to other movies of St. Francis, 'Francesco' for example, this movie is terrible. First of all, the acting is horrible. Second, the ""Flowers"" of Saint Francis that come out in the movie are fruitless when compared to other more subsantial themes from the book. The movie doesn't even develop the 'flowers' (stories) well. St. Francis is not even depicted as the humble saint he was, but rather, more like God himself. St. Clare is inserted in the film in a very odd and abrupt way, saying nothing but a prayer in mass. Also, the movie deals with nothing of St. Francis' pre-saint phase (granted, the book doesn't either). I can go on and on about how this movie is bad. Buy Francesco instead and learn more about St. Francis.",1146355200,7,788,4.635714285714286
2327436,5,B0009WIE2U,"Roberto Rossellini was moved by his concern with the cynicism and despair of postwar Europe. His Saint Francis offers an answer of old-fashioned simplicity and innocence to counteract the slyness and cunning of modern world (paraphrasing the booklet). It's an idealistic film. A film of vulnerable and unashamed idealism -like his monks-.

This film was doomed to be misunderstood, if not dismissed as retrograde in its values, or simply ignored. But Christian values don't cease to exist just because we don't see them practised on the silly box. The evidence is that Rossellini has put them in front of our modern eyes and they still make the same impression on us: they are the right -righteous- values. Times don't change, just as values don't change, only the will of the people to accept or deny them.

The question we face in this movie is: How do we apply these values of innocence, purity, unselfishness, meekness, and charity to modern times? Do they change with the times or do they mean the same as they did in the 13th century? Evidently it's us who have changed not the concepts. Why? Because watching this film Rossellini has made us identify with the Franciscan monks, with their unselfish love and innocence; he has made us see the world -even though a long gone world- with our present day eyes and we have -hopefully most of us- identified with them.

Why aren't there any more people like them today? I think there are. If only they would make movies about them. If at least we agree that those Christian values shown to us in the film are good, immutable and worthy to be pursued yesterday as much as today, we have a premise to work with. Then, the next step would be to conclude that pursuing those values are the right and laudable thing to do; at least to try to do. But on the contrary, we distance ourselves more and more from the ideal using all kinds of childish excuses: it's retrograde, old-fashioned, un-realistic and many other things.

That an ideal is hard to achieve does not make it inadequate. On the contrary, we should strive harder to pursue that ideal. Once -long time ago- it was easy to be poor, to walk barefoot in the mud or in the rain, to sleep on dirt floors in the open, to give everything you had to another person because you had so little that you could -God willing- get it back some time soon. And now, when we have so much, we give so little. How much love can we afford to give away once we've given it to our families, our most intimate friends and ourselves? Not much, the tip. How much stuff can we afford to give away once we have satisfied our lust, materialism and greed and that of our loved ones? Not much, the tip. However today we have much more than yesterday; shouldn't we be giving more too? This film leaves a sad impression of our drifting more and more away from our purpose driven lives.

It teaches by contrast. The message is as clear as Jesus' parables for those who want to understand them. If you laugh at it then you are the laughable. 'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.'",1126310400,49,3073,4.51978417266187

The poor fellows live a sort of outlaw-life in the countryside and get into conflicts with law, while trying to live a real life of praticed christianity. While the naive followers create a big mess in transferring their belief into everyday-survival-struggles without money, it needs the wisdom, good will and humour of Francis, who alsways find a spiritual solution to the problems that occur. Therefore the black and white film is divided into episodes that respresent the legends of Francis, who appears as a modern and practical thinking man and teaches us, that it is the humour and not the dogma, that creates real and worthy charity.

2327476,4,B0009WIE2U,"The Flowers of St. Francis is not a bio-pic of that most popular saint of the Medieval Ages. It is a collection of vignettes just after Pope Innocent III's blessing and acknowledging Francis's fledgling order. In the opening sequence, Francis and his monks return from Rome to Rivotorio in a soaking rain. They discuss a bit of the spirituality of the order and their purpose. About ten other short, barely connected stories follow, showing Francis and his early followers in action.

The blend of comedy and seriousness leans over on the comic side, which is not a flaw. The movie examines the spirituality of Francis which leads to a way of life absurd by typical secular standards. Francis follows and hugs a leper. His monks gather hundreds of flowers to make a sweet smelling carpet when St. Clair comes to visit. A sick monk wishes for a pork leg to eat and another monk goes to a herd of swine asking, ""Brother Pig, will you let me have your leg?"" An authentic Christian life leads not only to a radical conversion for the self but also to a new worldview and way of dealing with others, including the natural world. The movie expresses the Franciscan charism and the monks' joy in living this radical life quite well.

Part of the success of the film is Rossellini's use of actual Franciscan monks to play Francis and his followers. The film's style is very natural and realistic which heightens the contrast of their lives to the rest of the world.

If you are looking for a biography of Francis or a plot-driven narrative from his life, this movie is not for you. But if you want a glimpse into the Christian life through a Franciscan lens, this movie delivers the goods. I recommend it highly.",1395792000,,1704,4.617161716171617

The ""natural"" performances by the men portraying the friars who were disciples of the peace loving St. Francis for whom the ""sowing the seeds of peace"" was received in divine connection with God, were actual monks! Amazing.

2327479,4,B0009WIE2U,"Actually the first film I've ever seen by Roberto Rossellini, The Flowers of St. Francis is the sweet biopic of sorts about St. Francis of Assisi and his followers (or flowers, if you will).

It is told in a serious of interesting, sometimes humorous, vignettes, such as St. Francis meeting a leper in the countryside, and the antics of the Saint's followers. It is actually very interesting to see what their lives were like during this time period, showing their charity work and collaborations with St. Mary of the Angels and her respective followers.

It is almost more the story of these disciples, particularly Brother Ginepro, than of Francis himself. We don't see him go through the typical hero's journey of growth and redemption. We do, however, see his followers learn how to effectively embody and teach the word of Christ, making this more ""their"" movie in my opinion.

While engaging, The Flowers of St. Francis does not carry emotional poignancy until the very end; when St. Francis bids his followers goodbye and instructs them to go forth and preach, it is a very moving and inspiring moment to see his disciples, excited yet scared, work on behalf of not just their Lord, but also the Saint and man they admire so much.

It might be my Catholic upbringing talking, but The Flowers of St. Francis is an informative, surprisingly unpretentious, and truly heartwarming portrait of the People's Saint.",1375574400,,1415,4.907949790794979

""Hello, Jeff. I just gave you a helpful vote because your review was insightful. I simply don't understand the negative votes.
I have read several biographies of Saint Francis (Chesterton, Kazantzakis) and think he is one of the most extraordinary saints. It does not appear that Rossellini has done justice to him...
Best regards.""

If you liked this movie that's fine.  But please at least READ my review before voting!  This is a well thought out, carefully written review, that might be helpful to people who actually admire or appreciate Saint Francis!!

After seeing THE MACHINE THAT KILLS BAD PEOPLE (also by Roberto Rossellini), plus THE MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA (1952) and THE ROBE all in the last 2 weeks, and all great films, each one very enjoyable... I was in the mood for another spiritual adventure, and was really hoping to like this one, especially since Saint Francis has always been my favorite Saint, but I just did not feel this was a well made movie.

The sweetness and love that Saint Francis had for all living things seemed to be totally lost on this movie.  In one scene, one of his followers (who may have been a simpleton) CUTS OFF the foot of a pig while it's ALIVE and even after it SCREAMS in PAIN for quite some time, St. Francis tells the monk who did it to go make penance to the FARMER who owns the pig, but doesn't really tell him it was wrong to harm one of God's creatures!!  This may have happened because St. Francis was showing the monk unconditional love, but I was still appalled.  I thought the most important thing about Saint Francis was his love for animals, and that he would have at least told the monk not to do anything like that again.  And now that I know that is the way it happened in the book, I just wish they would have left the whole scene out of the movie.

In another scene he almost angrily tells the birds that are gathering around him to be quiet so he can pray. It's not really funny, and he's not sweet about it. It's just sort of awkward and wrong.

One of the biggest problems with this movie though, is that THERE IS NO BACKGROUND OF ST. FRANCIS IN THIS MOVIE.  It starts when his group of monks is wandering around in the rain looking for shelter.  How and why did Saint Francis become a monk?  This movie will never tell you.

Instead of a story, this movie is merely a series of vignettes with no connection to one another.  There is no flow.  If it were more authentic, then it would have been much more interesting and enjoyable, but it just does not feel authentic at all.

Another thing: I always thought Saint Francis was a slender man with a long face.  That's the way he looks in the older paintings. And they even say in the movie that he's not handsome, but the actor who plays Saint Francis in this movie is definitely a good looking, masculine Italian with a Round Face.  I don't know about you, but I cannot get comfortable with one of my favorite Saints being this handsome and sexy looking. It just does not work.

Also, I'm sure that the fellow Monks of Saint Francis were obedient (if he was indeed their leader), but would he have really said, ""I command you"" to do this, and ""I command you"" to do that... He was a Saint, not a dictator.

Ultimately, this movie does not tell the history of St. Francis as a young man, and it may not tell the true story of St. Francis.  It does not ""Feel"" right on so many levels. And it's just insulting to the intelligence of people who are interested in seeing a true depiction of the life of one group of monks who gave up worldly things for a Spiritual Life, and their enlightened leader.

Since Saint Francis lived 1182 to 1226, HOW do we know that the books that this movie is based on got anything right?  We do know that people were still greatly exaggerating stories in the 1800s.",1365033600,8,3863,4.3767507002801125
2327481,2,B0009WIE2U,"very conflicting views of St. Francis's principles as told in these disjointed vignettes... extremely amateurish portrayal of a pivotal figure in catholic history... how can you be so pious but go cut off a nearby farmers pigs foot when the fasting friar practically on his death bed lifts his nose at the lovingly prepared soup cooked for him? why does Francis request that they begin any preaching with I really have nothing to say????  why do they go begging all the time just to survive, live in the wilderness, and expect people who work for a living to support their carefree lifestyle when they didn't really appear to help anyone except to praise each other, very confusing to me as a catholic...  in my attempts for a few take away precious messages I even found the attempt to define pure happiness a dissapointment, have someone deny you alms in a rage and you compose yourself and not give up?? sounds like Donald Trump!  Fellini's input to this supposedly pious subject was just trashed with the vaudvillian Nicolai (sp?) the barbarian interaction with Genipro, felt so bad for this guy being thrown around like a clown, and I surmise this represents the impressive triumph of the vignettes b/c it affected many to abandon the seige... Sr. Claire was stunningly beautiful and all you wondered was why someone like that would chose such an austere life, bad casting all around if you are serious about conveying a compelling message, perhaps I missed the whole point, this was a comedy about a saint... shameful...  recommend for a weak portrayal of humility, love of God, and one man's influence in a millenium old world, the meek inherit the earth?... they have to, er, marry at least Roberto!",1363996800,4,1707,4.815699658703072

2327483,5,B0009WIE2U,"This is, in my opinion, the best movie on St. Francis yet produced because it captures the spirit of the early friars. Francis wanted to be a brother and that is how he is seen in this movie. The joy. simplicity, and fraternal character of the brothers is captured in this film. The film does not attempt to be a full life of St. Francis but rather aims to capture the Franciscan spirit which it does very well. My only objection was that Francis himself seemed sappy in this film, but I believe that was a product of the era in which this was produced. The saint had to be other-worldly, seemingly on a different plane. The more believable incident of Francis was him rushing up a staircase to ask for alms and then being beaten by a man who didn't want to give them. This was Francis's perfect joy. The enthusiasm in which he and his fellow friar Leo headed straight into what they thought might be a thrashing is true to the character of both men and overcame the sappy Francis shown preaching to the birds. Francis was anything but sappy. Get this movie if you want to know what Franciscanism is all about.",1360454400,2,1110,4.393203883495145

The ancient books upon which ""Flowers of St. Francis"" is based are mostly fantastic stories of Francesco and the early Franciscans; they are not rigorous biography.  Rosselini didn't want to focus on St. Francis but instead on how Francis' teachings were absorbed by others - especially the uneducated countryfolk who were his Franciscans. The movie is a stream of parables. The actors are mostly non-actors.

Rosselini wrote: ""I never meant to re-create the life of the saint ... I don't deal with either his birth or his death ... I have given particular emphasis to Brother Ginapro and Brother Giovanni, who display in an almost paradoxical way the sense of simplicity, innocence, and delight that emanates from Francis' own spirit. In short, as the title indicates, my film wants to focus on the merrier aspect of the Franciscan experience, on the playfulness, the 'perfect delight', the freedom the spirit finds in poverty and in an absolute detachment from material things.""

I have no expertise on various types and qualities of films, cameras etc. that go into movie making so I can't explain why the quality is so primitive looking.  Perhaps Roberto Rossilini  deliberately gave it this quality to give it more authenticity and depth?  A spareness  that would have appealed to St. Francis? He obviously chose b&w to emphasize what he was sharing about this beloved saint.  As to the film itself, it has a lightness and humor that is absolutely brilliant!  Each segment, prefaced with an amusing title of what's to come, is composed of memorable moments of Saint Francis & his eleven fellow monks during their early years  at the deserted lazar (leper) house of Rivo Torto near Assisi. This was a very informal existence and they spent most of their time wandering the hills of Umbria spreading the gospel and showing Christ's love in all they said and did.  A haunting moment __Francis was woken from sleep and hearing the ringing of bells he creeps through the dark where he spied a  leper walking completely alone and forsaken. St. Francis was repulsed yet felt such sympathy and love that he forced himself to hug the man...then you could feel his repugnance turn to love as he fully embraced the poor lost soul.  Who among us could have done it?  Clad in a rough garments, barefooted, following Christ's example, Francis and his followers chose never to be ordained priests and the community lived as ""lesser brothers,"" fratres minores.  The fraternity and fun of these men permeates the film, but also shows the very serious side of their commitment to the saving of souls. The movie is never preachy (it's all in Italian anyway) but the actor playing St. Francis brought such subtlety and humility that it brought the film to life, as did the performances of all his fellow actors. (I detest the word 'stars' in regard to  actors)  The film ended when the brothers followed St' Francis' dictum to go out into all the world and spread the good news.  Even that was humorous, as he has the men all spin and whatever direction they fell in was the way they were to go preaching. This film was a work of love, and brought what could have been rather hackneyed, as is often the case when dealing with someone famous or held in great awe, to a vivid and authentic portrayal...on two levels, as a movie it was funny and entertaining, as a religious biography it was tender and truthful and reverent.",1330128000,2,2510,4.655328798185941

2327507,5,B0009WIE2U,"One of the Vatican's favorite films (though that in itself perhaps doesn't mean much anymore), ""The Flowers of St. Francis"" is a 1950 meditative film by Rossellini, who worked with Fellini on this near-transcendent motion picture. No one I know has seen this; less manage to sit through the entire thing (even though its only 87 minutes long), but this is not supposed to be an action-packed adventure. Instead, it's a quiet, simple tale of monks and their beliefs steeped in divine love for the Infinite, and is divided into heartwarming little vignettes. While St. Francis is indeed the focus of the film, it also pays loving attention to his disciples, most notably Brother Ginepro, and the actor who plays this role deserves special mention.

A lot is written about St. Francis (who lived during the 1200s), and he is a personal source of inspiration for all of us who are spiritually inclined, only because he was patron saint of nature, and strived to teach his disciples about the essence of the Bible rather than blindly following its' tenets. His disciples were often simple-minded, almost always not well-educated, but they had hearts of gold, and the director focuses on this aspect of their lives more than anything else. Filmed in black and white and presented beautifully by the Criterion Collection, this is indeed one of their Top 10 releases ever. Sadly, I suppose, this film is wrongly considered `boring' by mainstream audiences who cant muster up the patience to sit through a work of this nature.

The vignettes here are all from the famed St. Francis book - little allegorical tales from various parts of his life. Most of them concern him and his monks' fervent belief that divine love conquers all - even to the extent of sacrificing their own physical well-being for the concept. Its interesting to see these monks actually practice this concept at such bizarre extremes - subjecting themselves to physical abuse & being  violated in a variety of forms - but then this seems to gratify them as proof of Gods existence and love for all beings on earth. Also touched upon in spades is St. Francis' special love of his environment - with focus on his enlightened approach to birds, animals, and plants.

Rossellini's genius lay in the fact that all of the actors who play the monks were actual Franciscan monks from rural Italy! There is a certain joy and innocence in their eyes that is absolutely impossible to achieve with a jaded real-life actor. Consider the scene when young brother Ginepro is confronted by a tyrant, who is eventually mesmerized by the purity in his eyes. The monk who plays Ginepro is flawless, and a film scholar who narrates a video commentary in the Special Features section rates this actors' performance as one of the best performances in Italian cinematic history. I would have to agree. There is a mood of joy, simple refinement, nobility, happiness and relaxed happiness that is present in every frame of this film - be it the classic shots of the monks running in the rain, or strolling down a hilly meadow. At times, there is `not much going on', but that's the very point!

The film ends with one of the most classic St. Francis tales - where his disciples ask him for direction - and he asks them all to spin around in circles wherever they might stand; and when they fall down, they must travel the direction to which their bodies point. They divest themselves of all food or nourishment, and each monk travels in a different direction without question, with the sole purpose of spreading the message of Gods' love, without the slightest thought of their own comfort or safety, or physical needs. A fascinating concept - but this has also been documented as fact, which only proves that people back then had a certain grasp on things that present day societies might find very hard to comprehend. There is a highly charged segment where a monk approaches a leper (considered an outcast and untouchable) and proceeds to embrace him, as he believes that Gods love is for all. It's a short scene - filmed at night under the stars - but serves as the backbone for the message of the entire picture.

The Special Features section have been well compiled by Criterion. The best is Isabella Rossellini talking about her father and explaining his work with both Ingrid Bergman and Fellini. Its interesting to watch the daughter explain this film as it even predates her, but she seems in awe of his work. Her understanding of the workings of his mind is riveting - only because there is probably no one else alive today who could give us as much insight on Rossellini's work. The other commentaries are by two Italian scholars who dissect the film and the era - not especially eye-opening, but a good addition to the section nonetheless. The American release of this film had an English language introduction that explained the basis of the film (which was deleted for European audiences), and this lost reel is presented here as well.

As a DVD, this isn't as heavy on the extras as say ""Children of Paradise"" or even ""The Rules of the Game"". The extras are light. But I consider them unessential only because the film itself stands so well on its own, it doesn't need any extra propping. It's a clean, straight film with very little doubt in it. I also respected the fact that Rossellini isn't trying to promote any specific religion here - rather, it's an honest attempt at documenting a simpler time in spiritual history when people believed more in a divine presence than they do these days. If anything, this might only serve to increase awareness about the wondrous St. Francis and his merry band of disciples, all of whom were true men of God.

Five Stars. One of the best films of all time.",1296432000,10,5751,4.7382617382617385

-- G.K. Chesterton, ""St. Francis of Assisi""

""The Flowers of St. Francis"" is a lovely little film directed by the great Italian neo-realist, Roberto Rossellini, and co-written by Federico Fellini. A collaboration between Italian cinema's most famous neo-realist and its most famous surrealist should pique the curiosity of any cinephile, while devotees of St. Francis, arguably the Church's most enduringly popular saint, will find much to enjoy in this simple, touching film.

Told in a series of vignettes that echo Christ's parables, ""The Flowers of St. Francis"" captures something of the whimsy of Francis' ministry. He remains one of the most accessible and benevolent of the long litany saints in the Catholic tradition, at least in part because Francis felt the joy of faith, even in times of trial and hardship. Any movie about a saint's life risks over-piety, turning a human person into a sacrosanct object, as if the saint's blinding halo casts in shadow any individual features. That's certainly not how Francis saw himself, and it's not how he's portrayed in the film. Rossellini and Fellini approach their subject with love, which is not exactly the same as reverence. The brothers (who were all played by members of the Franciscan order) laugh, make fools of themselves, joke with each other -- but the effect is always familial, always in the spirit of love and charity.

There are moments of darkness and light in ""The Flowers of St. Francis,"" a narrative chiaroscuro that reflects the constant struggle and tension of modeling one's life on Christ. There are sequences of physical comedy (poor Brother Ginepro being tossed around like a rag doll by a band of marauders) that wouldn't seem out-of-place in a Chaplin film. Then there are passages of powerful simplicity and pathos, such as Francis'  encounter with a leper in a desolate field on a dark night, that remind the viewer that love must first conquer fear. Faith is alive in this film, and it's not always easy. Francis, with grace and love, praised God by praising His creation (he's the patron saint of the environment, after all!). This film, like the subject that inspired it, feels like the fruit of that love.

Martin Scorsese, no cinematic lightweight, wrote an insightful ""personal appreciation"" for the 2005 DVD release of ""The Flowers of St. Francis."" I'll let il maestro speak, as he is a more reliable authority than yours truly:

""What Rossellini did, with such grace and such apparent ease, was to make a movie about a group of men for whom existence is a neverending struggle -- a struggle to be good, a struggle to stay true to the word of God. At times, the struggle becomes comic, and I still marvel at Rossellini's daring in these scenes -- the way Francis and his brethren jump through the puddles, or the cooking of the soup, which wouldn't be out of place in a Laurel and Hardy short. Of course, it's all done in a very loving  manner, and that's why it is at once so magical and so true.

2327510,4,B0009WIE2U,"Rossellini's Francesco, Guillare di Dio/Francis, God's Jester (aka The Flowers of St francis) is less political than Pasolini's Gospel According to St. Matthew, but it's still possible to see it as one of its antecedents with its use of amateur actors and avoidance of studio work. Its anecdotal narrative doesn't always work (the sequence with the tyrant is amusing but too broadly played, for example), but it does build up a picture of an alternative, more open-spirited approach to religious devotion more in tune with nature than scripture, and the ending is both funny and quietly touching, as Francesco's followers spin round and round in circles until dizzy to find which path God wants them to follow.",1196899200,,710,5.076923076923077
2327511,5,B0009WIE2U,"Rossellini is an extraordinary director (for a good introduction to his work see M. Scorsese's, My Voyage to Italy) His treatment of St. Francis is unlike any other screen version I have seen, and in my view, irreplaceable. It is based on ""I Fioretti"" very early collection of stories that grew up among the first followers and is really more about the effect Francis had on them than  it is a ""biography"" of the saint. It  that way it is more like a ""gospel,"" an excited, almost unbelievable, account of how he changed people's lives. It is not the place to go to get the basic facts, but if you want to get right to the ""truth"" of this person who changed western culture fundamentally, then this might well be the place to go. For a very effective contemporary retelling of some the Fioretti stories, try Murray Bodo's Tales of St. Francis. The film is also a great display of Rossellini's revolutionary cinematic realism. A real classic. Enjoy!
P.S. after writing this I read the other reviews. They make clear the range of possible reaction both on the human level and the artistic. I don't have any quarrel with (almost) any of them. I would just say that there is a great deal going on here regarding both the person and film, so if you are just getting acquainted with either aspect, look around a bit before making up your mind for yourself.",1194998400,11,1349,4.5473251028806585
2327512,4,B0009WIE2U,i love the story of st francis.. This is a fine black and white movie - one of Rossellini's better films of the period.. While it is not quite as powerful as 'Open City' it is a very important movie and deserves to be seen..,1169942400,,224,4.0
2327513,1,B0009WIE2U,"This movie is a disaster.

It does not cover the conversion of St. Francis, since it begins after the Pope has allowed him to found the order.  It does not present what his principles were, other than to care for the poor.  Poverty (his own) and simplicity are barely present, and then handled badly with unseemly inconsistencies.  At one point, Francis even praises his own humility.  That's not very humble as far as I'm concerned.

It would seem that Francis was actually quite an inspiration to his brethren, but in this film he is a stern, distant, unfeeling father figure.  He gives commands which are frequently disobeyed without any remorse.  Even though Francis himself is reputed to have run through the streets stark naked to show his disassociation from the material world, he is appalled at one of the brothers who gives away his cloak to the poor and returns shirtless.

Many films portray Jesus as a relatively distant person, withdrawn, often emotion-less and passive.  Francis gets this kind of portrayal in this film.  In fact, the only character to which one can relate is Brother Ginepro (forgive spelling please).  The final scene emphasizes the treatment of Francis as Jesus in an over-obvious and almost silly allegory for ""Go into all the world and preach the gospel"" which in the Gospels was followed by Jesus' ascension.  In reality, Francis knew he was a flawed, repentant sinner, saved by God's grace into a life of simple happiness and good works, not an error-free Christ-figure.

The setting is not redeeming.  The brothers live in little stone huts, from which they emerge only on certain occasions, acting much like a bunch of chicks in a chicken yard.  Though the Church calls the order ""beggars"", these beggars are more persistent and more obnoxious than any present-day street beggars.  They seldom have anything to give to the poor, so they go out and badger reticent donors and then give only some of their receipts to the poor.  Very much NOT what St. Francis was about.

The scene with the tyrant appears to have been dropped in from some other movie, and its point is far from clear.  It is not at all apparent what it has to do with St. Francis and his teachings.

Though not a five-star movie in itself, Brother Sun, Sister Moon is a much better production than this.  By comparison it is marvelous.",1158969600,14,2342,4.77363184079602

8068256,5,B0009WIE2U,"Far and away the best film on the life of a saint. Not a straightforward biography but a series of vignettes, taken mostly from the medieval classic The Little Flowers of St. Francis. The saint and his early companions are played brilliantly but simply by real Franciscan friars. Brother Ginepro (Juniper) and Giovanni (the old man) threaten to steal the show from St. Francis, which I'm sure would delight him. I know it's clich but this is truly a must-see.",1488758400,,459,4.75
8068257,5,B0009WIE2U,"I've considered this my favorite movie for many years; I have others of course.  It is a simple telling of the tale of this great saint; I have just about all the other versions.  They don't bear comparison.  The scene with the leper is heart-breaking and brings tears.  The humor is delightful.  All the performers are real monks except for the fabulous tyrant of course.  It shows the joy of religion.  Francis is my favorite saint.  I discovered him in junior high school when I asked the librarian for a biography.  I have a beautiful statue made in Italy in my garden.  Francis is accepted by all religions, Judaism and Islam included, as the patron saint of the environment.  I pray to him and admire Pope Francis for his assuming the name of Francis.  I feel lucky to be Catholic in this age of the Pope and St. Theresa of Calcutta.",1486512000,2,839,4.483443708609271

8068262,4,B0009WIE2U,"The Flowers of St. Francis is a beautifully shot and elegant film about the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi. The director shows the beautiful Italian countryside so well and uses animals (birds, pigs, etc.) to full effect in this movie to compliment the delicate performances of the leads, who were actual brothers in the Catholic order. That was a very smart decision and the film is a shining example of religious belief in the era of Italian neorealistic filmmaking.",1422057600,,472,4.9125
