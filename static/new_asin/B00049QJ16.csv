2156758,5,B00049QJ16,"My husband recently took my Dad, a World War II veteran, on a trip to Washington D.C. with the ""Honor Flight"" organization to visit the World War II Memorial.  They had an unforgettable trip.  They saw this video on their bus while traveling to and from the various memorials they visited.  This video describes in detail why it took so long for the memorial to be built, and the many obstacles the proponents had to overcome for the memorial to become a reality.  The producers of the video do an exceptional job not only showing the various stages of the building of the memorial itself, but also do a fantastic job of interweaving actual scenes from the war with sacrifices being made by civilians at home, especially the women.  A truly inspirational film for all ages.",1375401600,,773,4.654411764705882
2156759,5,B00049QJ16,"Us old jar heads from WWII really appreciate this memorial to the ""Greatest Generation"" 'cause it covers it all !
Seems like it, though, is like so many worthwhile actions this nation ought to be doing instead of posturing and being
politically correct (what ever that really means).  Where is the patriotism now (except in the military) that we'uns had back
then ?  The DVD does a great job of portraying  the condition of us ALL.  It is in very good condition, tho not like new..
It obviously has caused a lot of hearts to skip a beat as we've remembered those days.  Thanks.

2156764,5,B00049QJ16,"Having seen the WWI Memorial, and met the Congresswoman who championed the idea, as well as one of the creators of the DVD, I was able to hear firsthand how the project was created and built.  As a member of the construction industry for twenty years, I appreciated the intersplicing of construction segments with interviews and journalistic footage from the war era.  This is one of the finest documentaries I've ever seen, in terms of explaining the symbolism of the project as well as its context.  It would be especially useful in demonstrating, to those who did not live through it, what WWI was all about.

8036316,5,B00049QJ16,"This documentary on the WWII Memorial is very well done and was enjoyable to watch. It is narrated by the late Tim Russert.  The film alternates between explaining how the memorial was built and a historical overview of WWII, which includes some interviews with veterans.
I think it was really helpful to showcase some of the battles and the tremendous loses the UIS suffered while fighting the war. There are also some film clips on how united the home front was and when women entered the workforce (Rosie the Riveters) to aid in the war effort. In-between Russert adds commentary and explains why the memorial was controversial and very difficult to build.
I had no idea what a huge undertaking it was and how elaborate the design was (I have not see it in person yet). In the end you get to see the memorial in its completed state with throngs of visitors paying respects and honoring all those who contributed to preserving freedom.",1435536000,,937,4.713414634146342
