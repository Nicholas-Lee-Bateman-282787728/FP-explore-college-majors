8662826,2,B00KZJX8JQ,I did not receive this Kaboom DVD with Halloween episodes.  Received instead a Franklin and Friends Trick or Treat which only had one Halloween episode out of 4  Franklin stories.  Also only 45 minutes long.  Was looking forward to several different shows and a much longer running time.,1478476800,,287,4.916666666666667
8662827,5,B00KZJX8JQ,Love the old anime not the new computerized cartoons. This was a great buy and great for the family at a great price. Love the anime.,1478131200,,133,4.153846153846154
8662828,5,B00KZJX8JQ,Appears to be brand new will see how it works when I play it for my kids in school. so far satisfied customer!,1395187200,,110,3.8260869565217392
8662829,3,B00KZJX8JQ,this was a good price but some of the episodes didn't related specifically enough to Halloween.  I'd hoped each episode would focus entirely on Halloween.,1386028800,,154,5.16
8662830,4,B00KZJX8JQ,"Liked the collection, but would have liked them to use the Halloween special for the Berenstain Bears instead of the slumber party one, which we own from a different DVD collection and one other non-halloween B. Bears episode.  Why put these in the selection when a perfectly good halloween episode exists?  The Franklin ones come first on the CD, though, and my daughter liked those well enough to keep it for next Halloween. Lots of shows included.",1385337600,,450,4.8311688311688314
8662831,5,B00KZJX8JQ,Love this collection of movies and my kids do as well. Something a lot more kid friendly to watch at Halloween than most other options.,1354665600,,135,4.44
