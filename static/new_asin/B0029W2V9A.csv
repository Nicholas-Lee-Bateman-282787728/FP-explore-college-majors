3881129,5,B0029W2V9A,"It is not for those looking for a hi quality movie, but I liked it.  I still watch it everyday.",1315008000,,95,3.75
3881130,2,B0029W2V9A,"This movie was terribly done.  I thought the story idea sounded great which was why I rented it but the way in which it was done ruined it.  The editing was terrible, the continuity was even messed up in some jump shots.  This was very amateur.  It seemed like it wasn't looked over enough during the editing.  I also thought there was too much going on and there were scenes that were really unnecessary.  Instead of having all of the unnecessary scenes and situations there could have been more situations they could have went more in depth on.  Then the film would've been much better.",1311638400,,588,4.542857142857143
3881131,1,B0029W2V9A,"This movie is horrible! Bad acting, bad sound, bad singing. No punch-line. Complete mockery of the church. HORRIBLE!!!!! There was so much going on in this movie. I can't believe Laman Rucker attached his name to this garbage.",1282521600,5,226,4.973684210526316
3881132,1,B0029W2V9A,This movie was absolutely horrible.  Horrible acting.  Horrible script.  Horrible music (given the title and the fact that the story is supposed to revolve around a group of black kids and a group of Latino kids who unwillingly join together to form a choir - the horrible music is unforgivable).  Do not waste your time or money on this bomb.  The only bright spot is that it includes a black father who has a strong and loving presence in his child's life.  That's not enough to build this movie on.,1278979200,9,501,4.511111111111111
3881133,3,B0029W2V9A,This movie was ok the acting was not the greatest and the plot was missing something.  Its a movie that everyone can watch but it is definitely low budget and could possibly offend some religious groups (Christian) because of the limited view on Christianity and Women's roles.,1277078400,3,277,4.8936170212765955
3881134,1,B0029W2V9A,"Truly disappointed when I see black people act like this, so amateur.  No story to this play.  makes you so unhappy to have bought this DVD.",1271030400,10,140,4.346153846153846

8358308,3,B0029W2V9A,Would have preferred more dialogue and singers that could really sing.  This was ok,1464739200,,83,4.928571428571429
8358309,5,B0029W2V9A,Love the movie.  Seems to me like everyday life for some woman of God.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.,1462492800,,116,4.2272727272727275
8358310,3,B0029W2V9A,"Good clean movie.  Thoughtful story of reconciliation and redemption, but underdevelopped. Average acting, which surprised me because talent was present and the characterizations are realistic and relatable; however, the acting fell short. I expected the choir's final number to be great and to see the daughter perform an amazing solo.",1457568000,,336,5.72

8358313,3,B0029W2V9A,"acting was poor. I bought it because I recognized the make lead. It has a good story line but is very slow. Never see or hear any ""great song"" or any good music period.",1395360000,2,168,3.9705882352941178
8358314,3,B0029W2V9A,I thought it would have a lot of good singing in it. Turns out the movie title was the leading lady.,1367712000,,100,3.8095238095238093
8358315,5,B0029W2V9A,"This video arrived shortly after i ordered it, and i watched it right away. There are no flaws anywhere. I'll keep my opinions about the movie itself- to myself, but LamMANnnnnn!!!",1332806400,,180,4.838709677419355
