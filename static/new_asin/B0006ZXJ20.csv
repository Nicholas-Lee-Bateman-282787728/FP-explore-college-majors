A must see movie in my book, because it has all the comedy for everyone young or old and a love story which every one can related to. The pace of the movie is very energetic; it's not boring at all! Many different characters you can like and related to for my generation. Also you see many of the characters trying to fit in to a new environment. Never a dull moment in this movie!",1129507200,3,428,4.107142857142857
2198322,4,B0006ZXJ20,"Kal penn plays a cool indian kid who has a rich father and a sports car and lives in a mansion. He's cool, popular and smooth with the ladies. But what happens when his immigrant cousin comes from india and stays in his house and goes to his school?

Then the comedy of ""Dude, wheres the party"" starts.

Negatives-The only thing i didn't like about this DVD has nothing to do with the film it has to do with the quality of the movie. The movie looks very low-budget, and cheaply done and once and a while you will get a crisp picture But for the most part the transfer is horrible.

Positives-Kal penn is hilarious and he plays a good role here as he did in ""harold and kumar go to white castle"".

Funny Scenes!!

In one Scene Kal penn never got along with this one store owner and they always exchange words. But when he visits this girl that he likes house,Her father is the storeowner! and drama ensues.

Conclusion-A pretty good comedy,i really enjoyed it and it's a shame it's only hampered by poor dvd film quality.

4 stars out of 5

2198323,4,B0006ZXJ20,"Dude, Where's The Party is about an Indian boy (Hari Patel) who moves to America to live with his Dad's friend's family. Mohan Bakshi was born in America is basically a rich slacker type who is embarrased by Hari and other FOBs. He doesn't want to hang out with him.

There is are also two cute love stories with both of the guys. The first 10-15 minutes of the movie were slow paced, after that, the movie gets really funny. The soundtrack is great. There are a lot of Indian stereotypes in the movie - like oily hair, being cheap and others - and a lot of them are true!

Unlike Kal Penn's other movies, this movie is not dirty, doesn't have bad words or sexual scenes. You can watch it with kids. This movie is good if you are in the mood for a simple comedy.",1114819200,,762,4.1768707482993195
2198324,5,B0006ZXJ20,"This movie highlights the struggle of an Indian immigrant trying to fit into the American college scene. If you're and immigrant or ever had a relative move to this country (as I did), you're gonna laugh all the way through this. Although this is not a serious movie at all, the main struggle throughout is completely real! If you liked 'Bride and Prejudice', you'll like this movie. Starts off slow and somewhat serious sounding, but then turns into a lotta fun once you realize the director isn't taking the story too seriously.",1111536000,,530,4.771739130434782
2198325,4,B0006ZXJ20,"As watching the first few minutes, i found it a little odd, but after watching and getting into the movie i found it really interesting and witty. The story about an indian immigrant, Hari, arriving to the US, isn't really a new concept it's the terminology that made it intersting...talking about day to day life of young desi's who live abroad and take a lot for granted. It's a great and fun movie, the only way you can judge it is if you watch...=P

P.S.that sri lankan guy in the movie, made a fool of himself as a person and as a sri lankan...",1109894400,,558,4.186915887850467
2198326,3,B0006ZXJ20,"The movie has a simple story line about the dynamics of the growing South Asian community in the US, and the difference that exists between the old immigrants and new immigrants. The fact that this difference or tension is examined in a college setting gives it the funny edge. While the movie was entertaining, there were parts where it lacked that funny edge.

The person who stands out like a star in this movie is Kal Penn of Harold and Kumar fame.

A familiarity with the South Asian community may help in better understanding and appreciating the movie. But, do not let that stop you from watching the movie and see for yourself how geeky South Asian kids are desperately trying to break out of the mold and not become doctors or engineer, but instead be cool dudes!",1109894400,,772,4.586956521739131
2198327,5,B0006ZXJ20,"I absolutely loved this film. I found it very entertaining, fresh and young. There was one particularily cute and talented actor that I hope to see more of...Indy Wijay who played Raju Mathews, I believe he was from Sre Lanka. Great movie and one that will be in the DVD library for years to come.",1109462400,,297,4.418181818181818
2198328,4,B0006ZXJ20,"Don't be fooled by the title.  This isn't your average American teen flick, but an insightfully humorous look at the young Desi (South Asian) community in America.  The story centers around a Fresh off the Boat (FOB) Indian, Hari Patel, who moves to America to attend college while living with his Uncle's family.  Before his journey, a local guru predicts Hari will meet his destined wife in America whose name begins with ""P"" and will fall upon him in a fever during a full moon.  Hari is thrilled about his trip to America and can't wait for his  cousin, played by ""Van Wilder's"" Kal Penn, to introduce him to his hip American friends.

Kal Penn's character does everything in his power to avoid Hari because FOBs like him represent all the un-cool things about his Indian heritage.  They all want to party, but do they party together? And will Hari end up finding his true love?  You'll have to watch and see.",1108857600,11,913,4.592592592592593
2198329,3,B0006ZXJ20,"The first half is a bit slow and extremely cheesy, but the movie has more in common with Monsoon Wedding and Avalon than it does with the typical teenage party film.  It comments on the complacency and dangers of assimilation, when one's respect for one's own culture is diminished.  I really loved it.  Didn't hurt that it was SO like a Bollywood movie (no kissing on the lips here!) and that the music was great.  I would check it out (just don't let the beginning deter you:)",1107475200,,478,4.459770114942529

8044252,5,B0006ZXJ20,This movie is worth watching. It takes another look at a subculture within the United states. la la la la,1401667200,,105,4.3
8044253,5,B0006ZXJ20,The quality of the movie is good. And it got here relatively quickly. The movie is hilarious!! A must have for all Kal Penn fans :),1323216000,,131,4.076923076923077
8044254,5,B0006ZXJ20,"this movie is hilarious for all: friends of fobs, girlfriends of fobs. my ex-husband was a fob and he didn't like it so much. but it's hilarious and has lots of dumb jokes. if you like russel peters and and can appropriate indian jokes, it's the kinda thing you should try. if you don't know anything about indians, don't watch it; you won't understand alot of the inside jokes.",1302393600,,378,4.492753623188406
8044255,3,B0006ZXJ20,"This movie was okay.  But, it did make me a little uncomfortable.  I'm a white american, but I think I have more respect for indian people than american-born indian people seem to.  Just because they were born in India, our american-born indian people treat their own kind like they are ignorant foreigners.  Yes, we all know that indians from India follow stupid religions and religious practices, and their hygiene needs improvement, but these people need patient help from their american-born brothers and sisters. I guess Kal Penn was born in america.  He doesn't ever seem to show his Indian pride.  It seems that he enjoys ridiculing his heritage.

I enjoyed watching this film as I do any indian-oriented film because indian girls are all so beautiful and I'm glad to see them coming to america and living a new life of self-respect and dignity (that is, if their India born parents aren't still insistent on their warped religious practices).

Anyone that meets a FOB (fresh off the boat) from any country (who's entered this country legally and is pursuing an education to enhance their american dream), should be treated with more respect.

This movie has laughs, but the attitudes of some american-born indians is disturbing and not so funny.",1226188800,,1253,4.956937799043062
8044256,4,B0006ZXJ20,"I found this movies good and I enjoyed to see once, but it is not movie that I could see myself watching numerous times. It does strike up good point that are a problem in the south asian community. Married into the asian community, and living in the same city where they filmed this and so many of the actors from here. I can say it is a big issue with the Asian community about their identities. Especially the new generations of Asians being born in the USA. They have the old way and new way hitting them and mostly they choose to be like everyone else and go for the new way. In that they think they are better then other Asian who are new here or choose their culture over fitting in. For this point I think the movie is showing this very well, though a little overboard. In regard to the comedy it is funny at times, but it not hilariously funny. But I think it is worth seeing once.",1219622400,,890,4.1502890173410405
8044257,5,B0006ZXJ20,"I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I am a new fan of Kal Penn's (aka Kalpen Modi), and I came across this film while researching his filmography.  I rented it, and was very surprised to see that it was a genuine snapshot of the assimilation of East Indians into American culture.  I definately relate to this as an African-American, and it was really interesting to watch a film that shared the experiences of a people of Color outside of Blacks and Latinos.  Oh, and Kal was absolutely fabulous (of course).",1191628800,,505,4.640449438202247
8044258,4,B0006ZXJ20,We rented this movie looking for some stupid comedy but this was really fun. Kept us into it the whole time and a generally funny movie. Definitely worth renting.,1170460800,,162,4.620689655172414
8044259,2,B0006ZXJ20,Not the great film youd think from the cover. I've got two words- don't bother. It's mildly funny at times but it's very easy to lose interest. If it's in the 50cent section and you really dotn have anything to do. then yeah why not. but If you're trying to impress a party- stick with Harold and Kumar,1151884800,2,302,4.224137931034483
