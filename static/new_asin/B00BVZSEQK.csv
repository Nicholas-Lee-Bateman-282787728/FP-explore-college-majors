Saif Ali Khan and John Abraham do an amazing job as the leads in this followup film, not to mention the music is a good listen.  I loved the dialogues, in fact I thought it was better than Race.  Am truly glad I got this one, it's the first thriller I have ever bought but I bet will be getting more soon.",1369094400,2,363,3.9452054794520546
5678768,1,B00BVZSEQK,"I ordered this in error - tried to cancel it but was too late.
Not sure why they made a part 2 of such a crappy part 1.
i thought at least they would improve on the second one but it was jsut as bad as the first.
this movie has nothing to offer.",1367625600,,245,3.5555555555555554

8574597,3,B00BVZSEQK,"The 'Bluray' has some issues, the music videos are not in sync with the picture/sound. And it looks like it's a dvd copy to a bluray.
The movie is at times also slighty out of sync audio/picture.....
Too bad because i loved this movie and wanted to own it.",1502150400,,256,4.244897959183674
8574598,5,B00BVZSEQK,Oh Saif wow is all I can say. Both of these race movies have now made me a huge fan . This one was great as good as or better than race one .

8574602,3,B00BVZSEQK,"This movie, while exciting and seemingly fun, is not appropriate for younger views.  It is high in violence and sexual innuendo and subject matter in tales gangsters and unlawful people in general.

We could not get through the first 15 minutes before it became impossible to watch in the same room as children.  Yet, the children were very interested as it moved fast and was exciting.

That being said it will be a good eye candy no substance movie with good songs - good for younger adults.",1378944000,,493,4.632183908045977

8574604,4,B00BVZSEQK,"I was expecting a continuation from Race , not the case. Race 2 is about a race to win. Good actors in this with good music.",1373673600,,124,3.8076923076923075

In my view, Bollywood has always been better at making action movies than romantic ones, which often come across as emotionally simpleminded and cloying, and ""Race 2,"" a sequel to ""Race"" from 2008, is a case in point. Directed by Abbas-Mustan, this high-energy film may be all flash and no substance - but what flash! It tells the story of two high-living international playboys, Armaan (John Abraham) and Ranveer (Saif Ali Khan), whose combined wealth would make Aristotle Onassis green with envy. The two men are locked in a game of mortal combat after Armaan has Ranveer's girlfriend killed. There's even an attempt on the part of the two gazillionaires to steal the Shroud of Turin, no less. If there's one lesson to be gleaned from ""Race 2,"" it's that some people really do have too much time and money on their hands.

But the plotting - which is nearly impossible to follow anyway, what with its double and triple twists and its constantly shifting allegiances - is the least of the attractions of ""Race 2,"" which is so beautifully photographed that it almost doesn't matter what's going on in the foreground of the picture. The pedal-to-the-metal pacing helps to mitigate, to some extent at least, the excessive length of the movie, and the chase and fight sequences are pretty damned spectacular, even if they do strain credibility on a regular basis (there are even blatant rip-offs of ""Speed"" and ""Air Force One"" along the way). The movie also restricts itself to a bare minimum of those annoying song-and-dance numbers that are practically de rigueur in any Bollywood production, though there`s a ferocious cage match scene that ends on too downbeat a note for a film of this frivolous a nature.

There may not be a lot of food for thought in ""Race 2,"" but the movie does provide a feast for the eyes.",1372982400,,1821,4.7746031746031745
8574606,5,B00BVZSEQK,"Like it a lot. I think it was better thatn the first one. Love how they play trying to confuse the audience who the bad ones are. Love John Abraham,  All the characters where well played. Anil Kapoor is very funny.",1371254400,3,214,4.219512195121951
