8091930,3,B000BT96N2,"My 3 Star rating is given in the context of a fan of the B Westerns  of the 1930s and very early 40s. If you are a fan of westerns from all periods or just a casual western fan, chances are you will think my 3 Stars is way off the mark and you wouldnt be wrong. There is a certain charm and fascination with these old movies ,warts and all, that speak to a different time in our history and the history of Hollywood film making via economics and audience/theater owners needs at the time. The Depression was an every day reality and the movie theaters were a refuge for a few hours of escape with a 2d feature film,News of the Week,comedy short,cartoon and ""Coming Attractions"" for the following week (they changed every week) all for .10 to .75 cents. You may have also watched the latest ""cliffhanger"" serial chapter and recieved a free dish for being in the first 25 customers that evening! Quite a number of these Westerns were filmed in a matter of days and rushed out to the theaters. Keep this in mind if you choose to watch these old westerns. (I also get a kick out of checking the shooting locations which were not that far from ""downtown"" Hollywood in those days,also check out those automobiles included in the ""modern"" westerns of those days.)",1361836800,,1256,4.437229437229437
8091931,4,B000BT96N2,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""FARGO EXPRESS"" (20 November 1933) (61 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- . Ken Maynard was an American motion picture stuntman and actor --- Born Kenneth Olin Maynard in Vevay, Indiana, he was an accomplished horseman --- As a young man, he performed in rodeos and was a trick rider with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show and a circus rider with Ringling Brothers --- During World War I, he served in the United States Army.

He first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 and in addition to acting also did stunt work --- Maynard became one of the first singing cowboys with Columbia Records --- Also one of the first to make a star out of his white stallion named ""Tarzan"", a half-Arabian, half-American Saddle horse. Maynard bought him in the mid-1920's --- With his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and pair of six-shooters, from the 1920s to the mid-1940s --- Maynard appeared in more than 90 films --- However, his alcoholism severely impacted his life and his career ended in 1944. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors.

The significant amount of money he had earned vanished and he lived a desolate life in a rundown mobile home --- During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown admirer - long thought to be Gene Autry --- More than 25 years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to two small parts in films in 1970 and 1972 --- Ken Maynard died penniless in 1973 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was interred at Forest Lawn Cypress Cemetery in Cypress, California. Maynard's funeral is described in detail in James Horwitz's book They Went Thataway --- His brother, Kermit Maynard, was also an actor and stuntman

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Ken Maynard has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6751 Hollywood Blvd -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Our story line and plot, Marshals Blackie Weed (Ken Maynard) and Joe Kearney (Lafe McKee) posing as two-gun men, hire on at Markham's ranch --- They are after Tulliver (Tom London) and his gang of rustlers --- But unknown to the two, Tulliver has planted Thorn (Charles King) on the ranch and he kills the foreman Riggs (Walter Perry) and puts the blame on Blackie --- The Two Gun Man is one of the finest westerns produced by low-budget Tiffany Productions. Starring Ken Maynard, the man best known as the cowboy who taught John Wayne how to do his own stunts, The Two Gun Man features plenty of frontier action, from barroom brawls to desert gunfights --- Ken Maynard had been a major star in the 1920's famous for his trick riding and daring subnetwork. Unfortunately he had a few too many personal demons and his career steadily declined during the 1930s. This film is from his final solo starring series. He would re-surface briefly over weight and as nasty as ever in the 40s in Monogram's ""Trail Blazer"" with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele --- After that he basically ""retired"" from the screen.
