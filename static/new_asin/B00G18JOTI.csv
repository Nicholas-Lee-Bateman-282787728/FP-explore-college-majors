8620040,4,B00G18JOTI,"A very touching and human film about the 40 some odd year relationship between one of the greatest directors and greatest actresses of the last hundred years.

This is probably not a ideal film for those not familiar with Bergman and Ullman's work together. The film seems to assume a knowledge of that work, it's depth and importance. It's also not for film scholars looking for insight into either artist's working methods. This 85 minute film is solely about the course of a relationship that started when Ullman was 25 and Bergman 46 (and married), grew into a passionate affair, produced a child, ended up falling apart, only to be reborn in a new way - lasting until Bergman's death in 2007.

A lot of the film is an extended interview with Ullman who is candid, charming, funny and moving. We hear an actor read some of Bergman's letter's to Ullman (a slightly awkward device), but there's no question that the film is her perspective on the experience of a complex relationship between two great, vulnerable and sometimes very neurotic geniuses. There is some interesting occasional use of clips from the films that show how their off screen relationship was clearly influencing the work between them. But if you go in expecting some overview of their great collaborations you'll be disappointed. But as a human story of a love that lasted a lifetime, it's very rewarding.

Note: This film is available as an extra in the recent Criterion blu-ray release of ""Persona""",1409875200,4,1475,4.845238095238095
8620041,5,B00G18JOTI,"If you loved Bergman movies, and if you love films about relationships, this is an extraordinarily touching one.  It's almost like seeing another Ingmar Bergman film, but it's real.",1406246400,,181,5.241379310344827
8620042,5,B00G18JOTI,I was very moved by this documentary about the relationship between Bergman and Ullman. I have always enjoyed his movies and it's a touching tribute to their relationship.,1399680000,,171,5.142857142857143
8620043,5,B00G18JOTI,"This video had the same mystic quality as so much of Ingmar's work, or more likely Liv and Ingmar's work, as this made me realize that she must have had much more influence on his creative side than I realized. It was inspiring-- made me reflect on my own relation with my life partner, my spouse, in a new way.",1396137600,,311,4.2
8620044,4,B00G18JOTI,"Though categorized as a documentary, Liv & Ingmar is more like a Norwegian actress Liv Ullmanns personal memoir of her days with Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. For this film she re-visits Bergmans home on Fr Island, and remembers how their personal relationship started and ended.

Liv & Ingmar consists of interview section where Ullmann talks before the camera, and archive footage with her voiceover reading excerpts from her autobiography Changing, interlaced from letters from Ingmar.

So their relationship that spans more than four decades is recounted from the viewpoint of Liv Ullmann. As you know, Bergman died in 2007 at the age of 89), and no one except Ullmann is interviewed for this film. After all, the film is titled Live & Ingmar, not the other way around.

This is first and foremost a love story, told by the very person who was in it. The strength of the film lies in the words of Liv Ullmann, who describes her off-screen relationship with Bergman (she speaks in English here) in a quiet way. Despite the sentimental soundtrack and insert shots that are unnecessary, Liv & Ingmar is a touching documentary, perhaps even for those who have never seen such classic works as Persona and Scenes from a Marriage.",1395619200,2,1231,4.908653846153846
