8256010,4,B0014LHJ9Y,"BOMBAY TO BANGKOK is a Bollywood product, and it's pretty silly, with plot holes galore and even a musical number. I dunno, maybe I was in a silly mood going into this film, but I happen to like it. But, no doubt, there are gonna be folks who'll feel differently. Ah well, different strokes, as they say.

The plot is this: Shankar Singh (Shreyas Talpade) is a cook in Mumbai who, in one moment of weakness, resorts to thievery. Temptation leads him to seize a pouch full of money, money which turns out to be property of the biggest mafia don in Mumbai. In his frantic attempts to evade the don's goons Shankar passes himself off as a doctor and manages to latch on to a medical group flying out to Thailand on voluntary work. However, somewhere along the way, he ends up misplacing the pouch of money.

In Thailand, Shankar glimpses Jasmine (Lina Christianson), a gorgeous Thai prostitute, and engages her services. But when Shankar becomes too nervous to follow thru, Jasmine returns his money to him (""No happy, no money.""). The next morning, who should show up at the medical relief camp but Jasmine, who it turns out is a daytime volunteer. Shankar and Jasmine begin to spend time together, and, even though the language barrier seems insurmountable, there's something there...

Things get in the way of this romance, though. Such as the missing pouch and the Mumbai thugs still hot in pursuit. And then there's Shankar having to pose as a doctor and diagnosing his patients and such. I told you it's a silly film.

BOMBAY TO BANGKOK has a shorter running time than most Bollywood flicks. And at 2 hours and 6 minutes, that's a good thing, because the wacky, brainless story can hold itself together for only so long. Nagesh Kukunoor, who wrote and directed the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iqbal/dp/B000I0RVI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iqbal</a>&nbsp;(with Shreyas Talpade great in that titular role), also writes and directs BOMBAY TO BANGKOK, but not as successfully. Still, I found enough in this film to enjoy that I'm recommending it.

Mostly, it's because of the two leads. Shreyas Talpade, an up-and-comer in Bollywood, is deadpan and funny and likable. Shreyas's character is quick-thinking, is won't to hold internal monologues, and is prone to occasional daydreams. Shreyas plays his role straight, never quite crossing that line into straight-up loopiness (although there is that one dance he does when he finds out that Jasmine's dad has only come down with gas, instead of, say, a heart attack). The beautiful Lina Christianson (or Lena Christensen), a real-life TV personality in Thailand who's actually already starred in a few films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tesseract/dp/B0002X7GSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tesseract</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sars-Wars-Bangkok-Zombie-Crisis/dp/B000G1QU7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sars Wars: Bangkok Zombie Crisis</a>), dips her toe in Bollywood waters for the first time. Lina plays a prostitute here, which might turn some people off, except that she's one of those sweet-natured soiled doves, and with a heart of gold, to boot. And she volunteers at the medical camp. AND she's smoking hot! Shreyas and Lina have an easy chemistry, which is kind of remarkable considering that the only times their characters understand each other are when they're able to haltingly conjure up words in English. Then again, there are other ways to communicate, than words. It ends up being a really nice romantic story.

By the way, for fans of Naseeruddin Shah, yes, he's in this one, but for only one little scene. Typically, he's good in it.

I laughed at the goofy, sometimes crude humor. There's some stuff here with Viagra and flatulence. One of the thugsters is a wannabe rapper (he's got a poster of Eminem in his lair). I liked the sequence with Jasmine's uncle, who is a diehard Bollywood fan. And the scene in which Shankar and Jasmine accuse the other's country of coming up with the strangest names for people (they then proceed to demonstrate...). Personally, I think the fish-out-of-water element could've been played up even more for laughs, with Shankar trying to make heads or tails of such a strange culture.

Oh, for folks who like outtakes, stick around during the closing credits...

So BOMBAY TO BANGKOK is definitely lightweight entertainment. It's not must-see stuff, really. Just something to check out if your calendar's idle. As stated, the two leads are the reasons to see this. However, if you want to see Shreyas Talpade at his best, there's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iqbal/dp/B000I0RVI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iqbal</a>&nbsp;(even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dil-Dosti-etc/dp/B000ZKQN0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dil Dosti etc</a>&nbsp;is pretty good). If you want to see Lina Christianson in a better flick, check out the darkly comic zombie Thai flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sars-Wars-Bangkok-Zombie-Crisis/dp/B000G1QU7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sars Wars: Bangkok Zombie Crisis</a>.

Anyway, I think, three and a half stars for BOMBAY TO BANGKOK. Just shift your brains on park.",1211328000,2,5373,5.798479087452471
