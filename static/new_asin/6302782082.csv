The Legend of Custer (1968) has a terribly written script and that makes it bog down to the point of ridiculousness. Unintentionally, it almost seems like a parody it is so ill-fittingly awful. But I think they were serious about elevating Gen. George Armstrong Custer from his reputation downfall.

Putting the stiff actor Wayne Maunder as Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer hampers it even more. Custer is an asinine man. The man is obviously a boisterous braggart and annoying. Richard Mulligan also played Gen. George Armstrong Custer in Little Big Man (1970) with much better effect.

Here he arrives at some fort and attempts to straighten up the place, brandishing his stiff sense of ""order"" to an unruly cavalry regiment. He also tries to capture or kill his much-hated Oglala Lakota rival Crazy Horse (actor Michael Dante). Michael Dante you'll recognize from ""Star Trek"" as Maab (1967), Apache Rifles (1964), and as a Blackfoot Chief in Winterhawk (1975).

The scenes with the Native Americans are pathetic. Custer rides his horse through a group of Blackfeet Indians and shoots about five of them. Crazy Horse gets captured by Blackfeet Indians and then Custer wants to rescue him, but afterwards he wants to kill him.

The small plot involves Crazy Horse meeting with a Kiowa Indian chief (actor Rodolfo Acosta, who always played an Apache Indian in many films) who is buying up rifles.

One scene which will make you laugh is when Custer shoots an injured bear and a rock avalanche traps him. The rocks get ""neatly"" stacked up somehow.

If you like Westerns you'll want to see this, but don't expect much.",1510099200,,1668,4.956989247311828

7830823,1,6302782082,"I should send it back as it was advertised as The Legend of Custer compilation film from the TV series, but is instead two documentaries: The Legend of Custer and Crazy Horse.  But it hardly seems worth the effort.  Just not pleased.",1468972800,,233,4.523809523809524
7830824,3,6302782082,"The Legend of Custer is set after the Civil War when the Indian wars are being waged. Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer (Wayne Maunder) has been assigned to command the 7th Cavalry regiment at Fort Hays, an outfit of low reputation. The regiment is composed of ex-Confederates, criminals, and renegades, and has  degenerated as discipline has broken down. Custer must whip the soldiers into shape to protect settlers on the surrounding plains by fighting the Kiowa, Sioux and Blackfoot, tribes that are being supplied by a white gunrunner. Custer and his men must rescue General Terry and the Fifth Cavalry regiment from sure death when they are ambushed and trapped by a large Kiowa war party.

Custer has been portrayed countless times in the movies, mostly as an ambitious, glory-seeking officer who led his men into an ambush at the Little Big Horn. The Legend of Custer gives us another view of the man  a sharp military officer who disobeyed orders primarily because he was a better strategist and tactician than his superiors. This feature film is an expanded, re-edited pilot for a TV series that aired a few months in late 1967. It contains plenty of action with lots of stunt work.

As a fictionalized drama, it nonetheless depicts Custer as more than a foolhardy, inept, irresponsible man. Maunder is not the most exciting screen Custer, but serviceable enough. If you're looking for star power in a Custer flick, check out They Died With Their Boots On, with Errol Flynn. The Legend of Custer DVD is unrated. There are no bonus features. Picture quality looks somewhat washed out, but doesnt detract much from enjoyment of the movie.",1461542400,,1644,4.902877697841727

It begins on a dark and stormy night. A lone rider walks into Fort Hays Kansas. Custer finds soldiers playing dice in the barn and shows his authority by commanding respect. Lt. Col. Custer introduces himself as in charge of the Seventh Cavalry. He owns two Irish Wolfhounds and hunting trophies. The next day Custer shows his daring in preventing an ambush. There is a trader who offers guns and ammunition for gold, once the Indians can obtain gold. General Terry tells Custer he doesnt like him but needs him for the war. Soldiers cant be arrested by the civil authorities so the Army has become a refuge for criminals, ex-Confederates, and a few immigrant soldiers. Custer shows his horsemanship to the soldiers. General Terrys niece is on the post. Rumors of gold will draw prospectors, whiskey salesmen, and cause an Indian revolt. Can the Cavalry keep them out? Custer was an admirer of Marat, a former stable boy.

Indians attack prospectors to rob their gold and then buy guns to defend their people and their lands. Gunfire draws the Cavalry to find the victims of an attack by the Kiowas. The duty of the Seventh Cavalry is to provision Fort Hays (hay, wood) and not to engage the enemy. Garry Owen becomes the regimental song. Custer goes bear hunting for grizzlies close to Indian Territory. Custer goes alone after a wounded grizzly bear! Blackfoot Indians pass near by, they have a prisoner. Custer follows, then is taken prisoner. But he escapes with Crazy Horse! [Purely drama.] General Terry will not allow a hunting party to search for Custer. Custer and Crazy Horse argue in that cave before walking to the Rosebud river. Crazy Horse finds food for them. Thanks for your help. The hunting party sees Blackfoot Indians searching for someone. There is drama on the mountains! [This doesnt seem real.] Crazy Horse can drink bitter water. Custer speaks about change and progress to make a great nation. Can they live together in peace? They reach the Rosebud river and swim across. Custer is confronted but dives into the river to escape.

Custer joins the soldiers sent to find him. Then they search for Crazy Horse. There is a fight, there are no prisoners. Crazy Horse has slipped away. Custer is reprimanded for being absent with out leave. Their job is not to fight the Indians but to garrison the fort. A patrol is ambushed and surrounded. General Terry sends a messenger to Custer to order him to hold the fort and ignore the trapped soldiers. Custer follows orders as is his wont. Troopers mount up and follow Custer to the trapped soldiers. Custers tactic is to draw the enemy fire while out of range then attack while the Indians reload. The Indians are driven off. The arms dealer is paid off. Custer explains how he followed orders. The Seventh Cavalry will garrison and supply the fort. [A presence of strength.] Then Custer and his men return to the fort.

This fictionalized drama provides a more accurate view of George Armstrong Custer than a movie that portrays him as a vainglorious fool. They Died With Their Boots On is still the best Hollywood movie about this American hero, famous from helping to win the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 to his death in combat in 1876 at age 36. Custer was promoted to Brigadier General at age 23, a record that will never be equaled; then to Major General the next year. These were temporary promotions, his permanent rank was Lt. Colonel. Custer led from the front, like many other generals. Robert Utleys biography Cavalier in Buckskin explains his life. The phrase Custers Luck referred to his record ; he never lost a battle except his last one.

Custers defeat had two views. For Democrats it resulted from President Grants Indian policy; for Republicans it was the result of Custers foolish attack against superior forces. But General Terry was also defeated by Chief Crazy Horse who used coordinated attacks rather than individual actions (as in Medieval Warfare). In time superior forces, tactics, and weapons conquered the Indians and forced them into reservations. Their lands were developed for farming and mining. Custer respected his enemy and their way of life, but he followed orders. This seems to be set in the hills of California and not on the Great Plains, and is not a big budget movie.",1373587200,,4311,4.796769851951548
7830826,4,6302782082,"Despite what the two previous reviews state, this two-video set is actually two documentaries about Custer's Last Stand. I don't know why Amazon.com continues to not properly describe the contents of products and movies, so I'll let you know what's actually on this set.

First we have ""The Legend of Custer"" documentary, which is really low-budget but makes great use of silent film clips portraying Custer's Last Stand. You probably won't learn anything new from this documentary, but at least it's a rare chance to see some clips from some of the earliest Hollywood movies about Custer's Last Stand. There's also footage of a very early reenactment of the battle included.

The other documentary, ""Custer's Last Trooper"", is a fascinating account of an unidentified trooper being excavated by archaeologists on the Little Bighorn battlefield. They reconstruct his face and through extensive research are able to identify him, giving the viewer a personal glimpse of what a typical trooper in the famed 7th Cavalry looked like. These documentaries are highly recommended for history buffs who just can't get enough of Custer's Last Stand!",1107043200,10,1140,5.258241758241758
7830827,5,6302782082,"This was the pilot for this ill-fated 17-episode television series about this fascinating American hero beautifully portrayed by the top actor, Wayne Maunder.
It is a must have for your history library.
While it does take liberties with history, as Hollywood always does, it is still a very well made and exciting western series.
The only reason it was canceled was the bad timing of coming out as the Vietnam war grew. Public opinion against the war turned against this military series.
Not sure what Mr. Maunder is doing now. Heard everything from being a music producer, to being a producer/director of idependent films.
I would like to see him make a comeback as an actor and release his Custer series onto DVD in a set of the whole series.
Maybe even with some comentary from him on the making of the series.",1016323200,8,813,4.6923076923076925
