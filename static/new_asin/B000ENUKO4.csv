8111652,5,B000ENUKO4,"I wrote the same review for the rest of the Sonic X DVDs that I bought (I bought them all), but I thought I would write something special for this particular one.  I think this dvd especially the last episode is the perfect example of why this series is so special.  This dvd shows that this show is not afraid to show emotion.  I found the relationship between Sonic and the rich kid Chris to be particularly touching...It's not for the faint of heart or for the stone heart for that matter.  When Chris has to say goodbye to Sonic(his best friend and basically a super hero), it VERY sad and touching.  It has an E.T. effect to it, but on steroids.  Anyway, I would not recommend this for the young lonely kid in your family, unless you are a loving parent and spend quality time with them.  Without some friends in their life this dvd could very well just send them into a depression.  Anyways, thanks for the prompt delivery.  It is in good condition too.",1290556800,,959,4.372881355932203

8111656,5,B000ENUKO4,"It was a very wonderful movie the last Two episodes were very dramtic they were so wonderful they made me cry. The first episode has the President trying to make Sonic,Knuckles,and Rouge enter the tornment. Any one can enter it by calling in. The winner gets a red chaos emerald. The winner Emerl! The last episodes are about how Sonic and Chris's planets were both one. Then they serprated into two and they are becomeing one again and if they do time will freeze. So,Sonic and his Friends would have to go back to Mobius. After hearing this Chris said ""It's not true it must be Dr. Eggman."" Will Sonic be able to go back to Mobius? Find out on the next Sonic X!",1151798400,4,663,4.354838709677419
