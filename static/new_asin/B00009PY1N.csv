7992354,5,B00009PY1N,"""Yoga for Urban living is designed to work around your schedule."" ~Hemalaya Behl

The titles of the Yoga for Urban Living workouts are amusing and this one is no exception. When they say: Evening Bath - they mean it. You know how you feel when you have a nice warm bath before bed? Well, this yoga workout will have the exact same effect. I'm not sure if it is just the poses or the music that helps you relax into a deep level of peace. The truth is, I feel blissfully asleep while in the relaxation pose and now I know that I should probably climb into bed at that stage. This ""evening bath"" workout is definitely for the time right before bed.

Hemalaya Behl's Yoga workouts allow you to create your very own yoga sanctuary. Her workouts embody the spirit of yoga. The purple walls in this workout speak of relaxation and the wood floors and plants place an emphasis on natural materials.

The exercises start with ""OM"" and as the word vibrates through your entire being, you will quickly abandon all worry and fear and sink into a state of serenity. There are a few gentle twists and then you start to breathe away your tension and stress. This is mainly a floor workout where you spend lots of time in each pose and there is no rush, no place to go.

Hemalaya Behl has a very casual approach. In fact, she is talking you through the entire workout ""from a distance."" She doesn't actually speak during the workout, but her calming voice drifts in and out of the soundtrack. If you are finely tuned and ready to move as soon as an instructor tells you what you will be doing next, relax into this calming series of exercises. There is no rush, no place to go, just breathe.

Hemalaya also includes a variety of authentic moves and creative poses. I find her instruction style to be very calming and she has a beautiful spirit. You will recognize most of the yoga poses. Spine stretch, leg stretches while on your back, spinal lift, relaxing rolls from side to side, youth postures (fountain of youth - I had no idea my body could do this pose), resting pose (definite challenge pose you can work into over time), chest-opening poses and full-body stretch.

The pace is just slow enough to relax and just fast enough so you don't get bored.

IDEA: I think you can enjoy this workout even more if you place a blanket or down comforter on the floor and then put your yoga mat on top of the blanket/comforter. Having another comforter for the relaxation stage adds an entire new dimension of luxurious comfort. Then, fold a towel in half and place it in the middle of your mat. This gives you more ""comfort"" during your workout. I find it is easy to move the towel, but I really enjoy the feeling of a soft towel under my feet instead of always feeling the cold ""plastic"" feel of the yoga mat. Doing all this might seem like too much extra effort, but when you do the Urban Living workouts, you are really creating a mood and a place for your soul to escape and your body to relax.

Well, I've completed all of Hemalaya Behl's workouts and really hope that she is making more. I love them all and enjoy the authenticity of the practice and her beautiful spirit and radiance. Her voice is calming and that is very important for a yoga workout.

You might also enjoy:

Morning Quickie and Daily Connection. With the three main workouts, you can create three different places of peace for various times of the day. When I want to fall asleep fast, ""Evening Bath"" is going to be my choice!

Highly Recommended.

7992355,5,B00009PY1N,"I have this workout on DVD and really enjoy it. Forcing myself to unwind at the end of the day is great. The music is soothing and my tension drips down into the floor. I'm not very experienced so I found the shoulder stand a bit difficult, but what I've learned from class ""is move at your own pace"". It's also not very long and I found myself just taking time out during the day to lie on the floor and do parts of this workout. I've seen a lot of Yoga videos, and most start off easy and then get out of control and difficult. Most have an intimidation  super-fit-instructor factor. Hemalaya is very more like the instructor in my class, and less of a mythical fitness god. I can definitely connect. I highly recommend this video - If you have a DVD player, get her DVD - it has 3 full flows plus some breathing and instructional bits. And the menus are beautiful to watch on their own.",1066521600,2,889,4.229411764705882
7992356,5,B00009PY1N,"This video was a godsend!
As I work in sales, I am constantly travelling long distances and sometimes through different time-zones. Because my sleeping habits are so sparatic, I often have trouble getting to sleep. This yoga routine was exactly what it claimed to be: A relaxing and soothing routine that truely helped to balance my body and help me relax and sleep like I haven't been able to in some time.
Thank you Miss Behl.",1063584000,2,428,4.644736842105263
7992357,3,B00009PY1N,"This is the third of Hemalaya Behl's three yoga videos:  the first is a morning practice, the second a longer day time practice, and this one is designed as a relaxing evening practice.  Although I like Hemalaya as an instructor, I didn't enjoy her here as much as in her first two videos.  In general, Hemalaya's voice is pleasant, her instruction smooth, but in this practice, she frequently spoke in a very rote-sounding monotone, and her voiceover instruction was often out-of-sync with her movements on screen, making the program difficult to follow.

I also think that this video is more geared to yoga practitioners who have had quite a bit of experience performing inversions for longer periods.  Towards the end of the workout, Hemalaya incorporates shoulderstand, plow pose, and deaf man's pose, each held for an extended length of time.  Those who are experienced with these inverted poses are likely to find this section very relaxing, but I found the poses to be more challenging, which made it quite difficult for me to relax.

Although this video was not for me, it might work well for a more intermediate/advanced yogi who is looking for a relaxation practice which includes inversion postures.",1062720000,4,1210,4.990049751243781
