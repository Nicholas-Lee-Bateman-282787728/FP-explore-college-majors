Viveca Lindfors offers memorable support as the poetic Professor Taub. A pleasant diversion, but Reiner and Cusack had better films awaiting them.",1469318400,2,375,5.714285714285714

979634,5,6305181381,"It's a sure thing you'll love this movie if you like not so sappy romance movies. It's a road trip romantic comedy from an opposites attract angle. I like the similarities between it and When Harry Met Sally. Daphne Zuniga as Allison is perfect. The Allison character encompasses a lot of great female personality traits. Her boyfriend is a type A personality organized, reliable, smart, successful, and predictable. Jason is Allison's sure thing. In contrast Gib is a type B personality disorganized, lazy, unpredictable, spontaneous and a huge gamble. Allison is a type A personality and her personality collides with Gibs. They spend much of the film healthily arguing out their differences. The adventure they have on the road brings them together. Allison struggles because she starts developing feelings for Gib but she still has her boyfriend Jason. Gib just wants to be with Allison but keeps his distance as not to pressure Allison. He uses his sure thing, a date with a girl his friend as set him up with in LA as a cushion. Allison battles between choosing the logic choice Jason or going with her emotions and choosing Gib. The moral of the story is takes opposites to make electricity. Allison makes Gib a more complete person and Gib does the same for Allison.",1466035200,,1274,4.875576036866359
979635,5,6305181381,"One of my favorites. I love reading reviews that respect it for being more closer to finding love and college life than hyping up all the sex scenes. John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga not only have wonderful chemistry, but they also look beautiful together. They're both tall, have dark hair and fresh young faces. It was so nice to watch and surprisingly touching for an 80's teen movie. Loved it. A must-see for rom-com fans.",1464652800,,423,4.653333333333333

979637,5,6305181381,"Hooray for early Rob Reiner! John Cusack when his intelligent hormonal boy-man schtick was still one-of-a-kind charming and original. The scene where he plays a crazy to rescue Alison (Daphne Zuniga) from the sleazy faux-cowboy has never been bested. And Daphne Zuniga nails the nerd! Hollywood rarely gets this right, but she actually is believable as a driven, top-notch college student who needs to learn to loosen up a bit. The California scenes have not aged well, but little in California does, and they are not the point of the movie.",1457136000,2,541,4.956043956043956

980540,4,6305181381,"This movie from 1985 already seems like a time capsule from a distant era. No cellphones, no iPods -- the characters use artifcacts like ""Filofaxes"" -- and the teens who make up most of the cast seem oddly naive and sweet compared to their counterparts today. But in its sentiments, the movie hasn't aged that much.

The absurdly young John Cusack plays Gib, a faily typical young male who finds himself as a freshman on an east Coast campus struggling to keep up with some of his peers. He's creative -- but lacks basic grammar and spelling. He tries to latch on to brainy, culturally sophisticated Allison (Daphne Zuniga), a preppy, overscheduled uptight type. But Cusack's clumsy approaches earn only her scorn.

The two are thrust together on a cross-country Christmas vacation trip when Gib is lured to California with the promise of a ""sure thing"" -- a beautiful woman waiting only to have brainless, guilt-free sex with him. Allison is going to visit her boyfriend -- an absurd type even more uptight than she is. They find themselves sharing a ride with a young couple with a penchant for show tunes  - until they are kicked out on the open road and forced to hitchhike.

Naturally Gib and Allison fall in love during the trip during which they endure various amusing adventures.

Within its genre, this ranks as a pretty decent romantic comedy.  It launched Cusack's career and there are amusing riffs also by Anthony Edwards who went to to star in ""ER"" and a young Tim Robbins giving a very funny cameo. Whatever happened to Zuniga anyway?

This is a college romance(why don't they make those anymore?) and thus has more depth than the high school romcoms that are either gross or immature. At a New England college we see 2 students in an English Lit. class. He is brash,irreverent,superficial,make-it-up-as-you-go-along guy. She is studious,prim,organised,focussed. You just know that they are made for each other,because each can save the other from their foolishness. The question is will they realise it?A series of disastrous encounters between the 2 reinforces the poor opinion each has of the other during the school term(and there are some great lines to remember).But each is going to L.A. for the Xmas holidays. Cusack to meet every guy's fantasy- a date with a gorgeous California girl,that his best buddy has set him up with and whom is guaranteed to be a ""sure thing""!Zuniga is going out to L.A. to see her equally studious boyfriend whom she calls at 7.45pm each night. By accident they find themselves in the same car sharing the trip with 2 others(who are absolutely hilarious simpletons).The 2 spend the whole trip arguing,bickering and annoying each other to the point that they get abandoned in the roadway by the others. And so they decide to hitch/walk to L.A. Along the way they start to discover different facets of the other,that challenge their hitherto first impressions. She can be spontaneous and open minded. He can be gallant and caring. Watch for the scene in the truck driven by a wonderfully sleazy actor (who went on to play the drill sergeant in ""full metal jacket"")where Cusack basically saves Zuniga from a fate worse than death (as Jane Austen would say).But every time these 2 start to get closer,something prevents them from coming together. My wife shouted at the screen-""Kiss her now you idiot!"" twice-once after the beer chugging scene and once after the waking up scene. Anyway,as the trip unfolds,we see Cusack's recurring fantasies about his blonde ""sure thing"" begin to wobble. Until finally,to his surprise and part horror,his recurring dream about the blonde morphs at the crucial moment into Zuniga which wakes him up with a start. His true feelings about Zuniga are beginning to surface and Reiner handles this beautifully. Watch how her suitcase plays a key role too. Throughout the trip she is lugging this big suitcase with everything you could need as any organised girl would. And he lets her do it. But at a key point,Cusack picks it up for her and says ""that's ok I got it"".And that's when you know he is hooked. But once more,just as you think they are going to be OK,he manages to screw up when he tells a truck driver who is giving them the final ride to LA that he is going there to meet his sure thing. Zuniga,who doesn't know why he is going to LA as it hasn't come up,wakes up in the back just as Cusack is boasting,and she gets totally upset,but doesn't say anything.
When they get to LA all hell breaks loose. They are totally confused about their feelings for each other,but neither knows how to break the cycle of closeness followed by distrust. She goes to her boyfriend and he goes to meet the blonde at a party. Once with her boyfriend Zuniga realises that she can't stop thinking about Cusack,and misses being with him. So,she talks her boyfriend(who is clearly destined to be ex-boyfriend)into going to the party. There she works hard to get  Cusack jealous,and then watches Cusack as he returns the compliment. A big argument ensues with some great lines(from Zuniga-""he thinks love is something you can order out like a pizza!"") .They both leave the party separately. She with boyfriend ,he with blonde.
Does she go to bed with her boyfriend?Does he go to bed with the blonde?
We don't know. But the next time we see them,they are in the same english class,where she won't talk to him. And then the English prof reads from the best essay that has been handed in after the xmas vacation. It's called the ""sure thing"" and it's by Cusack. Zuniga cringes in horror expecting the final humiliation-and a public one at that. But as the essay is read out by the prof to the class ,something happens in the essay that she did not foresee at all. It becomes clear that Cusack understood the difference between the ""real thing"" (with her)and a ""sure thing"" (with the gorgeous blonde) and that the ""real thing"" is what counts.
""You didn't sleep with her?"" Zuniga asks filled with surprise/wonder.
Aaah..... see the rest for yourselves. My teenage kids loved it,and maybe they will remember it and focus on the ""real thing"" as they develop their relationships.",1258329600,,4700,4.773955773955774

980712,5,6305181381,"On the heels of hits like Breakfast Club and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The Sure Thing may have escaped the notice of viewers.  However, once you see it, you cannot deny the magic and simplicity of this great little gem.  It relates to us so honestly, innocently, and completely with its characters, that virtually everyone can find some element that speaks to them.

I think most people, at some time or another, have found themselves attracted to someone that they have virtually nothing in common with.  The irony, is that we generally don't even wonder why.  We just feel the way we do.  The movie follows this idea.  It never asks why someone is attracted to someone with whom they have little or nothing in common.

Walter ""Gib"" Gibson is in his freshman year of college in New England.  He's miserable.  As he states, ""I've never seen so much corduroy in one place.""  He feels that New England girls are too stuffy and intellectual.  Gib is actually intellectual himself, but you won't find him ""wasting his time"" with his nose in his textbooks either.  His best friend, Lance (and high school best friend) is at a college in sunny California.  He sends Gib a picture of a beautiful blond woman and says, ""this is the ugliest girl here.""

Lance invites Gib out to California for a ""sure thing;"" a guaranteed night of passion with a gorgeous woman played by Nicolette Sheridan.  There's a catch here in the story.  Gib has unwittingly found himself attracted to the class ""brain"" of his English class, Alison.  She's certainly not the type of girl that Gib has envisioned for himself, but nonetheless, he's attracted to her.  Alison could care less about someone who lives their life as carefree as Gib does.  Alison can't do anything without consulting her schedule book.  She's an organizational freak who is incapable of doing anything spontaneous.  When Gib feels that he'll never get anywhere with her, he takes Lance up on his offer.

When Gib finds a ride across country, he doesn't realize that Alison has also signed up for a ride in the same car, as she is on her way to visit her boyfriend in California.

The film really takes off from here, as these two unlikely people begin to find something appealing about the other.  Alison finds herself becoming a bit more loose, and Gib finds himself becoming a bit more responsible.  But, what will happen when Gib gets to California for his ""sure thing.""  After all, the bathing beauty is the type of girl that Gib wants, right?

For those who have not seen the film, I won't say any more about this.  The beauty of this film is in the journey, not the end.  The best movie I've ever seen about two people getting to know each other is ""Before Sunrise.""  ""The Sure Thing"" is right up there for me as well.  It's realistic, and it's easy to believe what is happening between these two characters who appear to be at opposite poles with each other.

Rob Reiner does a magnificent job as the director of this film.  It's as if he has the pulse of both of these characters, and makes sure that nothing is forced to produce the ending that he envisions.  In this way, he's created a realistic and yet simplistic film for anyone who has ever fallen in love with someone who is completely opposite, and how two people in this situation can really learn about themselves through someone else.

This is one of my two favorite roles played by John Cusack.  He simply has Gib down cold.  ""Say Anything"" is my other favorite.  Cusack seems able to play Gib without any effort.  He knows him inside and out.  And he makes Gib a very likeable person, despite his ""flaws.""

Daphne Zuniga is equally good as the uptight Alison.  She wears sweaters, and keeps herself looking ultra-conservative.  Daphne is a beautiful girl, but she isn't over-the-top gorgeous, and that's important for this movie because the physical attraction is NOT what motivates these two characters.

980714,5,6305181381,"How this movie slipped past me until almost 2000 I'll never know. My passion for going to movies has always been sporadic, with large gaps of time with either fanatacism or apathy towards  what type of movies were being put out. 1985 was when my interest was rekindled with boat loads of movies addressing my age group  I must have just missed this one. I'm a huge fan of John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, the latter of who ranks way atop my all time fave females list. Having seen most of Zuniga's relatively low output of work (I refused to lower myself to watching ""Melrose Place"" just to catch a glimpse of her), being told about this movie caught me way off guard, since this is both her and Cusack at their earliest. This was the first movie they both had significant dialogue and camera time and they both make the most of it. In an era where most teen/post teen flicks were covered by the likes of John Hughes, director Rob Reiner in only his second film hits a home run. Hughes movies are awesome. They are time capsule candidates for many reasons. But ""The Sure Thing"" connects in a totally different way with its similarly aged cast and settings, giving us a movie that highlights a slew of mixed feelings by Cusack's and Zuniga's characters, some spoken, many unspoken until push comes to shove. I don't know what it is about Zuniga, but she's always had a strong appeal to me. Maybe it's because she comes across as the unpretentious type that every guy likes. In ""Sure Thing"" she wavers between that personna and the ""in love with being in love"" dedicated to her studies and her future husband who schools on the opposite west coast where Zuniga and Cusack's cross country Christmas time journey is taking them. What starts off as a case of two complete opposites that drive each other crazy turns into an epiphany of feelings for each other despite their differences. By the movies end, it's safe to say that each has adopted a little of what makes the other person tick. Zuniga learns to loosen up a bit, while Cusack learns not to be too shallow. Reiner touches on genuine feelings and concerns of the college age characters, and from beginning to end paints a background of college experiences that anyone who's gone through it can totally relate to. He may get a little hokey or over-the-top in some scenes, in painting the straight laced extent of Zuniga's character for example. But his use of the surrounding character actors only helps soliidify the story in the foreground. ""Sure Thing"" Nicolette Sheridan, as the reason for Cusack's quest west, peaked in the gorgeous category with this movie. She's an abolute doll, a mere shadow of her ""Desperate Housewives"" character of the future. Viveca Lindfors, Tim Robbins and Anthony Edwards (during his ""Nerd"" years) all give major contributions with minimal screen time. Lindfors English Class Professor character and classroom setting put you in an authentic college atmosphere in bookend scenes that remind you by the movies' end that these are two young adults that are still evolving in school and in life.

980857,5,6305181381,"""The Sure Thing"" (1985) is perhaps one of the most underrated comedies of an era that was bursting at the seams with romantic comedies.
John Cusack stars as Walter Gibson (""Gib""), a college freshman who is attending school at an unnamed Ivy League college.  He is disappointed that his romantic life is somewhat lacking (although, inexplicably, his unattractive, overweight roommate is scoring a lot of action) but sees hope with Alison (Daphne Zuniga), an extremely uptight, prissy girl who adheres to routine like a religion that is in his English class.  Gib's high school friend Lance (Anthony Edwards, just before his breakout in ""Top Gun"") has gone to school out in Southern California and invites Gib to come out over the Christmas break as Lance has a girl that is a ""sure thing"" and Gib is sure to score.  Gib ends up in a cross-country adventure with the prissy Alison, heading out to California to visit her equally uptight and unexciting fiance Jason (Boyd Gaines), and nutty Gary Cooper (Tim Robbins, in an early film role) - - ""but not that Gary Cooper that's dead"" and Mary Ann (Lisa Ann Persky), two people that are so perky and into showtunes that you wish that Gib would hurl himself out the car window.
As can be expected, Gib and Alison develop feelings for one another during the road trip.  What happens when they get to California?  Will Gib hook up with The Sure Thing (Nicollette Sheridan)?  Will Alison stay engaged to Jason?  Will she realize that Gib is perfect for her?
The ending should be absolutely no surprise but the journey is all the fun.
Rob Reiner does a terrific job with this little film, and John Cusack is simply awesome!  This role, along with Lloyd Dobler from ""Say Anything"", really put him on the map.  His Gib comes across as a funny, romantic, touching guy - - not a partyer, not a horndog.  You can really relate to Gib, and that makes him real.  And it makes the movie work.  The story is nothing new, but with Cusack at the helm, the movie takes off.
Daphne Zuniga as Alison is perfectly cast.  She's a pretty girl, without being standout stunning, and her gradual realization that there is more to Gib than meets the eye doesn't seem forced.

Rob Reiner's classic 1985 teen comedy, ""The Sure Thing"", features one of John Cusack's first starring roles as Gib Gibson, an early performance by the very young and beautiful Daphne Zuniga as Alison Bradbury, and a bizarre appearance by Tim Robbins in one of his first films as well.  Though this is a movie of firsts for its soon-to-be-famous cast, the story is not particulary original nor inventive.  In fact, it is downright predictable.  Within the first five minutes, you will know exactly how things are going to end up.  Yet the beauty of this film is the sweet, funny, romantic, and old-fashioned ride that it takes in order to bring you to that oh-so-predictable ending.

This is a film that has exquisitely stood the test of time.  As a matter of fact, if you hold it up to the majority of romantic comedies churned out by Hollywood during the 90's and onwards, one will find that this is a truly charming film.  Modern romantic comedy hits such as ""She's All That"", ""Down to You"", ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""Head Over Heels"", and ""Never Been Kissed"" provide excellent juxtaposition to the near genre-perfection of this film.

The plot is simple enough, but Reiner's direction makes the movie a true gem; as do the efforts of Cusack and Zuniga--plus the supporting cast, which include a pre-'Goose' Anthony Andrews and a truly funny Tim Robbins (he's less funny nowadays, of course, but in '85 he exhibited definite comedic talent).

I've decided that this one's right up there with my favorites. One of those movies, with endless quotable lines, that charms you out of your wits without even trying.

But what makes this movie so enjoyable and memorable is the feelings it provokes. Remember the rush of emotions when you first meet someone who makes your heart beat out of your chest and feel lightheaded? Acting like you really don't like someone when deep down inside you would give anything to be with them? Going to a party and flirting with other people hoping that they would see you and get jealous? That's what this movie does for me. It makes me realize just how much I miss the innocence, passion and emotion of those days.
The acting is wonderful and you really get drawn in to their plight as they make their way across the country to be with the one they ""think"" is their own ""sure thing"". The great thing about this movie is that every time it looks like they are finally going to get together, something pulls them apart.

Personally, I think this is John Cusak's best acting role ever.  Even the smaller parts (such as Tim Robbins' are hillarious).
Additionally, this DVD has great features.  For example you can watch in either widescreen or normal mode.  You also have the option of turning on the director's (Rob Reiner) commentary so you can listen to him speak over the movie giving his comments on the actors, scenes, etc.  There's also a trivia feature that will play the movie while popping up little triva-blurbs on each screen.  There are also ""featurettes"" that discuss the casting, wardrobe, etc.

The Sure Thing embraces John's usual craziness and opened the doors for more starring roles. This is one of my all-time favorite films. I have watched repeatedly since I was seven and I still love it.  It's the perfect 80's film all in one. It's light, fun and touching.  The Sure Thing has everything you'd need and more. The film comes equipped with hunky men, foxy ladies and enough funny one-liners to put the writers of "" Becker "" to shame. You get a fantastic road trip, top romance and the world of the 80's all in one DVD!  And as always Cusack gets his woman.

981013,4,6305181381,"The Sure Thing is director Rob Reiner's second film and his first conventional movie after the mockumentary format of This Is Spinal Tap.  The film has the classic teenage plot of boy meets girl, girl at first hates boy and then in the end they end up together.  But instead of being just another clich&eacute;, The Sure Thing features such likable and winning performances by the two leads, John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, that it becomes a memorable and lovable film.  Mr. Cusack stars as Walter ""Gib"" Gibson who is in a slump when it comes to getting girls.  Everyone around him at his New England campus seems to be scoring, except him.  He meets a pretty girl, Alison (Ms. Zuniga) in his English class and tries to hook up with her.  Alison is a straitlaced girl, who schedules everything she does to the second, while Gib is a spontaneous guy who lives life minute to minute.  Alison agrees to tutor Gib in English and he tries to seduce her, but he fails miserably and she ends up hating him.  His best friend from high school, Lance (Anthony Edwards) is out at college in California where he has set up a date for Gib who is a ""sure thing"".  All Gib has to do is get to California by 12/22 and he's in.  The problem is he has no money to fly, so he finds a ride with a couple who are driving out to Los Angeles.  As fate would have it, Alison is also in the car as she is heading out to see her boyfriend in LA.  The couple Gary Cooper and Mary Ann Webster are upbeat squares who sing showtunes on the trip.  Gary is played by a young Tim Robbins in one of his first roles.  Gib and Alison are constantly bickering at one another and eventually they are thrown out of the car and forced to hitch.  Along the way, Alison starts to see the real charm in Gib and starts to fall for him.  Eventually they reach LA and go their separate ways.  They both end up at the party where Gib meets his sure thing (Nicolette Sheridan).  Jealousy ensues between the two and Gib eventually takes his sure thing up to Lance's bedroom.  The movie flashes forward where Gib and Alison are back in English class and we learn that Gib didn't cash in on his sure thing and Alison and Gib end up sharing a kiss under the stars.  Mr. Cusack got his first leading role after a series of bit parts and he shines in his opportunity.  He shows that offbeat charm that would become his signature trait.  Mr. Reiner perfectly captures life on the road in America and the film is a low-key success.",1061856000,3,2474,4.286637931034483
981081,5,6305181381,"First, to who said it wasn't as good as Say Anything - the two movies are too different to even be compared. The characters and basis of both movies are too different to be compared. If you want to compare The Sure Thing with any other movie, compare it to Hot Pursuit, as they have more in common than Say Anything and The Sure Thing. (And it's my ultimate belief that, while Hot Pursuit is a good movie, it's just not as good as The Sure Thing.)
Now, to the important matters at hand...
This is my numero uno favorite movie of all time on my top 5 list. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again and it never gets old. The whole movie is hilarious, and it makes me want to go on a cross country road trip.
Tim Robbins' cameo as a goody-goody is hilarious and Anthony Edwards as Cusack's high school friend going to college on the west coast (the guy who sets Cusack up with a ""Sure Thing"", the entire reason for the road trip) is also a definate plus.

The chemistry between John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga is perfect.  Tim Robbins tormenting his passengers with showtunes is hysterical.  But above all I say this...what makes this movie so special is its ability to actually infuse the viewer with a strong desire to live and grow.  This movie isn't just about cutting through heaps of differences to find your soulmate, it's about being brave...to love life...to embrace the world.

981218,5,6305181381,"THE SURE THING was a great film when it came out, and unlike many romantic comedies of the eighties, this one has held up marvelously.  The story is incredibly simple and one of the oldest in Hollywood:  a road picture.  Traditionally, road pictures use traveling as a metaphor for growth and development, whether growth for good or for ill.  Luckily in this picture, it is for good.  Both John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga's characters grow and develop during the course of the film, breaking through their own superficial beliefs about what they want in love and their perceptions about the other.  It is important to realize that this really isn't a teenage sex comedy.  A lot of teen films slap on some stuff about true love, but in fact attempt to titillate through the heart of the film.  There are titillation scenes in THE SURE THING featuring Nicolette Sheridan, but these are almost parodies of themselves.  In fact, the fantasies are more projections of Cusack's illusions about love.
This was the movie that introduced both John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga as leading performers.  John has gone on to bigger and better things, while Daphne's career has been a bit of a disappointment to me.  I adored her in this movie, and would have liked to see her in more comedies.  But the two of them made a magnificent couple in this film, and they did a perfect job of embodying their characters.  She is perfect as the overorganized, completely A.R. stuffed skirt, while he is the epitome of the mildly nerdy guy who isn't exactly a ladykiller.  In fact, part of the key to Cusack's success is that he is sort of an Everyman:  he isn't at all unattractive, but he isn't Tom Cruise.  He doesn't make women swoon.  But he possesses vulnerability, some charm, and intelligence.
This movie still charms and delights pretty much as it did when it first came out.  The music has dated a bit, and some of the hairstyles of the women are a bit painful to behold (though not Daphne's), but in most ways it continues to feel refreshingly current.  Look for Tim Robbins and Anthony Edwards in small but key roles.",1035849600,18,2100,4.657608695652174
981219,5,6305181381,"Purchased the newly available DVD of this movie and was not disappointed.  There are some great interviews with Rob Reiner and the rest of the cast and a director's commentary which makes the movie even more appealing.
I agree with the reviewers who say that they have fond memories of this movie and that they can quote lines so many years after the movie was released.  My particular favorite is the scene where Daphne Zuniga is pretending to be pregnant and is talking about names for her unborn child. She says that she likes the name ""Elliott.""  John Cusak replies ""Elliot.  Elliott's the fat kid who eats paste.  Now Nick - that's a name.  Nick's your friend.""

It's another fun film that John Cusack can add to his list of classics. He delivers another stellar performance with every bit of his distinct flavor -- his off-beat humor, his sincere acting, and of course more female rejection.

981360,5,6305181381,"I just put down a few of my thoughts about ""Say Anything,"" another John Cusack classic, and I thought I'd say my piece about this one as well...  First of all, as Austin Powers may have said once or twice in his life, my overall reaction to this film could perhaps most concisely be expressed via the simple phrase, ""yeah baby.""  This movie is fun, funny, romantic as all get out, very intelligent, and packed with lines you will never forget.  John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga's characters are the ultimate odd couple.  I once (seriously) used their two characters in an academic setting, as examples to illustrate the opposing sides of various parts of the Myers-Briggs Personality Inventory.  He is freewheeling, she is straitlaced.  He lives his life by making things up as he goes along, she plans everything out in excruciating detail.  It's like watching a photographic negative of ""Dharma and Greg.""  They learn from each other over the course of the movie, and both end up doing some real maturing, as well as reaching more of a happy medium,  personality-wise...
For the record, watch for the scene (early in the film) where John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga are up on the roof of a building, looking at the stars.  The constellations they are talking about are real -- find a ""Peterson's Guide to the Night Sky"" and look up Perseus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Draco, and Cepheus.  They're really up there, they are very easy to find in the northern hemisphere, and it's one of the coolest group of mythologically interconnected constellations in the heavens.

The best in this movie - in my opinion - is its final part: an inspired sequence of enlightened statements gracefully read in a monolog tone. This movie shows the changing every human being should undergo in Life to truly become a Human Being in its broader sense. To love is to care not only about the one we love - this is too egotistic.

The only reason that I  didn't give it 5 stars is that you need to leave somewhere to go for  ""Something about Mary..""",957657600,,389,4.731343283582089
981540,5,6305181381,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen.  No matter how many times I watch it, it ALWAYS makes me laugh.
Once Gib (Cusack) and Alison (Zuniga) hit the road - he for a 'sure thing' and she to visit her boyfriend, Jason  - suffering show tunes, losing their money, falling in love, the movie just  captivates.
Comedy aside, the film is also warm and often touching as we  watch the two leads slowly fall in love and their personalities rub off on  each other until in the end - Gib doesn't want to dress up Hawaiian style  at the party because it's 'stupid' and Alison shotgunning beer and belching  much to the disgust of her uptight boyfriend.
Laughs all round and the  story Gib writes and is read out in his English class at the very end is  wonderful.
Once it's back on video - buy it! Fast!",951264000,5,799,4.23841059602649
981541,5,6305181381,"I've been waiting.  After the success of SAY ANYTHING, it seemed liked a lock, but no.  Then there was BULLETS OVER BROADWAY and GROSSE POINTE BLANK and, fates preserve us, even CON AIR...but still no sign of THE SURE THING  coming back into regular distribution.  What in the sam hill are the  powers-that-be waiting for?
This was Rob Reiner's second picture.  It was  a strong, early leading role for John Cusack.  It was the motion picture  debut of Nicolette Sheridan.  [pause]  Well, okay, so it doesn't _all_  scream ""milestone cinema.""  But this picture is a standout among  80's youth-oriented films: it has a brain, a heart, and even some courage,  steering as it does away from the standard prurience of most other  offerings of its day and focusing instead on a tumultuous relationship  between two total opposites that's both entirely predictable and extremely  entertaining.  Plus, John Hughes had nothing to do with it, so if nothing  else, THE SURE THING proves that _someone_ else was making movies for the  16-22 crowd during the days of Reagan.
Watch for some familiar faces,  like Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins, and the fabulous Viveca Lindfors as the  creative writing prof.  Learn how to to shotgun a beer using nothing more  than a towel and a pen.  Marvel at the fact that Daphne Zuniga actually had  some respect for herself before MELROSE PLACE.
  THE SURE THING is funny  and sweet and smart and just plain good for you.  Somebody get out some  poster board and markers and let's march or something.  Ready?  All  together now:  We want THE SURE THING!

981542,5,6305181381,"One of my top 10 favorites. Well acted by all. Meet several famous actors before they were famous. Well directed; in my humble opinion, Rob Reiner's best. Beautifully written. The ending is perfect! A voice for decency, for  morality, in the ongoing culture wars. A loud voice against casual sex and  for romance!
