6853242,2,B00Q2OQNEU,"I'm gonna have to say that cropping the original episodes so that the ""fit"" a modern HDTV is a travesty and mark this down by 2 stars to 3.  Regardless of how great the picture looks or how the audio sounds, original aspect ratio goes both ways.  For movies, 2.35:1 will have bars on the top and bottom.  For TV, it means anything before the 90s is going to be 1:33 to 1 with bars on the sides.

Don't be fooled!  Buy the definitive edition or stick to the DVDs!  Battlestar Galactica (1978) was shot for television for 1978, not for theaters!  What you will see on this blu-ray will be the original episodes CROPPED for your HDTV, meaning you will not be seeing the top and bottom 15% of the show!

As for the show, read the other reviews.  If you grew up when this was on, you are probably a fan.  If you're less than 40, you probably won't like it.",1417305600,27,851,4.1656441717791415

6853269,4,B00Q2OQNEU,"I used to watch Battlestar Galactica when it was on the air, but to tell the truth, the 1980 series was more interesting That both of the original series, both starring Lorne Greene, are now on Blu Ray is great, but remember, this series is derivative and Glen Larson's attempt to emulate the success of Star Wars on television. The Cylons in this series are not as complex, nor as advanced, as the Cylons in the more recent series, and the cost of special effects when this series was made created problems for everyone. The writing's not great -- though some of the characters showed promise -- and the pilot film was far better than the series ever was. But, seeing this again made me wonder whatever happened to some of the actors and actresses with prominent roles on the show. As a science fiction fan, I enjoyed the show; as a critic of science fiction, I can see its flaws and problems more clearly now than back when it was on television.",1433548800,,947,4.479768786127168
6853270,2,B00Q2OQNEU,"I am not going to review BSG as a series, you are interested in this set because you love the show. My review is for the Blu-Ray set which I will say right off that you should go for The Definitive set is well worth it! The series is NOT meant to be seen in widescreen! The feature film (and the pilot by default) is the only thing that was meant to be seen in widescreen. The feature film was shot with 1.85:1 in mind for a theatrical release and was meant to be matted to 1.85:1 (trimming the top and bottom and opening up the sides) but was also protected for TV (opening up the top & bottom and trimming the sides to achieve 1.33:1, the TV ratio of the time). The feature film (in the Definitive Collection) is also a different edit (and better IMO) than the pilot version. Once you get to the first episode ""Lost Planet Of The Gods"" The widescreen framing looks wrong. (Examples included with this review) Heads are cut off, framing looks unnatural and cramped, and things are cut off in general. I went back and started watching everything in ""full frame"" 1.33:1 (only available in The Definitive Collection) where everything looks like it should. I am totally against faking widescreen which is the case here. However, the picture quality is outstanding! Sharp and colorful. There are some grainy shots, but if they use DNR to remove grain, it destroys detail and causes ""smearing"", so grain is the lesser of 2 evils. Keep in mind this was a TV show made in the 70s with lots of visual effects. Some shots are still going to have dirt and scratches that can't be removed, but a lot of the major damage has been removed as shown in the special feature ""Battlestar Galactica: Remastered"". My other gripe with this set is the ""5.1"" audio. It was lazily ""mixed"". If a proper 5.1 mix can't be done, leave it in it's original mono or stereo (In the case of the BSG series, mono) It sounds like the dialog was put in the center where it (for the most part) belongs. But it sounds like the effects and music were just spread into the left & right with little or no mixing / panning and with faked ""stereo"". This is really annoying when a viper flies from one side of the screen to the other and the audio stays in both the left and right channel with no left to right panning. It's also annoying that when Muffet barks and it comes from the left and right channel when it should be centered. These are just a couple of examples but the audio over all is like this for BSG. I would have been happier if the original mono audio was included. I know it's an older TV show and all the original elements may be lost making it impossible for a proper 5.1 mix. The original Star Trek series has a fantastic 7.1 mix, but all the original elements must have existed for them to do that. All the gripes aside, this is a significant upgrade from the DVDs, but go for The Definitive Collection that includes the ""Full Frame"" version of the series. The feature film is included in the Definitive set and is the ONLY BSG that is made for widescreen. The feature film includes the original mono ""Sensurround"" (2.1) which packs a powerful punch when you have a killer sub-woofer hooked up to your system. So in a nutshell, Movie is great in widescreen and 2.1 audio, From ""Lost Planet Of The Gods"" on should be viewed in 4x3 ""full Frame"" and NOT widescreen (examples given in pics), 5.1 audio on BSG is annoying at times. Picture quality over all is excellent. Go for Battlestar Galactic: The Definitve collection and NOT the remastered collection.",1432252800,156,3531,4.425499231950845

The Bad: Remastered does not mean restored. Any imperfections on the film were digitally preserved on disc. I was hoping they might upgrade the special effects, like what was done to Star Trek: The Original Series. No such luck. I have not watched all the Extras, but the deleted scenes and outages were nothing to write home about.

WHICH BLU RAY VERSION IS FOR YOU?:  Major fans will have already hashed and rehashed this.  However, here is the very simple perspective.  If you want to see the program mainly as it aired, in Full Screen (older square-ish format), that is only in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Definitive-Collection/dp/B00Q2OQNCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Definitive Collection</a>&nbsp;which has both Widescreen and Full Frame versions and includes the additional 1979 movie theater edit of the TV pilot episode called ""Saga of a Star World"" (slightly different edit with more final ending).  However, if you don't mind some slight cropping at top and bottom, and you don't want the theater version of the pilot, then the cheaper ""Remastered Collection"" on this page is all you need. ***Note that though the Widescreen has minor cropping top and bottom, it gains some picture width on each side (not viewable in the original Full Frame) as they take advantage of the overshoot on the film stock to widen the frame. So it's a give and take either way.  ***More on the cropping below.*** ---Both sets include Galactica 1980

REVIEW INTRO: Shortly after Star Wars ushered in a new era of special effects, there was a rush to get new space sagas onto the small screen.  As a result, Battlestar Galactica is one of our great milestones in TV Sci Fi.  It was made in the 70's, so of course there's a little 70's acting shmultz.  But, the 70's bent is part of its charm in a way.  This show ages surprisingly well because of the quality of story and character development.  The mythology speaks to a deeper part of the human soul and captivates our imagination.  As a young boy, I was obsessed!

BASIC STORY (no spoilers):  From the pyramid skyscrapers of home world Caprica, to the undiscovered worlds of space,  this is one of our seminal tales of space saga.  --  Humans in a system of planets with twelve colonies have been enemies for a thousand years with a cybernetic race called Cylons.  These Cylons have now sued for peace and celebrations are planned throughout the planetary systems.  However, this peace accord is only a ruse (aided by the human traitor Baltar)  to mask an approaching invasion force bent on their annihilation.  The war vessel Battlestar Galactica catches the attack early and manages to survive the holocaust along with a ragtag fleet of 220+ civilian vessels filled with survivors from all twelve colonies.  Together they will travel throughout the universe in search of a fabled Thirteenth Colony on a planet called Earth.  This so they can bolster their numbers and survive as the human race.  They seem to be guided by the Lords of Kobol themselves and thwarted by a force darker than the Cylons.  Along the way, they will find countless worlds holding clues to where the Thirteenth Colony went many millennia ago.  They will also encounter many species and learn more of the Lords of Kobol, who are god-like and associated with the mother race for all humans.

CHARACTERS:  One of the things that make this show so durable are its outstanding characters.  Yes, the acting can be a little shmultzy, but that is normal for the 70's and a prime-time series viewed by a wider age group.  Loren Green leads the cast as the elder statesman and commander of the remaining Battlestar.  It is a tale of his family with son Apollo rising in his footsteps.  Starbuck is the lovable rake that everyone seems to love best despite his mischief.  Jane Seymour plays beautiful Serina, who becomes Apollo's love interest.  Lucifer is the envious and impetuous robot who plays second fiddle to the human traitor Baltar.  Sheeba is the kick butt female fighter pilot.  And of course, the now mythical cylons themselves with that monotone voice, eerie cyclops eye that burns red and waves from side to side with that warbling sound!

THE MYTHOLOGY:  The show has a very strong mythology borrowed from many ancient religions and cultures, as well as from some relatively new ones.  This is not a religious program and no one against that should be put off.  However, the use of these mythologies is brilliant because it speaks to such a primal part of the human consciousness.  The twelve colonies (tribes) are clearly Israelite inferences while Egyptian and Greek images and dress and architecture are copied immensely.  The Counsel of the Twelve - very Christian.  Still, it's done in a way to create structure and story.  It is wholesome for a family show, but not preachy in any way.  It is first and foremost Sci-Fi.

REMASTER AND BLU-RAY REVIEW:  Keep in mind this is all in context of a show over 35 years old so one can't expect it to be exactly like releases of new Sci-Fi.  This is also a remaster and not a full restoration with cleaning.  That said, this is a clear improvement over the older releases with crisper details and brighter colors that are still reasonably natural tone.  For a program with so many dark scenes on ship bridges or deep space, I actually felt lucky that the dark scenes still looked as good as they did.  Deep space shots of nebula (in special effects) can still look a little fuzzy but certainly better than before.  When actually looking at real objects even in dark scenes, there is way less grain than there could have been.  I still saw a little more grain looking at a few shots of Galactica from the outside in space, but it was not bad given the dark scene and the age of the film.  Luckily they didn't do too much DNR in my opinion and I can still see pores on people's faces if reasonably close.  I did notice there are still many small film artifacts and an occasional hair thin yellow streak now and then.  The artifacts are definitely on both Widescreen and Full Frame, but are more noticeable on the Widescreen version.  A few of the more harsh artifacts I saw on the Widescreen were not in the Full Frame version (again, frame by frame comparison), which was a little strange.  Also, the larger your TV, the more noticeable it will be.  The sound is also a great improvement and there is separation.  But again, it's an old source so it won't be just like a new Sci-Fi movie.  It's much better than before, but it's not going to be reference quality.  Overall I am very happy and breathing a sigh of relief.  I have seen much worse restorations that were from shows a decade later than this.  I have seen dark scenes in other movie restorations that look like bad VHS (not the case here).  It is also important to note that despite some obscure rumors, there is no CGI enhancement of special effects.

ABOUT THE CROPPING ON THE WIDESCREEN VERSION:  I ran frame by frame comparisons and there is cropping on the widescreen to get that length though they also take advantage of the overshoot on original film stock to get even more length and minimize the amount of cropping necessary top and bottom.  It's not  going to make a huge deal, but it could make a difference to more particular fans.  In really close scenes when viewing a pilot in the cockpit, the frame can cut off higher parts of the helmet design of the pilot.  When the camera pans to show screen readouts that the pilot see's, some detail might be cut off.  In one scene for example, I could see an entire freighter on the cockpit diagram in full screen mode, but in widescreen it cut a noticeable part of the bottom off.  Conversely, the width you gain in Widescreen from overshoot will show side details not in the Full Frame version.  The opening scene with the council around a table will show the outer wall layers creating a natural picture frame effect (you do see the whole room and characters though).  This would not be viewable in the original TV broadcast or the Full Frame version Blu Ray.  As I said, it's a trade off and a matter of personal preference.  I will post more on this later.  If you really prefer watching in widescreen and don't mind a little snipping top and bottom, this version is a cheaper option.

FINAL THOUGHTS: Though the special affects will seem dated to new viewers, they were part of that groundbreaking revolution in their day.  Be forgiving of the ticky-tac stuff and appreciate this show for the milestone and accomplishment that it was.  From the dark regions of space, the engaging mysticism, to the fighter jocks with gunslinger like laser pistols on their hips, this show has so many elements to entertain and captivate.",1417910400,35,9443,4.805710738671633

8690089,3,B00Q2OQNEU,"I was excited to read the Re-Mastering for Blu-Ray was coming out of Battlestar Galactica: The Original Series. I already have the Film Blu-Ray, which looks as good as it can, which is much better than this Re-master. That stated, compared to the Film Blu-Ray, the first 3 episode SAGA of the TV series (essentially the same as the film) looks very challenged. It is very pixelated... like whomever remastered it, enlarged it from a DVD copy (480) to be 1080. It is very noticeable to my eye. That stated... many may not care as long as it fit's better on today's screens. I found it amusing that one of the opening shots of the Battlestar Atlantia actually shows where the stand of the model was 'keyed' out for the effects shot. LOL... All of that stated... I am still happy I have this, but I believe it could have been done much, much cleaner. This may have been a hurried process. I have attached a direct Screen Capture of the scene I have described above. I added my logo so I know it came from my review. So... This isn't a bad review, but not a good one either.",1525651200,,1070,4.355
