8094207,4,B000BYAEVU,"I liked this movie quite a bit... it is so refreshing to see people act ""natural and unaffected"", as this is so different from the arrogant ""stilted"" way that characters usually act in modern-day films.  I also enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the friendly and pleasant way that everyone in the movie treated each other.  And I thought it was very clever how the moviemakers ""blended"" several separate films into one by using an actor in one movie to ""tell a story about something that happened in the past"" by showing another movie, as if the separate portions of footage were all originally intended to be connected together in a single film, like interviews in a documentary.  I never even guessed or realized that this film was actually a combination of several different movies when I originally watched it --- I had to actually read about this fact in an article about the movie before I noticed anything unusual.  A first-class job.",1184803200,2,940,4.783950617283951
