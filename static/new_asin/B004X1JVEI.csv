8445817,5,B004X1JVEI,"This film clearly depicts great film making at work.  The director was able to get into a ""zone"" in which he was able to document all those intimate moments that are comical, bizarre, disturbing and also emotional.  There is a raw quality to this film that allows the viewer to see moments that are captured and not contrived.  I cannot wait to see more work from Greg Kohs.  He really is an amazing story teller.",1386720000,,413,4.466666666666667
8445818,5,B004X1JVEI,I absolutely loved this movie.  This film maker did a spectacular job capturing this story and the people involved.  I truly hope this film catches the eye of a large distributor that can get it the recognition it deserves.,1330300800,2,223,4.6923076923076925
8445819,2,B004X1JVEI,"I had waited a long time for this dvd to become available for sale.  Then when I finally purchased it from Amazon it was a waste of money for me.  It was not what I expected at all - and I am so disappointed.  First of all I did not want to see Mike Sardina in his underpants in the first scene and I did not want to hear the family fighting and shouting at each other and using the ""f"" word very freely.  I had hoped to see more of their singing instead of their troubled personal life - but suppose that is their story.  I wish I would NOT have spent $24.95 buying it.
I would rather have just bought a cd of their music as I was a fan of theirs and even went to Mr Sardinas funeral.
The photo on the front cover was very attractive - but the content was not !!",1311206400,,763,3.8343949044585988
