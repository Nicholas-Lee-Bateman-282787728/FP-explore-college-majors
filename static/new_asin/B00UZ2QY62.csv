7071974,5,B00UZ2QY62,"This movie is very good.  I really can't say much about this story, it's truly worth the watch!",1444694400,,95,4.277777777777778
7071975,4,B00UZ2QY62,I loved this film.  It rang true except for +SPOILER ALERT+ HIV piece with the young guy not relating his status to his girlfriend.  That wasn't in his character and merely used as a convenience to wrap up the movie.,1442448000,,216,4.375
7071976,4,B00UZ2QY62,This is a Dramedy with great acting (and full frontal).,1442188800,,55,4.6
7071977,4,B00UZ2QY62,This was a good movie.  Different. Sweet.  Funny.  The characters were human-- not perfect.,1442016000,,91,5.357142857142857

7071980,1,B00UZ2QY62,"I wish I understood why films like this are made. Sometimes I think it's part of the stigma against gay men with thinking like: let's show how easy it is to abuse and use a pathetic gay man and get away with it. The only redeeming quality in the story is that the abuser is so lost in self-abuse, he abuse everyone.

I'm disappointed in the French; they're usually smarter, real, and socially sensitive.",1433894400,4,403,4.445945945945946
7071981,4,B00UZ2QY62,It well done  with subject and budget  they had  realistic too,1433548800,,62,4.454545454545454

8708777,1,B00UZ2QY62,"I was merely curious to see this on Amazon when THIS film was touted in the blurb (cover photo included) on HALLMARK - yes - Hallmark! It turned out to be a fluffy Nicolette Sheridan piece, as befitting the channel, that actually aired.

Meanwhile, I couldn't get past 3 seconds of the opening scene before I went to the reviews to find out if there would be anything redeeming. Apparently not. Only friends of the filmmakers seem to give good reviews, but can't even muster any words to justify their 5 stars. This is clearly not worth watching for me or any decent human being from any country as far as I can tell. Which is exactly 3 seconds of film, maybe 10 minutes of reading reviews.",1501545600,,690,4.433070866141732
8708778,2,B00UZ2QY62,"Unfortunately, I'm one of the few who really didn't like this movie.

I found it very unbelievable that two seeming decent people (Henry and Audrey) would both fall for Lucas (the hustler).  For me, there were to many wasted scenes in the movie that didn't really have much to do with the plot, and I didn't really think any of the characters had any chemistry.  See Lucas with both Henry and Audrey...I wasn't buying it.  To me, he looked like a dirty meth head...and in the movie I felt he had an attitude that he was much better looking than he actually was.  I will say he (Lucas)  did great sex scenes...and there were quite a few of those in this movie...and I'm sure that is also helping sway people's opinions.

I won't even touch the topic of food handling in that bakery!  LOL

I will say it's not the worst movie I've seen...but there is just something about it that turned me off.  If you are reading my review...I would encourage you to give it a chance...most people do seem to enjoy it...so I'm the odd duck out on this film.",1500163200,,1040,4.369791666666667

8708781,1,B00UZ2QY62,"A scrawny, scruffy, bug-eyed, straight, twenty-something, HIV-positive, gay-for-pay porn performer and hustler in Argentina cons a fat, lonely, middle-aged gay baker in Belgium into paying for his flight from South America to Europe, promising to fulfill the baker's every fantasy and desire. Once there, he steals from the baker, verbally abuses him, refuses to have sex with him, and chases after the baker's assistant, a seemingly well-adjusted and sensible widowed mother his own age who has a son around six years old.

SPOILERS:

An hour and a half later, after a whole bunch of stupid crap (including the woman's leaving her son in the care of the skanky guy from Argentina while she goes to a party--right after he showed her some of the gay porn he appeared in--and an EXTREMELY offensive scene in which the scrawny hustler makes the fat baker run and exercise in a park while he ridicules him the whole time), the baker ends up with a partner much more like himself (for which the skanky hustler somehow gets credit, as if he's a messiah who came in order to solve everybody's problems), the single mom evidently abandons her son and chases the skanky, HIV-positive Argentine hustler to the skanky bar where he bartends between tricks, and they make out like monkeys in heat. THE END.

It's been a very long time since I hated a movie as much as I hate this one.",1458259200,4,1372,4.756302521008403
8708782,4,B00UZ2QY62,Enjoyed this one......bet these type relationships borne from cam show sites etc happen more than is imagined in industrialized countries.  Very well acted and totally believable...especially when two opposites are thrown together and must hash through the realities of their choice.  Good movie.,1458000000,,296,5.8604651162790695
8708783,5,B00UZ2QY62,"Yikes!  Why do you find most films like this linked up with gay films?  In spite of the content I would say that this is about life itself, perhaps though not of the rich & famous.  The acting, direction & such is quite terrific.  In a week of the release of yet another Star Wars film I was delighted to find myself watching this. It is a perfect chronicle of how unperfect life is.  It celebrates the manner in which humanity rises & falls in the worst moments to unexpected heights.  We are not pretty & that sometimes is what leads us to be poetic & beautiful.  Who can understand this, but to express that in a film may be the highest peak that any director can reach.",1450915200,,673,4.2109375
