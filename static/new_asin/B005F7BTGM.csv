8469691,2,B005F7BTGM,"was super excited to finally find this film. James Marsters is one of my favorite actors. However, I won't be able to watch this any time soon because, not only is it a Region 2(which was stated NOWHERE when I purchased it), the back part that gives you a hint of what the film is supposed to be about is in a language I can't read. That would have been nice to know as well. one can only hope that there is an English option on the actual dvd, but I won't be able to find out for quite some time. Really upset and would recommend NOT purchasing from this buy without at least reading EVERYTHING VERY CAREFULLY. Still, definitely let them know if something's wrong, which is exactly what I'm doing.",1381968000,,698,4.295454545454546
