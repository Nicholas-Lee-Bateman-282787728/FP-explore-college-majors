8500737,5,B006MGWBZ8,Outstanding one man show (well two-man show). The production and direction are extremely well done.,1488931200,,99,5.666666666666667
8500738,4,B006MGWBZ8,"Back in my late teen years, my best friend and I listened to a cassette tape of the original musical over and over.  We knew it by heart and loved it, seeing it on stage a few times as two young Canadian friends who could have fought in that war, if we lived at that time.  Watching a movie of the play, I did not know what to expect.  I felt luke warm about it until around half way through and during the number with the French singer ""Did he get out alive? No! - No! He did not survive"" it really turned for me and it worked. I really loved it.  They did cut some precious bit out, like his British benefactor lady commenting on the smell of his shaving lotion and Cedric, but it felt like they did a great job.  And there are some great visual aids like the films and one bitter sweet surprise at the end.  So I feel it's well worth a watch.  All those old songs I had forgot, came right back to me with a poignancy long forgotten, in a commentary on World War I as good as any personal story from that war.",1426464000,,1011,3.9752475247524752
8500739,5,B006MGWBZ8,Really entertaining version of the life of a Canadian war hero.,1418515200,,63,4.818181818181818
8500740,5,B006MGWBZ8,"A great productuon, story, acting staging...basically a one man show about the psychology of an ordinary man who became a war hero and then went home. oh, yeah, it's Canadian and the war is WWI.",1386720000,,194,4.571428571428571
8500741,4,B006MGWBZ8,"I acquired this movie for my Grade 12 students.  We read the play, including the prologue, so they all knew what to expect.  I wish there had been a recording of the original performances when the actors first presented the play.  However, replayed when the actors were much older, the play took on a slightly different perspective and it fostered good discussion.  Unfortunately there were some parts omitted in this version and my students were slightly disappointed by the exclusion of the scene about being told to eat a spider (among others).  While this still made a good movie, some of the minor omissions had made the play a good read.  I rated this by how attentive my students were.  Our school hosts the villages annual Remembrance Day service and we watched the movie a few weeks before.  I think my class was struck by the reflectiveness in the more mature ""Billy Bishop.""  Both the play and the movie have purpose and promote thoughtfulness.  If one were just looking for an evening's entertainment, this might not be it.",1385164800,,1035,4.764044943820225
8500742,4,B006MGWBZ8,"This is the first video of this play I have found in years of searching. It is an updated version to allow for the age of the two actors and is very good.  There are a few bits of the original production that have been either written or edited out of this version.  Most do not make much difference, but a few leave out lead-ins to later parts of the play.  For instance, the discription of Cedric the butler is left out. So, when Cedric is refered to at the end of the scene one wonders who he is. I was able to follow along with the printed version of the play, which helped fill in the gaps.
All-in-all I'd say its a Hell of a good time.",1375401600,3,640,3.984375
8500743,5,B006MGWBZ8,"This movie is a filming of a famous Canadian one man play about Billy Bishop.  Bishop was a famous World War 1 flying ace credited with shooting down more enemy planes than any other pilot during the war except for Rene Fonck and the Red Baron.  The movie tells the story of how Bishop worked his way out of the infantry and into the flying corps, his battles in the air and eventual retirement from service.

The movie is well shot, but really just a filmed version of the play.  As such, you should not expect to see actual aerial combat or historical reenactments of Bishop's life.  Instead you will see Bishop reminiscing about his life while he drinks in a bar and sings songs with the pianist. The story can be sad at times and funny at others (in a black humor sort of way).

It stars the original stage actor Eric Peterson, who I saw perform this play about 20 years ago in Toronto. While much older, Peterson still has a great presence.
Overall, the movie is well worth watching, as long as you go in with the expectation of seeing a play instead of a traditional movie.  It was a great play and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it again.",1359244800,2,1142,4.3584905660377355
