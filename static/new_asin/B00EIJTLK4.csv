5915458,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Star Trek is on Blu-Ray.
Band of Brothers is on Blu-Ray.
For Christ's sakes, the far inferior Friends is on Blu-Ray!

Seinfeld might be the greatest comedy of all time but $150 for 33 discs is ridiculous, GIVE THE FANS THE BLU-RAY!!!!",1383350400,82,234,4.571428571428571
5915459,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Vandelay Industries, a low talker, a high talker, the soup Nazi, The marble rye, the big salad, dockers pants, the puffy shirt (I don't want to look like a pirate!""),  ""Who puts on your pants?"" ""Somebody stole my wallet!"" ""These pretzels are making me thirsty."" ""You gotta see the baaaaby.""""You double-dipped the chip!""

It's really amazing how soooo many words, catch phrases and remarks from this show are so memorable.

Whoa, what about this, ""a coffee table book about coffee tables!""

A gem of a show about absolutely nothing and everything too.  Not too many shows can one say that about.

To fans of this show critics may say Yada, Yada, Yada, but Seinfeld fans know better.

Serenity now!",1379289600,16,696,4.798319327731092
5915460,5,B00EIJTLK4,"We all know what Seinfeld is about and there are reviews and opinions written ad nauseam about the show. Of course it's great to have the complete series all together, but why has Sony chosen to re-release the entire series on DVD only, when many series (even the 53 year old Dick Van Dyke Show is now on blu-ray) are getting complete box sets on blu-ray? Is this a last ditch effort to dump all their old DVDs before the blu-ray set is actually released? For me, the best way to watch Seinfeld is in widescreen HD on TBS. Hopefully, a blu-ray set is going to be released soon with the option to view the original 4:3 aspect ratio and the widescreen 16:9 ratio to satisfy everybody.",1379030400,38,682,4.377952755905512

5915546,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Back in the early 90s I was watching ROSEANNE, MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN but never had the urge to catch SEINFELD, even when it really caught fire around 1993 and exploded into Pop Culture. This show was on everyones lips and when I was working in the Electronics Dept. of a major department store, more than once a VCR was brought in for repair with a tape stuck in it, with a handwritten SEINFELD on the label. Since it went off the air in 1998, I have seen bits and pieces of it at peoples homes due to its constant rerun rotation, and was finally tempted to check it out from start to finish after a respected blogger gave a season-by-season critique.

I went with the Complete Series release from 2013 that I grabbed for a good price and finished the entire set in 6 weeks. While it still will never be one of my Top Ten favorites, I can see why it earned its place in Pop Culture. SEINFELD had that certain something that transcends the typical sitcom genre, which accounts for its huge success. It was able to capture such a broad demographic because the absurdist humor appealed to viewers who generally wouldnt watch sitcoms. SEINFELDs popularity spawned copycats like ELLEN and THE DREW CAREY SHOW, but none of them could replicate that crazy comedic genius of the New York Four.

The characters are types viewers had never seen on TV before and their trivial adventures were unique to TV at the time, yet relatable to the audience. George and Kramer were the standouts and funniest characters, with Elaine there to provide the female viewpoint. Jerry Seinfeld, like Roseanne, was wise to surround himself with such talented actors. I LOVE Estelle Harris as Georges motherTHAT VOICE!!!I think the show really hit its stride with Season 3 and of course 4 and 5 are the pinnacle. IMO Season 9 is much more comedically satisfying than 7 or 8 and THE SOUP NAZI must be one of TVs most overrated episodes ever.

I love the book-style packaging for this set. Too bad Sony didn't use this for their other sets like CHARLIES ANGELS or BEWITCHED which used those horrible cheap black plastic spindles with stacked discs. Terrific DVD set with wonderful extrasget it for yourself or for gift-giving!",1500163200,,2206,4.665809768637532

Season 2 ""Disc 1"" as it is labelled on the page is actually labelled Season 2 ""Disc 2"" on the disc. The first and second season are the only ones which have mislabeled disc numbers. If you look on the disc tho they do properly tell you which episodes of the season they cover. As for the dvd case all the sleeves are cardboard but they are better than other reviewers seem to think. They seem like theyd do a fine job. I bought dvd cases because I was paranoid about the other reviewers saying it was a bad case.

It's because I did NOT get the playing cards, salt and pepper shakers, etc... JUST THE DVDs. I'm okay with it, I guess. I would've liked the playing cards in particular, but at least my discs did arrive all accounted for and undamaged... I'm definitely keeping the set, but I do think you should get what is advertised... just saying. So heads up if you order this set, you might not get what you're expecting.",1493251200,,584,4.625

The casing for the discs is interesting and a novel space saving idea but would not recommend storing the disc in there if you are going to be constantly removing them.

Love the humor and the reality of life situations that are just not worth the stress we endore. Jerry can make any situation in life a human comedy.  The humor is the absurdity of man and the importance he attaches to mundane things.  The characters could not have been better chosen.

5915617,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Hard to believe it's been nearly 20 years since ""Seinfeld"" wrapped production after a nine year run.  Admittedly I was not a devoted fan during it's broadcast years, in '89 I'd just started a demanding grad school program so didn't really watch much TV and it wasn't until '91 or so that the show was even on my radar.  Decided to take the plunge and invest in this DVD collection and watch all the episodes from the beginning and in doing so can conclude there's a reason that ""Seinfeld"" earned it's success.

  It's just funny, the mundane situations in the hands of Jerry and his cast of clowns are comedy gold.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards, and Jason Alexander are all just brilliant in their self-absorbed characters making the series hold up well after two decades.  The supporting cast is equally terrific and the chemistry between them all can't be beat.  There are so many stand-out episodes; my personal favorite is from Season 4, Episode 12, ""The Airport"" where Jerry and Elaine flying back to NY get bumped.  They are given the option of another flight but there's only one seat in First Class and the other's in Coach.  Naturally Jerry gets the premium seat and Elaine's stuck in steerage compartment hell.  The juxtaposition between the two experiences (Jerry seated next to a supermodel swilling wine's from the Tuscany region while Elaine's sandwiched between two obese guys) is laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Also seeing some of the young actresses who play Jerry's girlfriends who later go on to become greater stars is quite entertaining- you forget how many there actually were.

  In fact, the only disappointment is the finale episode which has to rate as one of the worst in TV history.  That aside, this collection provides many hours of laughs and is well worth adding to your home DVD library.",1486771200,,1825,4.876623376623376

5915620,1,B00EIJTLK4,"Hopefully anyone reading the 1-star reviews will really, thoroughly check they have all the disks when this arrives, as other reviewers have suggested. There are 33 disks. That's a lot to check, especially when some of the disk labels do not even match what is in the disk sleeves. I found out the hard way that Season 6 Disk 2 was just not in the box when purchased new, by my wife, as a gift. I had to order it on eBay.

You're probably not going to watch all 33 disks before the 30-day return window expires. I would suggest taking them all out of the sleeves and checking. Note that Season 2 is completely mislabeled. The sleeve says Season 2 Disk 1, 2 & 3 while the DVDs say Season 2 Disk 2, 3 & 4. There is no Season 2 Disk 1 but there is a Season 2 Disk 4.

1-star not reflecting on the content, which is Seinfeld, and brilliant. In fact, I half suspect the missing disks are a marketing ploy because it is just the kind of thing you can hear George complaining about to Jerry. :)",1486598400,,987,4.135416666666667

We enjoyed the whole series twice in a row  =] and have not had a chance to see all the bonus materials yet - there is so much on these CDs - really great for the price we paid.  No issues with the CDs.  We were worried about the packaging based on other reviews because people did not like it and said the CDs were scratched and would not play.  We had no such problems and in fact like the packing very much.  It is compact and of good quality.  With all the clutter we already have in the house, I'd hate to have more bulky packaging for all those CDs.  It is very convenient with episode information and numbering on each sleeve and sturdy cardboard, covered with a smooth surface, so I think our CDs will be fine and the whole package will last a long time, even with repeated use.

the strange thing is for the season two section, the sleeves are numbered 1-3, but the actual discs are numbered 2-4, and even stranger  ( but to my relief ), the 5 episodes on disc two match up with the first 5 episodes on disc 1. hm. i'm satisfied.

and who knew there were only 5 episodes in season 1? i'm going to double check the episode list on wikipedia.

the picture quality is a bit grainy ( on season 2 disc 2, as that's the one i was checkingout ), but it's watchable.

good price for a complete series with 9 seasons, & worth the buy.",1473206400,2,772,4.052631578947368

The Seinfeld series happened during the 90s when we, as a nation, had such prosperity - I wish the series could come back, even recreating the cast as middle aged, married with children and in Long Island or Florida or something.  Maybe use Veep as the launch vehicle?  There was never such a magic troupe of comedians as those four plus Larry David.  I continue to be in awe!

The kitchy extras can best be described as random - the ceramic salt and pepper set from Monk's diner with the small napkin holder and real napkins?  The puffy shirt? The kid's card deck?  To the re-gift closet!",1469318400,2,805,4.355704697986577

5915758,2,B00EIJTLK4,"Lets start by saying that the show itself is awesome, and the DVD set is so far good.

The bad:
Everything but the DVDs in this box is absolute garbage.
The ""puffy white shirt"" piece arrived completely broken. The case is intact but the shirt and the little round pendant that is glued above the photo were broken off and loose in the case. The case cannot be opened since it is sealed plastic and thus there is no way to repair the thing.

The little napkin dispenser with shakers was mostly intact, though the bottom piece had broken off during shipping. Without it the holder was bent and had to be sort of bent back to reattach the bottom.

About the only thing that arrived intact was the deck of playing cards which come encased in what can be described as an altoids tin.

The DVD holder itself isn't great either. While it arrived intact, the holder is simply the glued paper cases/sleeved pages. They're rather cheap and probably won't hold up well long term. A few of the DVDs arrived with minor scratches, likely from the case itself. All of them play alright, but it is disappointing that something new arrived in such condition.",1468972800,4,1141,4.524271844660194

5915788,3,B00EIJTLK4,"Pros:

The entire series is wonderful! I love this sitcom and I have rewatched it again and again.
This set comes with bonus features and they are also great to watch.
The DVDs themselves are of good quality!

The actual content itself I would readily give a 5/5 rating, the only downside to me is the actual packaging.

Cons:

The case. It looks nice, but it's awful. When it comes to ""Complete Series"" collections, the case always seems to be the most questionable part.

The DVDs are held in sleeves that are held together with glue. Once you start flipping through the ""book"" style of sleeves, some of them will come apart and the DVD will fall and hit the glue. Even if the DVD doesn't fall, it may slip around. Disc 3 in Season 3 in my collection is now unplayable because of how much glue is on it.

To remedy this I have just purchased empty DVD cases and will have to clean every one of the discs (they all have glue on them, not as bad as that one disc yet). I will not be able to keep them in this original case any longer.",1462320000,4,1034,4.196969696969697

5915794,2,B00EIJTLK4,"Well, I love the packaging but I got tired of these characters very quickly. When I was only able to catch an occasional Seinfeld episode in reruns, I thought this show had some very funny moments.  After binge-watching the series for a few hours, I doubt if I will want to watch the whole set. These really are terrible human beings. They are annoying New Yorkers: whiny, self-absorbed, dishonest, shallow, materialistic, lacking in empathy, with no vital absorbing or transcending interests beyond their narrow little selfish concerns - that's who these people are. Add to that unappetizing mix a vulgar ease with discussing private bodily functions, an open misanthropy, and an obsession with the minor physical imperfections in others and you have some pretty horrible human beings. Seinfeld's stand-up routine is nothing more than Andy Rooney's essays about inanities repackaged as a stage act. Oftentimes, he's just plain ignorant. In one bit, he states that the only reason people work out in gyms is so they can get strong enough to do their gym routines - that working out serves no purpose outside of the gym. That is plain ignorance. People work out to lose weight, build bone mass, improve endurance, reap cardio benefits, increase lung capacity, strengthen their bad backs, do physical rehabilitation exercises to recover from accidents and falls, etc. If Seinfeld doesn't understand something, he mocks it, not realizing that he may be parading his ignorance in front of those who do understand what he finds so baffling. His humor shows how stupid he is. The next time Seinfeld wonders why movie theaters hold on to half your tickets, why cereal boxes aren't filled to the top, and why cows graze on grass most of their waking hours, he should do some research and stop making jokes about things he is too poorly educated and stupid to understand.
Most of the ""humor"" in this show's storylines come from the characters lying, manipulating, deceiving, and even stealing from others. In other words, they are dishonest, lying thieves. They don't feel guilty about being such scumbags, although they are neurotic about almost everything else that most normal people don't worry about. The characters have very low tolerance (actually, zero) for the human foibles and weaknesses of others, but constantly excuse their own. There's a deep misanthropy and contempt for others on display here. And yet the four main characters are so despicable that they themselves ARE deserving of contempt. Instead, they have a high regard for themselves that has no basis in reality.
Trying to watch several of these in a row left a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe it is a good thing that I am over Seinfeld.",1461628800,3,2700,4.986696230598669

Quite likely the most user friendly packaging I have seen in a box set. My only hesitation before buying was that I was hoping the series would come out in full HD on Blu Ray. Perhaps some day, once Jerry's sold all the DVDs he can, then he'll make another billion selling us all the Blu Ray version. Also, here's a way for Seinfeld to make another billion bucks: re-release the series without the sometimes annoying laugh track. I think it would be really interesting to experience it that way.

Unfortunately I gave it as a gift for Christmas, but the good news is it went to a family member so I have ample visitation rights.
Few TV shows are as epic as Seinfeld and the episodes just get better the more you watch them. Amazing how a show about nothing can be so wildly entertaining and for me (and most fans that I know) it never gets old. The show just gets better and better the more you watch it.
This collector's edition makes a great gift for someone you love or for yourself. Binge watch a season at a time!",1453939200,,785,4.275167785234899

As others have noted, the packaging for the DVD's is not the best,and that is why I gave the set 4 out of 5 stars.  The packaging does well to save space on the shelf, but that is about it. None of the disc had any scratches or problems playing. Instead of keeping the disc in the original packaging, I used 3 Maxtek Black 10 Disc Capacity DVD Cases with 4 Flip Trays and Outter Clear Sleeve cases ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C2FN95O?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 ) to house the individual disc.

5915909,5,B00EIJTLK4,"I've been wanting to purchase the Seinfeld series for many years.  I, like many, were waiting on the blu-ray release.  Well, after some digging into the HD release for I believe TBS I noticed they clipped a lot of the top and bottom of the original 4:3 picture to make it ""widescreen"" while adding some filler to the sides from I believe the original footage.  I looked at many side by side shots and feel the widescreen version simply crops too much as it just looks weird.  Although I'd much rather this be HD most blu-ray players will upconvert the picture for it to look pretty good.

As of the product and packaging, it's great!  I inspected each and every disk for glue and scratches based on other reviewers.  One disk has a small scratch and one disk was inserted upside down.  All the disks were correct and in the correct order.  I played the disk with the scratch, no problems at all.

The collectibles in this set are actually pretty cool.  The salt and pepper shaker are your standard size, maybe 3 inches or so.  The napkin dispenser is spring loaded like you'd expect and even has some napkin like product in it to give it the look and feel.  The puppy shirt, well it comes in it's normal box, but that then comes in a thin plastic box protector.

This entire set gets a 5 star review fro me, especially based on the price since I picked it up on a lightening deal for $50.00.  Way to go amazon, you made my day once again!",1451347200,31,1438,4.333333333333333

5915921,2,B00EIJTLK4,"This series is 5* easy, the packaging...errr not so much, let me explain why.

The set comes in a nice hard cardboard box that does seem fairly sturdy, however once you slide the series out of that you know what you are in for. The disc's are housed in a HUGE digibook style book with the episode's on one side of the page, and an image of a cast member on the other side of the page, pretty cool look, but once you slide the disc's out you know what you are in for, and that is scratched disc's! Digibook format for DVD's is never really a good way to go as it will shorten the life of your DVD's dramatically, and more than likely upon arrival you will have several scratched disc's already in your set as you barely remove them for the first time. If you go with the series I'd get the individual release even though it will cost you more, at least the disc's have trays, otherwise this isn't a good option and alternatively you might be better off waiting for a Blu-ray release.",1450742400,5,982,4.223404255319149

The 1st one was the invidual dvd years then traded them in for the big box set with the book which I still have but they're in a bunch of pieces and some of the discs are either scratched missing in action as the set itself just fell apart because it was badly made...this one however is beautiful...each disc comes in a paper sleeve that reads like a book...eg season 1 has about 3-4 sleeves and on the back it has the episodes listing goes all the way through season 9 that way...then on the back cover is 1 bonus disc...the other bonus is on the season discs themselves and there's probably 100 hours like they said...also it's housed in a nice hard conglomerate type cardboard...not cheap carboard by any means it's kind of hard and it has a nice slipcase cover...yes they do include accessories which didn't really make the deal for me but you get a ketchup and mustard which are really salt and pepper shakers (If that makes sense) with a very small napkin holder I wouldn't plan on using the napkins unless your a ken and Barbie doll...the playing cards are smaller than most but a nice touch...the puffy shirt is just a talk piece but i'll put that in the china closet for now.,1450396800,30,1235,4.416666666666667

5915973,5,B00EIJTLK4,"What CAN you say?  Either you liked Seinfeld or you didn't.  Or maybe, just maybe you never actually watched it when it was running on TV for the first time.  Now is your chance to catch every single episode, along with (in most cases) a little preliminary commentary by either the actors or the writers, about how idea for the episode came to be, what they thought of it at the time, and so on.  The commentaries are short, not so long as to overwhelm the episodes themselves.  There are also sometimes extended scenes that had to be trimmed for the TV airing.

There are a LOT of episodes.  I am one who used to listen in while my wife watched it on TV.  I thought it was funny, but I missed a lot of the episodes when they first played.  Now I am enjoying going through them sequentially, as they aired season by season.  It's still as good today as it was then.",1442966400,,865,4.219512195121951

I was able to clean the glue off using a bottle of Goo Gone, some cotton balls, a microfiber cloth, and a bit of patience using this procedure:

* Put some Goo Gone on a cotton ball, then rub the cotton ball on the gluey spots.  They should start to dissolve pretty quickly.
* For more stubborn glue spots, put some Goo Gone on a cotton swab and put some force into the rubbing cotton tip on the disc.
* Follow up by wiping the disc with a clean microfiber cloth (from the inside ring to the outside).  You might have to do another application if there is glue-haze remaining.
* Make sure to use a new cotton ball or swab with each disc or you risk transferring and streaking the bigger glue blobs.

Using this procedure, my gluey discs came out almost flawless and scratch-free and played without any problems.  I put the discs into compact CD cases afterwards to make sure they didn't pick up any new glue spots.  Going through this process is not ideal, but the price of this DVD set is good and the discs have lots of extras to explore.",1434153600,18,1225,4.2094017094017095

The last four seasons of this highly overrated show were astonishingly stupid while the first two were mediocre at best. I willingly admit seasons 3,4,5 were pretty good with infrequent flashes of brilliance but the rest I can definitely do without. A television show that is supposedly spectacular and unforgettable should not lose creativity and steam after only five seasons and turn into an unwatchable, silly mess that rivals The Three Stooges for juvenile, nonsensical entertainment. To have the most boring, unimaginative, disappointing series finale in television history only adds to the Seinfeld, um, "" legacy "" that will hopefully fade away into obscurity after people finally realize what trash they've wasted their time viewing.",1429660800,2,830,5.343511450381679

5916095,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""Seinfeld"" was one of those series.  Of course, the Fab Four refers to Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld), Michael Richards (Cosmo Kramer), Jason Alexander (George Costanza), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Elaine Benes).  Completing the analogy, the fifth Beatle would be co-creator and head writer Larry David.  There's no need for me to describe the so-called show about nothing, or mention all of the catch phrases and words that became part of our vernacular, such as ""hoochie mama,"" ""no soup for you,"" ""not that there's anything wrong with that,"" ""shrinkage,"" ""that's a shame,"" and ""yada yada yada.""  I especially liked how the show maintained continuity with characters and storylines, which is lacking in many other series.  The important question is, after viewing the show repeated so many times in syndication, is it worth buying the complete series box set?  The answer is a resounding YES!

There are three episodes included in the box set that are NEVER shown in syndication.  The first one is ""The Handicap Spot,"" from season 4.  The box set includes the original episode, in which John Randolph played Frank Costanza.  After the great Jerry Stiller joined the cast as George's father, Larry David reshot scenes from that episode, replacing John Randolph with Jerry Stiller as Frank Costanza.  In the Season 9 episode ""The Betrayal,"" the action takes place backwards, in flashbacks.  The box set also includes ""The Betrayal"" in correct chronological order, from start to finish.  In addition, the box set includes ""The Puerto Rican Day"" episode from season 9.  That episode was pulled from syndication, because it contains a controversial scene involving the Puerto Rican flag.  In addition, the bonus features make the box set an essential purchase for all Seinfeld fans.  Many episodes have extended and deleted scenes that didn't make the final cut of the show.  Speaking of not making the final cut, there are many hilarious bloopers sprinkled throughout the box set.  Many episodes include ""Inside Looks,"" in which cast members and writers discuss a particular episode.  ""Notes About Nothing"" provide interesting facts about each episode.  Several episodes include insightful commentaries by cast members and writers.  Last but not least is the bonus disc of the roundtable reunion, in which Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Larry David reminisce about the show.  Be the master of your domain, and buy this box set today!",1429142400,4,2607,5.231325301204819
5916096,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Always enjoyed the Seinfeld series and this album of the complete series is perfect. I read  reviews from other purchasers and a common grip was the packaging.

It's certainly not really any better than Mash, Cheers, I Love Lucy, Frasier or any number of other shows considered the ""best"" of their time. And it has the most annoying soundtrack I've EVER heard. That shrill thumb-pop bass sample played over and over, and those ridiculous mouth popping noises are awful...

The pockets are poorly glued and some of the dvds are coming out of the package so I have to be very careful when putting them into their pockets so they don't go outside the pocket.  There is glue on some of the disks because of this cheap packaging, and I checked all of the disks that looked questionable when I first opened it (some did have scratches, most likely from the packaging and glue) and luckily, all of them played.  Its strange how this is supposedly an ""updated"" version of the dvd set, yet compared to the one released 2007, it is considerably poorer in quality--the 2013 version doesn't even come with a book!  But I suppose it does make the set cheaper.  At any rate, this 2013 version is pretty much the only option I had, aside from paying crazy prices on eBay for the 2007 version, but as far as being sold in no-nonsense packaging that gives you the series straight, its alright--at best.",1428451200,3,1095,4.566326530612245

5916120,3,B00EIJTLK4,"The series is, of course, five stars.  I'm giving it three to acknowledge the problems with the packaging that many have noted.  I found about 1/2 of the discs to have light scratching from the cardboard sleeve.  It doesn't look serious enough to affect playing, but I encourage anyone who enjoys repeated viewing to remove once and store in cases.

Likewise encountered the glue specks and smudges - on about 1/4 of the discs in my set.  However, I'm writing TO OFFER A SOLUTION to the glue issue that worked for me.  The trick I found is to dab a very soft tissue in nail polish remover, which contains acetone.  Apply gently and carefully only to the glue spot, rubbing with a little pressure (experiment for yourself) until the glue dissolves.  I then did the same thing with a tissue dabbed in rubbing alcohol to clean the disc.  To prevent spotting, lightly use a dry tissue to polish the disc as it evaporates.  In all cases my discs looked good as new..

On a positive note for the packaging, I appreciated the info supplied on the facing page for each disc.  And given that I purchased it as a deal of the week, to have the entire series at a substantially reduced price made it worth taking a chance on the condition.  Solving the glue issue makes getting it a no-brainer for anyone considering it if the deal comes up again.",1428019200,9,1335,4.4896265560165975
5916121,1,B00EIJTLK4,"This is just going to be an echo of countless other reviews. I love the Seinfeld series - absolutely a five star show. The packaging, however is abysmal. It really is insulting for companies to put out a significant release like this, only to have the packaging be complete trash like this. I had read the previous reviews lamenting the packaging and also making mention of some type of glue or adhesive that had wound up on the discs themselves - making some of them unplayable.

Knowing all of that, I only bought the set because it was cheap as the deal of the day. When my set arrived, it had probably six or seven discs with various amounts of the glue or adhesive on the data side. These discs were unplayable. Rather than send them back, I figured that I had nothing to lose, so I tried to get the adhesive off. Surprisingly, I was able to get every disc clean and playable by using Goof Off and letting it sit for about 15 minutes.

The box the discs come in is OK, b ut does a good job of chronicling all episodes and extras.  All discs that I've watched so far, maybe 10 - 15 percent, have looked and played perfectly.  Best thing -- my 14 year old son digs the show and it's given us something to talk about, which isn't easy at his age.  And even cooler, I ran into NEWMAN!

Of all time. So, yeah.) He thought that the packaging was ""genius"". The entire series fits into one case, slightly larger than that which was used to house use just one season of Game of Thrones. THE ENTIRE SERIES. I am deeply sympathetic towards those reviewers that faced great travesty and misfortune upon unveiling their own collections, but that was simply not the case in this household. No pun intended. (Ok, it's a little intended.) BUY THIS SERIES. (I am most definitely NOT a sponsored reviewer. My bank account can attest to that.) Seriously, just buy it.

5916184,4,B00EIJTLK4,"As far as I know, if you want to watch the entire Seinfeld series, your only options are to watch the reruns on TV or buy this boxed set. None of the online services are streaming this that I'm aware of.

The set comes with 33 discs so it's a large collection but it contains every episode ever aired. Like others have mentioned, the discs arrive in a large book that has a cardboard sleeve or ""page"" for each disc. It's not the best way to protect the discs but it's cheap which I suspect is the reason it was chosen.

Like others, a couple of my discs had minor scratches on them but so far there have been no issues with playback. DVDs are a little more tolerant of scratches that a Blu-ray disc for instance.

Others have complained that the set is not in HD, that's because it wasn't filmed in HD. If you're used to watching everything HD, you may be a little disappointed in the video quality, it's standard definition DVD quality.

Overall, I'm happy with it, there are maybe one or two Seinfeld episodes that I didn't really care for but I love the series and I can watch them whenever I want. What more can you ask for?

Also, the price has come down dramatically since it first went on sale, that's what prompted me to buy it.

Pros - Every Episode, lot's of extras (commentaries ,etc), great price.

Cons - Standard definition (that's how it was filmed, what are you gonna do?)",1424217600,2,1388,4.335907335907336

As a lot of people have pointed out, the packaging for these DVDs leaves much to be desired. I checked everyone one of the DVDs and made sure they were all there and no damage. Be careful getting the DVDs out of their sleeves as they may have worked themselves quite a ways in to the sleeve. Fold each sleeve over carefully so that none of the DVDs are damaged as you skim thru the ""book.""

5916286,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Hands down the best comedy sitcom of the 1990's.  I read somewhere that TV Guide or New York Times ranked Seinfeld in top-ten most popular/influential sitcoms of the past century.  It was the first sitcom basically about: NOTHING.  There is no plot-line or central character here.  The series revolves around a group of friends: Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer.  Three guys and one girl.  Jerry Seinfeld  co-wrote and co-produced the series with his friend and comedian Larry David.  The series is loosely based on the life of Larry David during his career as a stand-up comedian in New York City. In the 1970's David lived in a apartment building in the Midtown-West, and had a corky/hipster neighbor who lived next door to him, in the sitcom the neighbor is played by Michael Richards (Kramer).  Jerry Seinfeld plays the role of Larry David, Julia-Louis Dreyfus plays the character of Elaine Benes, who is an ex-girlfriend of Jerry, and Jason Alexander is George Costanza a childhood friend of Jerry.  Each episode starts off with Jerry doing a short comedy stand-up, with exception to the last two seasons, Each episode is about 30 minutes long and it involves the everyday life problems, love affairs, funny job situations, and you name it...it is a very down to earth comedy sitcom, which was filmed and produced in California.  However, the setting of the series is New York City.

The series is composed of 9 seasons.  According, to Jerry Seinfeld the number 9 symbolizes the number of years The Beatles were together before they split-up.  The sitcom lasted from 1989-1998.",1418601600,2,1583,4.946969696969697
5916287,5,B00EIJTLK4,Absolutely fantastic set of DVDs....no flaws in any one and the clarity is excellent.  After years of absence from tv the humor on Seinfeld is even more appreciated....far outshines anything currently offered on the networks.

I'm not one who normally watches the extras that are put into DVD movies and series, but what's included in this set is pretty interesting and entertaining to watch. Anyone who is a fan of the show would definitely enjoy the extras that come along with this package. The only con is that the video quality is still the same as it was filmed, so our ""HD spoiled standards"" make the lower video quality noticeable. That being said, the video quality concern doesn't take away from the viewing experience just because the show is that good. If you haven't seen the show, you must. The writing is fantastic, and there are no other shows like it. The character portrayal is some of the best, and the chemistry between them makes this one of the greatest shows of all time.",1417046400,3,885,4.435582822085889

My only problem with this set is how cheaply made it is. For such a great and much acclaimed series, you'd imagine they'd make sure the quality of this product was above average at least! The sleeves were stuck together, the adhesive from the sleeves binding clumps and sticks to the dvd's, and navigating the menu should've been simplified.

First thing I did upon opening the box was to check all CDs was in order and happy to see it was. Another complaint among reviewers is that the CDs are placed in sleeves.

But about 1/4 - 2/3 of the episodes don't play on my model 2013 blu-ray player (ie, a new-ish player) that has never had problems with other discs.  They've never played, since the first time I put the discs in the machine.  Some people have referred to scratching on the discs; I can't see any visible marks on them.  Obviously, my machine thinks differently; it makes terrible noises on some of the episodes, tries for about a minute, then gives up and returns to the menu.

Purchasing this series was a mistake, unfortunately.  I should have read other reviews.",1410048000,10,715,4.582677165354331

Every disc was there for each season and in the correct order, none were missing as other reviewers had experienced.

5916464,4,B00EIJTLK4,"It's Seinfeld and it's my favorite sitcom so I had to get this set. I thought about getting the older complete set as it's a much better boxset and the dvds are housed in their own CD type casing. However, I couldn't justify paying an additional $60+ over what I paid for mine. I only paid $60. With that said, if you do decide to buy this cheaper set, the first thing you should do is check all your dvds to make sure they're not scratched. Two of my dvds are scratched and one of them could have been way worse. The other looks like a small smudge. However, the other one had foreign particles inside the cardboard sleeve itself. I heard the scratching as I pulled it out. I blew into the sleeve and got small little wood chips hitting my face. I then used a air canister to blow the rest out. Other than that, all my other dvds were without a scratch. 5 stars for the series and 3 stars for the cheap boxset so 4 stars overall. It might be a cheap set but it's small, doesn't take up a lot of space and I like that. It's roughly the size of five dvds stacked on top of each other.",1404777600,2,1083,4.065420560747664

5916466,3,B00EIJTLK4,"First off I love the show, I would rate it 5 stars. The reason I rated this product as 3 stars is because of the awful packing for the DVDs. Upon receiving this collection I popped the first disc in and my player and it started having trouble playing after an episode. I have never ever seen my player struggle to read a disc. Looking at the rest of the discs they do have scratches and a couple even had a small amount of glue residue. One of the discs wouldn't even read in my player because of that. I understand they were trying to save on packaging costs but when new discs arrive to me scratched there is a problem. Luckily Amazon has a killer return system so they sent me another one and I was able to combine the two collections (yes the replacement one had the same issues as the first, just on different discs thanksfully) into one good one, hopefully they last.

Now aside from the horrendous packaging the collection is fantastic. It has all 9 seasons. Each disc has special features and there is even a bonus disc with interviews and other fun stuff that Seinfeld fans will appreciate. Kind of bummed there is no blu ray option at the moment but either way I am happy with my purchase. If you purchase from here double check all your discs before the end of the 30 day A-Z guarantee.",1404259200,9,1297,4.315573770491803
5916467,5,B00EIJTLK4,This body of work is the gold standard for a comedy series. A rare phenomena of chemistry between the main characters that lasted thru the entire series over the years.

5916469,5,B00EIJTLK4,"I got this for my husband, a super Seinfeld fan. After reading some of the negative reviews on packaging, I made sure to inspect it thoroughly when it arrived. I found no missing discs, and although we haven't had a chance to watch all the discs yet, none of them seemed scratched or difficult to get out of the sleeves. I personally love how it looks like a big book, with each ""page"" containing a disc. We've watched a few episodes, and one of the special feature documentaries; it was really interesting and of course funny. I think we'll be entertained for a long time with this collection!",1403568000,51,594,4.5092592592592595
5916470,5,B00EIJTLK4,"Don't listen to the complainers, they just want to complain.  This is an excellent way to own the entire series of this GREAT show.  The format is book style, with each page being a sleeve to hold each disc.  On each page is printed the episodes on that disc with synopsis of each.  The book itself slides into a sturdy slipcase to protect it when not in use.  All discs were accounted for,  NONE WERE MISSING.  It is possible to slide more than one disc into each sleeve, so perhaps the missing discs the one reviewer complained about, were put into the wrong sleeve or perhaps they bought the item USED in which case discs can go missing.  I can't think of a better format for all these discs.  This book format was used for the Star Wars series release, and it is being used in the special addition for the Eclipse series.  If you like this show and want to own the whole series this is the way to go: all cardboard, it's better for the environment, and the price versus buying them individually can't be beat, not to mention all the space you will save over buying them individually!",1403568000,4,1087,4.36318407960199
5916471,5,B00EIJTLK4,"I was twelve when this show had its last original run.  I became a fan six years later, because one of my school buddies would watch it in reruns on Fox.  In 2011 I had problems with OCD and agoraphobia, so after my meds started working, I hit the interstate for the movie theater, and buy a season set afterwards.  It was my reward for getting out of the house.  I've read the packing is bad for this set.  But I bought them at 40 bucks each new.  That's almost 350 dollars altogether, whereas this is 75 bucks.  Oh, well.  And I see that the coffee table set is now 129.  It was worth it, though.  I can't watch this anymore.  I know it by heart almost.  It's gone from watching it, to listening to it through the surround sound, to quoting lines and laughing.  My favorites would have to be The Race, the Butter Shave, the Junk Mail, and the one with the ""worlds-collide"" joke.  There are so many good ones!  ""Marriage, family, they're prisons!  Man-made prisons; you're doin' time!  It's like you have to ask permission to use the bathroom!""  This of course is a sad state of affairs, but a funny episode.  Oh, you have no idea!

I gave up after the second return and will be holding off on buying the complete series until they come out with better packaging. It's a shame too because I love the show and was looking forward to watching it from start to finish again.

I saw some other reviews, but didn't think it would be an issue after making it through the first 6 seasons without issues.

Re-watching Seinfeld has been great.  I have laughed out loud and now realize there will never be another great show like this. ""The Pen"" is one of my favorites due to ""Elaine's"" / Julia Louis Dreyfus's performance.  The melding and creation of these characters results in good clean humor, and comedy that exceeds any TV I have ever watched. (But I quit paying for TV long ago)

The boxed set includes commentaries about the making of the show, the production, Bloopers that are sometimes funnier than the episode, hearing from the writers, and listening to each of them and the actors discuss the show, and scenes that were deleted.  Wonderful insight to the making of Seinfeld.

I highly recommend this series.  Laughter is good for the soul and this series includes the height of comedy. Clean comedy.",1401408000,27,960,4.6390532544378695

For true fans of the show, yes, it's a great value. If it were lost, stolen or vaporized in a meltdown, I would buy it again.

Yes, it lost some of its steam in the later seasons, but I'll still take a less-than-amazing season of Seinfeld than the ""best"" season of almost any other show of similar kind. This boxed set is absolutely essential for any fan of the show as it fully collects every episode in chronological order (though not airing order), with all of the special features that were contained in the individual season sets. It's a shame there weren't some additional materials included for this all-inclusive set, but it's still a good amount of content. Being that the show was filmed in full frame ratio and in standard definition, it looks about as good as one could hope for when playing a DVD on an HD television set.

5916511,5,B00EIJTLK4,"First off the entire series on DVD gets a 5 star rating no matter what format it's in. SEINFELD is one of the all time greatest comedies that was ever produced, period. Now on to the one thing people seem to be complaining about, the packaging of the DVD's. I was concerned about what some reviewers said about the cardboard sleeve style that the DVD's slide in and out of. I immediately opened the plastic wrapping and I must say that while it is a stark difference from the original packaging of the first issues of the individual seasons I really cannot complain about the entire set up. I think the packaging that resembles a small fat hardcover book is not as bad as some might lead one to believe. This entire series set contains every disk from the original nine releases. All the extras included as well. As I began to watch each disk I noticed that sliding the disk out of the cardboard sleeve was not dificult at all and I detected no scratching whatsoever. In fact it was a delight to see the entire nine seasons together in a very neat package. One other thing that I am considering is that in the past many people complain about the high cost when a studio releases the entire series in an elaborate package, sometimes costing a few hundred dollars. While I know that some people love these extravagant set ups, most of us will not shell out the money for this. And most of the time the fancy packaging will not fit on a shelf in a person's collection, another complaint I hear from many. So when the studio comes out with a simpler container for an entire series I look at this has a cost saving measure so that every fan can have it. In the long run, all I really want is the great series that I love. If I want to, I can always move the disks to another type of packaging if I feel the disk will be harmed in any way, but the one that SEINFELD comes in is by far one of the best that I have seen. I very highly recommend getting this SEINFELD: The Complete Series set. If I had received this as a gift I would be jumping in the air with appreciation.

Others have complained of DVD damage. My AbFab discs are unscratched after several viewings.

Needless to say I purchased the set at an incredible deal.  I really like the packaging and don't have a single disc damaged with scratches or with any sticky residue like some reviewers have claimed.  The cardboard has a smooth finish on it, so I'm not sure how it will cause scratches.  (I've gotten scratches on my regular DVDs from the little plastic mound on the cases...)

5916576,4,B00EIJTLK4,"I almost wanted to give this boxed Seinfeld collection only 3 stars because the packaging is really sad. In retrospect, I have to give it 4 stars because the shows are so good (5 stars) and it's great to have them all organized together. Plus, there are plenty of extras, interviews and outtakes. If you love the show, this is really a nice collection. I wish for Bluray.

Okay, the packaging is not optimal. The DVDs are only in a cardboard sleeve which may cause some scratching if not careful. I did find a small dot of the ""gummy goo"" on one of the DVDs which I carefully removed before playing. This may be from the glue used to hold the flimsy cardboard together. This will definitely hinder the playing of the DVD and may even cause your player harm. If you find it excessive (or at all, if you wish) or on many DVDs, you should return for replacement.

FYI: CDs/DVDs have 2 protective coatings over the actual digital content. So, in most cases, scratches will not degrade or interfere with the performance. Even if there is a larger scratch, most players incorporate error correction which is constantly monitoring the digital content and, if there is a break/breach, the player will correct the flaw with virtually unnoticeable results.",1392508800,6,1246,4.684931506849315

Seinfeld's standup isn' t funny and neither is the show. At one time I believe it was voted the number one sitcom of all time?

5916594,5,B00EIJTLK4,"SEINFELD-THE COMPLETE SERIES: This New York based phenomenon was based on the observational humor of stand up comic JERRY SEINFELD, who spent his considerable down time obsessively dissecting the excruciating minutiae of every day life with his wacky, narcissistic friends. In addition to nit picky JERRY, the perfect ensemble included hilariously superficial ELAINE (JULIA-LOUISE DREYFUSS), schlubby loser GEORGE COSTANZA (the outstanding JASON ALEXANDER) and klutzy ED NORTON-like neighbor COSMO KRAMER (MICHAEL RICHARDS). Unlike most series, secondary characters were also memorable and fleshed out...mail carrying creep NEWMAN, self important  J. PETERMAN and GEORGE's loud, excitable father FRANK (JERRY STILLER) were as much fun as the main cast. Despite being billed as a ""show about nothing"", the convoluted plots dealt with soured relationships, quirky habits and bizarre coincidences, injecting catch phrases like ""Sponge worthy"", ""Yada Yada Yada"" and ""Master of my domain"" into the vernacular. Razor sharp writing headed by co-creator LARRY DAVID and the star's eye rolling attitude helped make SEINFELD the most wildly popular, innovative must-see sitcom fix of the nineties.

5916603,5,B00EIJTLK4,I was a Seinfeld fan during its original run in the 90s.  I have been wanting to share it with my teenaged sons to see if they enjoyed it as much as I did/do.  Finally and fortunately this set came out and I gave it to them for Christmas.  We've enjoyed us some Seinfeld every night since getting it.

5916604,1,B00EIJTLK4,"The show itself is an easy 5-star for me.  The packaging on the other hand is dismal which is how I rated it.  Other reviews have already covered the details of the horrible packaging (which I should have heeded) but I've waited a really long time for this series and it looks like the Blu-ray is nowhere in site.  BTW, another reviewer was kind enough to provide a YouTube video showing the packaging here: [...]

As stated by others, I have several DVDs that are not only scratched but some have many scratches on them.  I'm amazed they played without problems, however, there's no way they'll survive if constantly pulled in/out from the cardboard package.  The only way to minimize/stop the damage already done is to purchase ultra slim cases and put the discs in there.  My package also had a duplicate season 4 disc 2 where season 2 disc 1 is supposed to be.  So I'm missing season 2 disc 1.  I contacted Sony directly, as I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning the entire set, to get a replacement but haven't heard back.  I'll update this post once that happens.

I had also purchased the King of Queens which came in two spindles.  This is also a hassle but less damaging to the discs which I wish the Seinfeld set used in order to at least minimize the damage to the discs BEFORE the customer gets them.

So if you haven't gotten this series yet and you can be patient a bit (or a LOT) more, I'd wait for the Blu-ray.  I'm sure they're coming some day since TBS/TNT has shown or still is showing the HD versions.

2014-Jan-03 Update:
So trying to get a simple replacement from Sony turned out to be such a pain and inconvenience.  It took something like 6 or 7 emails before the different support people could figure out what was needed even though I provided all the info they asked for.  Then, they asked me to send the DVD back before they'll send a replacement which would have taken 3-5 weeks.  Yes, weeks.  Since I'm within the return window, I just used the Amazon return process which I should have just done in the first place.  So if you run into an issue and you have to get a replacement, just use Amazon.",1388361600,396,2140,4.383248730964467

I didn't get to watch Seinfeld when it was on in the 90's I was too busy raising my 3 kids, but enjoy the show watching re-runs and now I can watch it any time!
Suggestions for the next set: I wish they had a better way to separate the dvds as it is the cardboard separators is kind of a pain, and I have to touch the dvd, and I don't like to do that. Another suggestion is I thought they could have put a booklet, explaining each dvd in the set.

5916618,5,B00EIJTLK4,"BUT SO WHAT?

This is the top television show to ever come on. People need to enjoy it for what it's worth. DVD still has relevancy at the moment. Not top relevancy, but still significant. They just wanted to put out the series again in a smaller package, that could cost less. Sony Entertainment tends to do that lately with a lot of the TV shows they own after they already put everything out on the shelf. I saw the review on YouTube about the packaging, and I'm positive that if you treat it with care as you pull the discs out, they'll be fine.

Perhaps the main reason that it isn't on Blu-ray yet is that its time hasn't come. Certainly, it was shot to an HD-ready quality, but there's more to it. It takes a lot of work to make a Blu-ray disc for something that old. It took Seinfeld 7 years after the DVD invention to release the sets on that format. It takes years for them to put everything on discs, then there's the thing with special features. You need to figure out whether to transfer the old features from the DVDs or make new special features, especially when so much time has passed.

This specific release isn't for everyone, but there are two things you can do, depending on the kind of person that fits you best: If you want Seinfeld to keep up with the times and let you watch it in the most enhanced quality, wait for the Blu-ray and in the meantime, catch the HD reruns on TBS at a specific time. If you want to watch any episode whenever and you can't find it streaming on Netflix or Amazon Prime, go with this package. Seinfeld is the kind of show that wants to be viewed for the great material that they gave you over the years, and this is the best we got right now.",1385510400,7,1695,4.2253086419753085
