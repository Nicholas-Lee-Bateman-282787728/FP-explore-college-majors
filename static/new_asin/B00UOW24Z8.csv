8707803,1,B00UOW24Z8,"This volume is PATHETIC. Typical hollywood inaccurate pseudo-history junk. In the Korean section nothing but F9F's MiG 15's and F86's With a few seconds on the F80. No mention of F94B Starfire, F2H Banshee or F3D Skyknights (the leader in night fighter kills). And my favorite part was the F84F's Thunderstreaks painted gray with red stars on 'em playing MiG 15's.(yee gods!)  In the Air defense section 10 seconds on the F102 Dagger (2,500 built) . 60 seconds on the F86D. Nothing on the F89 Scorpion, the F101 Voodoo or the F94 Starfire. 30 seconds on the F106 Dart and then a 45 minute rant on about F4's, F15, F18's F16's which were assigned to ADC at the very end of the cold war and contributed next to nothing. But if you can't tell the difference between a MiG 15 and an F84F and a greyhound bus this video is for you!",1493251200,,826,4.434210526315789
