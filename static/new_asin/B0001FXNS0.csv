2000004,4,B0001FXNS0,"LUST FOR GOLD (1949) is very interesting western.

Ostensibly the true story of the fabled Lost Dutchman Gold Mine in Arizona's Superstition Mountains, the movie casts Glenn Ford as Jacob ""Dutch"" Walz, perhaps the most villainous role of his career.

Walz, according to this story, murdered several men, including his partner (Edgar Buchanan) in order to keep the location of his mine secret.  However, when he meets Julia Thomas (Ida Lupino), he falls hard and is about to share his wealth with her until he learns that she and her husband (Gig Young), plan to steal the fortune from him.  Walz' love quickly turns to thoughts of a brutal revenge.

Directed by S. Sylvan Simon, LUST FOR GOLD is actually two stories.  There is the historical one, plus a modern tale in which Walz' grandson (William Prince) seeks the mine, only to be stalked by a mysterious killer.

This first-rate western is a mix of film noir and thriller.

2000005,5,B0001FXNS0,"Columbia Pictures DVD, excellent print and audio.  A fun western mystery that holds your attention and keeps you guessing whodunit right up to the end.  You may even be tempted to pack your duds and go in search of the legendary ""Lost Dutchman"" gold mine.  Myself, I may do a little online research for fun on some rainy afternoon.

2000007,4,B0001FXNS0,"A rather grim but extremely satisfying Western directed by S. Sylvan Simon, features Glenn Ford as Jacob ""Dutch"" Walz, a German who discovers ""the richest goldmine in the world"" in 19th century Arizona. Although not as well-known as other Columbia Westerns, it holds up very well, and is much more appreciated now than it was when it was released in 1949. Juliet Thomas (Ida Lupino) is the cold-hearted woman who pretends to admire Walz as a man, when in fact she just wants to know where his mine is located. She goes so far as to put him up in her home after he collapses in a drunken stupor on the porch of her bakery, and later lets him court her. She pretends to be German (even briefly speaking to him in his native tongue), and feigns ignorance and disinterest in his newfound status as a wealthy citizen. Her pursuit of Jacob only infuriates her estranged husband, Pete Thomas (Gig Young), who wants to be back on her good side (as well as her bed), and so they quietly conspire together to learn the location of his mine and rob Jacob of his fortune. But he is soon onto them and it ends on an interesting showdown on Superstition Mountain.

Despite its serious tone, the film has some light-hearted moments, never more wonderfully presented as Juliet shows Jacob her family album and he comes across a photograph of her as an ""au natural"" baby, or the moment after Jacob hands off the cookies he bought from Juliet's shop to a young boy, who collapses under the weight of two massive baskets full! And Lupino shows her independent mind and capabilities in this unsympathetic role, while Gig Young's scoundrel manages to gain a little sympathy as the ignored husband. But Ford, who rarely played villainous roles, really brings uncompromising realism as a greedy, self-serving, ill-tempered man (the scene involving the little girl and him allowing her to ""play"" with his shotgun is a classic example of this). His attempt at a German accent falters in some sequences, but this does not deter from his performance.

This aspect of the movie is actually shown in flashback, the opening being of Jacob's grandson Barry Storm (William Prince) trying to find the mine and solve the mystery of the many puzzling, tragic deaths of those who have attempted to discover it. Fans of the Lone Ranger television series will enjoy the early, uncredited appearance of Jay Silverheels as a deputy.

Now I know why greed is among the seven most deadly sins!

The DVD features a few theatrical trailers.",1165104000,14,2496,4.731034482758621
2000008,5,B0001FXNS0,"In a way LUST FOR GOLD is a ""mystery"" Western that doesn't lose its real interest after you understand (sort of) the mystery and understand the story. And that says a lot about its lasting attraction and why I am delighted to see it on DVD. The stark but beautiful B&W print lends atmosphere to the ""search"" for lost treasure, and even the name of the mountain range where the Spanish gold was mysteriously buried, Superstition Mountain, adds to the ambience. This is a truly entertaining oater that will entertain the entire family or friends. Recommended highly.",1113523200,26,564,4.824742268041237

2000048,4,B0001FXNS0,"I grew up in Arizona, in sight of the Superstition Mountains. I remember seeing this movie on television sometime in the mid-1960s, and until now had never seen it again. But I never did forget it, nor its compellingly-told story. It may have partly been this movie that motivated my brother and me to undertake our own search for the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. We tramped around the canyons and cliff faces near Weaver's Needle for days at a time. But other than some really spectacular scenery, we of course never did find it. (I'm still a believer in its existence!)

But as for the movie itself, Lust for Gold is a first-rate Western drama set both in the present and in the Old West. The use of flashback in this film is superb (and I am not usually a fan of the technique). The scenery is dramatic, the characters believable, the double plot (past and present) perfectly integrated, and the climactic fight on the cliff's edge truly terrifying.

Perfect ending, too.",1382745600,,972,4.645348837209302
2000059,5,B0001FXNS0,I saw this film when I was 10 years old and never forgot how it thrilled my imagination. Is the gold really there? Who knows? Maybe it will be found some day. Interesting location filming in the beginning and end of the film. The transfer and sound were good considering the B/W original.,1379548800,,288,4.452830188679245
2000060,3,B0001FXNS0,"Philosophers and social thinkers from Plato to Marx had commented in their various treatises on the hol d that gold has held for a significant portion of humankind. Whether to wear it, carry it, or to miserly hoard it that quest for the yellow fever stuff had animated more than one human saga. And it does so here in a saga of the Old West, the old American West, Lust for Gold, a title that says it all, and that saw more than one feverish dream go up in smoke or vanish under an off-hand bullet. The road west was paved with the litter of the whitened bones of many such dreams.
This little black and white B-film is done in a flash- back as a grandson of the  man who the story centers on, Jacob Walz, is knee-deep in his exploration of the quest for the yellow stuff, stuff that his grandfather  allegedly found in the hills of  the West, the Arizona west.  The idea behind the film was to show that, once again, men, and women, can get their thinking skewed by the desire get rich quick with a little strike, a little yellow stuff.

Now this Jacob Walz (played by Glenn Ford) is not your typical Western cowboy of film lore, some waspy John Wayne, but a tinhorn, although a tinhorn quick on the trigger and quick with the back of his hand German, from back East who came west, like a million others, to find his place in the sun. His place in the sun was to strike it rich in the gold fields, not by digging and sweating himself but by finding a version of El Dorado, finding the lost mine gold fields which some earlier Spanish adventurers  had mined, and lost, after being massacred by the Comanches who took exception the desecration of their burial ground where the gold was found . And he does find the end of the rainbow after getting rid of  (killing off) his partner and a couple of wreak-less sons of the Spanish conquistidores who got the madness which started way back when looking for oro that drove their forebears across that dangerous Atlantic in search of treasure.

Of course those finds were only the start of Jacob Walz's problems, his everyday problems as everybody in the greater Arizona area began to take dead aim at him to find out where his stake was and take their own shots at it. And of course this being a film, a romance of the Old West film, a dame (played by Ida Lupino), a married dame, enters into the plot to bring Brother Walz down. Ida was tired, tired unto death of her nickel and dime existence out in the arid West and tired unto death of her ne'er-do-well husband so she used her vast feminine wiles to snag Glenn in order to get that gold dream of hers into shape . In the end though Ida's perfidy, extreme perfidy, Glenn's mania, and the natural elements combined to close out our saga on a down note. The found lost goldmine was lost once again for that itchy grandson (and others) to pick up the trail. Yeah, the stuff of dreams, yet again.",1375747200,,2891,4.33086876155268

8012440,4,B0001FXNS0,"The 1949 movie Lust for Gold is best described as a story of adventure, suspense and mystery, based on The Lost Dutchman's Mine.
Many have ventured to tell their version of the Legend of Superstition Mountain and all the tales of discovering gold. And there is more...
the 1956 movie Secret of Treasure Mountain is about gold exploration. This production used footage from Lust for Gold,
in identifying the historical background of The Lost Dutchman's Mine. The actor William Prince, who played the character of the Dutchman's grandson in Lust for Gold, is also featured in Secret of Treasure Mountain, as an explorer.

Wikipedia provides detailed information on The Lost Dutchman's Mine that took place in Superstition Mountain, located near Phoenix,
Arizona. This Mine was worked by the Peralta family in the 1800's but they were attacked by Apache Indians, who claimed an intrusion
on sacred land. It is said that the exploration of gold and treasures found in Superstition Mountain date back as early as the 1600's
by Mexico and Spain. The Dutchman found the Mine worked by the Peralta's and according to what is believed, the location of the
Peralta Mine and the Lost Dutchman's Mine were considered one in the same. The truth of the Lost Dutchman's Mine is questionable,
since the claim to this Mine was never filed with the State of Arizona.

The History Channel recently presented a documentary on Superstition Mountain. I found this program not as informative as expected.
I would like to see the History Channel improve this documentary at some future time.",1433808000,,1567,5.0
