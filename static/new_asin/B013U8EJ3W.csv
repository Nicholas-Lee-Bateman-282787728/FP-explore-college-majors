8728827,2,B013U8EJ3W,Love Clara Bow but the picture quality on these two films is pretty ordinary,1517356800,,76,4.5
8728828,2,B013U8EJ3W,"Again, Alpha's transfers disappoint.  ""Down to the Sea in Ships"" is much better in the Kino edition.  ""The Primrose Path,"" however, is only available here.  A terrible source print - washed out, indifferently transferred and inappropriately scored.  Some footage may be missing.  Very, very hard to watch.  But at the moment it's the only version available.  Why does Alpha have such a tantalizing catalog, but present so poorly?",1480118400,4,429,5.220588235294118
8728829,4,B013U8EJ3W,"Good movies with engaging stories. I would have given it 5 stars if the print were in better condition. There were a few jumps here and there and this print could definitely use some restoring. Even though it was not in the best condition I am glad that this movie was put out because I always enjoy seeing Clara Bow sparkle on the screen. The ""It Girl"" indeed.",1471910400,,361,4.323529411764706
