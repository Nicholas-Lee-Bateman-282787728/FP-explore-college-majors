8289890,2,B001CUBA6K,"I ordered this DVD hoping that it would educate a friend of mine who is an aspiring mortician. When we sat down to watch it, it turned out to be less about the science and more about the arrangement of funerals. Overall, the feature is boring and lacks any depth as far as undertaking goes. Not a whole lot to learn from this, you're better off browsing youtube for mortuary science.",1356739200,,383,4.408450704225352
8289891,4,B001CUBA6K,Perhaps not for the faint of heart. Pretty graphic in a few places it takes the viewer behind the closed doors of prep rooms,1354492800,,124,4.208333333333333
8289892,2,B001CUBA6K,"I bought this DVD to give to my nephew who is going to mortician school. Very disappointing. Hardly anything explaining the ""embalming"" practice more on picking out a casket. I think the movie could have went into more detail but No. I gave it a 2 star only because 1 star says I hate it, of which I don't but I was very dissapointed, I wouldn't bother to watch it on TV for free.",1354320000,,380,4.148648648648648
8289893,5,B001CUBA6K,"This is a very interesting film. I bought it when I was in mortuary school, right before I started my job as a mortician's apprentice. It really helped give me an idea of what my job would be like. It is graphic and definitely not for the faint of heart. I recommend to anyone in the mortuary profession or anyone that just has that degree of curiosity about what it is we do behind the scenes.",1317600000,5,394,4.197368421052632
