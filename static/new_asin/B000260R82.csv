2063310,3,B000260R82,"If it were not for the Triumphal Scene, this production could be forgotten.  It was poorly filmed.  You were distracted when scenes changed by flimsy material blowing in front of the cameras.  The processional was truly fantastic, well orchestrated, and grand opera at its ultimate.  Who said you need animals for this scene?

All in all, the music is always grand, the set was very good, but the direction and filming leave a lot to be desired.  I am surprised the La Scala audience was not letting their usual vocal reactions be heard!  Perhaps it was edited!",1207526400,5,561,4.721649484536083
2063311,5,B000260R82,Alagna is superb . The rest of the cast stands tall with him in this magnificent production.  The final scene leaves the audience fully satisfied and pleased that they have experienced something very special!,1206662400,5,208,5.117647058823529
2063312,4,B000260R82,"This was a brave attempt by Franco Zeffirelli and LaScala to mount a new traditional production of Verdi's AIDA to rival the classic Emmy-and-Peabody-award-winning setting still on view by the Metropolitan Opera.  Violeta Urmana is a vocally gorgeous, well-acted Aida, and she uses her voice to stunning effect.  Roberto Alagna was seriously maligned by the LaScala ""claque"" - he sings a fine Radames - a little rough in the Celeste Aida, due to the timing or how new it is in his repertoire, but the rest of the opera is a revelation!  His Radames is handsome, earnest, forthright, and believable (and in great physical shape  - he even goes shirtless in the Act 1 Scene 2 prayer scene!).  Contrary to the Spanish reviewer, I thought he and Urmana had good chemistry together, but they were in a new production which was very busy, with lots of little steps and other stuff to physically negotiate. The tomb scene in particular displayed tenderness and palpable regret.  The mezzo was quite excellent, reminiscent of Giulietta Simionato in her heyday, or Dolora Zajick, still on view in the aforementioned Met production.

Three problems:  the editing, which veers from close-ups, to medium shots, with many dreamy, annoying visuals of floating, wafting fabric, to what effect I know not.  It got very tiresome after the first three or four dissolves.  Ultimately, it was unnecessary and just dumb.  The edits needed to be clear and concise, or at least somewhat coherent. The conducting by Riccardo Chailly was perfunctory; he seemed to be attempting a Muti-like visual suggestion, with the hair and the gestures, etc., but the sounds were of someone conducting from a score he had just read.  It sounded clumsy and lacked grace and subtlety.  The costume, fright wig, and makeup for Amonasro looked like a refugee from a 70's era Carol Burnett tv sketch.

Despite these criticisms, I would recommend this performance, because the singers - and Verdi's timeless work - survived with their integrity intact, and put forth an emotional, vivid story of love and regret, which made the items that didn't work small in comparison.  I just think these videos need to be reviewed before they come out for sale, because sometimes (not with this one) the releases are not worth the discs they are printed on, especially at the increasingly exorbitant prices for which they sell.",1204675200,8,2371,4.982233502538071
2063313,3,B000260R82,"If you're going to buy this AIDA because this is the production Roberto Alagna walked out on, you're going to be confused.  The only thing I can figure is they taped a couple of the performances, including a dress rehearsal and then spliced all the good parts together to make the DVD.  Alagna's singing of ""Celeste Aida"" is awful but you don't hear any booing from the audience unless it was edited out.  He excels in the last two acts and the audience lets him know it.  There is very little love shown between him and Aida.  Alagna seems to be concentrating on the music and seldom takes his eyes off the conductor.  Generally the singing is quite good from all the principals but Aida is plump and Amneris is svelte and regal.  It's kind of hard to believe Radames chooses Aida.  The sets and costumes by Franco Zefirelli are spectacular but ruined by TV director Patrizia Carmine who tries to turn this into a music video using lots of superimposed images, blurry fade outs and bellowing sheets in various colors blocking too many key scenes.  The consumer should be warned this is a cinematic version of this opera which doesn't succeed. Verdi's music doesn't need any help.  Holding all the pieces together is Riccardo Chailly the conductor whom the audience clearly worships.  Franco Ziffrelli comes out at the end and it was sad to see he had to be helped walking on the stage.  Say what you will about his grand productions, they are never boring.  I already have four AIDA'S on DVD and welcome this latest effort.",1203897600,15,1524,4.620817843866171
2063314,1,B000260R82,"This is Zeffirelli at his very worst. An incredibly tasteless and vulgar production, with more cheap gold than anyone could bear in a casino show and without a single original idea about the staging of this wonderful but overexposed opera. The level of incompetence is hard to beleive and La Scala has reached a new low in its undistinguished recent history. The Orchestra sounds very good, but Alagna is uncomfortable as Radames, with a voice inadequate for the role, although he does try. Urmana is somewhat better, but it isn't enough. To make things worse the video producer thinks he can improve this sad event with silly camera movements and very distressing close-ups of the fabrics of every costume! Do yourself a favour and totally ignore this release.",1203379200,20,761,4.953125
2063315,5,B000260R82,"La Scala, Milan pulled out all the stops in their staging of Verdi's opera, which had not been performed since 1987. Zeffirelli's staging is highly effective and one could not have expected anything less than excellent from this seasoned director. The principals are a mixed bag, depending on how you like your singers - Alagna's lyric voice has grown and he has no problems sustaining the role's demands once he gets past 'Celeste Aida' and Violeta Urmana has a big voice and can shade it down to a fine whisper when required, although I personally feel she is not completely within the role's demands vocally. The supporting cast is excellent and Riccardo Chailly conducts a fine account of Verdi's score.",1201132800,16,707,4.9
2063316,4,B000260R82,"The production is beautiful and the musical performances are, for the most part, very good.  The soprano is a bit relentless in her sadness (visually, body language, etc.) but she sings very well.  Altogether I would say this is a good choice for anyone wanting a traditional approach to this essential opera.

2063317,4,B000260R82,"The first time I saw Aida, it was all spectacle. By the third viewing, it had become an intimate tale, so familiar to us all: a tragic love triangle (and an interracial one at that). On fourth viewing, I fell in love with all of it - the spectacle of court and war, the dances, Verdi's use of the orchestra, the heartbreakingly beautiful pieces he wrote for Aida, the stunning (as in, ""it stuns me"") ending. It amazes me how Verdi can move seamlessly from spectacle (e.g. the triumphal march) to the most intimate of songs (""Numi, pieta,"" ""O patria mia""). And, uncharacteristically, Verdi gets downright sensuous in Act II, Scene 1 where Amneris is dressed and pampered by her ladies and her slaves. The final scene is nothing short of brilliant: Verdi ends this bigger-than-life opera not with the brass of the orchestra blasting away but with the most intimate of scenes, accompanied by strings alone. Yes, the lovers die, but it's Verdi's brilliant overlay of their death duet with Amneris' prayer for peace - she, who must live with what she's done - that has me crying every time.

There are a wealth of Aida DVD's to choose from. What sets this production apart is the staging. The Gran Teatre del Liceu of Barcelona used trompe-d'oeil sets that were painted on paper by Josep Mestres Cabanes for a production of Aida in 1945. When the opera closed, the paper sets were removed from their wooden frames and stored away. Almost 60 years later, set designer Jordi Castellis had them restored for this production. There are over 100 planes of paper and they are absolutely stunning - lush and colorful, rich in detail. This production is worth seeing just for the sets; it's like being at a Catalonian art exhibit.

The performances, however, are uneven and that's why four stars, not five. Daniela Dessi is a favorite soprano of mine. Even though she can be shrill in the upper register, I forgive this because she always moves me. She projects a fascinating combination of strength and vulnerability. She humanizes every role, making us feel as if the character is someone we might know and care about in real life. She gives a heartrending performance of ""Numi, pieta."" Her pianissimo is stunning.

Dessi's real life husband, Fabio Armiliato, doesn't excel as Radames although he improves in the later part of the opera. He tends to just blurt out his songs with little interpretation or nuance. He and Dessi do have great onstage chemistry though!

I was also disappointed in Elisabetta Fiorillo as Amneris although other reviewers here thought she was excellent. Her voice is indeed powerful, but she sings as if it's a solo performance. Even in the ensemble pieces, she continually faces the audience, raising her arms straight out to her sides, creating this massive rectangle with her robe. The effect is that she appears to be on the stage by herself instead of part of an ensemble. For me, it ruins the great Act IV, Scene 1 duet with Radames. (By contrast, Dolora Zajick in The Met production from 1989 not only sings Amneris powerfully and beautifully, but the intensity of her interactions in the scenes with Radames and Aida make my spine tingle.)

The DVD includes a documentary on Josep Mestres Cabanes' sets and how they were restored. I highly recommend this production.",1160784000,15,3291,4.807420494699647
2063318,5,B000260R82,"Amazon.com already includes ten complete DVD versions of Aida. My favorite is the one from the Metropolitan Opera (New York) with Aprile Millo and Placido Domingo. This latest arrival comes from Barcelona (two discs; 186 minutes; recorded live in the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, 21-24 July, 2003). In addition to the many virtues found by the previous reviewer (J. Scott Morrison, July 13, 2004), I would summarize my overall impression as: this is a magnificent performance! It has been recorded with superb sound. The orchestra, the chorus, the rhythm adopted by the conductor and, particularly, the restored trompe-l'oeil sets from the Catalonian painter, Josep Mestres Cabanes, make you forgive and forget the limitations of this new version of Aida. In some of the scenes (particularly in the last two acts), you are able to achieve such a level of immersion in the work that you forget some of the limitations of the two principal singers (Daniela Dessi and Fabio Armilato). Elisabetta Fiorillo (Amneris) and Juan Pons (Amonasro) provide an intensity rarely seen. The DVD includes also a short documentary (10:26 minutes) about the Liceu of Barcelona (before and after its reconstruction following the fire of 1994) as well as on Josep Mestres Cabanes, the real idol of this production.",1091059200,40,1298,5.185714285714286
2063319,5,B000260R82,"It's been years since I've seen 'Ada,' but my first production goes back over fifty years and I've seen it too many times to count. My first Ada was Zinka Milanov; that tells you how long ago it was. And in the movie theater I fell in love with my first sight of Sophia Loren in the Italian filmed version made in the 1950s. She lip-synched to the singing of Renata Tebaldi. I came to this DVD not expecting a lot, but I was, frankly, overwhelmed. I suppose part of that is because it had been so long since I'd seen the opera; it IS one of the great dramas of the opera stage, and like 'Boh&egrave;me' and 'Carmen' (the other two of the ABC triumvirate) it never fails to move an audience (and me).

I've always sniffed at opera-goers who tell about their opera-going experiences by talking about the scenery. C'mon, opera is about the music, right? Well, yes, right. But this production from Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, one of the world's great opera houses, is a spectacular one, and what's more, it's a revival of a mise-en-sc&egrave;ne that goes back to 1945. Here's the story: For many years the head scenery designer of the Liceu was Joseph Mestres Cabanes, the last of the so-called 'Catalan school' of set design. What he and his predecessors had perfected was the art of painting scenes on paper, that's right PAPER, using incredible skill at trompe l'oeil and perspective to make the scenery look, from the auditorium, ultra-realistic. Mestres Cabanes went a step further--his richly detailed sets were painstakingly painted, yes, but they also included fantastic, even surrealistic details that repaid close attention by the audience, and his use of color was uniquely gorgeous. His 1945 production of 'Ada,' his last for the house, was probably the pinnacle of his achievement (along with an almost equally spectacular 'Meistersinger' of the year before). The production played for a number of years, but the paper sets (which onstage were mounted on elaborate wooden frames) had long since been removed from their frames, folded, and put away. Miraculously, when the Liceu burnt to the ground in 1995, they survived. Set designer Jordi Castellis had the idea of repairing the wear-and-tear flaws in the 60 year old sets and remounting Mentres Cabanes's production. This was done in July 2003 to huge acclaim, and rightly so. The sets for the four acts,  using as many as 120 different planes and layers of paper, are, in a word, astonishingly beautiful and effective. But, enough about scenery ... what about the musical and dramatic values here?

This is a conservative production in that there is none of that Eurotrash rewriting of the plot, the setting, the era, or the psychological gist of the piece. The Liceu orchestra and chorus are excellent; I particularly liked the rich voices of the Priests in their scenes. The ballet is expert, although I did wonder why the so-called 'Sacred Dance of the Priestesses' in Act I, Scene 2 was danced by male dancers, however effective it was. Ah, the singers. Verdi is hard to cast these days; we all long for the days of 'real' Verdi baritones, real spinto sopranos, real ringing-voiced tenors. The Liceu measures up pretty well in this regard. It had been years since I'd heard Juan Pons sing, but his trombone-voiced Amonasro is one of the best I've ever heard. Robert Scandiuzzi's Ramfis is a suitably sonorous black basso. The Priestess (my first, would you believe, was Lucine Amara when she was VERY young and long before she graduated to leading roles) is nicely done by Ana Nebot. Radam&egrave;s is sung by a tenor only vaguely known to me, Fabio Armiliato, a fairly young man who is now singing in all the biggest houses. His tenor is just one notch below that of the best, but he manages it well, his acting is excellent and his appearance (he's tall and trim, and has devilish good looks) helps the effect. This is a video of a live performance and he, like many tenors, isn't at his peak for his big aria at the very beginning, 'Celeste Ada,' but he warms up nicely and by the time of the Nile scene and the Dungeon scene the voice is ringing out heroically; he is also capable of nuanced soft singing. Daniela Dess&igrave; is a known quantity. She has been a leading Verdi soprano for years, and she shines here. Again, like Armiliato, she warms up after Act I and by Act II and beyond the singing is thrilling. Both the duet with Amonasro in the Nile scene and the aria and duet in Act IV are scrumptious, delicately shaded and featuring some pianissimi that gave me goose-bumps.

But the big surprise to me, since I'd never heard of her, is the Amneris of Elisabetta Fiorillo. Wow! In Act I there is evidence of a huge voice, but also some control problems. But by Act II and beyond she is simply magnificent. This is a dramatic voice with heft, flexibility, control. By Act IV she is simply stunning, and the audience certainly agrees with me on that. After her scena in Act IV, Scene 1, the audience went nuts.

In summary, then, this is the record of a wonderful performance enhanced by the restoration of 60-year-old sets that are themselves real works of art. This may not be Nilsson, Tebaldi, Price, Domingo, Bergonzi, whoever, but it is still thrilling theater.

There are subtitles in English, French, German and Catalan. There are an illustrated synopsis on DVD 1 (of 2) and a short documentary on Mestres Cabanes's sets and their restoration. There is no libretto, but the subtitles (in English, at least) are accurate and well-synchronized.

Recommended.

2063320,3,B000260R82,"If one is old enough, I am sure he or she would remember the first time the 'stereo' format in audio was introduced. They made it a point to separate the sound to such a degree that you got a silent hole in the middle of the room between the speakers.

Similarly, the post production (video direction) people here thought that it is quite worthwhile to demonstrate the clarity of the blu ray format and blank out the opera at times, and distract you into watching the details on the walls, skirts, flags and the polish of the trumpets and so on. It served the purpose of sprinkling water on one's face just when one is about to doze off to a nice dream...

As far as the opera goes
Alagna is not impressive. He has to FORCE himself to sing loud and his voice becomes ear piercing and harsh rather than have a beautiful rounded tone when just about any other great singer of this opera, from Domingo upwards who tried the same. It becomes quite irritating and the vibratos kind of make the intonation either sharp or flat. He is just inadequate for this role.

Urmana was just about adequate. Although she does not really become the star of the show, she has done far more justice to Aida than Alagna has to Radamez. Komlozi (Amneris) has sung her role quite well. The rest of the cast are quite alright, and do their parts quite well.

Kudos to Riccardo Chaily. He really impresses along with the orchestra. The sound is just great, and the audio balancing and post production has been done rather impressively. He and the orchestra/chorus is the reason that I have given 3 stars for this production rather than 2.

Zafirelli? I think he is getting a little old and his sense of what is grandiose is getting a little grander and therefore, rather gaudy. Remember what they did with the eastman color or technicolour in the movie 'South Pacific'? He kind of achieves this with this production.

Would I have bought it if I had seen it before doing so? In all likelihood, NO.

HOWEVER,one gets used to a bad smell too provided most of the other stuff is more or less OK. So what is immediately distracting pales a bit, and the overall beauty of the production with Chailly in command redeems it to an extent.",1303430400,4,2206,4.459057071960298

New edition:
Excellent presentation! But, annoying the poor performance of TV producer. Vasiliev .. I live in Russia and this is the style I've seen 30 years ago in our theaters. I do not like. But the work of the costume-designer above all praise! What attention to detail! Representation is static and horizontal sticks, like a deep artistic image I still do not like.

2063324,3,B000260R82,"This is a decent Aida. Alagna sings Radames better than I thought he would. I thought his voice would be too light for the role. Urmana is also better than I expected, because previously I thought she was squally when I saw her sing the La Forza Leonora and the HD Aida from the Met recently. So she was in much better form than I have seen her in.

I normally like Zeffirelli's set designs, but what is this obsession with golden rods strung horizontally throughout this production? What are they supposed to signify?

I agree with other reviewers about this video though. The video/tv director spends way too much time focusing on pieces of fabric and details of the sets while the singers are singing. It starts out being a very small annoyance, but by the Tomb Scene you are so sick of seeing a piece of fabric while the singers are singing and then it suddenly gets ten times worse during this Tomb Scene. It is like the video director did not want you to even see the Tomb Scene at all. It is incredibly annoying! Whoever made the decision to continually cut to fabric and inanimate objects throughout the video is an idiot. The Tomb Scene is one of the most beautiful moments in all of opera and it was spoiled.",1258848000,11,1218,4.433035714285714

2063326,5,B000260R82,"Aida has been a favourite of mine for over 50 years but had not been looked at for awhile.  So it was a great pleasure to reacquaint myself with the music.  This production, filmed by Zeffirelli, is a sumptuous one although the frequent dissolves into out of focus waving cloth could be distracting at times and was a bit over done for me.
But the singing is brilliant, particularly Ildiko Komlosi in the role of Amneris.  For some reason I have previously always regarded the role of Aida as the pivotal one but this production clearly demonstrates the importance of Amneris with her intense passion for our hero Radames, sung by Roberto Alagna.  This is not meant to depreciate the great singing of Violeta Urmanda in the title role.  The chorus is great although a more powerful Ramfis than Giorgio Giuseppini would have not gone astray.
The sets, costumes and lighting are top notch in this traditional presentation although the ballet scenes were somewhat wimpy.
The lack of audience applause at times was puzzling as Italian audiences are unrestrainedly enthusiastic, so it is hard to imagine Zeffirelli was able to persuade them to keep silent. So, it is possible some of it was filmed without an audience although no change in acoustics was obvious.
Yes, the sound is glorious and the video quality impeccable.  This would be a good first opera for someone to cut their teeth on.  Highly recommended.
POSTCRIPT:  Just read some of the other reviews (I always write mine before looking) and can appreciate others found Zeffirelli's approach distracting, but to me the singing was good enough to forgive that.  Yes, it was hard to appreciate Aida, as portrayed by Violetta, as being someone to risk life and reputation for, but her brilliant singing made me overlook this.  And I agree Alagna was unimpressive in the first Act but redeemed himself at the end. Yes, the final production does come through as a ""stitched up"" effort combining some live production with some that is not.  So yes, a mixed bag, but a worthwhile one IMHO.",1247529600,9,2038,4.827586206896552
2063327,3,B000260R82,"I was looking for a modern replacement of my old Met Opera DVD of Aida and, as someone who likes the spectacle of Grand Opera, decided to buy this Franco Zeffirelli directed version from La Scala. I noted that a number of the reviewers had mentioned the superimposed images and fade-ins and fade-outs employed by the director and how much it had annoyed them. However, I thought they were probably being too subjective and I couldn't imagine that a video director would have been given so much of a free hand that it could detract from Zeffirelli's production. How wrong I was! In the triumphal march in Act 2 the stage is full of people, the costumes are opulent, the props are magnificent, the orchestra under Chailly is building up to a climax and yet Patrizia Carmine thinks that she can improve on all of this by adding dissolves through drapes and superimposing close-ups of trumpets; not just once, but again and again.
There is so much to like about this production and I no doubt will watch it occasionally, but it could have been so much better without the interference of the video director. I would go so far as to suggest that all might not be lost and the DVD could possibly be re-released without all the offensive and unnecessary additions.

2063329,5,B000260R82,"This Zeffirelli production is grand in every respect - sets and scenery, decor, costumes, jewelry, ballet - only the best was used for this Verdi masterpiece. A true feast for the eyes. I certainly couldn't find any fault with these luxurious and elaborate sets. I thought the principal singers were very satisfying vocally. OK, so Alagna's Celeste Aida wasn't the best I ever heard but this is one heck of an aria to sing at the start of act 1 without much of a warm up and there aren't too many tenors around who can pull this off flawlessly. Komlosi's Amneris was wonderful in every respect - vocally, visually, with some fine acting talents. While I loved Urmana's voice, I wasn't enthralled with her visually - with her billowing gowns she gave a rather matronly impression of Aida which does not fit my romantic image of the slave over which Radames loses his head. This may be a very superficial opinion on my part but with the present day technology  with all the close-ups, I prefer to be carried away emotionally by singers who make a their roles believable. The ballet scenes were also very well executed - Roberto Bolle, the principal dancer, certainly created a lot of excitement among the audience (and obviously enjoyed the adulations showered upon him).
The negative aspect of this Aida for me was the artsy camera work which I found very irritating and distracting. Every few minutes there were interruptions by superimposed images, filters, and zooming in on parts of the stage (like a wall treatment, statue, or weapon) instead of staying with the action. This was irritating and disruptive to the flow of the opera.
The reason I purchased this recording is that I have loved every Zeffirelli production I have ever seen and this one is no exception.",1236297600,9,1769,4.781045751633987

unappealing,what are they doing,these poor decca engineers.

2063335,2,B000260R82,"This was supposed to be a magnificent return of Aida to La Scala. It is very disappointing. The singers and their signing and acting are OK, but far away of being magnificent. The sound of the Disc is certainly not portraying the incredible amount of people on the stage, in Act II in particular. Bluray technology allows for a much fuller sound. The worst of all is the video production and camera movements. The close-ups in the middle of the arias and the ballet make no sense at all and are really disturbing.
The only reason to buy this Disc is to see the glitzy production in full Bluray detail. Verdi deserves better!",1227830400,15,624,4.530973451327434
2063336,4,B000260R82,"Beautiful Aida production by Zefferelli at La Scala Milan. This production is a little over done but beautifully set. The singers are amazing except that I found Alagna's infamous aria ""Dolce Aida"" to be sung in an almost forced and yelling voice. So far, I have just watched the Acts 1&2 first DVD, and so far I can tell you that you will be dissapointed by the anoying fading of pictures throught the video. This is done in a manner that you want to scream and say stop doing that!!!Just focus on the characters and lets enjoy the performance in a way that a seating patron there was enjoying it. By, the way the ballet at the end of Act 2 was very sexy and beautifully danced. 4 stars for the singing 5 stars for the ballet and 5 star for the sets and costumes. 0 star for the video direction.",1226966400,33,796,4.2781456953642385
2063337,5,B000260R82,Amazon's current listing of the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 is INCORRECT. Like all Blu-Ray productions (that aren't of classic films) Decca's new opera productions on Blu-Ray are 16:9 (or 1.85:1) and anamorphic (according to Ken of the Decca Music Group.,1226620800,9,249,5.25
2063338,3,B000260R82,"This La Scala production was promoted as the ""new"" version of the great 1989 Emmy-winning ""Aida"" from The Met. The La Scala production has much to recommend it: fine singing from Violeta Urmana as Aida and Ildiko Komlosi as Amneris; beautiful performances by the two featured dancers in the ballet (Verdi wrote great ballet music here); lively and nuanced conducting by Ricardo Chailly; and the full-bodied, spirited sound of the La Scala chorus. These are the five-star features of the production.

But I've just spent (too much) time watching the Beijing Olympics and so, with gymnastics and diving judges as my new role models, it's time to start taking deductions. Roberto Alagna never looks comfortable as Radames. At first, I thought he was just physically uncomfortable in his armor-laden costume. But, in the end, he's really a lyric tenor and this role shouldn't be in his repertoire. The only time he truly shines is in the Tomb Scene where his lyricism can soar; that's a long time for the viewer to wait for a performer to show his stuff! This must have been filmed on opening night because it was during the second performance that Alagna walked off stage minutes into the opera, after being booed at the end of ""Celeste Aida"" (which he sings poorly here too - hitting several sour notes). His untimely exit is well-documented on You-Tube wherein Ildiko Komlosi, in her regal Egyptian costume, walks onto an empty stage, looks confused but is soon joined by a guy in jeans and a leather jacket (Alagna's understudy) who walks out and immediately starts singing to her.

""Aida"" is Grand Opera but only works if the spectacle shares equal billing with the intimate, tragic tale it tells of forbidden love. This production falls short here too because, as good as the singing of the two principal women is, their acting is too wooden. With the exception of Urmana's moving rendition of ""O patria mia,"" none of the leads ever become flesh and blood characters to me.

The stage does indeed have the look of a spectacle. It is filled with ancient Egyptian looking statues and decorations, but I thought they looked cheap, not elegant. If you want to see beautiful sets in an ""Aida"" production, get the DVD of the 2003 Gran Teatre del Liceu of Barcelona production that features trompe-d'oeil sets painted on paper by Josep Mestres Cabanes for a production of ""Aida"" in 1945. Almost 60 years later, the sets were restored for the production. Seeing these paintings as sets is like being at a Catalonian art exhibit.

Finally, as other reviewers have pointed out, the filming in this La Scala production is poorly conceived. I don't mind if the video director takes creative liberties and doesn't just point the camera at the stage. But here, Patrizia Carmine gets creative at all the wrong times. So, right in the middle of an aria, suddenly the face of the singer may be completely obscured by out-of-focus flowing cloth. Or, even worse, in the middle of a duet or a trio when you need to see the players interacting with each other, statues or other stage decorations may suddenly be superimposed right over their faces. It's extremely irritating not to be able to see the players at these crucial moments in the drama.

Bottom line, I would recommend this ""Aida"" only for collectors or if the ""five-star"" elements I listed in the first paragraph appeal to you more than the ""deductions"" I've taken in the rest of the review.",1219881600,8,3434,4.803722504230119
2063339,5,B000260R82,"As a fan of tenor, Roberto Alagna, and having some knowledge of ""hypogylcemia""( with which he was apparently struggling), I was interested in this production.  Roberto is extraordinry in the lyric repertoire.  This was a venture into new territory. The lyric repertoire serves his voice more ideally than ""Celeste Aida"" but the remainder of the opera was a beautiful and nuanced performance, with a very moving tomb scene. I remain a fan of his and appreciate the whole cast and performance.  We have a world of ""armchair"" critics and singing
connoseurs with an inability to factor in our vulnerable human condition and the vicisitudes of life.  This is most especially true where the singer's instrument is his body, which applies here.  We demand a lot of these artists wih their jet-setting schedules, and yet are quick to spit out disparaging remarks and ""boos"".",1219622400,8,866,5.027972027972028
8022671,1,B000260R82,"The beserk inane videography and editing make this grand opera a creative flop. I agree with some of the reviewers that express some dissatisfaction at the singing but I thought it was OK. The sets were magnificent: opulent, over the top, garish in the best possible way for an Italian opera spectacle. However, the videography and DVD visual presentation is remarkably ill-conceived. I don't know the background of Patrizia Carmine  but, based on the understanding  of drama and spectacle she (I assume) shows here, she probably is best fitted for filming first graders' graduations and MTV pool parties. In the middle of climactic parts of arias, she cuts away to billowing fabrics and inanimate objects.  We are treated to a ridiculous view of a person's costume before they even appear on stage. And in the tomb scene, she doesn't even show Aida and Radames as they're singing and dying but instead concentrates on a stone statue and a priestess who isn't even a singing role.  There are probably productions with better singing but there have to be productions with better video.",1484524800,4,1084,4.972375690607735
8022672,5,B000260R82,"All I can say is: I cried my heart out, particularly because I bought this set right after Dessi's transition. Thank God someone dared NOT to go the Eurotrash way but revive a superb staging which is only a year younger than I am. As for the singers, they were all top notch, old fashioned Italians (except, of course, for Pons)  which also meant most of the the time they looked like they were directing traffic (compare with the Gencer/Bergonzi Aida in Verona).  To me, Amneris will always be Bumbry at the Met, but Fiorillo has what it takes.  Simply awesome performances, setting (I'd quibble about the costumes).  A set to own and to keep.",1473120000,,644,4.573913043478261
8022673,2,B000260R82,"This was probably an amazing show to witness live, but this DVD leaves much to be desired. For starters, no subtitles! One gets to choose a ""language,"" but apparently that is only for the written synopsis that is a special feature. Second, while the opera runs about 2 1/2 hours, this recording runs less than one hour, leaving out a lot of significant parts of the story. If the performance itself was of an abridged version of Aida, that should have been made clear on the packaging. As for the performance itself, it was enjoyable in many ways, but the sound was not very clear and neither was the picture. You get what you pay for, I guess.

8022675,3,B000260R82,"Let me start by  adding my voice to the choir of criticism to the incompetent, ""look at me"" video direction, particularly galling as it goes straight against the tasteful (if slightly boring) approach of Zeffirelli on-stage production.

The principals range from competent (Alagna as Radames) to very good (Guelfi as Amonasro, who steals his two scenes, in spite of what amazon's spelling-challenged editorial reviewer may think). What stands out in this Aida is the Scala choir and band: dramatically intense and always spot on. Chailly shows why he is the best living Verdi director (among other things...). Under a lesser director Aida can feel (painfully) long in the last two acts but here the tension actually keeps increasing till the funereal ending.

Technically this is an excellent Bluray, the stereo track is vivid and balanced at the same time, while the video manages to extract enough details even from the very dark fourth act.

In conclusion this may not be an Aida for the ages, but it is a very solid performance that has a place in any opera collection.",1408233600,2,1073,4.944444444444445

I have this opera as part of the Verdi Edition collection.  I haven't viewed all twelve of the operas in the set but the ones I have including Aida, Il Trovatore, Otello, Falstaff, La Forza and one or two others have all been excellent.",1398124800,3,658,4.5423728813559325
