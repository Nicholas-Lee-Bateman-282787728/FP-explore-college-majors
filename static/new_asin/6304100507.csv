789782,3,6304100507,"This movie is one of the few Disneys that truly feels modern, and - gasp - all those characters who have American accents are actually meant to have American accents as they are American!  (Unlike British settlers, French cats, Chinese females, etc).  The animation here is often more blurred and simplified but it suits the movie.  And the contemporary scenery looks great.  I love all the characters except Jenny who basically is stuck with the cute kid role, but I felt the movie was over too quickly, with everything being resolved too fast.  But I loved the music (if this was a musical I'd gladly perform in it - can I be Georgette?) and the bad guy.  Yesss!  Campaign for more gangsters in Disney!  Overall a likeable movie with a nicely contemporary outlook.",985996800,,766,4.706766917293233
789783,5,6304100507,"This is one of the only Disney films that I felt didn't insult children's intelligence and the stars that agreed to be in this film knew it. Bette Midler, Billy Joel and others agreed that this film would become a classic and they were right. The music is contemporary in flavor but still appealing to young people. The retelling of Dicken's tale in the big city is the perfect way to present this story to young people. Kudos to Disney.",972518400,7,437,4.475
789784,5,6304100507,"This Movie is the best Disney movie I ever seen. It got everything. I wonder why there is no Part 2 or a TV Series. Like Pocahontas and Hercules.  This two movies are never so good as Oliver & Co (so the name in  Germany).  So Disney, I waiting for a DVD Version in Germany.",967161600,2,274,3.9454545454545453
789785,5,6304100507,"this film with Hercules, Black Cauldron, Aladdin, Toy Story, Mulan, and Sword in the Stone are all my favorite Disney Movies. if your a child in  the 80's like me who grew up with Dark Crystal, Return to Oz, The Last  Unicorn, The Hobbit, Labyrinth, Transformers: The Movie and Secret of NIMH  then this should be added to your colleciton. it's very entertaining and  fun as well, and i would even recommend it to anyone who likes "" Con  Air"" and "" Commando"", and weither your a Kid or a Teen or a  Grown up then you will love this Movie.",965520000,3,538,4.2772277227722775
789786,4,6304100507,"Both in animation and graphic art, this movie looks very amateurish by today's standards, which offers such dazzling special effects (Just look at  ""Tarzan""...oooh!) Yet it shows its very obvious influence from  the old Disneyesque style quite similar to ""Fox and Hound"" and a  few other movies of the 1970s. Set in the contemporary New York City, a  stray little kitten suddenly finds a new home with a whole group of stray  dogs and their unkempt owner. But before Oliver can settle down, he  suddenly winds up into the arms of an equally parentless little rich-girl  waif who lives with her paunchy butler and a snooty prize-winning poodle in  a big 5th Avenue house that offers a big, fluffy bed and sweet treats in a  silver pet dish. No wonder Oliver is so disappointed when he gets kidnapped  back into his old home by his doggy friends. So the down-to-luck old beggar  uses innocent little Jenny's loss to deliver the kid straight into a  gangster's big, brawny hands. Despite its mostly two-dimensional drawings,  it is still a very jaunty action-filled fantasy adventure that will send  you into a truly hair-raising climax at the very ending! Also a big  milestone for Disney's very first installment of computer graphics into the  animation (just check out Mr. Sikes' MONSTROUS limosuine...Whew!)",965260800,4,1308,4.95852534562212

790238,5,6304100507,"I have always been a fan of Oliver and Company, since I had seen it as a child on the Disney Channel. I was not fortunate to own it on VHS as a kid, but over the years it is a part of my collection because I had purchased the ""main"" Disney Renaissance hits I wanted. In the final bits of collecting movies from the 90s I wanted, give or take a few that I didn't yet (Toy Story, Hunchback, A Bug's Life), albeit not truly Renaissance movies but still part of the 90s lineup.

This movie came to mind and I was reminded of how much I truly loved it, despite it not being the strongest of the Disney films that came out. The story is not as strong as say ""The Little Mermaid,"" or even the ""The Lion King,"" but Oliver and Company truly shines in its storytelling and grows better with age. However, introducing this movie to say a child would be quite different given that this movie is pretty dated. It is a 80s film, and in that aspect there are tons of things within it that may not be understandable to a child. However, it's truly a capsule in time about how the 80s and entry to the 90s was. Also, this movie has some remnants of other films within it, such as ""The Brave Little Toaster."" It bears similarity to the same overall feel, and was pre-renaissance for Disney. So it's truly interesting to see what was considered a flick back then.

The story is something most of us know if we're long-time fans, however... It takes place in 80s New York, where a cat who is unnamed until the middle of the film is sold along with other kittens. No one claims the kitten, so the cat wanders only to find how harsh life truly is in the city. The cat meets Dodger, a sly and witty dog who knows the city well. The cat follows Dodger back to his home, after being tricked, only to accompany new friends and companions, and also a future home. Oliver is conflicted with his own set of issues, where he realizes what he's been searching for is a home, and is torn two ways. It's an emotional story about ""home,"" family, and companionship.

I truly love the songs, as they are classic reminders of Disney prose. However, the story is lacking in some parts. There are so many questions, and sometimes it feels rushed. But Oliver and Company is a great film that ages well, despite its dated story. I highly recommend anyone purchase this if you're a Disney fan seeking to complete your collection, or to relive the movie for the first time on DVD.",1490918400,2,2437,4.293478260869565

I don't remember much about that vacation except going to this resorts private theater and watching this movie. I wanted to watch it for years after that. But for some reason my parents never bought a copy. So every time I'd see it on the satellite guide I HAD to watch it. Now as a grown adult in my thirties with no children, I bought the digital copy!

As for the movie itself, it isn't quite a Disney classic but more of a Disney cult-classic. It isn't very well known or advertised these days but it is still an enjoyable movie about Oliver the cat and the gang of dogs he meets who become his friends. It is an 80s twist to Charles Dicken's ""Oliver Twist"" but with a Disney-esque ending.",1470960000,8,571,4.287037037037037

This 25th Anniversary edition was great I was so happy to be able to find it in a Bluray DVD Combo. We have watched this as few times with my son and the soundtrack for this movie is great for an 80's movie, and how could you go wrong with Billy Joel being the voice actor of the dog. I find myself having half the songs stuck in my head after watching this. The quality of the DVD is great and was definitely transferred over very well. The movie in the beginning is very sad so just be warned when watching this with kids, but it's Disney so it automatically picks up after that.

I writing this review on a computer that runs at 3700*8Mhz so I can forgive the animation issues. all said this is a fantastic movie for the whole family and even though the animation isn't the best, the images are sharper and the colors are better on Blu-ray vs. DVD or VHS.",1468108800,,583,4.457943925233645

791004,5,6304100507,"This was bought for my daughters birthday this is one of her favorites from childhood.

Her generation was really the first to have so much access to VHS tapes and later to DVD's. So many of the Disney (and other studios) classic animated movies have only been seen at home. We always took her to see whatever Disney (or DreamWorks, etc) animated movie that was released when she was young but movies like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, etc have only been seen at home.  This is kind of a shame but that's the way the world works today.

The picture is clear and crisp - colors seems to pop like they should - sound was very good as well. I think the story (plot) is interesting as well. However, this movie is not in the same class as say Peter Pan or Little Mermaid - it's very good but quite simply not great. This was made when Disney just showing some signs of entering another classic period.

I think most young children will enjoy this movie - I would rate this a very good 8.5 to 9.0 out of 10 - well worth the money - especially if it is one of your personal favorites!",1466208000,,1088,4.2926829268292686

I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and I bought this as an adult for my boyfriend to watch (he has never seen it). I watched it by myself first to relive the great times a child and I cried through most of the beginning, first from sadness for Oliver the cat being the only cat that isn't adopted and becomes lost in New York. Then those sad tears quickly changed to happy when Dodger (Billy Joel) meets Oliver and sings Why Should I Worry while dancing in the streets. The rest of the movie is just as good as the first 15 minutes with a great storyline and characters. Being a Disney movie, it does have an obvious message. Oliver gets adopted by a rich girl with absent parents and Dodger belongs to a homeless man who is in debt with the mob. The rich girl and the homeless man eventually become odd friends showing that friendship and respect can bloom despite social class.",1461888000,,985,4.24468085106383

791855,3,6304100507,"Oliver and Jenny are cute, Dodger is cool, the music is fun. There are a lot of dark elements in the movie, however, and a bit more violence than I like for my 3-year-old daughter. It was a little bit scary for her at times with Sykes, the man that Fagin needs to pay (it's never answered why he's indebted to the cigar-smoking villain, and Fagin's personality makes me wonder if it was drugs or something, although the story makes it sounds like he borrowed money for dog food...) Sykes and his vicious dogs make for a scary element in the film. Dodger's gang survives by stealing. Georgette, Jenny's spoiled poodle, is mean. It's just not my favorite, but if you're not showing it to young children, it's fine. Just not the best.",1438387200,,731,4.503759398496241
791856,5,6304100507,"This classic was definitely apart of my 90s childhood; thankful as I am, my parents led me in a great direction to learn what it means to have a family. This movie (and soundtrack) pops into my mind every time I am downtown in my own city (skyscrapers), or when I am in big cities like Los Angels or Anaheim. Big city life for a homebound cat, can you say tough luck! This movie breaks the boundaries of what the definition of family has become over the years. Oliver represents all of those who may have had a fall out on family and yet. . .still come across others that cling to you on your new journey and remind you of your past. It also reminds you that reuniting with your family has many positive highlights: love, compassion and care. This warm-felt film makes you rejoice in life and reminds you that it is precious and worth the adventure.

to mind. When I think of memorable cartoons, 'Oliver' comes to mind.

I've commented before, about how people seem to watch the same cartoon, and come up with drastically different reviews.
I like how good the animation and layout is in this story. It is quality work.
'Oliver & Company' is a story of a young orphaned kitten, who is befriended by a gang. Eventually Oliver finds a home.

Adventure then ensues. I think young people will like this story, and the songs.

Cranky old people say everything was better in the good old days. I may not agree, however, if you watch 'Oliver' you will think
they are right.",1435795200,,756,4.669172932330827

The dog characters are really annoying, and this movie has one of the crappiest villains in any Disney movie. The songs are poorly executed, Why Should I Worry is the worst song in the whole movie. The animation is flat, and it's the worst from the Disney studio. A horrible movie, mixed with a few dazzling movies. This is not a movie I would ever watch again, it's that bad!

792436,3,6304100507,"Rushed into theaters during Disney's brief `rough-sketchy-looking' period of animation (1988).  The plot loosely follows Oliver Twist's sad tale of woe.  In this case, they've turned the little orphan into a cat abandoned on the streets during a deluge, left to drown in a cardboard box (did PETA know about this!!!).  The poor cat is hounded, left to starve if he didn't get run over first.  He briefly ends up in a gang/pack of dog thieves.  In a blink, he lands in an upscale home of a nondescript little girl.  The Disney folk managed to squeeze in a couple of chase sequences and a few forgettable songs into its 74 minutes.  The voice `talent' ranges from the ineffectual (Billy Joel as Dodger) to the sublime (Bette Midler as Georgette, a show-winning poodle).  At best, this simple little cartoon is cute, at worse, it's inconsequential and unimpressive.  There's a reason it's not a classic.",1420588800,,900,4.830065359477124

All the fine details are destroyed as a result and instead of seeing lines on wood for example that makes it look like wood, its just all one smudged color or mixture of 2 colors.

If you can get past that and don't care about the details that make it look nice, then they did a nice job at cleaning it up, they just did it far too strongly.

792754,3,6304100507,"Loosely inspired by Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, Oliver & Company takes place in New York City in 1988. Oliver (Joey Lawrence) is a kitten left to fend for himself on the streets after no one would adopt him. He meets the street-wise dog Dodger (Billy Joel) who initially rebuffs him. Oliver follows Dodger back to his home and meets a gang of dogs led by their homeless owner Fagin (Dom DeLuise). Fagin is in a tough spot because he owes money to a ruthless loan shark.

By Disney standards, this is a very average movie. The animation itself, while not terrible, often looks cheap. The film featured some early use of CGI and it does not always work. For example, cars in this movie often look like awkwardly moving rectangles.

Probably the biggest issue with this movie is the characters. For the most part they are all rather forgettable. The villain was rather clichd as an angry rich guy who chomps on cigars for much of the film.

The movie is probably best summed up in Roger Ebert's words as being ""harmless, inoffensive."" It certainly is a family-friendly movie, but unfortunately a rather forgettable one.",1411257600,,1119,4.728205128205128

793166,5,6304100507,"This is a great disney. This is a moive you should see. The songs are amazing and so is the moive.

Summery:Oliver is a homeless kitten. All of the other kittens expect him were taken from the box they came from. Oliver meets doger,a street dog. Doger tricked Oliver into getting hot dogs. Oliver ran after him and met dogers gang:Tito,rita,Francis,and Einstein. Doger had to help his master,fagin. Sykes,a gangster,wanted money in three days. So Oliver now is involved in fangin plan. Who knows? It might pay of.

Message:Well there's really no message to this moive. Well maybe family. When doger got Oliver back from Jenny's house,that shows how much he cares for Oliver. Now Oliver understands.

The 25th anniversary for DVD will make a great choice. There's another DVD that has Oliver and Company,the fox and the hound,and the fox and the hound 2. So if you want three moives in one DVD then get that one. This DVD is also good for anyone who likes those three moives.

The songs in this moive is great. Why should I worry? Is the best one. It's so catchy. Just the name is.

The movie has a great soundtrack (I've still got my original vinyl copy!). It was one of the first animated films in which Disney used computer animation, and many of its animators went on to create various other Disney favorites. Until the release of Disney's Oliver and Company, animated films could never compete with live-action films. It was a huge success at the box office, blowing live-action films out of the water, and many at Disney credit the film for opening the door for other films such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and even The Lion King. How do I know all this? The Bonus Features on the blu-rau disc. :) So, buy the movie, watch the movie (with and without the ""sing along"" setting!), and then watch the Bonus Features- you won't be disappointed.",1395792000,2,923,4.566265060240964

Instead of a being an orphan and letting children see an unwanted child, we see Oliver as a kitten that was a different color so no one wanted to adopt him. Making the story take place in a world children were use to they change London, England to New York City, USA.

793566,4,6304100507,"Disney Studios 27th full length animated feature film. Oliver and Company is a decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with a return to the musical format that made the early films so memorable, Disney continues with their great animation and ground breaking achievements although the period from 1961 to 1989 are not my personal favorite years. I stopped watching Disney animated films around the time The Fox and the Hound came out so I am not all that familiar with the films from that period until The Little Mermaid. Ever since Disney had started the Xerography process with 101 Dalmatians their films while still excellent quality, they just didn't have the Disney luster from the early years. The new films have a much more flat look to me and it just doesn't thrill me the way the earlier films did.

The film itself is one of the most different films up to this point, with contemporary music artist in lead roles and singing their songs. The music is quite good and there a some snappy songs. It's not my favorite Disney animated film, but it's a worthy addition to the continuing evolution of Disney's animated film library.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I own the original DVD release and the new Blu Ray and the Blu Ray is a very pleasing upgrade with much richer colors and it looks just about perfect.  The film was released 1:66:1 on the first two DVD releases, but the new Blu Ray is 1:85:1, which is probably the true ratio.  I'm happy to be past the years where the aspect ratio was such a problem on these home video releases(1961-1981). These films should have been released with multiple formats included on each edition.

The extras are thin and there isn't anything new worth mentioning, but at least there is a very short 'making of' featurette ( a little over 5 minutes) which I think every one of these films should have gotten. There is room for more on this release, but the film looks great and there are some interesting tid bits here.

If you must own Disney's Oliver and Company the Blu Ray is the way to go. The film looks great and I doubt will see any substanial bonus material on fiture releases.",1385510400,2,2155,4.569948186528498

793716,4,6304100507,"I have NEVER seen this film look this good before. Sure, they wiped away some grain and the image can seem pretty bright/dark at times but this sure allows you into the animation cells like no other version has. I would guess they could improve some of the contrast and coloring but I never expected them to take much care here. Some of the detail here is astounding compared to past releases. I really loved this film as a child and it is very nice to revisit it now on bluray to admire the animation and direction.

It isn't as good as the top releases and doesn't seem as timeless but I know the characters and script are warm and inviting and kids should really enjoy the show imo. Better than a 95% of the stuff out there. I can't give it a full 5 stars but for what is there this is an easy buy for adult fans of animation and kids as well.

I would be interested to know how much of an overhaul Oliver got for his new blu transfer. Certain scenes could be rough, certainly, but there in a blink-and-you'll-miss-them sporadic appearance. For the most part, the image is crisp and clear with stable color and a certain amount of depth. If this isn't the best that Disney can do (and I hesitate to say it is, knowing Disney's track record with what they consider their lesser film entries), then it's a fine place to start! I can only imagine what a full overhaul would bring out in this lovely film! The sound quality more than makes up for what the pictures lacks, however! Booming bass, crisp dialogue, suitably immersing surrounding noise.. Very, very good job on the audio Disney! All in all, a middling entry on the technical front. If you're a fan or a first time buyer, Oliver and Company deserves a spot in your library!",1375833600,,1048,4.639784946236559

793794,5,6304100507,"I loved this movie in the past and Disney has done a great job bringing this movie back in great high definition on this new Blu-ray. I have always been a fan of the Oliver Twist story so Disney did a great job turning that story into a great new one with character that you will simply adore and some great actors/singers behind the voices as well.

You get to see the underbelly of New York and go along on a great adventure too. My daughter had not seen this before so they really enjoyed it. I think they also enjoyed it because I was able to tell them that they were hearing some singers that we have helped them get to know as well.

All-in-all this was a great new release and whether you have seen it before or not, I encourage you to pick up this new blu-ray today - you won't be disappointed!

794124,5,6304100507,"Growing up, there were few films I watched as much as `Oliver and Company'.  It was my favorite movie and I think I went through about three VHS tapes.  Between this and `Beauty and the Beast', I was constantly singing throughout the house (`Why Should I Worry' brings an instant smile to my face).  As a father, I'm always wondering why they can't make cartoons for kids like they used to.  That isn't to say that the animated films presented to children today aren't progressive and engaging in their own right, but the films that came out in the late 80's, early 90's were just so superior (although, I'm bias thanks to nostalgia).

`Oliver and Company' is an animated take on Charles Dickens' `Oliver Twist', this time substituting the characters for animals.  Oliver is a young stray cat who is all alone until he meets Dodger, a street dog who works with a group of thieving dogs for their master Fagan, a simpleton yet kind hearted man.  Oliver gets accepted as `one of the dogs' but no sooner is he `at home' a job goes awry and Oliver is separated from his newfound family.  He meets Jenny, a young girl who falls in love with the kitten and takes him home as her pet.  Dodger and his gang, thinking that Oliver has been kidnapped, set off to rescue their friend.

A landmark in animation, `Oliver and Company' was the first animated film to incorporate computer images with the hand-drawn animation used in animated films prior.  The animation is sharp, the characters are beautifully detailed and the overall effect is wholly memorable.

With great music, a memorable plot and heartwarming character development, `Oliver and Company' soars and remains one of my favorite animated films ever made.  My children adore it, and it is a great family film.  It teaches the morals of right and wrong in a fun and spunky way, and while the depiction of `evil' can be rather one-dimensional (most animated films of the 80's depicted evil with cigars and deep voices) it doesn't take away from the impact of the film at all.  Joey Lawrence's voice work is outstanding (perfect casting) and the grand finale will certainly leave a lump in your throat.

They sure don't make them like they used to!",1358726400,,2197,4.682291666666667

794357,5,6304100507,"Oliver and Company is a 2009 re-release of the 1989 Disney animated classic based on Charles Dickens' timeless classic Oliver Twist. In this film, Oliver(Joey Lawrence, Blossom)is an orphaned cat living in New York City when he is befriended by a group of lovable but shifty dogs led by The Dodger(Billy Joel in his Disney animated debut). But when Oliver is threatened by a ruthless millionaire named Sykes(Robert Loggia), it is up to the Dodger and his crew to save Oliver and bring him to a new home. The voice cast includes Bette Midler, Cheech Marin, the late Dom DeLuise and Sheryl Lee Ralph was at its best, and the music by Billy Joel, Bette Midler, Ruth Pointer and Huey Lewis was great to listen to. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the film, two Disney shorts including Pluto and Sneak Peeks of Disney favourites include The Princess and the Frog, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure and Space Buddies. Oliver and Company is one of the best modern Disney films everyone will enjoy.",1350950400,,1015,4.7727272727272725

794359,5,6304100507,The family watched this for the first time and really enjoyed it. This is the Disney release that just predated the Disney renascence which came with the Little Mermaid. After all these years I wish we had viewed the film before. The film is a bit dated in terms of presentation (has a real 80's feel) but the story was charming and little Oliver (a young Joseph (Joey) Lawrence whoa!) was cute.,1349568000,,395,4.5

However, I was told it was in good condition and that it is. It plays fine. No skipping. Audio matches mouth movement. I am very happy with what I paid for.

794443,5,6304100507,"Oliver & Company is one hour and thirteen minutes and was released in theaters on November 18, 1988. This would be the last Disney movie to be around seventy minutes or less; all future movies would be eighty to ninety minutes or even longer. Oliver & Company tell the story of a young kitty cat named Oliver who is abandoned in New York City and is taken in by a group of dogs who leader is named Dodger; the dogs owner is Fagin who is a petty thief and not a good one at that. Fagin takes in Oliver as part of the gang. Later on in the movie Fagin kidnaps Oliver after he is taken in by a girl named Jenny. Fagin does this so he can get ransom money from her to pay off his debts to Sykes. The plan backfires and Sykes kidnaps Penny. Fagin, Dodger, Oliver, and the rest of the dogs go after Sykes to rescue Jenny. Jenny is saved and is reunited with Oliver once again. This is mainly the cliff note version of the movie. I mainly want to write about some of the facts and trivia about the movie itself.

Oliver & Company was a box office smash, but mainly received negative reviews. This was Disney's first musical animated movie in eight years since they released the Fox and the Hound and the last movie before the Little Mermaid kicked of the Disney Renaissance. Just like the Lady and the Tramp, 101 Dalmatians, and the Aristocats, they made this movie from a cat\dog's point of view and the animators shot photos eighteen inches off the ground from the streets of New York City. Oliver & Company was to be a sequel to the Rescuers and have given the character of Penny more development, but the producers scrapped the idea because they thought it would not sell. Two final pieces of information about this movie are: Peg and Jock from Lady and the Tramp and Bongo from 101 Dalmatians make a cameo appetence in Oliver & Company in the only names used from the Oliver Twist story are Dodger, Fagin, Oliver, and Sykes.

Now a few words about the DVD, in my opinion some of the extras in the Bonus Features could have been left out or included more information and a good example is the Making of Oliver & Company. The Making of Oliver & Company is a short segment that gives you a cliff note version for the making of this film and should have more information. The same goes with Disney's Animated Animals was a joke in itself; too little information. The two shorts: Lend  A Paw and Puss Caf are enjoyable to watch. Oliver & Company gets an AAAA++++.

794446,3,6304100507,"This movie was produced in the late 1980's, which many consider to be the era of less-than-stellar Disney features.  While I enjoyed the premise (Oliver Twist with cats & dogs in modern-day Manhattan), the story, the voice casting and the wonderful, upbeat songs (Huey Lewis, Billy Joel, Bette Midler), for me the animation really fell flat.  It looked like mass-produced late 1970's Saturday morning cartoon fare.  Disney classics such as Bambi, Dumbo, and Lady & the Tramp all feature animals drawn with an amazing, almost human expressiveness in their countenance.  Sadly I thought this film fell short of Disney's usual high standard.",1336089600,,638,5.2254901960784315
794447,5,6304100507,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  ""Why Should I Worry"" was a great Billy Joel song and Jenny was so kind to Oliver.  It SERIOUSLY TICKED ME OFF that Sykes not only threatened Fagin but also attempted to hold Jenny for ransom and his dobermans scared me when I was a child!  Georgette should have been kinder to Oliver and more disciplined and Rita is quite Georgette's opposite!  I thought that when Sykes was hit by the train, HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED!  The funny part of this movie is Tito's behavior and just so those of you who don't know do, he's played by the same guy who did the The Lion King's Banzai, Cheech Marin, a major comedian!  This movie has a great plot and great songs, I RECOMMEND IT!",1334188800,,689,4.2615384615384615

794554,4,6304100507,"I remember when I was a little kid seeing this movie for the first time in theaters. I loved every moment of it. It was one of those films that really left an imprint on my childhood. Growing up I so wanted to watch it again, but Disney wasn't releasing it on video. It wasn't until 1996 that Disney decided to release this under-appreciated gem.

Having watched it again as an adult, does it hold the same magic. In a sense, yes. The story is a beautiful one, full of charm, inspired by Dicken's classic, Oliver Twist. Instead of using an orphan boy, this movie focuses on an orphan cat named, - you guessed it - Oliver! The story of his friendship with the dogs and the homeless man Fagen, along with the conflict created by being adopted by a new pet-owner, Jenny, creates a fun and touching story. Billy Joel is amazing, full of flare, as the dog Dodger. Cheech Marine does a great job as the yappy Chihuahua Tito. My favorite character in the film is Francis, the English Bulldog who can quote Shakespeare. The villain in this film is one of the scariest villains in a Disney pictures, Sykes, a ruthless loan shark who seems too close to reality for comfort.

So, with great characterization, witty humor and classy songs, why is this movie only four stars instead of five? It's because as an adult, as much as I love it, it left me wanting just a little more. I fell so in love with the gang of dogs, and Oliver, and Fagan that I would have loved more screen time to develop these characters. The transition between Fagan to Jenny happened way too early in the film. I understand that since this movie is geared towards younger children that they had to keep it shorter, but I don't think it would have hurt to have had fifteen more minutes of screen time for developing the above said characters. On the contrary, I think it would have worked wonders.

Still, all in all, this is a fun-filled film, a gem, and an underrated Disney film.",1322352000,,1943,4.421787709497207

794718,5,6304100507,"Oliver (Joey Lawrence) is an orange kitten, one of a litter of eight, whose siblings have all been adopted out of a big box on a Manhattan street, leaving him alone.  When a sudden thunderstorm destroys the box and sets Oliver adrift alone on the streets, he's bewildered and frightened--and, very soon, hungry.  A carefree terrier named Dodger (Billy Joel) offers to share some sausages with him if he'll help to steal them, then takes off with the booty, and a furious Oliver trails him, not without difficulty, to his hideout, a moldering barge anchored under a decrept pier which he shares with a human named Fagin (Dom DeLuise) and four other dogs--hyper Chichuahua Tito (Cheech Marin), aging and easygoing Great Dane Einstein (Richard Mulligan), cultured bulldog Francis (Roscoe Lee Browne), and leggy poodle-mix Rita (Sheryl Lee Ralph).  Fagin has borrowed money from Bill Sykes (Robert Loggia), who is pressuring him to pay it back, and when Sykes visits the barge to demand his dough and Oliver rakes one of his Dobermans (Torean Blacque, Carl Weintraub) across the nose, Fagin (""That took guts!"") and the dogs are impressed and ""adopt"" him into the gang.  Next day, trying to help Fagin and the dogs find a way to pay back his debt, Oliver is accidentally trapped in a limousine, where he meets Jenny (Natalie Gregory), a little uptown rich girl who falls in love with him immediately, takes him home with her, gets him a collar and tag and a silver dish engraved with his name, plays with him in Central Park and lets him sleep in her bed.  When the dogs, fearing he's in trouble, innocently ""rescue"" him, he's devastated--all he ever wanted was a home and someone to love him.  But when Fagin tries to extort a ransom for him from Jenny, and she then falls into Sykes's hands, it's up to Oliver, Fagin, and the dogs--including Jenny's parents' spoiled diva of a champion poodle, Georgette (Bette Midler)--to save the day.

Based loosely on Dickens's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oliver-Twist/dp/0486424537/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oliver Twist</a>, this movie will have viewers who are familiar with the book (like me) making interested connections between the original and the adaptation (Fagin, for example, is not Dickens's sinister Jew but a rather buffoonish street person).  It's rather short on music, but Joel's strutting ""Why Should I Worry?"" and Gregory's gentle ""Good Company"" are high points.  Each animal is a distinct individual with a personality of his own.  And when ""Oliver and Company"" set out to rescue Jenny, it becomes a wild thrill ride through the loan-shark's hideout and across a railroad bridge.  It also has things to say about friendship, honesty, love, and finding your proper place in life.  A sweet and charming film for cat- and dog-lovers alike.",1264809600,,2839,5.147826086956521
794719,3,6304100507,"Loosely based upon the novel ""Oliver Twist"" by Charles Dickens, this Disney movie scampers after the adventures of a stray kitten- Oliver- as he meets a pack of friendly mutts and weaves through the wild New York city, going through danger and heart-wrenching situations to find the girl he came to love as his owner.

I re-watched ""Oliver and Company"" just for an old kick, as I hadn't watched it in some time, and I was surprised by how much of the old greatness had worn off from this movie. The animation is still fresh and well-done, and I can't say the acting is bad, because it's fine. Sure, maybe the plot is lacking, and the characters aren't as enjoyable as previous ones, but just about all the aspects of this movie are fine. Yet this movie just feels different.

After a few movie failures dotting the time-line of the 1970s and 80s for Disney, I feel that they simply lost a bit of heart. They were no longer the warm, fuzzy animators who presented us with movies like Lady and the Tramp, Snow White, and other earlier Disney movies. They were disappointed people, and I think this took a toll on some of their movies- including this one. This movie is a whole lot darker; not quite as bad as The Black Cauldron, yet it's featured in New York, and has got violence, smoking, a strange, almost frightening ending, and an array of poor, dirty animals brought up by a homeless bum.

Yeah... not the best plot for a Disney movie.

And yet... this movie is not really a failure. It's got some better scenes that desperately aim to make up for the less-impressing ones, and a couple foot-tapping songs, following along in the classic Disney format of a musical animated movie, and I suppose some parts can be called touching. If you call cliche happy parts and singing birds touching, that is.

So really, this is not the kind of Disney movie that deserves to be up on the shelf along with ""Lion King"" or ""The Little Mermaid""; more like a movie you rent for free, then wait a few years, and buy it at a yard sale for ten bucks. I just don't feel like it's completely worth twenty dollars, though it is certainly worth a watch.",1264291200,,2134,4.461538461538462

794791,3,6304100507,"This was an animated Disney feature which was a free re-working of Oliver Twist, set in modern New York. It seemed to vanish without a trace after it's initial release, twenty years ago - which was a pity, for although the animation work is pretty pedestrian - the first to rely heavily upon computers, and  not much above the level of a Saturday morning cartoon feature, the voice work was amusingly several cuts above. Where else to find  Billy Joel doing the voice of a shrewd street mutt named Dodger,  Bette Midler as an extravagantly pampered poodle, Georgette, Cheech Marin as (of course) Tito the Chihuahua, Dom Delouise as the hapless Fagin - and then-teen star Joey Lawrence as the impossibly cute (yet feisty) kitten, Oliver? There are even heartbreaking glimpses of the World Trade Center towers, in some of the city-scapes. The villainous Sykes and his menacing Dobermans are perhaps a little too frightening for very small children - but on the whole, it is an enjoyable outing, if very, very short one, being only a little over an hour of viewing time.

Of the extra features, I found the most watchable to be a pair of classic shorts featuring Goofy and cats: ""Lend a Paw"" and ""Puss Caf&eacute;"", with Goofy alternately rescuing a kitten, and defending his yard, his milk bottles, and his fish-pond from a pair of hungry moochers. (Slight detour there, while I reminded my daughter that milk used to be delivered, and homes would have bottles of milk actually sitting on the porch. Just for fun, I wondered what breed the invading cats (Siamese?) and Goofy is supposed to be, exactly? Mastiff? Great Dane? Dog of no breed?

Knowing how wonderful past animated Disney movies based on cats or dogs delighted us (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aristocats/dp/B000XUOIQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aristocats</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-and-the-Tramp/dp/B000B8QG4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady and the Tramp</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/101-Dalmatians/dp/B000YERP2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">101 Dalmatians</a>, etc.), I bought it.

Boy were we disappointed! The animation wasn't that great and the film felt very dated rather than timeless--especially with the inclusion of 80's era vehicles, Billy Joel music/beats, breakdancers on the sidewalk, etc.

But that's not the bad part, really. None of the characters were memorable--we are given no reason to care for any of them. There is a lot of cigar smoking, violence, threats and menace. Who wants that in a Disney movie? (Yes, I realize it's based loosely on Oliver Twist--hence, Fagin and company--but it's an awful adaptation.)

The plot was lame--The Aristocats portrays a similar theme with much more panache, heart, admirable voice acting, lovely animation, and FANTASTIC music. If you want to get an animated cat movie, get that one instead!

My son, who has lower standards than I do (chuckle) said he wanted to ""sell it at a yardsale"". He has never, EVER done that with an animated Disney movie--and after the first viewing!

Seriously, pass on Oliver and Company--especially with its high price. You're much better off getting something from the Platinum collection--Pinocchio, Cinderella, etc.--than this awful movie.",1237852800,13,1928,6.482490272373541
794794,3,6304100507,"It's difficult to define an era of Disney as lesser or greater than another. The 1980's are thought of as a lesser era, yet they produced The Fox and the Hound, The Great Mouse Detective, and The Little Mermaid, three classics of the Disney canon. That three out of six movies released by the studio in ten years weren't classics doesn't show how low Disney had gone as much as it proves how high their standards had been previously.

Oliver and Company is a cute movie, but it is also thoroughly mediocre. Young kids will love it, as young children like every animated movie. But, unlike most Disney movies, Oliver and Company doesn't hold up for adults. I watched it for the first time in ten years last night, and my attention wandered away on several occasions. The characters aren't as well-developed, their interactions aren't as enjoyable, as in other Disney films. What this feels like is a Disney movie going through the motions, which is the way you can tell the bad ones from the classics.",1233964800,5,1000,4.649717514124294

I saw this when i was 4! anyway great buy for $19.99 at Target. I highly recommend this film to people who are intermediate with Disney Classics! a must Buy!",1233705600,2,458,4.043956043956044
794796,4,6304100507,"This is one of the first Disney movies I remember watching in the theater as a young child.  I loved it so much back then and remember having to get all of the McDonalds happy meal toys they had including the musical ornaments.  Unfortunately I don't think they had alot of merchandise for this film as they do with most other Disney films and that makes this movie almost forgotten until now!

Oliver and Company 20th Anniversary Editon DVD released on Feb. 3rd, 2009.  A little over 20 years from its holiday 1988 theatrical release.  Has it really been that long?  I bought the DVD the day it came out at my local Disney Store.  I also was surprised to see that the Disney Store at my mall was selling Oliver and Company Plushes and they were discounted when you bought the movie.  Since I have seen virtually no merchandise for this film since 1988, I had to grab one so I let my son pick one.  He picked Dodger and we went home to watch the film.

First of all let me tell you my first impressions.  The shiny cover that boasts the 20th anniversary edition on the front is nice and fits in nicely with all my other ""Special Edition, Platinum edition"" Disney animated films that I own.  Now first impressions are always good, but how does the DVD hold up?

Well, let me say this.  If you already own the original release on DVD, you might want to think about this before you upgrade.  The bomus features are exactly the same except for one new game that was only included in this release.  The cartoon shorts are the same, the sing along songs are the same, the doocumentary is the same.  Everything is exactly the same.  However I have never seen the original DVD so I cannot compare transfers.  But lets talk about that.

The transfer is AMAZING.  Not sure if it is just as good on the first DVD release or not since I have never seen that one, but let me tell you that the film looks great and even better than it did in theaters 20 years ago!  Vibrant colors, great sound brings 1980's New York City to life.  I am very very impressed.  Not that I was expecting any less from Disney however.

Special Features:

* All new Oliver's big city challenge game. (A fairly easy DVD game that is actually fun for kids.  It is more puzzle oriented than trivia oriented.  Not on original release)

The Following Was Already Included In The Original DVD Release:

* The making of Oliver and Co.  (A 5 min documentry from 1988 that talks about the making of and the computer technology used in the film.)

*  Shorts - ""Lend a Paw"" starring Pluto, and ""Puss Cafe"" also starring Pluto.

*  Theatrical Trailer, TV Spots, Production Gallery

Technical Specs:

Dolby Digital 5.1 SS
Spanish and French Language Tracks
Widescreen (1.66:1) enhanced for 16x9 televisions.
Digitally Mastered

So is it worth the upgrade?  If the transfers are the same or pretty close, I would say no.  If this release is sinificantly better, then yes.  If you don't own this film, this is definately the version to get.  I give this release 4 out of 5 stars.  The Film gets 5 stars the release gets 3 since they could have added more special features.  That averages out to 4 out of 5 stars.  So if you don't own this underrated classic, now is your chance!  This will probably be the definitive version since Disney doesn't promote this film a whole lot.  They didn't even do much promoting for this release!!!  We could have/should have had more, but for what it is.... its still great!",1233705600,2,3458,4.44888178913738
794797,2,6304100507,"When you discuss the animated films of the eighties, you may find that films such as ""An America Tale"", ""The Land Before Time"", and ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" are mentioned before anything From Disney makes it's way into the conversation.  This was not a good decade for Disney until ""The Little Mermaid"" floated onto the screen in 1989.  Prior to our introduction to Ariel, the Disney landscape in the eighties was spotted with ""The Fox and the Hound"" (1981), ""The Black Cauldron"" (1985), ""The Great Mouse Detective"" (1986), and ""Oliver and Company"" (1988).

On February 3rd 2009, Disney will release ""Oliver and Company"" 20th Anniversary Edition on DVD.  With a story based on the classic ""Oliver Twist"" by Charles Dickens, an all-star cast featuring Bette Midler, Dom DeLuise, Cheech Marin, Billy Joel, Robert Loggia, Richard Mulligan, Joey Lawrence, and a sound track with songs from Midler, Joel, Huey Lewis, and Ruth Pointer, it is certainly tough to see where this could have gone wrong.  Not that this is a bad film, but it should have been better.

Oliver (Lawrence) is a kitten that is abandoned in New York City circa 1988.  Oliver is reluctantly befriended by Dodger (Joel, who auditioned for the role over the phone) and eventually accepted into the gang of dogs who have run of the city as they attempt to help Fagan (DeLuise) raise money to pay off his debt to the evil Sykes (Voiced masterfully by Loggia).  Oliver fits in with the gang but is eventually adopted by Jenny (Natalie Gregory) before being reluctantly rescued by Dodger and friends, and subsequently kidnapped by Sykes.

The story has some holes, but is generally fun, though the opening sequence of Oliver being abandoned and chased by vicious dogs may be a bit much for young children and turn them off before the film really gets started.

The cast is excellent but Marin steals the show as the other performers are hindered by a lack of character development.

Where this film really struggles is with the animation and music.  In the bonus feature ""The Making of Oliver and Company"" the fact that this is the first Disney film to truly embrace the use of computer animation is touted.  Unfortunately the result resembles a Saturday morning cartoon from the late seventies or early eighties.  The background seems flat, and there are inconsistencies in the artwork.

The music does not quite work either.  It had been some time since Disney had made an animated musical, and apparently it was deemed necessary at this point, whether the story supported it or not.  The songs are fine, and certainly performed by top talent, but they just don't seem to fit in the film and are sporadically placed.

 Add the flat animation to the forced musical aspect, and it is tough to make it through this seventy-four minute outing without becoming distracted.

There is not a lot of bonus material that wasn't included in the 2002 release, and what is here is weak at best, except for two bonus shorts from Disneys animated library.  Appropriately the two cartoons feature Pluto dealing with cats.  Both are great fun, and actually surpass the main feature in animation and storytelling.

The other bonus features include the previously mentioned ""The Making of Oliver and Company"" which is informative and entertaining but insultingly brief.  The kids may enjoy the bonus sing along sections and the ""Oliver's Big City Challenge Game"", but Disney could have included all the songs and the game will only appeal to the youngest of viewers. The featurette ""Disneys Animated Animals"" is too short and a bit self-serving, but the ""Oliver and Company Scrapbook"", ""Fun Film Facts"", and Publicity materials are enjoyable to view.

Recommendation: This will appeal to an audience within a select age range.  Not so young as to be disturbed by the emotional opening segment, and not too old to notice how the film fails in comparison to some of Disneys more recent classics.  Adults will certainly appreciate the performance of Marin who gleans a smile with every line, and may enjoy trying to spot the homage to other classic Disney canines and some inconsistencies in the artwork.  There are much worse ways for a family to spend an evening, but other Disney fare might be more fulfilling.",1233532800,5,4251,4.891213389121339
794858,5,6304100507,"This is still one of my all-time favorite animated movies, and was one of the first movies that I had the joy of seeing in theaters when I was a kid back in the day.  It has some of the best songs of ANY Disney movie (my parents got me the soundtrack on cassette which I completely wore out within a year), and it also helped pave the way for major actors and musicians to contribute to animated films.

Like the main description says, Oliver and Company was basically the turning of the page at Disney's animation studios from the older, fully hand-drawn (and sometimes stock or recycled) animation, to the more modern, computer-aided work that paved the way for mega-blockbusters throughout the 90's. Although for me, every one of Disney's main animated lineup of movies post-Lion King had gotten progressively worse and worse in terms of both animation and story quality, so it's no wonder they leave everything up to Pixar these days.

But I digress... as an avid Disney fan and collector, I highly recommend adding Oliver and Company to your collection.  All of the cast and characters are great, and it has some very funny moments, especially with Cheech Marin on board as the voice of Tito the chihuahua.  I'll be picking this up when it comes out on Tuesday, as my old VHS copy circa the 1996 theatrical re-release has seen much better days lol.

Oh, and if you're one of those supposed ""media elites"" who has to have every new release on Blu-Ray and are thinking about skipping on this one since it's apparently not ""worthy"" of a Blu-Ray release, get over it and pick it up anyway!  This isn't the kind of movie you invite your neighbors over to impress with your overpriced home entertainment center, or drool over being able to see every little pixel worth of detail.  No, this is a movie you actually sit back with the family and enjoy... imagine that! Besides, you'll be saving yourself at least $10-$15 by not having to buy the overpriced Blu-Ray version, and these days with the economy in the crapper and Mr. Hope 'N Change as President, that actually means something!  ;-)",1233446400,2,2089,4.639566395663957

794860,4,6304100507,"""Oliver and Company"", the 1988 classic animated family film from Walt Disney was indeed a special film.  I remember watching this as a teenager and being in awe of how Disney would capture the city of New York with it hand-drawn animation, how the film would feature Billy Joel in his first acting role and featuring music from Billy Joel, Huey Lewis and Bette Midler.  The film would be a classic.

But here we are 20 years later and ""Oliver and Company"" would now also be remembered as the film that would bring Walt Disney's animated films from the traditional hand drawn style and eventually leading it to the digital age as the first Disney animated film to incorporate computers.  Also, a new generation of Disney films that would have a slight bit of edginess for a family film and would lead to many other films that would follow the route paved by ""Oliver and Company"" such as ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" and many more.

""Oliver and Company"" is a fun, family film.  The film features quite a bit of songs sung by Billy Joel, Huey Lewis and Bette Midler and the animation, taking place in New York has this urban appeal.  But the film does have it's charming moments and without spoiling the film, for parents who have not seen the film, the film does have it's dark moments with the main bad guy Sykes and his dobermans trying to cause problems for the dogs but at the end, there is a death (nothing to scare the young children but guaranteed for a toddler to probably ask their parents ""what happened"".  In essence, this film is a family film but it does have it's moments that may scare younger children.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Oliver and Company"" is presented in Widescreen (1:66:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions.  The animation does feature new digital mastering but compared to the remastering of ""Sleeping Beauty"" for example which looks incredible for a film of its age, for ""Oliver and Company"", because the setting is in the late 80's and the animation is hand drawn for a large part of the film, it does have that feeling of an older film.  Computer animation was used for the vehicles and action sequences but the picture quality is very good for its age but it does show it's age.

But the film has been digitally remastered and definitely looks good for a 20-year-old animated film.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and sounds great!  The film is more or less dialogue and music driven and the music does come alive in the digital soundtrack.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The special features featured on ""Oliver and Company: 20th Anniversary Edition"" definitely has some major positives.  Included are:

  * Games & Activities - All-New! Oliver's Big City Challenge Game - I played this game with my son and it's not your usual, easy remote control type of game.  This one does involve some skill and memorization.
  * Backstage Disney - The Making of Oliver and Company - This featurette takes you back to when the film was created with interviews with Billy Joel, Bette Midler and other talent in the film.  Especially how the film would be the first for Disney as it utilized computers.  It's fun to see these older, bulky desktop computers used for the work back then.  But this was the first film for Disney to utilize computer animation. So, it was nice to see this featurette.
  * The History of Animals in Disney Films - There is a second short featurette featuring the history of animals on Disney films.
  * Return of a Classic - This was a short feature on the 1996 theatrical re-release of the film.
  * Shorts - Academy Award Winning ""Lend a Paw"" (1941) Animated Short and ""Puss Cafe"" Animated Short - These two Disney animated shorts features the popular character Pluto and a surprise addition to the special features.
  * Music & More - Sing-Along Songs - Features two songs from the film and includes subtitles for people to sing-along.

Watching ""Oliver and Company"" 20 years later when I first watched it in the theaters is a bit surprising, especially to see how far Disney has gone with their animated films.  Especially, knowing that this was the first film to utilize computers for its animation.  So, you see the merging of traditional hand-drawn style and computer animation.

I never realized it until now about how much product placement was used in this film but after doing research on this online, I realize that to make New York feel realistic in animation, you need to have those forms of advertisements in the film and the product placement was not paid product placement.

But for nostalgic reasons, it was really great to watch this film again and especially to watch it with my son.  All in all, twenty years later and Disney has done a great service by releasing this on DVD and giving it special treatment with wide variety of special features.  For those who own the 2002 version on DVD, the two are very similar in special features but the main difference is that the 20th Anniversary version is digitally remastered and includes the ""Big City Challenge"" game.  So, as of right now, this is the definitive version to get.

All in all, another wonderful and solid Walt Disney animated release on DVD!",1232755200,5,5227,4.665573770491803
794861,3,6304100507,"This 1988 was the 27th animated feature to come from the Walt Disney Company. It is somewhat loosely based on the Charles Dickens Oliver Twist story. Set in New York City, this tale is about Oliver (voiced by teen star Joey Lawrence), a homeless kitten who is befriended by Dodger (Billy Joel), a loveable mutt who leads a gang of dogs that must scrounge the NYC streets to get by. The gang is owned by Fagin (Dom Deluise), a down-on-his-luck man who is in debt to a ruthless loan shark named Sykes (Robert Loggia).  During a bungled petty-theft attempt, Oliver is adopted by a rich young girl named Jenny (Natalie Gregory). Oliver is quite happy to be in a loving home, but the gang misses him and thinks they need to ""rescue"" him. Once they get him back, Oliver admits he was happy with Jenny; Fagin sees this as his opportunity to blackmail Jenny's family for the money to repay Sykes. However, even this gets bungled as Fagin's heart warms to Jenny's pleas to get Oliver back. Just as Fagin is about to ""do the right thing,"" the evil Sykes swoops in with his Dobermans and kidnaps Jenny for his own reward. You'll have to watch the film to see how it ends!

Somehow, ""Oliver and Company"" just doesn't have the total hallmark of quality that you would expect from a Disney animated film. The characters and story are just fine, but the animation is inconsistent. This was the first Disney film to use computer animation to a higher degree, and the experimentation shows. The style of the movie attempts to mimic the look of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/101-Dalmatians-Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000YERP2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">101 Dalmatians (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aristocats-Special-Edition/dp/B000XUOIQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aristocats (Special Edition)</a>, but ends up resembling a Saturday morning cartoon instead. As for the character animation, the emotion and depth that you would expect from Disney is definitely apparent. Oliver the cat is extremely loveable and expressive, and Tito bears all the fun and sass you would expect from a character being voiced by Cheech Marin. My overall opinion of the animation is that it would appear that it was a fresh young team not quite as experienced as the ""old regime"" of the ""Nine Old Men"" who created the classic DIsney library that we all know and love.

There are plenty of fun characters here though; Bette Midler voices Georgette, a snooty and vain poodle owned by Jenny who is jealous of Oliver, the family's newcomer. Tito the Chihuahua is my favorite; Cheech Marin's voice and the animators combined their talents to create a very memorable character who has taken a liking to Georgette, although she initially wants nothing to do with a street dog. Dom DeLuise is characteristically a little over-the-top with Fagin, making it a little difficult to feel much sympathy for his situation. In previous live-action versions of this tale, Fagin is a scoundrel but the actors playing him also give him enough charm and heart that you definitely feel a connnection. Billy Joel does an amazing job as Dodger; Disney was unsure whether he had the chops to do a voice-over; his phone-in audition convinced them, and he is a masterstroke of casting.

There is plenty of talent in this film; Huey Lewis sings the movie's first song played over the credits, ""Once Upon a Time in New York City."" Georgette's big number, ""Perfect Isn't Easy,"" sung by Midler, was co-written by Barry Manilow. Ruth Pointer of the Pointer Sisters also lends her singing talents to the cast.

The sub-par for Disney animation shouldn't disuade you from watching this film; it truly is a cute movie with a heartwarming tale and memorable characters. This 20th Anniversary Edition also has a handful of fun extras:

Backstage Disney:

* The Making of Oliver & Company (5:30): This vintage documentary (most likely made at the time of the film's release gives a short overview of what went into the creation of the film. Taking 2.5 years to make and over 120,000 cels, this featurette works hard to convince audiences that traditional Disney animation is alive and well, and that computers are just a new tool with which the animators can expand their craft. ""Don't look for computers to replace human animators at Disney."" Roy Disney pops in to evoke his Uncle Walt, and explains how the animators pushed the computers to their limit by asking what they were capable of. Glen Keane, the supervising animator, explains the part CGI played in Bette Midler's big number, coming down a staircase. Keane breathlessly explains that without computers, the shot of Midler could never have been done in the past. I find this hard to believe when Iooking at the marvels created in the past by Disney's original animation team.

* Disney's Animated Animals (1:27): Another vintage featurette that is more fluff than anything else.

* Oliver & Company Scrapbook: 14 ""pages"" that show Concept Art, Story Development, Character Development, Behind-The-Scenes photos, and Publicity. This is a solid extra.

* Publicity Materials: Original Trailer (1988), TV Spot (1989), Re-release (1996), and ""Return of a Classic""

* Fun Film Facts: 9 ""pages"" of behind-the-scenes info.

Music & More:

* 2 sing-a-longs: ""Why Should I Worry"" and ""Streets of Gold""

Bonus Shorts:

* ""Lend A Paw,""  a 1941 Mickey Mouse cartoon featuring Pluto, who discovers a cute little kitten that quickly takes Pluto's place in Mickey's home. Plagued by jealousy, Pluto's conscience has a battle, as a Pluto Devil and Angel attempt to sway the poor dog to their side. Pluto's jealousy initially wins out, causing Mickey to kick him out of the house. When the kitten falls down the well, Pluto is given the opportunity to redeem himself; which side will he choose?!?

* ""Puss Cafe,"" a 1951 Pluto short that shows a less loveable Pluto than the previous short; this time around, he must defend his territory again from two cats who want to steal his food.

The one new extra is a game, ""Oliver's Big City Challenge.""

Technical specs: Video is widescreen (1.66:1) and enhanced for 16x9 TVs; Audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, with Spanish & French language tracks.

794933,3,6304100507,"Oliver & Company was the last film of Disney's so-called ""dark age"" during the '80s, an era that started back in 1979, when the great financial failure of ""The Black Hole"" led the company into great monetary problems which somewhat affected the quality of the projects that followed.  This 1988 film produced by Walt Disney Pictures wore the tag-line of ""The first Disney movie with attitude"", something that may have made it popular back in the late '80s but that somehow fell as the years passed.  Frankly, the""attitude"" may just be the reason the film doesn't pass being mediocre and why it'll probably take a very long time for it to become any sort of a real classic.  The film lacks in many aspects, especially artistically.

Very loosely adapted from Charles Dickens' timeless novel, ""Oliver Twist"", ""Oliver & Company"" follows the adventures of a small kitten named Oliver in his search for a home and a family to which he can belong.  Oliver first meets Dodger, a street-wise, ""cool"" dog (voiced by Billy Joel) who introduces him to Fagin's band of canine thieves.  Fagin is a homeless man who is in debt with the evil ganster, Sykes.  His group of dogs, the attractive Rita, the elderly Einstein, the art-loving Francis and the wanna-be-cool (or insufferable) chihuahua, Tito, try to help him out by stealing throughout the dangerous streets of New York City.  In one of their adventures, Oliver is accidentally taken away by a rich girl named Jenny (who bares a more than obvious resemblance to Penny from the previous 1977 hit film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rescuers/dp/B000096IAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rescuers</a>""), and the little kitten can't help but to finally feel at home in his new 5th Avenue mansion; even if he must deal with the six-time national champion dog, Georgette.  When Oliver is ""rescued"" and brought back once again to his previous home with Fagin and his gang, all of them become part of Sykes's wicked scheme to recover his lost money; at the same time, all of their lives might be in great danger.

Definitely one of Walt Disney Pictures's weakest efforts since Walt Disney's Nine Old Men left the company in the late '70s.  Though the animation is mostly good, Disney did try for a realistic New York City, adding touches such as dirt, trash, advertising, vandalized walls... all together creating a very unappealing setting indeed.  Perhaps, and I'm not sure if many would agree, a more idealistic view of New York City, even if less accurate, would have worked better and given the film a better outlook.  The scenes taking place in 5th Avenue or Central Park are definitely among the best in terms of visual appeal.  The next, and perhaps even worst, flaw is the insufferable voice acting.  Though often praised as grand, I personally think that the choices were very poor.  Yes, Billy Joel, Bette Midler and others are wonderful singers and actors, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee good voice acting.  The wanna-sound-cool Cheech Marin takes the cake as the most insufferable, unbearable, annoying, repulsive Disney voice actor ever and his role here as Tito is definitely the very worst (He went by rather unnoticed in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-King/dp/B00003CXB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion King</a>"" as Banzai, one of the hyenas); I couldn't help but cringe whenever Tito opened his mouth.  The songs are mostly good but a bit on the overrated side; only ""Once Upon a Time in New York City"" and ""Good Company"" come off to me as great, the rest are only so-so.  So in the end and overall, the film is enjoyable to watch from time to time, even with its lack in the artistic and sound department, it does have a number of endearing characters, good animation and an interesting and rather unusual plot.  Very different from what the term ""Disney classic"" has meant in the company's good years, but still tolerable.  Recommended.",1199059200,2,3997,5.137345679012346

794935,4,6304100507,"First of all, It's great movie. It has catchy songs, lovable charecters, and finely portrayed setting. The plot was a little questionable, particularly at the end. Stuff happens that really just doesn't make sense, such as a car getting it's tires scraped off from subway rails and having the exposed wheels ride on the rails perfectly. Also the antagonist is a little too evil. Now you might say, ""he's the antagonist, he's supposed to be evil!"" but seriously, the way he over-reacts to the smallest of things is just downright corny. For example: grabbing his gun before greeting a pizza delivery person just because he didn't order it.

Those are the negative aspects, but I'm sure any kid below the age of 13 isn't even going care about those. The rest of the movie leading up to the end is a great Disney classic.",1177459200,2,818,4.680555555555555
794936,4,6304100507,"The Charles Dickens book ""Oliver Twist"" was the inspiration for this book.  There have been many adaptations of ""Oliver Twist,"" and I found this one to be humorous and enjoyable.  The movie is a bit scary in some places, but otherwise should be suitable for most family members.

Oliver (voice by Joseph Lawrence) is an abandoned kitten in New York City.  Oliver stumbles about until he encounters worldly dog Dodger (voiced by singer Billy Joel).  Dodger lives a carefree life with pals Tito (voiced by Cheech Marin), Einstein (voiced by Richard Mulligan), and other dogs.  Initially Oliver believes that Dodger's world is a good place to be, but all the stray dogs work with Fagin (voiced by Dom DeLuise), and Fagin owes Sykes (menacingly voiced by Robert Loggia) money.  Sykes has very affirmative methods of getting what he wants.  Those methods include effective application of violence.

Jenny (voiced by Natalie Gregory) adopts Oliver and it seems as though Oliver's life is going to get better.  Unfortunately, Jenny's dog Georgette (voiced by Bette Midler) is not prepared to allow Oliver to take any attention away from her, so she plots to get Oliver out of the house.  Fagin captures Oliver and holds Oliver for ransom.  When Jenny shows up with her piggy bank, Sykes steps in and grabs Jenny, holding her for ransom from her wealthy parents.  The excitement is intense as we learn whether the dogs are able to defeat Sykes and return Jenny to her home.

This movie is rated G, but there are some dark scenes in this movie.  I suggest the movie is suitable for most children down to the age of four or five years, but younger children may find some of the scenes disturbing or too intense.  Most other members of the family should find this movie fun to watch.

This movie is kept from being too dark by a series of funny scenes.  There are also songs and dancing.  This movie shares some similarities to ""The Lady and the Tramp.""  If you enjoyed that movie, you should enjoy this one.  This movie is a favorite of younger children, and most adults should find it interesting as well.

Enjoy!",1163376000,,2104,4.722527472527473
794937,3,6304100507,"During the 80's, the studio hit an artistic, creative, and commercial slump. However, I still find that I quite enjoy Disney's 80's films, many of which experimented with computer animation, non-musical storylines, and different source materials. One of my favorite pre-Little Mermaid 80's Disney films is Oliver and Company. Boasting a soundtrack filled with great songs and a wonderful cast of characters, Oliver and Company finally gets the DVD treatment, albeit a less-than-stellar one.

For one, the transfer is good, but it could be much better and it has a fair amount of grain.

The bonus features could have been much better as well. A few fluff EPK-type featurettes, which are nice, but still fluffy, are sadly enough the meat of the bonuses. Also included, fortunately, are the original trailer, original TV spot, and the 1995 re-release trailer. Two sing-alongs are included as well as two classic Disney short cartoons.

Overall, it's nice to see Oliver and Company on DVD at last. This is probably the best DVD edition Disney will give it for at least a while, so if you're considering picking it up, go for it.",1129075200,38,1125,4.973404255319149

I first saw the movie on video in the early nineties, and I must have been in a bad mood, because it didn't stick with me.  But I just saw it again, in fact I watched it two times in a row.  My husband watched it the second time with me, and he loved it. I think that this video should be in every child's personal collection.  It has such a wonderful message of believing in yourself during tough times, compassion, friendship, love, and doing the right thing.

Set in Manhattan, the backgrounds and art of Oliver and Company are a treat.  I did not appreciate the art of this movie the first time I saw it.  The backgrounds and scenery are brushed with dark browns and blues, evoking the simultaneous urban grit and inexplicable pull of New York City.

Based on Charles Dicken's Oliver Twist, Oliver is a homeless kitten who falls in with a gang of stray dogs.  The gang is led by Fagan, voiced by the irreplaceable Dom Deluise.  (What would animated movies be without Dom Deluise?)  Oliver soon meets Jenny, a lonely, loving little rich girl, and he is torn between his two families.  The evil Sykes, to whom Fagan owes money, has plans to hold Jenny for ransom.

The music was not contempory to its time and the human characters lacked a lot to be desired. Here is what I expected (and in detail!).

795018,4,6304100507,"Disney's 27th animated classic does suffer from the fact that it was the last feature from the studio to hit before ""The Little Mermaid."" Of course this caused inevitable comparisons, and of course there is no competition between the two an any way.
""The Little Mermaid"" is in fact a superior film, but the comparisons are unjust because each film is supposed to be very different.
The characters are all likable, with the exception of Tito the chiwaua who just goes over the top sometimes to the point of annoyance. The story is very contemporary, simple, and it works very well. The songs, although every 80's, are still catchy.
The animation in ""Oliver & Company"" consists of stylized backdrops of New York City and characters that seem flat and hard edged. The best older classic that you could compare it to was 1961s 101 Dalmatians. The film makers made a commendable effort in making this film feel true to it's setting, and moreover give us NYC through a dog's perspective. The film's artists actually endured strange glances from New Yorkers, as they squatted or laid down on the sidewalks to draw the city from a dog's eye level. It's also a great kick to see all the animated human characters on the streets in 80's fashions. ( O/T Seriously, what were designers thinking back then? )  The Twin Towers also make a bittersweet appearance.
""Oliver & Company"" also was the first Disney film to extensively use computers. Whereas ""The Great Mouse Detective"" used computers for the impressive Big Ben sequence,  in ""Oliver"" the computer is used more.  The cars, the subway and many other elements are impressive uses of the new technology, which led the way for everything from The Flying Carpet in ""Aladdin"" to the ballroom sequence in ""Beauty and the Beast.""
""Oliver & Company"" is a fun way to kill 80 min of your time. It has many things to appreciate, it does what it was meant to do. I do not think it was meant to be a classic of Bambi-proportions. And because of it's humble roots, I find this movie to be well worth the purchase.",1025308800,8,2043,4.669444444444444
795019,4,6304100507,"Oliver & Company is a new twist on an Old story. This one has a little flare and music with a lot of personality. The story is around the street of New York City. And to let you know the emotional impact, it opens with an animated aerial view of the Manhattan Skyline - which includes the World Trade Center buildings. (This movie was made in 1988)
My favorite character - besides Oliver's innocence, is Bette Midler and Cheech Marin. They steel the scenes with their wit and humor. Very sharp and emotional are their deliveries of the lines.
The kids will relate to the young girl finding her new kitten and the adults can relate to those every threatening debts we all seem to have. The music is fun, but not consistent. (By this I mean all the songs are from different writers - there is no common thread in the music and songs.)

The film is worth a rental for the terrific voice talent: Billy Joel as a scruffy ""Artful Dodger,"" Bette Midler as a diva doggie, and Cheech Marin as a bug-eyed chihuahua.  Too bad the film's other characters -- including, sadly, the nominal protagonist -- are so bland and colorless in comparison.
_Oliver & Company_ marks several ""firsts"" for the Disney studio.  It was the first cartoon feature to make extensive use of computer animation.  It was also the first Disney film to feature a song with lyrics by Howard Ashman (and for all you trivia buffs, that song is the unmemorable ""Once Upon a Time in New York City,"" sung by Huey Lewis).
I'll end this review with a warning: Cheech Marin's performance takes every negative Hispanoamerican stereotype known to humankind and works it to the wall.  Most of the shtick is clearly improvised, a lone-gun variation on Cheech and Chong's infamous ""stoner"" comedy of the '70s and early '80s.  Is it funny?  Yes, but it's still deeply offensive.

The cool canine takes Oliver under his wing and, with the help of the rest of his all-dog pickpocket gang, begins to teach him how to survive on the wrong side of the law. But when one of their con jobs goes awry, Oliver ends up in the hands of a sweet, lonely, little rich girl named Jenny. Suddenly, Oliver is living the high-life in a Fifth Avenue penthouse, much to the chagrin of Jenny's prize-winning, pampered poodle, Georgette. When the old gang shows up to rescue Oliver from his ritzy new life, they're disappointed to find that he wants to stay with Jenny. Their human ringleader, Fagin, however, is more than happy to send Oliver home, if he can get a healthy ransom in the process. Fagin isn't really a bad guy, he's just one step above homeless and has a really nasty loan-shark breathing down his neck. Jenny shows up on the dark and dangerous docks to pay Oliver's ransom and rescue her little kitty, and her sadness is too much for Fagin to take, but loan-shark Sykes has no troubles from a conscience and sees a chance to make even more dirty money. He snatches up Jenny and plans to hold HER for ransom! Suddenly, Oliver, Dodger, Fagin and the gang find themselves on a desperate rescue mission to save Jenny from the ruthless Sykes and his bloodthirsty Doberman Pinschers, Roscoe and Desoto, and even Georgette is getting in on the heroic action!

There's no doubt about it, Disney's wonderfully charming classic ""Oliver and Company"" is one of the most dated animated films you'll ever see. Of course, that's a big part of its charm. What could be more ""`80s"" than 1980s New York City? How about the music of Billy Joel and Huey Lewis? I know they were two favorites of mine in the `80s! Okay, to be honest, Billy Joel and Huey Lewis aside, the `80s is something you look back on and mock rather than view fondly, especially the clothes, and Oliver and Company captures that aspect, along with many others, perfectly. So, it's dated. Everything is, really. Call it nostalgia. Anywho, as strongly `80s as ""Oliver and Company"" is, it rises above it! It is simply a great film! That's something that's easy to forget if you haven't seen it in a while. ""Oliver and Company"" is Disney's twist on Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist,"" and it is an EXCELLENT modernization! All the best characters are there, and the cast is star-studded! The piano man himself, Billy Joel, voices the artful Dodger, a canine so cool he puts Snoopy to shame (we still love ya, Snoopy)! The hilarious Cheech Marin is Tito the Chihuahua, animation alumnus Dom Deluise is Fagin, the divine Bette Midler is one of Disney's funniest characters as Georgette, Robert Loggia is the excellently slimy villain, Sykes, and a very young Joey Lawrence plays Oliver, just to name a few! With seamlessly incorporated computer animation and painstakingly acquired ""dog's eye view"" shots of New York City, ""Oliver and Company"" was the film that kicked off Disney's big comeback as an animation heavyweight, though this cute little film was easily forgotten in the wake of Disney's mega-hit, ""The Little Mermaid,"" the following year. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the magic of ""Oliver and Company"" yourself! Even the soundtrack is terrific, despite that it is powerfully ""80s."" And, it's amazing how well Disney has translated ""Oliver Twist"" into a tale about cats and dogs on the streets of New York without losing the heart of the tale and its underlying messages. The DVD is fantastic as well, especially for a single-disc Disney release! This is the way DVDs should be! In addition to the widescreen presentation of the film, you get a behind the scenes featurette from the original theatrical release, 2 shorter featurettes, a TV spot, theatrical trailers, a scrapbook gallery of art and other materials, 2 sing-along-songs, and the best part: You get two classic Disney shorts! Included as extras are ""Puss Cafe,"" a hilarious Pluto cartoon where the pup goes up against two troublesome felines invading his backyard, and ""Lend a Paw,"" the Oscar winning Mickey Mouse short in which Pluto saves a kitten from drowning and quickly regrets it.

I have made it a solid goal never to expose her to any of the grossly annoying modern Diz' movies, such as Frozen, with all the glitzy show tunes. Somehow she still knows all the songs and belts them out endlessly in a bombastic fashion to my dismay... that is why I push for OAC. This movie was released in 1988, I saw it in the theaters then and had a couple of the Mcdonalds plush tie ins that I loved. Shortly after this movie screened it was vaulted and would not be released for home consumption until 1996 at which point I was in High School and didn't care. When it finally came time to embrace my daughters Disney fixation this quickly came to mind and I am glad it did. Right off the bat we dive into a 'Bakshi'- light style of New York city animated. Darkish in that its NYC at its dankiest, Huey Lewis sings the title score.  Soon after Billy Joel rips into a tune ""Why Should I worry"" penned for the film.  Let go the Frozen kids, start singing this song! We also have a track by Bette Midler later on.  The voice talent here is incredible all around. Dom Deluise is Fagan (this is a Dickens adaptation BTW) and I think its his best work. Normally cant's stand the Dom but his comic timing here is on point.  Cheech shows up as a chiuaua dog... bit racist maybe but it works. Best is when Cheech keeps trying to hook up with the posh pure bred Bette Midler. Hillarious! Also Robert Loccia as a mob boss who is real A.F! The movie is lean and mean at seventy four minutes, another plus because it gets the kids to bed! Many consider this the last gasp, pre Diz renaissance, I think the movie is great, kids will dig and so will you.",1526428800,,1784,4.1773255813953485
