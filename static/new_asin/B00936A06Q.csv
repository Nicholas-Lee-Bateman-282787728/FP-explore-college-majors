5253835,4,B00936A06Q,"You don't compare these old movies to the new ones when it comes to visual effects, but this one exceeds its contemporaries and when you add in the storyline & performances, it's one of the better racing movies.
Love Jimmy Cagney !",1377216000,,231,4.523809523809524
5253836,5,B00936A06Q,"I enjoyed seeing the race track for the first two car races.  Both of them were filmed within a quarter mile of my residence, prior to it being razed.",1375574400,2,150,4.172413793103448
5253837,3,B00936A06Q,"James Cagney teamed up with director Howard Hawks for this uneven racing melodrama. Despite its 70-minute running time, ""The Crowd Roars"" (1932) loses some momentum off the track. Worth seeing for the impressive race sequences, Cagney's dynamism and solid performances by the Warner Bros. stock company. Fitfully entertaining, but not Cagney and Hawks at their best.",1364428800,5,366,5.553571428571429
5253838,5,B00936A06Q,I love this film. As an avid racing fan and historian this film is a must have. Good footage of old race cars and speaking parts from some racing legends. Billy Arnold winner of the 1930 Indianapolis 500 has a speaking part. 1932 Indianapolis 500 winner Fred Frame is profiled in the film as well.,1359590400,4,297,4.418181818181818
5253839,5,B00936A06Q,"Cinema legend James Cagney could always be depended upon to deliver an energetic performance, and in THE CROWD ROARS (Warner Bros. 1932), the dynamic actor turns in one of his best from Hollywood's fabulous pre-Code era.

Cagney plays a racing champ who tries to prevent his kid brother (Eric Linden) from entering the racing profession, and also wants him to break off his romance with a girl (Joan Blondell) whom Cagney considers is a goldigger. Things come to blows when Cagney's gal (Ann Dvorak) becomes fed up with his controlling nature and calls it quits, which drives Cagney to drink, resulting in tragedy on the track when he becomes responsible for the death of his best friend and fellow racer (Frank McHugh).

THE CROWD ROARS was directed by the great Howard Hawks who was a racing aficionado himself and was therefore able to infuse the production with a gritty authenticity that really comes across well. The realism is especially achieved by the location photography at the Ventura Raceway and the Indianapolis and Ascot speedways. In addition, several racing pros from the era appear as themselves, including Billy Arnold, Fred Frame, ""Shorty"" Cantlon and ""Stubby"" Stubblefield.

The thrilling action sequences on the track are well balanced by the sharply defined performances of the fine cast, chiefly Cagney, who commands our attention every time he's onscreen. His totally natural style and kinetic personality fit perfectly into each role he plays, regardless how diverse, and in THE CROWD ROARS we see Cagney's cocky racing driver go from fame to shame as the result of a guilty conscience over the death of his pal. A moving scene occurs later in the film where Cagney, now reduced to hopping freight cars and hanging around racetracks, is reunited with his sweetheart who's working as a hashslinger at one of the tracks. It's a touching scene, underplayed by Cagney and Dvorak, which then takes quite an emotional turn when Cagney suddenly breaks down, sobbing in Dvorak's arms. It's to the credit of everyone involved that they were able to deliver a good, well acted story punctuated by terrific racing action all within a tight running time of 70 minutes.

Warner's Archive Collection offers a very nice transfer of THE CROWD ROARS, which also includes the original theatrical trailer. This is prime Cagney at high-speed octane, and is highly recommended.",1359072000,5,2382,5.0688775510204085
5253840,5,B00936A06Q,"This was the first of several versions of the story line, and is I interesting in the historical context it represents in that respect. The characters were cleaned up and made more sophisticated in the later version, and there is where the focus of my fascination resides.  Of course, the scenes involving the Miller and Dusenberg racing machines  brought me to these films in the first place.",1353801600,2,393,4.850746268656716

8535011,2,B00936A06Q,"IMDB says this movie is 80 minutes long, but this dvd runs 70 minutes. what's up? I'll tell you. the next-to-last reel of the film is missing in this dramatically incoherent edition. one minute, Cagney's reconciling with Ann Dvorak, the next minute he's back working with his brother as if nothing happened between the two characters. sure, Hawks has a reputation as a guy who doesn't like mawkish scenes that spell out too much emotional information, but this is ridiculous!

so don't waste your money on The Crowd Roars until the good folks at WB decide to re-issue the movie in its entirety.",1431907200,2,594,4.766990291262136
