8644338,5,B00IP027IA,"As the film opens, we meet Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), a scrawny
but skillful young viking who lives in the tiny town of Berk that seems
to have become the stomping ground for dragons.  The elder vikings
spend their lives training to fight these fierce creatures.  Hiccup longs
to be a dragon-killing warrior himself, dreaming of capturing the
infamous behemoth known as ""Night Fury,"" but despite all his attempts
to do so, his plans backfire and he quickly becomes the target of mockery.

It isn't until Hiccup happens upon the very creature he hoped to slaughter,
that he realizes that killing is just not something he was meant to do.  In
fact, by showing the dragon a bit of kindness, Hiccup realizes that perhaps
these creatures are not what the Vikings have made them out to be, and that
he has the ability to tame these dragons.  But how to convince the town's
brawniest warrior, Stoik (voiced by Gerard Butler),  that dragons are harmless ---
especially when the vanquisher is your own father who has the highest of
expectations that his son will follow in his own footsteps.

How To Train Your Dragon is a kind, pleasantly pleasing film that establishes
a warm relationship between a boy and his dragon.  Thankfully, the animators
decided not to make these talking creatures for there is a  wonderful sense
of silent emotional interaction between the two main characters that invoke
real charm. Fortunately, the film also boasts some eye-popping action sequences
that actually make some if feel like a thrill ride.

DreamWorks has delivered an immaculate transfer for its Blu-ray presentation.
There is an unequaled level of clarity here.  For instance, take a look at the features
within each of the film's characters.  What particularly comes to mind is Stoik's
heavy red beard which comes across with an incredible amount of detail.  Sadly,
a lot of that detail gets lost in many dark sequences, so it isn't until we are treated
to well-lit day scenes that one really marvels at the crispness of this transfer. You
can't help but gaze upon the beautifully animated scenes of Night Fury learning how
to fly, cascading above the clouds and the gorgeous landscape below.  A lot of care
was obviously put into making this film a first-class animated effort.

The film's imagery is enhanced by vivid coloration.  Everything looks nicely
saturated.

As for the 3D itself, I think it's going to greatly satisfy those who enjoy a more
subtle effect rather than those like myself that like more gimmicky effects.
Certainly, the film has been animated so that there is proper spacing and depth
present.  One of the most notable examples is in the forest sequences where
trees and low-lying branches are placed in front of the animation beneath it.
The flying sequences also show a great deal of depth between sky and landscape.
The big problem I found here is that there is a lot of scenes that take place in
the darkness of night, lit only by fire, which not only subdues the 3D effect, but
introduces a noticeable amount of ghosting.  In fact, ghosting tends to be a real
problem with this disc at times, particularly in the edge of facial features and
even props such as swords.  In fact, being that ghosting was more prevalent
than normal I am wondering if this simply a result of this being one of the original
early 3D transfers like Monsters vs. Aliens which similarly suffered from an abnormal
amount of crosstalk.

Is there a credible amount of ""In Yo' Face"" 3D gimmickry here?  Not really.
Again, I use the word ""subtle"" to describe the overall effect.  Instead of objects
leaping towards the audience, they poke.  Things like fingers, chins, a hook on
the end of an arm and fire embers seem to nudge its way forward.  The flying
sequences -- particularly the battle at the film's close -- definitely looks more
enhanced with the amount of depth the 3D format provides.

Presented on this Blu-ray is a spectacular 7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack which
was downcoverted to 5.1 on my system.  I found myself completely absorbed
by this demo-quality soundscape that attacked the senses from every direction.
The film's dialogue sits squarely in the center channel, while subtle sounds of
the film's countryside emanate from the left and right channels.  The surrounds
seem to handle most of the work here, carrying the film's impressive array of
sound effects.  Everything is perfectly balanced so that one channel never
overpowers the other.  Sit yourself in the sweet spot of your home theater and be
prepared to be immersed in flyovers that move across channels and are accented
with a booming amount of LFE support.

How To Train Your Dragon arrives packaged as a Blu-ray 3D + DVD combo.
The only extras on the 3D disc is the film's trailer.  However, on the DVD disc
you get Special Features that include a look at the actors voicing the film's
characters; A look at the animation process with the animators themselves;
Filmmakers' Commentary.

How To Train Your Dragon ranks among the very best animated feature
films over the past few years, and is certainly a breath of freshness from
a studio that has been churning out mediocre animated product.

While the 3D is about average, it absolutely enhances the 2D experience
so I would not hesitate to recommend this as an upgrade to those who
already bought the standard Blu-ray release.

This is perhaps the most fun you and your family will spend together in
in front of your display, so don't hesitate to make that experience happen.

Great fun!",1453075200,2,5513,4.821466524973433
