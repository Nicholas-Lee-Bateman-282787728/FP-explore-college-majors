1818745,4,B00007L4KO,"Its been ten years since Officer Alex J Murphy was murdered and trnsformed into the metal frankenstien that is known as Robocop. Delta city has been a thriving city for many years now, and old detroit has been all but forgotten in the shadow. The film Dark justice continues the Robocop mythos to a great extent, and even throws in a bit of backstory to our favorite cop murphy. Although dark justice is rough around the edges, and obviously made for television, its a great start to an even better mini-series. Exciting fights, interesting characters, and Robo doing his thing, all great. Dark justice is more story than action, so don't expect the big bangs until the following three movies (meltdown, ressurection, and crash and burn). But there is so much to tell, I don't want to reviel all of the great twists. So if you are even slightly a fan of Robocops past films, or u have your own suit of Robo armor, this is a great buy!",1046044800,,934,4.5325443786982245
1818746,2,B00007L4KO,"Things in old Detroit, herein Delta City have seemingly gone from bad to worse since RoboCop's 1997 inception. OCP (Omni Consumer Products, the conglomerate that designed RoboCop), now owns Detroit and therefore feels compelled to turn it back over to the savages that RoboCop was once created and brought in to clean up. Of course, Robo's programmed priorities: 1) Serve the public trust; 2) Uphold the law; 3) Protect the innocent have now been slightly tampered with allowing for a confused man-machine to roam the streets of Motown on a 'mission' to kill someone he should be protecting. A new nemesis is introduced here in the form of `Bone Machine,' and even though he may not be as equipped as the man of steel, certainly puts up one hell of an unfair fight ! And, as usual, 'RoboCop: Dark Justice' is all-out war, with explosive street fights and power struggles that could destroy either the entire city or the evil powers behind the brutal corporate conglomeration. In other words, if you have no time for this drivel - or you were much happier (as I was) with original RoboCop Peter Weller behind the mask - then this is an evenings complete waste of time from start to end ! But, for what it is, and what it represents, this is a nice - albeit hackneyed attempt at a continuing RoboCop series - way to keep the spirit of Detroit `Rock City' alive ! ...",1044230400,,1364,4.594262295081967

1818762,1,B00007L4KO,It was ok but it was just a rehash of most of the plot elements from the original movie.,1470787200,,88,3.6842105263157894

1818764,4,B00007L4KO,"Confused at all the RoboCop titles you see on Amazon? Let's fix that. RoboCop: The Series is a 22-episode ,1994 Canadian television series based on the films, specifically, the series takes place between RoboCop 1 and 2. Richard Eden plays RoboCop in this version. Canada's Skyvision Entertainment paid $500,000 cash to Orion Pictures for TV licensing rights. The show is know for being made to appeal primarily to children and young teenagers, lacking the graphic violence that was the hallmark of the original film. The pilot episode is remembered for being adapted from a discarded RoboCop 2 script, Corporate Wars, by the writers of the original RoboCop, Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner.

It does seem a bit silly that Robocop has non-lethal ways of dispatching criminals at times, and even young teens that remember the original film will be upset at the kid-friendly aspect of the show. Its not a bad show, apparently being rather expensive to produce at the time (up to $1.5 million per episode), but its rather lackluster to watch nowadays.

RoboCop: Prime Directives, the 2001 Canadian TV, 4 episode miniseries. Page Fletcher plays RoboCop in this series. Fireworks Entertainment was about to have the RoboCop license expire so they rushed this miniseries into production. It consisted of four feature-length (95 min) episodes: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection, and Crash and Burn. You can find them all listed separately on Amazon, but you can still find them. I actually recommend RoboCop: Prime Directives, directed by Julian Grant. The family-friendly TV 1994 series held no interest to Grant, and he returned RoboCop to his dark and more violent roots. The Prime Directives series takes place ten years after the original film, and ignores all events from RoboCop 2 and 3. The director has stated that he did not do this because he didn't respect the other films, but rather to give him some room to craft his own story. It defiantly stands up better than the kid-friendly series, but it has been often criticized for its low-budget look (special effects, locations, action sequences, and so on). It defiantly has its own style to it, and though it was put together rather quickly, its not a bad series.

To see them in order, you need to watch (1) Dark Justice (2) Meltdown (3) Resurrection (4) then Crash and Burn.

Prime Directives premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel to lackluster ratings at the time. I still recommend it over the other live-action series, though collectors will want them both anyway. Lets just ignore the animated RoboCop series at the moment :)",1467849600,8,2606,4.997695852534562
1818765,4,B00007L4KO,"This isn't going to go down as a great piece of cinema, but probably as a cult classic. I love Robocop and I love the anti-corporate message that has run throughout all of the Robocop movies. Funny to be saying that on Amazon. Anyway, the weak parts here are some of the acting and some of the writing, but these movies are made in the spirit of the old Robocop movies, and Robocop fans in general should enjoy them.",1467763200,,416,4.2784810126582276

Robocop was decent in here, not as good as Peter Weller though.  It starts off fairly slow, but picks up the pace quickly.

1818832,1,B00007L4KO,"It's a multi-part television miniseries with a cumulative budget lower than just the first theatrical Robocop. The plot is a computer virus that can come out of your monitor and eat you. Robocop is a good 6 inches shorter than every other character. Everyone is related because DRAMA. There is a scene where robocop hides his identity in a market by wearing a huge cloak.

This movie stinks on ice is what I'm saying.",1328745600,3,417,4.635135135135135
1818833,3,B00007L4KO,"So I'm a big fan of just cheesy terrible movies - I love them for their badness. I'm also a fan of Robocop - i love him for his awesomeness. So, with the budget used, everyone thinks that they could do better. Probably so. Its poorly characterized and the guy playing robocop is easily the most terrible and mis-cast robo ever. But hey - It's still robocop, right? Easily the best of the ""Prime Directives"" movies. And the story of Murphy's lead-up to transferring and that fateful showdown that made him robocop IS kind of interesting and neat. But yeah - for the true ALL THINGS ROBOCOP kinda fan ... not for the purist or passive onlooker.",1314921600,,642,4.495726495726496
1818834,1,B00007L4KO,"Everything about this movie is a monstrosity.  The only thing that would even be considered as descent is the story line.  How does a machine/human have the ability to cry?  Unless there's an evolution in his organic parts that allow him to have human fluids, there is no sense at all.  Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop?  I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on.  The only true Robocop is Peter Weller w/ Paul Verhoeven and Irvin Kershner as the directors.  ALL OTHERS SUCK!",1278460800,2,574,4.461538461538462
1818835,5,B00007L4KO,"Given that Robocop is as popular as he is, it's no surprise that a quality miniseries like this was produced. Everything from the writing to
the character arcs is splendid. Understand that this is not Hollywood, so the effects are not what you'd see in a summer blockbuster.

If you understand what this series represents, then you are in a for a great treat! Fleshing out the character of Alex Murphy is one of the most highly
sought after things in the Robocop world, so you are in a for a wonderful and fulfilling ride!

All things considered, I give this 4 part series 5 stars, due to the fact that I would rather have these, than nothing at all. That statement does not
detract from the series at all. The acting, and writing is on par with the very finest movies and tv series ever produced. It's a shame that more
money could not have been spent for better fx, but in all honesty, it DOES NOT detract from the series at all. ALL fans of Robocop should be pleased
with the product you are presented with. There is no cheese.... the production was quality enough to keep this from having any cheese factor, as
you would expect from a series of this caliber. Extremely entertaining!

5 stars, a very strong recommendation.

5 stars for Robocop!!!",1274659200,,1250,4.493392070484582

This four part movie (Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection and Crash and Burn), shows the continued growth of the character Alex Murphy/RoboCop and his struggle to balance his current existence with the past life he knew. It has a lot fun action sequences and introduces new characters such as John Cable and James Murphy. Take a look its a lot of fun.",1270166400,,475,4.666666666666667
1818847,5,B00007L4KO,"This is a definite must for any real RoboCop fan though I would not suggest it to someone not already familiar with the three movies as it uses lots of little flashback sequences.

There are a total of 4 made for TV movies by Lions Gates that are a bit on the cheesy side by today's standards but definitely worth a view for fans.

What else is there to say, I definitely thought this and it three companion movies were well worth the purchase.",1246233600,,444,4.273809523809524
1818848,2,B00007L4KO,"This has how many dvds this series? Four? And they're charging thirteen dollars a DVD to watch eight hours?

Be realistic. I'd buy it if it was all four together for thirteen dollars. The movie isn't what it was before. They made Robocop weaker than his TV debut.

And they are going to charge us seventy dollars (including the shipping and handling of course) to buy four lame eight hour movies to watch maybe two or three times. DVD Rentals where are you? Nobody is going to pay that much for eight hours of a dull run.",1190246400,,521,4.360824742268041
1818849,4,B00007L4KO,"Robocop: Dark Justice

Ever since I picked up the trilogy for a whopping $15 I have since became a major fan. Not so much for the decent action, not so much for the surreal satire which is often humorous, but for the man beneath the iron.

Page Fletcher (of Hitchhiker fame) takes over this role and makes it as outstanding as Peter Weller. Though he doesn't have the walk down perfectly, he does talk the talk. Most of the other actors are quite good, the story is actually interesting, and the while the effects are no where near the consistant quality of the feature films I was surprised at how good they are! Despite the sometimes sagging effects of this Canadian mini-series (Robo's suit and walking effect are a bit lame) I must say this does for the small screen practically what the first movie did for the large screen, and that for me says a lot.

This first disc has a LOT of heart and strikes a chord with me when dealing with humanity. I have since ordered the other three and am looking forward to completing the story which obviously picks up on the next installment. A definite buy for any RoboCop fan that loves the humanity more than the explosions.",1164153600,,1168,4.474178403755869
1818850,3,B00007L4KO,"Supposedly RoboCop Prime Directives was originally a TV miniseries released in 2001. I'm not sure where it aired, but each episode is feature film length and the violence/language varies from PG to R rated material.

The series includes Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection, and Crash and Burn...and the movies should be watched in that order for them to make sense.

Page Fletcher (from HBO's The Hitchhiker) stars as RoboCop. He does about as good a job as Robert John Burke did in RoboCop 3. In fact, the whole Prime Directives series is on par with RoboCop 3...and that's not a compliment. It's not really a knock either. It's a declaration that Prime Directives is an average sequel-set to what were two great initial RoboCop films (RoboCop and RoboCop 2).

Prime Directives takes place ten years after the first RoboCop. Alex Murphy/RoboCop is no longer needed in Delta City and is now considered a nuisance by OCP. John Cable, Alex Murphy's former partner, is killed and brought back as a new RoboCop and is instructed to destroy Murphy/RoboCop.

OCP is now in the hands of corrupt executives (one is a malevolent new CEO, one is Cable/RoboCop's ex-wife and one is Murphy/RoboCop's own son) and they have a new technology called SAINT that they will use to run the city and market to consumers ""to make all of your decisions for you"". But there is a terrorist that wants to infect SAINT with a computer virus that could take down all computers on the net and release a deadly nanotechlogy into humans.

All 4 episodes run apx 90 minutes each, so we're talking about 6 hours of 3-star RoboCop. So if you've got a rainy day and a craving for RoboCop, this series is for you.

As of this writing, the series is available as a set only from Amazon resellers, and the set is about 1/2 the price of buying all 4 separately. But Prime Directives is far from collector caliber, so I'd recommend just finding these to rent, and keep the viewing order that I mentioned earlier in mind.",1156723200,,1982,4.681034482758621
1818851,4,B00007L4KO,"These four movies are like a TV miniseries, so they aren't as good as a movie with a big production budget might be. Still, they're pretty good, and if you're a sci-fi or Robocop fan it's certainly worth the time and money to watch them. It doesn't say on the box what order to watch them in, so here it is: Dark Justice, Meldown, Resurrection, Crash & Burn.",1134086400,20,358,4.279411764705882
1818852,4,B00007L4KO,"I did not even know these new Robocop movies had been made. I take it they where T.V movies or something? However the big reason that they do not have part 4, 5, 6, or 7 on them is because it would have to be called Robocop 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4. These are a 4 part series all spanning over into the continuity of each other. I saw these DVD's for sale individualy on the shelf at very cheap prices, but I thought they where the TV series that was made a few years ago. They are not. These are 2001 made movies, each running for about an hour and twenty minutes and all continue the story into each other. But I never watched these untill I rented all 4 in one. Amazon don't show anything like it, but here in Australia it is titled as ACTION PACK 2, and is 2 DVD's with 2 double sided discs in each. The last one is the four Robocop series movies. On 2 flip sided discs.

The lowdown on the adventure is that it's ten years since robocop was made. He has been serving the public trust, protecting the innocent, and in some ways upholding the law. There are all new crime bosses in Delta City. And OCP as as in charge and as corrupted as ever.

Robo has a new cheif John Cableat the station who was Robo's partner when he was alive as Alex Murphy. Throguhout the first episode Robo is having memory flash backs of John, and eventualy John discovers who it is underneath the titanium armour known as Robocop. Eventualy John Cable is shot dead in the line of duty but reserected as the new and improved version as Robocop, but corrupted by an OCP executive, his first mission, while being unknown to anybody yet, is to frame Robocop by attacking the head of OCP and various other things. Robocop is then disgraced as a fugitive and hunted down to be taken off the streets. OCP send out Cable and introduce the public to the new and improved Robocop unit. Robocop tries to make Cable remember who he is. Will Robo make him remember or not? Eventualy another of OCP's executives gets his plan to make every hom ein Delta City run by the one mega computer operating in the OCP biulding will let nothing get in the way of his dream, even if it means murder. Eventualy when the machine is about to go online and take over everything in the city, a bad guy attempts to upload a virus on the computer that will spread to all computers, and then to humans!! Will Robocop be able to defeat the new and improved Robocop unit with his friend John Cable inside? Will Robo be able to do something about the new computer virus while being hunted down as a fugitive by OCP and Cable? Find out by watching, it might suprise you what happens in the end.

Overall I thought the whole thing was very interesting. Lots of comedy and fun and action, I thought some parts where pretty lame and boring. Some things I did not like, I hated the way Robocop sounded when he walked, being so used to the sound he is supposed to have, the new one did not work for me. There is no sign of an ED-209 anywhere in sight. During a grave sight scene, it shows Alex Murphy as having died in 1992, obviously they never bothered to work out what year Robocop (original) was supposed to be set in.

Apart from that the whole thing is pretty enjoyable. You'll have to own all 4 DVD's to enjoy the whole story line. Other wise it is just movies that don't make sense. Robocop's ultimiate challenge is another Robocop, new and improved and the man is also one of Alex Murphys best friends. So join Robo on an adventure through Delta City and see what happens if your interested.

This R1 release is issued in Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) with English Dolby 2.0 Surround.  Surprisingly it's a good strong surround mix.  Dialogue, despite some negetive reviews of the broadcase version, is strong and easily understandable.
The R2 release however appears to be in Dolby 5.1, which is ashame because the R1 could have benefitted from a 5.1 mix.  But anyway...
Picture quality?  Pretty good for a TV show.  The only issue is with out-of-focus background lights.  They have that digital compression ""dot crawl"".  But other than that, all live action and special f/x look extremely sharp and clear.
Just recently bought this series in geer up for the new release of the Robocop Trilogy.  Now, I'd like to see the mid-'90s Robocop series released on DVD.  The only thing lacking in this series is the lack of use of Robo's automated targeting grid system.

Yea the character of Done Machine looks corny as heck, but his persona makes more since than some of the guys I could name and he doesn't play too big of a role anyway.  This is a good made for TV movie that doesn't work if you compare it to three orginal movies.  Just remember this is a part one of four movie so its a step up movie.  This one is three stars for a made for TV movie and the rest of the mini-series can go from 4 to 5.  I just hope they come out quicker than this one did.

7977697,3,B00007L4KO,The series is long and boring. Most of the time it is boring and Robocop not doing much. Robocop is also shorter than in the movies. I noticed this right away. It kind of ruined the movie for me. You can tell they spent most of the movie budget on the RoboCop suites. I liked the backstory on Murphy.,1511740800,,300,4.101694915254237

It's TV origins really shows, with the special effects, acting, and continuity being trimmed to fit the small screen.  However, the only major flaw is pacing.  It is heavily padded, with scenes lasting much longer than necessary.  It's a solid hour of show stretched out to ninety minutes.",1508630400,,350,4.783333333333333

I made it about half way through then shut it off because I could not take any more.
