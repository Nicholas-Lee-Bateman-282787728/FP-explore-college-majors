8455037,3,B00537AXH0,This yoga was waaaaaaaay too hard for me. I thought it was going to be a beginner thing that you can slowly work into. Boy was I wrong. I had to turn it off after 5 minutes because I couldn't do any of the moves. I found better stuff on YouTube.,1490745600,,245,3.823529411764706
8455038,5,B00537AXH0,I have ordered another one. I use several times per week. I think Baron offering several different ways to do the poses helps a lot.,1436400000,2,132,4.32
8455039,4,B00537AXH0,"Baptiste has a nice, gentle way of relating to the students in his ""class"" as well as to watchers.  My one quibble, which is actually fairly serious, is that the constant use of down dog and plank poses made my wrists tired and sore, and I bet that would happen to a lot of people.  How does that help with MS?
This did work for me in that it didn't feature too much back bending or twisting, both of which I enjoy, but spinal surgery made them impossible, so this is a workout I can use without too much modification.",1406937600,2,518,4.17
