6068227,5,B00G9YZ718,The history of an event is always interesting.  You'd never believe how they get started.  This is a great documentary.,1391644800,5,119,4.9
6068228,5,B00G9YZ718,"The directorial debut of acclaimed actress S. Epatha Merkerson tackles a slice of American history not exposed before. Exploring the contradiction of The Fair Hope Benevolent Society (what it was originally and what it is now), the film tells of story of slavery in a unique fashion that will definitely be a surprise to viewers. It traces the developments, struggles, contributions and gradual loss of traditions of one of the last remaining African American benevolent societies and it contrasts deity and the devil, preaching and prostitution, gospel and guns, devotion and drugs and heaven and hell.",1388966400,10,603,5.291666666666667

6068230,5,B00G9YZ718,The documentary is important as it provides the history behind benevolent societies. The film shows what happens when parents and elders do not teach their children about their history and why specific groups and events exist.,1412121600,,226,5.305555555555555

6068233,5,B00G9YZ718,"Excellent documentary. I loved the coverage of this society throughout the years. I had not heard of the Fair Hope Benevolent Society and admired their
 original purpose. It's cool that they have continued on with their primary purpose which contradicts with the yearly ""near orgy"" that is in their name.",1398384000,3,304,5.08

6068236,4,B00G9YZ718,Very informative documentary. I never heard about foot and the story of the free slaves and their children. I can re-watch it,1394409600,,125,4.7272727272727275
6068237,5,B00G9YZ718,This untold story in African American history was an excellent adult documentary moving from a powerful historic past to the present.,1394064000,7,133,5.380952380952381
6068238,5,B00G9YZ718,"I strongly urge every African American civic as well as private institution to obtain copies of this documentary for use as an educational tool. The entrenched establishment cannot nor will not permit this type of information to be made available to the nations youth so that they will understand the psychological reasons behind much of their social behaviors. Popular black ""reality"" television programs are merely mirror images of the ""Foot Wash"" carnival in Alabama. Purchase this DVD and turn your living rooms into mini theaters as soon as possible!",1392595200,11,555,5.247191011235955

8621524,4,B00G9YZ718,"I was surprised that I had not heard of this documentary but was glad that I saw it, yet in the end was sad.  In my opinion, this documentary somewhat sums up the connection between civil rights movement and its 21st century descendants.  African Americans have made great strides as a result but as with the characters in this documentary, future generations were left to their own devices and there appears at times to be no link to the past.  The elder descendants of the Society were clueless and stuck in a time long ago and those who changed the name to ""Foot Wash"" are delusional of the past and pawns in a capitalistic society.  This documentary should be a must see for both generations.  It might generate dialogue that would be helpful to both.",1427673600,,755,4.562962962962963
