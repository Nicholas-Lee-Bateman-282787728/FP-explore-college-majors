7844507,3,6303363474,It was o.k. The storyline was more for a child I think than an adult.  It unusual and the pets sure are cute,1441152000,,108,3.6956521739130435

7844509,5,6303363474,"If you're an adult, you will probably find this movie pretty bad.  But if you're kid you probably will enjoy its cast of younguns and the silly things that go on.  After all you get:
*A Brooklyn family relocated in the Witness Protection Program to a town called Cactus Flats, Arizona, population 1985.
*Two aliens who take on the form of country western singers, buy out a pet shop and bring along four cute little aliens which can transform into ordinary pets..object:  take back four human kids in their place.
*Two bumbling beefcakes posing as mafia hitman who are very stupid but not funny.
*Terry Kiser as the dad Brooklyn accent and all.
*A wife who remodels their home to look like the Ponderosa, replete with a Manhattan skyline on their garage door.
*Four darling little kids who have not gone on to bigger and better roles.
*Cheap special effects straight out of H.R. Pufnstuf.
And more of the same.
Kids will love it--that's why I gave it five stars.
Adults, be warned:  it's not one of those movies you can love along with the kids!!",1080432000,5,1046,4.60752688172043
