8196929,5,B000QQHGZ0,"X Division Xscape Match thing
Chris Sabin vs Black Machismo Jay Lethal vs Alex Shelley vs Shark Boy vs Sonjay Dutt
Being an X Division match, there was really little else you could expect but great wrestling and high spots.  Sabin and Shelley worked together most of the match, clear evidence of the impending Motor City Machine Guns.  (8/10)

Petey Williams vs Robert Roode
Involving a storyline which people could actually care about, in which Eric Young signs his contract to Robert Roode and becomes his work slave.  Here, Williams is fighting for Eric Young for some reason, which won't do anything since Young will still be Roode's biotch, but it was mildly entertaining on its own.  (6/10)

Gail Kim vs Jackie Moore
This is billed as the first ever women's cage match in TNA, and a sign in the audience really pushed my ""ANGRY"" button, that said ""Women shouldn't wrestle because they CAN'T"" and it infuriated me...  All throughout the match, I couldn't stop thinking of it, and I wished desperately that Gail and Jackie would prove that stupid sign wrong by putting on a good wrestling match.  But they didn't.  It wasn't as horrible as a typical WWE Divas match, but it came very close.  The high spot at the end was a very weak ""fall"" from the cage in which Gail completely missed Jackie, though did clip her head just barely with a crossbody.  Total failure there, and totally overhyped by the commentators.  (3/10)

Senshi vs Austin Starr
Indeed I believe Bob Backlund was a major distraction from this match early on.  Then he started not being a distraction, and let these two shine.  But they didn't shine.  They put on an average brawl that was heavily restrained, like something you'd have seen on the average episode of WWE Smackdown.  Considering what sort of matches Low Ki (Senshi) has put on in Ring of Honor and TNA, this was a total disappointment.  (4/10)

Blindfold Match
Chris Harris vs James Storm
Note to anyone anywhere at any time: Blindfold matches are NEVER entertaining.  They are ALWAYS a waste of time, a waste of talent, and a waste of crowd heat.  The crowd was totally heatless here, and they were pretty much just making noise for the hell of it, which the commentators played off as them trying to ""guide"" Chris Harris around to find James Storm.  Whenever a blindfold accidentally came off, people cheered, and whenever the referee put it back on, people booed LOUDLY.  Considering that these two were built up for a feud based around eye injury (HINT HINT: SHAWN MICHAELS VS CHRIS JERICHO 2008?) between two old friends, they blew this off horribly.  (0/10)

Jerry Lynn vs Christopher Daniels
This one also had a feel of being restrained, as if for an average TV episode of WWE.  But they at least did a lot better than Senshi and Austin Starr.  (8/10)

Electrified Cage Match NWA Tag Team Championship
Team 3D vs Latin American Xchange (C)
Note to anyone anywhere at anytime: Any match involving electricity and shocking people is inherently A VERY VERY BAD IDEA.  I was expecting colossal failure from the start, but a miracle happened: Team 3D and LAX put on a match of the year-potential match.  It was absolutely amazing, with the absolute best of the Dudley Boys/3D on display in a way I'd never seen in their later years in the WWE, and even had a genuinely exciting point in which Hector Guerrero comes from the Spanish commentary table and stops Konnan from tossing a steel chair to LAX, and then sends Brother Ray a table from under the ring.

Indeed the electrified parts were cringe-worthy in their stupidity, and every time it happened, people booed LOUDLY.  One of my favorite chants in TNA, ""Fire Russo"" happened, but really they should've reserved that for the Blindfold match, because this match was a damn spectacle.  Amazing spot goes to Hernandez, who jumps from the top of the cage through a table as Devon rolls off of it.  (10/10)

Lethal Lockdown
Team Cage: Christian Cage, AJ Styles, Tomko, Abyss, Scott Steiner vs Team Angle: Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Rhino, Sting, Jeff Jarrett
For some reason I always feel like the Lethal Lockdown match is going to be a horrible clusterschmazz of a bad gimmick match with lazy wrestling, and yet that's never been the case thus far.  This one went above and beyond everything I'd seen before and seen for the night.  Virtually anything and everything TNA has or had was on display here, as we got high spots (including a classic pyramid drop thing in which three people fought on the cage, and two others backdropped all of them into the ring, AJ Styles keeling over off the top of the cage onto three or four other wrestlers), serious technical wrestling, hardcore use of weapons (including a guitar filled with thumbtacks), psychology (would Jeff Jarrett betray his teammates?), power wrestling (Abyss, Tomko, Steiner, Rhino), and a justification of a waste of space (Steiner's first use of the Frankensteiner in many years).  Simply phenomenal.  (10/10)",1222387200,,4958,4.774647887323944
8196930,4,B000QQHGZ0,"Xcape Match: X Division Champion Chris Sabin vs. Jay Lethal vs. Shark Boy vs. Alex Shelley vs. Sonjay Dutt - For the record, this was around when Lethal started doing the ""Black Machismo"" gimmick.  This match had your X division fased paced action along with some good comedic spots involving Shark Boy and the seeds being planted for the future ""Motor City Machine Guns"" as Shelley & Sabin did some good double teaming throughout the bout as well.  Everyone here had a strong performance leading to a fun match to watch.

Petey Williams vs. Robert Roode - The battle of the former Captain & Enforcer of Team Canada over their ex-teammate in Eric Young & their Team Canada past was revisited here as even the old hockey stick & Petey's ""Oh Canada"" groining stand came into play thoughout the match.  This was a watchable encounter but I'll give it credit as one of Roode's best performances since the days after Team Canada.

Gail Kim vs. Jackie Moore - Wow, better encounter than expected as they delivered a solid match up from beginning to end with them brawling in & out the cage and the ending with Gail flying off the top of the cage onto Jackie is a highlight reel since you don't see that from females in the business today.  Good solid womens match that came off as intense most of the time.

Senshi vs. Austin Starr with Bob Backlund as the special referee - This is one of those X division matches that focused more on mat wrestling than the high flyin' and resulted in another solid match with Bob Backlund not taking away from the action in the ring.

Blindfold Match: Chris Harris vs. James Storm - What can be said about this match that hasn't already been said...it was horrible.  They build this fued up for these two to kill each other inside the six sides of steel...the cage match they made famous.  However, we get a match with a bunch of stalling & logic that didn't make sense in a blindfold match...and that's not even including the blindfold's falling off thoughout the match.  Unless you enjoy the crowd crapping all over a match, these is where you would press the skip button.

Jerry Lynn vs. Christopher Daniels - This is a different type of match than you would normally expect from them.  It was solid from start to finish but it wasn't a show stealing performance that you would normally get.

Electrified Cage Match: NWA Tag Team Champions LAX vs. Team 3D - This match was setup to disappoint from the start as they had darkened the whole arena & shined a light strickly on the ring and had the wrestlers act (or overact) like they were heavily shocked which just looked bad & killed any momentum the match would have gained.  The match was as good as their pervious brawls but the gimmick hurt more than helped in this match.

Lethal Lockdown: Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett, Rhino, Samoa Joe, Sting vs. Christian Cage, AJ Styles, Tomko, Abyss, Scott Steiner - These Lethal Lockdown matches get better each year with this one being the best one yet as it told multiple stories thoughout the match along with memorable moments that topped the previous years.  One funny moment to watch for it Jarrett's entrance where the pyro completely destroys his gutiar before he even walks down the ramp.  Other memorable moments include Scott Steiner breaking out the Frankensteiner for the first time in a long time, Kurt Angle throwing AJ Styles off the top of the cage onto other wrestlers on the floor, Rhino goring Tomko out of the cage to the floor, Cage's double chokeslam onto tacks, Abyss getting hit in the head with a gutiar full of thumbtacks, the unfolding of the ""can you trust Jarrett"" angle, and for the old school fans...Harley Race (the gatekeeper at ringside) knocking out Jim Mitchell.  Awesome main event.

In the end, this PPV perfectly showcased what's been going on with TNA since the new creative team came into effect in late '06.  The wrestling is there & the talents deliever great performances thoughout the card.  However, it's the over the top gimmicks & booking that's damaging the product as the Electric Cage & Blindfold match showcased.  Overall, this is the one TNA event on DVD from 2007 that I highly recommend for anyone.",1191888000,2,4177,4.645380434782608

1. Chris Sabin vs. Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Alex Shelly vs. Shark Boy in a XSCAPE Match For the X-Division Title- This was a great way to kick off the show. TNA always says that the X-Division invented them and this showed that here. Lots of near falls and fast pace action made for a good match. Winner and still X-Division Champ Chris Sabin. Match Rating 8.5/10.
2. Petey Williams vs. Robert Roode with Mrs. Brooks in a Grudge Match- This was an okay match. Coming into this these two had a good feud going. Williams looked on top of his game today while Roode can still improve. Just a decent wrestling match. Not much to say. Winner Robert Roode. Match Rating 6/10.
3. Gail Kim vs. Jackie Moore in a Catfight in a cage match- Well I did not know what to think of this match but it turned out to be really good. One thing I will say is these 2 had a great feud going into this and I have no idea why the wwe let Gail Kim go as she has so much talent. Jackie has some good power moves and with Gail's speed they made a great match. Also a great cross body off the top of the six sides of steel made this match great. Winner Gail Kim. Match Rating 6.5/10.
4. Senshi vs. Austin Starr Special Referee Mr. Backlund- Well this was another solid match. It involved a lot of fast pace moves and some high flying action. Preatty good X-division match. Winner Senshi. Match Rating 7/10.
5. Chris Harris vs. James Storm in a Blindfold Match- This match I just don't understand. These two had a great feud going into this match but the horrible booking of TNA ruined the match. This was a complete waste of 15 minutes and even the crowd started chanting boring and fire russo. Skip this match. Winner James Storm. Match Rating 1.5/10.
6. Christopher Daniels vs. Jerry Lynn- Well here we go with something better. Two great X-Division wrestlers even Lynn at his age showed he can put on a good show. This was just a solid wrestling match with a whole new side of Daniels. Winner Christopher Daniels. Match Rating 7/10.
7. LAX vs. Team 3D for the World Tag Team Titles in a Electrified Cage Match- Well I have to admit as bad as this match seemed like it would be before it started it actually turned out to be really good. In all honesty this was a great tag team match except for the electrified cage part. Some great tag team wrestling and a very bloody match. The best part of the match was Hernandez tried a splash from the top of the cage but missed and crashed through the table. Winners and new TNA Tag Team Champs Team 3D. Match Rating 8/10.
8. Kurt Angle, Sting, Samoa Joe, Rhino, and Jeff Jarrett vs. Christian Cage, A.J. Styles, Scott Steiner, Abyss and Tomko in a Lethal Lockdown Match- Well this is what saved the event as it made up for that bad match and gave us a great one. There were so many great parts in this match including a Frankinstinner (Hurricanrana) from the top rope by Scott Steiner yes that's right Scott Steiner. The first part of the match was good but when the weapons came into play it picked up. We saw some great hardcore action and some sick spots. A great main event. Winner Team Angle. Match Rating 10/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give TNA LOCKDOWN 2007 a grade of 54.5/80 which is a 68% which means this is a good ppv. This is a good ppv and would have scored a lot better if it was not for the blindfold match but you should pick this up on DVD. For only 15 dollars its worth it. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1186704000,2,3593,4.30576070901034

Xscape X division title match
Chris Sabin vs. Jay Lethal vs. Shark Boy vs. Alex Shelly vs. Son jay Dutt

It starts out pretty good. Sabin and Shelly perform a lot of good double teams. Even Shark Boy does some good moves for a while. They all did a outstanding job to open lockdown and they couldn't of done it better. Rating 8/10

Robert Rhoode vs. Petey Williams

The hole save Eric Young thing was okay but it starts to get old. Anyway, the match was okay. Any time Petey tries to do something Rhoode over powers him. There was some botched moves but they picked it up and they pulled it together. Eric tried to help Petey but it didn't help that much. Rating 6/10

Gail Kim vs. Jackie Moore

You know, I didn't like this match. They had some slow moves at a time and it got real boring for me. They had some brawling and some high flying moves. I also liked the ending but that's pretty much it for me. Rating 5/10

Austin Starr vs. Senshi special referee Mr. Backlund

This was a pretty good match. Austin was getting really mad at Backlund for not making those counts. There was a perfect 450 splash by Austin and some other good moves done by both men. The ending when Backlund pushed Austin was sorry and that pulled down the rating. Rating 7/10

Blind Fold match
James Storm vs. Chris Harris

Let me just say this, anyone who wants to watch this match should just skip it. It isn't worth it. It starts at like any other blind fold match, feeling around. What really hurt was that there masks kept on falling off. I just kept on getting madder and madder. It looked like they tried they're best but it wasn't. Rating 1/10

Jerry Lynn vs. Christopher Daniels

I liked this match very much. There was an impressive ddt done by Lynn and I was liked wowed. Daniels does some good counters thru out the match. It looked like it was going to end here and there and that was also that made it good. There was also some big moves done by both men and I was surprised by that. Lynn and Daniels put on a good match. Rating 7/10

Tag Team championship ""Electrified"" Cage match
LAX vs. Team 3D

Oh-boy Oh-boy. I was ""electrified"". The commentators really played off that they got killed or something. The hole getting ""electrified"" was so stupid, corny, but also quite funny. They pulled off some good brawling, power moves, and a table spot but that was it. All these people took this too seriously and that took it down, all the way down. Rating 4/10

Lethal Lockdown match
Team Angle vs. Team Cage

Wow. Yeah, that's what I think. It starts out with 2 men for 5 minutes then every 2 minutes someone comes out. I was outstand by Scott Steiner doing that Franken Steiner. I didn't even know he could do that. There were some nice spots with the chair, trash can lid, guitar, and thumbtacks.. I didn't really know who would win and got really got good. I think there should have been more weapons but didn't take away the quality of the match. Rating 9/10

Overall this was a very good ppv. Some nice matches and a terrific main event. I do recommended this DVD and also others like wwe ladder match and when it comes out Slammiversary.",1186185600,,3154,4.373287671232877

8196934,4,B000QQHGZ0,"TNA Lockdown 2007 is a very underrated PPV. It has been panned by many wrestling fans and reviewers based on the fact that there were 2 underwhelming matches on the card.

Much like 1 or 2 great matches do not make a PPV as a whole great, 1 or 2 bad matches do not make a PPV as a whole bad.

Lets take a look at the card:

X Division Championship- Xcape Match
This was a great opener with Sabin retaining the X Title against 5 other X Division stars. It got the show off to a hot start, and got the crowd warmed up, exactly what openers are meant to do.
7/10

Robert Roode def Petey Williams
This match was nothing special, but it had decent pacing and good wrestling.
6/10

Gail Kim def Jackie Moore
This was a chance for TNA to show the world that they could deliver with Womens wrestling. This certainly wasn't as good as a Mickie James, Lita, or Trish match, but it was very intense and had a nice ending spot with Kim jumping from the cage onto Moore.
6/10

Senshi def Austin Starr (Bob Backlund was the Special Guest Referee)
Really nice match here and a good rematch to their previous encounters. I would've liked to see this match get a bit more time though.
7/10

James Storm def Chris Harris- Blindfold Match
This is one of the 2 matches that gave this PPV a bad wrap. It certainly wasn't the fault of these two great talents; however, it was the gimmick of the match that limited what they could have done in the ring (and would go on to do at the next PPV). Really boring and pointless match after months of build.
2/10

Christopher Daniels def Jerry Lynn
Thankfully this match picked up the pieces from the stinker before it. Although a bit slow at times, it definitly picked up toward the end and statisfied the audience.
6/10

NWA Tag Team Championship- Electrified Cage Match- Team 3D def LAX
This would be the 2nd match that was mentioned before as a stinker. Again, the gimmick here is what held them back. No one was fooled by the so-called ""electricity"" shocking the wrestlers as they hit the cage. It came off very ackward and ended up giving the entire event as a whole a bad name. If they would've done a straight up Tag Team Steel Cage match it would've come off a lot better as there were some really nice spots throughout the match. However, the stupid gimmick worked against the quality of the match.
5/10

Lethal Lockdown Main Event Match
Awesome, near 30-minute match that ended the PPV on a good note. No one will forget the return of the Frankensteiner as Scott Steiner showed the viewers that he still had it in him, nor will they forget AJ Styles' incredible fall off of the cage. Truely memorable and definitly ranks up there with the old school War Games matches.
