8210315,3,B000TQ2Q8Y,This was just okay--not as good as I expected based on a recommendation.,1453680000,,72,4.615384615384615
8210316,5,B000TQ2Q8Y,Great dvd,1444262400,,9,4.0
8210317,5,B000TQ2Q8Y,Just what I was looking for. We had one that the babies had watched so many times that we needed new shows. I believe this one was even better.,1402012800,,143,3.9655172413793105
8210318,5,B000TQ2Q8Y,"Let's be honest, I HATE this DVD, but my 2-year-old son still loves it.  The cartoons are short, averaging 5 minutes, and hold those short attention spans well.  Having it on repeat for the entire weekend sucks, but sometimes you gotta grin and bear it.  Wow, that was lame.",1377648000,,274,4.551020408163265
8210319,4,B000TQ2Q8Y,DVD in great condition but the title ordered and the DVD didn't match. However the one received was enjoyed anyway.,1311811200,,115,4.8
8210320,1,B000TQ2Q8Y,"The episodes of the dvd are not what is listed on the jacket. The cover of the dvd  and the picture on the dvd are what I ordered ""Little Brown Bear Gets Up Early"". However, when the dvd plays it is ""Little Brown Bear Loves Picnics"". Which I already have and my granddaughter loves. I purchased ""Gets Up Early"" new. I believe it to be a manufacturing defect and have tried twice to speak to a ""live"" person at Digiview Entertainment. No one has returned my calls. I had previously ordered a used dvd of the same title with the same results. I had hoped it was the used one only with the problem, but alas, the new one also had the same problem. Therefore concluding it to be a manufacturing problem.",1239580800,,699,4.295454545454546
