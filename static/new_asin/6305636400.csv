... in which there were no dead people to call zombies other than in the first 5 minutes of the film.  After that ... zilch.  nada.  not a zombie to be seen.

Rather, folks were hypnotized with Bela Lugosi's eyes super-imposed on the film *which, by the way, Mr. Lugosi received no screen credit for*.  Once un-hypnotized, they're pissed-off and make lots of noise while generally running amuck and creating havoc before killing their 'creator', Armond.

Come to think of it, I don't even think those Asian guys in the beginning were dead either.  They just inhaled the magic smoke that the buddhist monk, who somehow found his way to the Franco-Austrain border, puffed their way sometime before the film began and they were hypnotized.  I'm quite sure I've tried some of that stuff before ... sans the buddhist monk.  Perhaps it was called ""Buddhist Monk"" because of its calming, zen-like quality ... but I digress ...

This movie had a shot of being so incredibly awesome.  It began with the Forward:

""Many strange events were recorded in the secret archives of the fighting nations during the world war.
But none stranger than that which occurred when a regiment of French Cambodians from the vicinity of the lost city of Angkor arrived on the Franco-Austrian front.""

Did you catch that?  ""during the *world war*'"".  It didn't specify which world war because this movie was made in 1936 and there had been no 2nd world war yet.  Awesome place in history!

All that aside, this flick should have been called ""Revolt of the ex-Zombies that Never Really Were"" since they never died and they were un-hypnotized before the revolt.

O ... and one more thing that I didn't like, this was really just a disguised love story gone wrong ... heavy on the love story and nothing left over for classic horror.

And well ... I'm not into love stories so ... thanks ... but no thanks.  :/",1354924800,,1910,4.678678678678678
7892344,4,6305636400,This Roan release has an excellent print of King of the Zombies which makes it great to watch.  Revolt of the Zombies is fun and the only downside is approx. 15 seconds of dialogue missing from one scene.  This scene is complete in other prints I've seen.  It could of easily been corrected by using another print.  This release shows the good and bad of Roan.,1298073600,,360,4.409090909090909
7892345,4,6305636400,"The King of Zombies - This movie is really funny. I don't know if it was intended to be funny, but the movie is hilarious. Mantan Moreland, the man playing the African American valet or male servant, is so funny. The movie is a great laugh and I highly reccommend it. Gotta love the quotes in this movie! In one scene Moreland, thinking he is a zombie, tells the other zombies ""Move over boys, I'm one of the gang now"". He then proceeds to lead the ""Zombie Squad"" to the kitchen. Good and funny.",1197417600,,495,4.276595744680851
7892346,3,6305636400,"""King of the Zombies"" is a 1941 zombie comedy from director Jean Yarborough set during World War II.  James ""Mac"" McCarthy (Dick Purcell), his servant Jefferson ""Jeff"" Jackson (Mantan Moreland) and his pilot Bill Summers (John Archer) are in a small plane that gets blown off course.  Picking up a radio signal they crash on an unknown island (there is no money for special effects so the three throw up their arms in front of their faces before a quick fade out to represent the crash).  There they are welcome in an appropriately strange manner by Dr. Mikhail Sangre (Henry Victor).  Making things even stranger is Momba (Leigh Whipper), the butler, Samantha (Marguerite Whitten), the maid, and Tahama (Madame Sul-Te-Wan), who is not only Sangre's cook but the local High Priestess.

Yes, there are zombies walking around in this one, but Dr. Sangre is also into hypnotism and one of the strangest mad scientist experiments for getting secret information from a person you have ever seen in a B-movie.  You see, it turns out there is also a missing admiral, a damsel who may be in distress, and strict rules about how much salt a zombie can have in their diet.  As others have noted, the best part of this movie is Mantan Moreland, who walks a fine line as the comedy relief in this movie.  Granted, he is conforming to the stereotype of the black servant, but he manages to avoid playing his fright an anything close to a Stepin' Fetchit caricature.  If only the white characters would listen to him they would not have problems like having a pistol full of bullets pumped into their bodies while walking around like zombies.

Believe it or not, ""King of the Zombies"" received an Academy Award nomination for Edward J. Kay for Best Musical Score of a Dramatic Picture (there were 20 film scores nominated that year, including the ones for ""Citizen Kane,"" ""How Green Was My Valley,"" ""Suspicion,"" and ""Sergeant York,"" with Bernard Hermann winning for ""The Devil and Daniel Webster""). Bela Lugosi was apparently supposed to play Dr. Sangre, but that would have been a minimal improvement and really would have worked against Moreland's comedy.

""Revolt of the Zombies"" is a 1936 film from director Victor Halperin (who made ""White Zombie"" four years earlier) that actually is set during World War I when a priest (Teru Shimada) from French Cambodia insists his god requires him to raise a zombie army to fight the Germans in the trenches.  The allied generals are impressed by the idea and want the secret of creating zombies but the priest refuses to share it and is murdered shortly after being imprisoned.  So an expedition is sent to the fabled lost city of Angkor to find the secret, but the problem is that a love triangle breaks out between Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland), his fianc Claire Duval (Dorothy Stone), and Armand Loque (Dean Jagger, young and with hair!).  As the odd man out, Armond discovers the secret and instead of using it to stop the Huns from overrunning his homeland raises the zombies to make Claire his own.

There is lot of scenes where actors walk in front of footage of Angkor and other exotic actions, but mostly there is a lot of talking in this one and giant zombie eyes superimposed over the action.  But the real problem with ""Revolt of the Zombies"" is that it has this great idea of using zombie soldiers in war that gets forgotten once the love triangle becomes more important than the expedition, so you feel like you took a wrong turn someplace in this one.  Then again, the whole idea that zombies are from Cambodia, where the Aspara figures, the heavenly dancers of Hindu mythology at Angkor Wat, are turned in zombies, is a step in the wrong direction.  There is also some cloak and dagger nonsense that only complicates the increasingly bad situation.

In terms of double-features movies for Saturday night viewing this one is really bare boned. You get the movies, one on each side of the DVD, and frames for the cast, filmmakers, and a couple of paragraphs on the history of the film from an actual film scholar.  Of these two bad movies ""King of the Zombies"" is a shade better, but in the end neither of these zombie movies is really about real zombies (to wit, animated corpses raised from their graves) and that is the final disappointment.  We will try for better lucky with out next set of offerings, ""The Killer Shrews"" and ""I Bury the Living.""",1116028800,3,4399,4.716710182767624
7892347,3,6305636400,"I thought the movie was entertaining and humorous.  It was a typical zombie movie of the era (Caribbean Island with old house,and a sinster character controlling the zombies) with a plus--humor provided by Mantan Morland (he also starred in some Charlie Chan movies).",1079395200,3,267,5.209302325581396

of The Zombies has to rank right at #1, personally that is.
Yet King of The Zombies is not really ""horror"", it is actually
a comedy with Mantan Moreland as the TRUE STAR of this picture.
The Roan Archive DVD edition of this film is beautifully
restored to crystal clarity. Other DVD versions of this film
I have seen were either too dark or the source material was of
a bad VHS transfer to disc variety. Now, enjoy the film.",1060905600,13,488,4.315217391304348
7892349,3,6305636400,"""King of the Zombies,""  a poverty row flick from 1941, is pretty low brow, by anybody's standards.  The film is a comedy-thriller about zombies, graveyards, hypnotism, voodoo, foreign agents, and espionage.  The  best two characters are manservant Jefferson ""Jeff"" Jackson  (Mantan Moreland) and kitchen maid Samantha (Marguerite Whitten).  From the  perspective of contemporary sensibilities, some viewers may have a problem  with Moreland's style of ethnic based comedy relief.  Taken within the  context of the movie, however, Moreland is hilarious, especially in his  comic exchanges with the savvy, sassy, sexy, and utterly delighful  Samantha.  After three men crash on a remote tropical island, mysterious  things begin to happen.  Their sinister host, Dr. Sangre (Henry Victor) is  obviously up to no good with his spooky servants, his mesmerized wife, and  the army of zombies he is building through voodoo rituals and strange  rites.  There's some World War II nonsense about foreign agents threatening  the defense plans of the U.S. Navy.  The servants all say, ""Yes,  Master!"" to Dr. Sangre.  It's enough to make one yearn for Bela  Lugosi.  The best scenes are between Jeff and Samantha; especially after  Jeff is hynotized into believing he is a zombie.  The ""zombie squad  reporting for dinner"" segment is laugh-out-loud funny!  Jeff and  Samantha are great as a comedy team, and they are given adequate screen  time.  Jeff can be considered the main character by the film's end.  He is  the catalyst that sets some of the critical plot developments in motion.  The rest of the cast is pretty insipid.  Ditto for the plot.  The action  builds to a very dull climax.  The movie's low brow humor is its redeeming  quality.  It's the same type of fun we've had from such various types as  the East Side Kids in ""Spooks Run Wild"" and Abbott and Costello  in their encounters with Frankenstein, etc.  Adjust your expectations  accordingly.",942883200,24,1949,5.145161290322581
