3153260,4,B001675YQ6,"It got panned when it first came out, don't listen to those reviews though. THis movie is really good and Brittany Murphy is stunning in it.",1220659200,,140,4.423076923076923
3153261,5,B001675YQ6,This movie is perfect!  Wonderfully witty romantic comedy that constantly picks on the ridiculousness of the romantic comedy.  Both a chick flick and a great guy comedy.  And not what you'd expect from Brittany Murphy; a very welcome surprise.,1219881600,4,243,5.17948717948718
3153262,5,B001675YQ6,"Anyone who's in love with Breakfast at Tiffany's will simply love this movie which is at the same time a tribute and a light parody of the 1961 classic.
The story relates the twists and turns of love lives (absolutely separate!) of a struggling gay writer, a girl who dreams about true love and a group of their usually equally twisted friends. Their attempts at finding the one and only can be quite hilarious (Murphy's character Jacks is blind to the advances of Paolo who she thinks is gay and she goes as far as to get him on a blind date with Rhys' character) but the film manages to present them in a way which is both true and touching. A perfect light entertainment - don't miss it!",1219536000,3,690,4.3565891472868215
3153263,3,B001675YQ6,"I like Brittany Murphy a lot but this is not the right vehicle for her. She's not a fashionista and lacks the kind of poise it takes to walk comfortably in high heels. Almost all of the shots of her 'strutting' were cut to less than a step so you can see what she looks like but not how she moves. It was the same with the tango dance scene. Quick edits work as a disguise. I don't think the beehive hairdos work on her but if you like Brittany Murphy you should see this film. It won't make you dislike her and the film is mildly clever.

A handful of male actors performed well and gave the film most of its charm. The two female actors, besides Brittany, were junk. The two women, mother and daughter, trying to act likeably eccentric were annoying, shallow and superfluous to the story. They weren't even acceptable caricatures of likeably eccentric. Chain smoking cigarettes does not eccentric make.

I don't think it really counts as a spoiler to let people know that Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom are on the screen for about 20 seconds. That was part of the cleverness of the film. They 'play' the parts of the 'happily-ever-after' couple in the Hollywood version of the movie we're watching as it is written by one of the characters in the movie.",1218672000,2,1258,4.465217391304348
3153264,4,B001675YQ6,"In a genre littered with hundreds of samey quickly-forgotten offerings of mediocre quality, this one differentiates itself surprisingly well.  The story is older than Shakespeare:  girl meets boy, boy likes girl, but the inevitable misunderstandings contrive to keep them apart until the end.  Nothing new, but what raises ""Love"" from the crowd is both its shameless tongue-in-cheek manner and its distinctly British sensibility - as present in some scathingly hilarious dialogue.  It won't be everyone's cup of tea, certainly, but if you're a fan of British (or just plan snarky) humour, and you enjoy movies that don't take themselves seriously, I can't recommend this one to you enough.",1217376000,8,689,5.351851851851852
3153265,3,B001675YQ6,"An offbeat comedy treat that will entertain some viewers and annoy others.  There are some enjoyable humorous scenes and some touching romantic moments but this movie is not for everyone.

Brittany Murphy's performance is pretty good, but Matthew Rhys seems to shine more brightly in this talented but quirky ensemble cast.  The chemistry between Brittany and Santiago Cabrera, while leading to a predictable outcome, is endearing and at times downright funny.

Give this one a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised.",1213833600,13,523,5.341463414634147
3153266,5,B001675YQ6,"This movie is fabulous! Cute romantic comedy that is not beyond making fun of itself.  The cast is great but the scene stealer is Catherine Tate who plays Tallulah. For me this is a ""Must see""!",1211760000,3,193,4.361111111111111
3153267,1,B001675YQ6,"This movie does not contain the degree of wit and irony to pull off the whole ""we're talking about a movie within a movie"" concept.
The American/British accent Murphy displays is covered up by the excuse ""she grew up in America,"" how opaque.

3153275,5,B001675YQ6,"This delightful comedy about the rocky road to true love stars Brittany Murphy as the free-spirited ""Jacks."" An assistant at British Vogue, Jacks adores fixing up her friends, but when it comes to finding the right guy for herself, she's totally clueless. Love comes knocking at her door when she meets sexy photographer Paolo (Santiago Cabrera), but will she dare to let her guard down and let romance in? Such a sweet movie with lots of laughs and good hearted smiles, too. Brittany is still sleeping with her Ex, more of convenience than anything. She has a gay roommate who sees the perfect man Re: Handsome man in the lobby of a hotel and obsesses and both of these people have already met people in their lives that are perfect for them but they just don't see it. The entire cast from beginning to end was terrific Brittany, her gay friend, their lush of a girl friend, EVERYONE. The fact that it takes place in England is a bonus.

3153283,5,B001675YQ6,"Entertaining to say the least. Points to a more sadistic sad coupled version of how romance doesn't always guarantee a love that is worth treasuring. All characters in the film are witty and outgoing to the point where you're almost entirely involved with what it is the film has to deliver. Among Brittany Murphy's numerous films, she is very well known to be funny in an almost hit on the side of the head kind of way. This movie does that for you. If you're looking for a romantic comedy that is going to put a glimmer of hope in the pinched out distress of why it is that relationships don't develop as we'd wish that the would. This movie tags you along for that ride. Through glitzy wardrobes and clever scene suggestions, this film truly brings out the virtuous talents and off set practices that it takes to see life as an enjoyable joke. Where the joke is, that love comes in all different types of shapes and sizes. You just have to be able to wear the costume.",1430352000,,971,4.4

3153316,3,B001675YQ6,"An ultra-modern romantic comedy that portrays heterosexual and homosexual relationships with an openness and candor deemed either deserved or shocking depending on one's point of view,  Love and Other Disasters explores the complex difficulties inherent in modern relationships while poking fun at those relationships and the business of movie making.

The straight ""British Vogue"" assistant Emily ""Jacks"" Jackson (Brittany Murphy) and the openly homosexual Peter Simon (Matthew Rhys) are best friends who live together with a familiarity that's usually reserved for the closest of family members. Bathroom chats while one takes a shower and the other sits on the toilet are commonplace in this household and that same openness extends to discussions of their romantic and sexual relationships with the same or opposite sex.

Jacks' usually accurate ""gaydar"" fails her when she meets photographer Paolo Sarmiento (Santiago Carbrera) and thus begins a complicated relationship between Paolo and Jacks in which Jacks attempts to set Paolo up with Peter without his knowledge and Paolo yearns for a relationship with Jacks while assuming that she's romantically involved with Peter.

Add into this unusual love triangle an ex-boyfriend James (Elliot Cowen) whom Jacks is still sleeping with out of pity; Jacks' emotionally distraught friend Tallulah (Catherine Tate); an elusive David Williams (Will Keen) who Peter bumps into and declares the object of love at first sight even though the two have never actually met; and a host of other farcically odd characters and the stage is set for a romantic comedy unlike any other.

On top of it all, James is struggling to write a screenplay that reflects his own reality, but is finding honesty hard to adhere to in the Hollywood business of movie making.

Guest cameos include Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom. Viewers will find this modern twist on the classic romantic comedy quite funny and entertaining as long as they are willing to put aside any homophobic tendencies and laugh at the absurdities of the world we live in.",1392163200,,2072,5.282674772036474

it is humorous and cute... i'd probably watch it again. i also liked how i kept thinking...what a holly golightly character and then they watched breakfast at tiffany's! that was perfect. it's a BM role at matches the cuteness of Clueless. so sad she's no longer with us.",1391731200,,609,4.342105263157895

3153331,3,B001675YQ6,"Such a shame that Brittany Murphy died at such a young age. From her early days in Clueless right up to the end she was always able to portray the ""insecure/unsure waif just looking for acceptance"" to a very high quality, and this movie is no different. Looking as comfortable and effortless on screen as any of the greats, this movie (while not the quality of a Julia Roberts film) moves right along for Brittany, in the ""love lost/won't get hurt again/love found"" mold of typical 20's angst.

3153351,3,B001675YQ6,"I hate to repeat the sentiments of the other reviewers here, but this movie can't help but be a reminder of the loss of the wonderfully talanted rising star, Brittany Murphy. She truly shines in this delightful flick, especially with her quirky American, yet not quite British accent (I found it endearing, not cheesey as a few others have written here). The additions of Matthew Rhys (The Americans), Catherine Tate (Dr. Who) who is a hoot, Dawn French (French and Saunders fame) who puts in an appearance as the hilarious therapist, and even Orlando Bloom (./drools) round out the comedy stylings of this lighthearted romantic romp. Sure it runs the gamut of comedic plot devices and cliches, but what romantic comedy doesn't? It even begins pointing out how predictable these types of movies are and poking fun at itself. I appreciate when people and movies don't take themselves seriously. I was with them totally up until the ending, which left me feeling a bit let down (I hadn't predicted that).

The comedy works as well as the romance, and the characters poke fun at movie stereotypes as well as at themselves (the wacky smoker gal is hilarious) and the relationships are brightly played out in the 90 minute run-time. From start to finish I couldn't find anything wrong with this one!

There are 3 central characters, each trying to find love, each with lessons to learn. The gay roomate's story is especially touching.

In the film the characters watch ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and one states its her favorite film. That older film may be a classic, but I enjoyed this one much more.

3153390,1,B001675YQ6,"Up until now I have enjoyed all of Brittany Murphy's films that I've seen.  This one is just plain bad.  It starts out with a rich, successful 20 something woman with a history of unstable relationships and a fake British accent whose best friend is a gay man.  Gee, how original.  Now, where have I seen that before??  Oh yes, Bridget Jones's diary - part 1 and 2!  Then the plot starts to focus on the men in her life more than on her, which I found annoying in a supposed chick flick - not that her character was all that beguiling to begin with.  It is made unbelievable enough by the truly laughable fake British accent, but her little eccentricities fail to come off as cute or endearing, they just seem ridiculous.  It's very boring at first, and then it gets worse.  There is a painful scene where she is at some sort of art show and the camera focuses us way too long on this hideous anti-meat ""art"" that tops PETA films in goriness, and you can't get away from it.  It is just there on the screne for way too long.  Brittany's character makes the comment that she ""isn't drunk enough for this"" and I breathed a sigh of relief thinking this would be the perfect time to switch scenes, but no!  It goes on and on, and even includes some horrific poetry - which was almost but not quite bad enough to be funny, and even the shock value of it was too outdated to work.  If you are watching this with anyone else, you will feel extremely uncomfortable during this scene, as the metaphors were disgusting!! If it was painful for the characters, why make the audience endure it?  Perhaps some people will find it bad enough to be amusing but I did not.  After about 10 minutes I had seen enough.  The characters and plot were hopelessly cliched and predictable (in fact, after those 10 minutes I already knew what was going to happen, and after reading others' comments it turns out I was exactly right!).

3153413,3,B001675YQ6,"""Love and other Disasters"" was a difficult call for me.  I enjoyed some parts of it but ultimately, there was just too much of it which did not ring true and which I simply could not believe.  To be fair, the movie sets up its own premise for why the plot might be unbelievable, and while that is clever (and, in fact, some of the more interesting parts of tghe movie involved this minor subterfuge) in the end it just served to confuse things and ultimately, doesn't really excuse a poor script even if it explains it.

The premise I spoke of is that one of the characters is a wannabe screenwriter and various elements in the movie raise the question of whether we are watching the exploits of this screenwriter and his friends or whether we are actually watching the movie he scripted based on those exploits.  There are a number of jokes about movie cliches which, of course, show up in the screenplay.  These were some of my favorite parts of the movie but like I said, this sort of campiness, in the end, was more of a weakness than a strength.

The movie had likeable characters and frankly, I normally find Murphy's charm hard to resist (so sad that she died so young) but it was pretty easy to resist here.  The movie could have been interesting with a better script, but it truly was full of cliches and weak plot points which had me groaning.  For instance, one of the principal plot elements involves a man who is interested in Brittany Murphy's character but she believes him to be homosexual, based on some pretty specious reasoning, and so she decides to try to set him up with her homosexual roommate.  He, on the other hand, presumes that she is romantically involved with her roommate -- and of course, they both miss several clues which could have put an end to the whole misunderstanding instantly but we are supposed to believe that what is obvious to the audience is somehow invisible to the characters.  How many times have you seen that basic setup before, in sitcoms, other movies, etc.?  (in modern shows, the homosexual angle is common -- in older ones it was usually married vs. single or simply a mutual presumption that the other is interested in someone else).  Then there's Murphy's character herself -- another cliche: in her circle of friends she is the ""glue"" who holds them all together, solves their problems, talks them through their heartbreaks, etc., but has no insight at all into herself.  While cliched, that part is at least believable, but there are a couple or three places in the movie where an issue requires action and, without missing a beat (or stopping, even for a moment, to consider the situation) she just starts barking out orders to her friends like a platoon sergeant taking a hill.  So, apparently she is so bright that her friends routinely look to her for guidance, she can assess a situation in an instant and immediately decide on a course of action involving multiple steps and people and which she commits to without a moment's hesitation, but she can't figure out that a straight guy with an obvious interest in her isn't a homosexual looking to hook up with her roommate.

I can't recommend this -- the movie within a movie could have been a fun twist if the rest of the script had been strong enough to support it (and if the writer hadn't chose to blur the lines between reality and writer's creation).  To be sure it is no worse than many of the other movies and sitcoms which have used these same overworn cliches, which is hardly a recommendation in my book, but if that doesn't bother you, perhaps you'd enjoy the movie.",1321920000,2,3593,4.573208722741433
3153414,3,B001675YQ6,Reasonable chick flick.  You see some of the same themes that you see in other similar movies.  Kind of painful to watch this if you are a guy and I am sure a lot of girls out there will enjoy it very much.,1319932800,,206,3.7674418604651163

Acting-wise, things weren't bad, but I wasn't blown away either. Brittany stole the show as my favorite because she was quite charming a lot of the time with her dialogue but could be serious when called for too (R.I.P.). However, I could actually relate to Matthew Rhys' character's withdrawn-from-reality state of mind. His view and approach to relationships hit too close to home. I was rooting for him the whole time since he was the main underdog.

All in all, I'm totally glad I used up an hour and a half of my life to watch this crazy movie. It was kinda dark, but not completely. I won't really give anything away because I want you to form your own opinions. I think it's worth watching though!

- great iconic London settings
- great wardrobe
- the irrepressible Brittany
- brilliant cast:  the casting director deserves a prize - from the drop dead gorgeous male lead to the others.  All more or less well-known accomplished romantic comedy actors (despite a previous reviewer's comments).

3153430,5,B001675YQ6,"Whatever your taste in good movies, you will like at least some parts, if not all, of this movie.  Even if you find it hard to embrace this movie, you will find it even harder to dislike it.

At the risk of being controversial, I will rate this movie above multi-threaded ensemble movies like ""Love Actually"", ""Crash"", ""Valentine's Day"" and ""New York, I Love You"".  The surprise is in a singular actress carrying the entire movie, supported by a cast of relatively unknown but competent actors.

As I am writing this review, James Taylor is coming on ""live"" at the Oscar presentation (this is Oscar night, 7th March in the USA) with Brittany Murphy being remembered on screeen, and her image reprised at the end of Taylor's solo ""In My Life"".  We will never know if she would earn an Oscar one day, but from her performance in this movie, it is not possible to rule out her future potential.  I have watched ""Ramen Girl"", ""Uptown Girls"" and the Futurama with Brittany's voice, and I went on a binge of Brittany Murphy's movies like ""Little Black Book"" after I got the news that no more movies would be made by this great actress.  This movie was among the prominent ones recommended by Amazon when keying in the actress' name.  The movie surprises at many levels.

From earlier reviews I gathered that the plot was going to less straightforward than ""Ramen Girl"" or ""Uptown Girls"".  Without going into the story line, I like this movie because:

1.  The acting was serious, focused and well directed.  I cannot think of another actress who could have been better cast in the main role.  The British accents all round were from good character thespians.

2.  The cinematography was good.  There were refreshing camera angles of contemporary London.  The Houses of Parliament framed by the London Eye (across the river) was one such unexpected view.

3.  The colours were bright.  Like on picture post-cards.  The indoor shots were unusually bright and colourful.  No dim ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" artwork requiring Night Vision Goggles here.  Brittany Murphy's fully nude body in a kitchen scene(strategically covered by a copy of ""The Naked Chef"") was boldly illuminated.  Refreshing to see the details of English interior furnishing instead of the usual American home interiors.

4.  For an adult movie, there was relatively little swearing.  Then there is a sensible plot. It is fun, but does not sit well as a chick-flick.  Nobody picks up a movie like this to feel depressed at the end.  Best watched together with close friend(s): beer/alcohol optional, not a necessity.  For morbid, pick up ""Deadline"" or ""Dead Girl"".

Brittany Murphy does a good ""damsel in distress"" with pleading doe-like eyes, as in ""Ramen Girl"".  This appears be a recurring pattern in her movies.  Well, if you are good at something, keep doing it -  Denzel Washington does a good ""Don't lie to me"", Tom Hanks replayed ""stupid"" in ""You've Got Mail"" and Julia Roberts does a good petulant temper tantrum in ""Pretty Woman"", ""Pelican Brief"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and so on.  I thought that Brittany's waif-like begging was similarly getting to be one of her acting trade-marks.

I am glad to have experienced this movie.",1268006400,30,3188,4.837037037037037

3153432,4,B001675YQ6,"It was such a shame when young and vivacious Brittany Murphy died in December 2009 at age 32, depriving the film world of her sunny countenance. Along with the biopic of rapper Eminem, 8 Mile --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-Mile-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JLQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 Mile (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;-- this was my favorite Brittany Murphy film.

A few words of disclosure are necessary about this film. ""Love and Other Disasters"" is a romantic comedy set in London. There is not one original idea in the script and just about every movie cliche to be found in romantic comedies is in this movie to wit:
-- Murphy is a fashion designer with a mixed up love life.
-- She befriends a gay photographer (who is actually not gay) that loves her.
-- There are several other gay male characters in the film with mixed up love lives.
-- In fact, all the characters in the film have a mixed up love life.
-- All the actors are employed in the arts -- once writes a screeplay called ""Love and Other Disasters.""
-- The film appears to be heading to tragedy but has a wonderful, happy ending.
-- The movie ends by having the action in the film made into a movie.

Having made these disclosures, I will say I adore this movie. This is such a warm film, so full of good spirits and love, that it transcends all these cliches to be not only good entertainment but a memorable film experience. The chemistry between Jacks (Murphy) and Paolo (Santiago Cabrera) is natural, unforced and credible. Almost all the actors are likeable, you root for them, and you want their love to succeed. And it does.

I can't think of a romantic comedy I've seen in recent years that I enjoy as much as this 2006 production. It's better than ""Four Weddings And A Funeral""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral/dp/B00000JRTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>&nbsp;to which I think it compares very well.

I happened to catch it, maybe 4 years ago as part of the Toronto International Film Fesival, when it was one of the movies showing that year.  I saw it with two friends and we all enjoyed it very much!  It's light...it's funny...it's cute...a great date movie...and has something for all adults, gay and straight alike (as it has a slight gay element) who like a good romantic comedy.  After we saw it.... we never heard another thing about it.  It never apparently found a distributor, and never was shown in theaters, to my knowledge.  About three years later...it appeared on DVD.  I have owned a copy since it came out on DVD and we had one of our ""Movie nights"" at our home with 8 or 9 friends over, and everyone enjoyed it a lot!

What amazes me in the movie business is all of the total garbage movies that get made and shown in theaters every week..... bad, awful, poorly made and poorly acted films that should never even be produced.... and then there are movies like ""Love and Other Disaster"" that are well-made, with good acting, and they never see the light of day.",1254096000,60,1152,4.42654028436019

Their attempts at finding the one and only can be quite hilarious (Murphy's character Jacks is blind to the advances of Paolo who she thinks is gay and she goes as far as to get him on a blind date with Rhys' character) but the film manages to present them in a way which is both true and touching.

3387760,3,B001675YQ6,"I like Brittany Murphy a lot but this is not the right vehicle for her. She's not a fashionista and lacks the kind of poise it takes to walk comfortably in high heels. Almost all of the shots of her 'strutting' were cut to less than a step so you can see what she looks like but not how she moves. It was the same with the tango dance scene. Quick edits work as a disguise. I don't think the beehive hairdos work on her but if you like Brittany Murphy you should see this film. It won't make you dislike her and the film is mildly clever.

A handful of male actors performed well and gave the film most of its charm. The two female actors, besides Brittany, were junk. The two women, mother and daughter, trying to act likeably eccentric were annoying, shallow and superfluous to the story. They weren't even acceptable caricatures of likeably eccentric. Chain smoking cigarettes does not eccentric make.

I don't think it really counts as a spoiler to let people know that Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom are on the screen for about 20 seconds. That was part of the cleverness of the film. They 'play' the parts of the 'happily-ever-after' couple in the Hollywood version of the movie we're watching as it is written by one of the characters in the movie.",1218672000,2,1258,4.465217391304348

3387813,3,B001675YQ6,"An ultra-modern romantic comedy that portrays heterosexual and homosexual relationships with an openness and candor deemed either deserved or shocking depending on one's point of view,  Love and Other Disasters explores the complex difficulties inherent in modern relationships while poking fun at those relationships and the business of movie making.

The straight ""British Vogue"" assistant Emily ""Jacks"" Jackson (Brittany Murphy) and the openly homosexual Peter Simon (Matthew Rhys) are best friends who live together with a familiarity that's usually reserved for the closest of family members. Bathroom chats while one takes a shower and the other sits on the toilet are commonplace in this household and that same openness extends to discussions of their romantic and sexual relationships with the same or opposite sex.

Jacks' usually accurate ""gaydar"" fails her when she meets photographer Paolo Sarmiento (Santiago Carbrera) and thus begins a complicated relationship between Paolo and Jacks in which Jacks attempts to set Paolo up with Peter without his knowledge and Paolo yearns for a relationship with Jacks while assuming that she's romantically involved with Peter.

Add into this unusual love triangle an ex-boyfriend James (Elliot Cowen) whom Jacks is still sleeping with out of pity; Jacks' emotionally distraught friend Tallulah (Catherine Tate); an elusive David Williams (Will Keen) who Peter bumps into and declares the object of love at first sight even though the two have never actually met; and a host of other farcically odd characters and the stage is set for a romantic comedy unlike any other.

On top of it all, James is struggling to write a screenplay that reflects his own reality, but is finding honesty hard to adhere to in the Hollywood business of movie making.

Guest cameos include Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom. Viewers will find this modern twist on the classic romantic comedy quite funny and entertaining as long as they are willing to put aside any homophobic tendencies and laugh at the absurdities of the world we live in.",1392163200,,2072,5.282674772036474

it is humorous and cute... i'd probably watch it again. i also liked how i kept thinking...what a holly golightly character and then they watched breakfast at tiffany's! that was perfect. it's a BM role at matches the cuteness of Clueless. so sad she's no longer with us.",1391731200,,609,4.342105263157895

From her early days in Clueless right up to the end she was always able to portray the ""insecure/unsure waif just looking for acceptance"" to a very high quality, and this movie is no different. Looking as comfortable and effortless on screen as any of the greats, this movie (while not the quality of a Julia Roberts film) moves right along for Brittany, in the ""love lost/won't get hurt again/love found"" mold of typical 20's angst.

3387848,3,B001675YQ6,"I hate to repeat the sentiments of the other reviewers here, but this movie can't help but be a reminder of the loss of the wonderfully talanted rising star, Brittany Murphy. She truly shines in this delightful flick, especially with her quirky American, yet not quite British accent (I found it endearing, not cheesey as a few others have written here). The additions of Matthew Rhys (The Americans), Catherine Tate (Dr. Who) who is a hoot, Dawn French (French and Saunders fame) who puts in an appearance as the hilarious therapist, and even Orlando Bloom (./drools) round out the comedy stylings of this lighthearted romantic romp. Sure it runs the gamut of comedic plot devices and cliches, but what romantic comedy doesn't? It even begins pointing out how predictable these types of movies are and poking fun at itself. I appreciate when people and movies don't take themselves seriously. I was with them totally up until the ending, which left me feeling a bit let down (I hadn't predicted that).

The comedy works as well as the romance, and the characters poke fun at movie stereotypes as well as at themselves (the wacky smoker gal is hilarious) and the relationships are brightly played out in the 90 minute run-time. From start to finish I couldn't find anything wrong with this one!

There are 3 central characters, each trying to find love, each with lessons to learn. The gay roomate's story is especially touching.

In the film the characters watch ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and one states its her favorite film. That older film may be a classic, but I enjoyed this one much more.

3387887,1,B001675YQ6,"Up until now I have enjoyed all of Brittany Murphy's films that I've seen.  This one is just plain bad.  It starts out with a rich, successful 20 something woman with a history of unstable relationships and a fake British accent whose best friend is a gay man.  Gee, how original.  Now, where have I seen that before??  Oh yes, Bridget Jones's diary - part 1 and 2!  Then the plot starts to focus on the men in her life more than on her, which I found annoying in a supposed chick flick - not that her character was all that beguiling to begin with.  It is made unbelievable enough by the truly laughable fake British accent, but her little eccentricities fail to come off as cute or endearing, they just seem ridiculous.  It's very boring at first, and then it gets worse.  There is a painful scene where she is at some sort of art show and the camera focuses us way too long on this hideous anti-meat ""art"" that tops PETA films in goriness, and you can't get away from it.  It is just there on the screne for way too long.  Brittany's character makes the comment that she ""isn't drunk enough for this"" and I breathed a sigh of relief thinking this would be the perfect time to switch scenes, but no!  It goes on and on, and even includes some horrific poetry - which was almost but not quite bad enough to be funny, and even the shock value of it was too outdated to work.  If you are watching this with anyone else, you will feel extremely uncomfortable during this scene, as the metaphors were disgusting!! If it was painful for the characters, why make the audience endure it?  Perhaps some people will find it bad enough to be amusing but I did not.  After about 10 minutes I had seen enough.  The characters and plot were hopelessly cliched and predictable (in fact, after those 10 minutes I already knew what was going to happen, and after reading others' comments it turns out I was exactly right!).

3387910,3,B001675YQ6,"""Love and other Disasters"" was a difficult call for me.  I enjoyed some parts of it but ultimately, there was just too much of it which did not ring true and which I simply could not believe.  To be fair, the movie sets up its own premise for why the plot might be unbelievable, and while that is clever (and, in fact, some of the more interesting parts of tghe movie involved this minor subterfuge) in the end it just served to confuse things and ultimately, doesn't really excuse a poor script even if it explains it.

The premise I spoke of is that one of the characters is a wannabe screenwriter and various elements in the movie raise the question of whether we are watching the exploits of this screenwriter and his friends or whether we are actually watching the movie he scripted based on those exploits.  There are a number of jokes about movie cliches which, of course, show up in the screenplay.  These were some of my favorite parts of the movie but like I said, this sort of campiness, in the end, was more of a weakness than a strength.

The movie had likeable characters and frankly, I normally find Murphy's charm hard to resist (so sad that she died so young) but it was pretty easy to resist here.  The movie could have been interesting with a better script, but it truly was full of cliches and weak plot points which had me groaning.  For instance, one of the principal plot elements involves a man who is interested in Brittany Murphy's character but she believes him to be homosexual, based on some pretty specious reasoning, and so she decides to try to set him up with her homosexual roommate.  He, on the other hand, presumes that she is romantically involved with her roommate -- and of course, they both miss several clues which could have put an end to the whole misunderstanding instantly but we are supposed to believe that what is obvious to the audience is somehow invisible to the characters.  How many times have you seen that basic setup before, in sitcoms, other movies, etc.?  (in modern shows, the homosexual angle is common -- in older ones it was usually married vs. single or simply a mutual presumption that the other is interested in someone else).  Then there's Murphy's character herself -- another cliche: in her circle of friends she is the ""glue"" who holds them all together, solves their problems, talks them through their heartbreaks, etc., but has no insight at all into herself.  While cliched, that part is at least believable, but there are a couple or three places in the movie where an issue requires action and, without missing a beat (or stopping, even for a moment, to consider the situation) she just starts barking out orders to her friends like a platoon sergeant taking a hill.  So, apparently she is so bright that her friends routinely look to her for guidance, she can assess a situation in an instant and immediately decide on a course of action involving multiple steps and people and which she commits to without a moment's hesitation, but she can't figure out that a straight guy with an obvious interest in her isn't a homosexual looking to hook up with her roommate.

I can't recommend this -- the movie within a movie could have been a fun twist if the rest of the script had been strong enough to support it (and if the writer hadn't chose to blur the lines between reality and writer's creation).  To be sure it is no worse than many of the other movies and sitcoms which have used these same overworn cliches, which is hardly a recommendation in my book, but if that doesn't bother you, perhaps you'd enjoy the movie.",1321920000,2,3593,4.573208722741433
3387911,3,B001675YQ6,Reasonable chick flick.  You see some of the same themes that you see in other similar movies.  Kind of painful to watch this if you are a guy and I am sure a lot of girls out there will enjoy it very much.,1319932800,,206,3.7674418604651163

Acting-wise, things weren't bad, but I wasn't blown away either. Brittany stole the show as my favorite because she was quite charming a lot of the time with her dialogue but could be serious when called for too (R.I.P.). However, I could actually relate to Matthew Rhys' character's withdrawn-from-reality state of mind. His view and approach to relationships hit too close to home. I was rooting for him the whole time since he was the main underdog.

All in all, I'm totally glad I used up an hour and a half of my life to watch this crazy movie. It was kinda dark, but not completely. I won't really give anything away because I want you to form your own opinions. I think it's worth watching though!

- great iconic London settings
- great wardrobe
- the irrepressible Brittany
- brilliant cast:  the casting director deserves a prize - from the drop dead gorgeous male lead to the others.  All more or less well-known accomplished romantic comedy actors (despite a previous reviewer's comments).

At the risk of being controversial, I will rate this movie above multi-threaded ensemble movies like ""Love Actually"", ""Crash"", ""Valentine's Day"" and ""New York, I Love You"".  The surprise is in a singular actress carrying the entire movie, supported by a cast of relatively unknown but competent actors.

As I am writing this review, James Taylor is coming on ""live"" at the Oscar presentation (this is Oscar night, 7th March in the USA) with Brittany Murphy being remembered on screeen, and her image reprised at the end of Taylor's solo ""In My Life"".  We will never know if she would earn an Oscar one day, but from her performance in this movie, it is not possible to rule out her future potential.  I have watched ""Ramen Girl"", ""Uptown Girls"" and the Futurama with Brittany's voice, and I went on a binge of Brittany Murphy's movies like ""Little Black Book"" after I got the news that no more movies would be made by this great actress.  This movie was among the prominent ones recommended by Amazon when keying in the actress' name.  The movie surprises at many levels.

From earlier reviews I gathered that the plot was going to less straightforward than ""Ramen Girl"" or ""Uptown Girls"".  Without going into the story line, I like this movie because:

1.  The acting was serious, focused and well directed.  I cannot think of another actress who could have been better cast in the main role.  The British accents all round were from good character thespians.

2.  The cinematography was good.  There were refreshing camera angles of contemporary London.  The Houses of Parliament framed by the London Eye (across the river) was one such unexpected view.

3.  The colours were bright.  Like on picture post-cards.  The indoor shots were unusually bright and colourful.  No dim ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" artwork requiring Night Vision Goggles here.  Brittany Murphy's fully nude body in a kitchen scene(strategically covered by a copy of ""The Naked Chef"") was boldly illuminated.  Refreshing to see the details of English interior furnishing instead of the usual American home interiors.

4.  For an adult movie, there was relatively little swearing.  Then there is a sensible plot. It is fun, but does not sit well as a chick-flick.  Nobody picks up a movie like this to feel depressed at the end.  Best watched together with close friend(s): beer/alcohol optional, not a necessity.  For morbid, pick up ""Deadline"" or ""Dead Girl"".

Brittany Murphy does a good ""damsel in distress"" with pleading doe-like eyes, as in ""Ramen Girl"".  This appears be a recurring pattern in her movies.  Well, if you are good at something, keep doing it -  Denzel Washington does a good ""Don't lie to me"", Tom Hanks replayed ""stupid"" in ""You've Got Mail"" and Julia Roberts does a good petulant temper tantrum in ""Pretty Woman"", ""Pelican Brief"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and so on.  I thought that Brittany's waif-like begging was similarly getting to be one of her acting trade-marks.

A few words of disclosure are necessary about this film. ""Love and Other Disasters"" is a romantic comedy set in London. There is not one original idea in the script and just about every movie cliche to be found in romantic comedies is in this movie to wit:
-- Murphy is a fashion designer with a mixed up love life.
-- She befriends a gay photographer (who is actually not gay) that loves her.
-- There are several other gay male characters in the film with mixed up love lives.
-- In fact, all the characters in the film have a mixed up love life.
-- All the actors are employed in the arts -- once writes a screeplay called ""Love and Other Disasters.""
-- The film appears to be heading to tragedy but has a wonderful, happy ending.
-- The movie ends by having the action in the film made into a movie.

Having made these disclosures, I will say I adore this movie. This is such a warm film, so full of good spirits and love, that it transcends all these cliches to be not only good entertainment but a memorable film experience. The chemistry between Jacks (Murphy) and Paolo (Santiago Cabrera) is natural, unforced and credible. Almost all the actors are likeable, you root for them, and you want their love to succeed. And it does.

I can't think of a romantic comedy I've seen in recent years that I enjoy as much as this 2006 production. It's better than ""Four Weddings And A Funeral""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral/dp/B00000JRTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>&nbsp;to which I think it compares very well. This is a sexy, delightful, easy on the eye and mind film that breezes through its 100 minutes and leaves you satisfied. If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment with a big warmth factor, this movie is for you.",1263600000,30,2251,5.229916897506925

3387931,4,B001675YQ6,"Love and Other Disasters is a film that very few people even know about.  I happened to catch it, maybe 4 years ago as part of the Toronto International Film Fesival, when it was one of the movies showing that year.  I saw it with two friends and we all enjoyed it very much!  It's light...it's funny...it's cute...a great date movie...and has something for all adults, gay and straight alike (as it has a slight gay element) who like a good romantic comedy.  After we saw it.... we never heard another thing about it.  It never apparently found a distributor, and never was shown in theaters, to my knowledge.  About three years later...it appeared on DVD.  I have owned a copy since it came out on DVD and we had one of our ""Movie nights"" at our home with 8 or 9 friends over, and everyone enjoyed it a lot!

What amazes me in the movie business is all of the total garbage movies that get made and shown in theaters every week..... bad, awful, poorly made and poorly acted films that should never even be produced.... and then there are movies like ""Love and Other Disaster"" that are well-made, with good acting, and they never see the light of day.",1254096000,60,1152,4.42654028436019

3387933,5,B001675YQ6,"I thought love and other disasters was funny and witty. Brittney Murphy was a riot. Every character was fun and interesting in their own unique way. The story line was real even though it was a comedy. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves when harry met sally, sleepless in seattle,or jersey girl with jamie gertz.",1236211200,2,326,4.637931034482759
3387934,4,B001675YQ6,"Brittany Murphy gives a wonderful performance in this little romantic comedy film.  Set in London, most actors (except for Murphy's character Jacks) are British.  Jacks works in fashion industry that explains her fashionable outfits and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" movie obsession.  She is in a relationship with a guy she does not love and meddles with all of her friends' love lives.  Every time she meddles she gets is wrong.  Her roomate is openly guy so we have a new twist on the modern day relationships in a big city (like London).

I just cannot get it out of my head that this is just a different take on Jane Austen's ""Emma"".  It is almost confirmed when at the end of the movie Gwyneth Paltrow shows up for a brief scene.  Lots os fun, great performance by Murphy, fantastic fashion, real European cinema feel to it.  This comedy will entertain you for a time beeing, but will not leave a lasting impression.",1232150400,,917,4.645962732919255
