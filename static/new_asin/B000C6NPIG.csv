It's so much fun, it's hard to know where to start... The plot for instance is nothing but pure madness : Three buddies ( two average loosers and the bro of one of them who happens to be a dwarf ) hang out in some californian desert. They try to scare each other talking about a mad doctor who is slaughtering people around the place. Of course the legend is true and, in no time, they all captured by the guy. The two average joes are quickly butchered and the dwarf you asking ? Well, he's raped by the mad doctor and left for dead. Now that's one hell of a start but wait, wait... It's so far from being over. Actually, the dwarf is not dead but he completely lost it so he starts killing women in the nearest town and even rapes their corpses !! Meanwhile, two cops investigate the mad doctor's case and a group of sexy ladies decide to throw a party around his place...
I guess that by now you know if you want to watch that ( who wouldn't ? ).
You still need to know that it is a micro-budget flick ( kind of like the ones SUB ROSA or BRAIN DAMAGE distribute )and if you can't go beyond that, don't bother because it just wasn't made for you. On the other hand, all the real cheese lovers are going to have a lot of bloody fun. The killings are really cheap looking but gruesome and cruel, the ladies are beautiful ( SLEEPAWAY CAMP's FELISSA ROSE and legendary BRINKE STEVENS are in the house )and you got hilarious cameos by RON ""PORN KING"" JEREMY and TROMA's guru LOYD KAUFMAN. What else do you need ?
SLAUGHTER PARTY deserves 5 stars for what it is : a cheap insane sleazy slasher delivering the goods. And finally, to the filmmakers FRED ROSENBERG and CRIS WATSON, you don't need to apologize to me for sitting through this : it was my pleasure.",1198022400,2,1918,4.254794520547946
