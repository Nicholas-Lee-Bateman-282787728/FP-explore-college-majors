8758715,2,B01EGQH812,"Maddie Usher ( Ramlah Frediani) ushers her autistic child Jonah (Charlie Koudsi) into a new home and has the support of her New Age sister Amber (Tegan Ashton Cohan). Jonah, who is mute, doesn't like the house, He draws pictures of a large naked man....and we know where this is going.

The script attempted to change up the formula a bit, but there is only so much you can do. Jonah gets blamed for things and then...We do have options...Captain Howdy, ghosts, mom is crazy, or maybe someone is living in the walls of the house. Dialogue and soundtrack was similar to a made for TV film. Odd twist.
