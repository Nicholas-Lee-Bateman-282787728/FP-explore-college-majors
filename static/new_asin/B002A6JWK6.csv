8359035,1,B002A6JWK6,Could not be played on a US DVD player.  I had to return it.  Very disappointed.  Cannot locate seasons 3 and 4 in US format.  Thanks,1454630400,,133,4.0
8359036,5,B002A6JWK6,"When I bought this series for my daughter for Christmas, I found season 1/2 (region 4 PAL) on Amazon.uk for $75 USD.  I found season 3/4 (region 4 PAL) from some place in Australia for around $80 USD.  There was an earlier DVD run of the series, it appeared to me, but they were so intensely expensive!  Each volume of 3 eps was around $400+ USD!  There was no way I was going to go for anything like that.  Well, I considered myself lucky, and when my daughter received them, she was so happy!  Been happy ever since.  I've seen that the price has come down to $50 USD per volume and no special ordering from expensive companies in Australia.  Thank you Amazon for making so much available to us!  This is truly one of the best shows for kids.",1438992000,,744,4.257142857142857

When he is over for the weekend, we have popcorn night and watch about 3 episodes before bed.  I enjoy them as much as he does.",1399939200,,264,4.137254901960785
