8322694,3,B001N0LESI,Wish it was more in depth. Must say I'm biased as I know one of the actresses. She's better than she let on when I met her in person.,1497312000,,133,3.6206896551724137
8322695,1,B001N0LESI,Maybe it would be a good movie if they would make a full length version.  I paid 1.99 just to watch what seemed like a movie trailer.,1289001600,,133,3.925925925925926

8322697,2,B001N0LESI,"This was one of the most boring films I have ever seen.  It was extremely short for the subject matter presented, and the acting was amateur at best.
