7936935,4,B00005B6N3,"When the ship's crew come to the house and find no one there, I couldn't figure out how that could have happened, exactly. Twist at the end was interesting, though I didn't see how, given the circumstances of other victims, how that could have been possible. Plot inconsistencies aside, this was pretty good.",1465516800,,308,4.830188679245283

7936938,3,B00005B6N3,One incredible shot (an assassin's eye as seen through rifle scope from the front) and an otherwise average flaky murder mystery. Cool period living room.,1441670400,,154,5.2

7936940,2,B00005B6N3,"Mario Bava's work as a filmmaker has been interesting  over the years.
However,  when looking for a good, solid Bava production look no further than ""Black Sunday ( aka: Mask of Satan.)""",1400198400,,186,4.78125
7936941,4,B00005B6N3,"A group of industrialists is visiting the isolated, island home of a scientist. They are there to purchase his formula for a new type of resin, but he won't sell. Meanwhile, the wives of the businessmen are bored stiff, so they take turns hooking up w/ the houseboy. Predictably, he ends up w/ a knife in his ribs. Now, the phone is dead, and the boats have disappeared! After hanging the houseboy in the walk-in freezer, the tycoons get back to their attempts to undermine each other, and secure the professor's formula. Here begins a rather dull period before anything remotely interesting happens. At least all of the women are stunningly beautiful, but even that gets old during this 30 minute dead zone! Thankfully, the pace eventually picks up when the Professor is shot by a sniper. Now, the businessmen are trapped, and suspicious of each other. A perfect set-up for the rest of this little murder mystery. Suffice it to say that they just might need a bigger freezer! While not Bava's best film, FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON is entertaining nonetheless...",1384819200,3,1065,4.793478260869565
