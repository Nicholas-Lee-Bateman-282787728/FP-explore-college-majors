1425480,5,B00005EAXF,"This is absolutely one of my favorite music dvd's.  I am a Scorpions fan, and have been one for nearly thirty years.  These versions of classic songs, and the re-make Dust In The Wind are awesome.  I find it hard to compare it to Moment Of Glory, but I love both of these 'departure' dvd's.",1167609600,3,290,4.236363636363636
1425481,5,B00005EAXF,"This DVD (and also CD with abt. 75 % of songs) was recorded live in Portuguese monastery more or less ""unplugged"" (bass guitar was mostly electric though). New acoustic arrangements gave old classics a new life, plus there are 2 or three new songs and three cover-versions: Dust in the Wind (""Kansas"" original), Drive (from ""Cars"") and Love of my Life ('Queen', of course). Total of 21 tracks, and I should say that 17 or 18 of them are played real good. Five members of the band plus one (Brazilian?) percussionist, one extra ac. gtr. player, a keyboard/orchestrations/arrangements wizard, three background singers and a girl with cello (unfortunately, we can hear her only accasionally - thanks to Mr. Soundman). Ah, and last but not the least: great audience and fantastic dancers!

There are some interviews also, and I recall talking to Messrs. Meine & Schenker during Moscow Music peace festival in 1988 (or was it 1989? - I should check, I still got memorable T'shirt from the event :-)) and singing ""Wind of Change"" together.

Picture is exellent, but the sound - well, PCM Stereo is real good, 5.1 Dolby is not bad, but 5.1 DTS is really something: thanks to Mr. Soundman again I've had unforgettable experience - vocals from central channel (OK), gtrs from left and right front speakers (too quiet!) and very loud keyboards from left and right rear speakers!!! A real fly in the ointment, because on CD the sound is OK.

But anyway, this is a really good live DVD with different acoustic sound from the band of endless hits.

Try it and you won't be disappointed.",1151366400,7,1573,4.772058823529412
1425482,5,B00005EAXF,"This DVD shows what phenomenal musicians Scorpions truly are. The music selection is perfect, with a few new tunes thrown in. They cover songs from Kansas and The Cars as well.  I listen to the DVD over and over. Sometimes I throw it in for background music it's so good.  I wasn't sure at first if this would be any good.  There are some acoustic performances out there that aren't that good, trying to capture on the trend set by Tesla long ago.

Production quality is excellent, with many cameras set to cover the performance.  Also, there is footage from back stage, etc... If you are a Scorpions fan, or just a fan of quality rock and roll, you will very happy with this CD.",1134518400,12,679,4.4

1425499,5,B00005EAXF,"Fantastic album. I've read some other reviews that complained about them concentrating on their ballads but not only is that their specialty, it's also particularly suited to being unplugged. I highly recommend this DVD.",1390348800,,220,5.5
1425500,5,B00005EAXF,"cool concert by these old timers, and good response from the audience.  that's what makes a show excellent from the mediocre one, and this def is a hottie for a show.  scorpions really sting on this one.",1381449600,,203,4.45945945945946
1425501,5,B00005EAXF,"I have only viewed it once since receiving it but the picture and audio quality is excellent, I had viewed excerpts on youtube but to experience the DVD on my system was a treat. The performances are all excellent as well, there is always a tendency to criticize but in this case the sincerity with which the concert is delivered would render it churlish to do so. Scorpions certainly deliver the goods on this DVD, I would highly recommend it.
NB: The obvious eye candy is pretty staged but certainly forgiveable.",1380672000,2,514,4.65934065934066

1425504,5,B00005EAXF,"For any Scorpions fan this is a must have. There's no better way to show your talent is real than stripping down to acoustic basics. The guitar work is excellent, the vocals need no comment, song choice impeccable.
One of my favorites in my vast collection of concert DVD's.

1425506,5,B00005EAXF,"I bought this DVD for the first time quite some years ago - actually in Singapore when it was playing in a music store. I had not really heard or seen anything of Scorpions before but the music was too fantastic to ignore. Over the years I have continued to thoroughly enjoy a superbly crafted concert, albeit in a somewhat contrived physical environment, and while I have no pretensions as to being able to assess the quality from a solely musical perspective, the whole thing was a joy to hear. Remarkable to be reminded that so many well-known pieces were delivered by this band. The recent purchase was for a friend in the US, who was also bowled over by the superb quality and tight performances. Highly recommended whatever type of music floats your boat.",1349395200,,761,4.644444444444445
1425507,4,B00005EAXF,"We are big Scorpions fans, Acoustic is a very good concert.  Scorpions tunes set to a different beat.  We purchased the CD as well.",1338595200,,131,4.416666666666667
1425508,4,B00005EAXF,"Sometime during the 1990's, German heavy metal icons the Scorpions, seemed to have lost their enthusiasm for the genre.  Their album Face The Heat, released in 1993 was probably their last that was in the traditional heavy metal vein.  Subsequent albums&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pure-Instinct/dp/B000002JA5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pure Instinct</a>&nbsp;(1996) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-II-Eye/dp/B00000J8NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye II Eye</a>&nbsp;(1999) reflected a change in style.  Although ""You And I"" from Pure Instinct is featured in the Acoustica performance, these albums have come to be largely ignored by the band.

Still trying to find their way, in 2000 the band embarked on a project with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and conductor Christian Kolonovits, that eventually became&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scorpions-Moment-of-Glory-Live-with-the-Berlin-Philharmonic-Orchestra/dp/B000B5Y0NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scorpions: Moment of Glory - Live with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</a>&nbsp;(2000), an event released on both CD and DVD.  Acoustica is a continuation of the band's excursion down an alternate musical path, as the Scorps are basically playing unplugged, taking part in a trend that had been quite popular during the 90's.  Christian Kolonovits again joins the band for this project, playing keyboards.  Other additional musicians include Johan Daansen on guitar, and Ariana Arcu on cello.

Acoustica was recorded in Lisbon, Portugal, and features Rudolf Schenker and Matthias Jabs playing acoustic guitars.  Bass player Ralph Rieckermann, and drummer James Kottak, play their normal instruments.  While in an unusual situation, vocalist Klaus Meine is backed by three female singers.  The 21 song setlist includes classic Scorpions songs, cover tunes, and some brand new material.  The band put in a lot of effort into the performance, selecting the songs, writing new songs, developing the musical arrangements for acoustic instruments, and incorporating the other musicians into the project.

In general, the results are very good, as the ""unplugged"" approach typically brings a fresh new appreciation for material normally featuring distorted electric guitars played at extreme volume.  The arrangement for ""Catch Your Train"" for example, gives the song a whole new vibe.  Almost everything sounds terrific, and the band is having a great time in a new musical arena.  Guitarists, Jabs and Schenker, probably have to make the biggest adjustment, and they handle the transition to acoustic quite smoothly.  Softer numbers like ""Send Me An Angel"", ""Under the Same Sun"", ""You And I"", and ""Still Loving You"", probably sound the closest to the studio versions, while ""Holiday"" is given a Latin feel.  Rockers like ""Rhythm of Love"", ""The Zoo"", ""Loving You Sunday Morning"", and a jazzy version of ""Tease Me, Please Me"", might sound the most interesting unplugged.  For ""The Zoo"" and ""Tease Me, Please Me"", a number of female dancers also join the proceedings.

The new material generally works well in the acoustic format, and includes the songs ""I Wanted To Cry"", ""Life Is Too Short"", and ""Back To You"".  ""When Love Kills Love"", appears to be the most popular of the new songs.  The band is to be complemented for taking risks, but they do not fare quite as well on some of the cover tunes.  The tempo of ""Dust In the Wind"" is a little too brisk, and while Klaus Meine is unquestionably a great singer, he doesn't have quite the right voice for the song.  Likewise, he lacks the subtly to handle the Cars' ""Drive"".

The production of Acoustica is first class, and features very good image quality and a number of audio options.  The square shaped stage is quite spacious, and provides some atypical views of the musicians.  Camera coverage of the band is pretty good, and includes feeds from mobile cameras suspended over the audience.  Editing is a little fast, but there are a lot of people on stage, and the cutting is mostly sensible and not too annoying.  Probably by design, the front rows of the audience seem to consist mostly of young women.  While the Acoustica DVD contains 21 songs, the audio CD release contains only 15 songs.  For those in North America, be sure to get the Region 1 DVD.

Acoustica features the band during a time when they seem to be searching for a direction.  If like your music hard and heavy, and don't care for the ""unplugged"" thing, you may not appreciate the subtlety of this performance, which provides an opportunity to really hear the nuances of Klaus Meine's voice.  To the delight of most of their long time fans, the Scorpions returned to their heavy metal ways with the release of their next album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unbreakable/dp/B000294T2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unbreakable</a>&nbsp;(2004), and have continued in this direction on their subsequent releases.  The band is apparently in the process of completing their ""farewell tour"", but hopefully their contributions to music, either as a band or as individual musicians, will continue for many years to come.",1333065600,,5272,5.75

When I ordered Acoustica, I thought it was a recording of concert songs and not a DVD of the whole concert. A pleasant surprise. I would recommmend this DVD to any Scorpion lover or anyone who enjoys Rock.",1324166400,2,367,4.703125
1425511,5,B00005EAXF,"I've had this DVD for several months now, and it has become my ""go to"" disc when I am sick of the crap on TV.  Yes, the Scorps have a lot of concert DVDs out (and another one coming in February!), but this is a unique gem.  I was always one who loved that the Scorps delivered both in-your-face, blistering hard rock and gorgeous power ballads.  Many bands can ""bring it"" and make your ears bleed, but these guys are incredible musicians who really seem to care about their craft.  Nowhere have I seen them demonstarte it better than in this ""acoustic"" performance from Lisbon, Portugal.  The audio and video rival blu-ray in quality, and the band is as tight as ever.  The first notes Klaus sings are a bit uneven, as if he's unsure where he should be in his range given the mellower vibe.  But, a few seconds in, he locks into a groove, and his performance is amazing the rest of the way.  Most of the hits are here (some pretty true to form, and some with new arrangements), along with new songs written specifically for this show, and 3 covers (including Kansas' ""Dust In the Wind""!!).  Believe me, they nail everything!

I also have Live at Wacken, which is awesome for a Scorps concert at full octane.  The 2 DVDs work for me as a ""definitive"" collection of the Scorps live in concert.  Yes, there is a fair amount of overlap on songs between the two, but they are delivered so differently that they do not seem reptitive at all. I'm sorry to see the Scorpions retiring after 30+ years, but I'm glad they have left us with these great recordings.",1323820800,7,1552,4.4070175438596495

I loved the cd the first time I heard it, some time ago, but since I bought this package a week ago I love this piece even more. I have to say I expected a darker ambient to the whole show (a little bit too colorful for my taste) but the great thing in here is the music. Excellent versions of a bunch of really good songs (I have to say thank you for Love of my Life from my favourites, Queen). It is a shame you don't get to listen to the cellist except in Dust in the Wind, but I guess what you wantto hear is Klaus' voice and Schenker's guitar playing, along with a great formation of musicians that, not so known, give a lot of feeling and good playing to the whole set.
