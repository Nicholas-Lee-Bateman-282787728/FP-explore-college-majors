8345491,5,B001V6X11W,Who would've thought Wesley Snipes could produce such a great documentary. John Henrik Clarke is one of our greatest historians. He's walked with Malcolm and Kwame Nkrumah. He had so much knowledge until even after he went blind from glaucoma he could still teach. And he could tell you the sources of his teachings so there would be no mistaking the authenticity. This is a most wonderful piece and it needs to be available to the public.,1393286400,3,439,4.714285714285714
