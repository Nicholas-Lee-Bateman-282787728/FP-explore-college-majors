Most hackneyed plot, rife with cliches such as Asians in massage parlors, human trafficking, guy with ptsd. Actually no plot at all. Any 2 year could have solved this mystery given a postcards with massage parlor address on it.",1515888000,,300,4.788461538461538
8171672,4,B000MT7XP4,"There are some who would think this is a unrealistic movie.....but action crime thrillers don't need have a plot based in reality to make them worthy of our time. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the protagonist work his way through his ""panic attacks."" Again, not the most realistic portrayal of how someone works through crippling panic attacks but it works in this movie. I also enjoyed the character development between the two lead characters. A good distraction for a rainy day home sick!",1513209600,,491,5.0

Unfortunately that would not have given us this pretty cool little movie.

The plot is essentially what you think it will be, but that is actually O.K.. For once, the nice guy actually wins... kinda :)

p.s.: none of the other comments appear to relate in any way to this movie, a PTSD suffering rock critic plays the James Stewart role in this London based spin off Rear Window.",1509235200,,571,4.471153846153846
8171674,5,B000MT7XP4,"This movie is unknown to most, and most boring simpletons may dismiss it, but for those who have a deeper level of thinking and artistic vission this is a gem. The soundtrack is hypnotic and nostalgic and the time lapse photography is brilliant.  The story is odd and dosnt seem to have a plot at first glance, but thats where you need to use your brain and figure out what is trying to be said. The Great Reg Evans and Richard Moir are a great odd couple pair in this forgotten artistic expression of how we are controlled as a species by the higher powers among us.",1358208000,,567,4.299065420560748
8171675,5,B000MT7XP4,"I first saw this movie on an airplane. Despite my thought that it was some low budget shlock, I decided to buy the headphones anyway. (It was a long flight!)
I am glad I did. This movie is tightly written and superbly cast and acted. Themes of familial obligation, midlife crisis, and one's legacy upon the people around them are woven into a tight suspense story.
You will be glad you bought this film.",1065916800,,403,4.45945945945946
