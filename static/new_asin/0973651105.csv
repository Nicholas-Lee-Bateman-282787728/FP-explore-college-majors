7794560,4,0973651105,"Wingfield Unbound is a one-man stage play featuring the comedy of Dan Needles, delivered on stage by Rod Beattie. Don't worry if you haven't heard of Rod Beattie; many people haven't. The 'Letters from Wingfield Farm' series are one-man plays based upon the character of Walt Wingfield, a successful big city stockbroker who retires to the country believing he can become a successful farmer. The plays are constructed around the various characters in the community that Walt falls in with, some wise as Solomon and some dumber than sticks.

In every play, all the characters are played by Rod Beattie. Although this may appear strange at first, it quickly becomes one of the appealing aspects of each play. ""Wingfield Unbound"" is the 4th in the series.

In ""Wingfield Unbound"" Walt proposes to turn an old grist mill into a history museum but discovers it is supposedly haunted. Being an outsider, he dismisses this story and pushes ahead undaunted. But sometimes there is foundation to the locals' fears.

You will enjoy Beattie's talents as he plays the wise and silly characters of the community.",1235865600,,1100,5.0
