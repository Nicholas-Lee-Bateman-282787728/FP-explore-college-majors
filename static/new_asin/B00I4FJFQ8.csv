6251102,5,B00I4FJFQ8,"This is a brilliant movie.

It's not cliche, or generic.  It's novel.  There is ultraviolence and gore, portrayed in a novel fashion by people who know how to do it well.

This is not a typical horror movie.  And it contains more than a little touches of sci-fi.

But it's a gem.",1445299200,,279,4.269230769230769

6251104,1,B00I4FJFQ8,"I loved Adam chaplin,  and really enjoy the art style violence of this new horror genre. HOWEVER,
 this movie is soo thin in story line, plot, acting.  That you will be so confused on what is happening, why its happening, and why you should even care. For me the answer was , I didn't care and won't care to ever watch it again. I wanted to like this movie but I require more from a film than just creative visceral violence.",1432771200,,425,4.222222222222222
6251105,3,B00I4FJFQ8,"I picked this one up after finding out it was made by the same group that did Adam Chaplin: Violent Avenger (which I loved).  If I was rating this strictly as a movie, I would probably give it one star.  Not really much of a story, more like an fx demo linked together with a (very) loose narrative.  What was up with the chick on the cover taking her helmet off before EVERY fight scene, only to put it back on again? Also, WAY too many filler scenes that go on way too long...
I can't bring myself to give it one star though.  Some very impressive digital effects in this one, some awesome gore shots, a weird worldview, and more visual style than just about anything else I've seen lately just makes the non-story that much more frustrating.
I really hope these guys keep trying and make a real  movie soon - they have a lot of talent, they just need to polish up their storytelling.",1429747200,3,886,4.281437125748503

6251108,1,B00I4FJFQ8,"I was very excited to have ordered this movie after truly loving De Santi's delirious revenge gore extravaganza ""Adam Chaplin: Violent Avenger."" I am noting that the first reviewer who posted here gives this woefully inferior movie 5 stars! And why do they give it it five stars? Oh, because it has SO MUCH GORE! Gimmee a break! Who the hell cares? Horror movies have been gory for 40 years. The Evil Dead and It's update from 2 years ago are gory. The Thing from 1982 is gory. Hostel II is gory. Cannibal Holocaust is visceral and disgusting. Movies like Street Trash and the original Toxic Avenger use similar effects minus the CGI add-ons. PEter Jackson's DEADALIVE is at least 20 years old now! What do those movies have that Taeter City doesn't have? A SCRIPT! I can only assume that the person who gave this movie 5 stars just sits around with a voluminous collection of crap horror movies and when there is a gore effect giggles and thinks, ""Nifty!"" like a blithering idiot.

Here are some major problems with Taeter City:

There is literally no story beyond the basic Sci-fi dystopia background of the movie. If you read the description on back of the DVD case, that's the PLOT not the STORY. Because beyond a repetitive series of animated cartoon segments that comment on this Soylent Green like government, this concept has really no connection to any plot point, development, story arc or resolution that happens in the movie. The animated segments are supposed to act as satire, but is painfully obvious after the 3rd one they are acting as filler.

There are only two actors and no characters in the movie. That's right, there are only 2 actors: De Santi, who plays the hunted monstrosity (and has NO lines or dialogue!) and Monica Muniz who must be someone's girlfriend. All other actors (with an exception of 2 or 3 people) are played by masked extras who act as gore set pieces. These are not the grotesque prosthetic masks they used in Adam Chaplin to create these kind of barbaric, degenerate characters that Adam Chaplin fights in that movie. What we have here is countless extras in hockey masks, pigs faces, biker helmets, skull masks. We have whole scenes of henchmen dialogue being spoken thru masks where there are no lips or facial features present. This has an incredibly distancing affect on the viewer. You feel you are watching a movie comprised completely of voiceovers! And because almost everyone is in a mask, the kills seem like nothing. There are no people, no actors behind there. It's completely empty as a viewing experience.

We cannot say anything morally about the nature of this endeavor. Who is the hero? Certainly not De Santi's character. It is made clear he is a mutated person who is now going about killing 100's of people. He doesn't even work as an anti-hero. He has no motivation, story arc, history or background. And certainly not the agents of the government, who medically experiment and execute people with horrible torture devices. There is nobody to identify with in this movie.

The satirical aspects are WEAK. Troma does this much better than this movie ever could. The satire, once again, is not employed in any meaningful way in relationship to the plot. Two good examples of sci-fi satire that relates to the actual tone and events of a movie would be Robcop and Starship Troopers. You can do this with a big budget or no budget. It's the script.

Where is the original language track? The movie (unlike the DVD of Adam Chaplin) is dubbed entirely in english. Was it too expensive to have the original language track with English subtitles then a second dubbed track? I doubt it. This is very distracting for the few scenes where we can actually see someone's lips move and it is horrible dubbing! It makes you think that this is why 90% of all the characters are behind masks or have no dialogue. Maybe De Santi was trying to construct it for the international market where they could dub in any language over the movie.

The authoring of the DVD has a ratio issue. There are many commercial and animated segments with type where letters are consistently cut off at the corners of the screen.

The movie is disjointed, has no narrative, story arc or real ending. It is merely a Necrostorm effects reel. There are literally dozens of horror movies  that come to VOD every month now. You could watch something with an interesting concept and fun production design like ""Frankenstein's Army."" Something clever and fun: ""Housebound."" Something reasonably gory and ambitious, ""Starry Eyes."" Something repellent and gonzo, ""I Saw the Devil."" Something subversive and stylish, ""Strange Color of Your Bodies Tears."" Not to mention all these peripheral horror movies like, 'Cheap Thrills"" ""Big Bad Wolves"" and  ""Blue Ruin."" There's 50 horror movies you could watch before this. Five Stars because you want to mislabel it a B-movie and it's gory? Please. You crap on the intelligence of horror fans.

I'm totally willing to seek out another De Santi film, but he's going to have to do better than just stringing together a bunch of gore vignettes that his studio can create.",1424822400,15,5128,4.783050847457627
6251109,5,B00I4FJFQ8,"I haven't seen the other Taeter movie, but this one surpassed my expectations.  This is a gore movie with lots of crazy fake/cheap special effects that are impressive for a low budgeted movie.  Don't expect character depth, just carnage.  Police go after super weird cannibal guy that can do even crazier stuff, and that's the story basically.  Fun carnage, though.  Lots of poking at the meat and fast food industry as well.  Would've like a few more extras.",1424822400,2,459,4.82051282051282

6251111,4,B00I4FJFQ8,"Pretty cool aesthetic. Interesting creative decisions. The commercials work really well in establishing and normalizing the atmosphere of taeter city, giving the gore an air of everyday happenstance. It is very derivative of Japanese films like Tokyo Gore Police but I still thought it was fairly decent. Would have benefitted from a larger budget, albeit the cheapness sometimes works in its favor.",1448323200,,399,5.451612903225806
6251112,3,B00I4FJFQ8,"Why did I watch this movie? I have no idea. But I found myself fascinated by it. I really can't tell if the director is a genius or insane.  Perhaps he's a little bit of both. But what he was able to accomplish with old toys and cheap computer graphics was quite simply, amazing.  Not that they looked real but it dif show a technical skill that left me impressed.
The story was just a crazy, hyper mess but also very compelling.  The acting was horrible yet when they ""Biker police"" wore their helmets and the voice overs were dubbed in, the acting seemed very believable.  Not Oscar worthy of course, but still enjoyable.
The blood and gore was Everywhere.  But it was both fun and horrific at the same time. The director seemed to have so much fun with this movie. And in the end that is what movie's are about.",1447632000,,814,4.328947368421052

6251117,1,B00I4FJFQ8,"This movie tries to be special effects driven, but the effects aren't that well done and while Michael Bay can get away with a thin plot mashed together with extravagant special effects, this movie's plot is simply non existent with no real exposition as to what is happening and why. The movie tries to jam too much sci-fi futuristic lingo as a means of exposition, but saying some science sounding words in a row together don't make a coherent sentence. As someone who actively watches and enjoys lower budget ""bad"" movies, this was too mind numbing to finish.",1446076800,,562,4.744897959183674

8639254,3,B00I4FJFQ8,"Taeter City: City of Cannibals is really a showcase of special effects, if anything else. The plot and characters are paper thin, not much other than criminals in a futuristic dystopian city are turned into food which is then distributed to various fast food places across the city, and its premise runs pretty tedious very early on. Yet, that's not to say I didn't have a fun time watching it, as there are special effects-gore-dismemberment-a-plenty to keep things somewhat interesting, especially if that's up your alley.
