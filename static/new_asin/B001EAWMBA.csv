8297303,5,B001EAWMBA,"Every Bible-believing Christian should not only watch this production, but really examine what the Lalonde brothers have to say. It's hard to argue with anything they suggest and, though some may find them to be a li'l ""quirky"", they have really put together information that aligns with bible information. Furthermore, the depth of insight and foresight they demonstrate is impressive and admirable. Without a doubt, they have done their homework and the presentation of facts, quotes, scriptures of this 12 year old production are still timely for today. We are conservative Christians who do not ascribe to the ""name it; claim it"" or ""word of faith"" ideologies. Please, if you believe in the Lord Jesus, watch this, examine its contents, and compare it to what the Bible, particularly, REVELATION, has to say.",1250035200,4,812,5.159090909090909
