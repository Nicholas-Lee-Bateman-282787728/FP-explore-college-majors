2430504,5,B000BNX5AI,"This is a great concert special. Only the great Carly Simon would think of doing something as hip as a concert on the Queen Mary2! The production values are superb. The dancers are beautiful (great choreography and staging btw!), the back up singers superb and the band is fantastic. Carly's performance is top notch. We don't get to see her very often and this DVD is a rare treat for any Carly Simon fan. Carly Simon is a national treasure.",1132617600,6,442,4.5375

2430511,5,B000BNX5AI,"This is a charming and entertaining DVD presentation of a concert recorded on the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship.

Ms Simon presents an excellent performance, including her well known hits as well as covering timeless standards.

In between, there are vignettes featuring a tour of the ship, including Ms Simon visiting the bridge and the galley.

For fans, this is well worthwhile, as well as being entertains for a broader audience,",1475798400,,428,5.0
2430512,5,B000BNX5AI,"Although some of her big hits were performed, Carly Simon really shines in the ballroom dance songs.  It opened up a new side to her that I never knew, and the video clips throughout the Queen Mary were very enjoyable.  I disagree with the reviewer that said she seemed nervous; I thought she seemed extremely relaxed and smooth, admitting that her voice was starting to crackle towards the end of the show and laughing about it.  This DVD is pure Carly and I loved it, hoarse voice at the end and all;) Must-have for Carly collectors.",1474934400,,535,4.552083333333333

2430526,5,B000BNX5AI,"I have always loved the standards but in this show Carly just shows what a truly wonderful performer she really is by lifting songs like moonlight serenade , ive got you under my skin and the georgous all the things you are to a whole new level. Carly is the consummate artist  as she not only pays tribute to the great songwriters of the past but she also performs her own hits such as the very underated you belong to me a song she co-wrote with Michael McDonald the lovely coming around again nobody does it better and of course her signature tune Youre so vain. All in all I absolutely love this dvd and thoroughly recommend it ta any lover of good music but before I forget I should mention the band which is excellent and Carlys daughter Sally as one of her back up singers and the acoustic set they do together after the main show.....fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!",1401753600,2,862,4.455696202531645

2430530,3,B000BNX5AI,"""Carly Simon-A Moonlight Serenade On The QM2"" was alright & liked the majority of the songs + seeing & hearing Carly sing with her daughter was nice.

2430534,3,B000BNX5AI,I noticed Carly's voice waver at times but man she still looks HOT! Loved the interspersed visits she made aboard ship but wish she had stuck more to her own hits rather than the droll old-timey mush that prevailed. I prefer the Martha's Vineyard dvd.,1331078400,,251,4.6

2430536,3,B000BNX5AI,"I think the last time I saw Carly was on a SNL season 1 dvd, so...  I was sort of expecting her lilting young Carly voice singing in that rich tone she had in her early career.  What this DVD exposed (to me anyway), was an aged voice about an octave lower than I was used to.  A little rough and worn.  But it was okay.  It was me who wasn't used to it.  She used to perform barefoot and from what I could tell, she still does.  Enjoy.",1305244800,,435,3.8202247191011236
2430537,3,B000BNX5AI,"There are good things about this DVD - Carly sounds good, the venue is attractive, the video is good. However, a couple of things really weigh it down for me. First, there are not a lot of Carly Simon songs here. Most of the songs are covers. Second, all the songs, even Carly Simon's, are cast into more of a big band style. This is not intrinsically bad, just not what I was expecting or prefer.",1287619200,,397,4.2368421052631575

The song are sooooo great.  You've got to buy it.  Oh yeah the extras on it feature her just playing the guitar and singing.  It's good.",1255478400,,300,4.12280701754386

2430541,2,B000BNX5AI,I was hoping for her more of her previous hits. It was a lot of songs that I'm not familiar with. Her concert from Grand Central Station was a lot better.,1220227200,,154,4.0
2430542,5,B000BNX5AI,"When I bought the album this DVD is based on,I couldn't stop playing it. From ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE to the title track, I was smitten by the perfect blend of the instruments with her gorgeous contralto voice. When I got the DVD something similar happened, as I was taken into a trance by Carly's great command of the stage and her voice live. For someone who has experienced stage fright,she delivers with flying colors. Savor the old pop songs along with the standards. You will end up under the moonlight singing along with a special someone and a bottle of wine .Will you finish listening to it or love will take over?",1216166400,,622,4.464912280701754
2430543,5,B000BNX5AI,"I loved her choice of songs and the setting on the Queen Mary. Awesome background video for a party.  Both video and audio are excellent quality.
Carly looks incredible - and if she went to the salon her hair would look great too!",1214438400,,230,4.348837209302325
2430544,5,B000BNX5AI,"...to convey just how fabulous this disc is. What we have here is a live performance, essentially of the 2005 ""Moonlight Serenade"" album, but with the very happy addition of some old favorites. [I still think ""The More I See You"" is as good as anything she's ever done]. Carly is said to suffer severe stage fright, so her long career hasn't given us a lot of live recorded performance. Sad, and all the more reason to be grateful for this....

Carly is in absolutely prime, perfect voice throughout. Both her own work and that of the masters of the Great American Songbook receive performances for the ages. I don't know how many evenings this was sung over...Carly changes outfits several times, but it still could have been only one show.

Carly is a miracle. I just gave a well-earned five star review to a Natasha Bedingfield DVD...I said she is sexy...she is...she is around 25, and sexy girls of 25 are common--see any mall. I have said that Diana Krall is sexy--to the max; sexy 40 year olds are not overly rare. Now...watch this DVD...one of the sexiest music videos one can imagine, though absolutely clean, and in perfect taste. Carly was 60 when this was made. 60. OK...I've had a vicarious crush on Carly for years. Allow for it. Fans will already have this; if you're not, you should be. Enjoy.",1212883200,,1308,4.609442060085837
2430545,5,B000BNX5AI,Just a wonderful concert on QM2! The program and song selections were very appropriate. Totally enjoyable!,1208822400,,106,5.6875
2430546,5,B000BNX5AI,"I have watched this DVD in the evening many times(perfect for relaxing) and never tire of listening to Carly's  beautiful voice and her stylistic renditions of the classics from her Moonlight Serenade album.  Also fascinating is the selection of songs so beautifully done by her daughter Sally and Carly in the Commodore Club of this fabulous ship!  (They are sitting in a window with the sea rolling by as they are singing).  It is moving to witness the closeness of this mother and daughter and the musical talents of each. They are truly blessed in this and many ways--including their physical beauty!

I also enjoyed Carly's tour of the ship which is interspersed with the performance. I witnessed the Queen Mary leaving from San Francisco and the ship is a thing of beauty!

Carly's performance of her major hits such as ""Jesse"",""You""re So Vain"" ""You Belong to Me"", ""Nobody Does It Better"" is simply fantastic!  What a talent!  I'd love to see more DVD's from this talented, elegant,  and intelligent woman.",1196035200,,1012,4.871345029239766
2430547,5,B000BNX5AI,"Experience the romance that is Queen Mary 2 and let Carly Simon bedazzle you with her great performances that are all radiantly engaging and elegantly hip as you watch this DVD, a must-have for Carly Simon fans.

After the tremendous success of her lovely CD ""Moonlight Serenade,"" this remarkable DVD, ""A Moonlight Serenade on the Queen Mary 2"" was produced. The show was elegantly staged at the Ballroom of the biggest cruise ship, Queen Mary 2. Carly Simon is, without a doubt, a total performer. Backed by a 15-piece orchestra conducted by Richard Perry, she showed her great stage presence and her cool and confident performances in this show.

She gives the timeless gem and my all-time absolute favorite ""Moonlight Serenade"" a contemporary approach without losing its traditional and nostalgic flair as the couples - ladies in their best evening gowns and gentlemen in their black ties, dance cheek-to-cheek to their hearts' delight. She performs evergreen favorites ""I've Got You Under My Skin,"" ""Where Or When,"" ""How Long Has This Been Going On,"" ""All The Things You Are,"" ""Moonglow,"" ""I Only Have Eyes For You,"" ""Alone Together"" and ""The More I See You"" in the most beautiful and sophisticated settings.

Also included in the repertoire are songs that leave the truest message of her life such as her original and meaningfully-written compositions ""You're So Vain,"" ""You Belong To Me,"" ""Love of My Life"" and ""Anticipation,"" and not to mention one of her hits but not her original song, ""Nobody Does It Better.""

Also shown are behind-the-scene footages with her daughter Sally Taylor performing duets in ""No Secrets"" and ""Devoted To You."" She is also shown on film clips touring the most famous cruise line, meeting and interviewing the Captain of the ship, and taking a tour at the kitchen and sampling its foods - custards, escargot and pico de gallos. There's also a bonus video of a soft and mellow rendition of ""Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"" showing couples dancing cheek-to-cheek, plus Ms. Simon's photo gallery.

This is an enjoyable DVD and one of the best from my collection. I wholeheartedly recommend it for your viewing pleasure.

 P.S. I like her chic and voguish outfit on the cover. I'll add five more stars!",1185840000,5,2241,4.928381962864721

2430549,3,B000BNX5AI,"I just received ""Into White"" for my Birthday and loved it, by Carly Simon. I then ordered Moonlight Serenade on the QM2 and was disappointed. About the only song I was looking forward to hopefully hearing was ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" which she did really well on GMA, but wasn't included in her repertoire. The Big Band genre of the other songs got increasingly boring and weren't well done...her voice just wasn't as good as it use to be. I guess I was hoping for more of a tour of the QM2 with shots of her singing on the rail or something, or from a lounge chair, but instead all we got was a tour of the Ship's kitchen. She later did some acoustic singing with her adorable daughter in a stateroom. These 4 songs were pretty good.",1173312000,3,736,4.264285714285714
2430550,5,B000BNX5AI,I love this Music DVD. It is great if you want to relax for an hour or more and it is fun to see Carly Simon enjoying the Cruise. I am  giving this DVD as gifts to friends I like it so much.,1173312000,,190,3.4186046511627906

2430553,5,B000BNX5AI,"This DVD is a sheer delight to listen to as well as view. The choice of music is perfect and fits the elegant surroundings of the Queen Mary 2. The videography and the production value of the recording raise the bar for on-location recording. If you're a fan of the ""standards"" you'll love this album. She even throws in a few of her old pop tunes just for good measure. In my book Carly truly is the Queen.",1163203200,7,407,4.230769230769231
2430554,5,B000BNX5AI,I absolutely love the DVD! Carly is awesome! I love the acoustic set. I feel very fortunate to have a piece of history! Carly is one of the best singers still out there. I'm a 19 year old fan of hers. I first started listening to her when I was in diapers. To see her on this DVD just makes it so much better!,1160697600,,309,3.84375
2430555,5,B000BNX5AI,"I can sum up my reaction to this DVD in one word - smile.  That's what I found myself doing throughout this wonderful performance.  Perhaps Carly's voice is not quite what it used to be, but that was never her attraction.  It is now, as it has always been, her uncanny ability to touch our hearts and give us all an intimate insight into the depth and breadth of her perception and emotion.

I loved the old standards from the Moonlight Serenade album, mixed with her own pop hits.  But I think my favorite part was the acoustic set where she sat down with just one guitar player, plus her own, and the backup singers, including her daughter, Sally Taylor.  Carly's duet with Sally on the old fifties song, ""Devoted To You"" was enough to bring tears to your eyes.

My only regret is that I was not there on the Queen Mary II, to witness this memorable event.  Thank goodness someone had the foresight to capture it for the rest of us.",1155254400,14,934,4.358381502890174

2430557,5,B000BNX5AI,"Carly Simon is like a vintage bottle of fine wine... She improves with age.  The venue for this DVD "" The Queen Mary 2"" was a perfect setting.  It allowed Carly to be herself and at the same time present a new and vigorous Carly Simon.  The Arrangements were excellent and the musicans couldn't have been better.

Every note... every word of every lyric was right on key and was a disticnt achievment any vocalist would be proud of. Ms' Simon reached out and touched the hearts of everyone in the magnificent ballroom.  .... and it came through on the DVD as well.

Carly Simon is a PRO in every sense of the word and this DVD is a major accomplishment.  It will bring a whole new genre to further understand and enjoy what true music is.

Stay well Carly..... we want more of the same from you... for a long time.

2430558,5,B000BNX5AI,"Whoever produced this DVD needs to do more.  In short--it was incredible.  Lighting, music, camera angles, extras, everything!!!  I never heard the Big Band songs done this way--elegantly as only Ms. Simon can do it, and with a bit of old charm feel.  In fact, I liked the Big Band music better than her own music from the 1970's and 1980's, although they were great too.  And speaking of bands, the members of her band were almost as much of the show as Carly, especially the bass player and the drummer.  And a bonus--my 6 year old son is now singing Cole Porter and Glen Miller.  I know what I will be giving for birthday presents this year.  Thank you, Carly.",1145145600,3,663,4.421487603305785
2430559,4,B000BNX5AI,"This DVD reminded me that Carly Simon is a great singer. The jazz standards she sang on this album sounded fresh given her distinctinve voice, spot -  on arrangements and talented back up band. She also sang some of her hit popular songs , all with the Queen Mary 2 as a backdrop. Well worth the investment.",1142812800,2,307,4.385964912280702
2430560,5,B000BNX5AI,"A big surprise of this DVD !  Firstly, Carly appeared in excellent shape, looked sexy and sounded superb in voices at the stage in this wonderful QM2.  She performed all her most favourite hits.  Secondly, a salute to the whole live band with all the musicians who contributed their talent in musical performances.  Thirdly, this DVD is a cool live recording with natural sound as closely as you were there in the ballroom.  Lastly, should every woman of 50s be proud of their bodies as good and sexy as Carly's, they have to stand up and say, "" sisters........ """,1142640000,3,563,4.59

She performs a mixture of standards, off her latest release ""Moonlight Serenade"" and also some of her own songs. Nicely filmed and includes some casual clips of Carly on board the QMII. The best treat for Carly fans is the very casual accoustic set recorded very intimately with her daughter Sally, the two other backup vocalists and a guitarist - Very nice!",1141948800,,484,4.914634146341464

She's still in a good shape, the beautiful voice is still there.

It's a jazzy kind of concert mixed with the old themes that we all know e love.

The place is fantastic and the audience unusal, although is a very intimist concert.

It has also an acoustic set (with her daughter Sally) wich i particullary love.

For the person who wrote a negative review.....yes, Carly has aged.  But haven't we all?  Carly does an excellent performance on the QM2.  The elegance of both The Lady and the ship are awe inspiring.

My husband and I are avid cruisers and would have loved to have walked on board and found Carly performing!  The accoustic set is most touching, watching Carly and her daughter.  Each time I watch ""love of my life/devoted to you"" there are tears in my eyes by the end of the song.

We have a collection of over 100 concert DVD's and this one is absolutely, without question my favorite!!!",1139529600,4,619,4.513513513513513
2430572,4,B000BNX5AI,"A perennial favorite since the 70's, its been awhile since

I heard from Carly Simon. This is a nice idea and I like the

meshing of her two styles of music into one show on a boat.

Sure at 60 your vocals aren't like they use to be during the

heydays of youth  but its mean spirited some bash Carly for getting out there and doing this, can't stop time and it

eventually effects even the greats voices but... I'm tried of everything having to be so

perfect all the time.  This is very stylish, warm and entertaining and features

some great ol songs. I'm glad Carly is dealing with stage shyness(she is a natural entertainer just watching this) and involves her daughter and friends, especially the acoustic

set she does which is intimate and touching. Well worth owning.",1136592000,4,776,4.517985611510792
2430573,5,B000BNX5AI,"This DVD is great.  I very much enjoyed the selection of songs, the venue and her voice never sounded better.  Carly has always been on of my absolute faves from the 70s (along with The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, ABBA, Linda Ronstadt, etc.) She looks great and gives a great performance.  You won't be disappointed in this purchase.",1136332800,3,337,4.87719298245614
2430574,5,B000BNX5AI,"I apply that to Carly and to the venue for this concert.

Yes, Carly's voice is different than her recordings. And it shows  in a wonderful, real way. Just like the lady herself there is no artifice.

She has always been an original.

I admit it took a couple of songs to adjust to the deeper register of her vocals. < Not nearly so noticable on the acoustic set> But after that, as comfortable as ever.

I loved the elegance of the QM2.

The orchestra.

The black tie atmosphere.

The acoustic set extra is simply delicious. Carly's voice sounds more ""recording-like"".

Informal, acoustic guitars, Carly's wonderful poetic lyrics, Sally Taylor accompaning her Mom. I love that. It is Carly-Cool.

Carly's Martha's Vineyard DVD is one of my fav's. I will

gladly make room for the QM2 DVD right next to it. And don't expect either one to collect much dust.",1134259200,4,856,4.64
2430575,5,B000BNX5AI,"Having just seen Ms Simon Live in concert any stage fright she use to talk about has to have left her, cause she is one GREAT performer! We can only hope she tours often to make up for all the years she stayed away from the stage. On This Dvd, flimed on the QE2 Carly shines and for those that have never had the chance to see Ms. Simon sing her songs live this is a great chance to.

My Favorite moments are her Acoustic Set (""Love Of My Life"" is my all time favorite Simon song) however her full band treatment of ""Jessie"", ""Your so vain"" and ""COming Around Again"" are close to perfect.",1133740800,22,588,4.113043478260869
2430576,5,B000BNX5AI,"I just received this DVD from Amazon.  This is Carly at her best.  She put her heart and soul into this performance.  Yes, her voice does at times go away, but she is not used to peforming in front of people.  She was even scared that her voice would leave her an admitted it at the beginning of the DVD.  Since 1980, Carly has released many good albums and has not achieved commercial success.  Certainly she deserves it.  This performance on the QM2 was a one-time event that only Carly could do.  Lets see how many artists copy her like they have.  She was the first singer to record standards and then everybody copied her.  Lets give Carly Simon the great she deserves.  In addition to being a great artist, she appears to be a great person too.",1133568000,4,750,4.36231884057971
2430577,5,B000BNX5AI,"This is an outstanding DVD. Carly sings beautiful songs, and her voice is just great. For the reviewer who said that Carly's voice is not good, I am only going to say that there is a difference in Carly's voice if you compare it with how she sang 20 years ago. She has a lower register, but her voice is still vibrant and full of color. She gives a unique emotion to each song. Her phrasing is perfect. And frankly, I don't know any contemporary pop singer who can sing these songs this well.

I agree with another reviewer who said that the acoustic set is a highlight, and Sally Taylor is fantastic.

Overall, this is the best DVD I have bought in years.",1133222400,7,656,4.282258064516129
2430578,2,B000BNX5AI,"I couldn't listen to this DVD anymore. I got to song 14,""Noboody does it better,"" and my ears were hurting SO BAD.My eyes felt great looking at this BEUTIFULL,SEXY artist. ITs unreal Carlys 60,but once she starts singing you will know that. I've been a Carly Simon fan since 1978,and will be for the rest of my life,but I would have NEVER let this DVD be released if I was her. It was like picking a stranger from the croud and having her sing. I've seen Carly live in 1980 when she had her well know breakdown on stage,and that concert was alot better than this one on the Queen Mary 2. If I was at this show,I would have jumped overboard.",1133049600,11,640,4.254098360655738

2430580,5,B000BNX5AI,"As a music lover, I find myself searching for new music and artists all the time. Unfortunately, however, I find myself buying less and less music after hearing a few samples. And even fewer DVD's.

Having said this, this DVD is, by far, the most pleasant and sophisticated production that I have heard -and seen- in a very, very, long time.

Renowned director Jim Gable and music producer Richard Perry have joined forces to create magic of the highest caliber.

Of course, their main ""ingredient"" is Carly Simon, whose beautiful resonant voice, together with her carisma, and a selection of delightful songs, are combined with the majestuosity of the Queen Mary. Add to the cocktail top notch musicians and orchestra, and perhaps you will be picturing what a great treat this is.

Every single moment, and image, is like a wonderful bucolic painting, where each part plays an important role, and the whole is sweet to the senses.

The technical details are also impeccable, from superb surround sound to excellent editing.

Everything here is well done. The highlight of this DVD, is IMHO, the acoustic set, with Carly and her daughter, Sally Taylor, with 2 guitars, playing naturally but with tons of emotion, 5 songs that you, believe me, will remember for a long time.

These are the $ 10 (or about that) that I have invested more wisely this year in terms of art. I would sincerely advise you to give this DVD a try. It is worth it.",1132617600,8,1438,4.728

8089536,5,B000BNX5AI,When I first heard Your so Vain in the early 70's I was immediately entranced and knocked out when I saw what Carly could look like on the cover of No Secrets.`Listened to much of her music on and then in the early 90's got Her Greatest Hits Live I believe it was but really locked on to Coming Around Again especially the performance with the littler children chorus she used on that performance. So much respected her all the time since and then needed to buy an item to get free shipping on over 25 dollar order and was going to get the Martha's Vineyard DVD but then saw this as it was much cheaper and just what I needed dollar wise. My wife and I put it on tonight and well..........I think miss Simon can sing the phonebook and I would be into it.........just gorgeous and you know the people in the crowd were high rollers of some type and bet it cost some huge money to get into it. Fabulous musicians all through including her daughter Sally Taylor singing backup and playing guitar so If you like music that will relax you yet you find yourself tapping your foot then get this. Marvelous picture as well..........very tastefully done.,1521504000,,1145,4.431279620853081

8089541,5,B000BNX5AI,"Okay, I will try and make this as simple as possible. You're on a cruise ship. No, not any ordinary cruise ship - you're on the Queen Mary 2, Cunard Lines and all that. No, there are no sliding/diving boards for the kids or grandma. Once again, you're on the Queen Mary 2. Okay, you got it?

Next, for your dining and entertainment pleasure, they have hired someone named Carly Simon to sing for you. No, this is no ""has been"" performer who was picked up in Miami at the last moment before the cruise departed, who had a few gigs with so-and-so back in New Jersey in the 1950s or '60s. THIS IS CARLY SIMON! Okay, picture getting clearer?

Now, add or combine the two. Let's review: CARLY SIMON plus the CUNARD LINES must be equal to some ""dang-ed"" great performance to use a parlance that I think we may all understand. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a DVD/video of Bryan Ferry or some such ""modern crooner"" doing the same thing as Carly? Gee, I don't know. I guess we'll just have to live with this video from Carly. OKAY, I COULD DO THAT! CAN YOU?

Thanks, Carly! I truly wonder what your family life must have been like growing up in Upstate New York. Thanks for your memories, because I am certain that they coincide with the memories of many others. Now, throw all that together in a grown-up way and add the elegance and setting of the QM2, and you have one heckuva DVD!

For those of you too young to understand this, well, there's always Ariana Grande.

Thanks, Carly!",1497571200,,1479,4.363636363636363
