1433007,5,B00005JK5O,"A Life in Pictures is a superb and much needed documentary of the legendary filmmaker, Stanley Kubrick.  The film follows the traditional format for biographical documentaries and starts with Kubrick's youth and his early influences.  It progresses steadily through all of his films and finally to his death.  The thing about this documentary, about one of the worlds most reclusive and misunderstood filmmakers, that makes it so good is the insight into his personal life, provided by his wife, Christiana Kubrick.  I think that she understood some of the things that the fans would really be looking for in this film, and that is to say the glimpsing into the kind of man that Kubrick really was, behind the camera or at home.  There are lots of great interviews and the film is very tasteful and respectfully done.  This is definately one for the fans, but those who are just curious will also enjoy it.  Thank you Christiana Kubrick for sharing this DVD with the fans.",1080086400,21,972,4.819277108433735
1433008,5,B00005JK5O,"STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES is as good a documentary as one can make, especially about a master film director like Kubrick. Dealing with his life from growing up in the Bronx to his last days making and refining EYES WIDE SHUT, LIFE IN PICTURES has interviews with cast members, production crew, writers, composers, etc. Jack Nicholson, Malcolm McDowell, Shelley Duvall, Tom Cruise among others are the actors interviewed. Wendy Carlos, musician who orchestrated the classical music in CLOCKWORK ORANGE, is also interviewed, as is Jan Harlan (producer and brother-in-law), Christina Kubrick (Kubrick's wife and a painter), Gyorgy Ligeti (composer's music used in many Kubrick films), and many more invaluable interviews.
There are also clips from every single Kubrick production, comments and revelations (particularly about CLOCKWORK's controversy in Great Britain), reaction from critics like Richard Schickel and other film directors such as Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese, and so much more. Anyone who is a Kubrick fan cannot be without this 21/2 hour documentary...invaluable only skims the surface, it is essential.",995846400,37,1130,5.575581395348837

I also recomend, ""The Boxes of Stanley Kubrick"" by Ron Johnson. Not a thorough analysis by any means it is none the less engrossing. It got a 4.5 out of 10 on IMDb for some reason. Sadly, for an impatient cinephile like myself, the detailed analysis of Kubrick's films remain in the realm of the written word.

1433092,4,B00005JK5O,"This book does a very good job at providing an overview of Kubrick the artist and his films. It starts off with his childhood and how his passion for photography served him well throughout his career. It also shows how he was a prodigy as a photographer. At 16 he had managed to sell one of the photographs he had taken to Look magazine, one of the nations leading picture magazines (a competitor of Life magazine). The viewer learns how his father had such confidence in him that he cashed in his life insurance to finance his first film. The viewer also learns how Kubrick was uncompromising and perfectionist in his art. It was his way or the highway. No comprimise whatsoever. Kubricks style of filmmaking is also examined. That was basically that Kubrick had full control of his films, from the properties he bought, to the filming through editing. He basically controlled every aspect of his film. The only notable exception was Spartacus. All and all a very good introduction to Kubrick the artist and his films.

However, the documentary does have a few problems that prevent this from being a five star film. One is that many of the talking heads are added only for purposes of making the documentary more marketable. Most have nothing of value to say. There are a few, however, that do. Not surprisingly they are filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, who comment on how Kubricks cinema graphic style and originality. Arthur C. Clark also offers insights into how it was like to work with Kubrick and insights into his personality from that perspective (i.e., Kubricks perfectionism, lack of compromise, hard work ethic, etc.). Most of the talking heads say nothing of value though.

The documentary also has a few other significant weaknesses. It misses the fact that Kubrick was introverted and shy despite the fact that he was very forceful, personality wise, behind the camera. It also misses the fact that he was probably autistic (albeit only to a minor degree). It also misses the role that his childhood hobbies of literature and chess played in his role as a filmmaker. It is mentioned that he liked chess in the documentary but not how chess, in Kubricks words, trained him to think a few moves ahead while making films and not concentrate on just the immediate.

In short, despite these weaknesses, a highly recommended documentary. This reviewer also recommends, Paul Duncans book Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films. This book provides an excellent supplement to this documentary in terms of missing gaps as well as providing a slightly better survey of Kubricks films and Kubrick the artist (five stars for that book versus four for this documentary).",1425340800,,2669,4.900442477876106

1433151,5,B00005JK5O,"This presentation, narrated by Tom Cruise, starts out with the standard who was Kubrick as a child. As we travel through his early life it looks like this is getting ready to be a boring standard soundbite General Information presentation.

Then the about the time they get around to explaining Stanley Kubrick through his movie ""How I learned to love the bomb"" we finally get the documentary that we were hoping to see. In other presentations most of these films have their own descriptions of the purpose of the films and what they are trying to say. In this presentation we get to find out what everybody thinks Stanley is trying to say; so we get to look at the same films but this time through Stanley's eyes instead of a sterile film explanation.

So what we have here is exactly what the title implies. We learn about Stanley Kubrick through his pictures and on top of the Tom Cruise narration we get information from family, colleagues, and other sources.

1433216,4,B00005JK5O,"While this documentary is celebratory in tone, focusing on the gripping images created by a great filmmaker, this is not just a ""puff piece."" It is a biography, but one that focuses on Kubrick's work and on his life only insofar as it illuminates that work. It doesn't seek to debunk or demystify Kubrick, but doesn't aim to make him a saint either. It does attempt to debunk the myth - likely created by journalists who resented that they had no access to him - that he was a crazy hermit, that he hated people, that he hated women. Just a careful and methodical filmmaker with a very clear and complex vision of human beings and what they are capable of and what drives them that he attempted to communicate primarily through images and sounds, in a series of films in which he refused to repeat himself. It shows him as a devoted family man, reclusive but not crazy, not a misanthrope and a close friend to many, but one careful not to make his private life public, and certainly a perfectionist, sometimes impatient, but above all an artist whose images will live on long after him. The film strikes a very nice balance between narration, talking heads of those who worked with him and filmmakers who admired him, archival and behind the scenes footage, and sequences from the films themselves. The music, like that in all of his films, is very well chosen. A very inspiring documentary, that would serve as an excellent introduction to his life and work for someone who'd only seen a few of his films and was a nice refresher for someone, like me, who has seen most of them and read a few of the books as well. My teenagers, who'd only seen 2001 and Spartacus, liked the film as well, and, given that they'd wanted to see it with me that while it doesn't feel at all censored it doesn't include any of the more graphic sexual bits from, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Clockwork-Orange/dp/B004O26LAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Clockwork Orange</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eyes-Wide-Shut/dp/B0013D8LKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eyes Wide Shut</a>.

1433238,5,B00005JK5O,"Love him or hate him, the late film director Stanley Kubrick had a very unique voice in 20th Century film cinema. From Dr Strangelove, to 2001 A Space Odyssey, to A Clockwork Orange, to The Shining to his final film Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick displayed a wide, epic scope and breadth to his stories. They weren't just films, they were events. Not many people liked or maybe understood his overall directing tactics or his overdrawn style, and sometimes that even included the people he worked with on his movies, but at the exact same time, you ended up respecting and deeply admiring his vision.

I grew up watching 2001 on tv as a kid, and for the life of me, I'm still hard pressed to say I completely get it, but I love the visuals and the audacity he had to at least create it, and I love it in spite of myself, and I deeply admire and love the nihilistic attitude of Strangelove and Clockwork, the brutality of war shown in Full Metal Jacket, the twisty turns and bizarre revelations of a supposedly solid marriage in Eyes Wide Shut, and his untimely death in 1999 saddens me and others because we're left wondering what other stories he mightve had planned to tell. One thing's for sure...there'll never be another voice quite like his.",1302480000,4,1240,4.535714285714286

This 140-minute long feature delves into the director's past (his involvement with Look Magazine), the films he has directed (and the dedications that went into them), and the controversies surrounding him and his films (the violent content in A Clockwork Orange, the sexual innuendo in Lolita). This movie is very detailed, and it should please those who love Kubrick's works. The interviews by various filmmakers, film critics, and even family members are really something worth watching. It's a marvelously well-made documentary about one of cinema's most inventive filmmakers.

Who was Stanley Kubrick?What forces motivated his cinematic brilliance?Is it something anyone needs to know? None of those questions are hard to answer in simple sentences. So the best that could be done on this documentary,narrated by Tom Cruise is to examine what was known about him:his early life,marriage and most importantly stories about his classic films as told by the actors,directors and composers. By the end everyone from Jack Nicholson to Wendy Carlos and even Cruise himself have a whole collection of tales about what the movie making experience was like with Kubrick. One of the most interesting parts of this is of course the biggest selling point:archival film footage of Stanley on the set of some of his films and even with his family. Hollywood legend is filled with a lot of talk of Kubrick as reclusive,demanding and difficult and you can even see in some footage with Shelly Duval and even two of his daughters who,even for such a quiet voiced man how he could have his whimsical notions of passion and fussiness. Even still they were expressed not as hostility but either as the natural function of a director looking for the right quality for his films or just someone trying to make a clear point.

Even though the focus is always more on his films a lot really is actually revealed about who he was through them. Few American filmakers outside maybe Orson Wells have a directorial style and overall quality that is as uniqely their own as Kubrick's. Even though,unlike Wells Kubrick could not add ""actor"" to his list of different talents the look and feeling of his films always made it more or less seem that Kubrick,as enigmatic as he was WAS in fact an actor in his films in terms of the cinematic qualities he made so distinctive. This documentary will not only draw you to his work you may have missed but point out that,the more you see them you realize how each becomes a different film each time because they can hit you in a different way because the general concepts of many of his films are so variable. Considering that Kubrick got his start as an ameatur photographer and filmaker,and that I myself am a longtime photographer just now getting seriously interested in move making to an extent this documentary really shines a light on some of the simple little qualities:lighting,sound,music and the careful placing of dialog that can really work to make a good film brilliant,if in the right hands. And it will bring you as much to a certain place as a genuine Kubrick film itself will,and in the same manner too still leave you with no open and shut resolution.

1433279,4,B00005JK5O,"This is more of a polite remembrance by family, co-workers, and fellow directors than a critical commentary on Kubrick the man or director. It certainly succeeds in giving us a snapshot or two from Kubrick's family album and allowing us a glimpse of Kubrick the family man as opposed to Kubrick the filmaking machine, but I think whats missing is a sense of what makes him so unique as a director. A lot of people mention things like his unique use of tracking shots in Paths of Glory, and in The Shining but this doc is light on analysis and really sheds very little light on the reasons for Kubrick's massive & lasting impact on cinema.

I am a huge fan of Kubricks films. I count Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001, A Clockwork Orange, & The Shining as among my favorite films. Buts its very difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes a Kubrick film such a singular thing. I suppose what makes Lolita, Strangelove, Clockwork & The Shining so good is that, along with Kubrick being at the top of his game, these films also happen to feature excellent actors at the top of their game. One cannot imagine Strangelove without Peter Sellers or George C. Scott or Slim Pickens; one cannot imagine Clockwork without Malcolm McDowell; and one cannot imagine The Shining without Jack Nicholson. But some of the other films feature actors that seem poorly chosen. Ryan O'Neal was simply a bad cast for Barry Lyndon, and Tom Cruise was perhaps an odd choice to play the lead in Eyes Wide Shut. What this tells me is that even if everything else about a film is brilliantly conceived, if the actors aren't right the film just doesn't work. Thats obvious enough I suppose, but its especially obvious on a Kubrick film because there are so few of them, and therefore so much is at stake in each one. I am also tempted to say that the best Kubrick films are the ones that start with the best source material: Nabokov's Lolita, Southern's Dr. Stranglelove, Clarke's 2001, & Burgess' A Clockwork Orange. I think theres certainly an argument to be made there.

But what makes a Kubrick film a Kubrick film to me (and this quality is in both his most successful & least successful work) is the feeling that he is both a classicist & a nihilist at the same time. He is a classicist in that he values objectivity, the cold detached look that a cold detached thing like a camera can give. And he is a nihilist and by this I mean that his work conveys the idea that as humans we may try to assign meaning to things but that ultimately these attempts amount to nothing. His films are very attractively shot voids or vacuums where human meaning is overwhelmed by a feeling of insignificance. But, there is an undeniable attraction and beauty in Kubrick's vision. And a usefulness for it. Like going outside on a very cold day, it keeps the mind sharp.

But that kind of analysis/conjecture is not what you get with this documentary. What is here that is valuable and that maybe slightly changed my view of Kubrick is that Kubrick, although often viewed as a recluse, seems to have been at his best when most in touch with the popular imagination. Though the documentary doesn't really say anything negative about Kubrick, I couldn't help thinking that what made the later films less successful was the fact that the later ones were made by a man who was no longer in touch with the popular imagination. (By the way Truffaut has some fascinating things to say about the connection between an artists and the publics imagination.) For instance, I've grown to appreciate Eyes Wide Shut, but its certainly not a film that endears itself in any way, nor makes any attempt to connect with the viewer, in any way. Most people that do like the film tend to offer their interpretation of what Kubrick is doing in the film and make an argument for it. I suppose I remain unconvinced about the arguments I've heard about Kubrick's intention and the ultimate meaning of the film. I think possibly its a film about an artist meditating on the distance that art places between himself and actual life. Perhaps.

This documentary was made essentially to try and alter the publics perception of Kubrick, and it maybe accomplishes this PR goal. But I think theres a much deeper documentary to be made that explores the relationship between the art and the life and gives equal attention to each. For me this documentary is too reverent, and there's way too little analysis. It does not dig deep enough into the mind behind the films or the films themselves so it leaves one feeling vaguely dissatisfied.",1213401600,4,4568,4.62192118226601
1433280,5,B00005JK5O,"This is an absolutely fascinating documentary, not only for Kubrick afficinados, but for fans of art, cinema, and life itself.  It's a very well made, entertaining, informative, and surprising film.  The press/critics were fond of painting Kubrick with a massive brush, saying he was a nutcase/recluse who was afraid of germs and flies.  It simply was never true.  Kubrick just never liked talking to the press.  That means he's quite sane and would rather concentrate on his filmmaking and his family.  There's some wonderful home movies of him with his three daughters (especially charming is some footage of them banging away at the piano and instructing their father about life and things), and with his third wife who remained with him until he died, Christianne (a wonderful painter and the actress who sings the beautiful song at the end of Paths of Glory).  There are many, many interviews with actors, technicians, assistants, and even composers.  The most fascinating interview, at least to me, was the modern composer Gyorgy Ligeti, whose music was used in 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut (the piano music in that film was composed by him).  The film, directed by Stanley's brother in law, Jan Harlan (and executive producer on many of his films), really opens the door to show a great artist and a family guy, not some madman screaming at the walls like Howard Hughes (Kubrick was often compared to Hughes by many critics).  I always say the more I read about artists, the more I like them, and this film really is quite wonderful.  I'm also glad that Warner Brothers released this on its own.  Before, it was only available in one of their Kubrick box sets.  For any fan of cinema, you really need to see this one.",1196985600,6,1750,4.793333333333333
1433281,5,B00005JK5O,"Stanley Kubrick is one of those film directors around whom speculation has always swirled.  He was never comfortable in the Hollywood system; he chose, from 1960 until his death in 1999, to live and work in England; he rarely gave interviews; and in comparison to many other filmmakers, including those that admired him, he made relatively few movies.  And yet, it is all those very things that made him a legend in his line of work.  All of that, plus his close-knit family life, are explored in great detail in STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES.

In this lengthy but fascinating documentary made by Kubrick's brother-in-law Jan Harlan, we get to see how Kubrick grew from a budding Bronx-born photographer at Look magazine into his early efforts at filmmaking; his relationship with producer James B. Harris that produced three stunning films (THE KILLING; PATHS OF GLORY; LOLITA); the frustrations of working on SPARTACUS, the only film of his that wasn't firmly under his hand; and the often difficult subject matter he chose to make films about.  Fellow directors Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Alex Cox, and Woody Allen share their thoughts on Kubrick's iconoclastic brand of filmmaking, while collaborators like Michael Herr and Arthur C. Clarke share their experiences on working with him.  And so many others here give us a glimpse into what made Kubrick tick, including his wife Christiane.

This documentary is about as thorough a portrait of a filmmaker as there has ever been, and that's no small feat given how enigmatic Kubrick often seemed to be.  His view of humanity may not have been particularly ideal as he depicted it in his films, but that's because the reality of humanity is itself often not ideal.  And just to think of the wide range of topics the man covered: bizarre love stories (LOLITA; EYES WIDE SHUT); horror (THE SHINING); epic science fiction (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY); political satire (DOCTOR STRANGELOVE); 18th-century manners (BARRY LYNDON); Vietnam (FULL METAL JACKET)...not many filmmakers today, except for the great ones like Spielberg and Scorsese, can boast of such accomplishments in so many different genres and subjects.

Kubrick may no longer be alive, but STANLEY KUBIRCK: A LIFE IN PICTURES ensures that his legacy will be an enduring one for all time.  Highly recommended viewing.",1196035200,7,2336,5.0890052356020945
1433282,5,B00005JK5O,"""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"" was apparently produced as a bonus disc in Warner Home Video's Stanley Kubrick Collection from a few years back, but it's no cheap giveaway. Produced and directed by Jan Harlen, great care was taken to present an overview of the revered auteur's career. With a running time of 142 minutes, it has time for clips from all of Kubrick's films going back to his short, ""The Day of the Fight"" and first feature, ""Fear and Desire,"" to 1999's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" which was released posthumously. There are interviews with assorted Kubrick admirers and cast members, including Marie Windsor of 1956's ""The Killing,"" and Jack Nicholson from ""The Shining."" It provides food for thought, and may even raise some questions for inquisitive viewers.

Nicholson says he had a good time working with Kubrick in ""The Shining,"" but notes he was a completely different director with co-star Shelley Duvall. We then see some intriguing behind-the-scenes footage (from a making-of documentary by Kubrick's daughter included as a bonus on ""The Shining"" DVD) of Kubrick berating Duvall for her performance. ""Do you want mood music?"" he barks. Duvall claims she wouldn't trade the experience for anything, but notes Kubrick's ""cruel"" treatment of her. Was this a form of Method directing? In the film, Duvall is mistreated by her husband throughout, and eventually terrorized and almost murdered by him. Was Kubrick playing her quarrelsome spouse to create the atmosphere of disrespect he thought Duvall needed to convey the proper feeling of terror?

Kubrick worked slowly, spending more than a year filming ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" a rather modest, small-scale drama, and his widow said he wished he had made more films. Martin Scorsese, however, says the 13 feature films Kubrick directed were ""enough."" Kubrick's films are new experiences each time you see them, he said. Sydney Pollock, the director who appeared as an actor in ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" says Kubrick never released a film without controversy. Both ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"" came in for their share of pans, most notably from Pauline Kael, the so-called ""dean of film critics,"" whose wretchedly written review of ""2001"" is briefly spotlighted. Hit the ""STOP"" button on the DVD player, and you can read an excerpt and be amazed at her awful choice of words.

""Ten years later,"" Pollock said, ""they're masterpieces."" And Kubrick's films have remained masterpieces no matter how much time go by.

Kubrick was aware that the expectations were high for a filmmaker who let a full decade pass between releases, as it did with 1987's ""Full Metal Jacket"" and 1999's ""Eyes Wide Shut."" One observer suggests Kubrick was under such pressure with his last film that the relief he felt following the positive reaction it received in a preview for Warner Bros. executives, may have created such a sudden change in his body chemistry that it might have led to his death one week later. Interesting theory, but bear in mind the one offering it is not a physician.

""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"" is must viewing for anyone interested in this fascinating, enigmatic artist.

1433285,5,B00005JK5O,"Who was Kubrick? Few people can answer that question with a certain degree of certitude. After all, Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999) was a very private person, someone who didn t give too many interviews and whose work is often defined as outstanding but ambiguous.

All the same, do not worry. The few people who really knew Kubrick, for example his family and a few close friends, helped to make ""Stanley Kubrick - A Life in Pictures"", an engaging documentary that tells us about his life, influences, films and odd habits. Jan Harlan, the director, was not only his longtime executive producer, but also his brother-in-law.

I certainly doubt that after watching this dvd you will have a clear picture of who Kubrick was, but I am sure you will end up knowing quite a bit more about him and his movies. Furthermore, you will enjoy watching a well-made and highly interesting documentary, that is worth both your time and your money. Heartily recommended!

They say a picture can be worth a thousand words and Kubrick needed more than that, so he moved on into motion pictures. Cinema gave him the chance to really excel and was able to fill every scene with more content than ever believed possible. The images on the screen were like countless thousands of still images and he exploited that to the fullest. Beyond the acting and plot, he embedded symbolism and imagery in his movies as well. With the ability to create that thousand words per image, he went on to create masterpieces, so enigmatic and fascinating, that few have even come close to really understanding his films completely. This is one of the best documentaries that I have seen about him yet. Excellent work!",1483315200,2,844,4.671140939597316
7938840,5,B00005JK5O,"This is a brilliant documentary of the greatest film director of the 20th Century. It is especially fresh, as it was made and released May 2nd, 2001; only 2 years after his death on March 7th, 1999. He had/has no equal. He never made a film of the same genre; please note ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1978) are both about war; the former is an anti-war film and the latter a truly brilliant war film. An IQ said to be well over 200, he took risks no one else would take and virtually all of his films from ""Lolita"" (1961) on were surrounded by controversy. Narrated by Tom Cruise, this takes you from his childhood throughout his life until his death in 1999. It has clips from every film he made, and interviews with actors from each film (whenever possible, as a couple have no living actors). The very revealing interviews are a who's who of directors, actors, cinematographers, writers, producers, etc., plus his family and childhood friends. To name a few, directors like Martin Scorsese, Sydney Pollack, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, actors like Nicholson, Malcolm McDowell (he had the role of a lifetime as the star of ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) numerous writers, cinematographers, and all the key people who worked for him on films. I believe the greatest of all ironies regarding The Academy Awards is the fact that Stanley Kubrick NEVER won an award for Best Director; whilst so many people who worked and acted in his films did win in their respective fields won Academy Awards. The only ""Oscar"" Kubrick ever won was for Best Visual Effects for ""2001"" (1968). However, he did win the highly coveted DGA Award (Director's Guild of America). He was not able to be present to receive the award, but sent a taped acceptance speech which was gracious and is also very ""Kubrickian"" (not an original term, but appropriate). I have seen it, but I forget where. I am sure it is on one of the Bluray copies of Kubrick's films. Another thing I like is delivered by Jack Nicholson, when asked about Kubrick. Nicholson replied (please excuse my paraphrasing) ""Everyone acknowledges he (Kubrick) is the man, and that is really an understatement"". It is chock full not only of scenes from all the films he made, but also includes scenes and information about films he didn't make. He always wanted to make a film about Napoleon. He had made extraordinary preparations for the film (for example, he had 10,000 uniforms made; half were made of paper for the troops very far away), but shelved it. The one film I truly wish he has made was to be called ""The Aryan Papers"" about a Jewish family hiding from the Nazis in WWII. As with Napoleon, he had gone to extreme lengths of preparation; however, once he heard Spielberg had begun shooting ""Schindler's List"", he shelved it as well. He knew both stories could not be told simultaneously. I even had a short-lived resentment against Spielberg. Take nothing away from ""Schindler"" and Spielberg, as it is a terrific film; probably the one he is most proud of. I truly believe Kubrick's film would have been better, but we will never know. Spielberg loved Kubrick and who knows (?), he may have had his own thoughts about this. I like what director and sometime actor Sydney Pollack mentions, the term ""perfectionist is used often about some directors; it usually means someone is a pain in the ass"". He does go on to say ""Stanley (Kubrick) is the only true 1000% perfectionist"". Whether you are a casual fan of Kubrick's films or an ultimate, almost obsessed fan (like me; I own all 13 feature length films he made, plus a couple of shorts), this is an absolute must see documentary. I will stop here, as I could go on indefinitely about my favorite director.",1480118400,2,3723,4.6941896024464835
