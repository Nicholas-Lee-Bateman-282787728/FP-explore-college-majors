8547952,5,B00A7OBLB6,"This is very informative and interesting; I grew up on the organ: playing, tuning, and repairing. I was still able to learn from this; it was fascinating to see what went into the planning and building of this very impressive instrument.",1456012800,,237,4.804878048780488

8547957,2,B00A7OBLB6,"There wasn't much information on the actual organ construction or its details, and the photography failed to provide a good perspective on the interior of the Disney Concert Hall. (I've toured the impressive facility, but only concert-goers were allowed inside.)  The recordings were OK, nothing noteworthy - especially when played on my TV. (Wouldn't play on my CD player/audio system.) Maybe I need to seriously look at one of those audio enhancers for my TV. On the other hand, the accompanying website had some excellent quality photos.",1418860800,2,540,5.206896551724138
