7950004,5,B00005QASZ,"I'm so glad to have this episode available on video!  It may be one of the best in the series.  Morrow does a splendid job of internalizing his pain, with his brother missing in action in the Pacific; and James Best, under whom I studied acting, performing convincingly as a soldier who tries to continually get out of combat and getting his redemption in the end.  The only disappointment was that the advertized format was color, but as in all ""Combat"" episodes, it's black and white.  This is a must for all fans of this series!  Also, the Okinawa campaign is after the seige in Europe is over, hence Morrow's brother and Morrow are on different time lines.",1147910400,,660,4.559322033898305
7950005,4,B00005QASZ,"Along with the two part classic, ""Hills Are For Heroes"", this
episode depicts a humanistic, sensitve side of Saunders which is rarely showcased on this series.  A cowardly, non-
confrontational soldier (James Best) is left to cover the back of Saunders during battle.  This occurs after Saunders receives news about a brother who's missing in action.
  A poignant, thought provoking episode which is easily one
of Combat's best.  And certainly one of Vic Morrow's best
performances.",1011571200,24,482,5.2894736842105265
7950006,5,B00005QASZ,"This is one of the best ""Saunders"" episodes from the 1960s WWII television series ""Combat!""  In this episode, Sergeant Saunders, while dealing with a malingerer, receives a personal letter with bad news.  One of the few episodes where fans learn something of Saunders' home life. Guest star James Best.",1009497600,14,302,5.142857142857143
