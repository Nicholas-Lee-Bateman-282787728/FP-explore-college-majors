8201051,3,B000QFAFPY,"As much as I love Junior Wells and Buddy Guy, this video left a lot to be desired.

The performances are very raw and loose with a lot of banter. Junior Wells keeps laughing throughout a couple of the songs. This shows their personality nicely, but some of the songs drag on and a lot of what is said is hard to understand because the recording is poor.

If you are a fan of their Hoodoo Man Blues album, as I am, you may be surprised that the restraint and efficiency displayed on that record are nowhere to be seen on this recording, which features a lot of over-the-top soloing that adds nothing, and extended jams that often seem to go nowhere.

The production value is very low. It looks and sounds like it was shot on VHS tape. With many older blues videos you have to just accept that the quality isn't going to be that good. However, by the 1980s when this was recorded, much greater quality was possible. Sadly, it wasn't achieved here.

This is especially problematic during quieter moments of some of the songs, which in my view would have been some of the best moments, but they were essentially inaudible.

Aside from all of those problems, this video does give us a glimpse into the live shows put on by Junior Wells and Buddy Guy and shows another side of their music that you don't see in their studio albums. This is much more of a hard-rocking blues than I had been expecting, and I got a lot of enjoyment out of seeing these legends perform. However, it ultimately didn't live up to my expectations (which were admittedly very high).",1378425600,2,1552,4.431578947368421

It's the only introductory and descriptive material available for the Amazon Prime version of this video, which comes without titles, credits, discussions (voiceover or other), lead-in, or anything else that might inform the viewer about this video. It is simply a 59 minute concert clip.

But what a clip. Junior Wells (harp) and Buddy Guy collaborated on the production of the blues classic Hoodoo Man Blues in 1965. This was Wells' debut album. Guy was the house guitarist for Chess Records. His recognition from people like Eric Clapton has resurrected his career at least once, maybe twice, and he is still belting it out these days at venues like Wolftrap. Wells went on to become one of the greats on the harp along with Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williamson.

The concert itself starts out a bit flat, even when Guy comes on. When Wells joins Guy, however, the two sparkle and sparks start to fly. Even those completely oblivious to the blues will know that they are witnessing two of the greats doing what they do best. I found the video to be a bit lackluster up to his point. The sound was at times muddy and the video transfer (in 4:3 mode) uninspiring.

If you are fan of Guy or Wells, or even if you just want to know why they are great, then this is well worth watching. It's especially worthwhile for people like me who have an interest in blues harp. If you like your video productions polished and complete, however, you are likely to find this one frustrating.",1337731200,,1519,4.66044776119403
8201053,3,B000QFAFPY,"THIS DVD IS A SAMPLING OF THE KIND OF BLUES CLUB WORK THAT MADE THESE GUYS LEGENDS.IT'S RAW NATURE IS CAUGHT HERE BUT WITH SOME DRAWBACKS.THE VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY ARE MARGINAL AT BEST.THE  SOUND SOMETIMES FADES IN AND OUT WHICH IS ANNOYING FOR ME.

ONLY FOR THE HARDCORE BLUES LOVERS",1189296000,5,573,4.509615384615385
8201054,5,B000QFAFPY,"This is the new offering from Blues Legends. Previously they have issued DVDs on Freddie King, Albert King and Memphis Slim with Sonny Boy Williamson. This concert is set at a place called Nightstage and they perform for 71 minutes. Footage of Buddy Guy as a younger player and concerts of Buddy with Junior Wells during their extended partnership are rather scarce. They have several snippets of material on other discs, the best being the now unavailable ""Muddy Waters at Montreux"" show. However, part of this show is on the Buddy Guy DVD with his Boxed Set released last year.

The concert here is a video transfer as you would expect and the sound is excellent. It begins with Buddy Guy coming on and offering only part of his recorded performance. We have seen some of this set previously on the Buddy Guy DVD from the Boxed Set. Buddy does a part of ""The Things I Used To Do"", ""Crazy About You"", ""Stormy Monday"" and playing like T-Bone Walker. This is the only big flaw in this presentation. The entire show should have been reproduced. Anyway, what we have is rare and good. Buddy plays in his usual style and with his thinline Guild guitar.

Buddy offers ""Look Over Yonder Wall"" a funky ""Crazy About You"" with him playing over the top of the guitar's neck and ""I Just Want To Make Love To You"" as a tribute to his mentor Muddy Waters. Junior is then introduced and comes out to play Little Walter's ""Everything's Gonna Be Alright"" and a tribute to Muddy Waters as well ending with ""Trouble No More"", great classic Chicago Blues.

When Junior joined Muddy Waters Band as a youngster he replaced Little Walter, what shoes to fill! Walter had recorded his masterpiece ""Juke"" and left the band. Junior offers us a version of ""Juke"" in this show. It, unfortunately, is a big disappointment. At this stage in their career, I feel, both Wells and Guy were well known and accepted. They were more intent on showmanship and not musicianship. However, the material on these people are so hard to get we have to give it 5 stars (like the Albert King program in this series-see my review)

The boys then go on to Sonny Boy Williamson's ""My Younger Days"" and the Chicago classic ""I Got My Mojo Working"" which are fine performances. Junior ends the set with a James Brown tribute. This is something he always did. When I saw him in Sydney in 1991 he opened with ""I Got You (I Feel Good) in a bright yellow suit looking and sounding and dancing like James Brown! Here Junior offers ""Super Bad"" and then right into ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"". A very sound ending to the show.

The bonus features are good, but the interview is hard to hear due to the background noise in the club. And it goes on for a long time! The bonus performances however are excellent and include ""Little By Little"" (not the Rolling Stones tune) from the main performance (see there are extra tracks we did not get!) and then from a place called ""The Channel"" in Boston we hear ""Better Than I Love Myself"" which, to me, is one of the best tracks on the whole DVD. Note: The DVD cover is wrong ""Little By Little"" is not at the Channel Club, it's at the original concert venue Nightstage.

OK this Blues Legends offering is great. We need as much material on these real innovators as we can possibly get. It would be so fantastic to see T-Bone Walker anywhere but he had a PBS concert with Shuggy Otis and his father in about 1975, Magic Sam at Ann Arbor, Albert King at the Fillmore, B.B. King at the Cafe Au Go Go, Little Walter, and so many more. I hope this series will continue! These people have also given us the excellent ""American Folk Blues Festivals"" series as well. Currently we are waiting eagerly for the Howlin' Wolf concert due to be released in October.",1189296000,7,3732,4.480882352941176
