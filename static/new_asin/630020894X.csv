7804972,5,630020894X,"The LION'S GATE 1990 VHS release of Raoul Walsh's PURSUED is a decent transfer of an unrestored (but OK) print, recorded in SP mode, with HiFi sound.

PURSUED is a rare film noir/western hybrid that has all the classic elements of both genres. The hero (played by Robert Mitchum) has a surly edge to him, but you'd be edgy too if all the grief that is heaped upon this fellow happened to you.

SYNOPSIS--
After his parents are violently murdered, young Jeb Rand is adopted by Ma Callum (Judith Anderson), who loves him dearly. Her tenderness isn't shared by Jeb's adopted brother Grant (Dean Jagger), whose rivalry with the adult Jeb (Robert Mitchum) leads to ever-increasing clashes. Jeb's affections for his ""sister"" Thorley (Teresa Wright) grow to something more significant (with Ma's blessings), which undoubtedly adds to Grant's irrational hatred.

On a coin flip, Jeb leaves his family behind, but problems are only beginning for him. He's relentlessly pursued and attacked by enemies of his father, who turn out to be Mrs. Callum's in-laws. And Grant wants to kill Jeb, too. Thorley and Jeb flee mounting dangers, and a climactic showdown soon follows.

Mitchum's ""break out"" movie very well may be THE STORY OF G.I. JOE. This gritty, realistic depiction of the 1943 Italian Campaign and the siege of Monte Cassino monastery also stars Burgess Meredith as bespectacled war correspondent Ernie Pyle.

A lot of good westerns were made in this time period ,but this is not one of them. Save your time and money on something else like ""Blood On The Moon"".",1201737600,,316,3.953125
