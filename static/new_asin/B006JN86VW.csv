4994786,4,B006JN86VW,Excellent written information about a subject alot of people knew of but did not relate to how large the problem was and how long it was in place is a standard practice.,1331856000,6,169,4.3125
4994787,5,B006JN86VW,"First I must say ""Every Human Being in America should see this"" No matter where you came from. If you are living in America you need to see this. Everyone has a right to know about this HIDDEN piece of American History. I intend to pass this DVD on to Everyone not just my Black American colleagues. The American Government has seen to it that certain pieces of vital American History be kept away from not just its own people but, the entire world. This Documentary based on the bestselling book by Douglas Blackmon is not too long, not too short and IT WILL NOT BORE YOU. I recommend this to all who want to know the whole truth.",1330992000,63,631,4.310924369747899
4994788,5,B006JN86VW,i  saw this  all the way through and it truly  will move you and makes you wonder and feel the pain and frustration and it feels not that long ago and  you see how  things  are still tied to it. id say this  video needs to be seen all and discussed because it is a  subject that has never been dealt with properly and it is a painful chapter. very much a  reality felt til this day and beyond.,1330041600,15,393,3.8734177215189876
4994789,5,B006JN86VW,"The material in this documentary is painful and rare. The Black American experience you now understand today will forever be altered by the insights of this film, because this is a history who's scope has been widely omitted.

August Wilson's ""Joe Turner's Come and Gone"" and Earnest Gains' ""Of Love and Dust"" make some allusions to this injustice, but never have I seen its breadth and magnitude so poignantly illustrated as in this well produced documentary.",1329523200,45,460,5.052631578947368

4994791,5,B006JN86VW,"Thank you sooo much for this enlighting film.  I watched it last ninght on PSB and was amazed by the things I learned.  It filled in the void I kept running into while I have been trying to research my family tree.  It explains how people just fell off the face of the earth.  They disappeared, some forever, for no reason.  This should show that so much of our history is distorted and needs to be rewritten to be all inclusive.  Not slanted.  Thank you PBS and keep educating our people, all people.",1329177600,140,501,4.32258064516129
4994792,5,B006JN86VW,"I watched this movie on last night on PBS. It opened my eyes to things I knew nothing about! As a child of the 50's I heard on and off about things that happened during this time in American history. As I watched this movie it brought tears to my eyes to see how one human being could treat another human being and not think nothing of it.

My grandparents were sharecroppers in the south and had to sneak their 5 daughters to the North one by one as young teenage girls because 2 of their sons were lynched at a young age.

I never knew that it was against the law to leave your farm as a sharecropper you would be hunted down, brought back or killed.

I thank God that my grandfather and grandmother did not have their lives taken away from them because they both made it to the North, but their lives where never the same.

This is apart of history that everyone one in this nation should know about.",1329177600,328,903,4.172413793103448
4994793,5,B006JN86VW,"I had the pleasure of seeing a screening of this in Washington DC. This is a powerful and moving film from the Pulitzer winning book. Beautifully shot and edited, it uses fascinating interview footage of descendants and historians, and riveting historical reenactments. It received a two minute standing ovation at Sundance. This is a film you will want to share and watch often.",1328486400,125,379,5.031746031746032

4994795,5,B006JN86VW,"Absolutely excellent!! This tells the post-reconstruction experience of slaves in a stunningly vivid way, with many personal accounts. It made me understand so much better the current distrust of the judicial system in light of the way it was used to re-enslave so many, in such despicable conditions. I originally saw the show on PBS, and ordered it so I could show it to friends; they were as stunned as I was, and I ended up buying a few more copies so they could have their own to share with their families. It does have some pretty graphic material, so it's probably not appropriate for younger viewers -- definitely not kids, middle schoolers might be OK, depending on their level of maturity. But I wish it's something all high schoolers would see as part of their history classes; it's not something most people are familiar with, and that's a shame.",1507075200,,858,4.726666666666667

4994800,5,B006JN86VW,I can not really say I love it. It's a horrifying documentary. I had no idea that this continued long after slavery ended. In some ways maybe I should not be surprised. 1945 Roosevelt still had not signed off on an antilynching bill. Very revealing but very painful,1487980800,,265,4.541666666666667

4994823,5,B006JN86VW,"Gut-wrenching to watch, mainly because it rang so true. I can only hope that my relatives from Georgia before and after the War between the States were among the people who never owned or dealt with slaves, any of the indentured servants or the renting out of African-American prisoners.  I'm pretty sure that the Veals in my direct line were not involved, but even having said that, my genealogy research has found dozens of African-Americans in U.S. Census records who bear my surname.  In Alabama, this year (2015), I intentionally visited a black woman in Alabama with whom I share the exact same surname, Veal.  We talked for about 2 hours or more on her front porch.  She told me that she'd never met a white person with the surname Veal.  I told her that likewise I'd never met an African-American with the surname Veal, though I did know that there were probably hundreds in census records in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and probably many other states.  While trying to find this woman (who was about my age) I went to several homes in that area of Alabama, where I'd learned that other black Veal families had lived at one time or another.  I found no other Veals in that area, but everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and as helpful as they could.  In most cases, they invited me in there homes and we talked for an hour or more.",1450396800,,1359,4.586776859504132

4994825,3,B006JN86VW,"I learned some specific historal information I was not aware of prior to seeing this. So this film did its job well in that aspect. I am only concerned that his film could be misledaing to the uninformed. I overstand this film is pertaining to the slavery system transforming to a penal slavery system in the south. But I got a bias, misleading feeling with the real subliminal message of this film. In a sneaky way, it seems to try to make it look like only Whites in the south were evil toward African people. When the informed know this is far from the truth. The south was just maybe more blunt and open with their evil than the north. While the north threw rocks and hid hands. I am fully aware this could all just be my perception and nothing more. But I just wanted to share that. Overall this was a decent doc and I am glad someone shined more light on this part of American history.",1446163200,,891,4.27810650887574

4994828,5,B006JN86VW,"I highly recommend this to other teachers and professor and students that can handle the truth! And we thought American Slavery was bad. This is the way the government kept slaves after Emancipation through the prison slave system. If you tried to escape you got shot with no repercussion because you were just an escaped prisoner. These Black men were traded out to other prisons to work in coal mines worse than any white coal miners. They were imprisoned for standing outside called ""vagrancy laws"" and put to work in labor camps called prisons. Many were just dumped into the river if they died or did not comply. I liked the commentary by the historians both Black and white that added insights into the stories and pictures and video. One lady had thought that her wealthy great-grandfather(?) was a ""self-made man"" she found out where his wealth came from and was visibly shaken by it. It finally talked about how the wealth from this legal slave industry poured in and that was my main interest, see how whites created capital for generations to come  without paying the Black man or his family anything. These types of prisons were not really shut down until the 1960's. Now there is still an overabundance of Black men in the Prison Industrial Complex not different than what they had back then. More humanitarian groups are out protesting the unequal distribution of the law against men of color for similar offenses as white men. The prisons are privatized and are paid based upon the volume of prisoners in the prison. It is a cycle with the same type of prisoner - Black males.",1444780800,2,1591,4.723021582733813

4994830,5,B006JN86VW,"Troubling on a biblical scale. I thought I knew the post reconstruction Jim crow era... turns out I didn't.  No documentary will take the place of serious research, but this is the best jumping off point I can imagine.  If you went to pique someone's interest and snatch them out of the doldrums of apathy but can't convince them to read a book... show them this film if it doesn't make them sit up and take notice... nothing will.
I cried.  Both for the pain of the victims the inhumanity of their oppressors AND the folly of my ignorance.",1444435200,,540,4.434343434343434

I am perturbed when primarily Caucasian Americans (some don't share this perspective but many do) want African-Americans to ""shut-up"" at how they were treated during and after slavery but the Jews can just keep on talking and making movies about the horrors of the holocaust.  I think that the holocaust should not have ever occurred.  Slavery continued for over 400 years and again, the badges of slavery are still deeply rooted and intricately woven into the fabric of North America (United States) and abroad.",1379635200,3,674,5.222222222222222
4994874,5,B006JN86VW,"I am purchasing this dvd purely due to its content and by the other reviews. I have in my Dvd collection already at least 3-4 based on the Indiginous American Red Indian and how they as were other Indiginious peoples such as the Aboriginal in Australia. The Indiginous New Zealanders, The South African so on and so on have been treated with complete disrespect by White man. That is British and European white people who for some reason truly believe simply they are superior to anyone with darker skin. This belief i find to be astounding as it is ridiculous. The Indiginous peoples of the planet truly cared for the Earth, the fauna the animals etc etc. There was no greed in their societies and as with the Red Indian the Indiginous were wise and treat their elders with the respect they deserve. This often times does not happen with white man and their offspring. The word CARE is not in their vocabulary, care for others, care for our planet and the envirenment. What the English did to the black Aricans by kidnapping peoples and turning them into slaves with no conscience makes this DVD one that all Nations peoples should watch. Here in Australia i have a great amount of respect for many Indiginous peoples i know well and even though i am from European descent i feel i understand and comprehend the wrongs done to Indiginous peoples. Their land was stolen and taken without any thought or compunction. The arrogance of some whites is incomprehensible to me. Any activists such Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr/ even Robert Kennedy. John Lennon who wrote the most imoportant composition of music of all time was IMAGINE, the Indiginous were nullified. White humans require i believe now need to take a good look at themselves and the society we have built but htis will never happen. I am praying that the US and Allies do not intervene in Syria where the Drews, Muslims and Catholics have lived quietly and peacefully together for hundreds of years. I am concerned that certain nations require their soldiers to be at war constantly. They kill their youth in their prime. i would say ""please do not start WW3"". The Middle East is in crisis amd we need to allow them to sort out their politics without our intervention. Slavery was and is Iniquitous/evil. Nelson Mandella is a great man, like Gandhi he managed to capture respect by being who he is and he is a better man than billions of White men. His passing will be a watershed moment. We all need to respect all races/religions and customs and as is according to the US ""Every man is born equal"".LOL, I am looking forward to watching this most educational dvd which is the hard truth and no amount of propaganda can change that.

This book is highly informative and should be vigorously sought from Amazon.com, and read by all people who sincerely believe in Social Justice and Equality for all people.  It also painfully reveals truths hidden from many persons concerning their misleading super-moral ancestry.  Such an example is expressed in ""Slavery By Another Name"" by a beautiful woman of European descent. Her story of enlightenment brought tears to my eyes.

4994894,5,B006JN86VW,"When people say that slavery happened a long time ago, they don't know their history. And I didn't know mine very well until watching this documentary based on a Pulitzer prize winning book. It shows how the South kept slavery alive through the use of Peonage, working to pay off impossible debts (many of which were fabricated), and through the use of the criminal justice system for crimes that were also commonly fabricated (remember the ""chain gangs"" where you didn't see a single white face among them). These groups of ""convicts"" and ""debtors"" were rented out by the state to corporations who abused them to the point of death, in some cases, and reaped enormous profits as a result. One of the most interesting facets of this films was the revelation that our nations economy, and especially the South's booming economy, depended on keeping this tradition alive. Two presidents who discovered the continued use of slavery and wanted to correct it, stopped short when they realized how wide-spread it was, and what that would mean for the nation's economy and their own political survival. This film will shock you at times, but every American with a conscience should watch it. Counter to what your high school history teachers told you, slavery did not end with the civil war. Buy it, watch it, and then pass it on to everyone you know. It's a great film, and very well directed and produced.",1361664000,2,1400,4.813278008298755

4994896,5,B006JN86VW,"I watched ""Slavery by Another Name"" yesterday and have not been able to think about much since.  I am a white grandmother who grew up and lives in Alabama and I wonder HOW it is that NO ONE has ever brought up this topic before.  I knew about the Scottsboro ""boys"" and other isolated happenings, but never knew the widespread evil that was going on during that time. I just cannot fathome how anyone would ever think that the supression of fellow human beings would ever be acceptable in the eyes of God or man. Just WHAT were they thinking - can people really be THAT greedy?

I have, from time to time, heard different persons say, ""They (meaning blacks) need to just cut it with the attitude.  The war between the state was 150 years ago.  Get over it.""  Now I know that the real truth is that it hasn't been so very long ago at all - it was still happening when I was a child!!! And I never, never knew.  It makes me wonder if something else is happening now!

My father was a share cropper's son who was only allowed to go to the third grade - he was made to leave school to work the farm.  So, even though they were white, they also suffered similar injustices.

4994900,5,B006JN86VW,"Slavery by another name was an excellent book and DVD. I believe this DVD deserved the highest rating because of the extensive research that it took to uncover to the world what most African-Americans already knew that African-American Slavery did not end with the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation or the 13th, 14th, or 15th Amendment. What the DVD revealed was that the proclamation and laws only removed the federal support from American Slavery, and it showed how the federal government did very little to enforce the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments for African-Americans. As the government showed little interest in enforcing those laws, the states, municipalities, and corporations used those gaps by the federal government to continue slavery by other names such as: 1) sharecropping, 2) tenant farming, and 3) peonage. Although sounding different from slavery, they were just as exploitive, brutal, and dehumanizing. Ultimately, it showed how powerful americans continued the brutal system of dehumanizing slavery after federal laws forbade it.

4994914,5,B006JN86VW,"It may sound inconceivable but, crime has not always had a ""black face.""  A century and a half ago, people (blacks, also) were pretty much judged by their actions. Following the end of slavery, it began to be very profitable, for certain segments of the white community, for blacks to be painted with very broad, very criminal strokes. This profit-thing began with the state run chain-gang system, where states would hire out blacks to industries and large land owners to pave roads or pick crops.
  Now, crime having a black face works to fill prison beds (prisons for profits ""clean-up"" under these circumstances. Slap a felony charge on these former inmates and America winds up with a huge group of men unable to work (be compensated fairly for their labor) and unable to vote, borrow money for college, or any kind of training. To not turn out as a ""predator"" or a ""hunter or gatherer"" takes extreme discipline or family support.
  Again, this is a must read for those suspect that the image projected of the black male is not quite true.

Farmers and businessmen needed to find replacements for the labor force once their slaves had been freed depriving Southern slaveholders of $2 billion in human property and ensuring the permanent freedom of more than 4 million in bondage. Convict leasing began in 1865 and ended in the last state, Alabama, in 1928. It was a system in which armies of free men, most were guilty of no crimes and entitled by law to freedom, were compelled to labor without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were forced to do the bidding of white masters through the regular application of extraordinary physical coercion. The sole aim of convict leasing was financial profit to the lessees who exploited the labor of the prisoners to the fullest, and to the government which sold the convicts to the lessees.
