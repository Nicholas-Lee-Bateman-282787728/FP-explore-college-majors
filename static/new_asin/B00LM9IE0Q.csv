It's strange that I am a fan of Niblock's music, when I truly do not like listening to loud music either in concert or in a home environment.

His concerts are ""loud"" because of the music's reliance on ""overtones"" which appear as the volume is cranked.

So why do I like the long minimal droney sounds played at either low or medium volume levels? Beats me.",1476489600,,526,4.458333333333333
