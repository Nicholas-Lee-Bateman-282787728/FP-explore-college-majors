It isn't a film-noir, more of a Drama or Thriller.

The Killer That Stalked New York (1950) plays off as some turgid 1950's health department warning to the citizens of America that smallpox is on the loose.  It starts off with a rough-voiced narrator giving us the goods on some dame who smuggled in diamonds from Cuba.  Well, it seems she picked up something else, the smallpox.  She visits many places and then starts an epidemic in Manhattan.  The health department, staffed by idiots it seems and cantankerous old men who complain constantly, are trying to send flatfoot health department investigators to find out where it started from, I don't know why.  Plus they want to inoculate each and every person in the five boroughs.  These folks were geniuses.

One interesting thing is for architecture buffs to look out for the ambiance, it was filmed both in New York City and Los Angeles, California.  She arrives to the Pennsylvania Station (191063) in Manhattan, but the interiors don't look anything like it.  it was probably a station in Los Angeles.

Put in a pestiferous T-man (treasury agent) looking for the dame and a few stupid comments from gawkers and this makes for an even worse picture.

They add some crime element to the film, with the dame who smuggled in diamonds from Cuba and her husband who double-crossed her.  There's plenty of sanctimonious narration from the rough-voiced narrator and those 1950's ""thank you"" to all the departments involved ending credits.

In all, it's really not that good, Panic in the Streets (1950) directed by Elia Kazan with Richard Widmark and Jack Palance, which had a similar story, did it much better.

You'll recognize plenty of faces from TV and film.",1461369600,,1755,4.878378378378378

This crime story is set in New York city. You may recognize some buildings, others are gone (like that elevated train). Those familiar with this location will note the changes since 1951. Diamond merchants are clustered in mid-town. Note the few automobiles on the street, the clothing (men were hats), and other things from that era. The crime here is dealing in smuggled diamonds brought into this country from Cuba. [Another contraband item was drugs, unmentionable under the Hollywood Production Code of 1935.]

The complication is the smuggler also has a case of smallpox, a deadly disease that has disappeared after widespread vaccination. The police and health authorities can trace this woman by the new outbreaks of smallpox. Some die even after hospitalization and treatment. Will the smuggler be caught before she spreads the disease? One young boy catches the disease after using a public water fountain! The smuggler learns that $50,000 in smuggled diamonds is only worth $40,000 to a dealer, if he wanted to buy these goods.

This movie is slow-paced, more education than an action entertainment. It shows the culture and attitudes of that era. It is worth watching. But wasn't vaccination required before 1950? It would be scarier if it was a new disease that could affect many, many people.",1461196800,,1351,5.076576576576577
