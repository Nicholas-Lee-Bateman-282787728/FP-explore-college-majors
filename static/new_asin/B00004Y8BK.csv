As the century is about to turn, a group of young people are attending a New Year's Eve future-themed costume party in an apartment in Paris. One of the young men, played by Romain Duris, escapes from the revelry through a crack in the ceiling and in climbing upwards he finds himself in a strange Paris of the future, when drifting sand has buried the bases of the buildings and people travel in vehicles made from the dbris of past technologies but drawn by animals. He is welcomed by an odd assortment of people living together as a family who hail him as their grandfather, but only if he conceives the elderly man played by Jean-Paul Belmondo that night back in 1999 Paris. The soundtrack and the shifting avenues of sand and the odd conveyances are somehow mesmerizing - a simple retelling of the plot doesn't convey the fascination of this film. In French with English subtitles.",1447027200,,964,4.710059171597633
