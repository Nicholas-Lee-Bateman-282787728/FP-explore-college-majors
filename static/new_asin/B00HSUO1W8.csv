8635600,1,B00HSUO1W8,"Wow, I really don't know where to begin. The moves and video  are so outdated. I was not at all impressed by the instructors physique. The moves would have been decent if she had some curves. I would highly recommend glute training and overall weight training to firm her body in addition to what she is doing here. I couldn't focus on the moves because her body was blah. It is like an overweight trainer training an advanced athlete. No she isn't overweight she is beautiful she just has to firm up. I am not perfect and not trying to be mean at all and I would say this as a friend. The video is art but I find it hard to believe this is Jo's best effort. To me and this is just my opinion  It felt like a sleezy 90's non ethnic type strip club dance... as best I can describe. The music just wasn't sexy at all. I'm going to give this one a thumbs down. But oh my wow Exotic Dance Private Dancer by Lady Morrighan OMG is worth every dollar .  That is totally up to date she has a very nice body, great booty, and her moves are so sexy. That is what I was looking for more of a sexy, chair dance that firms you up as well.",1476057600,,1125,3.991111111111111

8635602,5,B00HSUO1W8,"Gotta love Jo! She is cute, spunky and so very informative. I watched her DVDs, I have 4 of them and was very pleased with every single one. She has a handbook to burlesque. It was wonderful!! Rich in history, experience and advice. She is honest and is not shy to explain the best moves for your shape. If your larger, smaller, large breast or not. These DVDs will help you feel comfortable in your own skin. With confidence, we all can accomplish our goals with class and grace. If you are a house wife aspiring stripper, if only in the bedroom or a dancer wanting to explore other genres of dance. These are the best out there.

I started reading the handbook  2 week into my 10 week burlesque class I took on the west coast. Once I read it, I felt so much more comfortable and informed with what the instructors were teaching and now when I watch others perform. I have never met Jo or been on the east coast but if I ever visit, I know where I am heading!",1427500800,2,960,4.211956521739131
