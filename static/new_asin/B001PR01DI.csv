8334369,1,B001PR01DI,"You better off search youtube for training video than buying this one.  Project is done very amateurishly,  paces, footage's, speaker are not very interesting.  You would get better production value from a 12 year kid on youtube. The DVD does not cover more detail materials like advance dvd menu layouts.

Save your money, buy a book or watch online free tutorials instead.  I regret buying this product.",1284076800,,405,4.985074626865671
