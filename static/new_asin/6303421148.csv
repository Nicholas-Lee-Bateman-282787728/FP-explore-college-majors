Iloved it and think that it should be played on television at prime time .to show young women to have courage in the face of lifes pitfalls.that material things aren't all there is to life.cissy and the rest of the cast are truly actors. And i felt like I was really involved with the movie and didn't want it to end.",1014768000,13,585,4.425925925925926
640009,5,6303421148,"A terrific adaptation of Catherine Cookson's novel - superb acting, engrossing plotline and endearing characters. This is the story of orphaned Cissie Brodie who does everything she can to care for her younger siblings.  They are forced to live in cave on the fells and live in depressed  circumstances. Matthew Turnbull is a poor, handsome carpenter who falls in  love with Cissie and helps her - but Matthew must choose between his love  for her and the need to support his elderly parents (in short, marry for  love or marry for money).
Cissie is raped by a drunken, young aristocrat  (Clive Fischel) and soon finds herself in a custody battle with Lord  Fischel - the grandfather of her child. Clive returns from banishment at  sea a changed man and vows to ""set things right"" with Cissie.
You'll have to find out for yourself how this all ends...but rest  assured you will be on the edge of your seat and engrossed from beginning  to end!  A truly satisfying love story and a wonderful tale of courage,  perseverance and inner strength.",952560000,50,1041,4.754189944134078

7845917,4,6303421148,"I read this book as a young adult and am just a little disappointed in the changes that this adaptation made to the story.  Spoiler alert:  yes, Cissies falls in love and lives ""happily ever after"" with her rapist but this version doesn't go into the detail required to understand why and how.  For those who gave the mini-series 1-2 stars and couldn't believe she would ever forgive her attacker, I would recommend reading the book.  In it, she and Clive are much older when they come together (Richard, their son, is a grown man and was under the impression that his mother had died in childbirth).  Anyway, the mini-series was visually stunning and diverting, giving a glimpse of the hardships of the times and the heroic struggle with which Cissie is faced to keep her family together.  I do like the way it shows that, for all his declarations of love, Matthew was not capable of overcoming his fears and marry Cissie when he could have.  Bottom line, he was a good man but cowardly and suffered in a loveless (and probably sexless) marriage as a result.",1339977600,,1059,4.601063829787234
7845918,2,6303421148,"Catherine Cookson's The Dwelling Place left a bland taste in my mouth.  The story of hardship for a young girl and her siblings after the death of her parents is moving enough.  The man who supposedly loves and cares for her marries another woman for her father's money as a miller.  Not exactly riches.  He confesses his undying love and is frankly a jerk.  Cissy, who has a baby out of wedlock, after the landowner's son rapes her, eventually gives up the child to the family.  I thought that a bit unlikely that a rich landlord would want a bastard son to raise, but the story played upon his disgust over his son's actions.  To top if off, the son is responsible for the accidental death of his sister, which is subsequently hidden rather than confessing what actually happened.  She eventually rewards her raper by falling in love with him, another jerk in my opinion, in the end.  Even her own son doesn't love her.  The only redeeming quality in the story was her determination to take care of the family after the death of their parents rather than have them all shipped off to the poor house.  Frankly, the plot didn't sit well with me, and the ending left me cold.",1333065600,2,1174,4.490566037735849
7845919,1,6303421148,"Perhaps it is unfair of me, and I am sorry, but for me, one scene and all it represents can ruin an entire movie.  SPOILER ALERT!  Telling your rapist not to feel badly or blame himself about raping you?  Okay.... And that, if only your brother hadn't set a rabbit trap, or if folks weren't so hungry, well, there is no way a spoiled, incestuous nitwit would have raped (at the goading of his equally repulsive sister) an innocent girl  who was just minding her business carrying her milk home WITH her little brother at her side!  Um, wait, what?  Worst line ever from Cissie to rapist, ""If people had enough to eat and keep warm, I don't think things would happen, do you?"" No girl, just no...Nope, sorry this is not the movie for me (but I understand and respect that others love the movie).  Maybe if in this scene you could tell that she was only saying this so that she could provide a better life for her family (but inwardly she was disgusted by the words coming out of her mouth)...or something...but no, she is genuine in her ""love"" for this raping buffoon.  And why do they love each other?  What scenes did I miss between the rape and this one that would make this change believable?  I am sorry, I just cant...",1325635200,6,1223,4.371681415929204
7845920,3,6303421148,"I just watched this film and the ending was not to my liking. After all the rich people had done to Cissie and she is in love with the man who raped her! I know it was the evil sister who mostly caused all the grief.. And it leaves it hanging with never knowing whether the rich guy returns or not..The other man who claimed to love her..well he loved money more, when he could have married her...yet he chose The Mill and the woman who went with it. The story was good, but mixed up to me and cause of the ending..I will not watch it again.",1318204800,4,541,4.018518518518518
7845921,1,6303421148,"The photography was lovely in the movie - but I was horrified at the ending.  A women is raped, has a child from this crime and in the end falls for her rapist.

This is a disgusting depiction of women.",1286236800,2,202,4.025
7845922,5,6303421148,"Cissie Brodie is an orphaned girl whose parents die of Cholera. Refusing to allow her siblings to go to the workhouse she instead takes them to live in a cave on the Northumbrian moor. Helped by the man who loves her, Cissie's brave struggle to make a home for herself and for her siblings is the essence of what the dwelling place is all about.

I found this romance very intriguing. Cissie has two suitors, and many adventures and tragedies which threaten to shatter her happiness. The scenery is beautiful and the story is wild and unpredictable.

I recommend this for fans of historical drama. 5 abundant stars.",1217462400,2,615,4.685185185185185
