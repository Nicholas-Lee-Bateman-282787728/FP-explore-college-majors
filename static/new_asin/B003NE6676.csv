8400874,5,B003NE6676,"Very fascinating program about the history of the nuclear bomb, and fantastic film footage of nuclear bomb tests! This program explores what countries like the U.S. and Russia plan to do to dismantle their nuclear bomb programs since the 'Cold War'.

The nuclear 'Genie': The Douglas AIR-2 Genie (previous designation MB-1) was an unguided air-to-air rocket with a 1.5 kt W25 nuclear warhead. It was deployed by the United States Air Force (USAF 1957-1985) and Canada (Royal Canadian Air Force 1965-68, Air Command 1968-84) during the Cold War. Production ended in 1962 after over 3000 were produced, with some related training and test derivatives occurring later. The popular name was Genie, but it was often nicknamed ""Ding-Dong"". About 3,150 rounds were produced before production ended in 1963. In 1962 the weapon was re-designated AIR-2A Genie. Many rounds were upgraded with improved, longer-duration rocket motors, the upgraded weapons sometimes known as AIR-2B. An inert training round, originally MB-1-T and later ATR-2A, was also produced in small numbers. This nuclear 'Genie' could kill 17 times over.

In 1991, Russia and America agreed to reduce their nuclear stockpiles by 90% by the year 2003. Sixty thousand nuclear warheads had to be scrapped. The Pantex plant is America's only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility, and is charged with maintaining the safety, security and reliability of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. The facility is located on a 16,000 acre site 17 miles northeast of Amarillo, Texas in the Panhandle of Texas. To-date, the plant has only managed to complete 63% of nuclear bomb disarmament. It is estimated that it will cost in excess of $300 billion dollars to disarm all the nuclear bombs in our arsenal.

And this all began with one man: Albert Einstein. In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included emigre physicist Le Szilrd attempted to alert Washington of ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilrd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, ""regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."" In the summer of 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Einstein was persuaded to lend his prestige by writing a letter with Szilrd to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to alert him of the possibility. The letter also recommended that the U.S. government pay attention to and become directly involved in uranium research and associated chain reaction research.

The letter is believed to be ""arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II"". President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the ""race"" to develop the bomb, drawing on its ""immense material, financial, and scientific resources"" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II.

For Einstein, ""war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war."" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, ""I made one great mistake in my life -- when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification -- the danger that the Germans would make them ..."".

Nuclear armed bomber planes, named 'Little Boy' and 'Fat Man' dropped the first nuclear hydrogen bombs during World War II on a specific nation: Japan, and the cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima; killing 70,000-100,000 people. The colorized archival film footage contained in this program of the horrendous aftermath of those bombings is horrific, to say the least. A real eye-opener as to the destruction of modern weapons and their awesome destructive power.

Russia and the Eastern Bloc nations are in a 'nuclear limbo'. Plutonium goes missing and fissile material can be bought on the 'black market'. In nuclear engineering, fissile material is one that is capable of sustaining a chain reaction of nuclear fission. By definition, fissile materials can sustain a chain reaction with neutrons of any energy. The predominant neutron energy may be typified by either slow neutrons (i.e., a thermal system) or fast neutrons. Fissile materials can be used to fuel thermal-neutron reactors, with a neutron moderator; fast-neutron reactors, with no moderators; and nuclear explosives. So, how safe are any of us with this kind of material floating around and easily accessible?

This is an extremely interesting program, well done and very thought provoking. I recommend it highly for those of us who worry about the future of mankind, and what on earth are we going to do to rid ourselves of all of these nuclear warheads and nuclear material? The scary part is: No one really knows......",1378684800,,5215,5.127058823529412
