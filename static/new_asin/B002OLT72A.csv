8376098,3,B002OLT72A,"This starts out with an examination of if the Tower of Babel could have been a then modern miracle build into the heavens, then examines the possibilities of if David could have taken out Goliath with a sling. From there it goes into some surreal directions that can be viewed and pondered.",1518393600,,290,4.596153846153846

8376101,5,B002OLT72A,"This 47-minute History Channel documentary starts strong, loses focus a bit toward the middle, and then ends well enough. The ""Mythbusters"" take on exploring the scientific plausibility of miraculous events in the Old Testament is highly entertaining. It's an ""infotainment"" approach to science, looking at several ancient stories (tower of Babel, David and Goliath, the unconsumed burning altar of Elijah, Roman soldiers under Pompey ambushed by deadly bees in 67 BC, and the levitating ark of the covenant) through modern technological recreations. The first two segments, looking at the potential height of the baked-brick Ziggurats of ancient Mesopotamia and the killing impact of small slingshots) are really entertaining and fast-moving. Unfortunately, the film slows down and goes off-topic when it shifts to the bee segment examining the Roman soldiers attacked under Pompey, which isn't even part of the Bible and is therefore surprising to find included in a video titled ""Lost Science of the Bible."" After several minutes of relatively uninteresting beekeeper stuff, we get to the altar of Elijah, which is less interesting (why not do the burning bush?) since it's a more obscure passage of the Torah. The flying ark is likewise less interesting than it sounds, relating more speculation about the possibilities of levitation than actual science, although the featured scientists who specialize in experimental physics are somewhat interesting. Nevertheless, this is a strong feature overall, and it doesn't contradict the settled beliefs of Jews and Christians, In fact, several of the interviewees are Jewish rabbis and professors based in the Holy Land who assert the historicity of the tales in question, which is a refreshing perspective given the crude anti-religiosity (i.e. religion=superstition) that one frequently finds in History Channel documentaries. Despite the several minutes where it drags on the off-topic bee attack, it makes a good companion video for any sort of Bible study or scripture class either in the Jewish or Christian tradition. I enjoyed it and recommend it.",1392163200,,2103,5.493827160493828
8376102,4,B002OLT72A,"You could take this two ways:
1) it shows how amazing happenings in the Bible are possible thru known science
2) it eliminates the miraculous hand of God
This DVD is done respectfully from a scientific standpoint (by Jewish scholars for the most part), but it strongly alluded to the idea that man (science) knows how humans could've done it...you have to draw from that your own inferences.
I thought it was interesting because I search for the truth in all things and my faith is not diminished when I learn that Elijah may have used information either available at that time from magicians of the day, or from God, to influence the spiritual direction chosen by those who would be lost otherwise...the question is: where did Eliljah get the information? ....you have to choose...",1365724800,,782,4.8
