8763632,5,B01GVX5QQM,"I love to do Ashtanga yoga. Although my background is in ballet and Pilates, im still in the Ashtanga primary series still dealing with old ballet wounds from the past.  I was looking for a hip opening dvd to help me with the sitting sequence in the primary series. This dvd is 2.5 hours long (something I shouldve known before purchasing it). If I knew this prior to ordering it, I probably wouldnt have ordered it but glad I did! The dvd is a yoga workshop (something Ive never experienced or have allowed myself the time for yoga). The longest class Ive participated was 1.5 like Bikram yoga or Ashtanga primary series.

Once I accepted this class was going to be 2.5 hours, I dove into it. I literally felt my hip tension dissolve and melt away. The class really flew by!

As for the body mind connection, the hips hold a lot of stress and old wounds- memories from the past reappeared through some of the poses and made peace with them.

This dvd is extremely affective and therapeutic.",1535500800,,991,4.488888888888889

My hips feel great and way more details about what I should be doing, feeling and experiencing in each pose than most classes. Can't wait to take her online Core Functional Fitness Course.",1490486400,,272,4.352941176470588
