It was quirky and fun and thoroughly entertaining with a crazy magical creature. a physicist and a 14 year old boy Josh Kirby out to save the world. Great, clean fun. Highly recommend.",1523232000,,324,4.327868852459017

8060551,5,B0009GX27I,"I bought this movie for my neice thinking it looked interesting, although I had never heard of it anywhere. When we watched it I was amazed at how well the story was done, with beautiful special effects, and the whole story of the Nullifier and everything was just great science fiction. The story is also full of cute characters and great kid songs that are catchy and not annoying at all. Since buying it for her, the movie has been one of the most requested watches of my neice and her mom told me last week how she knows all the songs and the names of the people in the story, and that it has become one of her favorites. So today I found two more of the movies in the series and ordered them for her. The stories are just good clean family entertainment and if it brings about a young interest in science fiction and thinking beyond what is accepted to be true in science, then I'm more than proud to give them as gifts. They really are a great set of movies for kids.",1181952000,2,973,4.208556149732621
