8193033,4,B000PS93VO,"The film tells the story of Jeanette Bauch, a young, unmarried mother and her son, Louis. Jeanette loves her son, but if often blind to his needs. She has a crush on her next door neighbor (why, I don't know), while her son seems to have only one friend: Harry, the coach of the local amateur soccer team. The title comes from a part of Jena that was once outside the gates and outside the law.

The story is languid and relatively uneventful. If you like action movies, then this is probably not a good choice. Stefanie Stappenbeck, who plays Jeanette, turns in a top-notch performance, making Jeanette a likable character in spite of her flaws. Marco Mittelstaedt does a good job of directing, allowing the story to take its own sweet time to unfold. Kudos also to Judith Kaufmann, one of the most underappreciated cinematographers around, who gives this film a solidly real, and yet dreamy appearance.

The English translation is reasonably good, but note that the special features are without subtitles. This is a region 2 and PAL disk, so you need a multi-region player that can handle PAL to watch it.",1206403200,,1107,4.701030927835052
