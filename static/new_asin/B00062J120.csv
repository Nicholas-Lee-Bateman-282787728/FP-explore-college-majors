2163004,5,B00062J120,"So what if Clark is still in high school. The actors and their performances in this show makes this the best Superman show ever. My favorite character is Lex Luthor. For every good there is evil... Clark brings hope, but Lex's journey to the dark side makes this show superb. Tom did a good job but Rosenbaum did a great job.",1104969600,4,325,4.344262295081967
2163005,5,B00062J120,"When 'Smallville' first aired, I had no interest in watching it.  Then my roomate, who is a Superman fan from beginning to end, got me into it by making me watch it one night, and I have been addicted to it since.  I have all three seasons on DVD proudly displayed by my TV system.  It was really painful when I moved to England before the second season aired in Canada, but fortunatly my mom mailed me the seasons as they became available.  All I can say is it's my second favorite TV show ever behind M*A*S*H.  I can't wait for the fourth season.",1103500800,,548,4.230769230769231
2163006,5,B00062J120,"This is how a Superman series should be! I must admit that in the beginning,I was a little bit skeptical. I could not help but wonder if a series about Superman in training would be interesting. I'm here to tell you this is the greatest Superman T.V. show of all time. The casting of this series is excellent(unlike Lois and Clark,where you had the worst Superman and the best Lois Lane).Every actor in this show is terrific. Tom Welling brings such authenticity and humanity to this character. Even though Brandon Routh has been cast as the man of steel in the new Superman movie,I would have been completely satisfied with Welling in the role(but I'm sure Brandon Routh will do just fine).What impresses me the most about Smallville is that the series gets better the longer it runs. Usually the longer a show runs,the more it slides. Great cast, great soundtrack, great stories. It doesn't get any better than this!",1102118400,3,918,4.74375
2163007,5,B00062J120,"The popular TV series on the WB channel follows the life of young Clark Kent (Played by Tom Welling) as a teenager.

The Kryptonite that falls in Smallville with Clark causes some crazy things to happen, giving the young hero plenty of opportunities to save the day and one day become Superman.

8037504,4,B00062J120,"For the longest time, I was afraid to watch Smallville.

One day, my older brother (of all people), turned me on to Season 1.

It wasn't long before I had purchased all the seasons available and another on the way.

Obviously, you know the show's scenario.  But to me, the most riveting part of the show - every show - is seeing how Clark and his family deal with keeping his identity a secret from those around him.

Clark's morality is that of honesty (you know, Truth, Justice and the American Way).  Yet, in order to remain a viable member of the community, he must continually lie!  And this moral yin-yang is what what drives the show, in this man's opinion.

Yes, there is almost always a ""girlie love interest thang"" going on.  Sometimes, it's hard for a 42 year old man like myself to deal with it.  My friends can't believe I watch Smallville...

But I cannot help myself!  Smallville is an extremely exciting show that I would recommend to anyone who wants to see one of the finest shows ever on television.  The acting is really superb.  Michael Rosenbaum (who plays Lex Luthor) is great as a young adult who continuously struggles to find himself - and who seems to see himself - in Clark Kent (Tom Welling).

For the most part, it's an extremely family-oriented show.  Every now and then you hear a curse word but nothing like most of the shows you see on TV these days.

A fun show no doubt, but more a trip about what happens to people's relationship's with others when they hide the truth - and VERY well done, to boot.",1125014400,2,1536,4.428571428571429
8037505,5,B00062J120,"I had never seen Smallville before I got this.  I wasn't expecting much, but after a couple episodes I was hooked.  I watched all 3 seasons in less than 2 weeks.  I can't wait for the 4th season to come out on DVD as well as the 5th to start on TV.  If you are a superman fan, this set is worth it.",1123545600,,298,3.6825396825396823
8037506,5,B00062J120,"Allright a little background on my introduction will explain the addictive power of this show...  Never have been one to have a ""show"" that I have to watch every week, especially not something from the juvenile WB!!  So when my roommate pulled this out and started watching the first disc of season 1 that he had borrowed from a friend, my basic reaction was something akin to, ""You're not going to watch that teenie bopper, soap-opera stuff in here are you?""  But having nothing else to do, and having no choice to watch since he was watching it on MY TV, I watched about 4 episodes with him.  At that point my question became, ""So when can you borrow the next disc?!""  And I've been hooked ever since, having watched (and purchased) all 4 seasons now.

The great thing about this series is that you watch not only the progression of the characters throughout the series, but also the progression of the show's writers.  Admittedly, Season 1 really doesn't have a contiuous fluid story line.  Each episode tends to be simply about Clark saving one of his friends (some of whom get annoyingly whiny from time-to-time) while struggling with his ""teenage-ishness.""  And while there are flashes and referneces to his personal progression, it just isn't consistant.  Things take off quickly with Season 2, however, and don't look back.  The characters only become more interesting as time progresses, and by Season 3, even Chloe (who you almost want Clark to just let die most of season 1) is wrapped intriguingly into the plotline.  I would have to say that as enjoyable as most of the characters are, Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor is really the glue of this series.  As you watch his  continued struggle down into his dark-nature, you find yourself rooting for him to gain that core of decency he recognizes and desires in Clark's personality.  Rosenbaum (along with John Glover as Lionel Luther) is truly the great acting talent of this series.  I could go on in describing his character, but I will let you enjoy discovering it for yourselves.

The final thing I would like to say in praise of this series is that I very much enjoy the positive interplay between Welling's Clark and both of his parents.  While I know people don't watch TV anymore to gleen moral tidbits, I find it refreshing that a popular TV show can portray a famliy's relationship as a healthy one.  One in which the teen, in the midst of his obvious struggles to discover the truth about himself, is willing to seek his parents advice and counsel; and in which the parents are supportive of him stepping into his own maturity as a young adult.  Do they have issues from time-to-time like a normal family?  Of course, but the general impression created is that this is a family that loves and supports each other through the best and worst of times.

WATCH THIS SERIES!!!  You will enjoy it.",1122508800,2,2863,4.693386773547094
8037507,5,B00062J120,"I can't help but think of Tom Welling's comment on the WB Insider special about Michael Rosenbaum being a greater actor than Marlon Brando.  In a way i have to agree with him, Rosenbaum has show phenominal acting skills as the young Lex Luthor.  I continue to whatch with intruge as he slowly continues on his path to the ""dark side"".  The season 4 episode ""Onyx"" is just one milstone in that path.

The season 3 episode ""Talisman"" is yet another moment where Clark must question whether his greatest enemy is to be either Lionel or Lex(both have the potential to be very VERY evil).  And i must say that John Glover plays an excelent role as evil father to Lex.

Aswell as Terance Stamp who is the voice of Jor'el, has created compeling character.  No one ever could have believed that Jor'el was an evil person, yet we see that through the eyes of Clark.  Later in season 4 you learn that he his not accually and evil as Clark thinks.  *Insert Spoiler Here*

This collection is a MUST for any avid Superman fan!  With the new movie soon to come out it will be hard to adjust the new actors.  In my eyes Tom Welling is the BEST Superman second only to Christopher Reeves(Rest In Peace).  Mike Rosenbaum is the best Lex Luthor second to John Shea(Lois and Clark series).",1121644800,,1270,4.422413793103448
8037508,5,B00062J120,"The show is great I think most reviewers agree. Buying all three seasons saved me some extra bucks that I would have spent had I purchased each season separately, however, I understand that a new package is on the way which includes the 4th season in a nice collectors-packaging, so you may want to wait a while.",1110326400,13,312,4.491228070175438
8037509,5,B00062J120,"As a long-time fan of Superman, I was somewhat skeptical about the story being retold.  I also admit that I did not watch the show initially, because I felt that it could not compare to my ""Christopher Reeve vision"" of Superman.  However, I soon realized that ""Smallville"" brings a fresh and exciting twist to a legendary character and story.  The idea to show Clark coming to grips with his roots is nothing short of genius!  The best part of this series, however, is the elegance of the storytelling.  While we are given the superheroic escapades (sans tights and cape of course), the character development is what really makes this show a winner.  From the pilot episode, you can't help being drawn into the feelings of each character.  With the number of characters on the show, it would be easy to leave some of them unattended.  I feel that bringing Jonathan and Martha to the forefront is a key to the show's appeal.  If there can be a downside for me, it would be that I am going to have a hard time disliking Lex and making room for Lois!

I have also been pleased with the creativity involved in the development of storylines.  While we all know the basic story, there have been numerous twists to keep the viewer intrigued.

Casting note:  This show has been brilliantly cast.  Tom Welling is absolutely perfect as Clark Kent--he really does come across as your next-door neighbor, while also pulling off the superheroic feats with ease.  Tom is also a master at playing a guy in the throes of high school angst.  John Schneider is probably my second favorite cast member just because I think the father/son relationship between him and Tom Welling is so well crafted.  Kristin Kreuk, Michael Rosenbaum, Annette O'Toole, Allison Mack, Sam Jones, Eric Johnson, and John Glover also give top-notch performances and make their characters incredibly believable.

On a final note to all of you die-hard Superman fans:  You will not be disappointed, even if you already have an ealier version established in you mind as the best of the best.  I have learned that I can appreciate every version--Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Gerard Christopher, as well as the Superfriends, Justice League, and all of ther other animated versions of the character.

Your superhero collection is not complete without this series, but the appeal of ""Smallville"" goes far beyond that of a superhero fan.  Buy it today!!!!!",1108857600,10,2433,4.840193704600484
