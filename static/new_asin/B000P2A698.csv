8726254,2,B000P2A698,"Mine is a long story, but I have been studying the Martial Arts for over 39 years and I bought this DVD just to learn Tensho Kata.  I first saw this kata demonstrated by Gosen Yamaguchi in August of 1977 when I visited Tokyo to train under his father Master Gogen Yamaguchi  with my Sensei and 12 other members of our Dojo. This form was not part of our System and I have only seen this form demonstrated in person one other time in my career by another Goju-ryu practioner and I now realize that there are great fundamental differences between the theory and practice of Sanchin in Isshinryu and Goju-ryu. While I do appreciate the authors faster and lighter interpretation of this form and his mastery of it, this video is a very poor instructional tool. With all of my years of experience I can follow the tape and the authors moves and I've just about got it down now after only a few minutes of seriously study, and I do want to thank this videos producers for teaching me this form that I have wanted to learn all of these years, but unfortunately the video was made so poorly that I can not recommend it as an instructional tool for either the beginner or a novice student of the arts. This video appears to have been produced in VHS in the Authors Home sometime in the 1990s (Im guessing) and to have later been converted from VHS to DVD format. The images are blurred and there is no instructional narration to this video.  The moves are explained by a scrolling marquee overlay that moves too fast to be read to be of any practical instructional use to its intended audience and the Author moves so quickly that his moves are very difficult for anyone other than an advanced practitioner of this or another similar art to follow.",1384646400,3,1739,4.445141065830721
