7969649,5,B00006IUIL,"This show starts out crazy and just keeps going further off the deep end.  If you want serious drama this is not for you, but if you're in the mood for a zany buddy series this is it!  Our band of skilled yet perpetually broke bounty hunters can't even seem to pay their tab at the local coffee shop/pub.  And to make matters worse Natsumi and Sakura don't have hunter's licenses.  What are they to do?",1038182400,,402,4.25
