2533501,5,B000ET2T74,"This was better than I ever imagined.  No wonder it received many awards, it was seriously amazing.  The story itself is just mind boggling, but the scenery and commentary were fantastic.  The 2nd DVD of the making of the documentary was fantasic as well.  It's also very family friendly, with only 1 swear word that was bleeped out.  We watched it on Christmas day with my whole family, and everyone was just amazed.  Truly a great DVD to own!",1199232000,5,444,4.556962025316456
2533502,5,B000ET2T74,"This stunning movie deserves much more attention than it has received to date.  A story well told, it contains beautiful, crisp cinematography of the mountain scenery all the way up;  nearly flawless editing that moves at a thoughtful measured pace - built by the painfully long, evocative shot of Erik crossing the first iceladder - interviews that highlight the human side - and of course, the incredible climber himself.

Erik, understated, modest, optimistic and determined, with a sense of humor and a commitment to achieve, is a classic American hero.

See it, be inspired, and share it widely as this film deserves.",1182038400,8,622,5.068627450980392

2533563,4,B000ET2T74,"I confess I am an Everest junkie.  I read and watch just about everything on Everest.  This was a nice movie,
but it did not go into enough depth about the difficulties this young man faced.  The Khumbu icefalls are where
most Sherpas loose their life.  To trek that without sight, I cannot imagine.  Maybe if they made it more comprehensive
the documentary would have been too long.  Maybe I just wanted to see more than the average viewer.  I would
highly recommend it, but i wanted more.  I wanted more, because, after you saw ""more"" you would be drastically
impressed by what he endured.

Are we really climbing Everest like Hillary and Tenzing did????  Now we have the Sherpas to set our trails, install
the ropes, align the ladders, cook for us, etc, etc.  Is a climber interested in doing it the way Hillary did it???

I believe the Sherpas should get paid more than $6,000 per season, when the average cost of an American accomplishing
this is about $85,000.  I met a lady who had climbed to basecamp.  She told me if you paid them enough, the
Sherpas would carry you up.

2533568,5,B000ET2T74,"Without saying everything that everyone else has written (which is all true) I will say, this documentary is worth sharing with others. At 50 minutes, there is enough information about Eric, the blind man who climbed Mt Everest,  the support of his team, and the connecting relationships between them all. It was the perfect length to capture what was necessary to convey the story,  the importance and magnitude of his climb, and the ambition and commitment to make it happen. One of the things that I appreciate best is you can tell he is doing it for himself. At the end, there is not a clip of him boasting for the camera. His group was proud, but it was clear it was for their own achievement, especially Eric's, and the fact they were a part of it. Before the credits, there is a list of ""Firsts"" from this climb. This includes: first blind person to reach the summit, first HD film from the summit, largest group to reach the summit, and a few others.

This is awe-inspiring, I give the man props. I recommend this for anyone who wants to step out of their everyday life (for only less than an hour!) into something that is better than fiction: real life greatness. Well done.",1390435200,,1183,4.518691588785047

2533578,3,B000ET2T74,"Since reading Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer, I have watched many documentaries about Mount Everest.  This one certainly does a good job of covering some of the obstacles faced by having a blind person attempt the climb.  What it was lacking was information on how much support it takes for the climbers, of any ability, to make it to the summit.  I was very disappointed that the sherpas were barely mentioned.  In the credits, I was shocked to see that Phurba Tashi, who is the most widely-known name among sherpas and has summited Everest 21 times as of 2013, wasn't even mentioned.  Those men risk their lives putting up those ropes, carrying those oxygen bottles and setting up those camps so that people can even have a chance at the summit.

2533583,5,B000ET2T74,"In DVD of the month ""Farther Than the Eye Can See,"" by Michael Brown, Everest skies are jewel-blue in this high-definition documentary. Erik Weihenmayer, star of ""Farther Than the Eye Can See,"" cannot see their hues, yet the blind climber perceives the scenery: ""I can ... hear that there's these big mountains around us."" These are the moments that bring this very beautiful -- in many senses -- film home. ""Farther than the Eye Can See,"" was nominated for two Emmys (Best Sports Documentary and Best Sports Cinematography). Filmed with almost preposterous clarity, from inventive, changing angles, and using moody time-lapses and little narration, the film takes us into the experience of a man climbing this endless mountain without being able to see a single step. Crossing a ladder over a crevasse, Weihenmayer taps his front points onto one rung, bends to feel the side rail with his hand, touches his heel to the previous rung; then covers both rungs. ""Sometimes people assume that if you can't see how far you're going to fall you're not afraid,"" he narrates. ""But sometimes I think falling into the unknown is scarier."" At the summit a teammate says, ""Erik, man, you did it. So many people doubted you, you showed 'em."" Yet in the next frame comes this most natural outburst from Kevin Cherilla, basecamp manager: ""Erik, I love, you man, you are the f--in' best! You are the baddest dude on the planet, over..."" The film also could have scratched the subplots of other Everest ""firsts"" on the expedition (first father-son team to summit; oldest climber, recently broken) It's what he did that we want to fathom, and the film illuminates. As much as anything could. -- Alison Osius",1306627200,7,1689,4.888501742160279
