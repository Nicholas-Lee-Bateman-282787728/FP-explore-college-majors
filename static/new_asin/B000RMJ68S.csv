2869565,3,B000RMJ68S,"A depressed young woman who has visions about an accident which eventually caused the death of her older sister returns home to visit her creepy brother-in-law and niece. While there, the niece's grandmother dies and she has a vision right before it happens. The niece confides that there is something 'inside the walls' which is responsible. Some kind of monster. During the course of the investigation, she discovers the house used to be an escape route for local minors and the house is riddled with mysterious hatches and bolt holes.

Initially I found this film suspenseful. But I grew bored waiting for the big reveal. The grandmother, and child, were excessively creepy, and I think it would've been more interesting if the characters were more normal even likeable. The house itself was interesting, but it was never explained why the miners felt the need to make *a house* into an escape hatch for the mines. It would make more sense if the house was part of the Underground Railway or something. Also the house was very dark and drab and in an obvious bid to make it look scary, I think they went to far.  It was difficult for me to believe anyone would want to live there.

Overall, this was an okay film. If you like the type of film where no one believes the central character isn't crazy until the very end, this one is for you. I found myself unsatisfied with the ending and impatient towards the end for things to happen. The final scene rang hollow and was anti-climatic.

3 stars. Not the worst horror I've seen but not all that great either.",1189036800,9,1560,4.620938628158845

2869567,4,B000RMJ68S,"Slow burn, eerie, atmospheric mystery/thriller. Excellent acting by the lead actress really made this film stand out. Recommend.",1404518400,,128,6.166666666666667
2869568,5,B000RMJ68S,"Another good choice, but you have to like scary and weird movies to get in to it, If you like horror you will love this one.",1389139200,,124,3.8076923076923075
2869569,5,B000RMJ68S,"This movie was not a huge ""spent all the budget in the world"" movie, but the make up was good in all the grizzlies & the story line was something not seen around. I loved the twists of this movie. Everyone should watch. It is intriguing. Is it a horror, suspense, or just a psycho movie? Hmmm.... maybe she is crazy... maybe theres something out to get her.... GO! discover it with her!! Awesome movie!",1378857600,,402,4.373333333333333
2869570,4,B000RMJ68S,"More of a mystery than a thriller. Christy feels guilty for causing an accident, which disfigures her sister, Vanessa. She has flashbacks of the tragic events (and general horrible visions) and draws what she sees in a notebook. Some of the images have yet to occur. A sense of obligation compels her to visit her sister's husband, John and his daughter, Amy. Their household is now run by John's creepy mother (picture Mrs. Danvers.) Christy senses someone else in the house (as does Amy.) She is intent on proving that Vanessa was buried alive, because she saw it in one of her visions. She begins to believe that John and Vanessa's nurse, Claire Wells conspired to kill Vanessa. John insists that Christy leave town or face being arrested by her police friend, Jeff. The ending was rather predictable and somewhat sad, but ultimately for the best, I think. This is a pretty clean movie with only slightly disturbing images. I wouldn't eat dinner while watching it, but I've seen worse depictions of violence in regular TV programs.",1272153600,,1034,4.8474576271186445
2869571,4,B000RMJ68S,"i had really low expectations going in to this movie.mainly because of the words MTV films appearing on the screen.so i was really surprised at how well done this psychological suspense thriller was.i found it very atmospheric,and suspenseful.there weren't a lot of cheap scares.it was intelligent,and well written,in my opinion.the ending was unexpected.i was also very impressed with the acting. Nora Zehetner as Christy was very good,but Matthew Settle as John really impressed.basically,my opinion of MTV films went up several notches after this film was over.for me,Beneath is a well deserved 4/5",1268611200,,601,5.543478260869565
2869572,4,B000RMJ68S,"Don't let he MTV logo on the box affect your decision to see this! I was surprised to see that there is a solid story here, characters with personalities, some great acting, and no cheesy nudity. A girl returns to the town she grew up in after a number of years away to attend a funeral. She had been sent away after her sister's funeral with a brother-in-law and niece as her onlt family left. She starts to have blackouts, visions through sketches, and people begin to die. It even has some dark and creepy elements. I recommend this and I would watch it again, even own it.
There is nothing ""MTV"" about this movie! :)",1201737600,2,620,4.353448275862069
2869573,4,B000RMJ68S,"this movie was something else. after i saw it, i was a bit in shock. all good things of course. very well thought out. plain and simple: it was very good. it's hard these days to bring something to the screen that kind of gets you a bit on edge, something a bit unnerving you know. and this did all that. it's not a big blockbuster movie, but it far from sux too. very mysterious and suspenseful. just when you think you got it all figured out, it isn't always so. take this chic who's coming back to her home town after years of struggling and trying to escape the painful memories of her sisters death, caused in part by her. the guilt is and has always been there, but so have visions of her sister and that unfortunate day. she ran from her past, but as always she must face it one day. somthing keeps telling her, that something is not right. visions, drawings, and dreams have followed her for years and make her want to uncover the truth. the truth that lies hidden beneath. just her and her young niece seem to be the only ones to believe that there is a dark thing, when everyone else thinks she's crazy. she has to do what she can to prove them wrong. in the end, it's more than even she thought it would be. very successful film in my eyes. the acting was quite good, the all around feeling you get when you watch this is an eerie one. nothing like good old fashion thrills to give you some good chills.",1199750400,,1414,4.202205882352941
2869574,3,B000RMJ68S,"....is a coherent script.  Even with that in mind, BENEATH, an MTV co-production with Paramount, holds your interest with a modicum of shrieks.  HEROES' Nora Zehetner plays Christie, a young girl traumatized by the death of her sister, in an accident in which she was the driver.  Although she survived the crash, Vanessa was burned severely and dies a year later.  When people close to Vanessa start dying, Christie is convinced there's more to Vanessa's death than meets the eye.
One major problem I found is Christie's ""visions"" and her drawings of things and people she doesn't know...there is no real explanation for them, and when the script force feeds a reason, it doesn't make sense.  Zehetner is good, as is Matthew Settle as her brother in law.  Not bad, but no classic either.",1192838400,2,788,4.843283582089552
2869575,3,B000RMJ68S,"You know what would be great?  How about an original idea instead of just rehashing the same old plots over and over again.  How many times do we have to suffer through somebody dying or being injured in a car accident or a fire (here it was both) then watch the tortured survivor friend or relative deal with it later in life?  This movie wasn't terrible, but there was absolutely nothing new in it anywhere that hasn't been done in dozens of other movies.  There were pictures drawn of visions someone had (boy, that's original), a little kid viewing all the happenings (only for the hundreth time I think) and of course the cover up of the plot that gives us the same old twist at the end.  A real twist would be that there is no twist at the end.  I gave it 3 stars because the acting wasn't bad and had it been one of the first 10 or so movies I'd seen with this same theme I probably would have liked it more.",1189814400,,915,4.170454545454546
8201407,5,B000RMJ68S,"This movie was OK as a horror film, but I give it 5 stars because it made me feel very sad for the way Vanessa is treated after being burnt in a car accident. On top of that, her family ends up ruined. I knew it was only makeup (a VERY good job on actress Heather Feeney!), but something about the idea of a beautiful woman having to go through life after she's horribly burned just tears me up inside. One should never, EVER let a young chld watch this movie.",1483747200,2,460,4.065934065934066

8201409,4,B000RMJ68S,"So I just watched this movie on Netflix and I wasn't sure how I felt through out the movie. Overall it was a good movie.  I thought the lead actress did a great job.

The younger sister comes back home after some time away. She got her and her sister in a terrible car accident which ultimately let to her sisters death. But something doesn't seem right so she starts looking into her sisters death.  You pretty much know what's going to happen but it's still a good psychological thriller. I didn't like the ending though. It was pretty sad :-(",1462320000,,545,4.376237623762377
8201410,2,B000RMJ68S,"The premise for the film is good. The other actors are fine, but the lead is SO AWFUL. No matter what is happening, she has the same blank, uninterested, not frightened face. It was so frustrating and took me right out of the story. She ruined it and I don't understand why she wasn't replaced.",1459900800,,294,4.363636363636363

I love watching movies that are a little bit creepy and suspenseful because you never know what is going to happen. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seats and it isn't very predictable like a lot of scary movies now days.,1428192000,2,334,4.153846153846154

8201416,1,B000RMJ68S,"Beneath is a movie so bad it needs to be seen to be believed...but the confirmation is nowhere near worth the amount of time and brain cells you'll lose. My daughter and I are both horror flick buffs, and I found this at a Big Lots for 2 bucks. I figured, what the heck? It's only a couple of dollars. However, the movie is so very terrible, I felt as though I'd been swindled out of my life's savings. It's unlikely too many people will be looking to buy this stinker on Amazon, but if my words act as a warning to even one soul....then maybe I can forgive myself for sitting through this thing.",1419465600,3,596,4.191304347826087
