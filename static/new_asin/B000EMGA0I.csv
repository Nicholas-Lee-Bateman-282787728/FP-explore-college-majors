2522444,5,B000EMGA0I,"This DVD contains many of the short hand crafted personal Experimental Narrative/Avant Garde films i made between 2001- 2006. Many of my films are hybrids of Live Action and rare techniques of Animation containing spiritual themes told from a surrealistic approuch. My work covers a wide range of themes, techniques, structures and cryptographic symbolism yet remains coherantly part of an overall aesthetic message or body. Those who might enjoy this DVD would probably be lovers of Hayao Miyasaki,  Jan Svankmajer, Guy Maddin, Bros Quay and alas Tim Burton among others. Enjoy!",1148860800,13,579,5.362637362637362

8111173,2,B000EMGA0I,"Eric has released all of his creativity in the first two minutes and it was so impressive that I forced myself to sit through the remainder. I hope he reads this as a praise of the work he did in ""The Forest"". I was so excited when I watched ""The Forest"" that I watched it about ten times before continuing. When I did continue, I thought the next short film was from another film maker or maybe a bad joke. There was nothing else I would ever suggest anyone watch but the first two minutes. Please expound upon that in which you show talent.",1321315200,,542,4.221153846153846
8111174,4,B000EMGA0I,"I found this and thought it might be good. Just arrived in the mail and I've started watching it. I'm impressed! Has many qualities akin to the Quay Brothers and Jan Svankmajer. I wouldn't say these shorts rank as well as these greats, but one can see the lineage for sure. As a film stident, I can appreciate much of the experimentation and BEAUTIFUL soundtrack. These films are made by the Leiser Brothers, one directing, and one making the music. A 13-minute documentary on the two is included with the dvd. The images and sound on the shorts complement eachother well. There are a couple misfires, such as the first short, FOREST, but the rest are well-made film experiences. I recommend getting this DVD if you've exhausted the collected Shorts of Jan Svankmajer.",1294012800,,768,4.7819548872180455
8111175,4,B000EMGA0I,"So, Im a painter. I mention this not because you care, but because it relates to why I like this [not really eclectic] compilation of shorts. These are four very subdued, similar in style, abstract mostly animated shorts-- three of which feature at least some stop motion, most of which are very heavy on richly colored, semi-fuzzy looking landscapes shot with an 8mm camera. There is little to no dialogue happening in any of the shorts, and low key music through out. I loved it, and it only misses out on a star because the last short incorporated the bible in a cheesy, unattractive way I did not enjoy. Bottom line: eclectic shorts isn't for everybody, but if you're into film as an art form, youll dig it.",1280016000,3,711,4.5625
8111176,3,B000EMGA0I,"This DVD features the stop-motion short ""The Forest"" as the first piece on this DVD, it is interesting, shows promise, but the rest of the DVD takes a steep dive from there-- there's some limited animation in the next few films, but the later features are little more than scored home movies of someone's trip in central Europe.

It is really rather too early in this animator's career for this sort of retrospective, this release was premature in 2006, and is frustratingly so in 2010. Maybe in another 10 years, when the animator has a wider body of work these early films will be more of interest in comparison, but right now, most of it is just stale amateur film that most people won't care to sit through. Comparisons to Jan Svankmajer, Jiri Barta, the Brothers Quay are equally premature based on the work shown in this DVD.

I only paid $2 + S&H for this, so I can't complain, ""The Forest"" is worth that, but I'll never watch the rest of the DVD again. Most but the most obsessive animation fan can take a pass on this DVD.",1278892800,2,1031,4.449735449735449
8111177,5,B000EMGA0I,"Produced between 2001 and 2006, this collection of animated shorts from the uncommon mind of Erik Leiser reveals the artist's unique vision and otherworldly aesthetic. By mixing color and black-and-white, live action and stop-motion, and puppetry and pixilation techniques, Leiser has created a animation style that's drawn comparisons to that of Jan Svankmajer and Tim Burton yet remains distinctly his own.",1230508800,,408,5.704918032786885
8111178,1,B000EMGA0I,"after reading the product description, i had pretty high expectations for this. let me just tell you, these shorts have nothing in common with jan svankmajer, the brothers quay, or tim burton. they're mostly long meandering shots of landscapes. each short feels as long as kubrick's 2001. i also bought eric leiser's feature, ""imagination"" and liked it quite a bit. i suggest anyone interested in him buy imagination instead.",1227657600,3,425,5.173913043478261
8111179,4,B000EMGA0I,"A very surprising collection from someone promoted for his association with MTV. These films vary in style quite a bit, but the overwhelming feeling is one of reverential beauty and metaphysical search. The relationship of the filmmaker with his composer brother also comes across strongly, both in the work and in the supplementary material. The Leiser brothers eschew the rapid-fire facile flashiness of so much current motion work, and replace it with contemplative and spacious explorations of landscape and spirituality, both internal and external. Not for the impatient, or those in need of conventional narrative structures, but very rewarding for anyone willing to allow an opening in the mind for the Leiser's particular vision.",1186185600,,737,5.473684210526316
8111180,5,B000EMGA0I,"This collection of works will be treasured as the early work of two young Visionaries- a must for any connoisseur of the Avant-Garde. What emerges in it- through it- is a unique and powerful synthetic Vision that vibrates with positive intent- that of Wonder. We need not compare it to Burton or any of the `Masters' because what emerges here is no mere mimicry of previous filmmakers- but a sensitive and skilled adaptation and elaboration of film language- crafted and emerging as its own unique voice or I should say duet- maybe chorus? Burton and Svankmejer- even the Brothers Quay did not have such collaboration- such cohesion with their soundtracks, and indeed Jeffery Leiser's soundtracks are intimately linked with the images of his brother- adding levels and depths of motion, colour and life through sound. And as for my own tastes- indeed the Leiser Brothers are far less tritely morbid, serialized and clichd as Burton and far more symbolically sophisticated. Eric Leiser's work is far more joyfully mystical and whimsical than Svankmejer- but it contains within it similar eerie and uncanny boundaries crossed between animate and inanimate; animal, vegetable and mineral. The Quay Brothers Animate a dead world- a world of identification with objects and dead matter- nothing is ever quite alive. The Leiser Brothers see a world in which everything is deeply infused with life and light- a Vision, it could be said, which is highly infectious- in a good way.",1172016000,5,1472,5.086776859504132
8111181,2,B000EMGA0I,"This dvd is not what it appears to be . Yes the first short ""Forest"" clocks in at about 2 minutes, and is somewhat interesting in that it does resemble some of the qualities of the 'masters' supposed to be an influence, however the remaining shorts are not much more than hand held home movies shot on one's first vacation. The new Tim Burton, I hardly think so. Let's wait a few years before we start comparing ourselves to the Quays or Svankmajer or Tim Burton. I want my money back!  Oh yeah, the music is not bad though.  Keep trying!!",1162857600,10,539,4.326732673267327
