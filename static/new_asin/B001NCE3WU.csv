8323463,2,B001NCE3WU,"I purchased this video specifically because I enjoy watching John Zaffis' new television program ""The Haunted Collector.""  Unfortunately, this video doesn't measure up.  It's 35 minutes of John and his investigators recounting their experiences at the Hotel Vernon, with a few dramatizations,orb videos and EVP's thrown in, in an attempt to keep things moving.  While production qualities are top-notch, they fail to rescue this rather dull video.  Those of us who are ""armchair investigators"" want to see paranormal investigations in the process -- not listen to accounts of personal experiences.  I truly expected better from the ""Godfather of the Paranormal.""",1311897600,,662,5.58
8323464,4,B001NCE3WU,"I kind of liked this DVD because of the presence of Veteran ghost hunter John Zaffis. John is the nephew of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and therefore tops in his field. I wish there were more episodes of this available.
Now, I did not like the recreation of some of the encounters. It comes off as unreal and a little too cheesy. My question would be at this point, if you are taping and investigating, why the recreation, why was it not caught on camera?
The group featured in here is more professional in their approach than some I've seen, and they certainly at least presented some convincing evps and other evidence from the hotel. I think this is a good dvd for what it is.",1258848000,,675,4.365079365079365
8323465,4,B001NCE3WU,"This DVD appears to be a pilot or at least an individual episode of a future TV series.  The star is John Zaffis who most people know as the nephew of Ed Warren and a paranormal expert/demonologist. It's a well made little documentary of the haunted Hotel Vernon in Worcester, MA.  I hope they make more of these episodes at other haunted sites.  I didn't give it 5 stars for 2 reasons, one I'm not a big fan of dramatizations and they do use them in this show (they mix them in with the actual investigation footage).  Second is the opening and closing scenes with Zaffis dressed in a suit and tie being billed as the ""godfather"" of paranormal investigating walking through a cemetary introducing the episode (kinda cheesy).  I'm sure this was done in an effort to sell the series to a network, so hey...whatever it takes.  At any rate the price is excellent and the content is very good. Like I said I hope they make more DVDs with John Zaffis because he's got some great experiences to share.",1239408000,4,995,4.469613259668508
