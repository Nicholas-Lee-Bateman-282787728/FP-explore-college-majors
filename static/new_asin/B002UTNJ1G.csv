8381531,5,B002UTNJ1G,"I am THRILLED to have stumbled upon this! Was just randomly Googling for Mr. McMaster / D.T.  (News, possible upcoming live dates, any new music, etc)
And saw this!  Despite being a fan of Jason since his Watchtower days, I was only lucky enough to see  DT live, ONCE (1990-91 Operation Rock n Roll)  I wish I could change that... but Jason and Co don't often play outside the Austin area.  This, combined with me being a Californian, means that it's pretty unlikely that I'll ever get a chance to enjoy these guys live again.  Except on this DVD!  The video is exactly what I wanted, hoped it would be....the camerawork was perfect.  Choppy yet totally watchable,  this wasn't PRO-SHOT, nor was it supposed to be.  Not for a true DT fan.  This isn't a Bon Jovi show.  Who would even think that it should be shot like one?  If you've ever been to a show at all like this, watching this DVD is the closest thing I could imagine to actually being there, and I THANK GOD that they did it in true D.T. style. Raw, Rude, and ROCKING!",1478649600,,1028,4.347368421052631

8381535,5,B002UTNJ1G,Great sound quality. a great selection of songs. I wish it was on a larger stage. Overall though an awesome show. Well worth the money if your a Dangerous Toys fan from back in the 80's.,1293667200,,186,4.194444444444445
8381536,2,B002UTNJ1G,"Cr*ppy in house video !

His high vocals were shot...he could have backed off a little it would have helped !

Mixing board / sound guy was asleep...would have been nice to hear the lead guitar without turning my volume to 99%.

I've always dug the ""TOYS"" but this was a cr*p release from a band that can still rock.

Watched once and  shelved ( to remove from active service - to put off or aside )",1269561600,2,399,4.12987012987013
8381537,5,B002UTNJ1G,"I purchased this locally, with a releaase like this you never know what to expect.  I've gambled and lost a few times on brand newly released music DVDs, (bad sound, picture, camera work, editing, etc). Not the case with the Toys XX.  Its great that they decided to put this together because they don't make fun, greasy, smokey, sleezy rock like this anymore.

Firstly thank you guys.  Now on with the show.  The setting is a bar in Austin TX, small stage and it appears to be a crowd of about 100 apprx.  The guys are nearly shoulder to shoulder on stage.  My favorite part about this, is that there are only a few cameras 4 to 6 max and at least three maybe four are held by people in the crowd (shakey, in a good way), or near the stage.  Almost each of the cameras gives a different picture quality.  The less quality footage could be from '89 easily, and then there is sharp (pro?) picture for awhile, and a few variations in between.  There is nothing in the concert that would give any indication that it is a recent show (McMaster looks and sounds the same as back in the day), so the ""grainy"" footage is a cool effect, on purpose or not.  The editing is great and raw, no crazy jumping around (but when it does it is well placed).  Im not an audiophile, but the sound is as good as any concert DVD I have (apprx 75).

You get 21 songs on the DVD, all but one (Feels like a Hammer)from the debut. This is how it should be done, Im sure they could chopped it down to ten or 12 songs and no one would have known the difference:

1. Gunfighter*
2. Outlaw
3. Sugar Leather & the Nail
4. Take Me Drunk
5. Gimme No Lip
6. Bones in the Gutter
7. Ten Boots
8. Angel N.U.*
9. Queen of the NIle
10. Pissed*
11. PainTrain*
12. Here Comes Trouble
13. Sportin a Woody
14. Line em Up
15. That Dog
16. Strange*
17. Oh Well, So What*
18. Demon Bell*
19. Hard Luck Champion*
20. Teasn' Pleasn'
21. Scared

*Songs not on included CD, but availble for download.

Highlights for me are Take Me Drunk, Ten Boots, Line Em Up (funky) and Scared.  Teasn' was missing something, not sure what, otherwise JM and the band was tight throughout.  If you are looking at this, you likely are more familiar with a majority of their work than their most popular song. Its 92 minutes total, no special features or booklet, but for the price it is a steal if you are even a casual fan of DT or sleazy 80s rock.  BUY THIS, shake on it and call it even, EH?",1264809600,11,2428,4.160599571734475
