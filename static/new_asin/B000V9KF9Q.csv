8217548,5,B000V9KF9Q,"I saw this movie years ago with my daughters and we all wanted to see it again.

Katey Sagal is excellent (so different from her Married with Children role).

Buying this movie after seeing it so long ago is, I feel, a huge compliment.",1392681600,2,235,4.318181818181818
8217549,5,B000V9KF9Q,"Because Katey Sagal was in it and she is just Amazing as a person and a Actor.

8217550,5,B000V9KF9Q,"I really like this movie. I love Charlotte Ross and Katey Segal and they worked well together. I believed every aspect of this movie and I loved the story. It really shows how kids are today. Or at least when I went to school.
Loved it - you should watch it!",1341705600,2,258,4.078431372549019
8217551,1,B000V9KF9Q,The movie is awful. Quality good but movie is boring and very low budget. Katy Segal is about the only thing good in this movie. It was nothing like I expected...I haven't even finished watching it.,1341014400,,198,4.527777777777778
8217552,4,B000V9KF9Q,"This movie was a more of a drama, and was relatively interesting. I watched it while I was writing a paper for my PhD program, and was still able to follow the movie...most of the excitement was towards the end of the picture. Katey Sagal (from Married With Children) was one of the stars in this show...I'm not sure who the other actors/actresses were, but they were all good.",1231977600,,377,4.478260869565218
8217553,3,B000V9KF9Q,"The movie was base on high school best friends Vicky,Ashkey and Justine seem to have it all; Justine is dating the school's most popular guy. However, when Vicky ends up murdered after a huge fight with Ashley and Justine,their golden girl status is ruined and everyone suspects that Ashley and Justine are responsible for Vicky's death. Ashley and Justice know much more than they are letting on and for good reason. If they reveal their secret,they reveal their motive. Now,this doesn't neccessary mean,than Ashley,and Justine murder Vicky. Justine mother Susan(Katey Sagal)whom cast in Love and Marriage sitcom,is convinced of her daughter's innocence...at least at first. To all viewers I don't want to tell to much,either rent the movie or make it part of your dvd collection. The movie is worth seeing.....in my opinion. Some movies has twist and turns. This wasn't hard for me to figure out. I guess,the director of the film sort of made it possible for the viewers to see what happens next. For example,when I watch BASIC INSTINCT..... had to watch the movie twice,in order to get a full understanding. This movie somewhat reveal who the real killer,is towards the end of the movie.",1215993600,8,1190,5.015151515151516
