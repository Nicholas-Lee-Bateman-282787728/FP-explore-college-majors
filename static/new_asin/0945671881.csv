172266,4,0945671881,"This is a good tape to do when you don't have a lot of time. It is a little hard to follow. Patricia is very flexible, but even though you may not be able to copy her, it definitely gives you something to strive for.",982368000,2,216,3.8222222222222224
172267,3,0945671881,"Intermediates will reap benefits from this video, which helps expand the chest after a day of slouching forward.  However, unless you have some previous experience with yoga, or unless you are relatively physically fit,  Walden's routine on PM Yoga may leave you feeling a little sore in the  morning.  The pacing can be rather quick - especially during the more  active vinyasas in the middle - so it would be best to view the tape at  least once before trying the poses.  Better yet, try out one of Walden's  other videos, Yoga Journal's Yoga for Beginners, a gentler intro. to yoga,  common poses and yoga props.  Then you will be more prepared for pm yoga  and the other ""for beginners"" videos in the Yoga Journal series.",960422400,19,725,4.674603174603175
172268,1,0945671881,"The advertising on the cover of this tape is so misleading as to be false.  The cover says the tape is for beginners, ""easy-to-use"", ""help you release stress and tension"", ""designed for people  of all ages and levels of fitness"".  It also shows pictures of people  in fairly ordinary positions like sitting Indian style and standing.  I did  not find the tape to be any of these things.  If you are not more than 20  pounds overweight, quite flexible, and already know and can do the basic  yoga positions, then this tape may be for you.  Of course, then you are not  really a beginner.  Futhermore, a yoga program that needs blocks, straps  and a mat is not for beginners.  (They don't tell you the tape uses these  things on the cover.)  In some of the positions I was so unstable that I  was flapping and hopping just to stay upright -- not tension-relieving.  Some of the positions required so much endurance that I was panting very  hard merely to hold them -- not relaxing.  In no case did the tape show or  instruct in alternate positions -- not exactly for ""all levels of  fitness"".  I also did not find the tape to be easy-to-use.  The verbal  instructions were evidently designed to be more soothing than complete.  Unless I watched the video carefully, I was unable to transition between  positions, even when I knew the position they were heading for, because  they only verbally instructed about 1/3 of the necessary moves to reach the  new position.  Since some of the positions are very difficult to watch the  TV from, I had to get out of position and repeatedly rewind the tape.  This  does not turn out to be a 20-minute tape.  Perhaps if you are an  ""acclaimed yoga teacher"" like Patricia Walden, the tape is  beginner-level, easy, relaxing, de-stressing and short.  For me it was not.  If I were already practicing yoga and physically fit and wanted something  to guide me through a series of moves so I didn't leave one out or make  awkward transitions, then I would consider this a p.m. yoga tape.  Again, I  wouldn't be a beginner either.  On the other hand, the scenery and the  music were everything the cover implied.",958435200,10,2143,4.585106382978723
7793553,5,0945671881,I really love this tape.  It is great for de-stressing at the end of a long day and winding down.,1376524800,,97,3.85
7793554,4,0945671881,"This is not for real beginners. I have been doing yoga for about five months now, and I was sore the next day. But I have a feeling it may become one of my favorites. Soothing music, and Walden's voice, make this a calming yet challenging video. The 20 minute routine is perfect for a busy lifestyle.",1289606400,,300,4.280701754385965
7793555,2,0945671881,"This video is NOT for beginners, it's been 3 days and my neck is still in pain from this video.  It's been about 6 months since I've performed any yoga so I decided to round out my exercise/health by trying this tape.

I am of average weight and fitness, and have taken over 40 hours worth of hatha yoga through nightschool classes over the past 5 years and have never felt any pain during or after the classes. So I already have a pretty good understanding of all the poses within this video as I have done the majority of them before, however, the poses did not feel comfortable/relaxing, in this tape as I felt they were geared towards intermediates or advanced students, not beginners.

My neck muscles are extremely sore and I am just beginning to be able to bend my head forward and look slightly right and left again, but still with some pain 3 days later. I believe the problem lies in the instructor transitioning from pose to pose to quickly, especially since this misleadingly is aimed at beginners. She also did not give any tips, such as has always been done in the instructor-led beginner classes I have taken, such as ""if this pose feels uncomfortable, you could try this modified pose"", etc. I know it is up to me as well to listen to my own body, but because of the transitioning so fast I was focused on ""keeping up"". There needed to be more pauses and slow transitions if this is going to be for ""beginners"".

Had this tape been listed for intermediates or advanced, then I would give it a higher rating, but considering the pain it has caused (the reverse effect of it's goal to relax) I am giving it a low rating. I feel sorry for any people who have done this tape and have had no prior experience, as this tape will likely lead to them feeling they have done something wrong causing pain. The producers/marketers of this tape should take more care in appropriately labeling their products.",1221177600,,1912,4.485632183908046
7793556,5,0945671881,"PM Yoga is an excellent practice for winding down, relaxing, and stretching. It begins with a short focus on breathing, encouraging you to turn your attention inward ""where it's quiet."" The practice moves from a seated to a kneeling position (love the gate pose!) and also includes traditional standing poses such as a warrior and lunges. This is a great end-of-day workout, and at 24 minutes, it's also a nice quick practice to fit in anytime you need to relax. Patricia Walden provides very good voiceover instruction in a tone that is calm and relaxing.  Finally, although this is a very doable program for beginners, all of the Yoga Journal videos assume some basic prior knowledge of the poses (using their Yoga Practice for Beginners video is a good place to start).  Although I now consider myself to be at an intermediate level, I still really enjoy this video and use it often; highly recommended.",1116460800,,906,4.838709677419355
7793557,4,0945671881,"Paricia's tape will serve as a guide for those new to Hatha Yoga as taught in the Iyengar tradition.  It is a video that teaches you to do the Yoga asanas (poses) correctly, keeping your body aligned properly.  It encourages you to reclaim your vitality by correcting postural imperfections brought on by wrong living (computers, television and hours of sitting behind the wheel of  automobiles).  If you follow Patricia's guidance you will not only learn to do the poses correctly but will become more strong and flexible and begin to feel more energetic.  The title, Living Yoga:  P.M. Yoga for Beginners, is really the key to this video.  It is an invitation to make room in your daily life for nurturing the body in a kind and loving way through Hatha Yoga. That inclusion in your life of this ancient self healing art is 'Living Yoga'.  This video is for those that want to be actively involved in improving their mobility, becoming stronger and more forcused.  It asks you to be a partner in your own development.  Those new to Yoga will obtain the most from this video if they do the video in sections, mastering the first part before going on to the next.

7793558,5,0945671881,"Patricia Walden is one of the best yoga instructors. Her
and Rodney Yee do an excellent job of instruction. She is
very detailed.
 I like her P.M. yoga tape the best.",1074902400,,166,4.354838709677419
7793559,4,0945671881,"This is a quick 20-minute yoga workout.  Great for those who have limited time to exercise!  The relaxing music, narration, and beautiful scenery of California's Death Valley will calm your mind.  While the challenging yoga routine will release tension in your muscles.  Patricia Walden's yoga routine mainly consists of lunges and balancing poses focusing on stretching the legs and back muscles.  Other yoga postures include child's pose, dog pose, proud warrior, and forward bends.  The balancing poses are difficult and challenging, and I was struggling to maintain my balance.  But I feel energized and more relaxed after I complete this routine.
My only COMPLAINT with this video is that she does not hold the poses very long for a thorough stretch and the routine seems a bit rushed. In a yoga class, you would normally hold a pose for 2-3 minutes.  However, this video is advertised as a brief yoga workout.  If you want to simulate or replace yoga class with a video, this is NO replacement.  However, it is a great video for people with hectic lives because it is easier to make the time for a 20-minute video versus a 50-minute video.
DISCLAIMER:  After reading a few other reviews, I think there is some confusion about what a ""beginners"" video should entail.  If you are excessively overweight, obese, or have any serious health problems--you should consult your doctor before beginning any new exercise regime.  Even though this tape says for ""beginners"" on the box, your health will determine your ability to complete any fitness program. Please be advised that blocks are recommended if you are not flexible, and this video adequately demonstrates alternative poses with the use of blocks.
Moreover, the routine is challenging and easy to integrate into my daily schedule. After three weeks of practicing this routine, I want to continue exercising after I complete this video. For me, P.M Yoga was the perfect starting-place!!",1024790400,5,1943,5.053291536050157
7793560,3,0945671881,"I bought this tape because I've been very sick with Crohn's Disease for 3-4 years now and haven't had any real physical activity because of it.  I picked this video because it said ""...for Beginners"", and because it said ""Stretch, Relax, Renew"".  All this lead me to believe that this would be very easy and a good way to start getting back in shape.  This video is NOT for anyone that is REALLY out of shape.  It would probably be perfect for the average person (in decent shape) to begin yoga.",996969600,5,495,4.406593406593407
7793561,2,0945671881,"If you are looking for a beginner's yoga tape keep looking.  I got the box set of AM and PM Yoga.  The AM is great but the PM is too hard for beginners.  If you are like me, overweight and have not exercise in years, this tape is not for you.  It would take me years of yoga practice to be able to follow this tape.",991699200,4,315,3.727272727272727
7793562,5,0945671881,"This 20 minute easy-to-do yoga video is excellent for beginners, busy people, couch potatoes, for people who fear to be too old to improve their physical abilities, and for busy moms as well as active children. This video could do wonders for mothers after a hectic day. It could also help kids to calm down--at least for 20 minutes--.  And it could provide some fun time for both, parent and child, if practiced together.
I practice this 20-minute yoga workout every day.  In this video, all elements beautifully intertwine to soothe your body and mind. The music is beautiful! It's soft and completely relaxing. The tender sunrays of the sunset over the quiet sands of the Death Valley give you a deeper sense of peace.  And Patricia Walden's white leotard and her slender body also bring the same sense of calmness.
I find so much enjoyment in this video, that I also practice it in the mornings. After my a.m., p.m. yoga workout, I feel more alert and more focused. Ready for a new day.  I could roar like a lion.  You should try to do it yourself.  It`s easy! Do it right after you wake up. Simply set up your alarm clock 20 or 30 minutes earlier. By the end of the day you will be glad you did it.
This video includes a:  -4 minute centering series to quiet the body and mind.  -13 minute P.M. workout stretches the body.  -3 minute guided relaxation revitalizes the mind.
I highly recommend ""p.m. yoga for beginners"". Best of luck...",982368000,11,1440,4.528957528957529
