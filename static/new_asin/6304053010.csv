7860894,4,6304053010,"If you like Red Dwarf, this tape is enjoyable but not as funny as the actual series.  It consists mostly of out-takes of the cast flubbing their lines.  The host, Kryten, is very funny, though.  For die-hard fans only.",1016496000,,218,4.538461538461538
7860895,5,6304053010,"I got turned on to this show when our local PBS station started showing it, & I've been hooked ever since.  This tape of out-takes is great, & can be watched multiple times without getting old.  If you're a fan  of the show, you'll enjoy this tape.  Also check out the second tape,  ""Smeg Outs"".",945388800,5,295,4.290909090909091
7860896,5,6304053010,"This is the first tape of outtakes but it covers series 4, 5, and 6 while the second one covers the first 3 series. Bizzare.  It's probably just that they realized this one was funnier and they only released the second one  because of the success of this tape.  Note to casual fans:  as you might  not know, season 8 of Red Dwarf premiers in the U.K. on February 18th, so  it'll be coming to PBS stations by mid-April.  Well, I'm excited.",918432000,8,438,4.2682926829268295
7860897,5,6304053010,"If you like Red Dwarf you'll love this tape. Bloopers, Q&A, and the original ending from ""Out Of Time"" Make this a must buy  END",899942400,2,128,4.12
