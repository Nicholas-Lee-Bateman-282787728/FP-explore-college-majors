5057226,4,B0075JSOD4,It's great practice tape if you are just learning and only get to practice with others once a week.  The moves are shown in detail and easy to follow.  Great tape!,1356739200,2,163,4.225806451612903
5057227,5,B0075JSOD4,"I would highly recommend Brooke's DVDs to anyone trying to learn line dancing. I also have volumes 1 & 2 as well and really enjoy her teaching style, she's easy to listen to and follow along with. The lessons are very user friendly and I was able to catch on very quickly to the steps. This DVD has a lot of the line dances that are popular at the bars that do line dancing and 3 dances that are not included on her other DVDs. My husband and I have really enjoyed it.",1355184000,,468,4.043010752688172
5057228,3,B0075JSOD4,"I am enjoying this DVD. She seems to be a good teacher. Somehow, there is something lacking although I can't put my finger on what it is.",1341360000,,137,4.111111111111111
5057229,3,B0075JSOD4,"instruction is not as detailed as other dvd's by different instructors, need some idea of the dance to follow.",1436659200,2,110,4.842105263157895
5057230,5,B0075JSOD4,"This line dance DVD is great. If you want to learn a good variety of dances I think this is a good way to go. I definitely feel like I got my moneys worth. The line dance instruction was good. Me and my kids put this DVD on and we were all dancing and having a blast in the living room and let me tell you my legs can feel it today. So not only do you learn some really cool dances but you get a work out at the same time. This was great for family bonding time and when you go out dancing you will be able to show off your new moves...
I received this DVD for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review.",1432166400,,620,3.7045454545454546

5057235,3,B0075JSOD4,"Learning the footwork is difficult because of the mirror image.  When she turns around, her footwork is easy to follow, but those parts were not marked on the tape so it was hard to easily replay the helpful parts of the lesson.",1396828800,3,228,4.428571428571429

8510601,4,B0075JSOD4,"The DVD is very instructional and Brooke is very clear in her demonstration. There is a mix of easy to intermediate dances. Two factors influenced my rating: 1) Following the initial demonstration the dance step is put to music before others join Brooke to demo the dance. Often the music selected for practicing the steps to music is more difficult than the music used during the large group instruction. From an instructional perspective, the first practice with music really should be easier. 2) Brooke could help the viewer by being more directive (e.g., start with your left leg) during the group instruction.",1494806400,5,614,5.029411764705882
