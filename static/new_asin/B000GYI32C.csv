8135406,1,B000GYI32C,"I remember watching this when I was young. Perhaps my mind at that time was distorted and set on stupid mode, more than I knew. We bought the set and I was barely able to get thru two of the discs. Most of it is close enough to porn I don't understand how they got it on t.v., and the language is so foul. Personlly, save your money and do NOT buy this. It SUCKS!",1240012800,,363,3.8533333333333335
8135407,1,B000GYI32C,"I purchased this product as it clearly stated it was in BD format but when it arrived, they are normal Region 1 DVDs. I paid courier for this so returning is not reasonable so I'm stuck with these.",1194393600,,197,4.2105263157894735
8135408,5,B000GYI32C,"Hear that kiddies. Those are mad dogs barking. People ask me why don't I just shoot them. Well I did shoot them, thats why there so mad. For anyone that has ever caught even one episode and liked it this is a great buy. You could start off and just buy, say one seasons worth, but when that last episode finishes and your yearning to hear the Crypt Keeper roll out just one more Tale... Well, you'll wish you had saved yourself the aching wait and just bought the whole set. I got all five seasons for Christmas and had finished all seventy some odd episodes before New Years rolled around. The stories are all great. Any fan of O'Henry will appreciate these, as they've all got the O'Henry twist at the end. I only wish they'd hurry up with seasons 6 and 7. It's a pity they didn't make more.",1169078400,,793,4.258278145695364

8135410,4,B000GYI32C,"Once every season has been individually released, you just KNOW they are going to re-issue the complete series in a deluxe and very cool package, probably inside a crypt-like box replete with a miniature Cryptkeeper figure. I just know it's coming, and I HATE IT.",1163635200,3,263,4.866666666666666
8135411,5,B000GYI32C,"The Tales From the Crypt series was some of the best television airing back in the final year of the 80s and into the early 90s. Deliberately over the top. Deliberately funny. Deliberately campy at times. Deliberately scary. Deliberately gory. Deliberately one of HBO's finest creations.

The episodes are all based on EC Comics of old...mostly from the self titled Tales From the Crypt and Vault of Horror comic books. But I'd guess that 90% of you reading this already know that, and you're here as I am delighted that it is finally out on DVD.

For those that have not seen these wonderfully entertaining episodes of dark humor and horror...if you're into the genre this collection and any of the other HBO seasonal Tales From the Crypt releases are for you.

Hit the Buy button. These'll kill ya! Or buy each season separately (at the time of this writing it's cheaper to buy 'em separately!).",1155772800,5,897,4.737179487179487
