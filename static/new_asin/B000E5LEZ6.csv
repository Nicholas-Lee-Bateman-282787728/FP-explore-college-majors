8106114,5,B000E5LEZ6,"Hip Hop Laws of Success is very motivating! I've watched it several times. It really gives you a close up view of what it takes to be successful in not only Hip Hop, but in whatever you choose to pursue. For those interested in using Hip Hop to reach and teach youth and young adults I also suggest checking out ""Live Above The Hype: A Hip Hop Life Skills Curriculum."" It includes 20 insightful lessons that initiate in depth self reflection in at risk youth and young adults, with a powerful foreword written by Dr. Michael Eric Dyson! Peace Russell Simmons' Hip Hop Laws of Success. Well done!",1400544000,,595,4.518518518518518
8106115,5,B000E5LEZ6,Got this for one of my grandsons and think he will enjoy it when he sees it.  Thanks for prompt delivery and quality of product being just as you described it!,1367452800,,159,4.129032258064516
8106116,4,B000E5LEZ6,Watched it with my 14 year old. We both thought it was good. I did not know about Simmons'Teen Summits. Sounds like he does alot to try and give back. My son could relate to his interviewees so the movie kept his interest. I also bought his new book Do You! but haven't had the time to read it yet.,1181001600,,298,3.9833333333333334
8106117,3,B000E5LEZ6,"""Hip-Hop Laws of Success"" is worth the buy.  It simply showcases the small things to meditate on for success in hip-hop.  I wouldn't say they are laws though!!  I would definitely recommend the dvd to anyone seeking inspiration into the hip-hop business world.",1149120000,,260,5.0
