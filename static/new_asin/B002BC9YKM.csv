8360998,4,B002BC9YKM,"""Orders to Kill"" is a 1958 black and white British film and shares much in common with ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) - a uniform soldier is transferred to a new unit and trained as a spy to assassinate a suspected double agent, but fears that the killing isn't justified. He commits the killing, becomes a drunkard, later recovers, and eventually seeks out the dead man's family to make amends.

Canada born Paul Massie (1932-2011) stars as an American air force pilot selected to go on a mission to Nazi occupied Paris and assassinate a suspected double agent in the French Resistance. He won the BAFTA as ""most promising newcomer"" for his role in this film. He does a good job showing ther slow transition from a gung-ho enthusiast to a man who must reconcile with his conscience. Despite this beginning, he soon turned to British TV where he remained active with only an occasional film.

Eddie Albert (1906-2005) gives another fine performance as Massie's training officer. Albert was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Roman Holiday"" in 1954 and ""The Heartbreak Kid"" in 1973) as well as a Golden Globe (""Teahouse of the August Moon"" in 1957 and ""The Longest Yard"" in 1974) He's best known for his role in the TV series ""Green Acres"" (1956 - 1971), but my personal favorite is his role as the cowardly captain in ""Attack"" (1956).

Lillian Gish (1893-1993) plays Massie's mother, though she is only in a few scenes at the beginning. Gish was probably the biggest female star of the silent era, appearing in ""The Musketeers of Pig Alley"" (1912), ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915), and ""Intolerance"" (1916). Her talkies include several memorable roles, including Mother Mary in ""Portrait of Jennie"" (1948) and Rachel in ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955). Her TV films include ""Trip to Bountiful"" (1953) and ""Whales of August"" (1987).

The film is directed by Anthony Asquith (1902-68) who is most famous for ""Pygmalion"" (1938), ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (1952) and ""The VIPs"" (1963).

The top grossing films in 1958 were ""South Pacific"", ""Auntie Mame"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""No Time for Sergeants"", and ""Gigi"". The big Oscar winner was ""Gigi"" (Picture, Director). David Niven won for Best Actor (""Separate Tables"") and Susan Hayward won for Best Actress (""I Want to Live""). Other notable releases were ""Vertigo"", ""The Blob"", ""The Fly"", and ""King Creole"".

The film was nominated for 5 BAFTAs and won 3 (Actress, Screenplay, Newcomer). It falls into the class of 1950s anti-war films set in WW 2 like ""The Men"" (1950), ""Stalag 17"" (1952), ""Generation"" (1955), ""Kanal"" (1956""), ""Attack"" (1956), ""Paths of Glory"" (1957), and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). This film, however, concentrates on the espionage side of the war, a topic not normally dealt with from the anti-war POV.

Bottom line - certainly worth a look.",1345248000,,2822,4.90356394129979
8360999,5,B002BC9YKM,"Though this excellent black and white film was made in 1958, it is one of the few movies that tells the psychological truth about wartime killing, namely that it can traumatize the killer.  Set during World War Two, the flim concerns an American Air Force officer recruited to kill a possible Nazi collaborator in Vichy France.  The action in the film takes us from the officer's training to the actual deed to the aftermath--from naive eagerness to personal horror to an alcoholic binge to the recovery of dignity.

It is frankly a disgrace that this film is not available in Region 1 format.  We Americans, who too often glamorize war, should all be lucky enough to see this neglected gem.",1345161600,,691,4.733333333333333
