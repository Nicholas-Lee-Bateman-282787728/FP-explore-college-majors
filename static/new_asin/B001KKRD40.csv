3665815,4,B001KKRD40,"Partner's in crime for many years, it would still seem to be a slightly out of kilter teaming of the ""original jam band guitar hero with Nick the Greek Gravinites"".  It is not. A dream come true for Cipollina fans, [almost nothing available in the way of visual record] this also offers proof of Gravenites strength as a singer, and surprising evidence of his guitar skills, as well as a long, loving look at one of the most original,and sadly overlooked electric guitarists of his, or any time.",1235520000,31,495,4.625
3665816,5,B001KKRD40,"Before I bought this I read all of the reviews. I first looked at the bad review (there was only one)which was very critical. Once I read the worst, I knew I had to have this, and sure enough it is everything you would expect from John. I spent many years during this era seeing John live in many different bands and many different places. This is one of the best you can get on video. There just isn't that much footage out there. It is Cippolina doing what we love him for; having fun just being himself, with Nick giving him the front seat. You will not be let down if you buy this.",1300752000,3,585,4.095652173913043
3665817,5,B001KKRD40,"John Cipollina has some well known recorded evidence - Happy Trails, the live album - of his terrific guitar and tuneful talent. Nick Gravenites, I would say, has been somewhat overlooked; at least until Wolfgang's Vault put out Bloomfield concerts where Gravenites sings; he's got a great voice, check out ""Born in Chicago"". This DVD has some amazing music on it; I was struck right away by ""Bad Luck Baby"" which showcases the subtle driving force of Gravenites, and the blues-laced psychedelic tinged guitar of Cipollina; a fabulous performance. These two are extraordinary blues interpreters, really original. They both rank equal to their fellow musicians like Bloomfield and Butterfield. Not to diss those last two in any way, of course. The other two band members are also excellent.

These Rockpalast DVDs seem to have some pretty rare, but important, performances. I must say that the German fans seem to know hard rock well.",1297468800,3,933,5.098039215686274
3665818,1,B001KKRD40,"Sad to see John still standing like he is some kind of guitar rock God but couldn't even play in tune. Gravenites still plays great, much better than John. I remember John's great sound and guitar work with Quicksilver, he peaked with them and never ever moved farther than his days with Quicksilver, not sure if it was drugs or he was just a one trick pony. His sound later was horrible, don't know what amps he used but he would use the old SG for lap slide, but used a Carvin for his leads, which was never in tune, and the old sound with Quicksilver is gone, the band would have sounded great if John wouldnt have played. I was very sad to see that John was still standing tall and thinking he sounded good. After Quicksilver John just never was able to regain his sound or move forward. When he played Who Do you Love, it was plain sad, and his guitar was so far out of tune the song sounded horrible. Don't bother to buy anything after Quicksilver, John Cipollina is better remembered with Quicksilver Messenger Service, without Gary Duncan, playing with John,and someone to take over when John goes out of tune, is just very sad to see. I will remember John as I do with Quicksilver and know that past that, John never progressed but got lazy and sloppy with his playing.",1293926400,4,1278,4.39662447257384
3665819,4,B001KKRD40,"There are two basic types of music DVD's: documentary style and concert style. This movie is the later and can, therefore, be rightly reviewed for it's music content alone. The only visual warning I will issue is that Nick Gravenites is way less cool looking than you ever would have imagined. I'm sure that the decision to put Cipollina on the cover was a no-brainer...but on to the music.

If you are a fan of this particular group, this concert probably contains the best overall documentation of their sound. The band's 1982 release ""Monkey Medicine"" is plagued by sterile production and fails to capture the grit that makes this band great despite the musically challenged decade in which it was made. This is the reason I give the dvd a 4-star rating. The problem with this live set seems to be that the band was unaware of the strengths it contained. Gravenites has one of the all-time great blues-rock voices ever and is relegated to rhythm guitar on almost half of the tracks. Conversely, Cipollina is perhaps the most exciting guitarist to emerge from the Haight-Ashbury scene of the 1960's, but should never be allowed near a microphone. Why, oh why would he insist on murdering the vocals on ""Who Do You Love"" when a mere 7 steps away Nick Gravenites stands mute?

Despite these musical missteps the band gets the formula right on a few of the songs; most notably ""Bad Luck Baby"" and ""Small Walk-in Box"" (mis-titled ""Small Walking Box"" on the DVD). It is for this handful of exciting moments that I would recommend this DVD to any serious fan of guitar driven blues-rock.",1287187200,8,1583,4.7111913357400725
3665821,5,B001KKRD40,"I bought the DVD.  I am a huge John Cipollina fan and this is, by far, is the best looking and sounding footage I have seen of him.  And I have seen a lot.  Some uber-collector out there may have something better, but, dollar for dollar, you won't find anything better than this.  Sure, there are faults.  Filmed in Germany for the Musikladen TV show there, it shows nice footage of him using his psychedelic Gibson SG that he also used in all of the classic psychdelic venues of the 1960's.  This guitar is American music history.  You can now view it, and his trend setting 1960's amp rig, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.  Gravenites looks in good health and puts on a good performance.  The rhythm section is competent and they are regular sidemen that Gravenites and Cipollina relied upon often during this time period.  There are no song surprises here, so fans will not see anything new or relevatory.  However, the closing number certainly must have taken those Deutchers back to the Avalon Ballroom in 1967, minus the light show and the original QMS lineup.  Cipollina pulls out all of the ""Happy Trails"" stops!!  If you've never seen it, here's your chance.  The first time I saw it was at the old Olympic Dance Hall in Bould-aire, Colorado in 1984.  I was astounded then, myself.  Very cool.  You can see all of his tricks.  The DVD also includes Gravenites-Cipollina Band footage (with Greg Elmore on drums) from the SURVIVORS movie as a cool bonus.  However, the quality of that footage is inferior to the original VHS I own and play occasionally.  I hope to transfer my SURVIVORS video to DVD myself so that I can have a nicely preserved copy.  Nonetheless, it is nice to see the SURVIVORS footage available once again.  And now for my Musikladen wish list: Got any Mike Bloomfield, Nektar, Gong, Tony Williams Lifetime, Muddy Waters, Albert King, Charles Lloyd, Larry Coryell, Deep Purple with Tommy Bolin, et. al., etc., sitting in the can ready to be released?????",1265587200,5,1996,4.659025787965616
3665822,5,B001KKRD40,This is an excellent video and show. I am really glad I picked up this gem. Great and rare footage of Jim Cipollina at his best with a Hot band. What more can I say. Buy it!,1259798400,,173,3.7027027027027026
3665823,5,B001KKRD40,"This DVD release is part of a ""West Coast Legends"" series of video concerts originally broadcast in Germany between 1976-86. This particular concert of the Gravenites-Cipollina band was recorded on November 28, 1980, and it features a lineup of Nick Gravenites (Electric Flag, Big Brother, Mike Bloomfield & Friends) on vocals and guitar, John Cipollina (Quicksilver Messenger Service) on lead guitar and vocals, Al Staehely (Spirit) on bass and vocals, and Marcus David (who bears a physical resemblance to original Quicksilver drummer Greg Elmore)on drums.
  Ironically, the band was widely regarded at the time--either affectionately or derisively--as a 60s dinosaur nostalgia act. Thirty years later, it's apparent that these guys were superb musicians who were playing their hearts out, and this stuff has weathered the years far better than most of the punk and new wave shenanigans of the period.
  Nick Gravenites shines as singer and songwriter, and his guitar playing is also underrated. The concert includes outstanding versions of ""Southside"", ""Junkyard in Malibu"", ""My Party"", and his signature tune, ""Buried Alive in the Blues"". The slithering, sinister blues psychedelia of ""Bad Luck Baby"" features an almost raga-like guitar intro. Staehely pitches in with some fine lead vocals on his own songs, including ""Signs of Life"", ""Trust Me"", and ""Hot Rods and Cool Women"". There is also a smokin' version of the Spencer Davis Group's ""Keep on Running"".
  A good portion of the concert is devoted to revisiting Quicksilver Messenger Service, either on songs associated with the band, or later material that recreates the classic sound of the band. ""Unvicious Circle"", a Cipollina instrumental, revisits the psychedelic Spanish flamenco guitar sound of ""The Fool"" and ""Calvary"". ""Small Walk-In Box"" (here erroneously titled ""Small Walking Box""), a Gravenites instrumental, revisits the jazzy jamming of ""Gold and Silver"". There is a stellar version of ""Pride of Man"", and the frosting on the cake, a ten minuted reading of ""Who Do You Love"", for which Cipollina recreates his original guitar riffs, and even revisits the spacey ""audience response"" segement from the Happy Trails version of the song.
  There is a generous helping of the charismatic Cipollina, looking fabulous, and executing his dramatic stage moves. Also, there are some excellent closeup shots of his fingerpicking and tremolo bar techniques. On some numbers he pulls out his classic ""bat wing"" design Gibson SG from the Quicksilver days!
  The quality of the picture and sound are hampered by the technology of the period, but those shortcoming are more than compensated by the quality of the performance. A must have for fans!",1251417600,20,2705,5.343529411764706

8315069,5,B001KKRD40,"This is a terrific concert from 1980 featuring four excellent musicians who really gelled together, and who genuinely looked like they were having a good time.

Between them, the band members can claim some real rock pedigree, including involvement in bands such as Quicksilver Messenger Service, Electric Flag, Spirit, and others. I have long been a fan of John Cippolina, great lead guitarist, but this concert is most definitely about all four of the band members.

Well worth watching.",1479168000,,489,5.177215189873418
8315070,1,B001KKRD40,"Nick Granites does some nice singing, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this DVD.  Granites' guitar playing is unremarkable, and Cipollina is badly out of tune, making it hard to listen to anything he plays. The songs by the bass player are terrible. Too bad; I like Granites and Cipollina a lot and this is one of the only DVDs of either of them, but it just isn't any good.",1469232000,,394,4.253333333333333
8315071,3,B001KKRD40,"As a Cipollina fan this DVD was disappointing.  As others have stated he struggles with staying in tune throughout and is off his game.  Nevertheless, there are a few good moments and I believe this is the only decent footage of Cipollina out there.  For those interested in his playing technique, this fits the bill.",1451692800,,317,4.7272727272727275

8315074,5,B001KKRD40,"John Cipollina was always my favorite guitarist of the musicians of the West Coast Psychedelic scene of the latter '60s. John had an amazing, unique sound, kind of like a blending of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, and Link Wray, on some really good acid. Although most well-known for his work with Quicksilver Messenger Service, this band - the John Cipollina/Nick Gravenites Band - is quite good, and this DVD of their performance on Nov 28th in Dortmund at the Westfalenhalle is wondrous. Each of the musicians are exemplary separately and as a band.

As there isn't a lot of video recording of John's remarkable playing, if you're a fan this is required viewing. Check out as well ""Recoil: John Cipollina in Music & in Memory"".",1362096000,2,723,4.784
8315075,5,B001KKRD40,"....you left this world way too soon, and so much of your live stage artistry never got preserved for posterity, like magic come and gone......really good to see and hear you performing, Chip, on this excellently done German recording of some of your later blues/rock work with your buddy Nick from the early QMS days.....the voice of your guitar is one of the most distinctive and expressive in the history of rock and roll......may you rest in Peace, and we thank you for all you brought.",1320624000,,490,4.709302325581396
8315076,4,B001KKRD40,"The video quality on this DVD is very good considering the time that it was recorded.  I wish the sound was richer but again this was taken from television so there is no real disappointment here.  This band which would eventually evolve into Thunder and Lightning produced some of John's best playing.  I loved the old Quicksilver stuff ( The Fool, Who Do You Love?, Mona ) but by the late 80's this band would add even more depth to their repetiore.  That said this DVD is the best that I have seen John play on.  I just received a note from Amazon that they will be selling the Terry and The Pirates DVD from the same series.  I bought this DVD from Grooves in Germany a few months back and while it has some very good music and the band is great with both Greg Elmore and Ncky Hopkins for some reason John's guitar is way back in the mix at times.  That said the versions of Cobra and Edward the Mad Shirt Grinder will please John's fans.  I would recommend both of these DVDs",1302048000,,980,4.231182795698925
