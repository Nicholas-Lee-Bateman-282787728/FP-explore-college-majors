7563334,5,B0195VYVOA,"I was planning on giving up on this show but decided I'd give it a try. I had loved the novel and the first season was a weird sort of hybrid from the novel. I didn't dislike it but I didn't love it. However, it kept me watching. I figured they'd do more of the same for season 2. I was wrong. Now that they had done the novel in season 1, they were free to do whatever they wanted in season two. I shortly could see that the novel had been handicapping them. Without the novel, they were forced to write something original for the screen and I must say that they outdid themselves.

The vast majority of characters are back for season two so there are the same actors plus some new ones. The ones which were missing were weak so you don't miss them. What they do in season 2 is move to a town where supposedly no one was ever taken. Everybody in the town was still there while there were disappearances everywhere else. This has made the place the most desirable place on the planet to live. So most of our characters, sooner or later, move there. On the very first episode, Justin Theroux arrives in this other town.

Justin comes into his own in season two. He does a heck of an acting job here. There is one sequence where he is in a strange, hallucinatory type state and he does an exceptional job acting in that episode. He carries that episode almost entirely on his own.

There may or may not be a supernatural aspect to season two. I am not quite sure. Everyone was talking about that on the forums but the whole thing is done so skillfully that you are certain of nothing.

It is rare to see series tv radically improve but in this case the show shot straight up to A+.",1451260800,12,1679,4.204968944099379

7563336,5,B0195VYVOA,This TV series is amazing. The acting is superb. the writing is great and I just enjoyed this excellent second season. It has so many unforgettable moments!

7563337,5,B0195VYVOA,"Justin Theroux is a power house. Love his Acting and Choices as well as liv Tyler of course. Some of the content is a bit graphic, but if one watches the whole season, the circle makes sense. The theme of the show reminds a little bit of some of the attitudes from the 70's, so it is right down my alley. Thanks for all the entertainment, great acting, wardrobe, music and effects. ""Where is my Mind"" by the Picxies is part of the ""Leftover""-Series...need we say more? Bravo!!!

7563349,5,B0195VYVOA,"I can't separate out the seasons. This applies to all three.

My sister recommended The Leftovers to me. After the second or third episode I confessed to her I didn't like any of these people. They acted crazy and I said I didn't know if I cared to see more of their lives. She reminded me they had all been traumatized and their craziness was their response to trauma.

That thought held my interest and slowly I began to get involved in their search to make some sense of what had happened to them. At first I was most puzzled by Laurie because she seemed like she had lost nothing and had one of most extreme reactions. Later her loss is revealed.

I so much liked Nora as she struggled to believe she had come to terms with her loss even as it became more obvious that was not the case. And Kevin who wound up discovering his bizarre gift to enter the world of the dead.

I began to realize that our lives are not that different. We all struggle to make sense of a perplexing world. Many of us  maybe most of us  are traumatized by life at some point. The Guilty Remnant is not that different from Westboro Baptist Church that pickets against homosexuality at military funerals. Noras struggle is not unlike the aftermath some people experience after a family member commits suicide.

To some degree we all feel that we were left in a place that never makes complete sense, that confounds us, disappoints us and leaves us lost. Maybe the only hedge against an uncertain world is companionship and its fragile at best.

I began the last episode with such hope for Kevin and Nora. They had persevered on a cobbled-together faith that did little more than protect them from the chaos that stalked them relentlessly. After going though so much, it seemed their remaining lives would have been so empty apart and alone.

As they each told their stories, tears streamed down my  tears of empathy for their suffering and sorry. When Kevin held out his hard and Nora placed hers in his, I felt at peace.",1502496000,4,1999,4.482093663911845

No questions are ever answered, much of the plot line is a confusing mess, & the finale is beyond anti-climactic. It would have worked much better making it into a 8-10 part miniseries instead of a 3 season show. Really disappointing.

Christopher Ecceslton & Carrie Coon are phenomenal and theirs were the only two characters I could bring myself to care about. But even their stellar acting couldn't save this trainwreck.",1500595200,,571,4.826530612244898

7563358,5,B0195VYVOA,"THE LEFTOVERS reels you in and keeps you hooked from the beginning and in true Damon Lindelof fashion, you'll be more and more intrigued and confused with each fascinating episode.

The world is still adjusting to the mysterious ""departure"" of 140 million people who simply vanished in plain sight on October 14. Kevin Garvey (the remarkable Justin Theroux) moves the remnants of his family to a small town of Jarden, Texas often called ""Miracle""--the only town on earth that did not experience a loss on October 14. There are several new cast members a new ""feel"" and more mystery in Jarden that strictly regulates visitors and residents. There is so much going in Season 2. It's best to let the viewer be surprised but there are some odd things going on in Jarden and with the Garvey family. The Guilty Remnants are still stirring up trouble with formerly quiet and shy Meg (Liv Tyler). Meg is now decidedly evil and unpredictable.

THE LEFTOVERS has a dream cast of amazing actors. Justin Theroux is an amazingly talented actor who can speak volumes just with his eyes and facial expressions. His character Kevin fills his soul and we feel Kevin's pain and confusion. Carrie Coon a Nora Durst, Kevin's new love, shines brightly this season.

Several new cast members also shine this season -  Regina King and Kevin Carroll as the troubled John and Erika Murphy. Their story alone could fill a series. It really deserves to mention that THE LEFTOVERS gives some fantastic actors a chance to show their talents. The Murphys are African American but finally, a show where race is not the theme. The Murphy family are just regular people--well, of course, no one is ""regular"" or ""normal"" in the LEFTOVERS. The Murphys have their own secrets and a new mystery is brewing. King and Carroll are truly remarkable actors.

As with creator Lindelof's series LOST, questions and mysteries are answered by new questions and mysteries. And if a character dies or disappears, you know you will see them again. This series will keep you rivoted.",1498694400,3,2033,4.847262247838617

I was led to believe that when this person tried to send me this, that they were great movies and when he got the wrong type, {Blu Ray} and I went ahead and got DVD's myself, I was really looking forward to seeing them, but boy was I fooled. These video's should have been rated X for pornography, extreme violence and major profanity and blasphemy against Jesus Christ and I wouldn't even give it a rating of one, if I had the choice of rating it at all.

As for the presentation itself, it is superb. The picture quality is beautiful. As is the music, though I hope others have better speakers than I do so that they may fully enjoy the beauty of the soundtrack.

Binge watched Season 1 & 2 for ""FREE"" on HBO/Prime and big thumbs down. I will never get that time back.
Title says it alone ""Leftovers"" the stuff usually given to the dogs or reheated because of being to lazy to make lunch for work.
They must have used all the leftover talent, writers, and etc to make this this dull lifeless show.
Same handful of music played over and over, it was mental torture.
At some points it like a bad music video slapped together by amateurs.
SHAKY CAM for absolutely no reason. In fact shaky cam is the lamest overused effect ever. Please STOP using shaky cam.

I think, above any other show I've seen in recent memory, the essence of what makes good movies and television is captured and distilled in The Leftovers. It is not about the special effects, not about the plot twists (per se, there are still good ones), not about the shock and awe, or about the story even, but about the CHARACTERS, how we relate to them, and how we watch them grow and evolve through their experiences. That sounds really boring at face value, and it's the reason I hesitated before trying this series out, but I am really happy that I did because somehow this show grabs my attention every episode. This show is incredibly interesting philosophically and spiritually, and despite it's lack of overall direction, its message and medium of telling the stories of its characters are powerful.

The story line was there, but it was NOT easy to follow - they jumped around way too much, and the  soundtrack was HORRENDOUS. Whoever chose the music - right down to the opening music - will likely never be hired again. I had to finish, because I committed. But I wish it had been executed like the 1st season.",1466726400,,570,4.588235294117647

7563412,4,B0195VYVOA,"I loved season one so I had very high expectations for season two. Season two did not come close to meeting those expectations. That said, I think it's still worth watching.

7563413,5,B0195VYVOA,"I really cannot find words to express just how moving and brilliant this series is . I am inclined to say it's actually the best TV series I have ever watched and that's because of it's originality, acting and the overall power that it holds over the viewer. I would be the first to admit it will not be to everyone's taste and there are times that it's really hard to watch but I really feel that this will gain classic status .

7563423,1,B0195VYVOA,"In order to have a dream sequence or ""under the influence of drugs"" or insanity sequence work, it has to be the exception.  For series two, this was not the case.  I loved season one for it's clever layers and after-watching-interpretations, but this was just a fail--not for the actors--they gave good performances for a mess.  My post watching question was ""are you kidding me?!!!""",1458518400,5,383,4.861538461538461

7563425,5,B0195VYVOA,"This darkly themed show is not for everyone, i.e. people who want to laugh, walk away feeling good, or understand the whole story. The show takes its sweet time in revealing its mysteries while always adding a few new enigmas. There's a lot of crazy behavior which makes little sense; we wonder ""why did he do that""?, only to receive a partial answer a few episodes later. It's like there's an elaborate web underlying the world and we're only seeing some of the high points but the connections are hidden.
Word is that the show has been renewed by HBO for a third and final season. I hope they reconsider letting a show this good die.",1458000000,7,635,4.482758620689655

7563427,5,B0195VYVOA,"I didn't know if they could match or outdo Season 1 but I just finished watching Season 2 and it was another crazy stunning work of art. Haunting performances all the way around. I don't know if this series will or can continue but if it doesn't continue this season was about redemption for Justin Theroux's character along with Amy's character & reunion. This show is not for everybody and some people will not be able to stomach it or see it as a masterpiece as I do For others, it will certainly take you on a roller coaster ride you the gamut of human behavior and emotion from the capacity for good to the absolute horrifying worst things humans are capable of.

I kept saying to myself why is this family so messed up in Season 1--they didn't lose anyone (other than the pastor's brain damaged wife). Season 2 has clarified how and why they were lost and broken or disconnnected from each other before the event of October 14th.

It also shows the tremendous capacity to hope again and live again and the sometimes very twisted road one must or might travel to be grateful for what they do have and for home. Even when ""home"" is in shambles its who is there or not there that makes it home. At least that is my interpretation.  This is the kind of show you have to think and talk about about long after you stop watching it.",1457827200,3,1331,4.358870967741935
7563428,5,B0195VYVOA,"Season 2 has the same 'What?' twists as the first season. It has the immediate hook because of the story line, the acting, the flash backs and the time it takes to figure out what is happening. We thoroughly enjoyed 1st season and again 2nd season. Where it can be taken from here will be interesting.",1457654400,,301,4.392857142857143
7563429,5,B0195VYVOA,"This show is awesome.  Many don't understand it but I think it is about coping with loss and finding redemption.  We all can do bad things at times and these characters are flawed just like us and this show represents the many different ways people deal with problems, but I feel after watching season 2, it is about humanities need for love and family.
