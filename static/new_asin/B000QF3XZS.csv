8195934,2,B000QF3XZS,"Produced by Andrew Lau, the director of Infernal Affairs, the film that inspired ""The Departed"", takes a shot at the horror genre with former ""exploitation king"" Chin Man-Kei at the helm. ""Haunted School is full of flashy editing tricks, overblown screams that can damage your subwoofer, sound effects, it has an overblown arsenal of stylized flashes and cuts. Chin is trying hard to pump up the HK-horror genre, Haunted School is highly stylish that it may satisfy an audience a bit tired of the slow-paced Asian horror fare.

Synopsis partially derived from the dvd cover:
The story begins when 4 new  male students arrive in an all-girl school(what?!)., their arrival creates excitement in the all-girl student group. Miss Fong(Amanda Lee) disapproves and cites the many stringent rules of the school, including one that forbids students from falling in love (right!). The punishment for breaking the rules is more than detention, the school has a mysteriously tragic history tied to its rules (spelled out in the opening). Basically, when a rule is broken, a supernatural spectre will come after that student responsible, usually resulting in his/hers untimely demise and the appearance of a black person shaped shadow down the hall. I would think that anyone would leave the school right away, but the institution has been operating for 25 years. A bit far-fetched, don't you think?
When students start dying, the rest starts taking the rules more seriously. That the rules run go against the usual youth activities; dating, smoking, generally acting rebellious and stupid - offers up some decent suspense in Haunted School. However, the music-video style with which the film is made usually negates the effect,  its screenplay pretty much telegraphs its scares. The movie felt more like a theatrical trailer or an MTV music video than a movie.

Fast cutting, screen flashes and a LOT of (wannabe)terrifying screams all combine to make up this very tiring/boring teen horror flick. The characters are so flat and one-dimensional that you don't care about them. Their conflicts and issues are routine, and when they start falling in love, one would say ""So what""?. There's a scene wherein Charlie breaks into the girls dormitory to tell Cat (Kelly Fu) that he loves her, the resulting cheesy confession of his feelings borders on nauseating and is very annoying. Then there is the developing romantic chemistry between Hon and ""Yat-man""(Theresa Fu) which is so dumb and boring, and they're actually the best developed in the in the cast.

Well, it's not that bad if one accepts what they're watching. Haunted School is very routine, and occasionally hits some scare well enough that viewers who like this kind of dumb movie may find the proceedings to be passably diverting. There are the occasional freaky images, and the CGI images can be cool and fresh when they aren't being fake or when it's not cheesy and campy. Also, there's always some guilty pleasure in watching teen idols get killed one by one.

PICTURE: Anamorphic widescreen. The transfer is very nice. Colors are alive, with the  sharpness and detail just right. Some enhancements are visible but not that distracting.
AUDIO/Subtitles: Cantonese language track in 5.1 Dolby and DTS. Subs are in English and Chinese.
FEATURES: I didn't bother.
IN CLOSING: Those who watch Haunted School with low expectations and only want to see eye-candy teen idols will not be disappointed. The ability to appreciate and/or enjoy bad movies is definitely required to tolerate this film. Either that, or you must be die-hard fans by one or all the teen idols that you would watch any movie they're in.
I usually won't bother writing a review for a film I find so lacking, but I wish to spare people the torture. Thank goodness I only borrowed the import Hong Kong release...
