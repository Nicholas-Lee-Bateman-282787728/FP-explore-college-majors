1339433,4,B00004CX40,"Play Dirty is an excellent WWII movie set in Africa that is in the mold of Tobruk and The Rat Patrol.  British Colonel Masters is head of a less than elite group of commandos who has come under the wrath of his superiors.  With one last chance to save his skin, Masters organizes a raid deep behind German lines to blow up a crucial German fuel depot.  But part of the agreement of the mission is that a British officer or engineer with some knowledge on the subject lead Masters' commandos.  Cue Captain Douglas, who immediately clashes with his second in command, Capt. Cyril Leech.  Along with six convict-commandos (think Dirty Dozen), Douglas and Leech set across the African desert to blow up the fuel depot.  They go up against murdering gypsies, horrific conditions, patrolling Germans, each other, and even their commanders back at headquarters.  The movie builds slowly, but still entertaining, to a climax that has to be one of the biggest surprise/shocks ever made.  You won't be disappointed.  As well, plenty of tense, exciting action scenes, beautiful cinematography, and that fantastic ending make for a great WWII adventure.

  In a subdued but still very strong performance, Michael Caine plays Capt. Douglas, the unwilling leader of the group of convict commandos trying to blow up the crucial German fuel depot.  He clashes with Capt. Cyril Leech(a great part for Nigel Davenport) the possible double agent who may be working for the Germans as well.  The tension over command and strategy between Caine and Davenport drives the movie's plot and is what makes the movie all hold together.  Nigel Green, Harry Andrews and Patrick Jordan are good in small parts as the different level of commanders who have control over the mission.  Green is especially good as Col. Masters.  The rest of the convict-commandos, who don't have much to do in the way of lines, include Aly Ben Ayed as Sadok, Enrique Avila as Kafkarides, Mohsen Ben Abdallah and Mohammed Kouka as Hassan and Assine, the two homosexual desert guides, Takis Emmanuel as Kostos Manou, and Scott Miller as Boudesh. The special features, if there are any, for the upcoming dvd release, April 27th, haven't been released, but I'd be happy to just get widescreen presentation and a trailer.  Of course, I'd love to see some interviews with Caine, but that's probably wishful thinking.  So for a relatively little known WWII action movie with great performances from Caine and Davenport along with one of the best shocker endings ever, check out Play Dirty!",1171238400,55,2532,4.943262411347518

1339457,3,B00004CX40,"Play Dirty, (1968), 117 minutes.  In this African-set British World War II picture, Army Captain Douglas, (Michael Caine), a former British Petroleum executive but an inexperienced soldier, is given the task of leading a band of dangerous mercenaries into the African desert to destroy German fuel reserves. Douglas must contend with the cantankerous veteran Colonel Masters, (Nigel Green); an argumentative ex-convict, Captain Cyril Leech, (Nigel Davenport); and the traitorous Brigadier Blore (Harry Andrews).  The classic action-packed war drama was written by Melvyn Bragg and Lotte Colin, and directed by Andr De Toth.  It was produced by Harry Saltzman.

The picture might well be described as ""the dirty dozen meets the storied British stiff upper lip."" It is evidently a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dirty-Dozen/dp/B002M809JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dirty Dozen</a>&nbsp;influenced film: Both movies' story-lines involve convicts going on a deadly World War II mission. And the entertainment even uses the word ""Dirty"" in its title. Furthermore, interestingly enough, Edward Scaife, the cinematographer on this movie, the action sequences of which were filmed in Spain, was also the D.O.P. on THE DIRTY DOZEN.  Oddly enough, the score was provided by the French musical master Michel Legrand.

Caine plays nicely with the cast, which certainly features the usual suspects come to making a war/spy/action/adventure movie.

However, the film is puzzlingly nihilistic for a British World War II picture.  The sour outlook might just be attributed to the massively unpopular Vietnam war then in progress.  Or laid at the door of producer Saltzman.  He famously co-produced the James Bond spy films with Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli, of whom their first and, to me, still greatest star, Sir Sean Connery, so famously said he ""wouldn't p--- in his [Broccoli's] ear if his brain was on fire.""  Caine, of course, is reputed to be a great and good, sometimes co-starring friend, (see The Man Who Would Be King), of Connery's.

Most of the film's acting is satisfactory. The photography is fine. However, Caine, who is an Oscar winner for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cider-House-Rules/dp/B00BB8Q1RQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cider House Rules</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-and-Her-Sisters/dp/B00005O06J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah and Her Sisters</a>, and the BATMAN films, gives too flat a performance.

1339460,4,B00004CX40,"I love history and movies that follow detail actions that defined the hardships of WWII veterans. Play Dirty lives up to all that. Michael Caine is the reluctant hero thrust into commanding an odd group of commandos on a mission to destroy a fuel depot deep behind German lines. Nigel Davenport is superb as the criminal anti-hero and the tense relationship between him and Caine keep you interested. This movie describes the hardships of desert warfare in true form. It is vast, dangerous, edge-of-your-seat action that won't leave you disappointed.

1339481,3,B00004CX40,"I came to this film for two reasons. One is that I love desert war and adventure stories like Lawrence of Arabia, Ice Cold in Alex, Sea of Sand, The Desert Rats, the Italian film on El Alamein,  The Flight of the Phoenix and the Rat Patrol TV series. Secondly I saw that it was produced by Harry Saltzman. I knew Saltzman from the epic film ""The Battle of Britain"" which is the finest airplane movie ever made.
Saltzman is a wizard at using technology to make a film visually exciting, but ""Battle of Britain"" had the drawback of not really showing how the battle affected those involved, except in a superficial way. I wondered whether ""Play Dirty"" would end up the same way.
The film gets off to a good start with Capt Leech driving through the desert dressed as a German officer with his radio blasting ""Lili Marlene"" which became sort of the theme song of the desert war for the Germans. Suddenly, we see him approach British lines, he changes his hat to a British one and he changes the radio to a station playing American jazz. Already, we don't know who we are really seeing. After this interesting beginning the story begins to go downhill.  Frankly, the whole premise of the film doesn't make sense. Capt Douglas, played by the diffident Michael Caine, is an emotionless person who is chosen to lead the next commando attack even though it is unclear what his qualifications are. We are told he is a BP technician who is made into an officer in charge of unloading oil. However, when he is asked if he knows the desert he says ""yes"". How is this connected with his petroleum background? But even if he knows the desert, how is qualified to lead a commando unit? We are not told.
He is then introduced to Capt Leech and his gang of criminal commandos.  The obvious question is how is Capt Douglas going to earn the respect of his men and how is he going to get them to follow his orders? Unfortunately, we are never shown this. The men in his unit, in spite of their ""interesting"" backgrounds, are really nothing more than ciphers in the story.  Douglas proves to them he is intelligent when he is able to get two of his vehicles up the steep hill, but this is a far cry from knowing how to carry out an attack on a fortified enemy position and the need to gain the respect of his men in order to be able to motivate them to endanger their lives on their mission.
It is true that Capt Leech tells Douglas at the beginning that ""war is a criminal enterprise and he fights it with criminals"" but in real life, I don't see how anyone like Douglas would even agree to lead such a group on a dangerous mission. Finally, Michael Caine's completely passive and emotionless acting eventually seems silly in such a scenario.  I believe the film's supposed ""anti-war message"" actually gets submerged in the general nihilistic message of the film in which nothing really makes any sense at all. Even ""patriotic films"" show that war is horrible, so I don't see how this one makes any real contribution to educating society about the true nature of warfare because in spite of its horrors, sometimes wars do have to be fought and not all the officers are cynical people indifferent to the lives of the men under them.
Having said all this, the desert vistas were beautiful, as I had anticipated, there are some exciting scenes, although the attempted rape scene could have been left out.  I would not rate the film as a complete waste of time, but don't get your hopes up too much.",1311206400,,3476,4.474763406940063
1339482,4,B00004CX40,"Play Dirty (1969) is set in the North African desert during World War II, and follows an ill-fated mission by the British Army.  Directed by Andre De Toth (House Of Wax), this is a harsh, unglamorous, straight ahead war adventure that once set in motion, moves along nicely, taking you on a dusty trek through the desert.

The high command of the British Army has learned of the existence of a fuel depot, deep behind enemy lines.  A small unit, led by Captain Douglas (Michael Cain) and Captain Leech (Nigel Davenport) are given the task of crossing the desert following a circuitous route, and then destroying the depot.  Rather than regular soldiers, the group consists of criminals of various types.  Posing as members of the Italian army, the party of three vehicles heads out into the desert.  Douglas is an employee of British Petroleum, commissioned into the army, and is determined to do what is necessary to complete the mission.  With a lack of practical experience, Leech questions Douglas' ability to lead.

The high command actual intended that Douglas' group be a decoy, and sends a second group consisting of regular army personnel trailing behind.  Unfortunately the second group is surprised and wiped out by the German army, leaving Douglas' unit as the only hope.  Braving the elements, the group struggles on through the desert, falling behind schedule.  As they near their objective, they commandeer an army ambulance, which contains a very feisty German nurse.

Under the cover of a sandstorm, the group cuts through barbed wire and enters the fuel depot, where a surprise awaits them.  Now looking for a way to escape, the unit mobilizes for one last desperate mission.  Unfortunately luck is not with them, as the seemingly snake bit operation comes to a close, having been given a very raw deal.  Low key, and with a very British sense of irony, this is a war where those in command have no reservations about sacrificing lives for the `greater good', and then laughing about it.  The plot is mostly plausible, and the action scenes realistic and well- executed.  Spectacular it is not, but Play Dirty is a grunt level, downbeat war adventure that is definitely worth a look, as Caine and Davenport deliver solid performances, and have great chemistry together.  Comparisons to The Dirty Dozen (1967) are not really appropriate, as the situations are quite different, and Douglas' team of convicts fights bravely without being coerced.  A commentary track with Michael Cain would have been fabulous, but sadly the DVD contains no extras at all.",1309046400,,2570,4.962616822429907

1339487,3,B00004CX40,"This is a good movie, though it does not have the magic it held when I first saw it as a kid.

PLAY DIRTY was another film I missed seeing on the wide screen in a cinema.  It was not until years later that I saw the ""edited for television"" version on a TV network's movie of the week.  Remember back then there were only three networks:  CBS, NBC and ABC.  At the time I was just getting interested in military history with my primary inspiration coming from war movies.  PLAY DIRTY was essentially a grittier version of television's RAT PATROL.  Back in the early 1970s I would have ranked this movie as one of the best war films ever made. It might also be that my parents bought their first color television about that time and PLAY DIRTY was one of the first televised movies I was able to watch in color.

The story:  A small group of ad hoc commandoes is dispatched behind enemy lines to destroy a remote German fuel dump.  The group is led by two officers Captain Douglas (Michael Caine) and Captain Leech (Nigel Davenport).  Unbeknownst to our heroes they are considered expendable rejects by their superiors and have been sent out on their mission as decoys.  The actual raiding force subsequently sets off into the Qattara Depression with a considerably beefed up force.  Unfortunately the main force blunders into a deadly German ambush while the ""decoys"" watch undiscovered from the safety of a nearby escarpment.

The desert force penetrates fuel depot only to find that it is a dummy installation.  In pursuit of the real depot they make their way into a Libyan coastal town where they are betrayed to the Germans by their own superiors.  As the British Eighth Army is now pursuing the Germans into Libya, and thus in desperate need of captured fuel, the original mission is scrubbed.  Failing to contact the commandoes the British leak their mission to the Germans.

Michael Caine plays the part of Captain Douglas, a British officer on loan from British Petroleum, whose primary mission was to oversee the unloading fuel in Egypt.  As his position is deemed superfluous he is assigned to the decoy team to satisfy the requirement to have a British officer along.  Nigel Davenport is Captain Leech, a hardened and battle wise veteran who spends most of his time behind enemy lines attired in various enemy uniforms.  Unfortunately his most recent failed raids, as well as his stint in jail, likewise deem him as expendable.

A majority of the film focuses on the conflict and competition between the two officers with Douglas being the more academic problem solving officer and Leech as the experienced desert raider.  As you might expect they eventually develop professional respect for one another.

PLAY DIRTY has not held up well over the years.  The movie is punched full of musical cues beginning with the theme music, Lili Marlene, in German.  Later scenes are accompanied by Italian and other German music blasting from the team's portable radio.  Out of place music worked in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and KELLY'S HEROES, but is a distraction in PLAY DIRTY.  There are also an excess of zoom in and zoom out shots.  Again, this technique was very common in films of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

There is also a very lengthy sequence of vehicles being winched up the steep escarpment.  It is one of those scenes where you have already gotten the point when the first vehicle reaches the top and it is not necessary to spend as much time with the remaining jeep and truck.  The combat scenes are limited to two major engagements.  The first is the ambush of the main British raiding force and the second are the pyrotechnics during the destruction of the fuel depot.

On the other hand there is a good segment involving the team crossing rocky terrain.  So rocky that they find themselves short of spare tires to replace those damaged by the rough ground.  This sequence is worthy of some of the stories written about the Long Range Desert Group.

In many respects PLAY DIRTY looks like it could have been a television movie.  The plot is one typical of 1960s and early 1970s commando-type fare where a select group sneaks behind enemy lines, plan goes awry, yet the target is successfully destroyed anyway.  The story gets a bit confusing with the team switching back and forth between Italian and German uniforms.  At one point we see the team armed with Spanish Z-45 submachine guns, a postwar Spanish copy of the German MP-40, and later carrying German MP-40 Schmeissers.

PLAY DIRTY was one of several films devoted to special operations teams aimed at destroying the Afrika Korps' fuel supplies.  The original, of course, was the 1943 Billy Wilder film FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO.  A year prior to PLAY DIRTY there was a similar storyline in TOBRUK where a long range patrol sets out to destroy Rommel's heavily guarded fuel.  In 1971 there would be a remake, of sorts, of TOBRUK with borrowed footage to create RAID ON ROMMEL.  If you take time to think about it the portrayal of war in North Africa is almost always tied to fuel or water.

PLAY DIRTY was primarily lensed in Almeria, Spain.  Almeria was a common location for movie making involving desert venues.  LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, PATTON, and numerous other films have used southeastern Spain to portray various desert locations.  Without looking too hard you will recognize some familiar first season RAT PATROL film locations.

The widescreen DVD copy of the movie is very good quality.  Indeed the DVD was the first time I ever saw the complete film.  I was somewhat disappointed in that there were no special features - not even an original movie trailer.  So be it.  I encountered the same malady when I finally got around to buying a DVD version of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.  The price was right and the DVD finally replaces my tired old 1980s heavily edited VHS copy.",1241395200,6,5859,4.724852071005917
1339488,3,B00004CX40,"Quite in the same line as the Dirty Dozen and Kelly's Heroes I was surprised never to have heard about this film and seeing that it had great reviews I bought a copy.

The movie is entertaining but no masterpiece. The plot is very 1968'ish, with total disregard of actual facts, well except for the Germans vs. Britain bit. In many ways it is a remake of Sea of Sand (which remains the superior movie). We have a long range desert group sent to blow up Rommel's fuel dump. Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport more or less dominate the film and both are good in their roles although you sometimes get the feel of a Spagetti Western in the set up, the dialoge and how everyone is trying to screw everyone else up (hench the title). All in all it is entertaining and gritty at times but I don't find myself compelled to watch it again.

As to history the LRDG (Long Range Desert Group) was composed of very spirited volunteers, the original being mostly New Zealanders and certainly not convicts or disposables. In this field the movie shows total disregard and takes an open and wide artistic license. The Dirty Dozen (made in 1967) was closer to its mark but both movies were made when War movies were mostly fictional stories set in World War 2 and not as today when real life stories are prefered and in my opinion real life beats fiction hands down in every way.

So in the end I am not surprised that I only first heard of this movie a few months ago, while being a decent movie and entertaining to watch it fades in comparison with many of its counterparts and for a good reason.",1224806400,9,1581,4.389078498293515

The whole picture is informed with a brutal, anti-heroic take on ""The Good War"" that goes beyond mere hip 60s cynicism.

There are a couple of great set pieces, one's a tense minefield in an oasis and earlier there's a drawn out sequence of hauling trucks up a rocky clift that's like Wages of Fear in the desert and it's sensational.  (There's also the inclusion of the gay Middle Eastern members of the team that is shown without a trace of comedy or sterotyping.)

Also, note the image of the scorpion being taunted in the ring of fire that would essentially be swiped by Peckinpah for the next year's Wild Bunch.",1208649600,7,877,4.7368421052631575

The plot's pretty unimaginative, with the greatest disappointment being the ending, but considering it the anti-war era when the film was made, not unexpected. You'll wince when you see a character attempting to return to Allied lines wearing a German officer's uniform, which is incredibly stupid, considering that, with the simple expedient of removing the jacket, the German army desert uniform of this period looks substantially like the Allied uniform. No eye-candy in the way of period aircraft or vehicles, so I can't even recommend it for that reason. Skip this one, or don't say you weren't warned.",1208563200,9,806,5.067669172932331
1339498,5,B00004CX40,"This was always one of my favorites when I was a boy in the 1960s.  PLAY DIRTY had the anti-hero grittiness that is so much more realistic--as I found out during my own military service--than the highly stylized war films that came out just after (and glorifying) WWII.  There are notable exceptions, of course, that show combat pressure and human faults for what they are: Halls of Montezuma, featuring the late, great Richard Widmark as a stress-crippled Marine officer; Decision Before Dawn, with Oscar Werner and Richard Basehart...and various excellent so-called ""B"" movies that are really ""A""s in in my book such as Hell Is For Heroes and Pork Chop Hill.  PLAY DIRTY is a real man show, with cold and hard heroes who aren't really all that likeable, but are essentially human.  It's much like Tobruk with Rock Hudson, and the [...] Raid On Rommel with Richard Burton (going thru the motions skillfully for the money), but with a much more sophisticated subtext of antagonism and tension between the main characters.  Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport are superb.  This is guy-oriented war storytelling at its dark, tough-guy best.  The shocking and very sudden ending is right in line with the nihilistic--and all too realistic--Vietnam-era ethos of which this film is a part.",1207872000,22,1282,4.990610328638498

I would like to emphasize that Play Dirty, in my opinion, is one of the more accurate portrayals of the North African theater of operations in World War 2.  I have been hooked on this movie for almost 30 years! I watch it probably 6-8 times a year and never tire of it!  Michael Caine is fabulous as Captain Douglas.  It is rewarding to watch as Captain Douglas learns the ropes, gains confidence and ultimately, some respect from his group.  I like the ironic plot twist that has Captain Douglas group succeed when the High Command suddenly does not want them to!

1339501,5,B00004CX40,"I first came to love this movie as a child, watching it late at night, cropped and in black and white, on an old Zenith.  I was curious to see it after 30 years, and finally resorted to getting an import copy from Japan a few months before this re-release.  I'm happy to say the movie holds up wonderfully, and seeing it in the proper aspect ratio is real pleasure.

This has to be one of the most cynical war movies ever made, and those who devalue this movie as a knock-off of The Dirty Dozen overlook the way that movie still romanticizes heroism while Play Dirty will have none of it.  From the opening scene of Play Dirty, where an officer's corpse is returned likely shot by the man returning it, there's no sentimentality here, no acts of stunning bravery, just a bunch of schmoes who don't even much like one another trying to stay alive.  This movie presents war as a sort of lazy grand incompetence that occasionally awakens to explosion, warfare, murder, and rape.  While the supporting cast of outlaws seem very B-movie (like those guys who talk in dub in a Sergio Leone western), Caine and Davenport more than make up for it.  The desert photography and scenery is outstanding -- not Lawrence of Arabia pretty but rather the third enemy that threatens to sandblast them right off the screen throughout the film.  Some find desert scenes slow; I find them the mesmerizing.  And Play Dirty remains my favorite war film of all time.  It's the only war movie I know that never lies even once.",1198195200,16,1501,4.525925925925926

Players make good decisions, bad decisons, testosterone based decisions, prejudiced decisions, and gain some nobility and affability as they survive the challenges of a botched suicide mission. Rival intelligence officers set competing missions loose to destroy a german fuel dump in the North African desert during WWII. One group, ""Dirtier than the Dirty Dozen"", nominally led by Michael Caine, sets off behind german lines with bare minimum equipment, while the other fully manned and well equipped follows close behind. With treachery, openly hostile groups and intra group conflict threatening the mission and michael caine every step of the way, they hit a ""noir"" spot in the mission, take a ""noir"" turn then a short jog to the ""noir"" ending. if you like film noir and war movies you'll like this one.",1184803200,11,910,5.114093959731544

The story begins in a desert. A jeep speeds along while the song Lili Marlene plays. [This was popular on both sides.] The driver switches caps and radio stations when he approaches the Allied lines. What happened to the others? Bad luck. Masters explored behind enemy lines, but at a high cost. Sabotaging enemy fuel depots will halt Rommel. The British General has a plan. A Lieutenant knows about petroleum; he will lead a group. Masters introduces his crew; taken from jails. They leave in the morning. They are warned about German patrols. Roads were mined, the map doesnt show it all. The second patrol leaves afterwards. They fill their water cans at the oasis. But one Arab sees a British identity tag on the Lieutenant; they are silenced. Can their automobiles climb up a cliff? The Lieutenant has a plan to do this; it works. The last truck is loaded, the cable snaps! Salvage what you can. The following patrol finds the bodies and buries them.

They see a German patrol down below; it finds the wrecked truck. Will the second patrol run into an ambush? They are wiped out. Captain Leach plays it safe. Bury them! Their supplies are recovered. A jeep is bogged down in soft sand and pulled out. The wind picks up. They continue on their journey. A tire needs changing. Then another. No more spares. There is a booby-trap! It is disarmed. But another is unlucky. They requisition a German ambulance. It has a nurse to treat Hassan. But she is attacked! They approach the German fuel depot. Their trucks are covered due to the sandstorm. The men approach on foot hidden by the sand storm. They pass through a mine field and reach barbed wire; they crawl through. Empty barrels are blown along the sand. The wind uncovers the decoy fuel depot! They must find the real fuel depot and destroy it.

The general has a way to kill their operation since Montgomerys breakthrough means they want to capture the fuel depot and not destroy it. Their radio transmission is monitored by the enemy to locate their position (goniometry). There is another barbed wire fence to pass through. A sentry patrols in the night; he hears something. A trip wire sets off a warning flare! They are asked to surrender! They fire at the sentry posts, then set off the charges to destroy the fuel depot. Mission accomplished. But there are casualties. The two British officers hide in a goat pen. British tanks arrive. The two officers carry a white flag. Dont do it again! [Maybe they should have removed their uniforms before surrendering?]

This was filmed on location in Spain and at Shepperton Studios in England. This is based on the original story by George Marton. It is a slow moving story with a cynical ending. But it does give you an idea of desert warfare for a commando operation. Rommel was successful because of an intelligence source in Cairo. Once this was silenced his luck changed. Intelligence is a force multiplier as it allows an army to concentrate where the enemy is weaker. Montgomery also changed the tactics of the British Army. The success of the movie The Dirty Dozen must have inspired this story.",1451433600,,3133,4.711678832116788
