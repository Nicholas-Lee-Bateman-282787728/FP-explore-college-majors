2451521,5,B000C1VAY2,I'm so glad I found it on amazon one of my favorite dorky animes ever as soon as it came in I watched it all looks way better than the first time I watched it,1356393600,,158,3.5428571428571427
2451522,5,B000C1VAY2,This anime was pretty good. I'd give it five stars and two thumbs WAY up! You can check it out on youtube. It's almost identical to Sailor Moon. Mostly because the Person who made Sailor Moon made Wedding Peach too.,1307923200,,215,4.4
2451523,5,B000C1VAY2,Wedding Peach is a very cute series and this is a wonderful slimline-case DVD box set for fans looking to collect it :),1297814400,,119,4.217391304347826
2451524,5,B000C1VAY2,loved this box set. my little girl really loves wedding peach. its kinda reminds me of sailor moon with how they change into there heroine costumes. the story line is really good and keeps you watching so you doin't get bored. the only thing that grated on my nerves was how wedding peach kept haveing memories wiped. expecally the guy she likes. i will say that wedding peach was worth the money i spent.,1285545600,,405,4.486486486486487
2451525,5,B000C1VAY2,"This is a great anime for anyone who likes Sailor Moon. Some definate similarities with the outfits and attacks, but the plot is all its own. Very funny and addictive. I can't wait to see Season 2! The costume changes are annoying after awhile, just because there are so many all at once. I just fast forwarded through that when it started to annoy me though! :) Well worth the money I paid for it!!!!",1184025600,,401,4.36
2451526,5,B000C1VAY2,"A huge fan of Sailor Moon, This show took me back to the good old days of junior high school girls in ridiculous outfits kicking butt with cutsey attacks.  I prefer to think of it as ""Sailor Moon lite"".

I'm more a fan of the second season then the first, but season one does have its moments.  My favorite devil will always be the first, Lord Pluie.

I must admit, the excessive dress changes (from school uniform/civilian clothes to wedding dresses to skimpy fighting outfits) did get on my nerves, as did the girls tendency to get the attention of the bad guy first AND THEN change into their alter egos.  Good thing they always win, or they would have had problems.

Maybe my problems stem from the fact that I am no longer in the target age group.  No matter, all in all, this is a very cute show that I enjoy.  Not for the very young due to some scenes, more appropriate for the pre-/early teen group.",1180569600,3,907,4.325443786982248

8095102,5,B000C1VAY2,"If you love romance with a dash of comedy, magical transformations, and a bond of friendship that knows no bounds, then give this a try sorta like sailor moon",1502496000,,158,4.482758620689655
8095103,5,B000C1VAY2,This was a great first season of Wedding Peach and way better than what you could expect and I want to find the final season!,1494374400,,125,4.04
8095104,3,B000C1VAY2,"I've long been a fan of, what's known in Japan as, the ""magical girl"" genre. Shows like Tokyo Mew Mew, Shugo Chara, and most infamously, Sailor Moon, have always entertained me with their stories of young girls who transform into superheroines and fight monsters and other villains while trying to balance family, school, and dating. While browsing around the web in search of a new show to watch, this early 90s anime was suggested to me, and considering some of the same animators behind Sailor Moon were also involved in the production, I eagerly dove in.

51 episodes later, and I'm left just kind of shrugging my shoulders. It's a perfectly decent series, but also doesn't offer anything really different or ground breaking.

Momoko and her friends Yuri and Hinagiku, are members of the newspaper club where they mostly cover the school's soccer team and all have a crush on the star player Yanagiba. On their way home from school one day, they are attacked by a demon named Pluie, who is a servant to the high ruler of the devil world, Reine Devila. It is then that Momoko discovers that she's actually a Love Angel--a warrior from the angel world. Transforming into Wedding Peach, Momoko then embarks on a mission to recover the Saint Something Four--a group of powerful objects that can defeat Reine Devila and save the angel world. With the help of her two friends (who turn out to be Love Angels Lily and Daisy), a beautiful angel named Limone, the cold and mysterious Angel Salvia, a reformed devil, Jama-P, and her on again/off again boyfriend, Yousuke, Momoko must gather all her courage and strength to bring peace to both the angel and devil worlds....and also discover what true love really is.

Starting with the good, the animation is well done, and this is par for the course, considering the Sailor Moon team worked on this series as well. Although the characters can fall into certain archetypes (the bookish one, the tomboy, the bad boy, etc.), they're all decent and likeable (save for Angel Salvia, who gets the bare minimum of development and can be downright unbearable at times with her ""lone wolf"", stubborn attitude).  And even though I'm only familiar with the English dub of this series, the voice acting is good as well.  Everyone sounds the right age, and they all speak with great emotional range.

But there's also no getting around the fact that this series, by many turns, copies A LOT off of Sailor Moon.  The fetch quest with the Saint Something Four (modeled after the classic wedding poem ""something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue""), and the Romeo/Juliet twist near the end was an interesting addition....but other than that, everything else is a redux of things we've seen in the other aforementioned anime. Momoko isn't unlike the clutzy and hyperactive Usagi, Reine Devila could practially be Queen Beryl's sister, Jama-P is the cute and loveable mascot ala Luna the cat, and the way Limone is constantly showing up to help save the girls from trouble, he might as well be a long, blonde haired Tuxedo Mask.

And though the plot itself is decent, you can pretty much guess every twist and turn, especially if you're familiar with the magical girl genre, and admittedly, the pacing of the overall story arc is a bit uneven. For every 3 or 4 episodes of info dumps, we get 10 or so episodes of padding and filler in between; leading up to a finale that wraps up just a bit too quickly and neatly.

So, while I enjoyed the ride, this is also a series I'll most likely won't watch again. If you're into the magical girl genre, then you'll most likely enjoy this. Just don't expect anything earth shattering.",1482883200,,3675,4.765723270440252
