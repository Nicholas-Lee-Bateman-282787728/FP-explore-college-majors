5944840,1,B00EUSI5AA,"wow! American corporations just don't get it do they? instead of a big empty box, in the UK you can get the 3 films in ONE compact steel book;
In the USA its style over substance",1448582400,16,178,3.9722222222222223
5944841,1,B00EUSI5AA,"This is almost a fraud.  Look at the listing and just TELL me where it says it contains only one movie.  Yet that is what it contains.  It is the first movie decorated with pounds of fluff.  Going back in the morning.  ""Misleading"" isn't the word ==== there are a whole lot of other words that come to mind.  And I get to pay for the privilege of sending this back.",1448409600,51,365,4.070422535211268

5944844,5,B00EUSI5AA,I recommend the seller and the product! :),1439424000,4,42,4.375
5944845,2,B00EUSI5AA,"This is very misleading,  it's just a huge empty box with one of the 3 movies.  The 4 disks are the same movie, the hunger games,  2 copies, one dvd one blueray,  and two special features disks in the same format. I honestly thought it included the mocking Jay  and catching fire. I was disappointed.  But the collectable item is cute i guess.",1433894400,108,343,4.365079365079365

8609623,1,B00EUSI5AA,"I'm completely disgusted with both the seller and myself.  If only I had read these reviews!!!!  Like so many other reviewers I read through the description and details and although it was a bit vague I couldn't imagine a 4 disc set would not be the 4 movies.  In fact it is a 4 disc set collectable for the first movie only.  I feel, like others, that the description is deliberately deceptive.  I hope others will read these reviews before buying.  I had to unwrap it and open the box to determine what I actually got so I cannot return it.",1472774400,6,542,4.316831683168317
8609624,1,B00EUSI5AA,"I regard this as a rip-off. It is an example of deceptive advertising.
I didn't realize that it was necessary to read the small print when buying DVDs.
It's one of a few times that I haven't read the reviews--Big mistake.",1472256000,4,221,4.414634146341464

8609627,1,B00EUSI5AA,"I am very disappointed in this order.  I bought this as a birthday gift thinking it was the first two movies of the series.  My granddaughter was so looking forward to a movie night with the set.  And to make things worse, one of the movie discs doesn't even work! So I am stuck with a pretty cover on a disc that does not work at all and a nice box. How discouraging.",1459728000,16,368,4.013698630136986
8609628,5,B00EUSI5AA,"Attractive box, well done edition. Why didn't best buy release the other movies to fit in the box?? Thats why it is large and empty, the accommodate the future releases.",1456531200,2,169,4.666666666666667
8609629,3,B00EUSI5AA,There's a whole lot of box and a single movie. I thought I was buying the set. The description may have said and I could have missed it. I was a little disappointed but it's not that big of a deal.,1453161600,3,197,3.8292682926829267
