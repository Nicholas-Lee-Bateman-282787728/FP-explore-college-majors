937874,5,6304911599,"As the other reviews here attest, this is a tremendously compelling series - initiated beautifully in 1992 with this nearly 4-hour episode (the next three episodes were about the same length...PS5 and PS6, which I don't think actually had those titles, were about 2 hours each). Lynda La Plante's script reconsiders the drab police procedural as a breathtaking and life-shaking event. Indeed there is much here that can be savored and appreciated on repeated viewings. Helen Mirren's performance is nothing less than astonishing. She is very human(e) and someone who endures much that both women and men will be able to easily identify and empathize with. However, while this series is certainly welcome (and wanted!) on DVD (although Prime Suspect 1 and 2 were available briefly on DVD in 1998 - and now out of print), this new edition - issued in 2003 - may not be the perfect release. (1) There is at least one full scene missing (Tennyson meets George's mother at her seaside rest home). (2) There seemed to be a couple of brief - though not awful - visual glitches on the first disc of my copy. (3) The handsomely packaged 2-disc set is quite expensive. None of these reasons is meant to fend anyone off of such an incredible performance (Dame Mirren) and one of the best crime series ever aired on TV. But such great work certainly deserves a little better attention.",1067644800,6,1373,4.773109243697479
937875,4,6304911599,"This DVD is the first in a series of police mini-series starring Helen Mirren as Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison.
Despite comments elsewhere, they were made by Granada for ITV (Main Commercial Channel) NOT the BBC.  Each episode is designed
around a 5 minute commercial break roughly every 30 minutes.
At the core of each is the tension between a woman leader in a male environment, trying to hunt down murderers.  The question the men always ask is: Can she handle it?
We see Tennison both at work and her personal life. The two are frequently in conflict.
The procedure shown is correct at the time each programme was made.  Senior police officers in British forces tend to have titles which are closer to their French counterparts (Superintendant, Inspector) than their American colleagues.",1061942400,5,801,5.007518796992481

In this superbly performed thriller, the focus is not so much in the gory details of a serial killer murders, but in the kind of pressure that woman inspector Tennison has to handle when taking over the investigation, thus stepping into a men's world. She had an idea of what was going to happen, and she is prepared to face the downright rejection of the all-male team supposed to work under her orders. What she is not so well prepared for is the consequences that her dedication to her work will have in her personal life. And underneath the whole thriller plot, we can sense dark and dirty secrets among some of the police officers that Tennison can only begin to grasp.

Mirren adds a definitive credibility to the vulnerable character of Tennison, struggling for any reasonable work/life balance, and she proves to be the most interesting sleuth to come out of England since Sherlock Holmes.

937879,5,6304911599,"There are very few television programs I would consider buying on DVD, but this is definitly one of them.
Watching Prime Suspect on DVD is a real treat. If you saw it in America on PBS, you don't realize how much  continuity and tension are lost by all of the inevitable pledge breaks.
Helen Mirren is nothing short of brilliant as Inspect Jane Tennison, the  first woman to hold the post of D.C.I. (Deputy Chief Inspector) on a major  homicide investigation. She must not only solve a series of murders, but  battle sexism and sabotoge within her department.
Great acting in the  supporting roles and a first rate script (written by Linda LaPlante)are  enough to carry this story. But what really sets it apart is how it manages  to get you rooting for Jane Tennison without being cloying or sentimental.  We see this woman as a human being, warts and all. Her obsession with work  leads her to neglect her relationships. She is quick to anger. Sometimes  her first judgement is not the right one. But through it all you want her  to succeed. She gives everything to her job.
If you like mysteries or  police stories, this is as fine as piece of television as you'll see.

She's beautiful and glowing, so we believe the serial romances.  She's tough and unrelenting, and we see her go toe to toe with any man, armed or not.  When she goes home to an empty apartment with lean cuisine and a bottle of wine, the audience can palpably feel the loneliness of this character.  She's vulnerable and she's professional.  This great portrayal is enough reason to watch the show.

However, great writing, incredible ensemble cast and characterizations, and an unswerving commitment to realism have simply ruined nearly all other television and movies for me.

938012,2,6304911599,"Prime Suspect 1, 1991 film

This 1991 film begins at night when cars drive down the street. The police arrive to see the body of a young woman. She has been dead for 1 to 2 hours [but her blood is not black and clotted].A small black book is given to the detective in charge, John Shefford. The blood type is analyzed from the fluid. There is a match on the computer to a man recently released from prison for a rape. George Marlow is arrested and interrogated. [The personal life of Jane Tennison pads out the story.] The lead detective has a heart attack; who will replace him? DCI Tennison wants what she should have. The victim was incorrectly identified as Della Mornay so the body must be identified from the missing persons report. [Does all that smoking have symbolism?] The details of the crime are explicit; the victims were tortured before death.

The policemen resent their first woman detective [a subplot]. The victim was identified (Karen Howard). Her boyfriend knows nothing since they broke up. Suspect Marlow is released for lack of evidence. Then another victim is found, this is Della Mornay who rented the small flat. Where are the missing pages from Della's diary? The same torture marks as on Karen. DCI Tennison goes on live TV to get witnesses or find the missing car. Someone calls in as a witness, but identifies another man. The investigation goes on. [There is more padding to fill up time.] Tennison discovers something while working late and goes to Oldham. Re-interviewing witnesses finds a new fact that wasn't in the reports. Is there another suspect? But Tennison may be off the case. What is the connection between the victims? An assistant notices a connection. Moira is brought in for questioning. Will she talk? When George and Moira leave their flat they are followed by the police. There is a shocking discovery! [Now you know how it will end.] There is an arrest of a suspect for the six murders. Questioning continues until an emotional outburst and a final admission. The courtroom scene will have a final surprise.

This is an interesting story in spite of the padding and interpersonal conflicts. I suspect Moira knew more that what she told. The hidden agenda is to show the police biased against a female chief detective. We don't know how true this is in England or other European countries. The suspect seems to hold a low-paying job but can afford to rent a large garage and let someone else hold the key. The one redeeming value of this film is its display of urban scenery. Was the cast larger than necessary?",1242259200,9,2562,4.714285714285714
938013,4,6304911599,"This is one of those series that I hated, but not because it wasn't good.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that annoyance was one of the things the producers were aiming for.  Unlike other mysteries with women leads (Blue Murder and Murder in Suburbia, to name two), DCI Jane Tennison is not accepted as head of the investigation when she takes over.  The police force is still very sexist, and the show highlights this at every turn.  It's infuriating to watch, though probably still very true of many places today.  So perhaps it's a little preachy, teaching the lesson of equality and all, but it's good that it's out there to show what it was like for women trying to climb into a man's world, and not sugar-coating it.

The mystery itself was very well done.  It'll have you second-guessing your second-guesses, and there are plenty of false leads and mis-information.  My only complaint is not as much with the show as it is with the CDs.  All four episodes are the same story, and I don't understand why they wouldn't have fit on one disk.  It would have been better to have all four episodes on the first disk, so you could just play it all the way through, and all the extras on the other disk, to watch if you wanted.  Instead they have two episodes and some special features on each disk.  A minor annoyance, and I didn't deduct from the rating for it, but it was something I disliked.

If you like gritty police crime dramas, this is a show for you.  It's outspoken and doesn't pull any punches.",1241222400,6,1500,4.446886446886447

It is hard not to like her, she is one tough-minded chick, a bit power-hungry maybe but she had to assert herself in the boy's club that is the police force. She is also a multi-dimensional character, she is by no means perfect. The series reminds me a bit of ""Wire"", arguably the best TV series in the States. Both ""Wire"" and ""Prime Suspects"" deal with a complex world we live in, trust me, it is not all about solving crimes.  Helen Mirren might be solving a crime on TV, we will probably pay to watch Helen Mirren do anything, shopping, reading a phone book, changing diapers. With her Oscar win she justified herself as one of the best actresses around. The whole series is highly recommended.

938060,5,6304911599,"1992's ""Prime Suspect 1"" matches up superb British actress Helen Mirren with her signature role as tough, ambitious and flawed Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison.  In this, the opening production of what became a long-running series on PBS, DCI Tennison gets her big break when the lead DCI on a rape and murder cased dies of a heart attack.  Tennison convinces her reluctant boss to let her take over the case but she must face down resistance from the boys club murder squad.

The story itself is an intriguing and gritty murder mystery that becomes more complicated in each of its four component episodes.  What seemed like a basic rape/murder is complicated by the discovery of an additional body and the possibility that both murders, and others, may be the work of a serial killer.  The investigation is hindered by a inside cover-up to protect the original investigating officer, and by a lack of definitive evidence.  Tennison and her crew must sort through a frustrating series of red herrings and blind alleys to get to the truth.  The writers of this production were wildly successful in maintaining the suspense to the very end.

DCI Tennison is a highly capable police officer but distinctly a flawed hero.  She is smart, persistent, and empathetic with the victims in the case.  She is prepared to overturn every available rock to find the killer, but only her skill in office politics keeps her from being taken off the case when she steps on toes within the department.  Her relentless drive and ambition cause her to slight her relationships with her live-in boyfriend (Tom Wilkinson) and her family.  Her ruthlessness in solving the case takes her right to the limit of the law and perhaps a bit more, while her heavy drinking and smoking foreshadow future health problems.

""Prime Suspect 1"" is very highly recommended as a superb British police procedural and as the opening act in a long-running and very successful crime drama series.",1211155200,,1961,4.906060606060606

938063,5,6304911599,"This is a general review, meant to encompass the entire ""Prime Suspect"" series. DCI Jane Tennison, by far, is one of the most complex female characters ever written for television. She is layered, she is difficult and she is sublime. She is a character that many women can relate to. Her depth dives fathoms deep. She's soft and she's surly. She's a woman navigating the world and landscape of men; but her woman's heart is never absent.

Dame Helen Mirren, a mistress of her craft, has not shied away from the darker sides of this character, as can be seen in ""Prime Suspect Seven."" American television could learn a lot from this series of stories. Our counterparts, across the pond, show us how to get it done.

These stories are not for the faint of heart. They're gritty, realistic and heart-wrenching. They're about character. If you're looking for ""Law & Order,"" they're not for you. But if you're looking for something that delves deeper into the human machine, or character driven stories that make you think, they are definitely for you.

And Jane Tennison, well, she's simply luminous. She's tough and she's admirable, she's weak and she's flawed, and she's REAL!",1195430400,2,1174,4.830845771144278

938119,3,6304911599,"Reviewing the Complete Collection which I bought, this is my review.

One vicious murder/mystery after another.  Incredible acting! (Though the story-lines were extremely brutal.  Also, imo, the male dominance over female Jane T. was a bit overdone, and the horror of the depictions over some long decayed bodies, not to mention the violent ways they were murdered, blood curdling.  Yet the plots themselves were extremely good, if very sadistic.

My main personal objection was that there were no sub-titles with the films, nor did using DVD remotes which provides subtitles when the film itself doesn't, didn't help. All I got was gibberish type. These are the only films out of hundreds I own, that this happened on.  Many films, even most British films provide their own subtitles, even the old ones. Almost all American films provide subs.

As an American, I only caught parts of the language, and that was a huge draw back. This was especially true in neighborhoods where the actors were speaking not only a British dialect, but a foreign British dialect, often very fast, making most of their dialogue impossible to understand. Most of the crimes did occur in such such neighborhoods or in poor neighborhoods where language sounded more like gibberish.  Very frustrating.  Even the cops rarely spoke distinctly, much of it fast and under their breath.  All, except for Jane.  No problem with her.  She spoke clearly, and her British accent didn't distract from understanding what she was saying.

As said before, the police's constant harassment of Helen Mirren (Jane) was a bit over the top and after a few adventures it did became abit tiresome, and made the cops in charge appeared corrupt, which a few were.  Helen Mirren was great as usual, and so was the cast, (which is why I bought the films) but the constant actions of police and their ""lets get Jane"" attitude became annoying as she had proved herself over and over again. Is there really that much anti-feminism and jealousy in the British male police force?

Perhaps the writers just used it as xtra difficulties in Jane's life, as if she didn't have enough on her plate. Big question. Why she stayed on the force was never made clear. Few scenes depicted her as happy.  Every plot was as violent and creepy as the next, and after a while I wasn't sure why I was watching. But you can't help it. This year, I watched them again, but this time it disturbed me more than the first, and so somewhere along the set, I put them away. I did think the first one was the best of the lot. No need to bring it back on disk 4 especially with a different actor as the killer.

Jane had a hard time on her job, and gradually took to drink. An unfortunate ending for a dedicated cop who was one of the few actors whose speech I could understand. Helen Mirren was great, of course.  She always is.

NBC has a new Prime Suspect.  American version.  Don't even bother.  It's just as hard to understand the Amer. English as the British, even if you turn on the sub-titles.  Commericals loom about every few minutes, and they are many and very looong.  By the time the show comes back, you've forgotten where the story line left off.",1184803200,11,3184,4.664874551971326

Tennison is put in charge after one of her fellow DCIs has a heart attack and dies. She inherits the murder case and soon comes across the connected second murder. If trying to solve not one but two rape-murder cases is not enough, Jane's work is complicated by the hostility of her staff. The members of the male-dominated police department feel humiliated and have problems following the orders of the female boss, no matter how intelligent, tough, organized, and fit for the position she is. Tennison's obsession with the cases and fighting for credibility and respect from her colleagues don't help to her relationship with the boyfriend Peter Rawlins (Tom Wilkinson), either. Helen Mirren is superb as DCI Tennison playing the character that is sympathetic, tough, vulnerable, bright, very clever, and sexy - all at the same time. Mirren was voted the sexiest 60+ star in the word few months ago. I think she's been always incredibly attractive and desirable - and always will be. She definitely lit the screen at 46, in her first season of ""Prime Suspect"" (1991). Creator of the show, Lynda La Plante wrote the story that ranks among the best police procedures and it is terrific - complex, dynamic, with unexpected turns, and interesting multidimensional characters. Ralph Fiennes played one of his first roles as a boyfriend of a murdered girl and he was memorable in a very emotional scene opposite Mirren. I look forward for more DVDs with the rest of the seasons coming from Netflix.",1178496000,2,1675,5.007168458781362

938125,5,6304911599,"It is hard to remember that 15 years ago this was a groundbreaking portrayal of police procedures and investigations.  The issues of sex discrimination and entrenched ideas were very relevant when this was first broadcast.  Helen Mirren's portrayal of the ambitious DCI Jane Tennison who gives up so much to be successful drives this very riveting police drama.  It's realistic portrait of a murder investigation set the tone for police dramas to come.  This is not a glamorous world, but one of petty jealousies, of family bitterness, of hours of mundane work, and the occasional breaks that we now take for granted in a dramatic series.

This should be on anyone's ""must have"" list, along with the rest of this compelling series.  Unlike so many other detectives from England, Jane Tennison is not someone who provides a familiar feeling, the neighbor, the co-worker.  Yet her drama is what lifts this production above any contemporary story and can be enjoyed many times without the sense of it being a rerun.

The only problem is that there are only 6 of these remarkable stories to enjoy.",1168300800,,1093,4.9021739130434785

938128,5,6304911599,"Prime Suspect started what has become the best series of detective specials ever.

Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) is a Deputy Chief Inspector (DCI) with the Metropolitan Police in London.  But the Met is an all boys club.  Jane is also starting a new relationship with a divorcee, Peter (Tom Wilkinson).

Episode 1 -

A woman was found brutally murdered in the bed sit (business apartment) of prostitute Della Mornay.  DCI Shefford has been assigned the case.  They find a rare blood type in the bed sit and are able to trace it to a convicted rapist George Marlow.  They arrest and question Marlow and he admits to frequenting Della.  But the quick end of the investigation changes when DCI Shefford has a heart attack and dies.

There is no available DCI's for the case, well no male DCI's.  Jane makes a pitch to her boss and with some trepidation, he gives her the case.  This makes her the first female DCI to handle a murder investigation.  The old boys network circles the wagons to sabotage Jane, lead by Shefford's second Detective Sergeant Bill Otley.

The first thing that Jane does is confirm the victim's identity.  But the victim's finger prints do not match Della's, they must now find out the victim's identity.  They slim down the missing persons to two and Jane visits the family and discovers the girl's identity, Karen Howard.  Now they have to connect Marlow with Karen Howard.

Episode 2 -

The 72 hours is up and Jane must make a decision, charge or release Marlow.  Since she has no compelling evidence, Marlow is released.  This displeases everyone and Otley uses this to his advantage.

Jane realizes something is wrong and looks through a desk and finds the missing Della Mornay file and diary.  The following day Otley has convinced the Superintendent to remove Jane from the case but now Jane has all the cards.  It comes out that not only Shefford but Otley knew Della Mornay.  She was their confidential informant.  Further, there are pages missing from her diary.  It turns out that Shefford also visited Della ""professionally"".

Jane goes on Crime Watch to see if this will yield any clues and it does.  A witness is found and might tie Marlow to Karen Howard.

(Look for Ralph Fiennes at the beginning of the episode as Karen's boyfriend.)

Episode 3 -

When the witness chooses the wrong person from the line up, the investigation is stepped up.  Jane goes to Marlow's employer and finds out that he started with the firm in Manchester and that his common law wife, Moira (Zoe Wannamaker), accompanied him on his sales trips.  Jane gets Marlow's trip records and has the crew match similar murders.  They locate three more homicides.  Also, Jane interviews Marlow's cell mate and finds out that Marlow had a lock-up (rental garage).

In investigating the first suspected linked murder it is found out that Shefford was on the case.  Jane needs to find out if he was involved in the other investigations.  This is the last straw with her boss and is being taken off the case.

Episode 4 -

The crew has determined that enough similarities exist to consider these murders connected.  Now Jane has to figure out what tie Marlow to the victims.  It takes her assistant, a woman, to come up with Moira.  She is a free lance beautician.  Jane brings her in and starts to rattle her.

When her boss ""The Gov"" catches up with her, she is told that all of her crew have refused to allow her removal from the case.  But the good news is interrupted by the news that George and Moira are on the move.

At Euston underground, they split up.  The crew split up to follow them.  While Moira is off shopping, George leads them to the lock-up.  Both are arrested and after she is confronted again, Moira recants her testimony.  Then George confesses of the six cases.

Lynda LaPlante has created one of the great police movies and the greatest female police character.  Helen Mirren gives a magnificent performance as the under appreciated DCI Jane Tennison.  She takes LaPlante's script and hits every nuance to perfection.

This miniseries also featured early performances by future stars including a cameo by Ralph Fiennes, future Oscar nominee Tom Wilkenson as Jane's current boyfriend and a stunning performance by Zoe Wannamaker as Moira, the prime suspect's girlfriend.

This series has spawned five additional miniseries, none of which was a good as the original but better than anything else on television. (The first three won Emmy Awards for Best Mini-Series).

Buy this and the other and have a great time.

938169,5,6304911599,This is the first in the series of one of the best police detective stories ever.  Helen Mirren is masterful in her performance as Jane Tennyson the brilliant female detective creating who handles sexism and interrogating criminals with ease.  She is an intuitive who is adept at psychological warfare as well as handling her team.  In addition it is fascinating to see the British system of justice which in turn creates a window to view British culture.,1142553600,2,455,4.883116883116883

938171,5,6304911599,"DCI Jane Tennison, superbly played by Helen Mirren, is not to be trifled with. Her charging, take-no-prisoners attitude is great fun to watch. She suffers fools poorly . . . or rather they suffer from her. Why do these chauvinists love to pick fights with her? Personally, I'd give her wide berth! Prime Suspect begins the six-part series.

Full disclosure . . . I'm a flag waving, red state kind of guy. My gastritis flairs when I confess the Brits blow us out of the pond in dramatic construction. These dramas are not just good. They're awesome. Each is exquisitely plotted with three dimensional characters(maybe Jane has five dimensions). The action in the squad room has a documentary feel to it.

It is a joy to watch DCI Jane in action; a role made for Helen Mirren. She flirts with you, insults you, kicks you, and always fights for justice. Usually in a multi-part series such as Prime Suspect, I will have a favorite . . .but this is not true here: each is a gem.",1137369600,83,974,4.528409090909091
938172,4,6304911599,"I think the serial killer plot has been done to death, but back when the Prime Suspect series started, it didn't seem tired.

It was very enjoyable to see this program again, so long after it was on television. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. I think the editing could be tighter. But the plot and the acting can't be faulted.

As all the men on the detective squad are so ""shocked"" at a woman being put in charge of an investigation -- this aspect of the movie seems very dated now.

Contrary to another reviewer, I found the DVD quality very good. This was made for TV and one cannot expect the same vivid image of a theatrical feature. Two dual-layer discs for a 210 minute program certainly provides sufficient data rate.

Personally, I don't think this has good replay value, unless you intend to wait another ten years to watch it again. As such, the product seems overpriced to me. This is probably a better candidate for a rental.",1135728000,7,954,4.403409090909091

938175,5,6304911599,"In a typically understated British fashion, Prime Suspect delivers excellent performances by an edgy, raucous cast of locker-room cops and a steely-eyed, ambitious female Detective Chief Inspector (DCI), Tennison. She is cold and analytical, difficult to warm up to. Yet the plot works as she is pitted against a cadre of wary, cocky, antagonistic, young detectives in a race against the clock.

A prostitute has been brutally beaten and killed. Marlow is the prime suspect in the murder investigation. He remains the prime suspect throughout, and the viwer joins th einvestigation team to find other suspects. Undermined from within at every turn, DCI Tennison remains stubbornly resilient and determined to lead her unruly bunch of detectives through the painstaking process of solid detective work to solve this difficult case.

Somehow it all works marvelously well and the viewer is left to hoist a toast to the modern-day Miss Marple, ""Here, here!"" Quite so.",1120521600,4,964,5.294117647058823

938177,4,6304911599,"The Prime Suspect series is unusual in that Jane Tennison as portrayed by Helen Mirren is not very endearing or likeable-and yet the storys work.  Seeking to advance her career at every oportunity, even if it mean stabbing her co-workers in the back, Tennison represents unbridled ambition--in series 3, going as far as not pursuing completion of her investigation into a pedophile ring--on the condition that she receive a promotion.
Strange behavior--probably more realistic--but definitely less idealistic.  Regardless, like the less than heroic ""Cracker"" as portrayed by Robbie Coltrane--this series is very interesting and well worth owning.
This particular episode finds Tennison's romantic life crumbling as she pursues a serial killer, though she seems as relentless in promoting herself as she does in capturing the guity party!
At 208 minutes--this episode is a little too much for viewing all at once--but watched a disc at a time--it's very good entertainment!",1078876800,3,972,5.473333333333334
