5086062,4,B007HCI3XU,Solid four star throw-back heist movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.,1417564800,,78,5.583333333333333
5086063,1,B007HCI3XU,Very old film that didn't indicate the year of production in the description.  Poor quality filming and very slow.  I only watched 15 minutes.,1413676800,,142,4.875
5086064,4,B007HCI3XU,"Starts out kind of lame, but quickly grabs your interest and just gets better. This was certainly better than most of the super promoted shows that are pushed at us. a real sleeper.",1412812800,,181,4.515151515151516

5086069,1,B007HCI3XU,Terrible effort with a lame ending which you can probably guess the outcome of this TV Movie. Do not waste your time or money!,1399680000,,126,4.291666666666667
5086070,5,B007HCI3XU,"In this, his only film, Freddie really showed his acting chops!! His performance as Muff Kovack was neither over nor under acted. The plot is questionable, but considering the era when it was filmed (the 70s) it is good. The supporting cast was very good.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this film as a MUST SEE for anyone who still associate FREDDIE PRINZE SR with his character FRANCISCO ""CHICO"" RODRIGUEZ.",1398384000,2,398,4.852941176470588
5086071,5,B007HCI3XU,"Freddie Prinze proved in this movie that he could have handled dramatic roles as well.  I read he wasn't happy with this movie but I enjoyed it very much.  The cast was very good too.  I won't give anything away but I do recommend this movie for anyone who hasn't seen Freddie outside Chico and The Man or even the comedy stage.  It is something different and I'd say it's a must for any Freddie Prinze fan.  Highly recommended.

Freddie's Dead was a song back in dah day and it might have been a eulogy to his early death!  They said it was an OD, but what drove him to do it~????",1434758400,,254,3.9607843137254903
