Also, I loved the song at the end of movie so much I rewound and watched that part over a couple of times just to hear the end song. Here's my full review: [...]",1467417600,3,257,3.8679245283018866
6248561,4,B00I3V94MS,"What can I say about Apocalypse Kiss? If you can imagine Dick Tracy in a Dystopian Future you will have a small idea of what this movie brings to the table. First off the cyberpunk style visuals, background and ambiance were just cool as hell. I have to admit being a huge fan of cyberpunk style sci-fi, that was the first thing to draw me to this film. Secondly, AK had a terrific cast including; D.C. Douglas, Tom Detrik, Carmela Hayslett-Grillo, and Tammy Jean who all gave amazing performances portraying these very well written and rich characters. The cast also included legendary actors Tom Atkins as Captain John Vogle, Michael Berryman as David Horn, and The President played very fittingly by the always awesome, Lloyd Kaufman. Thirdly I can tell a lot of love, care, blood, sweat and tears were put into the making of AK by Writer/Director/Editor Christian Jude Grillo, and Producer John Kent and the rest of the incredibly hard working crew. Kudos to all of them on a job very well done.

I'm not one of those reviewers that explains the entire story of the film because, quite frankly I really hate that. So I'm just going to say the film's narrative draws you in and keeps you intrigued until it's conclusion. I enjoyed Apocalypse Kiss a great deal and recommend it to anyone who's looking for a refreshing change from their usual cinematic forte.",1430524800,5,1361,4.718487394957983

6248563,1,B00I3V94MS,"In all honesty, if you're going to try and create a Bladerunner like sci-fi thriller you first need to get a budget and a decent script. Apocalypse Kiss has neither.

First of all, I'll give most movies a bit of thought before I decide whether I like it, or don't like it. Now this movie is neither a drama, an action movie, nor a comedy, it's more like a BAD STAGE PLAY. The acting was just amateur, especially the two leading ladies are the worst in the cast. The camera work was noticeably bad. The effects were goofy and tacky, the dialogue was cringe-fully bad, the casting was all wrong, everything and I mean everything about this movie was both LAZY and BORING. There was nothing about this movie that I liked, in fact I'll go one step further and say, it was just plain AWFUL.

All in all, this movie was an incredibly bad, low budget, poorly acted steaming pile of horrible. Don't waste your time and money.

DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. You have been warned.",1401321600,7,963,4.398876404494382

6248565,4,B00I3V94MS,"Apocalypse Kiss is the perfect scifi thriller for the average film viewer. It seems like the film literally tore pages from Blade Runner and Repo: The Genetic Opera, yet it remains 100% original. The despite an audio flaw in the beginning and some unwanted nudity (you'll see what I mean...) the movie is flawless and oozing with creativity. While I was hoping for a little bit more horror/scifi, I ended up getting more character development and celebrity cameos that more than made up for it. A great movie to add to your collection, Apocalypse Kiss goes to show that the folks at Potent Media are a jack of all genres.",1396828800,11,621,4.654545454545454

Gotta say, the movie gave me the exact result without my wife having to clean up the mess.  This movie is in no doubt as depressing as Schindler's list. The protagonist's consisted of a deaf mute and her lesbian translator that kill a Ron Jeremy impersonator (old Ron, not young Ron)  then get in trouble with a narcissistic serial killer with mother issues.  That's about as far as i got before the darkness enveloped me with it's welcoming arms.

But I actually enjoyed the movie (after surviving the first maybe 10-15 minutes when I thought about bailing on it).  It's a well-conceived plot of stories that eventually intertwine (but not necessarily a great screenplay), and once the movie got rolling I found myself enjoying it.  I would describe this as a hybrid of part B-movie sci-fi (a post-apocalyptic future vibe), part crime-drama (hard-boiled detective), and a big heaping helping of a modern Film Noir flavor.  And balance the Film Noir 'downer' with a tongue-in-cheek 'upper' for humor.  The humor is either an accidental outcome of a poor screenplay and stereotyped characters, or a very clever outcome of a movie that might be more intentionally tongue-in-cheek than I'm giving it credit for.  Judge for yourself.  If I explain in any more detail, it would be entirely spoilers.",1469577600,6,1038,4.9479768786127165

Gladys has to do the body to body grind and Kat comes to her rescue, knife in hand.

Spoiler Alert:
Turn there's Adrian, a self centered arrogant twit.  He's the Red Harvest Cleaner.  He's also a programmer of sorts who sees the ladies come in and are identified as intruders and turns off the alarms.

Finally, there's Jerry, a detective who talks as though he's a 1940s dick in a seedy novel.

6248620,2,B00I3V94MS,"The important stuff out of the way first. Within the first 5 minutes of this film you will see an obese man in a full monty-type pose. If male genitilia makes you cringe you have a couple of scenes at the beginning so plan on looking at it for around 10 seconds. As for female nudity, the blonde is topless for a few scenes in the first half of the movie and that's about it. As for the movie itself... it sort of wants to be three different movies. One is an apocalyptic movie that just is just background dressing until the very end. It doesn't make a lot of sense and seems tacked on. The second is a homeless lesbian couple that you really don't care about doing what they have to do to survive. They take up the first part of the film. The third story revolves around a serial killer who taunts a ""police officer"" (corporate security in this futuristic setting) and their confrontation (which is anticlimactic). This was filmed in some hanger out in LA most likely and you can tell it sort of wants to be an avant garde film because of the clothing/set pieces. I gave it 2 stars because at least it had something like a plot and the blonde did have nice fake breasts (although I'm not a fan of artificial she must have had a nice surgeon). The rest of the movie was just horrible however and the ending made no sense. I would pass on this one.",1468713600,,1348,4.249027237354086

There were many elements of this independent film that reminded me of the series Lexx, back in the 1990s, as there are loads of dark comedy throughout the film.  As other reviewers have stated, it is obvious of the film's Blade Runner influences, but that is more with the scenery and backdrop of the city itself.

We have a serial killer, a lesbian couple that robs to survive, and a private detective on their trails in a world standing on the brink of destruction.  I will not give away too much as it is better to watch this film without knowing a lot about the back story and let the story drag you along with it.
