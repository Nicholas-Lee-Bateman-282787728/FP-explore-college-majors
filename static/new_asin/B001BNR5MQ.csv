3496563,4,B001BNR5MQ,This look at the apocrypha helps discerning viewers understand a fuller context of Bible reading with stories that were accepted fully in there day alongside canonized scripture. Enjoyed the fine attention to detail and the hands-on approach to the forgotten and often hidden truth of the Bible. Context is everything. How can we possibly comprehend a 2000 year old culture today? How foolish we are to assume we have THE answers.,1354752000,5,430,5.070422535211268

3496565,5,B001BNR5MQ,"When I first obtained a library card for my young daughter, I was asked whether I wanted her selections to be limited in any way.  I said that I did not!  Even though she was young, she was bright, able and willing to learn.  I have ALWAYS been offended by censorship; by someone else deciding what knowledge to which I should and should not have access.

As of this writing, I have watched the entire first part of this two part series.  The History Channel did a spectacular job presenting information from a wide variety of writings that were omitted from the bible.  As each work is discussed, respected theologians and academicians explain in plain language why they believe the work was omitted.  In some cases, the explanation is simply that the work was written or found too late for inclusion in the officially recognized versions of the bible.  In other cases, the work presents information that early religious leaders did NOT want the laity to know about.  Works that presented opinions differing from or contrary to official dogma, including writings that suggested a much more significant role for women in religion, were censored!

If you are interested in exploring these works for the first time; if you are interested in learning and deciding for yourself, this DVD is an excellent place to start!  As a series of history lessons, it is NEVER dry or boring.  It is lively, thought provoking and uniformly fascinating!",1231718400,24,1435,4.836065573770492

3496570,1,B001BNR5MQ,"I guess if I knew what I was getting into, I would not have ordered this. Once we got to Jesus being married to Mary Magdelene and having children with her, that's where I turned it off. I have never watched the rest. These are the Gnostic Gospels, the 52 texts discovered in Nag Hammadi, Egypt include 'secret' gospels poems and myths attributing to Jesus sayings and beliefs which are very different from the New Testament.",1466553600,9,425,4.605263157894737

3496576,4,B001BNR5MQ,"I really like reading about early Christianity....and especially the Bible.  But I still can't figure out why some of those ancient writings were omitted from the Bible since after Chapter 2 of Genesis the Bible is basically a religious history of the  Jews.  I've read the Book of Enoch.  I've read the Book of Jubilees, I've read the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.  I read the Gospel of Thomas.  I 've read the Story of Adam and Eve.  All of these books were interesting to me and I would believe to any researcher.  I've found only a few incidences that seem to clash with current Christian dogma.  And, in as much as the Bible may have been the 'inspired'  word of God, we must never forget that it was also written by men, humans like ourselves, capable of error and prone to mistakes.  But God is personal to me and the opinions of others are theirs, not mine.",1441152000,22,861,4.420382165605096
3496577,3,B001BNR5MQ,"I bought Banned from the Bible 1 & 11. I like them but there were areas where the background music was so loud I couldn't hear the narrator.
It was so FRUSTRATING! And the narrator had a rather soft voice at times. Don't the producers of DVDs ever listen to their own product?",1439683200,21,276,4.226415094339623

3496582,5,B001BNR5MQ,"This is a great series and should be included in any Bible study program.  I have so many friends and relatives who profess to be ""good Christians"" and can quote you chapter and verse from the Bible, yet they have absolutely no knowledge of the history of their religion or any understanding of how the Bible came to be.  Learning the historical facts in no way damages faith in one's beliefs.  Toddlers and young children may be too young to understand, but ""Banned From The Bible"" is appropriate for anyone from middle-school age through adult years.",1406851200,3,552,4.729166666666667

3496585,5,B001BNR5MQ,"This explores a lot of the books left out the final cut of the bible and the way people decided what was and what wasn't suitable to be cannon. And it does so in an interesting way while telling some of the lost stories from these books.
I wish more people would watch this.",1356220800,3,274,4.092592592592593
