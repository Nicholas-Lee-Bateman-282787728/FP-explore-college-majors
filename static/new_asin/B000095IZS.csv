1879971,5,B000095IZS,"I'm very glad I purchased this box set, I think it was more than worth it. It includes so many episodes and I personally consider the Piccolo/Goku fight to be one of the greatest of all anime/manga, so it's cool to be able to watch it at any time. I also enjoy this set for the Japanese version, which is awesome to me.
I highly recommend it for dragonball fans (like myself) :), it's a great set to add to your dvd collection.",1079568000,4,427,4.156626506024097

Once again Goku must save the world from King Piccolo, only reincarnated as Piccolo Jr.  Their epic battle is magnificent to watch.  Can Goku finally win a tournament?  After the fighting is done, this set also includes Goku and Chi Chi's wedding.  Will it be a happy occassion, or tragedy?  This set includes the final episodes of Dragon Ball and officially begins the Dragon Ball Z story line.  I recommend these episodes to any DB or DBZ fan.  The fights are very graphic, one scene with Piccolo's arm comes to mind, and action packed. It is a worthy finale to Dragon Ball.",1152489600,,644,4.6371681415929205
