8355988,5,B00288W2FI,"Unlike other reviewers on Amazon I have actually watched all content on all 3 Blu-Ray discs. I have to report that all discs playback perfectly in USA made Blu-Ray players. You do not need a modified or Region B Blu-Ray player.

These 3 Blu-Ray discs are Region A compatible. The discs are all region free. All special features are region free.

The bonus material on two discs are in standard definition 576p. This is a PAL resolution and will not play back properly unless you have a TV that supports 576p resolution. My TV is a Panasonic ZT-60 that supports 576p and I can verify that all special features on all discs work perfectly.

1. Encounters at the End of the World
Feature Film: 1080p
All special features are 1080p

2. Grizzly Man
Feature film: 1080p
All special features are 576p

3. The White Diamond
Feature film: 1080p
All special features are 576p

La Soufriere and The Flying Doctors of East Africa are included as bonus features on The White Diamond Blu-Ray. They are presented in 576p SD.

Aspect ratio: La Soufriere 1.33:1
Aspect ratio: The Flying Doctors of East Africa 1.37:1

La Soufriere and The Flying Doctors of East Africa are exclusive to this Blu-Ray box set as extras on The White Diamond Blu-Ray.

None of these movies will be released in the upcoming Werner Herzog Blu-Ray box from USA Shout! Factory or the BFI UK Blu-Ray box set.",1403740800,2,1365,4.654166666666667

8355990,1,B00288W2FI,"The main reason I rushed to buy this set was to see La Soufiere and The Flying Doctors of East Africa since they were previously unavailable or hard to find. Unfortunately they don't work! All special features seem to work on all discs except for The White Diamond, clicking on them only returns you to the main menu. I am so pissed off I spent my money on this and waiting with such anticipation and now I have to go through a return process at my own shipping expense. Does anyone have a clue why this is? I see reviews of all titles on here, is it working for anyone else? I want these titles on blu-ray but I'm not going to re-order it if it doesn't work.",1353196800,,659,4.15625
8355991,5,B00288W2FI,"Herzog on Blu-Ray? Of Course!
While an odd collection of his work, to be sure, this collection does make a little sense. The characters that try, and sometimes succeed, to live beyond the told and tried world are all here. But the landscapes are always the central character. If I were to choose, I would certainly have chosen other films.  Scream of Stone or Dark Glow of the Mountains, perhaps. So What?  I was surprised to see Grizzly Man so popular when it came out, so what do I know?  While some of his newer films have been strangely other than what I am used to, I cannot fault him for doing what he does.  He makes me scratch my head often, and I love that. The films presented here are somewhat of a jumble, but they do have a common thread. Timothy (Grizzly Man) tried to do what all Herzog heroes do, to live outside, beyond. White Diamond's protagonist is a dreamer in that same sense. And oh, so tragic, and flawed. Encounters saw some praise, but also was more or less about the people that live that life so far south of the rest of us. There are threads that run through Herzog films that reflect the maker, and all are present here. He is the man with the courage to risk death to film a volcano exploding, and so are the figures he shows us. It is the reflection of our best hopes and fears, or the terror of our impotence and self-destruction. But there is also the inspiration of what we could be, if only we could find our true potential.  This is all meager prose, and his films really do speak for themselves. I, myself, am happy to get all these films in the best format possible. I gave my copy of Encounters to a dear friend to share with her kids, now that I have a double.  Films should be shared, and Herzog should be shared with the entire world.",1290470400,,1777,4.273809523809524
8355992,5,B00288W2FI,"This is a majority of Herzog's movies that are currently on Blu-ray. I recommend this set to anyone who like nature films, Werner Herzog or documentaries. I couldn't recommend it more highly in any case. I'm a little biased to be posting a review though.",1286064000,,254,4.666666666666667
