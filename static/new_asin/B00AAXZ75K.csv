5407858,4,B00AAXZ75K,"This latest Mike Newell (Four Weddings and A Funeral, Love in the Time of Cholera, The Awakening etc.) version of Charles Dickens' `Great Expectations' opens with daylight location shots on the salt marshes and, while looking remote and bleak, these aren't the atmospheric mist-swathed shots of earlier studio-based versions of the story.  Similarly Newell opens up the acting, giving us naturalistic performances rather than the usual Dickensian parade of over-acted grotesque caricatures. However, unfortunately no one bothered to explain this to David Walliams who's Mr. Pumblechook is firmly in the tradition of a gurning `Mr. Fuzzywig' - like one of his characters from `Little Britain'.

The film does look great, from the salt marshes of the Kent coast to the recreated crowded streets of old London town, and also features wonderful costumes. The naturalistic acting by the main characters - Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers etc. - seems to slightly lessen their profile in the drama and heighten the role of the central character, Jeremy 'Warhorse' Irvine as Pip Pirrip, and this makes it all the more shocking that as Pip becomes a gentleman he also becomes a terrible snob who forgets his roots. Newell does get excellent (if slightly restrained) performances from Helena Bonham Carter as Miss Havisham, Ralph Fiennes as Magwitch, Robbie Coltrane as Mr. Jaggers and Jason Flemyng as Joe ""What larks, Pip"" Gargery, as well as the supporting characters including Holliday Grainger, Ewen Bremner, Sally Hawkins and Tamzin Outhwaite.

Unfortunately there have been so many versions of this story, from the classic David Lean film of 1946 to the numerous TV serials including the recent one with Ray Winstone as Magwich, that any dramatic impact the story once had has now gone.  Nonetheless, I did find this an engaging adaptation and any reservations I did have were more to do with the slightly clunky nature of the plot as we reach the rather unsatisfactory denouement of the novel itself.  I think that younger viewers would particularly enjoy this film (if they still watch non vampire-related drama).

The DVD features extras including ""Introducing Great Expectations"", ""The characters of Great Expectations"" (Pip, Miss Havisham, Magwitch), ""Deleted and extended scenes"" and ""Still photos"". Generally I found these extras a bit dull and would have liked more on the making of the film - locations, costumes etc. or more about dramatising Dickens.",1364774400,7,2459,5.276214833759591

5407862,3,B00AAXZ75K,"The Cliff Notes version of GE. Fast paced, not much time for character development. And unless you're familiar with the plot beforehand here's thinking you'll be lost but quick, carried along so speedily amongst the meanderings within.

As stated by other reviewers characters crucial to the book never make an appearance. Vital links of the story chain are missing so you're left with fleeting impressions that don't quite add up to a cohesive whole.

Also too, some the actors look contemporary, and act so, even dressed in period garb. Especially Helena Bonham Carter as Miss Havisham. Her Miss H is more of a boho hipster goth steampunk princess who favors vintage white instead of black.

And most importantly, and super sadly for me, I didn't feel the romance between Pip (Jeremy Irvine) and Estella (Holliday Grainger). As played in this film you'd have no clue why Pip would be so besotted with Estella after such a quick acquaintance made earlier in his childhood. Nothing ... save maybe she's kinda pretty. And one of the only girls in the neighborhood.

On the plus side this film is gorgeous, the cinematography sumptuous. It's an easy afternoon's viewing. And if you know the Dickens story, another adaptation to notch into your belt.

Otherwise give it a pass in favor of a meatier version. Of which there are a few.",1501459200,,1330,4.867256637168142

5407881,4,B00AAXZ75K,"This is a great story that no one has ever messed up too badly. There are several entries that are beautifully filmed and well directed. What makes this one stand out is the acting of the principals. Though Helena Bonham Carter was not quite what I expected, (liked Gillian
Anderson's portrayal better) Ralph Fiennes was a powerful Magwitch, both savage and sympathetic. Jeremy Irvine (as Pip) and Holliday Grainger (as Estella) had what is often missing in on screen romances - chemistry! It helps, of course, that Miss Grainger is sufficiently beautiful to drive any man to gnaw his hand off at the wrist, but she had the chops to portray a young woman torn by emotional conflict. Robbie Coltrane as Jaggers was great, as usual. Jason Flemyng as Joe Gargery and Jessie Cave as Biddy were just plain lovable, Ben Lloyd-Hughes as Bentley Drummle was hate-able, and Ewen Bremner as Wemmick was a revelation, I have never seen this beloved son of the Aged P brought so realistically and vividly to life. Worth another look at this great story!",1470096000,,1041,4.788888888888889
5407882,3,B00AAXZ75K,"The movie was well made, though the pacing felt rushed, especially at the beginning, and while I understand the need to condense the plot, I didn't appreciate the changes they made to the characters. Essentially they tried to change the expansive, autobiographical nature of the story into a condensed romance tale. Thus they tried to play up the ""romance"" throughout, but in doing so, they lost a lot of the depth and strength of the story, particularly in Estella's character. By trying to soften her and make her into a more tragic figure, they ended up making her weak and pitiful. That, combined with their softening of Ms. Havisham's character, created various plot holes and places where the characters' motivations no longer made sense. The Finches of the Grove ascended from a sort of passing mention in the book to a central part of the movie's plot meant to emphasize their version of Pip and Estella's relationship. This took away from other, far more important plot points which got cut out entirely, likely to make room for the absurd and pointless antics of the aforementioned Finches. Orlick doesn't appear in the movie at all, and Herbert's presence is weak and understated. I appreciated that certain characters who were missing entirely from the 2011 BBC miniseries (by far my favorite version of the story) appeared in this one, but felt that the other characters they cut out to make room for them were more important to the plot, and the swap was not an equal one.",1468281600,9,1486,4.8313725490196076

5407892,4,B00AAXZ75K,It was a good representation.  I also showed an older version to my class (with Michael York and Sara Miles).

5407893,3,B00AAXZ75K,"I think I would watch just about any adaptation of ""Great Expectations.""  It's a great story, and there are so many characters of interest that it's almost inevitable that you'll see some fine performances.  There's Alec Guinness, Finlay Currie, and John Mills in David Lean's 1946 film.  There are Ray Winstone as Magwitch and Gillian Anderson as Miss Havisham in a 3-part BBC version from 2011, and now there's this Mike Newell film -- coming in at approximately the same length as Lean's -- with Ralph Fiennes (Magwitch) and Helena Bonham-Carter (Miss Havisham).  It's not bad at all, and it has a pair of young leads who have some chemistry between them, unlike Douglas Booth and Vanessa Kirby in the 2011 version.  Pip and Estella as adults are played by Jeremy Irvine and Holliday Grainger respectively, and they do very well.  The relationship of Estella to Miss Havisham is very well realized by Grainger and Bonham-Carter.  And just as Gillian Anderson's Miss Havisham was memorable in the 2011 series, so is Helena Bonham-Carter's, in a completely different interpretation but one that she makes compelling -- she's much more manipulative, controlled and controlling, and even playful than Gillian Anderson's marvelous self-harming, twitchy wreck.  Ralph Fiennes is convincing and powerful as Magwitch, but he's at a disadvantage compared to Ray Winstone in the 2011 series.  Simply put, we don't see enough of him after his return from exile.  The director Mike Newell brings his movie in at around 2 hours -- the series ran for three, and as a result we get a better feeling for a developing relationship between Pip and Magwitch after the shock of Magwitch's revelation.  And Winstone had time to develop Magwitch more fully as a character, and he gave a wonderful portrayal that blended humor and sentiment to an extent that Fiennes doesn't have a chance to do.  I should add that Robbie Coltrane is a nasty piece of work as Jaggers, and very effective with it.  In 2011, David Suchet's Jaggers, equally effective, was much more sympathetic, more like a decent man in a nasty business, hence the hand-washing made sense. So -- even though this movie has some real strengths that the series doesn't (mainly in the younger characters' casting), I've come to feel that one really needs a series to do justice to the book.  The moral center has to be Pip'sgrown-up travails, and one needs to see these develop over time to have plausibility.  Newell's scriptwriters do a fine job of getting a lot of information to us, but a lot of it is in narration by characters.  We need to see more and hear about it less.

Of course, the whole opening movement of the book is almost begging to be dramatized, and all three versions I've seen so far are marvellously effective -- and in the showing of the marsh country, they are the most beautifully realized part of the book in sheer visual terms.  There's so much to get into Pip's London story that it must be much more difficult to condense and dramatize, and yet that's where the moral interest of the story lies.  My next ""Great Expectations,"" when I get around to it, will be another serialized version.  I hear Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham is worth seeing.  But -- this one is by no means bad.",1453507200,2,3256,4.799283154121864

The only deviation, to my mind, was the omission of the character Orlick.  As for the movie itself, the acting is superb, the scenes are just as I pictured them as I read the book, a lot of the dialogue is almost verbatim as it was in the book, and the actors are very well chosen to play their respective roles.

As I was saying (apparently you don't want to press enter/return or it will submit your review), this rendition of ""Great Expectations"" is disjointed and the plot is full of holes due to the director's take on the story. Throughout the movie my wife was complaining about how hard it was to follow the direction of the plot since there were many cuts to portions of the story that didn't seem to fit with other elements. She called it ""abrupt and a shallow portrayal of the characters and plotline.""

I enjoyed the acting by masterful artists such as Ralph Fiennes, but seeing Miss Havisham portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter was a disappointment since Miss H. is supposed to be a codgery, ill-used old woman instead of a young, bosomy, insane actress.

The woman who played Mrs. Clennam in ""Little Dorrit""Judy Parfitt who also played a similar codgery old woman in Stephen King's ""Delores Claiborne"" would've done a much better job as Miss H. Not worth renting in my humble opinion. You're better off renting ""Little Dorrit"" or ""David Copperfield"" instead; maybe even a different rendition of the story.

Most if not all of us have ready this novel at one time or another and this movie will bring back the memories if you don't remember it.

I was absolutely amazed at how they were able to bring this book to life, it is simply a masterpiece, with wonderful actors and actresses doing an excellent job portraying all of the characters. Helena Bonham Carter was superb as always! I loved the fact that they stayed true to the novel as most movies based off of books will have their on spin on them.

The detail to the time period itself shows very well in the locations and costumes. As I was watching the movie, I was remembering all of the parts in the book relating to the scene.

5407961,4,B00AAXZ75K,"I considered fewer stars, but this is a very worthy production on it's own.  See comparisons to other recent versions ***with links*** near the bottom of this review.

This adaptation is chock full of well known actors and wonderful performances.  The production values are outstanding and the setting is true period (not a re-imagining).  In fact, this edition may become some peoples' favorite version.  However, I felt it lacked that final spark to make it a true classic.  I suggest a rental first and try other recent adaptations below.

FIRST THE EXCELLENT.  The actor playing Pip is terrific and I am glad they didn't simply try to find the most famous name they could cast.  This is a reasonably faithful adaptation for purists and that may sway you to this production over others.  Much original dialog is used, yet a more natural voice of cinematic acting is employed rather than a melodramatic stage acting style. Still, very Dickensian though. Jason Flemyng, as the blacksmith that raises Pip, proves he is more than just a role player and I felt he was truly outstanding and sympathetic.  This version as a whole was really fantastic at portraying the mood of Pip's transformation, his embarrassment with his previous life and friends, as well as his realization/reconciliation later.  I also really liked that this version deftly defines the very moment where Pip charms Ms. Havisham as a boy, and unknowingly saves himself from a fate reserved for another, meaner gentleman.

NOW THE LESS GOOD.  The movie had so many elements that could make it a true classic.  However, it fails to flesh out Ms. Havisham and Estella.  The movie feels long, yet still too short to make you care about characters necessary to draw the viewer in.  I LOVE Helena Bonham Carter, but she carries so much Tim Burton movie baggage into this production that it's a little distracting.  Her performance is cartoonish (though not as over the top as usual).  She seems more goofy than insane or calculatingly vicious.  One doesn't feel the real madness and mystery in Ms. Havisham.  She seems like such an obvious choice, yet I didn't see the gravitas in her interpretation.  The child Estella is appropriately cold, but so irritating that one just can't believe Pip would ever love her.  Charm does not accompany the coldness.  I don't feel the director ever gave Holliday Grainger the opportunity to redeem or humanize the character later in the movie.  Holliday is one of my favorite new actresses, but I also feel she is not necessarily right for Estella.  She is too sweet faced perhaps.  Her demeanor is cold, but her face projects girlish beauty, not cold, hard, calculating beauty. Jaggers the lawyer is more jolly than austere.  Fiennes as Megwich has a believably rough accent, but is much too fine a figure to believe as a brute convict.  He is not really that menacing.

TRY THESE ALTERNATIVES:

The 2011 miniseries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Classic-Great-Expectations/dp/B0077PBPV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Classic: Great Expectations</a>&nbsp;is perhaps the best recent adaptation.  This is the TV miniseries with Gillian Anderson (yes, she shocked me too!)  Gillian stuns with an amazingly mysterious, almost creepy Ms. Havisham that conveys the madness and even a bit of otherworldly beauty.  Her portrayal is a little more exaggerated, yet I felt appropriate and intriguing. The extended miniseries format allows for the development needed and never grows tiresome.  Truly, with this excellent version out, I don't know why they felt the need for the movie production just one year later (2012 in the UK rather than 2014 you see on the US release).

1999 version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Expectations/dp/B0002XVRGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Expectations</a>&nbsp;with Justine Waddell and Charlotte Rampling.  This is probably my favorite because I am partial to Justine's portrayal of Estella.  She is absolutely cold and distant, yet so stunningly beautiful and charming that one cannot help but love her.  As the viewer, I was compelled to feel as Pip did.  Rampling goes a little more vicious and calculating route, which is also valid for Havisham.  Gruffud is an excellent Pip and I liked him as Horatio Hornblower so I liked it at the time.  In retrospect, I would still place the two latter Pips above his performance.

1998 version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Expectations/dp/B000SW2ESG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Expectations</a>&nbsp;with Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow.  A little more re-imagining with this one.  But, it is perhaps the most atmospheric and compelling of the versions.  Purists may not like this one, but I found it very beautiful and entertaining.  This one is a bit more sexy too!

5407962,5,B00AAXZ75K,"Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Donnie Brasco, Harry Potter, Love n the Time of Cholera, Mona Lisa Smile, Enchanted April, etc) joins with creative screenwriter David Nicholls (When Did You Last See Your Father?, One Day, Starter for 10, Tess of the D'Urbervilles) and a cast and crew of enormous talent and delivers what in this viewer's opinion is the finest version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS on film. Few explorations of this complicated, dense novel by Charles Dickens manage to make every character wholly credible - no absolute villains or absolute heroes here, just a range of behavior throughout the spectrum that makes every character beautifully defined, making the intricate story wholly comprehensible.

The story is soften told that the plot is well known - though never as fully realized as in this beautifully photographed (John Mathieson) and scored (Richard Hartley) version. Pip as a lad (Toby Irvine, Jeremy Irvine's younger brother) is terrified by an encounter with escaped convict Magwitch (Ralph Fiennes) and befriends him - a significant moment in the story. The young orphan Pip is kept by blacksmith Joe Gargery (Jason Flemyng) and his horrid wife (Sally Hawkins) until he is engaged by the strange Miss Havisham (Helena Bonham Carter) in her strangely creepy house to play with her `daughter' Estella (Helena Barlow).  In rather rapid sequence the adult Pip (now Jeremy Irvine) inherits a fortune from an anonymous benefactor, his future seems promising. Estella (now Holliday Grainger) seems bent on a different life than one with the obviously infatuated Pip. Pip is off to London, becomes a wealthy gentleman, still pines for Estella, is supervised by Jaggers (Robbie Coltrane) until a series of secrets surface and the story proceeds to its complex conclusion.

The vast cast is populated with some of England's finest actors and they all give sterling performances. The costumes and locations and settings are splendid. And for once the complex Dickens' story makes complete sense. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, April 14",1397952000,10,2069,5.263636363636364
5407963,4,B00AAXZ75K,"Thematically speaking, Mike Newell's GREAT EXPECTATIONS depicts a world in which money talks: where rich n'er-do-wells such as Bentley Drummle (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) manage to find the girls of their choice, while fundamentally good people such as Pip (Toby/ Jeremy Irvine) end up unlucky.  To survive in this world, Pip has to shed his humanity; this is especially evident in his offhand treatment of Joe Gargery (Jason Flemyng), when the blacksmith comes to visit him in London.  Likewise Estella (Helena Barlow/ Holliday Granger) is brought up in a world where any display of emotion or human feeling is considered weak; hence she believes it is her destiny to marry Bentley, even though the couple are not in love with one another.  The quintessential representative of this rapacious world is Jaggers (Robbie Coltrane), who believes that everything - including human beings - are to be bought and sold for money.  Hence Joe Gargery should be happy to accept twenty-five guineas in exchange for Pip.  Unless you've got money, you'll not have any Great Expectations.  Newell's film is also very good at depicting the relationships between Pip, Estella and Miss Havisham (Helena Bonham Carter) - although somewhat young for the role, Bonham Carter comes across as a fundamentally vindictive person, who enjoys playing with Estella and Pip's feelings in revenge for her own frustrations at being jilted on her wedding-day several years previously.  As with most BBC-inspired costume dramas, the sense of place is beautifully evoked, even though Jim Clay's production designs; nineteenth-century London is a teeming, threatening world in which self-interest prevails.  This is contrasted with the rural Kent coast where Joe and his sister (Sally Hawkins), a lonely world of sprawling landscapes and russet sunsets. Perhaps the only criticism that might be leveled at this adaptation is the fact that David Nicholls' screenplay runs out of steam somewhat: the plot-details are rather hurriedly wrapped up in the last half-hour at the expense of characterization and atmosphere.  This is a shame, as it deflects out attention from the developing relationship between Pip and Abel Magwitch (Ralph Fiennes), which proves beyond doubt that compassion is far more significant than money to ensure human survival.",1393545600,,2302,5.354570637119114

5407966,4,B00AAXZ75K,"As any filmmaker would admit, Dickens is tricky to adapt. The serial nature and sheer complexity of most of his works demand both a firm grasp of plot delineation and a longer running time; hence, the number of well-executed TV mini-series based on Dickens' novels. Mike Newell, following in the revered but faded footsteps of David Lean, attempts to resurrect Great Expectations for the silver screen; the result is a flawed but very faithful rendering which moves from plot-point to plot-point in short scenes pared to the minimum of necessary dialogue. The film runs for two hours, but as Peter Jackson proved, audiences can handle three hours of great British literature and Great Expectations would benefit from more time. The escalating speed with which the plot moves and its complete lack of transitional story material makes the production feel like Cliff-Notes Dickens, albeit beautifully filmed and very well acted Cliff-Notes.

The story follows the life of Philip Pirrip (known as Pip): a chance encounter with an escaped convict (Ralph Fiennes) in the marshes will have a profound effect on his future, though he doesn't know it. Not long after, Pip meets the mysterious Miss Havisham and her proud, beautiful ward, Estella. Pip's relationship with Estella is broken off, however, when he is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, the village blacksmith. Some years later, a lawyer arrives to inform Pip that he has come into a large inheritance (hence, the ""great expectations"" of the title). Pip's actions in his pursuit of gentility lead him down a slippery slope into dissipation and snobbery, and when he again encounters Estella and the convict, he learns that money and fine clothes do not make one a gentleman, and that happiness is not to be found in a self-centered life.

Too often Pip is portrayed as a wide-eyed innocent, but as played by Toby and Jeremy Irvine (both of them excellent), he is an ambitious young man carrying loads of angst and fully culpable for his actions. Holliday Grainger, though icily beautiful, isn't given enough screen time to develop Estella's imperious and forceful personality, but when she's on screen, she's spot on. Irvine and Grainger are bolstered by a stellar supporting cast (Robbie Coltrane, Helena Bonham-Carter, Jason Flemying, and Ralph Fiennes), all of whom deliver restrained and subtle performances. Bonham-Carter is a real stand-out: her portrayal of Miss Havisham is at once imperious, slightly mad, and subtly pathetic. Coltrane carries off the oily self-righteousness of a man who knows he's done wrong, but justifies it with professional excuses. And Flemyng adds the gravitas of a completely uncynical, uncomplicated country blacksmith.

Promoted by the cast and filmmakers as a thriller of sorts, this adaptation has a darkly gothic, stylized beauty which comes across in the costumes, sets, lighting and cinematography. Newell's decision to make the marshes a sunny place contrasts with the gloom of Satis House and the griminess of London: from the very beginning, the viewer is informed that Pip really is better off right where he started.

Though this adaptation would benefit from more time and better dramatic pacing, it holds together with top-notch performances and touches of humor amidst the darkness of the story.",1385424000,2,3312,5.219924812030075
5407967,5,B00AAXZ75K,"As someone who loves Charles Dickens and the work of director Mike Newell, I have been eagerly anticipating this film since its release in England last fall. I was fortunate enough to attend its Arizona premiere at the Scottsdale International Film Festival on October 7th, and I have to say that all my anticipation was well justified. It is more than just a good film or a faithful adaptation of one of the 19th century's greatest novels; it is a masterpiece.

I can't understand why so many reviews, both from critics and the public alike, are so negative. It is a good watch whether you've read the novel or not. Literary purists will enjoy it for the fact that it stays so close to the book, and casual film buffs will appreciate that the twisting Dickensian plot is made comprehensible enough so that they can follow along as well. Having watched other adaptations including the much-lauded 1946 Lean film version, which was, incidentally, the last time this story made it to the silver screen, others pale in comparison. There is not a thing about it that I would change or want any different. It is probably the best film I've seen all year.

Hats off to screenwriter David Nicholls, who manages to successfully translate a 450+ page novel into the perfect 2-hour film. He kept it to just the right length--long enough to avoid feeling butchered, but short enough so that things weren't dragged out longer than necessary. The pacing was good, and I never felt like something had been ""cut out"", a rare feeling in a production like this. The preservation of Dickens' own dialogue and his occasional touches of humor lends an authenticity rarely felt in adaptations of his work (ref. BBC's disastrous 3-hour miniseries).

The visual look of the film is lush and gorgeous, with evocative landscapes of the Kentish coast and Gothic interiors looking equally appropriate. The choice of costumes is intriguing-a stylistic mash-up of 19th century with a psudo-theatrical flair. While I found some of the hairstyle choices, particularly those of Estella's, slightly out of place with the time period, overall, it works in this film.

What I found as the most pleasant surprise was how well acted this film was. The trap that so many actors fall into of allowing over-the-top theatricality and quirkiness overpower the fact that Dickens intended his characters to come off as real people has been avoided. The entire cast is ideally suited to their respective parts, and give real, moving performances. Unlike other Dickens adaptations,  Jeremy Irvine and Holliday Grainger as the older Pip and Estella gave better performances than I expected from the trailer, and look out for Toby Irvine, Jeremy's real-life younger brother, as Young Pip--he's a scene-stealer! Helena Bonham Carter simply is Miss Havisham, and plays her as she should be played, slightly dotty, but with a reason for her madness. Robbie Coltrane is excellent as the less-than-trustworthy Jaggers, and Jason Flemyng as Joe is literally an exact replica of the character as I imagined while reading the novel. The real standout, though, is Ralph Fiennes as Magwitch. His beautiful eyes carry the character to perfection, and along with a believable but intelligible North Country accent, it's hard to imagine anyone but him in the role.

To sum up, Mike Newell's ""Great Expectations"" is unquestionably one of the best Dickens adaptations ever made, certainly the best of feature-length, and I recommend it to anyone.",1385164800,24,3483,5.017301038062284

Granted, I haven't read all of them, but I doubt that any will ever top it. What strikes me the most is its originality, for this is a book that does backflips through the usual narrative tropes and is filled with original characters and ideas: the mysterious benefactor, the embittered old woman who raises a child to be her revenge on men, a gender-flipped Cinderella who realizes he was better off a blacksmith, and a fascinating, captivating, tragic ice princess of a love interest.

Mike Newell's take on the source material is pretty good, particularly coming so close on the heels of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2011-miniseries/dp/B007TMI1NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2011 miniseries</a>&nbsp;starring Gillian Anderson and Ray Winstone. In much less time to spare, it still manages to tell the complete story in a way that doesn't feel (too) cluttered or rushed. The most interesting difference between the two adaptations is that the film keeps Biddy but drops Orlick, whereas the miniseries kept Orlick but dropped Biddy. I've long-since believed that any take on ""Great Expectations"" will focus either on Magwitch or Miss Havisham, thereby emphasizing either the mystery or the romance of the story. Without Biddy, the miniseries focused more on the action and danger of Magwitch. And without Orlick, this film focuses much more on the heartache and intrigue that Miss Havisham provides.

And sure enough, the Miss Havisham and Estella of the miniseries (Gillian Anderson and Vanessa Kirby) come across as meek and fragile; whereas in the film (Helena Bonham Carter and Holliday Grainger) they are far more potent. On the other hand, the Magwitch of the film (Ralph Fiennes) is rather lacklustre, whilst in the miniseries  (with Ray Winstone) it's as though Pip has let a dangerous and unpredictable creature into the house, one that poses just as much a threat to him as to anyone else.

It was only a matter of time before Helena Bonham Carter played the part of Miss Havisham, and she (ironically) reins in her usual eccentricity in order to play the part with a surprising amount of restraint.  Whereas Gillian Anderson before her played Havisham as childlike and ghostly, Helena comes across as more shrewd and self-aware, getting visibly agitated only a few times in public. Despite the stopped clocks and the rotting bridal veil and the hollowed-out wedding cake that still sits among the remains of the banquet in the dining hall, this Havisham still has all her facilities and is canny enough to read the emotions of those around her.

Out of the entire cast, I was most interested in seeing Holliday Grainger in the role of Estella, for this is one of my favourite literary characters. In many ways, I wish the novel had been about her, for there's just something captivating about the portrayal of a child who is raised in such melancholy surroundings, by such a twisted mind, for such a specific purpose. And how when reaches adulthood, she's actually self-aware enough to comprehend what's been done to her, to confront the woman that designed her so calculatingly, and yet be unable to break free of the principles that shaped her. Holliday manages to capture the inherent tragedy of Estella. She's suitably coltish and beguiling, and though they don't give her particularly flattering hairstyles, I loved the stylistic choice of dressing her in varying shades of purple. Like her name suggests, she comes across as the cold, unattainable, unreachable star of men's fantasies.

Personally I didn't think Ralph Fiennes was a particularly imposing Magwitch. Not only is the film far more interested in Estella and Miss Havisham anyway, but Fiennes doesn't really capture the brutality and danger that Magwitch is meant to embody. Magwitch should always be threatening and unpredictable, like a barely restrained dog, thus providing contrast in his adoring treatment of Pip. Sadly, there's simply not enough time to provide the proper setup or payoff for their relationship; the limited run-time means that the film can only tick the plot points instead of plumbing the depths of its themes. Towards the end there are several scenes of exposition that explain the backstory in murky flashback sequences, but it's not done particularly elegantly, and - as in all of Dickens' novels - the sheer amount of contrived coincidences at work is a bit of a stretch.

I've also noticed in the past that sometimes Dickens' protagonists can sit uneasily alongside his supporting cast, many of which easily become caricatures if not handled properly. There's always the risk that they'll be too comic, or the heroes too dour, leading to a strange sort of imbalance in the tone. In this case, it's handled well. Jeremy Irvine is fine as Pip (though to me there should be a purity and a dreaminess to Pip that's not quite conveyed) and the more colourful characters don't threaten to upstage him or upset the grounding in reality. Even David Wallace as Pumblechook is kept under control, and Olly Alexander, who I've never seen in anything previously, is fantastic as Herbert Pocket - quite possibly my favourite take on the character.

Any adaptation worth its runtime has to be heavy on atmosphere, and Newell captures the misty emptiness of the Kent marshes, the decaying ruins of Statis House, and the bustle and claustrophobia of London. It's a feast for the eyes, as any version of this particular story should be. Likewise, there are plenty of nice little details from the book strewn throughout: Joe and Mrs Gargery sleeping head-to-toe in bed, young Estella dancing on the barrel-tops, Wemmick and his cannon, and the riotous nature of the Finches, complete with foppish makeup and glass smashing.

Still, it's a good take on the source material, which (despite the missing Orlick) manages to pull together all the disparate threads of the novel and weave them together into a relatively cohesive whole. It's heavy on atmosphere, and though I would have like a bit more time to explore some of the book's depths, it does manage to depict the two key concepts that sum up the entirety of Great Expectations: regret and hope.",1383868800,,6379,5.226783968719452
8549459,3,B00AAXZ75K,"Charles Dickens' novels have been popular for film, stage and television adaptations. This 2014 film is done exceptionally well with a strong focus on Pip and his life. The cast is first rate with Helena Bonham Carter as the unforgettable Mrs. Havisham in her aging wedding dress. Holliday Grainger was cast as Estella, Pip's love. The story of Pip who began as a country orphan to a wealthy gentleman ask several questions about the purpose of life. Charles Dickens' always asked thought provoking questions about existence during his time.

This film is about two hours long which is more than suitable for any film. The cast do a first rate job in their performances. Other supporting players were Ralph Fiennes and Robbie Coltrane. The art direction, costumes and make-up are also first rate. The film sets a depressing mood about the times. There is only one extra about the New York City premiere with the producers' comments. I would have liked to have seen more such as the making of the film and why this novel always gets adapted every few years in some medium.",1529971200,,1071,4.789189189189189
