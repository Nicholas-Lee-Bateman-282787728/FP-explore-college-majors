2604803,5,B000GDH8HE,"I'm a big fan of Sci Fi's Ghost Hunters.  One of the best reality shows hands down.  I originally bought Season 2, Part 2 at my local Best Buy.  After hearing the noticeably loud, grainy, distorted sound I returned it thinking it was a defect in the DVDs.  After purchasing both parts from Amazon I was disappointed to discover that this was also on both sets and ALL DVD's of this series.  I was very surprised to see that final cut of this series to make it with poor quality in sound.",1159228800,5,487,4.25
2604804,3,B000GDH8HE,"Ghost Hunters is great TV, and the second season has plenty of great moments.

My disappointment lies in the audio department...it's simply flawed to the point of ruining the experience.  The fuzzed-out sound is either extremely low quality, or simply a huge error on the manufacturer's part somehow.  I am just not sure.  All of my discs in both season parts are like this.

I am not sure if it is just my copies, or a first batch issue, or what.

The video quality is also quite poor, simply very low resolution many times, and they did a poor job of ""lightening up"" evidence films in the show, so that viewers can actually see what they are seeing more clearly.  The St. Augustine Lighthouse evidence reveal comes to mind, as does the experience Jason has in the Stanley Hotel when the door closes in his room.

Not nearly enough effort and quality production values were put into this season.  It's honestly bad enough, for someone who is not overly picky about DVD perfection, to want to return or exchange my copies.

I'm not sure what sort of huge mistake was made in producing these, but, I hope it is addressed and those that bought early, defective copies, are reimbursed or allowed to exchange.

All that said, it is ""watchable"" in it's current form, and the show itself, of course, is excellent.  If you believe in ghosts or not, or the paranormal at large, this show is entertaining, as it focuses strictly on producing sound evidence (audio/visual) versus relying on the thoughts and feeling of others (psychics).

No psychics are used! Thank God.

I truly hope they do something about the horrible audio and visual quality of these DVD's.  I cannot be the only one with this experience.",1159228800,5,1701,4.68013468013468
2604805,3,B000GDH8HE,"I'll be blunt - I love the series but the DVD Seasons 2, Part 1 and part 2 have a grainy video quality about them and the sound is just so horrible I was having a hard time comprehending some of the investigators. This is a major disappointment. Why should fans have to settle with poorly translated DVD's?

Re-release something that is above VHS/Beta quality.",1159228800,,360,4.538461538461538
2604806,4,B000GDH8HE,"They're back to fight the evil. They will never decieve you. They're Back! A new take on an old favorite from Ghostbusters II. I just thought it would be fun. Anyway, it looks like our favorite poltergiest pulverising plumbers are finally releasing their second season! This is part one of two and each set is comprised of four disks. Infact $[...] aint a bad price for these sets. Season 1 was three disks and it cost the same price. These disks contain some of the best episodes so far. The folks at SciFi and Big Vision have answered our call so grab your EMF detector, sit back, and enjoy. (Update 12/30/07) First of all I made three mistakes in the above review, two of which have been removed and one fixed. I messed up on the lyrics to ""We're Back"" from Ghostbusters II so they are fixed now and I also wanted to correct myself on a couple of things. 1. This is not seasons 2 and 3 but is infact only season 2 and 2. The Halloween episode from season 2 is available on the Very Best Of Vol. 2 DVD. Just wanted to clear things up here. Also I have my replacement copy as well and mine is in excellent condition. Although I have to agree about the video and audio quality of the disks, it could be better, but at least it's better than it was the first time.",1152921600,7,1263,4.223140495867769

2604830,5,B000GDH8HE,"I made a trip with my mom to an amazing hotel in Eureka Springs back in 2006. We went on a great ghost tour they had and they told us all about this group that had filmed a tv show there. I hadn't heard of Ghost Hunters until this trip, and as soon as we got home I quickly looked into what they were all about. I can say I am a huge fan now. I have followed the series for years and have visited a number of the same sites they have. I have never been disappointed either.  I purchased this set because it had the episode on it that they filmed at the hotel my mom and I stayed at.  It was awesome!!

2604909,4,B000GDH8HE,"Ok, I have to admit some bias to this particular dvd set of Ghost Hunters.  Mainly because the first episode was filmed in my home town, at the Mansfield Reformatory.  It's a creepy, wonderful place (as evidenced by movies being filmed there) and I've actually been there several times.  They do a Haunted House Tour every year, and one year I was a volunteer for it.  My job was to sit at the top of the stairs leading to Solitary (by myself) and make sure when the tours went through they didn't fall down the stairs.  Unlike TAPS though, I didn't have any paranormal experiences.  Regardless, it was fantastic to see it featured on the show.

TAPS is The Atlantic Paranormal Society.  They investigate hauntings, setting out with equipment to prove or disprove hauntings in places.  What makes them different is that they primarily disprove Hauntings, so when they do find something, it's more meaningful.  They use a variety of equipment, including EMF detectors, temperature gauges, video and audio recordings.  These are used in hope of having concrete evidence of a haunting, rather than just personal experiences.

The group was created by Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson after they both had experiences they couldn't explain.  Joining them are several investigators, with Steve the Tech Manager, Brian the Investigator, Donna the Case Manager, and Dave the Investigator in Training being the most notable.  Because there is such a variety of people, there's always a lot of drama going on.  Especially when Brian is involved, as he seems to cause a lot of stress and strife within the group.  I find this kind of distracting actually, and hate that the show has to include it, even if does help improve ratings (it is a reality show afterall).  I also prefer when they stick to the main investigators, and am not too fond when they have a parade of different people go through as it makes it hard to judge each person's integrity in regards to investigations.

This 2nd part of Season 2 has some great locations that they film at.  There's the Mansfield Reformatory, as I already mentioned.  The Lizzie Borden House, Crescent Hotel, Waverly Hills Sanatorium, Paladium Theatre, Valentown Museum, Willard Library, Hartford Conservatory, St. Augustine Lighthouse (very exciting episode), Domani's Restaurant, St. Augustine Jail, Stone Line Inn, private residences, and most notably of all, the Stanley Hotel.  Which was another fantastic episode.

Because this is a show that very much relies on quality sound and visuals, it's hard to see some things from their footage sometimes.  This improves in later seasons when they get better equipment, but even with what they have, they are still able to present some great evidence.  But, it is disappointing when you're straining to see the evidence, and it just isn't that clear.  Another distracting aspect is the background noise while on investigations.  There are sound effects and music playing so you can't always hear what the investigators are hearing.

I love this show and think that they offer up some unusual things to the viewer.  There's a reason it's survived through several seasons and it's because of the unique way they approach ""ghost hunting.""

Review by M. Reynard 2013",1380326400,,3241,5.005607476635514
2604910,4,B000GDH8HE,"With the exception of the first season, from here on out, Ghost Hunters Seasons are separated into two parts.  Probably just to give you a more impressive looking collection on your shelf, at least that's the reason I'm going to go with.  So this review is for the First Part of Season 1.

For those not familiar with Ghost Hunters, it revolves around a paranormal investigative society called The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS).  Founders Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson are investigators, who along with their team, go to different locations and try to disprove hauntings.  That's right, disprove.  They don't immediately believe anything and try to rule out explainable possibilities for the phenomena they do find.  And that's what makes them different and explains their success as a TV show.

The people are what make the show.  If you didn't believe in their credibility, there'd be no reason to watch it.  And Jason and Grant come across as being very truthful and believable.  You know they don't want to make a fool out of you with fake evidence.  Or so it seems that way.  In fact, as the season progresses, they kind of filter out the people who are not so professional and move to having people that are calm, collected, and present the group well.  This includes the removal of Brian Harnois about half way through the discs, who not only caused drama,  but didn't appear to be very professional either.  Steve Gonsalves, as his replacement, still has fun, but gets the job done.  And this season introduces us to Dave Tango, an investigator I really enjoy because of energy.  I was still a little disappointed to see the demonologists in this one.  I think they just lose a little bit of their credibility when they bring them in; especially when all we see them do is bless houses and not actual find any real proof that a non-human entity is haunting a place.  But even their appearances were rare.

The equipment they use is specialized for what they want to find.  They run a lot of different kinds of video, record audio to see if there is voice phenomena, have heat sensors and temperature guns, and EMF detectors to detect high energy fields whether it be emitting from an electronic or something unexplainable.  All this is in an attempt to find evidence that's provable, and sometimes they catch some pretty interesting stuff with it.  I honestly don't care one way or the other for the EMF's and temperature guns, they don't add anything for me.  But the video and audio, when they do have something to show, is quite impressive.  And because it seems they have a little more funds this time around, the picture quality was noticeably better (although still not fantastic) and the sound seemed less fuzzy.  I think this better presents their evidence and makes viewing it at home not as much of a chore to see what they're seeing.  They still had the distracting music though.

TAPS went to a lot of famous places in this first part of the season and I was impressed that they didn't automatically assume that a place was haunted.  In fact, at a lot of these places, they didn't find anything.  And they admitted it.  They also disproved a lot of evidence they caught that appeared to be a haunting in the first place, but was actually done by a tricky live person.  The fact that they are so upfront is another thing that makes this show so believable.  And aside from these famous places that they went (Myrtles Plantation, Brennan's Restaurant, Mordecai House, USS North Carolina, Bradley Playhouse, Harris Firehouse, Ledge Lighthouse, Astor's Newport Mansion, Rolling Hills Asylum, Eastern State Penitentiary, Winchester House, and Queen Mary) they also went to quite a few private residences, where in my opinion, they get the best evidence.  My favorite episode was probably the Rolling Hills Asylum.  I won't say whether or not they caught any evidence, but it was an interesting place and the team really acted as a unit during it.  By contrast, the first couple of episodes were a little haphazard because of their crew.

I think that as the drama lessened and the people improved, this is where Ghost Hunters starts to really be a great show.  Even for people who don't believe in ghosts, they present interesting evidence or something strange happening.  I recommend starting at this season instead of the first, unless you really want all the background stuff that happens with TAPS.

I should have went shopping, at least I could have gotten a quick exchange or my money back. It's not worth the $ to ship back and wait to see if I get screwed two times in a row. Both vol 1 and vol 2 have so many scratches and skips it's hard to believe these are their NEW ones and not their USED. It looks like a child had them in a sand box and rubbed etchings all over them. One disc even has hard circles dug into it and it freezes up and skips a whole section of the investigation. To say the least, I will be a bit pickier of whom I choose to do business with.

2604920,4,B000GDH8HE,"This is a great series, if you are a fan of ghost hunting this is probably the best show out there.

So, of course, I had to pick up this first part of the Second Season.  Boy, am I happy I did.  Some of places they visit are well know and very famous.  Such as Winchester House and the Queen Mary.  And the U.S.S. North Carolina which is one of the most haunted ships there is.
Sometimes they get something and sometimes not.  There is still a tad too much drama for me, but there is also humor and some amazing investigations. I was VERY interested in the episode where they visited the Myrtles Plantation as I have heard mixed reports about that haunting.  Over all a very good DVD set, worth the money.  I also hear that later seasons they drop a lot of the drama and focus on the ghost hunting, which makes me lean towards buying more of the sets.

2604927,1,B000GDH8HE,"When I was young, I used to believe in this sort of thing out of naivete; I just couldn't believe that every ghost sighting in history was a mistake or hoax. Time has made me a bit more cynical though, and education has increased my understanding of science sufficiently to let me see TAPS (or GHI as they now call themselves) for what they really are; grown up children playing make-believe at science. The Ghost Hunters all bill themselves as clear-thinking, open minded skeptics who go into hauntings with the intent of *debunking* paranormal claims. The few bits of evidence surviving their intellectual assault are viewed as the true grains of wheat cleanly filtered from the chaff. In practice, though, they assume that the most mundane happenings are the result of invisible boogeymen. When they inevitably fail to prove any of the literally infinite numbers of non-boogeyman explanations beyond the phantasm of a doubt, our Ghost Hunters surrender and revert to their default position on any given event they don't understand; ""A boogeyman did it!""

In the early part of the series they would often conclude investigations with banal discussions about how, although the house was obviously filled with dead peoples' ghosts, it's still iffy whether or not to call it haunted. The *word* haunting was all but poo-pooed, despite the hosts' obsessive interest in the *concept* of hauntings. Where wondering how many grains of sand it takes to make a heap is the province of philosophers one might think the Ghost Hunters to be eminently qualified to answer how many ghosts have to ""live"" in a home before its haunted. However they seem to have little interest in actually answering that question, as answered questions just represent one less nook for their ghost-of-the-gaps to haunt. Don't be suckered in, these paranormal programs aren't intelligent good faith investigations into learning about the world; they are vapid mystery mongering, every last one of them. Interestingly even the pitiful level of faux, imitation skepticism expressed in constant dishonest claims about wanting to debunk hauntings seems to have drained away through-out the seasons. So too with the dismissive semantic quibbling about calling paranormal sites haunted. It looks like SyFy doesn't want its drooling viewership to engage in even the weakest level of critical reflection pertaining to what's appearing on their TV screen. That or the Ghost Hunters team have given up even the pretense of trying to look like dispassionate amateur scientists.

Ghost Hunters use scientific instruments in ways that boggle the mind. In their hands thermometers, electromagnetic field detectors, and others all gain the ability to detect ""ghosts."" These spirits suspiciously resemble cold breezes or electromagnetic fields. How are these in any sense ghosts? Jason Hawes is always on hand to give a canned ten second speech about how ghosts draw ""energy"" from the environment in order to manifest themselves as house settling noises or invisible fingers touching a female crew member's hair. Interestingly all these female members happen to be suspiciously attractive. Maybe there's something attractive women find irresistible about a plumber walking through old houses at 3 in the morning with a thermometer, but it strains my skepticism muscles to think that all these beautiful women were chosen based on their credentials. Anyway, Hawes never bothers to detail his ""energy"" hypothesis any more than just stating it forthrightly. What kind of energy? Kinetic? Thermal? X-ray? The answer, it seems, is any energy involved in an event Hawes doesn't currently understand and has no interest in subjecting to sustained scrutiny. Which is pretty much every event that happens during an investigation.

The show is a litany of filler and repetitive, boring non-content. The gang gets a call and they travel to the location while talking about how they're not True Believers, they just want to debunk the claims and see what remains unexplained. The client gives them a tour of the investigation site after they arrive. Then they start setting up equipment. However, since they have no detailed, coherent concept of what a ghost is or how one might confirm its existence in a legitimately verifiable, repeatable manner, the Ghost Hunters have a resulting lack of detailed, coherent methodology for actually doing so. This renders the entire investigation pointless, and any conclusions or purported evidence worthless. What is all that evidence actually *for*, what theory do they propose for all of these happenings? Anyway, the plumbers-by-day then mill about filming and temperature-taking and interviewing the furniture hoping a ghost will silently speak to their electronic voice recorders.

During the night they'll have one or two spooky experiences where a shadow moves by or they hear the wind but it sounds like a voice, or maybe they feel an invisible person brush up against them and cop a feel. That these guys have mysterious, eerie experiences during the course of an investigation is no really a surprise to this skeptic. What could one expect when a bunch of superstitious, under-educated people whose entire lives revolve around wanting to have ghostly encounters hype themselves up with expectations of having one and then start wandering through stereotypical haunted houses at 3 AM in a sleep deprived state? So, once day breaks they leave. Then they watch dozens of hours of video looking for anomalies. About half of these anomalies are dismissed out of hand as obvious moths or reflections. The team then present their ""wheat"" harvest to the client, who they then patronizingly reassure that they don't have to be afraid of living in their own home. The client always agrees, and they conclude yammering about whether or not the place was technically haunted or not. Every episode is the same. The only variation is how much evidence (sensu lato) accumulates during a given episode. Oftentimes they find absolutely nothing, and will have to reassure the homeowner that although intense monitoring by world-class Ghost Hunters produced no sign of a ghost in the house, their house is still full of ghosts. So really, the conclusion is always the same. If the Ghost Hunters find something, the house is full of ghosts. If the Ghost Hunters don't find anything, then, the house is still full of ghosts. Of course, in either case, the house-full-of-ghosts is not necessarily ""haunted,"" per se...

PS: There's also strong reason to believe that the Ghost Hunters actually fake some of their ""evidence."" For example, in one episode a lamp was shown sliding towards Grant on a table. In the shot before the lamp moved, its cord faced directly backwards. But in the shot after the lamp moved towards Grant, the cord was seen facing his direction. And to top it all off the table cloth in the moving lamp footage was visibly different than the table cloth on that same table when the Ghost Hunters were receiving their episodely tour of the site. There are dozens of such examples in the series and plenty of relevant information online.",1293148800,,7123,5.147668393782383

2604933,2,B000GDH8HE,"I stumbled across the DVD set of the second season of this show while browsing the videos at my local library. I had never heard of Ghost Hunters before. From the box I thought it looked silly and I don't like ""reality shows"" in general, but I decided to borrow it when I saw the Winchester Mansion listed on the back as being one of the locations they visit. I've been fascinated with that house ever since I saw a segment about it on a TV show in the early 80s called That's Incredible.

At first I was skeptical of Ghost Hunters. Then after a few episodes I started to ask myself if, despite the obvious scripting of some of the scenes, the show wasn't basically honest as far as the paranormal stuff was concerned; after all, I reasoned, if the show is fake, why wouldn't they make it more exciting? If they were faking it, would half the shows be duds where nothing paranormal happens? Besides, I thought, none of these people seem like professional actors, so they must be legitimate investigators. Now, however, after having watched all the shows in the second season and done a few hours of research on the web, I've come full circle. There's not a doubt in my mind that the whole thing is BS.

Because the ""evidence"" that they show would be so easy to fake (either during taping or afterwards in post-production), whether or not you believe that the supposed paranormal activity shown is genuine depends entirely on how much you're willing to trust the personalities on the show, namely Jason, Grant, Steve, and the others who sometimes join them. But just how trustworthy are these people? Should we trust them more than we would anyone or anything else on TV?

The show puts a lot of effort into creating an image of Jason and Grant as humble, ordinary, down-to-earth blue collar workers and family men. You really want to buy into that image and believe that these seemingly likable guys wouldn't lie to their audience. But just how accurate is this image? Are we expected to believe that after creating a hit TV series, getting book and merchandising contracts, and charging fans tidy sums of money for lectures and workshops, which seem to take place often, these guys haven't quit their day jobs as plumbers? Are we supposed to believe that these guys don't receive any money from ""Roto-Rooter"" for plugging its services on every episode? TAPS certifies local ghost hunting groups as being a part of their ""Family"" -- do Jason and Grant make money from this, as with the franchises of a fast food chain, or a pyramid scheme?

Jason and Grant are portrayed on the show as being hard-headed but open-minded skeptics. According to their latest book, Seeking Spirits, of which I read an excerpt here on Amazon, Grant's first paranormal experience was when as a teenager, he and a friend spent two years (!) interacting on an almost daily basis with a ghostlike entity in the woods. So let me get this straight -- if Grant spent two years interacting with a ghost, which he could even, apparently, set up appointments with to meet it in town (!), why does he pretend to be a skeptic on the show? Why would he even bother with EMF meters and digital thermometers, which don't prove anything anyways, knowing not only that ghosts exist, but having had an extensive relationship with one? Does that make any sense? No, it doesn't. In the lingo of the television industry, that's what's called a continuity error, or an actor falling out of character.

In the book, Grant also tells us that Jason's first paranormal experience was when he started seeing ghosts everywhere about six months after he started receiving Reiki treatments (which seems to somewhat contradict Jason's earlier claim to a medium in episode 213 that his first ghostly encounters were with dead relatives coming to visit him). Reiki is ""a system of hands-on touching based on the belief that such touching by an experienced practitioner produces beneficial effects by strengthening and normalizing certain vital energy fields held to exist within the body"" -- hmm, was Jason some kind of a New Age flake? That hardly sounds like the skeptical, down-to-earth Jason we see on the show, now does it? Reading such passages in their books, I can't help but feel that they're urinating in their fans' faces and telling them that it's raining.

There are other things that don't add up, like the story of how Grant supposedly quit his job as a ""systems administrator for a major manufacturing company"" to work as a plumber with Jason, but because I'm not looking to break the record for ""longest Amazon review ever,"" I'll leave it at that.

What about discrepancies in the show itself?

In episode 213 (Crescent Hotel), Grant and Jason claim to have a recorded a ""full body apparition"" with their thermal imaging camera. They say the apparition is that of a man in a soldier's uniform. While I can't explain what they captured, I'm not sure that what I saw was a man in uniform. It seems to me they're just seeing what they want to see (or want the viewer to see) in a process similar to how one can imagine seeing all kinds of things in an inkblot.

In episode 219 (St. Augustine Lighthouse), having coincidentally not brought any female TAPS members with them for the investigation, they record a supposed EVP (an audio recording of a ghost) of a woman saying ""help me."" Only, I do not hear the woman saying this. It's not even clear to me that the voice heard is a woman's, or that it's even a voice at all. During the ""reveal,"" the representative of the lighthouse museum doesn't hear what they heard either. That is, until they suggest it. Then he hears it. Would the man have heard what they heard in the EVP if it hadn't been suggested to him?

In episode 220 (Domani's Restaurant), during the reveal we're told that one of four EVPs which consists of unintelligible speech is saying ""What is this contraption?"" The audio is so hard to make out that the show has to subtitle it for us, and even then it's hard to tell whether that's what the voice is actually saying. Subtitles are used again for the next EVP in which the voice is allegedly saying ""I'm staying here."" Notice a pattern? No one would be hearing these phrases if they weren't being suggested to them by Jason and Grant.

One of the EVPs, the ""I'm staying here"" one, sounds like it was a child's voice reversed in an audio editing program to play backwards. The other one, the ""what is this contraption?"" one, sounds like it was done using text-to-speech software (the same kind of mechanical voice you'd hear from the talking clock, a Speak & Spell, or something like that). I know TAPS sometimes like to ""clean up"" their EVPs in software before playing them for people, and that process can result in weird distortion being introduced that isn't present in the original, so I'll give the latter EVP the benefit of a doubt. But faking this kind of ""evidence"" in an audio editor (like the one they use, Cool Edit) would be child's play. A child's voice playing backwards? Sorry, that's a bit too Hollywood for me. Someone (maybe Jason?) was having some fun with an audio editor and a voice sample on that one.

In episode 217, Donna LaCroix and Mike Dion, while sitting in a darkened bedroom together, both claim to have heard a ghost exhaling about 3 feet away from them. The viewer actually hears the breathing sound while watching this scene. Problem is, it's obvious that the sound was added in afterwards in the editing studio, not only because it's much clearer than the rest of the audio in that scene, but also because Mike unequivocally states during the reveal that their audio recorder didn't capture the sound they claim to have heard (so why would the cameraman's gear have done any better?). That the producers think it's OK to dub in ghost sounds during post-production without informing the viewer ought to make a sensible person question everything he's shown on the show.

It's telling that the show doesn't have a notice at the beginning to the effect that ""some of what you are about to see has been staged, scripted, and dramatized but the actual evidence gathered in the course of TAPS investigations is authentic and has not in any way been modified or tampered with."" Not that that would prove anything, but the makers of the show aren't willing to go as far as to even commit to that. For all anyone knows, the show could be pure fiction. The producers don't claim otherwise.

Donna LaCroix, who is no longer a member of TAPS, was interviewed on the GhostDivas podcast of November 12, 2009. When asked if there was any trickery involved in the show, she refused to answer, stating, at 23:20, ""There was a lot of editing involved... I wish I could say something, but legally, I don't know [if I can]...""

Was Donna trying to tell us in not so many words that Ghost Hunters is fake but that she's not allowed to talk about it for fear of legal reprisals? Or is it a case of sour grapes, of dropping spiteful innuendos about her former employers after a bitter parting of ways? Your answer will likely depend on how devoted you are to the show. Diehard fans are no more likely to accept that it's fake than supporters of TV evangelist Benny Hinn are to question the pastor's miraculous faith healings.

Some people say to just appreciate the show as entertainment and forget about whether or not it's real, but the problem with that is that the show ceases to be entertaining once you stop suspending your disbelief. Its pretense of being real is its only selling point; otherwise, in common with all ""reality shows,"" it would be nothing but an amateurish, bottom-of-the-barrel soap opera. If I want to watch fictional ghost stories, I'll take something with Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, or Bela Lugosi in it and not this crap, thank you.

Quite apart from the issue of whether it's real or not, there were technical aspects of the show that bothered me, such as:

* The music over scenes that shouldn't have had any. Why would an editor put music over scenes in which the viewer is trying to hear the noises that the ghost hunters say they hear?
* Some of these second season episodes used so much audio compression (to make them as loud as possible) that they became abrasive and difficult to listen to.
* There's a lot of material in the extras that should have been in the shows. The producers chose to omit it in order to leave in a bunch of ""reality show""-like interpersonal drama that has nothing to do with ghosts and that I could've cared less about.

With all the negative things I've said about the show, you might expect me to leave it only one star, but no, I'm giving it two, for no other reason than that they visit some impressive locations, for example, the St. Augustine Lighthouse in Florida.",1269734400,,10776,4.632460732984293

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

North Carolina.  My heart still breaks at the tampering with evidence on the Queen Mary.  All in all, it gives great insights into the TAPS team.

Jason and Grant are plumbers with Roto-Rooters during the day, and ghost hunters at night.  They approach each ""haunted"" location in an attempt to ""de-bunk"" the paranormal claims scientifically.  They use advanced equipment in their research, and many times their success is in ""disproving"" claims instead of proving them.  Give this DVD your full attention.  These ghost hunters will have you believing them over any other ""ghost hunters"" out there.  When they can't de-bunk a claim, they label the location as ""haunted"", and you know what?...You believe them!

It just so happend that there was some kind of interference on the disc(that you can visibly see), that ruined that specific episode for me. The disc kept freezing and getting scrambled. I had also purchased Season 3 Part 1 and on the last disc of it, I had the same problem that wouldn't allow me to watch the bonus investigation. It too had the markings on the disc. I don't know if this has happened on any of these discs before or not, but it should be checked out. Before this I've had good luck ordering dvds from here.",1220400000,,664,4.32
2604947,4,B000GDH8HE,"I've only recently been introduced to Ghost Hunters and found this DVD very entertaining.  The way TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society) goes about their investigations is quite unique.  I was expecting something along the lines of how a psychic picks up ""feelings"" or ""voices in their head"" which of course the rest of us don't experience.  Instead TAPS conducts a scientific analysis of the situation.  The haunting is then either verified or debunked.  More than not, at least in this season, they are debunked.  Instead of feelings, they use equipment, such as EMF readers, infared cameras, digital cameras, and digital voice recorders to try and catch EVPs.

The real charm of the series comes from the individuals that play a part of the TAPS team.  Both Jason and Grant are very likable characters.  They are hard-working family men who work for Roto-Rooter during the day, but  hunt ghosts at night.  They each have children and place an increased importance on cases that involve children.  The other members of the team from Donna to Brian to Andy each have great characteristics that make them entertaining to watch.

The product itself contains 4 discs.  Each disc is broken down into 3 episodes (2 on the last DVD along with 2 unseen adventures).  The episodes can be viewed independently or one after the other automatically.  There is a bonus feature of deleted scenes.  I really wish they just would have included those scenes in the episode which they belong.  It would have made for a cleaner product.

Why is it that you only do these video downloads for PC's only and for portable video players that very few people actually own? I was seriously looking forward to catching up on season 4 - and loading them onto my ipod and I can't.

I understand that the TAPS guys have no control over how their content is sold, so I am not pissed at them, I am pissed that the people who think that making this stuff compatable for pc's only and for crappy portable video players is okay.

However...the audio is inexcusable; the ""clipping"" (sound levels way too high) creates a raspy, distorted soundtrack. I've never heard anything as inferior as this, which doesn't speak well of the manufacturer.

It's unfortunate that these shows also included the petty squabbling among cast members, which consumes a major chunk of several shows. So-and-so forgot the table, so-and-so has always been a troublemaker (yes he is, and he talks like he's got a mouthful of cotton).

2604968,5,B000GDH8HE,"I have all the Ghost Hunters seasons yet available on DVD, and Season Two: Part 2 is probably the best, if not really close to it!

If you do a youtube search on some of the greatest video evidence Grant and Jason and TAPS have collected, right there at the top you'll find the apparition at the Crescent Hotel, the footage in the St. Augustine Lighthouse, a pretty darn good piece from Waverly Hills, and of course, all the goings on in the Stanley Hotel where The Shining was filmed.

All of these are on this particular 4 DVD set! I'm a mega GH fan, so I recommend all of the seasons, but this one really does have some of the best stuff on it.

Whether you're a believer, a skeptic or on the fence, do yourself a favor and watch this show. Some say it's boring in certain episodes, but I think the fact that they don't always get mindblowing evidence, or any for that matter, adds credibility to TAPS. There is no doubt in my mind that what you see is what you get with these guys, though I will warn that the producers/editors/whatever of this show do their best to keep it exciting by adding spooky music sometimes and very often cut in quick flashes of creepy and/or gruesome imagery. Sometimes this annoys me, but I suppose it would be a slow show without it in places.

The Stanley Hotel and Waverly Hills Sanitorium were both so exciting and active that TAPS used them as locations for their live Halloween investigations: The Stanley in 2006 and Waverly Hills in 07.",1195862400,,1477,4.3992673992674

I love that they are one of us and they get just as excited as we would when they capture paranormal phenonmena.  I love Jason and Grant's friendly rapport and respect for each other.

I love the main ghosthunters, they are a wonderful group of people and it's great how they react towards their experiences. This goes beyond ghost movies/tv shows. This is actual ghost encounters. It is very realistic. I know a lot of people say a lot of things, that they are fake - or their facts aren't straight. . . but watch it with an open-mind and you will be thrilled.

My favorite episode was the St. Augustine lighthouse investigation which is on this dvd.

My only complaint is the sound quality isn't all that great.
Also, I have issues with little ""sound effects"" the editors felt like they needed to add to the experience. It actually RUINS the experience in my opinion. It's like ""I don't hear anything. Oh I heard it! Wait was that music from the show?"" Change those flaws, and you got yourself a 5 star dvd. But as of now 3 stars.",1176422400,2,930,4.432748538011696

2605041,5,B000GDH8HE,"i picked up all 3 box sets of the series recently and paid a little over $60 dollars for the entire purchase... thats roughly the price of one season of ""csi"" at regular price... so in that sense this is a great buy, each season set is only $20 dollars for 4 dvds... thats right i bought 3 sets, a total of 11 dvds  for the price of a regular 4 or 5 dvd disc set... so a great buy in terms of quantity and substance of the show...

visually its not too bad but a little grainy, a little pixelated is a better way to put it, sometimes it breaks up a little bit, but nothing horrid...

audio wise, it has a little muffled buzz sound to when people talk, something that can be remedied if you turn the tremble/bass down... still its a bit annoying at first... but considering the price, your being a little picky to complain about the quality of the product...

the show itself is great and wildly entertaining... i hate reality shows with a passion because shows such as american idol, survivor and celebrity dancing or whatever its called in my opinon plagued the minds and attention spands of viewers... now everyone cant sit thru a regular tv series, or watch a show that has a long arching storyline because they are use to being able to watch a brainless show that has a new theme every episode... for that, shows that were really good have been canceled and replaced by crap aka reality shows...

but Ghost Hunters is a nice little exception, this is because its got a nice little paranormal element to it that reminds me of the fun aspects of the x files, nightstalker and supernatural... hehe, its for a good little scare when these guys who go into a house expecting to prove the believers wrong actually end up being witness to a true paranormal event and become believers themselves... these guys aren't actors but are enjoyable to watch because of the whole arguments they have and fact that they are telling you the history of the supernatural event that details why they are there... so it makes for a nice little history lesson too...

this is a great dvd set to buy, i highly suggest buying all of the sets and avidly await the 3rd season when it is released...

hope this helps...

2605042,5,B000GDH8HE,"the reason your getting this obviously is that youve seen this show on sci-fi and found it entertaining... now the only difference i found between this and the broadcast version is the sound is a par fuzzy... sometimes you need to turn the tremble/bass down a bit to make the sound a little easier to understand when the fellas are talking loudly... but on the most part its not too terrible...

visually its pretty good but a little pixelated during night/dark room scenes, but you have to take into consideration that these sets are giving you 4 dvds for $20 dollars...

If you wanted a remastered video/audio edition, youd probably be paying the price of other seasons of tv shows that are in the mid $50 dollar range...

so i just try to not be to complantive about things and enjoy the show for its substance...

its worth the price and very entertaining... so i highly suggest picking up a copy so when season 3 is finished we fans can get the next season on dvd...

hope i helped you decide on this...

2605043,1,B000GDH8HE,I was disappointed to see more personal/business issues as ghost/haunting issues. I am living overseas and never saw any of the original broadcasts. Truly disappointed.,1170892800,2,168,5.76
2605044,3,B000GDH8HE,"(See my review for Part 1 for more details)

Entertaining show and, arguably, the best season so far.",1170720000,,101,4.611111111111111
2605045,3,B000GDH8HE,"While this show isn't perfect (what show is?), it IS entertaining. The second season of Ghost Hunters seems slightly faster-paced and a little more slickly produced than season one. The new black vans (with places for storing equipment) and their new more-spacious office headquarters are much-needed improvements over the one van and small trailer HQ from the first season. The show's producers started investigating more famous haunted locations in this season, too. The places they go to are more visually interesting than most of the first season locations.

Still, while the overall quality of the show improved in season two, there are still some annoying elements to the show that should be addressed: SOME of the cases of hauntings seemed like they might be faked (such as the lamp being slowly pulled toward the edge of the nightstand) in order to deliver a more satisfying show. After all, if they don't find any hauntings it will be disappointing, right? Still, if any of these were faked (I've got no proof that they were), the producers should stop it. Also, the continuing soap opera of Brian is annoying to me. First it was that Brian kept screwing up all the time. Then it was the fact that Brian had a girlfriend who kept calling him during the investigations and then she convinced him to quit the team (and the show). Then he broke up with her and came crawling back to Grant and Jason wanting to rejoin. They didn't want to bring him back at first and then, when they did, they were arguing with him about the whole deal. Enough! Maybe some people liked all that hooey, but I didn't! Stick to the investigations, please!

Anyway, I haven't watched every episode on this DVD set yet, but of the ones I watched, the DVDs seem to be of good quality with little or no mess ups. I wish they had put the whole second season on one DVD set instead of breaking them up into two seperate sets. I know this keeps the individual prices of each set down, but if you are a fan (like me), you will buy both sets and wind up paying the same price as you would if they had released only one set (around 30 to 40- something bucks). So, what's the difference?

I really didn't like the way the individual DVD disks are stacked on top of each other in the sets. They are somewhat difficult to get out without scratching or dropping them. It would have been better if they were each attached individually like most DVD sets.

The extras are varying in quality. Some of the bloopers are fun, but most of the deleted scenes were deleted for a reason: They were boring! It's always fun to have extras on DVDs, though.",1170720000,,2614,4.543524416135881
2605046,2,B000GDH8HE,"This DVD set had a lot of potential, but it falls victim to sloppy DVD production.  The show its self is great, but they really dropped the ball in bringing it to DVD.  The menu options link to incorrect content, and the audio quality is so atrocious that it becomes a major distraction.  The problem with the audio is that it's too hot (loud), and as a result it becomes distorted and annoying.  I thought it was either my dvd player or my TV until I played it in my computer and had the same problem.  I have experience with audio/video production and I am in awe of the fact that this was released in its current state.  Those associated with the process of moving this show to DVD format should be ashamed of what I would call a ripoff.  Keep your money.",1170288000,2,758,4.258741258741258
2605047,3,B000GDH8HE,"I started to watch this show on cable during Halloween this year. I was hooked right away. I then bought the first and second season. This part 1 of Season 2 was just alright. There were alot of episodes that amounted to nothing which I understand is the point of this show since they are looking to ""debunk"" alot of peoples claims of paranormal activity.

But after watching episode after episode it got kinda boring. The one thing I noticed is that they are always talking about other cases they were on that sounded much more interesting that the ones they had filmed. I suggest that the next jobs they choose to film have a better balance of ones where there are actual hauntings and ones they prove wrong....or even better yet,hoaxes people would try to pass off and they bust them.

If you are a die hard fan of the show I would still check this one out just to see more episdoes, but watch out for some sound issues on some of these recordings.

2605051,3,B000GDH8HE,"Don't believe? Well this series might convince you, if you trust that the filming and editing is honest. I tend to believe that it is.

Jason and Grant are plumbers and are the chief investigators of TAPs (The Atlantic Paranormal Society). They take time from their day jobs to investigate Ghosts.

My main complaint about the series is that it spends too much time with the team members relationships and not enough showing the real investigations.

The worst feature is the overdubs, scary images and sounds used to try and jazz it up.

Folks Hitchcock proved it a long time ago, less is often more.

The best thing about the series is Jason and Grant, who often disprove hauntings or Ghosts and do not accept everything told them at face value.

They travel extensively and tell the history of places and people.

Hey, thats a whole show in itself.

Be better if each show was 90 minutes, the outtakes prove that and deserved to be on the show.

Worst of all is the hokey surprise shots used to hook viewers when the ads  come up, they don't need them.

Best episode ever is the light house in St. Augustine.  Watch it and you have a simple choice, believe what you see or become convinced its a hoax.

There really isn't much of a choice otherwise.

I tend to believe Jason and Grant but I'd fell better with less special effects and hype.

Also the whole ghost tours business has helped create an industry.

I dread the Bed and Breakfast ghosts (somebody says...legend is...a former manager saw..).

Too many operators are reading a handbook, ""How to Ghost your business into Profitability""; Jason and Grant seem to think so too.

I love the series despite it's flaws and the DVDs are infinitely better than the regular broadcast (although mine had sound quality issues, I have the whole series and this is the only one with that problem).",1168300800,,1844,4.621538461538462

2605062,5,B000GDH8HE,"This show is just great! I can't get enough of T.A.P.S. I understand that maybe some people have had trouble with the DVDs but I have had no such problem. Audio and video have both been fine for me. It's no Lord of the Rings in terms of production value but it is also not near as bad as everyone makes it out to be. If you watch just one episode, especially one where they get something on video, you will never turn back. If you watch this show on SciFi and like it buy the DVD.",1163808000,,480,3.9587628865979383

2605064,5,B000GDH8HE,I don't know what everyone is talking about but the audio quality was fine to me!! This show gives me the creeps and cant be more real then this. I love my dvd set and it was worth my money. I honestly say that the quality is great. This show is one of my favorites and I cannot wait for Season 3 to be on dvd!!,1163376000,2,311,3.727272727272727
2605065,5,B000GDH8HE,I personally love Ghost Hunters. Even when they don't find anything I still love it.  I really like all of the people and I love to see them even though I don't always agree with them. Alot of people out there say they made this up or that up or it's boring because they didn't get anything on video! But I really don't care about their negative opinions.  The show rocks and the people rock.  If you don't like it...guess what....don't watch it! I recommend the show to anyone who likes the idea of scary things. If you want something extreme then you need to go watch a scary movie!,1163289600,,584,4.290909090909091

2605068,4,B000GDH8HE,"Ok well there's not much to say other than what's already said in the other reviews.  Love the show and all, but I do have a few complaints.  Number one, these guys from Big Vision really need to work on their DVD production.  With Season 1 it was loose DVDs in the box.  Now with Season 2/3 the DVDs have been secured but the audio is crap.  What gives??

Overmodulated is the word.  The video quality is mediocre and yes you will sometimes see nothing but pitch blackness.  don't blame it on the fact that the TAPS team like to work in darkness, there are plenty of ways to light things up.

The last complaint really has little to do with the quality of the DVDs but more so about the content.  Jerky camera movements, hysterical shouting and other faux pas really make it hard for the viewer to see and hear exactly what is going on.  Perhaps TAPS did capture something at the St. Augustine lighthouse, but I couldn't see a damn thing as it was happening.  And why did Jason and Grant rush up without any thermal imaging device?  Why was the device sitting on the ground?  If I encountered something that I truly believed to be paranormal, I'd have every piece of equipment at my disposal.  It's like rushing into a firefight without a gun.  The other side of the argument is that it is a tightly edited show and all....but still....sometimes their methods tend to baffle me.  I guess you just have to remember this is a reality TV show and there's always the fact that events are sometimes exaggerated for entertainment value.",1162512000,2,1531,4.469314079422382
2605069,4,B000GDH8HE,"Let's get one thing straight.  I love this show, and I'm a devoted fan.  I agree with the reviews that talk about the terrible audio quality because it really is difficult to hear at some points.

However, my complaint lies with a different topic.  Does anyone remember the episode where the TAPS team caught a shawdow figure dart from the left side of the frame behind the pool tables, and then dart back?  Where is that episode?  It's not on the season 1 or season 2 DVD sets!  I think they also cut out some scenes!  Does anyone remember the scene where Grant and Jason go to Brian's house and he asks to come back to TAPS??  In the season 2 DVDs, they show Brain leave, and then several cases later he just shows up with no explanation!!

I know these scenes/episodes exist - so where are they??",1161820800,,799,4.337837837837838
2605070,3,B000GDH8HE,I thought I was the only one with a bad quality DVD.  I love this series but the DVD quality is just horrible.  What is the deal?  It's almost a challenge to listen to the audio at times--and I have episodes from Season 1 that won't even play and I just have to skip them.  I took one of the sets back to Best Buy thinking I just got a bad copy but the replacement is no better.  Hope they can improve on this because this is a great TV show.,1160611200,3,442,3.8131868131868134
2605071,3,B000GDH8HE,"Thought I was going crazy - but thanks to Amazon and the reviewers I realize I'm not, indeed starting at Episode 209 (on Disc 3) - the audio takes a noticeable turn for the worse. Comparing the taped ""off the air"" shows to the DVD version ... audio ""clipping"" and distortion is present, I have no idea how a big studio doesn't notice this!

Granted, not having to endure endless commercials is helpful, but why a REDUCTION in audio crispness? Well, the first Season's DVD case was abysmal (my Disc 2 fell off the hub and was scratched) but the audio on those discs was fine ... now on Season 2 & 3 the reverse is true (nice ""super-gripper"" cases but abysmal audio quality)!

(NOVEMBER 8, 2007 - UPDATE!!!!)

- Did mail back my original DVD covers to get the replacement DVDs (""remastered"" audio) from Big Vision Entertainment (other reviewers mentioned about the replacements ... thanks).

Took 24 days for the replacements to arrive. Oddly, the new and old boxes have the same UPC #'s which is going to make it very hard for a buyer to know what copies are which ""edition"". Unfortunately (for whatever reason?) Season 2: Part 2's DVD case came in a horrendous multi-swing case divider (all my discs where thrown around inside like a tornado hit, yes they got scratched). Season 2: Part 1 came in what the original Season 2 DVDs came in ... an Acecase ""super-gripper"" 4 Disc tray which held the DVDs in place by ""vice grip-like"" holders. I did listen to two random episodes from the ""remastered"" versions:

(Season 2: Part 1 - Disc 3) EPISODE 9: WORTHINGTON HOME / ROLLING HILLS ASYLUM ~ The TAPS team investigates reports of paranormal phenomena at the Worthington's house and try to assure the family that their house is safe. Then the team travels to Rolling Hills Asylum to investigate reports from visitors of hair tugging, noises and phantom smells at the former insane asylum in Bethany, N.Y.

(Season 2 - Part 2 - Disc 8) EPISODE 21: STONE LION INN / EDGERLY HOME ~  The Oklahoma Paranormal Society (a member of the TAPS family) refers to Grant and Jason its case file for The Stone Lion Inn in Guthrie, Oklahoma. The inn was previously a private residence and a funeral home. Grant and Jason talk with Kristen Perkins and Christine Selfridge of TOPS. The women say they've seen shadows and have captured EVPs during their investigations. Later TAPS heads to the home of Dave Edgerly in New Bedford, Massachusetts, responding to a call from Dave's friend, Kathy Elmore, who is concerned about Dave because he's ""a different person"" when he's outside the house. During the investigation, Brian and Steve discover, in a closet under the stairs, an electrical box that gives off dangerously high EMF readings. In the basement, they find mold that might be causing Dave's headaches. As the team continues to investigate, they realize that Dave uses his house to store chemicals, such as paint strippers and acetone, that can aerosolize and disperse through the vents. Even though Jason and Grant can't guarantee that there isn't any paranormal activity in the house, they tell Kathy and Dave that the house's other safety issues need to be addressed. They explain that the chemicals, the mold and the EMF radiation can cause fatigue, headaches, depression and nausea. They show him the problems one by one and tell him to fix them.

Yes, it is readily apparent that the new audio is back the way it should be (audiotorily legible). Thankfully, Big Vision Entertainment confessed their error - originally I had no intention of ever buying anymore Ghost Hunters DVDs after the Season Two's were released (a pre-order on my part, none the less).

Well, when comparing the laser etching on the play side of the disc(s) themself (hold under a light to see the very small printing), the difference between new and old can be told:

Original defective versions:

GHOST HUNTERS (SEASON 2) DISC 3
GHOST HUNTERS (SEASON 2) DISC 8

New ""remastered"" versions:

GHOST HUNTERS DISC 3 (SEASON 2)
GHOST HUNTERS DISC 8 (SEASON 2)

... Note the slight difference in the word ordering. Hopes this helps all the Ghost Hunter fans out there, and I feel for the poor people who unknowingly get stuck with any ""old"" Season 2 DVD sets out there.",1159660800,5,4225,4.754098360655738
2605072,3,B000GDH8HE,The episodes in this season were fanstatic but the quality is extremely poor. Both sound and picture suffered throughout most episodes and at times the show would freeze for a few seconds. I thought it was my dvd player that caused the problems but I see that others experienced the same diffculties. I wish I held back and read some reviews before purchasing these dvds that way I would of known what to expect and held back on ordering them. For the price we paid we should at least get our moneys worth.,1159660800,3,506,4.451612903225806
2605073,2,B000GDH8HE,"As a huge fan of this show I could not wait to buy both of season two's DVD's. However, they are so poorly made it has been a very disappointing ordeal as I have ordered and returned two sets of the DVD's twice due to very bad static and overly loud voice audio. The color was off as well. I thought it was just bad luck until I read everyone's reviews. Hopefully the problem will be fixed and someday I will be able to purchase good quality Ghost Hunters videos.",1159574400,6,463,4.155555555555556
2605074,3,B000GDH8HE,"Many have already said it, but I'll say it again.  This is one of the best shows on T.V.  So why the crappy video and sound quality.  The audio in particular is horrible.  It reminds me of what it sounds like when you talk to close to a microphone.  And the video is very choppy and the colors vary.  Watching the show on the SciFi channel is ten times better than this DVD.  I have never complained about DVD quality before, but this is so bad that it is actually a distraction.  I don't want people to not buy the dvd, but you might be better off getting the itunes version.",1159574400,17,576,4.126126126126126
2605075,1,B000GDH8HE,"After receiving two different sets of both these DVD's, plus the season 2 ""best of"", I wish I had not ordered, returned, ordered again, etc.

The video is very dark at times to the point where the screen looks black, and the sound so grainy that on some of the episodes you cannot understand what is being said at all for the entire episode.

This was a huge disappointment.  I've read where some people get perfect copies and others get the same as me - hopefully it was a just a bad batch and the problem DVD's are being pulled and replaced by good copies.

I'll wait a few months and see if the problems are fixed.  Hopefully Big Vision will put a notice up on their website, but they don't even have the DVD's available yet.",1159401600,4,728,4.2846715328467155
2605076,4,B000GDH8HE,"""Ghost Hunters:  Season 2, Part 2,"" is actually composed of episodes from SciFi channel's Season 3.  It includes some very recognizable hotspots such as the Lizzie Borden house, the prison used in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the heavily viewed Willard Library.  Much like the ""Season 2, Part 1"" set, this DVD set suffers from poor audio and grainy video.  With that said, however, Big Vision has remedied the problem they had with the first season's DVD set, which was that the DVD's came loose during shipping or the case was easily damaged from the factory to the front door of the customer.  The new cases that are used for Season 2 are wonderful, and seem to have been developed by the guys who came up with childproof medicine bottles.

The shows are wonderful to watch, especially the St. Augustine Lighthouse episode in which the TAPS team comes up with some amazing evidence.  I'm always impressed with the professionalism and seriousness exuded by the TAPS squad.  Sure, the team often bickers over things too much, but it's due to this bickering that they come up with such strong evidence.  I've always pictured the team's founders, Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, as a good cop/bad cop duo.  Grant seems to be the quiet, understanding type, whereas Jason is just a stubborn mule.  The interaction between these two and the rest of the team makes for great television, even if they don't come up with any great evidence on some cases.

Overall, I'd say that this DVD set is worthy of purchase.  Sure, the audio and video are somewhat annoying at times, but this is more than made up for by the actual episodes and the sometimes giddy joy displayed by members of TAPS when they find some sort of evidence that gives them hope for their cause.

Highly recommended.",1159315200,18,1774,4.736156351791531
2605077,4,B000GDH8HE,"Big Vision, the company responsible for putting out ""Ghost Hunters:  Season 2, Parts 1 and 2"" and ""Ghost Hunters:  Season 1,"" still have a long way to go with the production quality of their discs, but they definitely listen to their customers and attempt to make corrections.  For starters, they've hulked up the DVD cases for Season 2, making it virtually impossible for the discs to become dislodged during shipping.  This was a major complaint of many folks of Season 1's release.  Secondly, the picture has gotten better.  Granted, it's not perfect, and it's still too grainy during the investigations to see everything that's going on, but it has improved slightly.  Finally, the audio is okay.  As stated before, there is still plenty of space for changes and improvements, but Big Vision seems to be taking its customers advice to heart.

Now, on to Season 2, Part 1, in which we find Jason and Grant and the rest of the TAPS team seeking out more ghosts or lack thereof.  This particular set includes one of my favorite cases:  Myrtles Plantation.  They also revisit Eastern State Penitentiary and tackle the Rolling Hills Asylum, the wacky Winchester House, and the U.S.S. North Carolina.

TAPS has always managed to impress me with their professionalism.  Search any number of ""ghost hunting"" websites and you'll see that many of them are nothing more than a bunch of teen and college-aged kids hanging out in the graveyard or trespassing onto abandoned property.  TAPS takes the paranormal very seriously.  It almost takes an act of God to make them label a location as haunted.  When they do, you can rest assured that they've done everything in their power to debunk a ghost's existence.

I highly recommend this DVD set, as well as Part 2 of Season 2 and the first season.  You'll be impressed at how the TAPS team takes time to explain what an EMF detector is, what ""orbs"" are and probably aren't, and how something as simple as a mirror can play tricks on your mind.

Another great thing about this particular set is in the deleted scenes area where Brian is confronted by a woman and called a few derogatory terms.  It's fun at the expense of Brian, but let's face it, Brian's just a funny guy.
