155666,5,0792842006,"Here's a screenplay that should be studied in film school.  Seriously.  It starts out with a bang and holds your interest for a slammin' first act.  Then, just when you're sayin' to yourself, ""OK, this is fun, but where the hell is it going?"" the movie makes a 180-degree turn at the 30-minute mark and totally peels out into something you've never seen before.  One of the few instances where 3 writers on an action movie is actually a GOOD thing (especially since one of them is Michael Allin, who wrote ENTER THE DRAGON, and another is Oscar Williams, who gave us THE FINAL COMEDOWN and BLACK BELT JONES).  Brilliantly directed by Jonathan Kaplan.  Solid supporting performances from Alan Weeks, Nichelle Nichols, Dick Miller, Stan Shaw, Stymie Beard from the Little Rascals, and especially Sam Laws, who always turns up as a character named ""Dinwiddie"" in Kaplan's early films (see also THE STUDENT TEACHERS, THE SLAMS, and WHITE LINE FEVER).  Special mention should also go to Yaphet Kotto, who one year earlier had claimed that his role in LIVE AND LET DIE was racist, but apparently thought nothing of collecting a paycheck here by playing a murderous pimp (or, even worse, two years later in DRUM, where he portrayed a slave who is stripped nude, hung upside down, and asswhipped to a bloody pulp).  Also, you gotta love any movie featuring an Italian hitman named ""Joe Dante"" (Kaplan and future GREMLINS director Joe Dante were both working for Roger Corman at the time this movie was produced.  I think WHITE LINE FEVER also features a character named Joe Dante).  Last but not least, the score by Isaac Hayes is amazing.  If you can find the double-CD (paired with his equally great THREE TOUGH GUYS soundtrack), grab it!  I play it all the time, and it's always being sampled by hip hop performers.  Definitely check this sucker out.",974246400,3,1845,4.782334384858044

155668,5,0792842006,"Isaac Hayes plays an ex football star turned bounty hunter named Mac ""Truck"" Turner.  After he and his partner kill a violent pimp named ""Gator"", all the pimps get together and a contract is put  out on Truck by none other than Gator's woman (Star Trek's Nichelle  Nichols).  When all the little fish fail to kill Truck, the biggest pimp of  them all, Harvard Blue (Homicide's Yaphet Kotto) makes an offer to have it  done but for a big price.  Does he succeed?  What do you think?
Truck  Turner is a great part of the blaxploitation genre and of action films in  general.  Isaac Hayes makes a great action hero and I wish he had made more  films like this.  Isaac also provides for one of the funkiest soundtracks  ever, maybe better than Shaft.  The film is exciting from beginning to end  and Truck finds time to romance his lady and to make some jokes in between.  One of the funny scenes include when Truck and his partner go to pick up a  prisoner from a military base and they have to break through the check  point.  When the security guards start shooting at Trucks car, he hopes  they shoot his left tire out because he needs a new one real bad.  Guess  what, not only do they shoot the left tire out but they have to put the new  one on for him!  The rest of the time you will be laughing when you hear  all the words that Nichelle Nichols has learned since Star Trek!",953596800,2,1379,4.2684824902723735

Starring the late, great Isaac Hayes as Mac ""Truck"" Turner, a bounty hunter that finds himself with a price on his head, Truck Turner offers everything fans of the genre could want. A killer theme song and score provided by Hayes, non-stop action, with great over-the-top dialog and bloodshed.

Toss into the mix an excellent supporting cast with Roger Corman favorite Dick Miller as the bail bondsman that starts all of Turner's troubles, to ""Star Trek"" star Nichelle Nichol's turn as a violent, vengeance driven Madame, Scatman Crothers as a retired pimp and Yaphet Kotto as the new boss in town, and you have a 90 minute masterpiece.",1460937600,,710,4.819672131147541

155702,5,0792842006,"Truck Turner is a slightly satirical but still relatively serious ""blaxploitation"" movie, but what's really important is that it's just a great, fun 70's action flick that entertains the whole way through. Upbeat music from star Isaac Hayes, great characters and dialog, fun chases, fun shootouts and some surprising (and very 70's) twists and turns. Any movie with Star Trek's Uhura talking about her prostitutes with phrases like ""we call her turnpike, 'cause you pay to get on and pay to get off"" can't be anything but entertaining. Seriously good shots like the final battle and use of LA give it scope and intensity too. Just a great package all over.

Kino's disc is one of their better ones. The blu-ray has a nice HD image that, while perhaps not a recent remaster, shows a ton of detail and very little flaw. Some noise in dark scenes can distract, but the film grain is usually well-defined and appealing and the urban film look is very well represented. Sound was clean, which was nice since many of these 70's exploitation flicks feature too much crackle and distortion, but Truck Turner sounds like it was cleared up and remastered to some degree with no real flaws.

Features include one of the better commentaries I have heard recently. The director and a moderator get into all aspects of production and behind-the-scenes stories and this is one blunt conversation. Very few punches are pulled as the director talks about who had an attitude on set, what the studio really wanted and why many decisions were made (or not made). In addition to this great commentary there is a panel interview, a ""trailers from hell"" skit and the normal trailer. It's not the most robust package ever seen, but it's all highly entertaining and well worth listening to.

Overall Kino hit this one out of the park, much like Miracle Mile, Cherry 2000 and some other releases. They are truly evolving into a very impressive label and Truck Turner is very much a release worth getting if you like 70's action, blaxploitation and good audio commentaries. Highly recommended.",1441584000,2,2067,4.84985835694051

Hayes played Mack ""Truck"" Turner, a bounty hunter who works for the government. Hired assassins try to kill him after he hunts down a pimp. Truck Turner was modern in 1974: there's strong violence, foul language, politically-incorrect humor and sexy women in revealing clothes! Yaphet Kotto played one of the bad guys in the film. He played a Bond villain around this time. Isaac Hayes also composed the music score for the film. In the early 1970's, some people were willing to pay money to see movies about Black anti-heroes. By the 1980's, people were losing interest in the blaxploitation genre. Keenan Ivory Wayans' I'm Gonna Get You Sucka(1988) is an homage to 1970's blaxploitation films.

155782,4,0792842006,"Get this: the eponymous bounty hunter character played by Isaac Hayes in this 1974 blaxploitation flick was originally supposed to be played by Robert Mitchum; when that fell through, it became a James Coburn vehicle, and when the Coburn pic didn't work out, AIP decided, ""lets go urban"" with up-and-coming Dick Anthony Williams, and when THAT failed, Isaac Hayes - just beginning his acting career - got the ball.  With all that flip-flopping going on it's amazing that it didn't turn out to be terrible - and in fact it's no wonder that the film at times doesn't seem to fit Hayes' particular persona - or that Hayes mumbles through a lot of his lines and doesn't always seem as with it as many of his more experienced peers in the film.

But ultimately this doesn't matter much, because Jonathan Kaplan (just 26 when he made this, his fourth feature) puts it all together with plenty of style - perhaps too much style in one or two scenes, like a slow death near the end of the film that's played out to near laughability - Yaphet Kotto is on hand for some fine menace, and the action sequences are terrifically handled.  A car-foot-car chase that occupies ten minutes or so just before the half-hour mark is particularly spectacular.  Oh, and Isaac Hayes' musical contribution is every bit as impressive as his score for SHAFT a couple of years earlier.

The plot - well, does it matter so much?  Truck Turner and his partner Jerry (Alan Weeks) are low-rent bounty hunters working out of a seedy office for the seedier Nate (Sam Laws) in L.A.  The first twenty minutes or so are all character stuff and in many ways are the best part of the film.  The buddy-cop behavior between Truck and Jerry, Truck's problematic relationship with his girl Annie (Annazette Chase), their dealings with the cops, are all done with a fine mixture of comedy and just-controlled energy - violence can break out at any point in this world and usually does.  But after Truck and Jerry have to kill a dangerous pimp that they're trying to bring back, all hell breaks loose and local queen pimp Dorinda (Nichelle Nichols, yes Uhuru all skanked out and filthy-mouthed) vows vengeance for his death, enlisting the cold eyes and emotionless brutality of Blue (Kotto).  Of course, Blue and Dorinda and all their hired guns just don't know what they're up against.

One of the best blaxploitation films I've seen yet, really only marred by a pretty standard action ending (reasonably well shot, but predictable) that is just a slight letdown after some really promising character work at the start of the film.  Excellent use of L.A. locations and it's especially fun to see just how many times a bad guy gets killed with the backdrop of the city skyline perfectly framed behind him - sometimes followed by a wide-angle shot of Truck with one of his huge guns, also silhoutted against the steel canyons.

155786,4,0792842006,"Isaac Hayes made his mark by winning an Academy Award for best original song for his work on the 1971 film Shaft, and while his musical compositions for the film Truck Turner (1974) may not have been as successful, it did mark the first time Hayes appeared in a starring role, appearing in one of the better films to come out of the `blaxploitation' era of the 70s, in my opinion.  Co-written by Michael Allin (Enter the Dragon), Jerry Wilkes, and Oscar Williams (The Final Comedown, Black Belt Jones), and directed by Jonathan Kaplan (Night Call Nurses, The Accused, ""ER""), the film stars Isaac Hayes (Escape from New York, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka), Yaphet Kotto (Live and Let Die, Alien, Midnight Run), and Nichelle Nichols, whom most probably know best from her role on the original Star Trek television series and subsequent films as Lieutenant Uhura, the sexiest communications officer this side of the Crab Nebula...also appearing is Alan Weeks (Black Belt Jones), Annazette Chase (The Mack), Sam Laws (Cool Breeze, Walking Tall), and Paul Harris (Across 110th Street).  Appearing in cameo roles are Charles Cyphers (Halloween, The Fog, Escape from New York), the legendary Scatman Crothers (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shining, Bronco Billy), veteran character actor and AIP perennial Dick Miller (The Wild Angels, Piranha, Gremlins), and the late Matthew Beard, best known as that bowler hat wearing lil' rascal Stymie, from the Hal Roach `Our Gang' shorts of the 30s.

Hayes plays Truck Turner who, along with his partner Jerry (Weeks), make their living as bounty hunters, that is, they run down jive turkeys who jump bail, decided not to participate in the subsequent legal process due to the fact they're probably guilty as sin, and conviction, along with jail time, are imminent.  The two are very good at what they do, so much so they often get the jobs no one else wants. One in particular, arises involving a nasty pimp named Gator (Harris).  Seems Gator's a two-time loser, and a third conviction would send him up for a long time, so apprehension will be extremely difficult (I think his crime has something to do his painting a Lincoln Continental, with suicide doors, hot pink...egads!).  Gator gets jiggy, and Truck and Jerry have to take him down hard, much to the dismay of Gator's woman Dorinda (Nichols), who offers a piece of the action of her stable of extra fine call girls to the first Mack who can bring her the head of Truck Turner...many try, and many fail, meeting up with the business end of Turner's Magnum street cannon, suffering a fatal case of lead poisoning.  After the smoke clears, Harvard Blue (Kotto) makes the scene, driving a hard bargain with Dorinda (who's now between a rock and a hard place as Truck learns of her scheme to have him killed), and eventually calls in some heavy duty, out of town hitters.  Blue puts the screws to Turner, as he and his men make it extremely personal, but the big payback's coming, as Truck's out to settle everyone's hash....can you dig it?  I can...

I enjoyed Truck Turner a lot, as it had nearly everything I look for in a blaxploitation film, including lots of action, hard pumping `wakacha' music, interesting characters, misogynistic attitudes (Dorinda was the worst of the bunch, in this aspect), revenge motifs, plenty of colorful slang dialog, car chases, foot chases, serious beat downs, guns, obscenely 70s clothes, foul language, sexy women, bad attitudes, idiot racists getting their due...the only thing the movie lacked was a bit o' the nekkidness (Ms. Nichols had it going on in everyway, too bad she wasn't prone to sharing it like her more well known contemporary Pam Grier). One of the elements I liked most about the film was how director Kaplan kept the story moving along at a strong pace.  I thought Hayes did particularly well, this being his first starring role, but the smart casting of experienced actors like Kotto and Nichols helped him immeasurably.  I even enjoyed the subplot featuring Truck's girlfriend Annie (Chase), who was recently released from jail.  One of my favorite scenes included Truck setting her up on a bogus shoplifting charge if only to put her back in jail and out of harms way.  And Truck sure knew how to woo the ladies...where some men might bring flowers when picking up their girlfriend upon release from jail, Truck brings a six-pack.  Nothing says `I love you' like a sixer of cheap brew.  Another great scene involved Gator's `pimped' out funeral (attention MTV execs, here's a new show idea...Pimp My Funeral...pure programming gold), and the players depositing some white, powdery substance (flour?) into the casket, as a form of respect, I suppose...I'm not familiar with this particular custom, but maybe I'll try it at the next service I attend.  As I said, there's no nekkidness, but a whole lot of skin (especially from Hayes' bald head)...if this is so, why's the film rated R?  It's simple...the profanities fly through this movie like nobodies business...geezum crow Nichelle Nichols, whose character has about the foulest mouth in the film, never talked like that on Star Trek...and then there's the violence.  Gut shots, leg shots, even a blood spurting face shot...woo hoo!  I know a lot of people gripe about the glorification of violence within cinema, but I have to tell you, it was great to see characters just cut loose on each other in displays of bloody mayhem.  Lastly I wanted to mention the excellent musical scoring composed and performed by Isaac Hayes, rhythm supplied by The Isaac Hayes Experience, and back up voices by Hot Buttered Soul Unlimited.  Few worked scores as well for these films as Hayes, with the exception being that of Curtis Mayfield.

Released through MGM's Soul Cinema line, the anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture quality on this DVD is very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through very clear.  The only extra available is a theatrical trailer, which is almost as enjoyable as the film itself.

If I learned anything from this film it's that bounty hunters pretty much have free reign to do whatever they want, including beating up mopes, commandeering vehicles, participating in high speed car chases, and shooting people in public, in self defense, of course, all without having to worry about any messy legal entanglements.  Also, if you're caring for your girlfriend's cat while she's in the joint, don't leave your last, good shirt lying about as the cat is liable to whiz on it...",1129766400,5,6525,4.908181818181818
155787,5,0792842006,"When there's crime about in 1970's Los Angeles, Black folks didn't call 911. They called Truck Turner ex football player turned lawman of the ghetto.

Issac Hayes is Truck Turner, a big black guy with a big black gun dispensing vigilante justice on the streets of 1970's LA. When he's not fighting crime, he's fighting to keep his larcenous girlfriend out of jail. On his mission to clean up the streets, he runs afoul of a slimy pimp named Gator. Tuner blows him away with his big black gun and that leads to a whole lotta trouble for our hero. Gator's Madam (played by Nichelle Nichols, known formerly as Lt. Uhura to Trekkers) puts a contract out on Turner. Turner kills the hitmen fairly easily with that big black gun, but wonders why someone is trying to kill him. When the underlings fail, Lt. Uhura puts up her stable of escorts up as collateral to a bunch of pimps for them to do the job for her. Most fear Truck and his big gun, but decide to go along with the deal (well a stable of extra hoes is worth the risk for a pimp) hoping to screw Lt Uhura. over and take her hoes from her. When he hears that there's a contract on him, Truck Takes action. He protects his girlfriend by having her arrested for shoplifting, then he goes after the pimps taking them out one by one until a thrilling climatic battle between himself and Harvard Blue (Yaphett Kotto) in a hospital. A shootout in a hospital! Well at least they'll be able to get medical attention quickly. The way the final gun battle ends is worth the price of the DVD alone. I have never seen someone take so long to die in a movie.

Truck has a final showdown with Lt. Uhura during an argument she uses language a Starfleet officer would never use. Worse yet, she tries to kill our hero. Truck takes her out with his big gun. Then drives down to the police station to pick up his girlfriend again. They drive off into the sunset and the movie ends.

Because of the first rate acting Truck Turner is a cut above your standard blaxploitation movie. It ranks right up there with Shaft as one of the best films of the genre. Isaac Hayes is great as Truck Turner playing him as tough and cool on the streets but still tender and sensitive when with his woman. Yaphett Kotto does a solid job as Harvard Blue, the pimp. Nichelle Nichols is the real star of this film. She shows amazing acting range playing a character that is the polar opposite of the dignified Star Trek communications officer she portrayed a few years earlier. She gives such a great performance here; I didn't know it was her until I looked at the ending credits! Nichols performance is worth the price of the DVD alone, as is seeing some of the crazy 1970's pimp suits on Harvard Blue and Gator.

155792,4,0792842006,"Isaac Hayes plays an ex football star turned bounty hunter named Mac ""Truck"" Turner. After he and his partner kill a violent pimp named ""Gator"", all the pimps get together and a contract is put out on Truck by none other than Gator's woman (Star Trek's Nichelle Nichols). When all the little fish fail to kill Truck, the biggest pimp of them all, Harvard Blue (Homicide's Yaphet Kotto) makes an offer to have it done but for a big price. Does he succeed? What do you think?
Director Johnathan Kaplan's (Unlawful Entry) ""Truck Turner"" is a great part of the blaxploitation genre and of action films in general. Isaac Hayes makes a great action hero and I wish he had made more films like this. Isaac and his band also provide for one of the funkiest soundtracks ever, maybe more funky than the one he composed for ""Shaft"". The film is exciting from beginning to end and Truck finds time to romance his lady and to make some jokes in between. One of the funniest scenes is when Truck and his partner go to pick up a prisoner from a military base and they have to break through the check point. When the security guards start shooting at Truck's car, he hopes they shoot his left tire out because he needs a new one real bad. Guess what, not only do they shoot the left tire out but they have to put the new one on for him! The rest of the time you will be laughing when you hear all the words that Nichelle Nichols has learned since she was Lt. Uhura on Star Trek!

155793,4,0792842006,"When I bought this DVD, I was expecting a run-of-the-mill blaxploitation movie.  It turned out to be much more!  Isaac Hayes is smooth & tough as Truck Turner, a no-nonsense bounty hunter.  I'm surprised that Hayes didn't a make many more movies like this.  He's more interesting than some of the better-known blaxploitation stars.  I'd rank this near the top of the heap (a notch or two below movies like SHAFT and ACROSS 110th STREET).  This is a great choice if you're looking for a good shoot-em-up . . . with an attitude!",1016668800,10,526,4.602150537634409
155794,4,0792842006,"Issac Hayes carrying the whole weight of an action film alone?  A film starring HIM???  At first I thought it's ridiculous.  Well, he is a great singer, but ....  Then I watched this film, and twice, and am convinced.  He should do that more!!  Yes, I acknowledge he cannot act like DeNiro or Pacino, and the story of his love interest is as convincing as love between Josh, Ben, and Kate in ""Pearl Harbor.""  But given a right material like this, his towering physical presence makes up for anything single-handedly.
Truck Turner is an ex-football player, and now a bounty-hunter.  With his partner Jerry, nothing can stop them.  Nothing.  If you are disliked by him, pray it ends soon -- because his huge fists are flying to you right in the face!  But one day his botched job getting a guy named Gator leads to his being THE most wanted man for the gangsters.  They attack him, his office, and his room even, but now it's Turner's turn to pay back!!!
Frankly, the film is too violent, and one scene made me cry ""Oh, PLEASE!  DON'T HANG THAT!""  But Hayes is well-cast and credible as a no-nonsense bounty-hunter, and actions are good.  But the most memorable is Nichelle Nichols's ""madam,"" whose foul-mouthed acting completely shatters the good old memory of ""Star Trek"" fans.  (Where did our Uhula go?  Or, is this what she really wanted to do?)  Another impressive point is director Jonathan Kaplan, who sometimes gives strong emphasis to darker nuance of his direction (maybe overdirection, some say) later seen in his Jodie Foster film ""The Accused.""  The fate of Yaphet Kotto is captured in a very bleak way, which reminds us of Christopher Walken in a very violent noir ""The King of New York.""
Though I don't share the enthsiastic praise of other reviewers, ""Truck Turner"" is a great action film, which is raised higher one notch above than average blaxploitaion films.  If there should be a sub-genre like ""bounty-hunter movies,"" this comes to the top alongside with more comical ""Midnight Run.""
If you don't know the details of bounty-hunting and bailbonding, you may not enjoy the film fully.  In that case, you might as well see Trantino's ""Jackie Brown,"" in which another icon Pam Grier showcases her great talent as the title heroine.",1016236800,,2247,4.769430051813472
