753013,4,6303978177,You know I keep getting these requests for a review but I haven't reviewed the product due to my VCR eating tapes consequently it's broken & I need to get another one before I try the newly purchased tape. I assume the purchase is in top shape. Most everything I've bought through Amazon has been as expected so I have no reason to suspect otherwise here. I just will have to send in an actual review on the product on my time after I get another VCR. Could be a week a month or who knows? It's actually for my little grandson when he comes for his weekend visit with his dad.,1306368000,,576,4.151785714285714

753015,5,6303978177,"This intensely comic film is completely unknown to the North American public.  The hilarious scenes abound; at a certain point, you feel overwhelmed by laughter.",1284940800,4,161,5.44
753016,4,6303978177,"I teach the Beowulf and the Odyssey. These are just about as good as you could ask for. Of course, I wish they didn't replay the kind of gross Cyclopes eating so many times...but that is what you get when the commercials are gone and someone recaps. Leaves out some of the more religious/mythical ideas because it works very hard to interpret everything as a scientific fact, which I think leaves out some of the beauty, but I would much rather show the kids it wasn't all ""just made up"" and add the religious back to it. With a whole season on the DVD, it was quite deal. I bought it and shared it with the whole department.",1284336000,3,625,4.305084745762712

753018,5,6303978177,"Ancient Monster Hunters is an excellent documentary which sheds light on the monsters of antiquity and draws a connection between archaeology, paleontology and mythology.
The amount of effort and research put into this project is evident and as a result the documentary helps transport the viewer to another time allowing one to lay eyes on mythical monsters such as griffons and centaurs.
Very well written and very well presented, this documentary is guaranteed to provide the viewer with significant knowledge regarding well known creatures of legend and how they came to be part of art, lore, and religion.
In short, Ancient Monster Hunters is strongly recommended to all those with a soft spot for Ancient Greece, archaeology, paleontology and mythology. 5 Stars",1217894400,5,767,5.295081967213115

753205,2,6303978177,"Very entertaining -- a cute and sexy movie without nudity -- very Italian. Unfortunately, enjoyment of the film by me was marred by poor recording quality with several seconds at various points being completely unintelligible (both video and Audio). The recording originated in Korea from where I've not made a purchase before. This makes me pretty leery of again purchasing a recording originating there, particularly because I missed my return window by three days and am stuck with my flawed DVD.

I hope this quality issue is a one of because the film is a hoot and deserves a wider audience. Bummer.",1412121600,,604,4.921568627450981

753208,5,6303978177,"I fell in love with Benigni humor when I saw Johnny Stecchino (Johnny Toothpick), one of the funniest movies ever. The Monster is full of slapstick humor. Fun and mayhem abound due to mistaken identity-one of Benigni's favorite themes. There was one scene that made me laugh for five minutes!",1399852800,,292,4.86
753209,4,6303978177,"Roberto Benigni is an Italian national comedy treasure.  When this film came out it had little fanfare in Amrerica because it is a minor comedy classic.  But after his success in Life is Beautiful, this was rereleased.  This shows the comedy genius of Roberto and once again costars his wife Nicolettta Braschi.

The plot is Roberto is mistaken for a serial rapist and police officer Nicoletta is sent to get the evidence on him.  Most of the plot is there to set up the great physical comedy.  My favorite is when he is leaving his apartment and to avoid the concierge, he squats and walks under the window but he is noticed by a neighbor each time and continues to walk this way even after he leaves the building to convince the neighbor that is how he walks.  It is even funnier when he gets Nicoletta to do it too.

This is for people who like Benigni's brand of comedy and it is all out comedy.

One thing for people who buy this import, it is a Korean import and when you put it in it defaults to English dub and no subtitles.  If yoiu are like me, you need to go to Set Up and change to Italian with English subtitles.  Little inconvience to own this film which at this time is not available in the US.",1397606400,2,1209,4.258771929824562
753210,5,6303978177,A great and funny movie.  The funniest misunderstanding I ever saw.  Glad I was able to get this from Amazon and can share it with family and friends.,1392595200,2,150,4.321428571428571
753211,5,6303978177,"Hilarious movie!!  The son of Peter Sellers never fails to impress.  The story line is funny in itself about a poor idiot thief who keeps being mistaken for a notorious rapist on the loose, but Roberto Benigni makes it all that much funnier.  Co-starred by his wife as usual.  You will love this movie.",1385251200,3,302,4.537037037037037
753212,5,6303978177,"I teach Middle School Latin and love to get kids to think about how humans perceive the world around themselves in any time period and culture, largely based upon what they are taught, for better or worse. It's exciting and provocative to learn about how such creatures as Cyclops and griffins may have arisen in the human mind from what we today consider paleontological remains.",1381449600,,380,4.861538461538461

753299,2,6303978177,"My 4 year old boy is going thru his monster truck phase.  I don't know how it happened, since we parents didn't expose him to them, but there you have it.  When the boy was disappointed not to be permitted to attend a local truck-a-palooza at the Pepsi Center, we offered to obtain some videos for him instead.  We chose these because of their availability on VHS (the TV we like him to use is a VHS/TV combo).

I'm sorry to report that there are tons and tons of minutes of footage interviewing drivers.  If they interviewed the drivers and had the audio playing over footage of monster trucks doing their thang, it'd have been ok, but the camera just stays trained on these drivers for minutes at a time and that part is just so boring for little kids.  Who, I must believe, are the primary target audience for this stuff.

Also this is a 3-tape set that could EASILY have been compacted onto one tape as each individual tape is only 30 minutes long.",1361577600,,952,4.375
753300,5,6303978177,If you're a Benigni fan you want this in your collection. It's hard to get this film so I suggest you buy it while it's still available from Korea. Unless you speak Italian you'll have to deal with the subtitles but it's worth it.,1358121600,,230,4.25
753301,5,6303978177,"My all-time favorite Benigni film: a veritable masterpiece: Written, Directed, Produced and Starring Roberto Benigni, who delivers a tour de force performance in a comedic style reminiscent of the greats Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, but is in no way copy-catting, but instead paying tribute to his obvious influences. Benigni's comedic timing is brilliant; the gags are whimsical, zany, and hilarious, and the story, although somewhat far-fetched, never-the-less works in the manner in which it is presented. In a nutshell, Roberto Benigni plays Loris, an opportunist and harmless shyster, who is mistaken for a serial rapist/killer. Nicoletta Braschi  (Benigni's real life wife) plays an attractive undercover police officer assigned to bring-in the notorious fiend, by using her sexuality and charms to bait and lure the sicko before he strikes again. I only wish an Art House would do a revival and present this on the big screen so I could die laughing.",1350432000,5,963,5.3355263157894735
753302,5,6303978177,"Ya gotta love Roberto! No matter how many times I watch his films I just can't get enough. His mere presence in a scene has you on the edge of your seat just wondering how soon and for what idiocy or gaff you'll be crying with laughter over next. I took a chance on this movie due to its Korean Importation but it was as advertised. It does work here in the States on Region 1 players, there are options for English or Italian Audio and Subtitles as well. I will say this regarding the audio; I tried watching the movie using several different combinations. First I went with English Audio only and it sounded and looked as bad as an old Asian Martial-Arts movie dubbed in English. I also attempted to add English subtitles to this simultaneously. This was a total fiasco my 8 yr old could have produced. I then tried Italian audio only. Obviously this was perfect as it was filmed in his native tongue though admittedly, the editing was a tad off in some places here too lol. When I added the English Subtitles it was to me perfect. Now granted, I'm first generation Italian-American but I'm not as fluent (as I should be) in Italian. That said, I noticed a good bit of ""skewed"" translation between languages which wasn't terrible but it does unfortunately detract slightly from the heightened comedy of a few situations. Someone that doesn't understand any Italian would be none the wiser as the scenes are hilarious anyway. I just wanted to be thorough in my review as I had to read alot of them before I decided to take the plunge. Lastly, I noticed while watching this movie in a number of areas it stood out to me that Roberto and his comedic stylings are so natural to him that he doesn't even have to TRY to be funny and he succeeds at it anyway. I've seen many a comic draw laughter from an audience simply through physical gestures in the past but Roberto does it with such seemingly effortlessness and so often that he no doubt would've been the most well remembered star of the silent movie era had he been working back then.

In SUMMATION... Yes this disc will play in Region 1 players, Yes it has English Audio and English Subtitles and......

YES IT'S FUNNY AS HELL! :)",1329264000,18,2184,4.4575
753303,4,6303978177,"It took me forever to find this film at a decent price. When I got it, it worked well, and I am just really happy to have this movie as it's one of my favorites. However, when I got it, it smelled like plastic and from the printing on the DVD it was really clear that the seller had printed this themselves. I'm not sure that they have the authorization to do that, but I am sure that it was printed by them.",1327881600,,408,3.927710843373494
753304,5,6303978177,"Roberto Benigni is a comedian genius without a doubt, yet many of his movies have a nostalgic and profound depth to them like ""Life is Beautiful,"" and ""Tiger in the Snow."" However, ""The Monster"" is nothing but a pure undiluted 100% comic explosion. It is NOT an exaggeration that you may as very well pee yourself laughing because you will not be able to catch your breath between the bouts of laughter :)
If you ever feel too blue to do anything else, please watch Il Mostro and simply let your brain be flooded with crazy happy endorphins :)

753305,4,6303978177,"This is one of Benigni's best movies.  It is a really good slapstick comedy.  The English dubbing is pretty bad, however.  The DVD does have the option to listen to it in Italian (so you can actually hear Benigni instead of what sounded like a Korean guy) with English subtitles, so that is good.",1319068800,,296,4.444444444444445
753306,3,6303978177,"The dvd does play in the various languages as stated. Depending on one's need or expectation though.....the English subtitles are incomplete.  I gave it as a gift to my Italian instructor, only to find out when viewing it in Italian with English subtitles (for his classes) the subtitles are incomplete. It doesn't have subtitles for all the dialogue and for each character speaking.  If this isn't a need or a factor, you will be very happy with the DVD.",1311033600,,455,4.746835443037975
