8722928,4,B010PU5UWC,One of my favourite animes. My only problem with this item is the price. Shamefully the other two are more expensive,1522713600,,116,4.571428571428571
8722929,3,B010PU5UWC,"An extremely popular license in Japan, at first an original web novel series, it is now presently an ongoing light novel series with 20 published books and counting as of 20-21-2017, this property has been spun off into multiple manga, a successful anime series, with an upcoming original anime movie for the summer of 2017.

Spun off into 3 sets, following Aniplexs usual penchant for selling, where possible, Blu Ray sets arranged into story arcs, the stage is set for the usual expense of Aniplexs sticking to the Japanese model of appealing to hardcore fans who will pay any price to get what they like. Leading to the natural question, is it worth it?

This is a visually excellent anime and one with great audio as well, for special effects, sound track and songs. It has a great supporting cast. So, is there a problem? Alas, yes.

Are you familiar with Mary Sue? Gary Stu? These are respectively the female and male derisive names come from the world of fanfiction, to describe fan author inserted characters, almost always a thinly veiled fictional version of the author, and is someone who is too perfect. A Gary Stu in the world of Sherlock Holmes would be smarter than Sherlock, Mycroft or Moriarty, combined. In the DC Universe, stronger than Superman and a better detective than Batman. In short these unbalanced characters are too smart, too strong, too good at every single thing, and usually too beautiful /handsome.

Say hello to one of the Gary Stu-est Gary Stus of all time, our hero, Tatsuya Shiba. If you want to know how not to use an over-powered character, take notes, because hes your new poster child (despite this, Tatsuya and his also problematic sister, Miyuki Shiba, were voted amongst the most popular light novel characters in Japan). Tatsuya is not just the wrong way to write an over-powered character: Hes the worst way.

Welcome to 2095, an alternate world where after WWIII, magicians have emerged from the shadows, and taken power to prevent such an event from happening again. The result is a world where Japan is controlled by the 10 most powerful magic families, led by the most powerful clan, the Yotsubas. Naturally, in such a world, there is prejudice, those who can do magic versus those who do not. But also, there is a further divide between those who excel in magic, and those who are deemed mediocre.

Of the nine magical high schools in Japan, at First Magic High arrive incoming siblings Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba. Although not twins, with Tatsuya born some months before Miyuki, they are roughly the same age. But they are on separate tracks: Miyuki is to be an Honor Student, with a bright bloom on her school uniform marking her as an elite, while Tatsuya, despite a perfect score on the written portion of the entrance exam, has no such mark, and is in the second track, those derisively called Weeds.

Except what the aptitude tests don't show is that Tatsuya is actually the single most powerful mage to ever attend the school. They just don't have tests for instantly self-healing from any injuries, for being the greatest living magical engineer, even if only a teenager, for being strong enough to create matter and detonate it. Its like the aptitude test was a shooting range for .22 caliber rifles, and Tatsuya is the Death Starwithout the exhaust vent issues. But it goes beyond that. Tatsuya and Miyuki are actually members of the Yotsuba clan, with Miyuki being the heir apparent. Oh, and Tatsuyas also a special officer in Japans Special Forces magical battalion. And of great appeal to the Japanese audience this show was intended for: Younger sister Miyuki worships the ground Tatsuya walks on. You keep expecting her to throw him to the ground and ravish him in public. Actually not that badits worse.

Set 1 covers the Enrollment Arc, introducing the main characters and much of the supporting cast, although more cast is added throughout. Theres actually a good message here about preconceived notions, as many of the Weeds who are friends of the Shiba siblings have their own unique skills which defy the label of Weed. Shortly after their arrival, both Shiba siblings are recruited by Student Council president Mayumi Saegusa, a daughter of one of the 10 clans. Mischievous, Mayumi is one of a number of splendid members of the supporting cast. Shes worth noting because she is firmly against the bias between Blooms and Weeds, and wants to end it.

Against all this, the Enrollment Arc has at its climax a group of supposedly anti-magical terrorists, with mental manipulation at work. It serves as a good opening to the series and an introduction to a remarkable alternate future world.

But theres a big problem when the hero and heroine are just lousy characters. Tatsuya is absurdly over-powered. Miyuki isn't as insanely over-powered in this arc as Tatsuya; but her obsession with her brother is just something most Western audiences don't want. Tatsuya has the beginnings of a harem by the end of this story arc, but hes not interested, much.

Great visuals, great sound, great supporting characters with a story that takes some time to get underway, it is heavily damaged by the male and female leads, especially Tatsuya, who is one of the worst cases of an authors self-wish fulfillment running amuck that you will ever witness.",1487635200,,5309,4.842337375964719
8722930,5,B010PU5UWC,"Just watched through this on Netflix so I can't speak to the set (which looks nice but pricey). Loved the series. Fun concept, great visuals, not too much fan service. Perhaps not as much character development as you'd like, but still was quite enjoyable and I watched through in a weekend, which I haven't done in a long time for an anime.",1451606400,,340,4.5
