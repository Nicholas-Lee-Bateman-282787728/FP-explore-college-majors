8520384,2,B007PK9N2E,"For those who are confused with the shadow on this dvd,. The shadow we know didn't come out until 1937 so this shadow is a story teller but did in fact was in the same radio show and magazine. The Dick tracy episode should have been in the other dick tracy dvds",1500768000,,261,4.038461538461538
8520385,3,B007PK9N2E,"This would've been a bit better if they had actually used four TV shows instead of two shows and two shorter movies. When you see Ralph Byrd on the cover, you assume it will be the Dick Tracy detective show when it says ""Lost Detective Classics"". This disc has the Shaky episode, with Dabs Greer as Shaky, which is available on nearly every DVD that has the Dick Tracy TV show on it.

The Shadow: House of Mystery is both very dull and very short. And the Shadow only narrates (as a shadow). Not much acting or story. Good only for a historical look.

The episode of the Hunter was ""The Ghost Heads East"" and is the best part of the DVD, featuring the lovely Nita Talbot. Barry Nelson plays a spy/adventurer named Bart Adams in the series. Very reminiscent of Foreign Intrigue or Passport to Danger.

The Private Eye is based on the racist work of Octavus Roy Cohen, and seems to be have produced for the African-American theatre circuit (or a TV station). It has the best production values of the entire DVD, but it's really hard to watch. There are some legitimately funny bits in it, but be prepared to cringe a lot at the portrayal of black folks; some writers don't believe there's anything more to black culture than Amos and Andy.",1468800000,,1237,4.464601769911504
8520386,3,B007PK9N2E,"Not too bad, but could have had a better selection of old movies.  I was disappointed that it was not made more clear that the ""Shadow"" was the very first films in which the shadow was nearly a narrator & not the Shadow we grow up loving from radio & t.v.",1464566400,,255,4.0
8520387,2,B007PK9N2E,Should have remained Lost,1457481600,,25,5.5
8520388,2,B007PK9N2E,I thought this would be more than what it was. It has shorts in it and they were not good at all. This is a DVD that I would not tell anyone to buy. Even the Dick Tracy one; was not that good.,1371427200,3,192,3.488372093023256
