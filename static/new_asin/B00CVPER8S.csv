8586832,5,B00CVPER8S,"Made in 2006, IDIOCRACY was uncannily prophetic & way ahead of its time. Brilliantly anticipating the Age of Stupid, it accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of finding abundant, if grim, humor in the bleak future being crafted now by Trump & co: A nation full of gullible, bigoted, dumbed-down, slow-witted, low-info ignoramuses who can barely operate their TV remotes or find their mouths to stuff junk food into, let alone cope with the devastated environment in which they live.

Sounds depressing, but writer/director Mike Judge (Office Space) does a fantastic job of squeezing a surprising number of laughs, even belly-laughs, out of a seemingly bleak dystopian tomorrow-land.

IDIOCRACY is a well-produced indie sci-fi satire with great FX & a very funny script. More complex than it seems on the surface, it feels kind of like a bizarre mockumentary preview of the aftermath of the Trumpocalypse. Of course, being a Hollywood movie, it has a happy fairy-tale ending, with everyone returning to rationality, common decency and rediscovering that it's better to be smart than stupid. We should be so lucky in real life!

Funny, prophetic, disturbing & worth seeing, it might even revive your spirits enough to get you off the couch & get involved to keep this head-banging nightmare from coming true.",1490832000,3,1311,5.1745283018867925

8586834,5,B00CVPER8S,"My son was in the movie, so I watched it and then I realized recently that it was indeed more a documentary than a fantasy!  Sad times we live in, but Mike Judge nailed it before we were here!",1482537600,6,192,3.923076923076923
