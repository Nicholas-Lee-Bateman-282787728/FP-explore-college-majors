4424501,4,B004LX0LG0,"This was a great surprise. A low budget little slasher that really delivers the goods. A bizarre throwback to the slashers of the 70s and 80s complete with damaged 'film' images and sound. Very uneven mix of over the top, outrageous horror and very eerie dark undertones wrapped in lots of nudity, sex and violence. Strange mix of maybe Last House On The Left and Slumber Party Massacre if I had to compare, but it really has a feel all its own as well. I have to admit I didn't know if I even liked it at first, but after watching it 3 times I decided I did. If you are a fan of 70's grind house/drive in type stuff give it a try.",1300924800,6,631,4.096774193548387
4424502,5,B004LX0LG0,"Wow what a solid little flick! I love this genre so it's always nice to see another addition like this for my collection. I most thoroughly enyjoyed myself from start to finish. The only problem is..... There were a ton of hot girls and I will have my work cut out for me now researching all of their brief and probably naughty edgy careers. However it's the process in itself that so rewards me. A fun watch and everything I was hoping for, well worth the money.",1299456000,5,463,4.333333333333333
4424503,4,B004LX0LG0,"This ultra low budget flick is one that wears its campy style on its sleazy sleeve and is actually a lot fun if you're a fan of B-movie horror. There's LOTS of hot chicks (yes, there is also ample amounts of nudity and several softcore sex scenes), lots of tattoos on some of the girls, a decent amount of bloody kills, several creepy strangulation scenes, an emphasis on kinky imagery / bondage and 'edgy' style Burlesque dancing. The slightly grainy 'film effect' and old style 'film color' adjustments along with the authentic sounding retro music in the background achieves an effect similar to that of a 70s grindhouse movie (almost) and is much better of an effect than you usually see in movies that try it. The script is OK and isn't annoying like so many no-budget horror movies tend to be. The actors talk like real people for the most part and don't sound like they are reading directly from a script. I was never bored or felt the need to fast forward any scenes (which is rare with these kinds of movies). I don't want to give away anything by describing the storyline or kills as they are sometimes surprising and should be watched with no prior knowledge of what is going to happen. Overall this is a fun and entertaining B-Movie that is exactly what I thought it would and should be. Check it out if you like these types of movies. You probably won't be disappointed.",1298764800,11,1383,4.536
8435228,3,B004LX0LG0,"Obviously a low budget film. They did a great job except for the fact that there wasn't much burlesque dancing at all.  In the opening credits there was dancing, and I was thinking that it was going to be one of the greatest horror movies ever. Later on toward the end of the movie there is a scene where one of the actresses is dancing in front of a mirror. other than that, no dancing. Great music.",1470873600,,400,4.194805194805195
8435229,2,B004LX0LG0,"The best part of the movie is the first scene with this delectable naughty girl having sex in bed, and then getting completely naked in the bathtub while later only to be strangled. Holy cow is she delicious...naughty naughty. I was disappointed I didn't see her in the directors other movie ""Photographic?"" I'm sure if she was, that director would have another delicious role lined up for her so she can show off that tasty body again. The rest of the movie is okay, shot on a no-budget scale. There is plenty of sleaze to go around, and the girls love to take it off. Other than that, it was a movie that didn't succeed the way the girls were captured and portrayed. I can't wait for Burlesque Massacre 2 to come out and see more sleaze.",1424044800,,739,4.401459854014599
8435230,1,B004LX0LG0,"i'n only giving this one star because I can't give it zero.  This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. It's full of uncomfortably, overly-explicit and poorly performed sexual scenes, had a budget of $15, and appears to have been filmed on someone's cell phone.",1416960000,,267,4.804347826086956
8435231,3,B004LX0LG0,"This isn't even a who-dun-it. We know that John (Timothy Whitfield) and his sister Crystal (Crystal Swarovski) are the killers. She has daddy issues from which he rescued her. Now they are an item and she is required to wear pasties throughout the entire movie.

Their issues have manifested themselves into killing off strippers, of which Crystal is a dancer also. That is pretty much it, although I will say strippers like to stay clean.

3 stars for the nudity and nothing else. Bad dialog, terrible acting, stinker plot.

F-bombs, sex, and full frontal nudity. Recommend ""Strip Club Slasher"" (good luck finding it) if you liked this one.",1391817600,,641,4.916666666666667
8435232,3,B004LX0LG0,"Start with your basic nudity, add in some sex (straight and lesbian), add in some incest, and a touch of necrophilia - now start the killing spree. The incestuous relationship is the key one. Not a spoiler, it comes out fairly early in the film. They have sort of a femdom thing going on. Worth the rental.",1383177600,,306,4.385964912280702
8435233,1,B004LX0LG0,"Well the director certainly murderd this little film. Made on a shoestring where they couldn't afford decent quality fake blood. Dumb plot, crap acting and woeful special effects. Are you getting the picture? Try elsewhere.",1365465600,,223,5.4
8435234,2,B004LX0LG0,"once again the cover is way better then then film.  their is no booty like on the cover in the film. pretty dismal film at best. I didn't enjoy it all, and I will watch dam near anything.",1362873600,,187,3.9210526315789473
8435235,2,B004LX0LG0,"So my fiance and I have seen a lot of horror movies (and attempts at horror movies), to the point we're browsing what's here on Amazon. Going through the 4-star reviewed movies, we stumbled on this. Just three reviews, but all solid... might be a low-budget indie gem. Might be, but wasn't. Don't get me wrong, we've seen worse. But this is nothing to write home about, more something to write an honest review of.

Mediocre acting, clunky script. Now I never thought I'd say this about a horror movie, but it could have used less boob. Less boob and more blood. The opening held a certain amount of promise, but by the second death scene, we were skeptical. We can suffer some bad acting and low production values... we've seen some pretty low-budget ones where it was obvious they spent their money on a handful of good death scenes. This one, it seemed like an afterthought. There's a lot of strangulation, which is fine, but it's obviously about the cheapest death one can have. We decided most of the budget was spent on pasties and the gas bill from all those hot showers.

And the movie might have a great second half, but honestly, we got bored and turned it off. Bottom line, it's definitely got $1.99 worth of boobs, but literally about that in fake blood too. Again, not the worst thing we've seen. Just far from what we were expecting based on these other reviews. Really not that much burlesque, severly lacking in massacre.",1353456000,,1437,4.587548638132295
8435236,5,B004LX0LG0,"I would consider myself an unofficial expert when it comes to the ""slasher film genre"".  I have seen myriad movies that fall into this category, some great, some awful, some campy, some that weren't really slasher movies but good nevertheless.  I was very eager to see ""Burlesque Massacre"" because it falls into the sub class of slasher movies which are ""Massacre"" films.  The best way I can simplify these types of movies is by using a rudimentary equation; take the first word(s) in the movie title and just know that the plot will focus on a massacre surrounding that term, in this case ""burlesque"".

This movie is homage to 1970s/1980s exploitation horror films, utilizing all of the classic staples of the genre yet providing some modern twists.  The plot is that a bunch of girls whom are burlesque dancers decide to take a couple days off at one of the dancer's home to relax and practice for their next show.  It isn't long before these girls start meeting their demise.  There is a little more to it, not much but I believe the less said the better.

This film is very low budget and in no way shape or form is going to win any major awards.  In contrast, I found it to be gritty with a tongue in cheek vibe that is very honest to the source material, which is to exploitation horror.  The film makers even distressed the footage and provided ""cigarette burns"" to the movie it give it an aged effect.  The acting was believable yet amateurish; I found this to give the movie charm.  The special effects were decent and the gory was plentiful. Even the dialogue seems rather candid.

I must stress that there is a great deal of female nudity and sexual content.  This didn't bother me; it really reinforced the old horror films of yesteryear.  However, the level of nudity and sexuality was very close to soft core pornography.  Notwithstanding, in many aspects the sexual content is also a ruse for a plot device.  This is just a friendly warning to anyone who is turned off by gratuitous female nudity.

Overall, I really loved this movie and I took it at face value, a sleazy little horror flick that recaptures the nostalgia of horror films 30 to 40 years ago.  It is very entertaining and the production company really seems to know what they were doing given what they had to work with.  I'd like to see more recent movies that have this same vibe.  As for the DVD-R, it worked fine having clear audio and picture.  There is no special features or subtitles just the flick. This movie gave me hope for the future of independent horror movies.",1335139200,13,2556,4.559210526315789
8435237,2,B004LX0LG0,"Burlesque Massacre is yet another disappointing horror movie that isn't much of a horror movie at all. It has far more nudity than anything that even resembles terror. I like T & A in horror movies just as much as the next guy, but it should be used sparingly. When it's the front and center of a horror movie, that's when there is a problem. That's when you know that the makers of the film didn't have much of a story or script, and so they put as much nudity in there to try to distract from it. Burlesque Massacre is more for the skinemax crowd than the horror crowd.",1301097600,8,571,4.2
