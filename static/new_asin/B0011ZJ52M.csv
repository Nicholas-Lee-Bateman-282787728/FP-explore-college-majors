The video is well done, and easy too follow. Since exercise is important for those with Parkinson, this video offers encouragement about movement even if you are having a problem with some of the suggested exercises.
I highly recommend this video.",1381190400,2,352,4.883333333333334

3070761,5,B0011ZJ52M,"My husband is in the early stages of Parkinson's Disease. His neurologist suggested that he begin these exercises & also that he begin riding an exercise bike, set on no resistance, 80-90 RPM, for at least 15 minutes, 6 days a week (this is an exciting study that is proving to help relieve some PD patients' symptoms)

My husband has since learned that he didn't need the DVD. The book's photos and instructions are clear enough for him to understand. If you'd rather watch & exercise along, the DVD is the best choice for you.

The DVD is nice because the exercises are performed outside. You can follow along with David Zid, a professional fitness instructor.  When David Zid researched exercise & PD, he found only a few basic exercises had been designed for the PD patient. He knew that he could help PD patients and developed this exercise plan.

Exercise Options
This book is broken down into several sections. I'll try to summarize:
Wake Up Call, Walking & Balance Drills, Cardiovascular Exercise, Strength Training --Workout with weights, Non-weight (Core) Days--. Facial & Voice Exercises, Night Time Stretching.

The exercises are broken down into levels of difficulty:
~~~Level A - performed in a seated position, the basic exercise which everyone should be able to accomplish no matter their PD severity.
~~~Level B - tougher than A. More balance & stability is needed; some exercises may be performed in the standing position if applicable to your level.
~~~Level C - is the hardest. Good balance, stability, and hand mobility are needed.

The morning and evening exercises take about 15 minutes each. The other exercises take 45 min to an hour for my husband to complete.

Because my husband is in the early stages of PD, he's not sure how much the exercises are helping him, but he knows it can't hurt. PD is progressive, but can be greatly improved with an exercise routine.

So far, they're LOVING this DVD.  They were surprised that it contains 90 minutes of material.  They're delighted that the tape shows the exercises as being performed outdoors.  I can already tell that dad's flexibility and balance are improving.
