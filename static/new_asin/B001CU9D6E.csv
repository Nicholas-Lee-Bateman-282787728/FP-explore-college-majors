8289468,2,B001CU9D6E,"Good telling of the early formation of this Swedish car/truck company, but I missed the part about the explaining o the word ""Volvo."" And then this history rushes through their best car ever, the Volvo 240. The 240 made Volvo it's name in safety and reliability. But they gave the crappy 740 more time.
The 140's were an advance, hampered by a push-rod motor pulling a LOT of car. The 240's were/are the perfect Volvo built with integrity; with a proper timing-belt motor, fuel injection, and an interior that held-up.
The 740 series was Volvo's first step backwards, into crappy designs and builds, in a Modern Capitalist world of ""we don't care"" construction. No integrity as in the Volvo 240, but with the same motor. The 740 has shown to not hold-up over time, mostly in its interior, and some-what in its suspension. 740s fall apart, while most 240s are still all-together, and this film tells nothing of this truth.
I've been working on 4-cylinder Volvo's for 17 years, and I know more truth than this film can allow.
They just gloss over the 240; WTF?",1445385600,,1058,4.693548387096774
8289469,5,B001CU9D6E,"Good historical overview, but it ends in the late 1990s--the 850 model is new, and the V70/S70 are not even mentioned, let alone the company-saving XC90.  As well, good data on the P1800, but they failed to mention the fuel-injection system for the 1971-3 1800E and especially the iconic 18000ES which was reprised recently in the short-lived C30 line (the glass in the back window hatch!).",1429574400,,390,4.909090909090909
8289470,3,B001CU9D6E,"The information and history was interesting and in-depth, but more or less ends with the 850 series in the mid-90s.  I didn't realize it was quite so dated (probably should have read the description more carefully! :-)",1372896000,2,218,4.891891891891892
8289471,5,B001CU9D6E,"This is a pretty good documentary of the history of the Volvo car company.  Few mistakes here and there with the narrative not matching the vehicles shown in the film. Just a few, mind you, but there non the less.  I wish they would have spent more time on the early cars and on the development of the 140/240 models. This is the ONLY documentary I know of about Volvo so I hate to be too critical. If you love Volvos you WILL enjoy this film. It would have taken so little to make it perfect though.",1362009600,2,500,4.144329896907217
