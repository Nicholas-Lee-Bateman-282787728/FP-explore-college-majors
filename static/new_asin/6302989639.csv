Yet I didn't understand what these characters were about until I discovered this Saturday morning cartoon show, which I really enjoyed. It's like a pre-""Toy Story"" series of without too much of a concern about being caught out of position by any humans. The Raggedys' arch nemesis is Cracklin the wizard. I mostly remember his big nose and pet hair allergies. In a way, he reminds me of General Grievious from ""Star Wars"". A tough villain, but not too threatening or freightening. Which makes him all the more interesting. There were a couple of times when Cracklin tries to get the hair of a dog and targets Raggedy Dog for it. Hello. Raggedy Dog is made out of yarn. You can't get any dog hair from him. Cracklin's henchmen, Tic and Tac, are hilarious. Although it's difficult to tell them apart. There's not even one difference between them. Heck, even Flotsam and Jetsam from ""The Little Mermaid"" had one tiny difference. Hint: It's in the eyes. Overall, I think it's a great show for fans of all ages filled with adventure and enchantment.",1246752000,6,1098,4.664948453608248
532215,4,6302989639,"I think it's a nice introduction to characters that you don't hear much of anymore. We got it for our 3 yr. old for Christmas. She asks to see it almost every day ever since Christmas, 2 weeks ago. However, my 16 year old son was jokingly saying that it was scary or violent in some scene in the video but, it wasn't anything you don't see in all other cartoons now a days. I like it.",1199664000,4,384,4.0
532216,4,6302989639,"Cute cartoon..short cartoon,get it if you truely love Raggedy Ann & Andy! If not you might be just a tiny bit disappointed. The cartoon is really short. But of course kids will love it!",1172102400,,185,4.470588235294118
532217,1,6302989639,"This video is too scary for young children.  Raggedy Ann is about adventure and a pretend world, helping others and fantasy, but this video depicts mean and deceptive personalities threatening the good characters - not characteristic of the original Raggedy Ann stories. When young children hide and don't want to watch it, that's indicative of the quality.",1061337600,3,357,5.2631578947368425
7833846,3,6302989639,"Ok, wasn't as cute as I thought it would be. My little niece didn't like it.",1526083200,,76,3.8125
7833847,5,6302989639,"This is a cartoon version of several Raggedy Ann and Andy stories.  I gave it to my mother as a gift, because she has always loved Raggedy Ann and Andy.  She now has Alzheimer's, but she remembers these two characters.  I also gave her two Raggedy Ann and Andy books and the dolls.  I gave her one of the dolls to hold while she watched the cartoon, and she was thrilled.

The quality of the cartoons is excellent.  I was concerned because when the DVD came, I heard it rattling around inside the box.  However, when I looked inside the shipping box, the DVD box was still perfectly sealed.  The DVD itself turned out to be completely fine, and it plays superbly.  Having never seen any of these cartoons myself before, I was impressed that they were fun and interesting, with some heart-pumping action in some scenes.  I think the villains are a bit scarier than in most cartoons now.",1432339200,,885,4.475
7833848,5,6302989639,"I remember watching the Raggedy Ann and Andy cartoons as a little girl... then I'd try to sneak in to see if my dolls were alive, too. (LOL) Watching them as an adult brings back good memories, memories I hope to share one day with my future grandchildren (since my kids are adults now).",1394928000,,287,4.333333333333333
7833849,5,6302989639,"I didn't see this late-'80s series when it originally aired. In recent times, I became familiar with it through several VHS releases (as well as a couple of DVD compilations). As an avid fan of non-violent cartoons with a nice element of fantasy, the show is right up my alley.

This particular volume, 'Little Chicken Adventure,' is probably my favorite of all of the volumes released. (Note that the episode does not appear on any of the DVD collections.) The story line deals with the Raggedy's befriending a Native American boy who is chided by his tribe for not being brave enough. He must prove his strength by riding a unicorn. Along the way, the Raggedy's help himonly to be blockaded by unicorn ""rustlers"" who are on a mission to de-horn them and sell their magical wares for profit. A hilarious premise? Yesand that's why it's so much fun!",1382486400,,849,4.697986577181208
7833850,3,6302989639,"This one is ok but I don't care for it as much as I do the Halloween one - The Pumpkin That Couldn't Smile.
It's a real cute one.",1359158400,,129,3.4827586206896552

7833852,5,6302989639,"this is an all around good kids movie, it took me back to when i was a kid and used to watch this show. they loved it",1319500800,,117,3.3703703703703702
7833853,5,6302989639,"The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy is a great cartoon first shown on CBS around 1988. It's fun for fans of the dolls or for fans of 1980s animation or if you're just a fan of animation period. The animation is bright and colorful and the picture on the dvd is crisp. The program shows friendship, togetherness, adventure in every episode, there aren't a lot of cartoons of this quality shown on television today. Enjoy it as a kid at heart, or show it to your kids, they'll love it. There is one other volume available and I wish they'd release the complete series, I'll be the first to buy it. The theme song is catchy also! Bring on more!

Update for 2014: New World Video is releasing 3 single dvd releases of Raggedy Ann and Andy with 4 episodes on each disc on May 13th, if you want to get the best deal on May 13th 2014 the same date as the single releases they're releasing a 3 disc set at 300 mins. It doesn't say yet if it will just be the 3 single discs gathered into one set or it will be the complete series which was 13 episodes. The 3 single disc sets have 4 episodes which total 12 episodes. No need to pay the high prices for the out of print older dvd versions.",1271376000,2,1182,4.139130434782609
