8540865,5,B009F7R5D4,"Max Lucado confronts head-on the different fears we all have that determine who we are as a person.  When we understand and confront these fears by faith in God, we become a more effective Christian.  The accompanying video, with Max Lucado speaking, gives a much greater insight into each lesson.  The DVD-based study is dependent upon first having read the appropriate chapter in the book ""Fearless.""  The ""Fearless"" book has fifteen chapters of which only six are covered in the DVD-based study.  What a shame!  I truly wish Max covered all 15 chapters.  It's that good.",1371254400,,573,4.90625
