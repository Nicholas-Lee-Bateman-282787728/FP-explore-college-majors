7039199,4,B00UGQDDCA,"Blade Runner: The Four-Disc Collector's DVD Edition has four slightly different versions of the film and every feature you would want to see about the movie EXCEPT for the fifth version of the film known as the ""Work Print"". The work print is available along with everything else from this set in other 5 disc sets. I love this set and would have given it 5 stars if it also had the work print. My recommendation is if you can buy a set which includes the work print for about the same price as this set, you should get that instead. If you're not the type who needs EVERYTHING, this is an awesome set and you will be happy with it.

If you have never seen Blade Runner or you have only seen the Original US cut, below is the order I recommend watching all the versions of the film along with the other DVD's in this set:

Disc 3: US Theatrical Cut (1982)

Disc 3: Director's Cut (1992) This version is without the happy ending or narration over the film

Disc 2: Dangerous Days: a 210 minute documentary on the complete making of Blade Runner (and every minute is worth watching)

The Work Print (Not included in this set)

Disc 4: Enhancement Archive: Has many features including nearly an hour of deleted scenes

Disc 3: International Theatrical Cut (1982) Basically the US version with a few extra seconds of added violence (My favorite version)

Disc 1: The Final Cut (2007) Almost the same version as the Director's Cut but has some great tweaks and is a very clean film",1490054400,11,1476,4.440740740740741
7039200,5,B00UGQDDCA,"This edition of ""Blade Runner"" includes all four versions of the film (the original theatrical cut, the international theatrical cut, the 1992 director's cut, and the 2007 final cut). There are also making-of documentaries for the fans. The inclusion of the various cuts is nice for students of film as they can compare the changes and Ridley Scott's directorial intent. Unfortunately, only the 2007 final cut is up to modern high-def standards, but the others are watchable on a regular DVD player with no noticeable loss of quality. Those looking to get a copy of the original before the sequel debuts in theaters should consider this set.",1486684800,38,641,5.0

7039203,1,B00UGQDDCA,"It is nice that Warner Bros made all of the versions of Blade Runner available, or more to the point, rereleased the original US theatrical cut, but they only remastered the ""Final Cut"" to make it look super pretty on Blu Ray. So if the original version is your favorite, your choices are either watch the pretty one, or watch the good one. Not both.",1483747200,16,350,4.4

8706465,5,B00UGQDDCA,"Pretty much any version you want is on here, theatrical, director's cuts and the Final Cut. I love the theatrical, I hear the V.O. regardless (it's a noir requirement) but the final cut makes sense, and  is a the best version after all.",1519430400,,236,4.488372093023256
8706466,5,B00UGQDDCA,"I never thought I'd find this! Totally worth it. It has every version of the film that matters, including the Workprint version. Plus, everything you ever wanted to know about Blade Runner, including all those things you didn't yet realize you wanted to know. The packaging and bonus goodies inside are just icing on the cake.",1517011200,,326,4.839285714285714
8706467,3,B00UGQDDCA,It's alright. I can see why a lot of stories reach back to Blade Runner for inspiration. There was a ton of world building done in this movie. Unfortunately they never really did anything with it. Going to check out the book and see how that goes. This movie is worth a watch if for no other reason than you get to see where other movies and games get their inspiration.,1513728000,,370,4.225352112676056

8706473,5,B00UGQDDCA,"One of them must be ""Blade Runner in its many varied and excellent versions. This film is what sci-fi is all about. Instead of wasting time on gratuitous blood squirting, the story is much deeper with not only a message but a question.

""Early in the 21st century, the Tyrell Corporation advanced Robot evolution into the Nexus phase - a being virtually identical to human - Known as `Replicant.'""...Replicants were used Off-world as slave labor ...Replicants were declared illegal on earth ...Special police squads - Blade Runner Units - had orders to shoot to kill ...""

This was not called execution.
It was called retirement.

The film from beginning to end is treated with an overlay of original musing by the renowned Vangelis. In many films music can be a distraction or is needed to enforce spooky scenes. In this film the music is more of a co-character.

One image that staid with me is of Daryl Hannah with her fancy eye shadow.

It is now possible to see the many variations of this film based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep"" by Philip K. Dick.",1496966400,4,1075,4.666666666666667
