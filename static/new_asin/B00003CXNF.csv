1304650,1,B00003CXNF,"i saw this terrible movie when it came out in theaters about a year ago. It was so bad, i almost walked out. It is a shabby attempt at an action flick, starring COMEDIAN Jamie Foxx. I don't understand why hollywood producers see fit to pull perfectly good comics like Jamie Foxx into serious action roles. The story is stupid, and very generic (i.e. everyday goof off gets pulled into extraordinary/overproduced action sequences, while washed up detective hatches a zany scheme to try and use him to catch a supervillain, while constantly threatening to throw him out of the operation even though he can't function without him)...Does that about sum it up? The villain of the movie is PATHETIC. And to top it off, he repeatedly engages in strange, unexplained activities--(Jamie enters his apartment only to meet the villain; small child in one arm, pepper spray in the other and is disabled by the spray--c'mon!! They couldn't think of a better kidnapping scene than that?? Anyway, the point is, DO NOT buy this. If you do, you are supporting the ever growing wave of recycled entertainment that is spit out of hollywood.",1005004800,3,1122,4.848958333333333
1304651,4,B00003CXNF,"This is a prime example what a good movie should be!!I actually would have rated it a 4.5, but the ratings only come as whole stars. An excellent combination of action,humor and plot,Bait excels at keeping your attention and maintaining a jog along pace right up to the end. Plus,it lacks the excessive profanity usually found in a lot of toadys action flicks,so this movie gets a thumbs up as a great family movie. The only downside is its portrayal of cast in stereotypical roles,(something enemy of the state,another great movie,did not do.)All in all,this a great movie that can be watched numerous times without ""getting old.""",997401600,,631,4.906542056074766
1304652,5,B00003CXNF,"When this movie began, I could not imagine where it was going.  There seemed to be two movies in one.  There was the movie with Jamie Foxx with his usual clownish antics; and there was a movie with a very serious deadly villain.  The sharp contrast was enough to keep me watching.  Amazingly, the two storylines blend well.  The movie was funny and full of action.  The plot was not overdone or predictable like so many movies these days.  Jamie's character is lovable and intelligent.  The actor who portrayed the villain in this film was brilliant and believable.  I hope to see more of him in future.  I would also like to see Jamie Foxx in more action flicks.",988156800,2,663,4.495798319327731

1304655,3,B00003CXNF,"Let me first say that I love Jamie Fox.  I was expecting a sorry plot line that would rely on a couple of special effects and Jamie Fox humor.
Instead I got a cross between ""Enemy of the State"" and ""Booty Call"".  Don't get me wrong...it's not as funny as ""Booty Call""; nor is it as sophisticated (technology-wise) as ""Enemy of the State"".  It has a nice mix of both however.  If you try not to overanalyze some of the computer stuff (which does play a big part) and just enjoy Jamie Fox as having more to offer than just comedy you'll like this movie.
Antoine Fuqua's style is very familiar and I had a lot of flashbacks to his previous work in ""Replacement Killers"" with Chow Yun Fat and Mira Sorvino.
I was entertained by this movie and you will be too IF you don't think too hard.  Enjoy.  I'd give it a B- (81/100)",980208000,,818,4.211538461538462

Truth is, it bombed there, and i do not think that anyone will remember it by the time it hits video and DVD. this film is essentially just a retread on hundreds, literally hundreds, of films that have come out since film was invented. This film does something that few could do this year, make me a little sad that film was invented. Bait is so painfully unfunny, uninteresting, and unintelligent that any viewer will feel ripped of when walking out of the theater or from returning the video. Jamie Foxx may be the future of comedies, seeing as his other film, Held Up, did so incredibly well. What is that? You do not remember Held Up? Oh, that could be due to the fact that it was in theaters for about a day, then was dumped to give an extra theater to Thomas and The Magic Railroad.

1305205,4,B00003CXNF,"When Jamie Foxx is on his game there's nobody better at the action/comedy/thriller. Admittedly, he's been more appreciated for his serious work - but I've always been a fan of the comedian, not the dramatist. It's a very select and small handful of actors that can switch gears on the fly. So many try - so few succeed.

Without question Foxx is a standing member.

This very enjoyable production has Foxx playing Alvin Sanders, an unsuccessful petty criminal who happens to share a prison cell with a guy who has a very big secret: Where $40 million  dollars in stolen federal gold is hidden. The twist here is that his cellmate stole all that precious metal from his former partner in crime. Unfortunately for Alvin, said former partner is a genuinely scary freak; a computer genius who also happens to be a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer. And said freak will stop at nothing until he gets his gold back. Absolutely nothing.

Compounding Alvin's problems - a fierce federal officer, who has spent years tracking down the psycho, decides the best way to catch him is a trap. And that ""Mr. Jumbo Prawn"" is going to be the bait for the big bad wolf.

Kudos to the many supporting actors who are top-notch in their respective roles: David Paymer, Nestor Serrano, and the always enjoyable goofy friend in Mike Epps. And I'm always truly amazed to see how David Morse has transformed himself - honestly one of the most stunning 180' degree flip-flops in Hollywood history. Maybe even exceeding the career switches of Humphrey Bogart and Leslie Nielsen.

Cleverly plotted, crisp cinematography, movie-believable special effects and actors who can play their roles convincingly = a well made flick. Wish they were all like this, but then Foxx can't be in every action/thriller can he?",1306108800,,1782,4.8841059602649
1305206,5,B00003CXNF,"This movie is one of my favorites.  Jamie Foxx is great, but the movie is stolen by Doug Hutchison.  He is one of the best underrated, underused actors of today.

1305208,4,B00003CXNF,"In New York, Alvin Sanders is a small-time thief who's just been hauled in for stealing a bunch of prawns (shrimp) from a local restaurant. He ends up in a cell with John Jaster, one half of a high-tech criminal team that's just stolen $42,000,000 worth of gold from the Federal Reserve. Realizing that he could die at any moment from his worsening heart condition, Jaster tells Alvin to relay a cryptic message to his wife about the whereabouts of the hidden gold. Alvin doesn't know exactly what the message means, and Edgar Clenteen, the U.S. Treasury investigator working the case, hopes it will lead to the gold or Jaster's partner Bristol, but it does neither. Eighteen months later, Jaster is dead, and both Clenteen and Bristol are still looking for that gold. I liked the movie. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done.

1305210,4,B00003CXNF,"I am amazed at how this movie has a low average(3 stars?) when there are crappy movies averaging 4 and 1/2 stars and 5 stars on Amazon. The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie was suspect. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...

Story: Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.

Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.

The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.

All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something. Bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.

1305213,5,B00003CXNF,"My first introduction to Bait (2000) was on cable while visiting my parents. The movie had already begun. I came in on David Morse's character (Edgar Clenteen) violently grilling Robert Pastorelli. What follows is a Jamie Foxx solo comedy routine that kept me invested in the rest of the film until its resolution. Alvin, Jamie Foxx character shows a little compassion toward Robert Pastorelli while Edgar Clenteen (Morse) tunes him up for the upcoming interrogation. The bravado, however misguided on Alvin's part, directed toward Clenteen in support of Pastorelli and the ensuing jostling between Clenteen and Alvin had me in hysterics. Add to this Mike Epps role as Alvin's ""something like a pimp"" brother and this becomes an enjoyable roller coaster ride.

When I finally read up and watched the whole movie I wanted a copy for myself. I could not find it in the neighborhood. An outstanding cast, great direction and a story that works on many levels for me becomes a welcome addition to a modest collection where I have titles that I view repeatedly.

Bait is a movie that I enjoy every time I watch it and I watch it often.

1305333,2,B00003CXNF,"Are you familiar with concept of children's artwork?  While it is not the greatest Picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more.  If painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child.  Typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style.  You will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles.  Well, this concept of children's artwork is how I felt about Fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film Bait.  While on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see Fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments.  If you have seen either Training Day or King Arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film Bait.  While Foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define Fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera.  Sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why Fuqua's name appears on so many ""Best Of..."" film lists.

I will never disagree with someone that Fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique.  His ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking.  I am surprised that more of Hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon.  Even in the silly feature Bait, you are witness to Fuqua's greatness.  Two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end.  In both of these scenes I saw the director Fuqua at work.  Alas, in the rest of this film, all I saw was a combination of nearly every action film created.  The likeable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in Hollywood.  We have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are Charlie Kaufmann), you cannot recreate the wheel.  It is just impossible with this genre, and it is proven with Bait.  I was annoyed with Fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film.  I was just tired of the structure, and while I hoped that Fuqua would redefine it, he did not.

Then, there was the acting.  While Jamie Foxx has never impressed me as an actor, I was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try.  I wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to Collateral.  I was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that Foxx could handle the role in Collateral.  Again, I was disappointed.  Foxx was annoying.  Not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither Fuqua nor Foxx took the time to fully train Foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot.  Instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of Foxx just trying to make the audience laugh.  Adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second.  Fuqua should have stopped this immediately.  Foxx's jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of.  Instead of character development, he would crack a joke.  Neither style worked, no joke was funny.  The rest of the cast was average.  By this I mean I have seen them all in similar roles.  They were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film.  They were pawns filling in dead air space.  Fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.

Overall, this was a sad film.  With no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand.  Foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese.  In each scene I saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues.  Are my words harsh?  I don't think so.  When you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home.  Bait contained none of these.  While I will give Fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous.  Apparently, I took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully I can stop others from taking that curious nibble.

1305335,1,B00003CXNF,"Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar for ""Ray"". Had he not been up against Morgan Freeman for ""Million Dollar Baby"" he may have deserved a second for ""Collateral"". (Though in comparison to ""Ray"" his performance there was decidedly second-rate.)I watched ""Bait"" to see what the other side of Jamie Foxx was like. There could very well be better examples of Foxx's comedic prowess, but this isn't it.

  Antoine Fuqua has gotten a bad reputation. ""Tears of the Sun"" was mediocre at best. ""The Replacement Killers"" was loud, garish, and over-the-top. That one can be forgiven given its purpose but is unworthy of priase. ""Training Day"" was uncharacteristically wonderful and it was my first exposure to his work, so I was surprised that he was so reviled. Until now, that is.

""Bait"" was shockingly violent. Sure, I've seen much worse, but they were not ""action-comedies."" Some of the images displayed here are not conducive to laughter. No big loss, there was no laughter to be had in the first place.",1114300800,2,992,4.886904761904762
1305336,1,B00003CXNF,"Great, another pointless action movie that adds nothing to a tired, been-done-to-death genre. This thriller/ action/ suspense/ comedy combo doesn`t score well and is just another endless picture that makes little sense and has a contrived, unbelievable plot to match. Director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") offers a decent cinematography and an adequate urban soundtrack, but that doesn`t mean much when the characters are little more than carboard and the plot so bland. Forgettable.",1075852800,,485,5.657534246575342

The scenes with Jamie and Mike Epps are so funny and silly you have to like this movie. It was a very interesting movie with a not too hard to follow storyline. What more do you want for 8 dollars?
This is not a phd dissertation!!! Get this movie. If like Jamie Foxx you won't be disappointed.",1053216000,13,465,4.295454545454546

1305340,3,B00003CXNF,"[Actually, my rating is 2.5 stars.]  ""Bait"" is directed by Antoine Fuqua, director of ""Training Day.""  But ""Bait"" has no tension that is generated from Denzel Washington's powerhouse acting.  Rather, this film is given more deadpan humors thanks to the star Jamie Foxx.
Lots of gold kept in the federal reserve are stolen one day, and the burglar (and killer) leaves two dead bodies behind.  The criminal is a master of electronics, getting whatever information with his skills by himeself.  Government agent David Morse (Meg's hubby in ""Proof of Life"") is called in, and arrests the partner, who alone knows where the gold is concealed.
Meanwhile, a small-time crook is arrested for stealing shrimps (or prawns ... whatever), and is kept in the same cell with another guy, who happens to be the one with the key information about the gold robbery.  And you know, they seem to be talking about something, something about the clues of the place where gold can be found.  The agent team now think of a great plan: to use this fall guy Foxx as a bait, with which they can lure the master of the crime, and get the gold back again.
With high-tech devices secretly set in the jaw, the agents follows Foxx, who, ignorant of the fact, walks and talks.  This is the best moment of the film, when Foxx tries to woo his former love again, not knowing  all the conversations of him are monitored and listened, and even being discussed among the agents.
However, as to its actions, there is little to be recommended.  Though shot with stylish images, the film offers nothing new or original as far as thrills are concerned.  And to make matters worse, the most original device used to raise the tension of the film, which comes at the end of the film, just looks contrived (and some might call nasty).
Neither funny enough, nor thriling enough, ""Bait"" is memorable only with Jamie Foxx's knacks for portraying likable fellow.  And there is better thriller of this kind, and that is ""Ememy of the State.""",1041638400,2,1991,4.689655172413793
1305341,5,B00003CXNF,"This movie bombed at the box office, probably because everyone saw ""starring Jamie Foxx"" and figured it would be all unfunny schtick and no plot (Martin Lawrence, anyone?). But I went to see it, and loved it. Yes, there are some witty one-liners in this movie, but Foxx manages to create a surprisingly sympathetic character. Just listen to the scene when he tells his girlfriend a sad story about his childhood, and you'll realize how much acting range this guy really has. In addition, the movie manages to have some exhilarating action scenes and keep the tension level high throughout. David Morse and Doug Hutchinson both give terrific supporting performances.
The picture and sound on the DVD are excellent, but unfortunately there aren't many extras. Some interesting filmmaker/cast profiles and some funny commentary by Jamie Foxx, and that's about it. Maybe if the movie had done better at the box office, the filmmakers would have thought it worth it to put more stuff on the DVD. Regardless, it's a really good movie, and well worth picking up.",1020297600,2,1055,4.966101694915254
