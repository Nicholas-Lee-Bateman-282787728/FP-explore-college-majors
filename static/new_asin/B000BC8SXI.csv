2412559,5,B000BC8SXI,"I am a woman in my fifties and I used to watch Combat! when it first aired on TV. My whole family made fun of me then and now as well for liking ""war shows."" In the end, tho, I am right. This was a groundbreaking series for it's time. Nothing ever like it had ever been aired before and it is the model for all action programs that came after. No one could portray the character of Sgt. ""Chip"" Saunders except Vic Morrow. He brings mascilinity with sensetivity and moral concicousness to the role of a lifetime. I had a girlhood crush on the character/man, in fact, I think I still do. What a man!",1190332800,42,597,4.155172413793103
2412560,5,B000BC8SXI,"I was a young man when the Combat series first appeared on television.  I spent some time in the army and realized, just a little bit, of what our troops must of gone through to survive in WW11.
I spent months looking for the series in the past several years to no avail. Then someone mentioned Amazona.com.
I really enjoy the acting of all the cast members.  I throughly enjoy the acting of Vic Morrow.  I remember seeing him in several movies. I ""hated"" him until I realized it was his character in the piece that he was protraying and not Vic.
I realize now just how good an actor Vic was.  He died too soon.
The set of tapes are just what I wanted.  Thank you for allowing me to experience Vic Morrow again.  wesley riehl",1188172800,5,725,4.255474452554744
2412561,5,B000BC8SXI,"Combat is the most realistic show ever on TV until Band of Brothers. Excellent releases for the show and interviews are superb. I have in my possesion an alternate version of ""A Day in June"" (the pilot) which has totally different opening and closing credits, the word ""Combat"" appearing from behind barb wire entanglements as the squad warily advances and no explosions as in the standard opening. The episode title and credits all have this barb wire background. Can anyone comment  on this as no one seems to know of this (aired in Toronto).

My only complaint would be the packaging. The disks tend to not stay in place all of the time. This is the only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5. My true rating would be 4.75. I would also highly recommend the book ""Combat! A Viewer's Companion to the WWII TV Series"". Get it while you can. I believe it will not always be in print and the information that it contains is very enlightening.",1137888000,82,550,4.19811320754717
2412563,5,B000BC8SXI,"I saw this series in syndication. It ran before I was born.

I loved the stories and the characters. It was truly the ""Happy"" show about WWII.

I've heard it's been edited, but if you've only seen it in syndication you'd never know it. And in syndication the shows may be cut to add more commercials as well.

The commentary's and bloopers are wonderful as well you learn so much about the show from watching those as well (The Bloopers that Tom Lowell tells are a riot)

I only wish that they could find the""Missing Christmas episode"" at ABC and release that as well.

As a baby boomer whose dad proudly served his country contributing to both the European and Pacific theatres, I treasure this series as it told the stories of our brave men and women truly fighting for world peace.  Like most returning GI's, my father, who was in the U.S. Army MAC, really never spoke about the things he saw during his time overseas.  He is gone now as is many of his fellow ""Greatest Generation"" comrades.  Although Combat! does not show the graphic carnage that comes with battle, it does show the daily emotional toll that war brought to the boots on the ground, as best as 1960's television could provide.  It reminds us that the only good thing about war is its ending.

They always start out with ""staring Rick Jason and Vic Morrow."" Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.

In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?

Still feel that Morrow was one of the most underrated actors of his generation and sad that almost all of the great (main) actors in this show never graduated to bigger and better roles after this series, however there were several famous actors; starting and later stardom, that had cameo roles in various episodes that acted superbly. Having watched this disc set several times, am still fascinated by the creativity of the directors, producers and the writers with their great camera imagery and imagination filming this classic show.

Many of the cast were military veterans.  There were almost too many guest stars to list.  It is really interesting to see these individuals in their youth and emerging stardom.  I just viewed one from season One, episode 16, with Ted Knight as a German soldier.  Mr. Knight is an example of both categories, as a youthful emerging actor and veteran with honorable service.

2412667,5,B000BC8SXI,"Just a wonderful series! An interesting story fans of this show might enjoy: a number of years ago, when teaching in Japan, I was shopping in a department store in Tokyo. There was a children's ride there with a toy jeep for young kids. What was surprising was that the theme music was from Combat! Intrigued, I asked my adult students of English the next day if they had ever heard of the show. A large number of the men knew the show well, and said it was cited in business schools as a great example for employees of small group cohesion and cooperation.

2412670,5,B000BC8SXI,"The absolute best purchase ever of this kind - it's a classic, as everyone knows, and almost all of the episodes are like little, very high quality, movies.  This was a time when they made serious, quality shows of this kind.  It's black and white character adds to its quality - and the ""transfer"" is perfect.  (The last season is, however, in color.)  The context is very thoughtful and provides many things to ponder - the sorrow of war, the many ethical dilemmas it poses, and the many facets and scenarios that occurred during the liberation of France.  Like all good, older presentations (early sixties and earlier), there is no effort to substitute senseless gore and violence on screen in order to instill in the audience the gravity and horror of a situation; like the best movies of that earlier era, your imagination is acted upon skilfully to provide what it needed to experience the reality of war.",1451865600,3,911,4.7405063291139244

2412706,4,B000BC8SXI,"One of the best drama series of the 1960s, Combat! is must-see viewing for anyone who treasures the best in classic television. This set, however, is showing its age. The series could use a fresh HD remaster, and it would be nice if the producers would release a revamped set with the episodes in the original airing order.

My biggest complaint with this new The Complete Series collection, newly repackaged and released by RLJ since their takeover of Image Entertainment, is that they simply brought forward the old Image Entertainment discs without providing any episode lists on the series sets at all. If you are looking for, say ""Hills Are For Heroes, Part I,"" you would have to get lucky, or just happen to know that it's on the fifth disk of the Season 4 set.

That said, the extras (commentaries, radio interviews, documentaries, photo galleries) are informative, nostalgic, and a lot of fun. The series had a few misses, but overall Combat! is hands-down the best war drama ever produced, so I recommend this set heartily on those merits at the very least.

As an adult I was seeing the series in an entirely different light than when I was 11 years old.  The stories are captivating.  I am not a big fan of gore, which real war is full of, and more recent productions of war are difficult for me to watch.  This is sufficiently sanitized for me so my stomach does not turn,  yet still can appreciate the great sacrifice and bravery of the men who fought in WWII.  I  thought the price was very reasonable for a five year season (back then they did not just do 13 episodes and then reruns forever!)  There are also many special features and interviews that give great insight into the actors and production.  Very happy I purchased it.

Rick Jason as Lt Hanley personifies the junior officer on the front lines, following and giving orders with a sense of duty.  The platoon regulars do their jobs well.  Teamwork and interpersonal relationships are featured.  Stories and plots are entertaining and relevant to the genre of the WWII US Army action in France.

2412798,5,B000BC8SXI,"Finally!  Before anything else, there was ""Combat""!  A lot of war movies have tried to capture the grit and drama of the regular fighting Joe but though they may be truly remarkable nowadays, all those experiences were captured in the weekly adventures of LT Hanley and Sgt Saunders, along with their regular and trusted squad members. This was raw acting at its best.  To say that these were not real-life soldiers but just plain (and not even famous) actors speaks of the believability by which each episode is brought to life in front of your screens and the incredible effort placed on their shoulders to make the best wartime picture of all.  I've heard of fellow cadets in ROTC back in the 70s trying to put into practice the ""tricks"" they learned from watching this show into practice during their field training exercises.  I can't say enough about this series.  Go buy it and have it as part of your collection now!",1424390400,,924,4.672839506172839

2412800,5,B000BC8SXI,"Have not finished all 40 discs yet, whew!, but watching one a day without commercials is a joy.  I remembered the series when I was 9-14 years old and it played a factor in my joining the Army as a combat arms armor officer.  Not as polished as Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan (the Germans use WWII American halftracks and post-WWII American tanks, and for some strange reason WWI maxim machine guns instead of the Spandau superior machine gun) but given the limitations of the day completely succeed in depicting realistic combat.  Use of stock black and white footage from the war is a nice touch.  Just about every good actor in Hollywood appeared in the series as guest stars whether they had made their reputation yet or not.  The episodes directed by Robert Altman are gems.  I would like to know why the series ended after the fifth season.  Was it related to the Vietnam War then escalating?  A real tragedy is the untimely death of Vic Murrow sometime later, killed in a helicopter accident while filming an unrelated movie.  He was, an would have been, a great actor, al la Audie Murphy, who also died prematurely (airplane crash I believe).",1424217600,10,1159,4.642156862745098

2412855,5,B000BC8SXI,"Worth It! These shows were made just 20 years after the beginning of WWII.  They showcase real WWII equipment and gear in action. They also are a testament to the ""OLD Hollywood"" and what it was capable of producing. I grew up watching this show on what would now be called ""Prime time T.V."". Its airing time was past my bedtime and so I would sneak out of my bedroom and carefully crawl down the hall and behind the living room sofa (Commando style) to hide there with a view to the big black and white set. I was scared that I'd get caught, but I had to watch this show!  One night, while I was in my RECON position behind the couch, my dad's hand came down between the arm of the couch and the endtable...right towards my face....in his hand was a big (quarter sized) Brach's chocolate star, which he held out for me to take.

The story lines and the characters are true to life and intriguing.  The writing is first-rate, and while some of the special effects are not up to today's standards, that is part of the charm of this old series.  Plus, the abundance of actual WWII footage makes up for anything otherwise lacking in visuals.

I loved this series when it first aired, and I'm not disappointed now.  My only complaint is the episodes are not in chronological order.  Thankfully there was no underlying storyline that ran from year to year other than of course WWII.  I've read other reviews concerning the quality of the discs themselves, and other than the last two episodes on Season 1 which didn't seem to have been ""cleaned up"", I haven't had any problems whatsoever.  However, if you're one of those people who buy these collections for the ""extras""...there aren't many.  The three documentaries are pretty good, but the ""Oddities & Bloopers"" reel is nothing more than 2 or 3 production notes for each episode about its particular co-star or Rick Jason's pinkie rings or the shadow of someone in the production crew getting into the shot.

2412996,1,B000BC8SXI,"Let me start by saying Combat is on my list of top ten shows of all time....nearly at the top actually. It had great visuals and even though it was strictly fictional,it did seem to capture some of the essence of what made WW2 what it was. However this set is a disservice to the cast and crew that made it the hit it was. Its biggest selling point,besides the eps themselves,is the extras which abound in it. Interviews with the original cast and crew, cast clips from shows other than Combat,bloopers. It is hard to believe the latter exists because such things in those days were either relegated to the cutting room floor or taken home by directors or other subordinates as a private keepsakes.
Now,I do not usually read other reviews, but I must admit to glancing at a few older ones. They mention picture freezing,pixelation and the eps being short,for which no one seems to have the answer. I will address these issues and solve the mystery.
A)The eps being too short. Yes,they are. The eps in this set run about 46 1/2 minutes. That makes them all about 7 minutes too short(they didn't have as many commercials back then).
As soon as I started the first ep I thought the ""pace"" was a little quick, but didn't think anymore of it until the opening credits rolled. My spider senses tingling, I immediately checked the closing credits. I knew then I had the answer,as plain as the nose on my face....and THAT is pretty plain!
Ladies and gentlemen,through some neat electronic manipulation the makers have increased the speed of the eps. They have also totally reworked the opening credits. That is not how the opening creds originally ran. Right off the top the voice of the announcer telling us this is a Selmur production,was an obvious few tones higher than it should be. The music was also too obviously a few tones higher, AND much faster to boot. The original pace of the music was your average march speed. This new opening,and the closing music,virtually runs away,as do the background bayonets. I can cite any number of 60s shows on the market today such as Star Trek,Rat Patrol,The Andy Griffith Show,Time Tunnel,The Twilight Zone,Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,The Lucy Show,etc.etc. None of these shows were ever sped up or had any part of its show changed. It seems Selmur Productions wanted to create a new version that was more in keeping with today's show lengths/time constraints, for syndication purposes. The flaw here being that the home DVD market doesn't need the compacted show length. They could have at least created two versions,one for the TV market and one for the home market. But instead we get this....a terrible and unforgivable cheat.
B)Freezing of the picture and pixelation. Yes,it does happen...only if you do not check your discs thoroughly. Always check DVDs in low lighting. Anywhere near bright outside light and it floods the disc surface and you cannot see surface flaws as readily. I have literally gone through six sets trying to find just ONE that was without flaws and have failed in my attempts(I have bought through Amazon.ca and .com).I usually find around 6-8 discs with some type of scratch,dent,scuff or what have you on them. I just recently found the same disc in the same season(in the original and the replacement set)both scratched in the same spot. I have also found the same disc in the same season(of the original and replacement set) broken-one right in half and the other partially in the middle!!So you see,this is a set that definitely needs to be checked thoroughly or else running into these defects will cause problems on your playback.
In conclusion,other than the eps themselves(which look pretty good)and the extras,this set is one to avoid. The makers have cheated us and sped up the picture to run within a more modern time limit. This is NOT what the original looked or sounded like. And due to the fact that I have never been able to successfully find a set without more than a few ""flaws"" ,it is the straw that broke this camels back. I have no alternative but to NOT recommend this set. If you are looking for the original Combat,the way it was seen back in the 60s,this is NOT it. A big black mark goes to Selmur and Image Entertainment. The former for not caring enough about the original integrity of the show and its fans to release Combat in its original and best form. The latter for its abhorrent lack of quality control.",1403740800,20,4410,4.70633893919793

I thought it a good deal, even if it no longer has the extras offered with the original package (not sure).

My dad fought in the ETO with the 508th Airborne. On D-Day they crash-landed in gliders behind enemy lines.
He parachuted more than a dozen times over Belgium, including at the Bulge. From what I could tell,
he saw some real horrors, things that haunted him the rest of his life. And yet, dad would watch on TV
every WWII-related documentary, and he was a fan of COMBAT! and other such war series.

As a youngster I picked up his interest in this show, plus Vic Morrow was SOOOO good-looking!
So, seeing all these episodes again after so many decades will certainly be nostalgic.
Sgt. Saunders, Lt. Hanley, Caje, Kirby, Littlejohn and Doc, back again! The only aspect that got silly is
practically every week a main character was seriously wounded, but he was never sent home.

What a mind-boggling assemblage of talent (and Bobby Rydell)!
It seems everyone who was anyone (and Tab Hunter) wanted to guest on COMBAT!

Of the half-dozen series regulars, as of late June 2014 only Jack Hogan (Kirby) is still alive.
Most recently passed was Pierre Jalbert (Caje). He died at age 89 in January of this year.

2412999,5,B000BC8SXI,"Yes it does.
I am a big Combat fan, seeing as how I am into watching a lot of historical shows.  It comes off as very realistic.  I am also a big admirer of the late Vic Morrow.  He had a lot of acting and directorial talent.  I especially like the commentary episodes where the actors, directors and producers share their thoughts about working on the series and working with Vic Morrow and how generous he was in helping them with their acting.  It's a shame later on that Hollywood wasn't generous about giving him more and better roles and directing opportunities.  He is missed by a lot of people but at least lives forever in this series.  Thank you for offering it to all of us ""Combat"" fans

My favorite show as a child...can still see why.  Requires some suspension of reality, which makes it all the more special. Several examples...almost never does anyone reload or run out of ammunition, both Saunders and Kirby (with automatic weapons) seem able to hit distant targets without aiming carefully, American hand grenades never seem to explode right on target but are usually deadly, and the main characters are wounded multiple times, but never mortally.  A must for a child of the sixties, especially if there is an interest in WW2.  Believe Doc and Kirby are still with us (Caje just passed).  Thanks to them and all those who made this series, and have now brought it back to us.  Took about six months to watch.  Will start again shortly.  Highly, highly recommended.",1402963200,,955,4.9125

2413102,5,B000BC8SXI,"The ABC series Combat (1962-67) followed the adventures of a small group of American GI's who land in France on D-Day, and engage the enemy in battle for five seasons.  Producing a prodigious 152 one hour episodes, Combat remains the longest running World War II drama in television history.

Vic Morrow, who would tragically perish in 1982, during the filming of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Zone-The-Movie/dp/B00005JOJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a>, played Sergeant ""Chip"" Saunders, who's weapon of choice was usually a Thompson submachine gun.  Previously known for playing mostly heavies, Morrow became a TV icon, as the heroic Saunders.

Morrow and Rick Jason, who played Lieutenant Gil Hanley, were the only actors to appear in every episode.  Other key members in the squad were PFC Paul ""Caje"" LeMay (Pierre Jalbert), PFC William Kirby (Jack Hogan), BAR toting PFC ""Little John"" (Dick Peabody), and ""Doc"" (Conlan Carter).

Focused on the experiences and camaraderie of a group of infantry grunts, Combat was a gritty look at war, often at the frontlines.  Determination, courage, intelligence, and brutal violence, were often keys to survival.  With a predominantly male cast, the series became a showcase for some of the more notable actors of the period.  The program paid tribute to the heroic efforts and sacrifices of American soldiers during WWII, at a time when America was deeply involved in the conflict in Viet Nam.

When Combat was first released on DVD in 2004 and 2005, it was in partial season sets called ""Conflict I"" and ""Conflict II"".  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/entire-series/dp/B000BC8SXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">entire series</a>&nbsp;was also released in 2005, and currently goes for $186.96.  Full season sets, combining the ""Conflicts"", were finally released early in 2013, at a significant cost savings.

Rereleased in November of 2013, this version of Combat: The Complete Series contains the five newly released individual season sets.  Each season contains 8 DVD's, with Seasons 1 through 4 in black and white (127 episodes), and the final season (1966-67) in color (25 episodes).  Amazon's price of $57.99 (as of December 2013), is a fabulous deal, as the individual seasons are currently selling in the $23 to $27 range.  This set is ideal for those interested in getting into the entire series.  Unfortunately as often happens, those who purchased the earlier DVD releases, paid premium prices.

For a program from this period, the image and sound quality of the episodes is generally very good.  Although many of the primary cast are no longer with us, there are some pretty decent bonus materials, including featurettes, photo galleries, and commentary tracks.  With some new labels, the DVD's appear to be the same as were originally released in 2004 and 2005, so disc menus reflect the pervious ""Conflict"" format, which does not match the numbering on the DVD's.",1387065600,13,3041,5.62719298245614

I saw it for 99 bucks today at Costco and THAT is why I am writing to let folks know that as of 11/7 it is already on the shelf and barely under a hundred bucks. I have the previous edition and from what I understand nothing (other than packaging) has changed....

This show followed a small group of men throughout WW2 and while the Lt Hadley (Rick Jason) was picked to be the star , in short order Sargent Saunders , played by Vic Morrow , stole the show out from under his pretty nose and became a hero to all us kids in the 60's. Shot on the back lot in Los Angeles and featuring directors like Richard Donner and the late great Robert Altman and guest stars galore from James Coburn to Lee Marvin... this collection is essential to my DVD collection. The first seasons were all black and white with the final in Color.  In my opinion the series didn't yet run out of gas but was pulled for other reasons.  There are some fun commentaries and interesting bonus features..

This doesn't feature action and gun play that compares to the CGI films and shows of today but it had enough for us kids and really fun and interesting characters in the platoon... and as guests with really gutsy and compelling episodes.  While many of my childhood fantasy shows like The Wild Wild West haven't worn well with the years I enjoy this show very much. It isn't on the level of The Twilight Zone as an all time classic but its in the ball park for me. The prints are certainly good (better than some shows from the 80s in fact) and If you are nostalgic and wondering if you can dip back into your childhood and not be disappointed I'd say

Hold the plastic divider with the other hand and use either thumb to press down on the center. Start out with gentle pressure.

Seasons 1, 2 and 3 are the best, shown in black and white, dramatizing the emotion and realism of war. Season 5 is in color. Most of the episodes are about human drama and how war brings out the best and worst of men.  Many great actors got their start in these episodes.  Leonard Nimoy, Jack Carter, Mickey Rooney, Carol Burnett,  Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowell, Robert Duvall, Frank Gorshin, Charles Bronson, Dennis Weaver Bill Bixby, Claude Akins they are all there.

2413166,5,B000BC8SXI,"Hey Folks,

I recorded all 152 episodes of ""Combat!"" on VHS tapes when the series was shown many years ago on the ""Action Channel,"" and more recently, I recorded the series again on DVDs when it was shown on ""Me TV.""  The picture quality of my old VHS tapes is actually much better than that of my more recent DVDs, but watching shows on VHS tapes today is not nearly as convenient as using DVDs.  For several years now, I have been interested in buying the subject DVD set, but there were many customer reviews in past years which cited various problems with the set.  In the past year, the customer reviews have been virtually all positive, so I again became interested in getting the DVD set.  Wanting to get the convenience of modern DVDs as well as hopefully getting a better quality picture, I finally decided to purchase this ""Combat!"" DVD set.

When I put the first DVD and started watching the first episode, I could not believe how good the picture quality was.  I was watching it on a high definition TV, but the picture was simply much better than that of my old VHS tapes when viewed on the same TV.  If you watch a ""Combat!"" episode on ""Me TV,"" the picture quality is not anywhere nearly a good as the quality of the subject DVD set.  The picture quality of this DVD set really is remarkable.  Thus far, I have just completed watching the second season, and all of the episodes I have seen are the same high quality sharp picture.

The set consists of forty DVDs - eight DVDs per season for five seasons, four episodes per DVD, and some DVDs include additional video material.  Each DVD has one or more voice interviews with various people associated with the show, and there are also several videos of some of the actors being interviewed many years ago.  Most of the DVDs include a commentary by the director of one of the episodes featured on that DVD.  Each episode also includes notes on that episode provided by Jo Davidsmeyer and titled ""Notes, Oddities, and Bloopers.""

As some reviewers have noted, the DVDs are difficult to get out of the snap holder the first time, and you really do have to be careful as you lift up and pull each one off the snap holder.  Once the DVD is removed the first time, it seems the DVD does go back in the snap holder properly, and it is no longer so difficult to remove the DVD from that point on.

There were several old reviews which complained of poor picture quality, but this is not the case with the DVD set I bought.  The picture quality is absolutely great.  I have to wonder if the folks who had poor quality might not have purchased knockoff copies rather than an original set as advertised?

Another person stated the episodes were missing scenes because they were less than sixty minutes.  All of the episodes run about forty-seven minutes because each episode is shown without commercials.  There is even an old interview with Vic Morrow where he is asked about making a one hour show each week, and Morrow corrects the interviewer and clearly tells him the shows actually are designed to have a run time of forty-seven minutes for the one hour time slot.  This was also the case with the episodes when they were shown on the ""Action Channel""  which ran them without commercials.  Each episode was almost exactly forty-seven minutes.

It was also noted the set does not have closed captioning, and I have found this to be true thus far.  Another person said there is closed captioning, but it does not work if you use an HDMI cable instead of a three-wire cable to feed the TV.  I have not tried a three-wire cable as yet, but I hope it does work because I find closed captioning useful at times.  Remember, there was no closed captioning when this show was first aired.

One person noted there were a few episodes where the show just stopped at some point and would not continue.  Another person said he was missing all the DVDs from one of the season's box.  I also have had three episodes where the show just stopped, and I had to skip over a portion.  I wrote to the vendor about the problem and received a prompt standardized reply.  It listed some procedures to attempt to fix the problem by cleaning the disc.  At the end of the letter, it clearly stated they would replace any discs that were truly defective, and I would assume they would also replace missing discs.  Since the reply I received was a photocopy of a ""How To"" disc fix, I assume they do get some defective discs in a forty disc package.  That does not bother me as long as they do replace the discs if they are truly defective.

Did I mention the shows in this DVD package have absolutely great picture quality?  They really do, and I am truly enjoying the convenience of watching this great ""Combat!"" series with the convenience of DVDs.  The next thing I would like to do is see if I can get them to show closed captioning, and then I would like to copy the shows to a hard drive that I can connect to a TV and watch them without having to switch DVDs.

I watched ""Combat!"" when it first aired.  By the second season, I was married, and my wife and I watched each week with her brother (a WW2 infantry vet) and his wife.  It remains my favorite TV show of all time.

Best wishes,
Dave Wile",1373500800,22,5233,4.423197492163009

2413178,5,B000BC8SXI,"I remember little about Combat! when it aired starting in 1962. After all I was only 8 years old but I remember having a crush on Vic Morrow. As the reruns started airing on one of the retro stations in my area, I became a fan again and when I found out the complete series had been released on DVD I had to have it. This was given to me for Christmas and I couldn't start watching fast enough. It took me the better part of 3 months to watch all 152 episodes plus the extras and I have to say spending every night with Saunders, Hanley, Kirby, Cage, Doc and Little John almost makes them feel like family.

I was also amazed at the number of big named stars who made guest appearances in the series. Stars before they were stars.

The last season, Season 5, was shot in color and I will say the most disappointing of the lot. Gone was that gritty feel of war after watching the first four seasons in black and white. Gone too were the original writers and for me, the last season was not as good as the first four in terms of story content but it did not in any way diminish my pure admiration and adoration for the actors and the characters they played.

While watching the DVDs I became obsessed with the back story for each of these actors and found those to be just as interesting, making me an even bigger fan. Rick Jason (Lt. Hanley) has an interesting autobiography called ""Scrapbooks of My Mind"" available at scrapbooksofmymind.com which is a good read for fans. Dick Peabody (Little John) had also written a number of interesting articles, some of which are featured on combatfan.com.

Two things about the DVDs and the series are worth noting. First, they're (the DVDs) not too easy to get out of their hard plastic DVD jackets and patience will prevail here. Give them an ever-so-slight twist while pulling up when you remove them.

Second, each episode in the series is pretty much a standalone. Don't expect to see any cliffhangers at the end of each season and don't expect to see a series finale on the last disk. The interweaving of actual war footage into the episodes, however, adds to the realism of the storyline.

Now that I've finished the last two episodes of Season 5, I will start watching from Season 1 all over again.",1364169600,,2245,4.423728813559322

Now, retired, I have re-watched the series and am amazed at it compares to what passes for entertainment today.
The acting, the writing, the production, the story telling, all top notch.

Black and white or color in the last season, Combat! remains the standard for television war drama, equaled only by HBO's Band of Brothers and Pacific mini-series.

One caveat, the discs are incredibly tightly secured in the multi-leaf cases. Use great care to remove them the first time without damaging the discs or smudging them with unclean fingers.
And unlike the single 1/2 season packages, the full 5 season set has no informational sheets, so if you want background info, buy the COMBAT! Companion book by Jo Davidsmeyer. She is the uber-fan and series historian who is featured on the extras in the discs and knows more about the series than anyone alive. Another interesting companion book is the MGM, Hollywood's Greatest Backlot by Steve Bingen.

2413197,5,B000BC8SXI,"Those, who follow my reviews of products I have purchased know that I grew up when TV only had three channels, before PBS. That is why we have so many channels on cable that show classic TV before color. The younger generation takes for granted all the technological advantages they have today. Many stars of today appeared on this series. The two stars, Vic Morrow and Rick Jason are no longer with us. Unlike today a television series produced 39 original episodes, too many to rerun over the Summer. There was also more time to tell a story and they were not packed with so many commericals. The trainning for actors was a lot better. They were not stars one day and forgotten in a short amount of time.
I have put this series on my wish list. I am hoping that it will be re-released again with a better transfer. Right now I have been renting through Netflix. Due to age, many of the DVDS are damaged and they have to ship certain discs more than once. But if you a really a fan of this series, you will want to buy it now.

I also learned that he is the father of Jennifer Jason Leigh, another great actor. I never liked any type of war movies or tv shows until Combat.
Vic Morrow is the show and the supporting cast is also great. I love this quality DVD set, it is very well done and I love that there aren't any commercials!!!!",1339459200,3,662,4.304
2413207,5,B000BC8SXI,"I started watching this show when I was 6, in 1963 (missed the first year due to young age).  This was my favorite show until it went off in 68 (and Hawaii Five-O came on and took over as favorite show)!  I remember this show as being exciting, and that's about it.  Now that I have watched the complete series over on DVD, it overwhelms me.  The show is just tremendous!  The storylines are unbelievably good.  It shows war in all its grimness, and with all the hard decisions.  That was what got me the most, were all the hard decisions that everyone had to make.  The actors were all really good (I didn't remember Cage was being such a hottie).  I knew most of the guest stars now (most of them weren't as well known back then).  The episode with Mickey Rooney had me crying (I didn't know MR was capable of that kind of acting)!

I read that they did not let anyone play a German speaking part on the show, unless they spoke German.  This really contributed to the realism.  I think the worst thing about the show was being glued to the set, and then hearing the teeny squeak of the tanks way off in the distance.  I was shouting ''KRAUTS'' everytime I heard it.  SCAREY feeling!

It's all here.  The horribleness of soldiers plowing through your town, blasting it and your people to smithereens; the humanity and the inhumanity. This show has everything.  I can't believe that at 6 years old I could see enough in this show to make me prefer it over the comedies that would appeal to children.  But watching this now, I'm just stunned by the quality and meaning in the show.

BEWARE***  If you are like me, watching this series could turn you into a WW2 freak!  After watching this and then researching the war, I found there was a LOT that they didn't teach us in school in the 60s and 70s.  This show led to major WW2 research.  And unfortunately, my father was no longer around to answer all the questions I had.  I gained a whole new respect for all WW2 veterans, as well as all other veterans.

This show deserves 100 stars!

(One caveat!  I didn't think the first year was as good as the others.  It was before we had the major players in the platoon, and I didn't enjoy it nearly as much.  So if you start watching and don't like it, keep on plugging, cuz it gets great later!)",1337472000,9,2290,4.307511737089202

2413210,4,B000BC8SXI,"Purchased 2007 for $160.80

I was 8-13 years old when Combat originally aired and it was one of my favorite shows.  I can still remember how excited I was when the promos came out for the 1966 season saying it would be in color --- and how disappointed I was when my parents explained that you needed a special tv set to see it in color.  (which we didn't have)  So 40 years later I finally got to see the final season in color.

I was able to appreciate the ""human interest"" stories that I totally missed as a kid.  Back then I just loved the weapons, explosions, etc.  It was fun to see all the familiar guest stars.  To name some:  Albert Salmi, Keenan Wynn, Robert Culp, Lee Marvin, Nick Adams, Leonard Nimoy, Eddie Albert, Alida Valli, Marissa Pavan, Telly Salavas, Mickey Rooney, Sal Mineo, Rip Torn, Robert Duvall, James Whitmore, Frankie Avalon, Gilbert Roland, Charles Bronson, Jack Lord, Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, Wayne Rogers, Bill Bixby, James Franciscus, Margaret O'Brien (grown up!)and Ricardo Montalban.

Many people note the authenticity of the show.  In some ways I agree.  They appeared to have gone to a lot of trouble to use authentic weapons and uniforms when possible.  Bigger items like tanks and planes were not always correct but that is understandable.  Having the Germans speak German and the French speak French added to the sense of realism.

Obviously I wasn't there but some things seem incorrect to me.  As far as I know, a US army infantry squad consisted of 12 men.  In Combat there is usually about half that number.  Sometimes when the story called for them to suffer some casualties a couple more men would be added.  Also, were there really that many medics available?  The Combat squad almost always had one along.  About 99% of the Germans shot were immediately killed but for Americans over 50% were only wounded.  Many of the wounds were surprisingly benign.  Doc just sprinkles some powder in the wound and tapes on a bandage and the GI just shrugs it off and keeps going!  Somehow I don't think a rifle or mg bullet in the shoulder or leg is so easy to recover from.

The Germans weren't portrayed as being as stupid as in Hogan's Heroes but they were pretty bad.  In episode after episode they just stay in one place and let the Combat squad flank them.  Often they just stand up in the middle of a fire fight (and immediately get shot).  I'm not complaining that the Germans are made to look bad.  What bothers me is that it makes it look like the fighting (for the Americans) was easier than what it must have been historically.

The production values of the show were first rate.  Many of the scenes reminded me of something that would be seen in a movie.  Not many series from that era (or even today) could compare to Combat.  It is even more amazing when you remember they made 32 episodes per season (first 3 yrs.) and they were each over 45 min. long.  (fewer commercials than today's shows)

The special features were great.  I believe every dvd had something.  A few were just a collection of still photos but most of the time one of the 3 or 4 episodes on the dvd could be played with audio commentary be someone associated with that episode.  The audio from the show itself would be muted and you would hear an interview (by the special features producer) of someone associated with that episode: an actor, guest star, writer, director, etc.  It was very interesting to listen to them talk about their memories of the show.  Often I would watch the episode as it aired and them immediately watch it again with the commentary on.  Unfortunately many of the stars were already deceased when the dvd set was made.  You did get to hear Caje and Doc though.

People debate over what caused the show to be cancelled: the push against tv violence or the increasing salary demands of the stars.  I expect those both played a part but I also think the writers were running out of ideas.  After watching all 152 episodes I noticed how often they would use the same idea: the new guy with issues or the German disguised as an American.  For whatever reason the producers decided not to advance the stories beyond France.  If they had showed the push into Germany it would have opened up a whole new set of stories.

It would have been a better show if there was a sense of continuity from one episode to the next.  As is, you could take an episode from season one and another from season four and not know which came first.  Kirby is the only character who actually evolved over the course of the show.  Since all of the characters would have been ""green"" in the beginning, I wish the show would have portrayed that.  They (including Saunders and Hanley) could have been less confident, more fearful, etc. in the beginning and then evolved as the series progressed.  Of course, back then I don't know of any American produced series that allowed their character to change over time.

In summary, Combat was an above average series whose production values still hold up when compared to today's shows.  The dvd set is first rate in terms of quality and special features.  Would I buy it again?  No, not at the current price.  The stories are just too repetitive.  If I could do it over I'd just buy a couple of the smaller sets that contain a sampling of the better episodes.  (Best of Saunders, Best of New Replacements, etc.)  It is hard in today's economy to justify paying more the $30 a season for a 40 year old tv show, even one this good.  Hollywood loves to put out films that lecture us about the evil, greedy corporations.  They never seem to realize how the criticism could easily be applied to themselves.",1335744000,12,5665,4.536561264822135
2413211,5,B000BC8SXI,"I was young when this television series came out. I loved the show than and still do. For those who don't know, the first four seasons are in black-and-white, the last in color. The DVD displays in the classic format, it is not widescreen but it still plays well on a flat screen HD TV. The other major thing is that the order of episodes this box set is setup follow the order that they were syndicated in, not in how they actually appeared. This is important because if you do not know this, the sequence of when things happen does not always make sense, characters will appear and disappear out of sequence. To get the order that they actually appeared, go to IMDB and search for the Combat series and look at the episode listing. This will require you to jump around within the season's DVDs but I feel it is worth it. We have only started with Season 1 so I can't tell if this is also for the other seasons. It is also obvious at the end of each episode the trademark year will appear. Also like other reviews have said, initially the discs seem hard to get out from other CDs or DVDs. I have found that by pulling up on the side a little and pushing firmly in the middle button, they will pop out. Enjoy.

When I started watching the series I noticed, on more than one DVD, the movie would freeze or become jerky.  I have experienced this before on ""older"" DVD's that I own, but not brand new ones.  I had to stop and clean the DVD each time this would happen...sometimes two and three times with the same DVD.  I also experienced a very hard time getting the DVD's out of the clear plastic holders.  Two of the DVD's actually cracked while getting them to release from the packaging.

2413230,5,B000BC8SXI,"My dad, a WWII vet, never missed this show when first broadcast in the early 1960s. I was too young to appreciate it then, though I certainly can now. ""Combat!"" was not melodrama; it was real drama. As others have observed, despite its title the series' emphasis was never on battlefield action: it could not have been in those days of limited budgets, without computer graphics. The stress was on men, and occasionally women, under stress: what war did to them, sometimes for good though usually for ill. The stories dramatize moments of heroism, often of a contemplative, understated sort: the capacity of a human being to realize and to face what was within him under intense pressure. The actors, led by the splendid Vic Morrow and Rick Jason, are all top-notch: their offstage friendship seamless translates into teamwork before the camera. The production values are, for the period, excellent. (Most of the seasons, thankfully, were filmed in black and white, giving the episodes a quasi-documentary, newsreel feel.) Some of Robert Altman's earliest professional film work is on record here; Morrow's own directorial excursions were no vanity projects--he knew how to tell a story with a camera. Some of the scripts are sub-par; most, however, are well worth the hour's viewing; a few, like Gene Coon's ""Hills Are For Heroes,"" are outstanding. The set has been lavished with more commentaries and special features than one could reasonably expect of a series fifty years. A lot of love went into this show then and in its restoration now, and the camera doesn't lie.",1306022400,4,1572,5.0038167938931295
2413231,5,B000BC8SXI,"I remember COMBAT with fond memories, watching it while sitting on my father's lap. Back then, it made me interested in history- especially WWII and armaments.  For it's time, it was generally well written and acted.  Even today, many of the episodes still stand out.  I believe the weaker episodes were earlier one's with Shecky Greene.  They were trying to come up with an identity for the show at the time and couldn't decide if it was all drama or drama and comedy.  The attempts at comedic relief are weak and seem out of place.

One of the best things of the series is that the Germans spoke GERMAN, the French spoke FRENCH. Except for one episode, there were never subtitles; you feel as if you're a U.S. soldier right in the thick of it, you don't speak the language, you're just as scared as they must have been. I remember original promos for the show stating ""...see the war through a soldier's eyes..."" How true. Very well done. Because it was prime time TV in the 1960s we don't see a lot of blood; a soldier is shot and simply falls over. Today you'd see gore everywhere (I'd recommend the HBO series ""The Pacific"" for that kind of realism). Combat! is a show for any true fan of military conflict. And for me personally, I had a lovely note back from Pierre Jalbert (""Caje"") when I wrote him about the series, a note I'm VERY pleased to have received ;)",1298505600,,1006,4.272251308900524

I have watched about every WW2 series and movie that I can get my hands on and this Combat TV series is at times, even better than some movies. The series ""Rat Patrol"" doesn't even hold a candle to Combat. Rat Patrol always used the same actors even after they were eliminated in the show, the same vehicles, the same scenery.
Combat is always fresh with new faces, new scenery. Very unpredictable outcomes keep you on the edge of your seat. Its the best of the best.
Vic Morrow stars as platoon leader SGT. Saunders in this gritty 1960s TV series about American soldiers in Europe fighting the Germans. Most of the series is in black and white which gives it a more ""realistic sense"" of the times. Towards the end of the series some where done in color.

The characters become like a part of your family. You care about them. Like all of us they struggle and have their strengths and weaknesses. However, their generation was ""our greatest generation"", as Tom Brokaw's book called them.

2413242,5,B000BC8SXI,"I'm on about my third watch of this set it really is amazing how good this show was for being an hour long show the attention for details was above and beyond.  Of course when you marathon the show one after another you will notice a few things such as the French village that never seemed to stay in the allies hands, the difference in the bore of Saunders Thompson SMG from scene to scene as legend has it Morrow complained about having to hump the the nearly 13lb gun around all day up and own hills so they came up with a much lighter prop gun for scenes where there was no shooting involved. There's a couple more like Morrow wearing a Rolex Sub in later color episodes and my most favorite one is that of a freight train rolling along in the background with mid 60's Chevy passenger cars aboard but hey if you get caught up in the minor details you end up missing the main reason for its popularity and one must remember when they came out it was once a week not two or three episodes a night one after another.  It was also a series in which the stars were not Hollywood pretty characters these guys were gritty and at times unlikable and presented the look of battlefield stress weekly.  My late father being a veteran of combat in Europe just couldn't not sit and watch this show as a rule without getting up and doing something else when it was on in the 60's and the main reason why I think they hit the spots that had to hit to make it believable the memories were just too fresh just a scant 10 years after the war.  If pressed he would point out little discrepancies in the show but really didn't throw a wet blanket over it either..If your are a child of a WW II vet still wanting a better understanding of what our fathers went through, a military buff, although somewhat expensive this is a series you just have to get and will flat wear out on your DVD.  It comes with little antidotal info before each show of what to look for and is loaded with some of Hollywood's brightest and best of the period who guested Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Sal Mineo, Telly Savalas, Robert Duval, Robert Culp, it appeared to be one of the must do series of the period.

2413244,5,B000BC8SXI,"Well I finally got to the end of this set and I must say, I'm a little bummed that I did because I really enjoyed it. At 120 episodes, it takes a good long time to see them all, even if you watch 2 per day, lol.

I watched these as a kid and always liked Combat back then but seeing them now as a not-so-young adult brings a new appreciation. This is mostly because I realize now that this was a lot more than a war story...and a lot more than US and Nazi troops blasting away at each other. Rather there was some excellent writing in most of the episodes. The stories are chock full of tales of morality, overcoming fear, dealing with the loss of loved ones, and the extraordinary feats that average human beings pull off when their backs are  against the wall.

Rick Jason and Vic Morrow both did one heck of a job and of course Vic did some of the best directing in some top episodes. Rick really handled his part well and was a talent for sure, but it was the episodes featuring Vic which were the most believable and captivating. Vic had a way of acting in which he very seldom ever over-acted. In his case less equals more...sort of like some of Eastwood's stuff. Through dozens of episodes he's cool and collected. Then in a couple where his character sees kids who he befriended fall victim to the carnage he does lose it and nearly goes over the deep end. But he does a good job of making his portrayal real.

Vic Morrow, was the best and a complete stud at acting and directing in this series! He deserved better than the tragic death he got while filming a movie years later. But life, like the events depicted in Combat, is seldom fair.",1277596800,5,1648,4.255591054313099

After nearly 40+ years, the series still holds up. I think ""Combat!"" is under appreciated by the mainstream media given how ground breaking it was in the 1960s in portraying World War II. Unlike the more ""sanitized"" presentations of WWII in the 1940s and 50s (e.g., ""Sands of Iwo Jima""), it presented the grit and grim of war. The tensions or conflicts within the squad with believable characters was convincing--superb acting across the board. Vic Morrow (""Chip"" Saunders), for instance, had the gritty disheveled look and demeanor that was utterly believable in battle.  I also much appreciated spoken German that enhanced the authenticity of the series. I have no proof, but it wouldn't surprise me if Steven Spielberg had look at old clips of ""Combat!"" while researching ""Saving Private Ryan."" Of course, ""Combat!"" doesn't have the graphic realism (or gore) of the battle scenes of ""Private Ryan,"" but many of the elements in the film are strikingly similar to those in ""Combat!""--using a squad as a microcosm of all soldiers in post D-Day France, the tensions/conflicts of personalities within the squad, to name a few. It seems to me that the seeds of ""Saving Private Ryan"" were planted in ""Combat!"" I'm happy to have this series as a nostalgic treasure of my youth.",1272844800,3,1406,4.882845188284519

I bought the entire series and have watched them all.  The video seems excellent but I was extremely disappointed to find that there have been numerous ""cuts"" from the original.  The biggest set of cuts involve Caje and his knife throwing ability.  Each of the group had different weapons with which they excelled.  To cut all accounts of Caje's knife throwing capabilities was a horrible exclusion.  If there is there a way to get an uncut copy of the original series, I would be willing to do that.  As it is, it was nice to have most of the Combat series but I wonder what else was cut.

It was and is a wonderful Series. It brings back alot of memories and allows one a good insight on the History of WW2 in the European Theater.

  The real blood and guts are left out that younger audiences can watch and enjoy it and the war explained to them in contrast without all the gore of War .

Video games to day pertray killing in imagination but also in gore that is acceptable and liked instead of the horror it truly is . Here in the combat series you have the horrors of war and its victoms pertrayed as human beings and their stresses and struggles to adapt to that Horror , rather than imagined into being something good .

Combat had a great cast of characters Vic Marrow , Rick Jason , Pierre Jalbert,Jack Hogan ,Dick Peabody all who seemed to be perfect for their roles.

The series featured marvelous acting all around. The writing was quite good and, at times, prophetic. `Combat!' was as great a program in the 60s as was The Sopranos in the 90s. It was cinematic - not a cheap effort to produce ""product."" It was genuinely good. The Altman episodes were special, but others were just as excellent.

Video quality, although it's not in color, is excellent in the native 4:3 aspect ratio in which the series was shot and so far I have not had any problems with the DVD's.  I'm looking forward to completing the series.",1232409600,5,552,4.565656565656566

2413269,5,B000BC8SXI,"As an avid DVD collector of 1950s and 60s series, all I can add to these outstanding reviews is that I believe this to be the series from the past that holds up best. Great plots(always about people, personalities and how they hold up under the stress of warfare), great acting, great guest actors and superb production values(locations, settings, and A.D. Flowers special FXs!!!)all add up to a great series. Most highly recommended, especially as so many of the stars are no longer with us. A most fitting tribute to Rick Jason and, especially the great Vic Morrow!! TV never got any better. Hollywood- try to reproduce this series today! Way, way too expensive. So, let us give thanks for small miracles.",1231286400,3,707,4.80327868852459
2413270,5,B000BC8SXI,"This is a great collection to have!  If you have seen Combat  on TV then you know what a great show it was.  It is the fore-runner of Tour of Duty TV show  Combat has guns and fighting for the men, and storylines and drama for the women.  A few episodes are a bit over-dramatized with the human emotion factor, but considering this was done in the 1960's it is above average.  The black and white episodes are just as visual as the clor episodes.  Entertaining for everyone!",1231200000,4,474,4.318181818181818

2413272,3,B000BC8SXI,"The series is a classic and if your a baby boomer it brings back a lot of memories with Rick Jason as Lt. Hanley, Vick Morrow as Sgt. Saunders, Jack Hogan as Kirby, Dick Peabody as Little John and those who played Doc and Caj as well as the first two seasons with Billy.
The show itself was a great show for it's time and even holds up today and if you get a good set it's worth owning. My frustration is that the set that I ended up with has a large amount of digital distortins on many of the episodes which takes the enjoyment out of watching such a great classic. Their needs to be much better over sight and quality control when DVD's are made with video transfers to DVD on such shows as Combat. If you bought this set and have no problems that is great but I would like to know how many others also ended up with a set with digital distortion that ruins the episodes and enjoyment of watching an old favorite and classic such as Combat. This set should be five stars but with the digital distortions I can barely give it a three star.",1210896000,50,1041,4.1330049261083746
2413273,5,B000BC8SXI,"""Combat!"" was the most realistic, exciting and emotional show in television history. This gem about a squad of soldiers battling it out in WWII after D-Day did not glorify war, though there were lots and lots of actions scenes and firefights, but instead focused on the individual soldier and how he dealt with the war personally and as part of a brotherhood. Terrific writing, superb direction, believable characters and slam band action were the trademarks of this true TV classic. Big name directors and actors lined up to become part of the show which ran for 5 seasons and 152 episodes on ABC and has developed a huge following to this day. The series regulars were superb and believeable. Vic Morrow, Rick Jason, Jack Hogan, Piere Jalbert, Dick Peabody and Conlan Carter all shone on thier own unique ways. The characters of Saunders, Hanley, Kirby, Caje, Littlejohn and Doc have become etched in our minds forever. ""Caje, take the point"" was a phrase uttered quite often as myself and my childhood friends would act out the episode of Combat! we just watched and now as adults we see the show in all it's glory we may have overlooked as children. My only ""complaint"" about the show as in any show with recurring characters, we knew our heroes would not perish. We knew they would get the job done because there was another to do next week. As an adult, it lessens the tension a wee bit but who really cares? These are our heroes and we want them to succeed, not die and the characters and actors pull it off so well, it really becomes a mute point. I loved that the Germans actually spoke German. so what if we didn't know what they were saying? Whatever it was, it had to be bad and something that could hurt our beloved squad. My biggest disappointment through all this praise, and I feel it is important, is the lack of respect Combat! gets in the mainstream. Fine, it can stay our ""little secret"" but please, let's give credit where credit is due! this was the finest example of dramatic television in the mediums history! Let's recognize that! Let's not forget about it! When classic TV is discussed, let's not forget Combat! Please don't push it aside and bury it like the mainstream has! It is an important show and one that should be seen again and never forgotten. And how about giving Vic Morrow a star on the hollywood walk of fame!",1204675200,97,2350,4.584323040380047

The only problem is that on each disk he's watched so far, there is one episode that is defective. It freezes and restarts multiple times throughout the episode. Unfortunately, it is outside the time frame for returning.  Otherwise he likes it.",1517875200,,418,4.5
