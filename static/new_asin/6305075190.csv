8104529,1,6305075190,"This puff piece which centers mostly on Roy Rogers does little to enlighten the casual viewer and plenty to frustrate the serious student of this important but largely overlooked genre. Some glaring errors:
1. Ken Maynard was the first movie cowboy to sing on screen not Gene Autry.
2. The first ""gold record"" was issued in 1941 to the Glen Miller Orchestra for ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" not to Gene Autry for ""That Silver Haired Daddy of Mine"".
3. The narrator states that Rogers' father built a houseboat and floated ""down the Ohio"" from Cincinnati. They were then involved in the Portsmouth Flood. Portsmouth, Ohio is upriver from Cincinnati.
4. The film states that Rogers, then Len Sly, met his first wife, Arlene in Roswell, New Mexico. In less than a minute Roswell is said to be in Arizona. Arlene is never mentioned in the film again. 5. A supposed meeting between the Sons of the Pioneers and Will Rogers is said to have taken place in California the day before Will Rogers and Wiley Post were killed. Rogers and Post were killed in a plane crash in Point Barrow, Alaska.
There are many more errors and omissions too numerous to mention. Though Tex Ritter is mentioned (and erroneously credited with writing the musical score for ""High Noon"") how can you make a documentary titled ""The Singing Cowboys"" and omit Eddie Dean and Rex Allen?
