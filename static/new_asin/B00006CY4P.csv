1742287,5,B00006CY4P,"I watched this as a child in kindergarten over 20 years ago, I loved it then, and love it now! My 2 year old loves the songs in Nutshell kids. My 6 year old loves the stories. She is thrilled to have a book to go long with the story of the Wild Things.",1054771200,8,252,3.685185185185185
1742288,5,B00006CY4P,"This is by far one of the best childrens videos we have, right up there with Wallace and Gromit for holding kid interest while still being pleasant for grownups to hear/see over and over and...  Another plus is that the animated versions of the stories don't at all spoil or change enjoyment of the books for me or for my little boy.
I found the Wild Things short a little jarring at first, but that wore off, and it never bothered my son.  All the other shorts we have all loved from the first viewing, and are always happy to see again. I find myself humming the Nutshell kids songs when the video isn't on!
Another plus is that the stories and songs are witty, original and fantastical without being saccharine sweet.  The portrayal of the characters is very upbeat, there is nothing violent, mean spirited or sexist, and no rapid editing.
I'm sure any kid who would enjoy the books, would enjoy this video.  A great addition to the video library of any parent who needs kid vids that they can enjoy too.",1049673600,15,1007,4.456521739130435
1742289,5,B00006CY4P,"Please disregard the negative review given by a previous owner here. This is a thoroughly-enjoyable DVD for children & adults alike. I've had no technical problems with the disc, and it is a wonderful musical/animation experience for young children.
Maurice Sendak certainly has a unique writing style, and while I've seen people criticize his work for showing a bratty side of children, I can't say I agree. I like the fact that Sendak shows the children in his stories as little people with ranging emotions, not as little puppy dogs waiting for a treat or a pat on the head. The characters in his stories show anger, brattiness, sadness, and disobedience as well as happiness and playfulness, like all real children do. It's a refreshing change from the rampant political-correctness that pervades society today.
On to the contents. The first chapter of the disc is, of course, "" Where the Wild Things Are "", an all-time classic children's story, and the favorite of many children that grew up in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. I love Sendak's style of animation, which isn't full and overblown. Max is a tempermental little fellow that most children will be able to identify with. The Wild Things are both fascinating and repellant ( like many older relatives, which Sendak expounds further on in the extras feature ), and we all had a far-away place tucked into the back of our minds as children, where we could escape to when the parents came down on us. It's a wonderful tale, but the highlight is the muscial score & narration by Peter Schickele (who also is given the same duties for 'Night Kitchen'). The music sounds like it was made where the wild things are, and Schickele narrates with infectious enthusiasm, bringing life to the words, sounding as if he's telling his favorite story as well.
Chapter Two features 4 musical vignettes taken from the chidren's film 'Really Rosie'. The music was composed and performed by Carole King, and is fantasic. ""Alligators All Around"" is the best of the bunch, a joyous romp through the alphabet. 'Pierre', 'One Was Johnny', and 'Chicken Soup with Rice' are also fun little tunes the kiddies will enjoy.
The last chapter is 'In the Night Kitchen', an offbeat little story that strays from the norm. The tales centers around Mickey, who we eventually find out is responsible for delivering the milk which makes the morning cake.....it's a fun story, and you'll find your kids imitating the sounds of Mickey the Pilot's plane before you know it! Once again, Schickele brings a fitting score and enthusiastic narration.
If you have children, buy this disc. They'll love the animation, the music, and the wonderful narration. You won't be disappointed.",1048896000,54,2696,4.901531728665208
1742290,5,B00006CY4P,"This is a stylistically cool video, with unusual themes, sophisticated music, artful images and yet it is STILL a magnet for kids.
We loved the Nutshell Kids ""extras,"" especially Chicken Soup with Rice. When our two-year old gets cranky, I start singing this song and it always ends with a smile.
Watching it, I felt the stories themselves were too abstract for young children, but it seems that that is part of the charm - it holds their interest long after the familiar storylines of Bob the Builder become soporific.
This video really is art for children.",1046390400,8,558,4.762886597938144
1742291,5,B00006CY4P,We received this DVD as a gift for my 3 1/2 year old son. We have most of the books in the stories so my son loved to see the characters come to life. The music is wonderful and I don't mind hearing it loud in the background. It is thoughtful and intelligently done and I feel so much better about my son watching something like this than most of the junk that is made today. I intend to buy all of the other DVD's in this collection and we will have many good chioces when it is time to watch TV.,1045440000,4,497,3.8823529411764706
1742292,2,B00006CY4P,"This is a strange DVD, and hardly makes me inclined to buy any more of the Scholastic series. It feels a bit scraped from the bottom of an intellectual property barrel, due both to the technical ineptitude of the DVD itself and the uneven quality of the material it includes.
The DVD's navigation works very poorly, for one: at times, especially after running the ""Nutshell Library"" songs, the DVD moves on to playing material from the ""Extras"", starting with an interview with Sendak himself. If this happens, it is impossible to use ""top menu"" navigation to return to the main choices. The only way to get back to the main choices is to eject the DVD or skip tracks back all the way to the FBI warning. A viewer also cannot select individual ""Nutshell Library"" songs as separate chapters: you have to select the whole track and fast-forward through it if you only want to see ""Chicken Soup With Rice"", for example.
The Nutshell Library songs are taken from the ""Really Rosie"" TV special and sung by Carole King. As the full ""Rosie"" is not available on DVD, this is almost worth the price of admission. The songs are as captivating as they were when the special first aired. I can only assume that there is a problem with the rights to the show itself, as a DVD of the entire program would make vastly more sense as a commercial product than this patchwork quilt of leftovers.
The version of the ""Night Kitchen"" on the DVD is, well, ok. The voicing and musical accompaniment makes a certain amount of sense, or at least doesn't contradict the mood of the original Sendak. On the other hand, the voicing and scoring of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is flatly horrible: discordant, crude, over-the-top, charmless. Both pieces of work are quite old and minimally animated.
The extras are nothing special: a decent interview with Sendak, a version of ""Wild Things"" in Spanish.
The DVD is not a good value, but it is almost worth having to have the Nutshell songs.",1045440000,25,1958,4.645533141210374
1742293,5,B00006CY4P,"I enjoyed this video as much as my three and a half year old grandson, for whom I purchased it.  I hastily bought it for a babysitting weekend, and did not realize additional stories were included.  The music  was great--Carole King a great bonus!  We loved it!",1035158400,9,261,4.48936170212766

Even wee ones will delight in the story of the months - Chicken Soup with Rice, as well as learn the months of the year at an early age as my son did with this video.  Carole King's voice range is PERFECT for all of the Nutshell Library stories - she had my son singing along with her right from the start!  Max's story can be a tiny bit scary for the littlest viewer (2 & under), but talking about what the story means with your child makes all the difference.  Peter Schikele's presentation of In the Night Kitchen is impressive and brings the story to life.  Best video we have EVER purchased!",1032134400,15,610,4.260869565217392

1742327,5,B00006CY4P,I used this for a family movie night for younger children instead of the motion picture version which is much to long and scary.  We did crafts and played some games that was related to the story. They really enjoyed the evening.,1292198400,,229,4.4523809523809526
1742328,5,B00006CY4P,Where the wild Things Are was put out when my son was 4 yrs old so this was years ago.  He just loved it and i remember him watching it over and over.  I have a granddaughter 4 yrs old now so i decided to purchase this. Great price and faster shipped than expected. Well she loved it as much as my son.  She watched it 5 times the first day.  I definitely reccomend! Now don't be confused with the one thats currently out now in 2010.  This is the original.  This ones way more appropriate for younger children. The newer one is a little too scary. When my granddaughter gets a little older i will let her watch the newer version.,1278201600,,630,4.122950819672131
1742329,4,B00006CY4P,"I would recommend this to anyone who remembers seeing it as a child.
My only complaint is that the Nutshell Kids cartoon included seems to be a cut-down version of the film Really Rosie which I would have loved to have seen again in it's entirety.
I find it slightly amusing that some people are so offended by the sight of the little boy's winkie in the Night Kitchen film.
If you watch the Maurice Sendak interview included in the special features he explains that he wrote the story remembering that as a child he would sneak around his own house at night in the nuddy.  I mean, who's never done that?
Personally I'm not a huge fan of that film anyway but the world's got a bit too sensitive if you ask me.",1238544000,,709,4.291044776119403
1742330,4,B00006CY4P,"I loved this! It really brought me back to my childhood.

The Night Kitchen was a little embarassing to watch with kids, and I wasn't sure what their reaction to ""I don't care"" would be, but they were fine with it.

Although I could be wrong, I think these cartoons would have a tough time making it in today's world, but the fact remains these were a part of growing up, and I love having them back in my life.",1225929600,2,411,4.125
1742331,5,B00006CY4P,"I can't wait to own the entire Scholastic Collection, especially at these great prices.  My daughter absolutely loves the stories.",1225670400,,130,5.5
1742332,5,B00006CY4P,"This is an excellent video for young children. The narrations for `Where the Wild Things Are' and `The Night Kitchen' are outstanding and so is the music. I will never read `Chicken Soup with Rice' again without hearing the song in my head.

The short at the end with Maurice Sendak is an interesting snapshot of the author at the time it was made.

About the quality of the recording: Remember this video was intended to be used after the book has been read (and reread hopefully) to your children. There are no CGI effects, it's mostly animated drawings from the books and since it looks like the DVD was made from converting the old Betamax version to DVD the quality is not digital so don't attempt to adjust you set that's just the way it is. The original sound recordings were analog too and it doesn't sound like it was a digital remix so the sound is not of digital quality either. Other than that, the quality of the DVD is good.

A warning: The boy in the story The Night Kitchen is anatomically correct so don't be surprised when he loses his clothes and jumps into the milk. The story doesn't make an issue of it, it's just there. Today this might get an 'R' rating or at least a PG-13 for nudity.

In summation: This is a great follow-up experience video for any child (or adult for that matter) who has read and loves the Sendak stories.",1213142400,2,1351,4.392
1742333,1,B00006CY4P,"I recently purchased this DVD for my 3rd grade classroom. Thank goodness I previewed it before I showed it to my students. In the very last story, ""In the Night Kitchen"" the narrator speaks about a boy losing his clothes. Then, in the annimation portion, they show the boy naked floating through the air. Last but not least, the illustration is a vivid drawing of his private parts. I was shocked to say the least. More than likely, my job would be on the line if I had not previewed it beforehand. I wouldn't even let my 10 year old daughter watch it now.

Update:  Due to the negative comments I have received since I wrote this review, I gave the DVD to my principal and another director and asked them to review it in order to get  their 'take' on it. Not to my surprise, they both agreed that it was inappropriate for any classroom and thank goodness I did not show it. I would not want to do 'damage control' in regards to parental complaints. With this in mind, it goes to show the varied opinions that exist in the public classroom in 2010 and then we wonder why as a nation our scores are lower than other countries. Hmmmmmmmmmmm.",1212451200,5,1147,4.370892018779343

Of all the Scholastic story DVDs this is the one I put in first.

It is the second of three Sendak programs on this DVD, and it is adorable.  In this segment, Sendak's prose has been put to music by Carole King, and the result is something your child will sing along to and ask for again and again.

When my son was 3, he initially found the DVD version of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" a little scary, though he did not have that problem with the book.  At 4 now, he loves all the programs...though his favorite remains The Nutshell Kids (One was Johnny, Alligators All Around, Chicken Soup with Rice, and Pierre).

1742364,5,B00006CY4P,"This is a must-have DVD for kids and will be watched many times by your children. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is of course by far the best of the short films, but the rest are entertaining as well and give a glimpse to the B-Side of Sendaks exceptional talent. I loved the jazz music that accompanied the videos, and my fvorite was ""Chicken Soup With Rice,"" probably just because the music was so good. Be prepared for a few giggles if you're watching this with seven to eleven year olds, as there's a perfectly harmless animation of a cupid-like naked boy in one of the shorts. Only the prudest of Americans will find it politically incorrect, and European readers are probably wondering why American kids might giggle.

Have no fear, the artwork which you loved from these tales is completely recreated and animated lovingly.  Better yet, now there's something to please your ears!  Hearing these tales was always a subjective exercise, but now you can stamp your feet and snap your fingers along to the tunes sung by the incomparable Carol King.

""Where the Wild Things Are"" is a classic, almost iconic story and with simple animation that preserves the integrity of Sendak's art.  Watching the DVD reminds me of seeing films in school in the 1970's.  Now, as a Mom, I see the story through different eyes and relate to it even more!

""In the Night Kitchen"" is pretty bizarre but I find it charming as well.  I love the spoken word rhythm.

1742431,1,B00006CY4P,"I gave it 1 star only because I had to in order to rate it. This DVD is just terrible!  The Wild Things are ugly and scary and the music makes it worse.  In the 2nd story, one of the songs is about  manners and shows a spoiled, rotten kid. He straightens up by the end of the song but he's already driven home his ""I don't care"" message to children watching it.  In the last story about the little boy, first he gets naked and then these bakers stir him in some batter with his hand sticking out of the mix and they put him in the oven. If that's not enough, by the end the little boy shows his privates!  I looked at the ratings here before I bought it and can't believe this has 4 1/2 stars.  Don't be fooled just because it's from Scholastic.  I would give this zero stars if I could.",1107475200,10,787,3.9745222929936306
1742432,4,B00006CY4P,I did not preview the whole tape before showing in class.  The students were shocked and so was I when in the last segment the boy's clothes were off (for about 5-10 seconds).  It showed something that I am not sure some parents would appreciate.  Preview everything- even if it is from Scholastic and recommended for ages 3 to 8. Trust Me!!,1106870400,7,341,4.467741935483871
1742433,5,B00006CY4P,"Our 18-month old LOVES this DVD -- she knew all the Nutshell Kids songs because I grew up with them and sang them to her even before she was born.  She was thrilled to see the songs she knows so well come to life in animation, and begs to watch them again and again.  I like that the animations aren't slick and flashy, so they're gentle on her young eyes, and with closed-captions on, the video experience can be reasonably close to our reading experience (I don't want her to learn to prefer TV over our reading sessions!)

I thought she'd be scared by the monsters and the ominous music in Where the Wild Things Are, but, again, with the gentle animations (with pictures taken directly from the book), she wasn't frightened at all, and immediately started growling and stomping along with them!

Night Kitchen is a little trippy for my taste, but my daughter enjoys this one as well -- she now runs around the house shouting, ""I'm Mickey!""  Clearly, she is enjoying this DVD a great deal, and looks forward to watching it.  We've combined it with the books to reinforce what she's watching, and together they've really added to her vocabulary.  It also doesn't hurt that the DVD grabs her attention and gives us a welcome and guilt-free break!",1102464000,11,1246,4.585585585585585
1742434,5,B00006CY4P,"How can you not like this dvd?  I grew up watching this on VHS till it broke.  Now I'll have to buy the DVD.  This is simply the best work of both writer/illustrator Maurice Sendak and Carole King (besides her biggest album, Tapestry).  Great songs, great stories, great animation.  Highly recommended.

A note on the animation:  All of the video material of the Weston Woods collection has the same style or movement of animation.  Very often there is no animation at all, and the page from the picture book is shown.  Keep in mind that Maurice Sendak is a children's book illustrator, not an animator, and so his original artwork is preserved by keeping the animation limited.

However, this collection of Sendak's best children's stories is highly entertaining due to the Carole King songs for the Nutshell stories, the Peter Schikele score for ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" and the excellent dixieland jazz score for ""In the Night Kitchen"".  The quality of music is what separates this collection from all the other scholastic videos.  It is music that you won't mind hearing a million times.

Oh, and the people who bashed this DVD probably did not watch it as a kid in the late eighties on a well worn video tape.  If they did, their reviews would all be five stars.  All little kids are bound to dig this.  One of the reviewers is much too concerned with the technicalities of the DVD.  Geez, it's only 35 minutes, quit whining about too few scene selections.  Kids watch movies the whole way through anyway.  Don't we have to do that in the movie theatre?  Isn't that how TV worked before TiVo?  Nah, can't be.

I watched this video more than anything when I was very young, and I still go back to it today.  I was happy to see all the original VHS material on the DVD.  No more, no less.  That's how it should be.  This is by far the best of the Weston Woods/Scholastic DVD collection.  The other ones can get quite irritating with repeat viewings.  How do I know this?  My mother is an elementary school librarian.  Enough said.",1098921600,16,2037,4.562326869806094

Where the Wild Things Are was little intense at first but my 3 1/2 y-o now thinks its great (and recites all of the lines).  Carol Kings compositions are wonderful, and I am thinking about transferring them to a cd for the kids (ok, ok, for me!)

I love one was Johnny, chicken soup with rice, alligators all around, and Pierre. If it wasn't for the Dresden's dolls cover of Pierre, I would have never seen them. And I liked where the wild things are. I remembered liking in the night kitchen too, and I'm not going to take the easy route and say, oh, there's nudity afoot. This may be the weirdest thing I ever watched. Kids being dropped in cake, Hitler looking bakers, cake batter airplanes. I like weird, but this is really out there. I thought after I saw I never promised you a rose garden THAT was the weirdest thing I ever saw, but in the night kitchen (no pun intended) takes the cake.

7967235,5,B00006CY4P,"i was absolutely distraught at the reviews of this DVD that featured the amazing work of Maurice Sendak.  The fact that they are disturbed by the dream sequence in ""Mickey in the night kitchen"" and the ""frontal nudity"" irks me.  This is a kid!  It's a dream!  Cripes. Seeing dirtiness here is in the minds of the viewers.  This is absolutely amazing music by the inimitable
Carole King and combining it with the nutshell library is genius.  The songs will be in the adults' heads for days, not to mention the kids.  A 70s gem for those of us who want to share our childhood with our kids.  My only mild complaint is about the narrator of Mickey--I just don't think he got the book, the cadence is off.  But my kid loves it, so what do i know?",1416182400,,742,4.280575539568345

7967238,5,B00006CY4P,"I love these. I used to read and sing the books to my son.  He loved the video when he was a child.

The reviews that state that the videos are inappropriate for children, Maurice Sendak stated - ""I said anything I wanted because I don't believe in children I don't believe in childhood. I don't believe that there's a demarcation. 'Oh you mustn't tell them that. You mustn't tell them that.' You tell them anything you want. Just tell them if it's true. If it's true you tell them.""
 Maurice Sendak

Before you buy or watch the video, read the books and look at the Mr. Sendak's marvelous illustrations.  Carol King's songs are wonderful!

I was going to donate our old video to charity, but my son saw it (he is now in College) and asked me to keep it.

There once was a boy named Pierre....
One was Johnny...
