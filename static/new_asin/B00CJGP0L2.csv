8582535,3,B00CJGP0L2,"The 25th Anniversary Of WrestleMania:
WrestleMania celebrated it's 25th EDITION (not anniversary if you want to get technical) here with a few notes in that Tazz left WWE earlier in the week when his contract expired & with there being no ECW match, the entire event was a 3 man announce team of Michael Cole & Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler, the lead singer from the pop group ""The Pussycat Dolls"" (don't remember her name & honestly, don't care) sang the national anthem, and newly inducted Hall Of Famer Stone Cold Steve Austin giving his own salute to Texas.
The match that had the entire world talking about this PPV was ""Mr. WrestleMania vs. The Streak"" with Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels in a match that had everything (including the unique ""Heaven & Hell"" entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the closest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his ""Deadman"" character returned 5 years ago while Shawn was even so desperate at one point that he was hoping for a win via count out. The main event was the WWE Championship Match with Randy Orton challenging Triple H in a match where the title could change hands on a disqualification however it was a stipulation that only hurt the match more than helped as it wasn't played out well on so many levels with the story of Triple H keep ""holding himself back"" while they hit their finishing moves in the first minute that popped the crowd only to slow the match down so much that the crowd was dead minus big spots. Another standout match here was Chris Jericho in a handicap elimination match against Roddy Piper & Jimmy Snuka & Ricky Steamboat with Ric Flair in their corner that saw Steamboat put on such a performance for a man who's been retired for 15 years that was better than some of the current talent today but stay tuned for the aftermath involving Jericho & ""The Wrestler"" star Mickey Rourke. Other matches include World Champion Edge vs. John Cena vs. Big Show, the Money In The Bank Ladder match that saw Kofi Kingston be the human highlight reel of the match, the Ms. WrestleMania battle royal that saw some divas from the past return along with the a ""debut"", the Hardy brothers of Matt & Jeff fought against each other in an Extreme Rules match, and Intercontinental Champion J.B.L. vs. Rey Mysterio that would end up changing one man's career forever.
Blu-Ray extras include the Hall Of Fame featuring Koko B. Ware (why?), The Funks, The Von Erichs, Bill Watts, The Fink, Ricky Steamboat, and Steve Austin.  Other Blu-Ray extras include the pre-show match to unify both the WWE & World Tag Team Titles between Carlito & Primo vs. John Morrison & The Miz along with highlight packages from all the previous WrestleMania's.

The John Cena Experience:
Like him or hate him, John Cena is the face of World Wrestling Entertainment but as they say, ""with great power comes great responsibility"" as he's had one of the heaviest (if not THE heaviest) schedules for a guy in his position than many of those before him so this is a behind the scenes look at what is life as the top guy in WWE & unlike his previous ""My Life"" set, Cena actually speaks for himself on here.  Throughout the documentary you'll see & hear Cena comment on various things such as Tribute To The Troops, his TV appearances from shows like Psych to commercials for Gillette, involvement in sports like ESPN & Grand Marshall for the Fiesta Bowl, filming movies like Legendary, his music, the WrestleMania weekend from the show itself to all the weekend festivities like the golf tournament & Make-A-Wish pizza party, and action figures.  Various extras include a photo gallery, Cena's entrance video, a Q&A session, his WrestleMania entrance rehearsal, and talking about the CeNation.

Matches include the finals of the Best Of 5 Series for the United States Championship vs. Booker T (No Mercy '04); Kurt Angle (No Way Out '05); Shawn Michaels & Kurt Angle in a triple threat match (Taboo Tuesday '05); two matches against Edge (Royal Rumble & Tribute To The Troops '06); with Shawn Michaels vs. Rated RKO (""RAW"" Feb. '07); Falls Count Anywhere vs. Great Khali (One Night Stand '07); Bobby Lashley (Great American Bash '07); Randy Orton (SummerSlam '07); his return during the Royal Rumble match (Royal Rumble '08); Triple H (Night Of Champions '08); Shawn Michaels (""RAW"" Jan. '09); Jack Swagger (""RAW"" Apr. '09); Big Show (Judgment Day '09); Miz (""RAW"" June '09); Shawn Michaels & Triple H in a triple threat match (Survivor Series '09) along with Chris Jericho (Tribute To The Troops '09) & Batista (WrestleMania XXVI) as Blu-Ray extras.

WrestleMania was hyped to be a major show due to the 25th anniversary but was a letdown quality wise with the only highlights being the first HBK vs. Taker Mania match, Steamboat's performance, the Hardys, and Money In The Bank.  The John Cena Experience is a good look at all the hard work Cena does behind the scenes to promote the company but the matches itself ranged from good to great (depending on who he was in the ring with) with some clear duds (he's never had a good match against Big Show since 2004).  So I would have to say this isn't a double pack to go out of your way to see but if you got a few spare bucks & haven't seen either of these sets then I would recommend.",1368230400,,5390,4.648478488982161
