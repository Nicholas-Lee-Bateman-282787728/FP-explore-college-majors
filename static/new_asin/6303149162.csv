588849,2,6303149162,"A young man and his sister are kept locked away in their rooms by their father, who is a wealthy nobleman.  The father says his children have demons of the mind and brings in a doctor to help cure them. At the same  time someone is killing young women in the town and the townspeople are  trying to figure out who. A strange priest also wanders around babbling  about some evil that is present and says he is preparing to stop it.  Eventually all of the above come to a head at the same time and place.  The first half hour is slick and sometimes eerie due to good photography  and strong settings.  The film then begins to unravel into a very  predictable film that revolves around sexual obsessions more than anything  else. The film still looks good, but eventually it cannot help hold up the  mess that this film becomes.  Robert Hardy (the father) is wasted in this  dribble that really started out as something, but falls apart in a hurry.",951696000,4,945,4.424418604651163
588949,3,6303149162,"""Demons of the Mind"" is an obscure Hammer film from 1972. The plot revolves around a Baron in 1835 who keeps his adult son & daughter locked-up and drugged because he thinks they're insane, like his dead wife. He hires a dubious doctor and another man to assist him. Meanwhile there are murders in the local area and a priest meanders around babbling about the evils of the Baron, etc., which incites the villagers.

On the positive side, ""Demons of the Mind"" has many of the positives of Hammer horror films -- lush Gothic atmosphere, serious characters & story, stunningly gorgeous women and a quality score. On the downside, the plot isn't interesting and there are no characters to sympathize with, except for maybe the Baron's daughter (the beautiful Gillian Hills) and the guy who comes to the castle to aid her. Unfortunately, Elizabeth is too zoned-out to care about and the guy is a secondary character.

Another plus is the fanatical priest who rings true, but the character isn't given enough screen time or dimension.

FINAL WORD: Although ""Demons of the Mind"" is a decent Gothic horror flick from Hammer, it's not as good as most of their vampire, Frankenstein or werewolf flicks. It's hard to relate to the topic of generational ""insanity"" (I put that in quotes because it's never clear if the son & daughter are truly insane or if the father causes their condition through his misguided treatments) and there aren't any major characters in which to sympathize.

The film runs 89 minutes and was shot in England.

588950,4,6303149162,"Taking into account the length of time I have been a Hammer fan, I had never seen this film until very recently. As other reviewers have pointed out, it was made during the latter period of Hammers productivity. As such, it is a bit more violent and has more nudity then the studios previous output. This may be offputting to some, but I highly doubt that will matter much to modern audiences as it still quite tame (by modern standards).

So is the thing any good? I personally really liked it! I am a big,big fan of the late Patrick Magee so any opportunity to watch him chew up the scenery is worth a look in my opinion. Sure the plot and some of the proceedings are a bit convuluted, but I found that interesting and kept me engaged through until the very end. In other words, I was ""entertained"".

Perhaps not a ""classic"", but i'm glad I watched it and will likely enjoy it again sometime. It is worth a repeat viewing, in my opinion. How many recent movies can you say that about?? I rest my case",1326931200,,1002,4.296296296296297
588951,2,6303149162,"This should have been a cracking little film. A superb cast, including Michael Hordern, Robert Hardy and Patrick Magee with a potentially interesting story set over 90 minutes looks like a winner from the start. Its not...

Sadly the script lets the whole thing down badly. There are quite a few really clunky lines which made me wince, and the plot whilst initially slightly confusing became entirely predictable as the film went on.

This being made in the early 70's Hammer took the opportunity to take advantage of the more lenient censorship laws and so this does contain nudity and some quite violent scenes. These don't particularly enhance the film, and you'd expect them from a late period Hammer film anyway.

In all honesty as the film got near the end I couldn't wait for it to finish, it had become that irratating. Oh by the way, yes that is the Paul Jones of Manfred Mann and Blues Band fame who plays one of the leading roles.

The only Hammer film I have seen worse than this was Prehistoric Women. My advice don't watch either....",1230595200,2,1048,4.648648648648648
588952,4,6303149162,"From the title alone, one can deduce that ""Demons of the Mind"" is psychological horror.  It was once thought that all psychological illness was caused by demonic possession.  In ""Demons of the Mind,"" Baron Zorn (Robert Hardy) believes that his own psychotic behavior is a genetic disease that his adult children have inherited.  Therefore, he locks them in separate rooms and keeps them weak and helpless with drugs and blood letting.  Meanwhile, young women are being attacked and murdered in the nearby village.  Who in the Zorn household is responsible?

  An excellent performance is given by Gillian Hills who is Elizabeth Zorn.  We watch her transform from helpless victim to vengeful, wrathful psychotic before our very eyes.  Amicus regular Patrick Magee (""Tales of the Crypt, ""Asylum,"" and ""And Now the Screaming Starts"") is excellent as the unethical Dr. Fischinger who blames the children's madness on their father's physical and emotional abuse.  Michael Horden (""Theatre of Blood"") is excellent as the fanatical priest who, with ax and flaming cross, leads an angry village mob in putting an end to the madness of the Zorn family.

  ""Demons of the Mind"" is one of the strangest gothic films I've ever seen.  Not as frightening as I had hoped it would be, but very creepy and disturbing.  One can't help but frown upon how mentally ill patients must have been treated in the eighteen hundreds.  Furthermore, most of the film's violence takes place during daylight hours.  In some ways, this is good because we can see it all; however, it's not as frightening.  A higher body count among the villagers would've helped the plot move faster.  Most of the killings occur in the film's final ten minutes; the finale is quite gruesome and unique, and very sad.  The fanatical priest steals the show.

  Anchor Bay did an excellent job of restoring ""Demons of the Mind.""  The picture and audio are excellent as though it was filmed yesterday.

  I enjoyed ""Demons of the Mind"" tremendously.  However, being partial to gothic horror, I realize that everyone might not appreciate it as much as I.  Therefore, I recommend that you rent it first.",1212883200,3,2148,4.952247191011236
588953,1,6303149162,"I love bad movies, this is the most unbearable movie ever made. don't ever buy it for a penny",1196035200,,93,3.9473684210526314
588954,3,6303149162,"The movie was okay but not great, especially if one has seen any of the other Hammer movies.  The script is a little jagged in the beginning so the plot is hard to follow but otherwise the acting is great as is the music and the scenery.

""Demons of the Mind"" features a good cast but I would have liked a little more energy from them.  Not to imply that the acting was bad, in fact it was quite good.  It just seemed to lack a little stage presence that slowed the movie down even more.  I'm not familiar with any of the actors (except for the doctor) so perhaps it is my own ignorance that led me to think this.

Basically it's an okay movie with some scary bits.  I like Hammer Horror films (esp. the 1970's ones) and this one was fun.  As someone else mentioned the terror in this movie is not a physical being but a mental state and contributes to the unusualness of the movie.",1170979200,,882,4.147058823529412
588955,2,6303149162,"By the time this movie ends, if you've followed the incoherent plot, you probably won't even care about the characters.  No character is developed beyond a sheet of stale cardboard, so we have rather empty people saying rather empty things.  Hammer films always fell victim to some dialogue cliche (basically, all the follies of Gothic fiction) in order to keep the movie moving along, but this dialogue?  Wow.  And this plot?  One long winding string of ""I don't care"" after another.  There's something of a plot here: one guy is crazy; he's afraid his kids are crazy; he wants a doctor to cure them; the doctor says he can; the doctor then says that the children's ""illness"" is a result of the first guy exercising his ""will"" over the children; then the first guy tries to kill his kids.  Oh yeah, and somewhere in there, the first gets weepy and frustrated over he and his wife's conjugal bed.  Uh-huh.  Or something like that.  One reviewer said this movie has great scenery, and I agree; but the characters populating that scenery are the real problem -- especially in a movie that wants so desperately to be character-driven.  A character-driven movie without characters is bound to fall flat on its face.  And ""Demons of the Mind"" does exactly that.  Sorry Hammer.  Sorry Peter Sykes.  Thanks for ""To the Devil...A Daughter.""  That was a creepy, unnerving movie, and it was driven forcefully by good characters and interesting actors.  Too bad you didn't keep this one on the shelf.",1113350400,,1489,4.776470588235294
588956,3,6303149162,"Hammer Studios 1972 release of Demons of the Mind wasn't quite what I expected...it does have a number of the markings of a Hammer film, gothic settings, lush scenery, horse drawn coaches, angry villagers, a little blood, and let's not forget the naked women, but it takes a different turn in the type of story presented.  There are hints of a physical monster, but the real terror appears to us in a more metaphysical sense.
The movie is very slow going for about the first half, as the movie seems clutch to certain plot elements like a miser to his coins, not sharing much.  Patience is needed, but may not be worth the wait for someone expecting a more traditional Hammer horror film in the manner of Dracula or Frankenstein.  I recognize and appreciate the effort made to try and expand on the traditional Hammer format, but I just didn't feel this movie clicked entirely with me.  I didn't so much mind the slow pacing, but the horror was more obtuse and unfocused, in my opinion.
The story involves a Baron and his semi-adult children and a horrible event that happened when the children were much younger.  They seem to suffer some sort of malady, which the Baron is convinced is 'in the blood', so he keeps them drugged up real good and uses archaic techniques of blood letting to try and find the cause, which renders his children pale and weak.  There is murder, incest, and a slight mystery involving a subplot about nearby village women being murdered, but the mystery isn't much of a mystery.
Not a bad movie, and I really did enjoy the gothic feel throughout.  I also really enjoyed Patrick Magee's (A Clockwork Orange) performance as Falkenburg, a doctor with dubious credentials enlisted by the Baron to assist in helping the Baron cure his children from their 'Demons of the Mind'.  Another notable actor in this movie is Paul Jones, lead singer of the 60's rock group Manfred Mann.
Anchor Bay releases an excellent wide screen print of the film, along with the standard trailer and also includes a separate commentary track with the director, the writer, and one of the actresses, of which I have not had the opportunity to listen to yet...and look for the excellent and thorough 'liner' notes in the small foldout inside the DVD case.",1073260800,6,2254,4.688607594936709
588957,4,6303149162,"Although often overlooked, this ranks with Peter Sasdy's ""Hands of the Ripper"" as one of the finest and most unconventional films produced by Hammer in the 1970s.  It looks gorgeous - thanks partially to expert cinematography by the great Arthur Grant, and partially to the use of real locations instead of the usual studio sets.  Peter Sykes' direction is outstanding; the film's lush visual poetry carries an erotic charge that is a far cry indeed from the embarassed girlie-magazine imagery of so many of Hammer's ""sexy"" films of the period (""Lust for a Vampire,"" for instance).  The performances (by an exceptionally fine cast) are generally excellent, although Robert Hardy overacts badly.  The film also contains some of Harry Robinson's best music, most notably in an early sequence that runs for several minutes without any dialogue at all.
One of the film's most attractive features is the way in which it consistently turns the conventions of Hammer horror on their heads.  Wild coach rides, sinister mansions, torch-bearing villagers, a series of monstrous murders of busty barmaids - all the usual Hammer paraphernalia are here, but many of them are put to unconventional or at least subtly different uses.  The story itself is equally unusual, with shades of Mesmer and a complete absence of supernatural forces.  For all its novelty, however, you may find it a bit dull. But with so many incidental pleasures, who cares?  This is a fine and enjoyable film - one of the last really solid efforts produced by Hammer before its gradual disintegration.
The DVD commentary track is definitely worth a listen.  It features Sykes, screenwriter Christopher Wicking (as always, an intelligent and refreshing interrogator of the horror genre), and actress Virginia Wetherell, who has only a small role in the film but delivers some of the most interesting commentary.  All in all, another fine addition to Anchor Bay's very welcome Hammer Collection.",1040860800,6,1954,5.155063291139241
588958,4,6303149162,"Demons of the mind is a later hammer, a 70s production from their third period ie it is bloody and features nudity and a depressing ending... [....] The director of demons of the mind, one Peter sykes brought his own imprint to this film and To the devil a daughter (while fun is a murky all-star mess), it is much, much darker than any other hammers,[....]the opening scene of the film is one of the most brilliant dream or recollection sequences in cinema (not an exaggeration). But be warned, not every scene is composed like that one, all drifting and skilful camerawork and amazing cutting. [...]this film is beautiful, eerie and dreamlike but only in parts. It is also ludicrous (psychotic and psychopathic personality order by proxy anyone?), meaningless, plotless, pretensious (actors deliver cod shakespeare addresses to themselves in theatrical earnest) and depressing (a vice or a virtue depending on your taste). But it is a fascinating film for all those reasons, actors like robin hardy and michael hordern keep a straight face delivering their lines with deadly seriousness and has Patrick Magee, a wonderful underrated british actor who always chills regardless of how timid or ineffectual his charcter is (clockwork orange as terence alexander, the masque of the red death and asylum), when he intones is his tremolous mahogany voice 'demons of the mind' it does not fall flat, it resonates and hearing it reminds me of the sensation that accompanies the turning of the pages of a book.
Good and evil are never clearly defined in this film, the villagers dance en-tranced to their rituals, grins on their faces en masse while teasing a woman with a flame, when they come to deliver their justice to Hardy's character at the end they are crazed and inhuman, unlike in other hammers, again twins of evil is a good comparison where the mob is righteous and purifying and even repulsive characters appear good in their quest to destroy evil, they are sadistic and brutal. The ending is extremely uncomfortable, again purification is hammer's usual close, not this time, but i best leave that for the viewer to discover.
The film as a whole contains buckets of tasteful bloodshed, much like all hammers of this period (if you've never seen someones throat torn out with a set of keys this might be for you, thankfully is not graphic) but there is no sadistic or violent sex, rather caring and unexploitative, delicate.
This is a fascinating film, in turns hypnotic and strange, daft and baffling, is clearly a hammer, but it belongs to this neglected breed (captain kronos, frankenstein and the monster from hell, fear in the night, blood from the mummy's tomb) of minor classics from their twilight years, serious yet silly, beautiful amd well made yet bloody and depressing.[....]i love this film, but if you don't like the sound of the negatives i have listed here, best go get yourself plague of the zombies or another hammer from their golden age before buying this whistful, delicate yet violent melange

They are imprisoned in their home, they escape from their rooms, they are caught, they are imprisoned in their rooms, they escape from their rooms, they are caught, they are imprisoned in their rooms, yada yada yada.  There's the cliche' intense doctor with a scheme for a ""blood cure"", there's the tinge of insanity, breeding with a town virgin with her ""pure blood"" to end a curse, a brother and sister who kiss once or twice, the sister meets a studious guy in the woods, they have sex, she is caught and taken to her room, he reappears later to rescue her...why?  The villagers have some fun freaking out the village priest with some pagan strawman burning ritual.  This could go on for an hour and 26 minutes...oh wait, it does.
Worst Hammer Film I've ever seen.  In their earlier days, before buying rights to monster stories, they made some really really intensely great films, collected into ""The Icons of Suspense Collection"" - ""Stop Me Before I Kill"", ""Maniac"", ""The Snorkel"", ""These Are The Damned"" (really excellent), and ""Never Take Candy From A Stranger"" - a film about a pedophile back in the days when the victims weren't supposed to report such things - really heartbreaking, full of tension, all well-acted films.

7840172,4,6303149162,"...was to have been the original title of this offbeat Hammer offering which attempts to combine their trademark Gothic settings with the type of PSYCHO inspired thrillers like HYSTERIA or MANIAC that they churned out during the early 1960s. For the most part it's a very successful marriage thanks to lush visuals, committed performances, and an interesting if somewhat convoluted storyline. Robert Hardy plays Baron Zorn, the tyrannical head of a family who keeps his young adult offspring (Shane Briant, Gillian Hills) imprisoned in the family castle because he fears they are tainted with ""hereditary madness"". Mesmerist Patrick Magee claims he can cure them only to discover that Hardy is the cause of all the trouble which includes feelings of incest between brother and sister and a number of dead female villagers. Throw in Michael Hordern's wandering mad priest and you have the makings of a grand, grim, and grisly climax.

I thoroughly enjoyed DEMONS OF THE MIND (the title reminded me of the ""Monsters from the Id"" line from FORBIDDEN PLANET) but I can easily see how others wouldn't. It's far too verbose for a horror film with not enough violent action until the very end when all hell breaks loose leaving us with an ending similar to that of WITCHFINDER GENERAL. Yet it's a delight to hear old pros Hardy, Magee, and Hordern strut their vocal stuff by making the rather dense dialogue sound a lot more meaningful than it actually is. The photography is lovely, the musical score is subdued, and the physical settings are extremely convincing making DEMONS OF THE MIND a quality effort, just not a popular one. If you're of a literary or theatrical bent then you can enjoy DEMONS as a kind of Jacobean tragedy. I applaud Hammer for making this film but like many of its characters, it was doomed from the start.",1379289600,,1826,4.871382636655949
