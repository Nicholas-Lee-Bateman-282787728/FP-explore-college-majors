3874321,5,B0028SVY2A,"keep in mind I'm from Long Island AND I'm a mother...you'll understand after you watch this.  I have always loved Jim Breuer, but this was one of the funniest skits I have ever watched!!  My 16 yr old son and I laughed so hard, tears were streaming my face and I think I cracked a rib!!  Jim is hysterical whether talking about music, alcohol, kids or doing 'goat boy'.  Very funny!",1265932800,,382,4.338028169014085
3874322,5,B0028SVY2A,"Never seen his stand up before ,but very funny. You may think this might be dad humor, its not its really funny, i am gonna buy it",1252627200,,130,3.8518518518518516
3874323,5,B0028SVY2A,"I usually don't buy comedy specials on DVD, but I watched this on Comedy Central a couple and just had to have a copy! It's good to see that he's actively fighting the assumption by the general public that he's a pothead just because he ""looks"" like one, and making it hilarious. Definitely worth entertaining friends with.",1250985600,,323,4.684210526315789
3874324,3,B0028SVY2A,"It seems Jim spent too much time talking about himself rather than things in life he finds funny.  I enjoyed the show, but it's not 5-star worthy.  I didn't buy this to get the behind-the-scene on goat-boy, or hear about his history with SNL, or how he got the part for the movie Half Baked; I wanted funny material about things in life we can all relate to.  This was nothing more than a story about his life, and as much as I like Jim, I really didn't buy it for that.",1250035200,,470,4.086956521739131
3874325,5,B0028SVY2A,"I saw the bit where Jim's daughters get him out of bed at the crack of dawn to play kitty about a year ago, and since then have been waiting for this vid to be available.  I swear it's one of the funnier riffs about being a dad I have ever seen, and it's so true.  I had to pause the show several times so I could stop laughing enough to hear the rest. My whole family loved it.  And who'd have thought that Breuer could do such a wicked kangaroo impression?",1249171200,,458,3.9565217391304346
3874326,5,B0028SVY2A,"As the title states, Jim Breuer is one of the funniest comedians out there.  #1 on my list.  This special was amazing!!  Being there live was awesome, but watching it back on DVD was even better than I remembered!!  (Which is normally difficult for me to say...)  The jokes are top-notch!!

The DVD is jam-packed with extras.  The fireside chat with his father is hilarious as always, the photo shoot was pretty cool, and the DVD menus are UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY!!!!!

I sit and watch the menus several times since they're all great in they're own way.  I can't believe how many laughs we all had watching the menus!!

DEFINITE buy!!!!  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!

3874327,5,B0028SVY2A,"This new show is really great, its Jim but in a whole new, matured package.  He really does clear the air and moves beyond the stereotypical style he sometimes is overly known for (pot head).

Jim's new content is excellent touching base with what any middle aged dad, son or husband can relate too.  He clearly has grown in life and his new special showcases that in a style that only Jim Breuer could supply.

Its classic Jim but all grown up and as always hilarious innovative and truly laugh out loud funny.

Buy it today!",1248739200,4,526,4.4375
3874328,5,B0028SVY2A,"I watched this on comedy central and thought it was one of the funniest stand up comedy routines I've ever seen.  There are not that many shows that make me laugh out loud, but with this one, I was laughing to the point where tears came to my eyes.  His material about being a parent and being woken up early by kids, having to watch them every minute, etc. was hilarious.  He is really talented with his voice imitations and the physical element to his comedy.  I was not necessarily a Jim Breuer fan before, but I am now.  I came online to order the dvd so I could watch it again and also share it with family and friends.",1248566400,,624,4.166666666666667

3874350,4,B0028SVY2A,Kind of disappointed as this was not as good as And Laughter For All. But still worth the money. Love this Guy,1393545600,,110,4.045454545454546
3874351,5,B0028SVY2A,"Jim Breuer's ""Let's Clear the Air"" DVD is hilarious!  The DVD menu has him doing bit pieces rather than the usual repetitive music and images.  The main act is 100% family friendly except for one gesture that kids probably won't understand.  The feature with his father is not family friendly as his dad curses some.  Jim's ""And Laughter for All"" (available for streaming on Netflix) is also 100% clean.  We've watched his shows over and over and still belly laugh through them.  He does an excellent job with physical comedy, acting and delivery.  I read his book and several years ago Bill Cosby challenged Jim to clean up his act.  The result is ""Let's Clear the Air"" and ""And Laughter for All"" are family friendly and super funny!",1390867200,,734,4.6796875
3874352,2,B0028SVY2A,I watched some of this on youtube and thought it would be hilarious. Turns out he talks about his family most of the show...kind of boring..i had to turn it off.,1388793600,,161,4.225806451612903

3874354,5,B0028SVY2A,"Let's face it.  Sometimes a little vulgar language helps the stand-up routine.  But, I am so sick of listening to very little comedy linked together by one swear word after another.  This guy is funny........ And, he does it without profane language.  He is great.",1368316800,,264,4.8
3874365,5,B0028SVY2A,hilarious from start to finish . I was laughing so hard on the part about the ferrets i was almost crying.,1355616000,,106,4.095238095238095
3874366,5,B0028SVY2A,I Love the fact that there are no bad words in the video and that you can watch it no matter who is in the room.,1353974400,,112,3.3461538461538463
3874367,5,B0028SVY2A,We saw Jim on Comedy Central and got the DVD soon after. We watch him in bed and laugh till we wake up. Great buy.,1352505600,,114,3.6
3874368,5,B0028SVY2A,"Jim Breuer 'Let's Clear the Air' funniest thing I've ever seen, his impersonations of Sylvester Stallone, Tracy Morgan, James Hetfield, Brian Johnson are all priceless you will be kicking your self if you do not get this.",1336608000,,221,5.0
3874369,4,B0028SVY2A,"Jim Breuer, that ""goat guy"", the stoned looking one in ""Half Baked"" and the ""AC/DC Hokey Pokey"" dude finally releases a full show on DVD. Jim explains that he hasn't been seen around much for the past ten years since leaving SNL due to bringing up his kids, and now in a Denis Leary style, explains that his family is his life now, and that's where he has been.

Jim delivers some great humor about his kids, his wife, his parents and his friends such as Dave Chapelle, Norm MacDonald and Tracy Something... Jim also revisits some classic jokes, such as 80's metal music for kids, and talks about how Goat Boy came to be, as well as informing everyone that he is not always stoned, he just looks it.

It's a funny show, great for those who relate to family issues, and surprisingly, he doesn't swear much during this show! More often then not, i'm one of those ""oh, comedy central have watered his material down and restricted him with the NO SWEARING policy"" but Jim manages to stay as funny as ever without cussing! Pick this up with Half Baked and enjoy a night of Breuer.",1294272000,2,1075,4.424242424242424

3874373,5,B0028SVY2A,"Great comedy set...I always enjoyed him on SNL but was relucatant to see this stand-up performance.  Glad I watched it, it's hysterical.  He touches on topics that a wide range of people will find funny: drinking too much, marriage, raising children, family and aging. I first saw it at someone's house and the next day ordered it from amazon!
Very funny!",1273708800,,355,4.80327868852459
