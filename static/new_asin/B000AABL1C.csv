8077042,3,B000AABL1C,Wasn't what I was expecting.  I had done a lot of reading on Butch Cassidy and found the story lacking.  It didn't cover a lot of what I would consider important events.  And it was rather short for the price.,1383523200,,209,4.175
8077043,5,B000AABL1C,"If you are interested in the real history of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, you should enjoy this story. We all hopefully remember that, while a movie might be good, it is still a movie, and is not necessarily totally factual. The movie stayed reasonably close to the truth, however, even to the name of ""Mr E. H. Harriman."" I thoroughly enjoyed learning a little more about ""the rest of the story.""",1377648000,,404,4.5479452054794525
8077044,2,B000AABL1C,"The historical content is mildly informative and raises some interesting conundrums viz did he die in Bolivia or return to the US. Whilst I enjoyed what the program contained, I really became irritated with the visual presentation. There is an excessive amount of stylistic, so called artistic, slo-mo out of focus scene transitions. Is this the new way to bulk up running time? It really is annoying. Content is repetitive - what this 50 min show presents could be  said in 20 minutes. Not one of the History Channels better docos.",1276300800,,532,4.846153846153846
8077045,5,B000AABL1C,Really liked the dvd.  Contained certain information that I didn't know before. I find it amazing that 2 notorious outlaws from the west could still be so enchanting this many years later.,1232323200,3,188,4.875
8077046,4,B000AABL1C,I found this an interesting and informative overview of the real Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.,1194048000,4,100,4.9411764705882355
