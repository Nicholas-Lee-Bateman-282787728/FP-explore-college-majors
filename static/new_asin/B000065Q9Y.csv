7961536,4,B000065Q9Y,"I really bought this to get the ""Scarlet Pimpernel"" with Leslie Howard.  The single version left some scenes out, but this one is complete.  In addition to my primary selection there are tow silent movies with John Barrymore Sr.  ""The Black Pirate"" is a good watch, but not one that I would purchase by itself, the same for the other one, ""The Man in the Iron Mask"".  I am a great collector of Movies, especially the 30's, 40's and 50's.  And also Old Time Radio, ""OTR"".  This buy was great for me, hope this will help people who might be interested.",1487462400,,550,4.396039603960396
7961537,5,B000065Q9Y,I chose this based upon another's recommendation for cleaner copy of TSP.  Film quality is definately in better condition of my previous versions of VHS and DVD.,1401408000,,161,4.962962962962963
7961538,1,B000065Q9Y,I was hoping for a beautiful reproduction from the old films. I recommend UTube via AppleTV for a relatively pristine print on The Scarlet Pimpernel...unfortunately... no English Captions...,1394409600,2,190,5.821428571428571
7961539,5,B000065Q9Y,Looked for this for a long time. Very hard to find at a reasonable rate. Price requests are all over the board. Keep looking and you will find it at a reasonable rate. Pretty good quality for old films.,1233446400,5,202,4.205128205128205
7961540,5,B000065Q9Y,"Bargain silent movies can be a risk. I often prefer more ""mastered"" (and expensive) DVD versions if the print is in bad shape. But all three of these were very good to look at.
I am a fan of Douglas Fairbanks movies, and the Black Pirate is one of my favorites. My favorite scene is Fairbanks capturing a merchant ship with passengers aboard single handed, and without firing a shot. NOTE: If you are looking for a good quality print of the Black Pirate, there is now a release from Kino Video (available here on Amazon), that is absolutely amazing. The film was originally filmed using a very new two-color Technicolor process, and this new release lets you see the the full beauty of the red and blue Technicolor dating from the age of silent movies! It also has about two minutes of footage not in the version on this disk.
The Iron Mask is also good but Fairbanks' character is older and he doesn't reach his usual level of athleticism. I also find that the story has the feeling of a sequel and is less engaging because of that.
I have always been a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I was not overly impressed by the lead in this film but it was still a very fun adventure/romance. If you have never read or seen any version of the Scarlet Pimpernel I recommend that you do so. This would be a very good place to start. (My favorite version is the recent A&E/BBC production starring Richard Grant, who manages to pull of the difficult task of playing a brilliant, swashbuckling, foppish idiot with more believability than those contradictions ought to allow.)",1037059200,23,1561,4.539007092198582
