8649124,5,B00J9RYZTC,"The opening combat scene was outstanding. Swords were flashing, and spears were being tossed. Fighting was up close and personal as Germans and Romans hacked each other.
.
In the arena scenes, the individual combats were bloody and brutal.
.
The details in the Blu-ray version were outstanding. These were evident in various scenes.
.
CLOSEUPS ON THE SENATORS' FACES: The viewer could see the individual hairs on the actors' beards and head with their varied shades and tones. Brown spots, hair stubs, lines, and pores on their aged faces were noticeable.
.
COSTUMES: The Roman armor was intricate with different tones and sparkles in the sun. The scratches and dirt showed wear.
.
CLOSEUPS ON THE COMBATANTS: The sweat on the gadiators' faces glistened and rolled down their pores, leaving wet trails on their faces. The sweat also bunched strands of hair together, while the dust settled and caked them.",1470528000,4,905,5.0
