8124205,5,B000FKP0NM,Very interesting documentary. Provides an event in history I would like to check out and learn more about. This DVD gives basic information on a piece of history. It does not state their was definitely a plot to overthrow FDR by upper class Americans--- but does present a case that needs to be more fully explored. Recommend this documentary.,1427500800,2,343,4.830508474576271
8124206,5,B000FKP0NM,A story that needs to be told.,1419984000,2,30,3.4285714285714284
8124207,5,B000FKP0NM,"A little known, and even less talked/taught about piece of our nations history; In one respect, the inevitable loss of Americans to own gold (1933), AND the implementation of obvious socialist programs in lieu of a free market paved the way for ""needed"" changes in the American way of life. During this time frame a private banking cartel (the Federal Reserve) took over our Congress's ability/responsibility to coin our money, AND, the implementation of the IRS (internal revenue system) changed the basic rights, responsibilities, and obligations of every United States citizen for the worse. This is a very interesting but in my opinion, slanted view of that time in our history, with no mention of the true cost to Americans then, and now.",1413417600,,743,5.048780487804878
8124208,5,B000FKP0NM,"A 1934 plot to overthrow the US government perpetrated by some of the most powerful people in Wall Street and media. Though the documentary seems afraid to connect some obvious dots at feature`s end, the subject is an amazingly revealing lesson in true power, and quite resonant to the modern day.

This should be a required subject of study in every school.",1362182400,2,358,4.774193548387097
8124209,5,B000FKP0NM,"This documentary interviews Jules Archer, the author of the great history book, THE PLOT TO SEIZE THE WHITE HOUSE, and supplements that account, with other historians, and with 1930s film footage and photos of principal characters, and of the secret congressional investigation that confirmed the plot. Shown are Smedley Darlington Butler, Douglas MacArthur, Irenee DuPont, and other principals.

The documentary is chronological and thereby provides a better sense of the reasons why things happened than does any other account, even including Archer's book. For example, this documentary makes clear why retaining the gold standard was central to the plotters' objectives.",1343952000,3,674,5.74
8124210,5,B000FKP0NM,"This documentary was very well done.  It relates an important and often forgotten part of our history which has been swept under the rug for decades.  A must see for anyone serious about American history.  I was impressed when I first saw it on the history channel, and I'm sad that they won't air pieces like this anymore.  Thank goodness their thirst for profits is still unabated.  It provides a decent summary of the relevant literature and evidence.  The books are available cheaper, but the this format makes the content easier to digest for most people.  Pricey for a one hour video, but worth it in my opinion.",1270425600,9,618,4.666666666666667

8124212,5,B000FKP0NM,Almost no one realizes there was a planned corporate coup to take over the government during the New Deal years. This little-known episode during the Depression is vividly recounted in this fine documentary.,1155859200,25,207,5.303030303030303
