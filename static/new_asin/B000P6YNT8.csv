2814454,5,B000P6YNT8,"Every time I get engrossed in a show, some nitwit network hack decides they want to cancel it in favor of another mind-numbing reality show. Seriously, a funny, intelligent, engadging, and touching show FINALLY comes along....and they axe it.  This is why more and more people are turning away from the televisions and increasing their DVD collections, if you ask me. Seriously, though, about the show. What About Brian is a great blend of comedy and drama that deals with situations we have ALL found ourselves in at one time or another...and no one gets voted off the island or has to prove their smarter than a fifth grader or the mob. I highly suggest you check it out.",1190678400,2,673,4.65546218487395
2814455,5,B000P6YNT8,"HELLLOOOOOO! This was a great show!!!ABC had it in the wrong time slot and should have re aired it from the begining during off season (at a better time slot, similar to how they do shows like wife swap) to show more viewers what they were missing! This was a more real ""today"" type show. They could of took the whole show alot further, boy did I have some good ideas for where they could have gone. This could have been the next Better Melrose Place. What are they thinking???? Anyhow for those of U who missed the first two seasons - the DVD's are something to check out...Only problem is you'll want more....ALOT more and if they have truly cancelled it we all are missing out!",1189209600,12,680,4.362204724409449
2814456,4,B000P6YNT8,"This series initially started two different ways: J.J. Abrams (creator of ""Lost"" and ""Alias"") trying to go back to his roots of simple relationship drama (year ago he created the WB hit ""Felicity""); as well as Jeff Judah and Jason Katism (of ""Life as We Know It"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" fame) trying to produce a show with their signature quirks, yet one with a premise appealing enough were they wouldn't get cancelled after 13 episodes.  And so ""What about Brian"" was born.

 The show was simple enough: Brian (Barry Watson from ""7th Heaven"") is a serial-dater that has never been able to keep a girlfriend around longer than several weeks.  Upon the engagement of his best-friend he finds himself as a 7th-wheel among his closest friends (including his college roommate/business partner and his much-older sister).  The series follows as Brian tries to search out love, as well as the various romantic entanglements/problems that his various friends find themselves in such as: affairs, new business ventures, single-parenthood, engagement, etc..  Essentially the show was about a group of early thirty-something's trying to not only make their mark on the world, but trying to share their success with ""that someone special"" and all the hilarity and heartache that comes with the territory.

 Unfortunately for the creators and ABC, while the premise was interesting, the actors/characters likable, their was always something missing from the series.  That special SPARK that a series needs in order to find itself on the lineup for the better part of a decade was missing.  After airing 6 our of the produced 8 for its first season the network pulled the show, re-staffed a majority of the producers/writers, fired an actors/hired three additional actors... basically all in an effort to make the show what it could be.  And while yes, the second season is an immensely pleasing 19-episode arc ultimately the series was doomed from the beginning.  And like similar shows of the past (such as ""once and again"" which had many of the same producers) the show was never able to find a following and it was canceled due to low-ratings.

 That is not to say the show is bad in any way.  In fact it's highly enjoyable, its just easy to tell why people would prefer to watch it in one or two sittings, vs. weekly over the course of a year.  Presented here on 5 DVDs are all 25 aired episodes (the 2 unaired episodes leftover from season 1 are not included) along with deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes interviews.",1186963200,25,2512,4.90307328605201
2814457,5,B000P6YNT8,This is one of the best shows ABC has ever aired.  I wish another network would pick it up and show them their mistake!!  You really do find yourself entertwined with these characters in a way I haven't seen since the old show Thirtysomething.,1182988800,2,243,4.5
2814458,5,B000P6YNT8,"That this show was cancelled after 2 seasons is a serious crime. Ever episode was fabulous and had the ability to be comical and endearing but also dramatic and frustrating. I often found myself screaming at the TV because you get so wrapped up in every characters storyline and you really will fight for each character. I believe there is no such thing as a bad JJ Abrams show and Brian clearly illustrates that. Every single main character is likable and different. I loved everything involving Dave and Deena. Those two are magical and great actors. The whole Marjorie, Adam and Brian triangle is edge of your seat great as well. Every show has some blunders and the Heather/Summer stripper storyline could have been left out, but this is a show that you will root for all the characters. It is thoughtful and I am positive that if you give this show a chance its impossible not to love it. I will miss it so much.",1182038400,3,917,4.530120481927711
2814459,5,B000P6YNT8,I am SO HAPPY that this DVD is being released!  I absolutely LOVED this show and was so sad when it was cancelled.  ABC never gave the show a chance ... they gave it a terrible time slot and never advertised it.  I will really enjoy having this DVD.,1180483200,7,249,4.040816326530612

2814462,5,B000P6YNT8,"Great series, comical at times, showing how family, friends, reacting to a series of ups and downs in peoples lives.  Great series for good entertainment.",1359676800,,154,5.16
2814463,5,B000P6YNT8,"It was so great to see this show again!  I forgot how much I missed it.  I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed the series ""Felicity"".  Both were gems in my opinion!",1353974400,,178,4.176470588235294
2814464,5,B000P6YNT8,I loved this show and was bummed when it got cancelled. When I found out I could buy the DVD I did.,1312502400,,99,3.5454545454545454
2814465,5,B000P6YNT8,"Love, love, love it!  Highly recommend purchasing What About Brian- The Complete Series.  The only bad part about this purchase was that the series ended after Season 2!",1293408000,,169,5.0
2814466,4,B000P6YNT8,"First season was great (though short)- it was funny and about common day life. The second season became a bit depressing. It is worth a watch if you like TV dramas. The second season has its high moments and also its lows. I don't know if I have heard of such horrible things happening to one group of friends. If you want a fun show that is addicting, this is for you.",1291248000,,369,4.138888888888889
2814467,4,B000P6YNT8,"This is a pretty good series about lives of a group of friends. The storyline features very human aspects of life such as love, friendship, and trust, among many other things. It is believable for the most part but it leaves fans hanging as the series is canceled, almost abruptly it feels like. The last episode gives enough closure but not enough for a fan of the series. It feels slightly rushed, but a good watch overall.

The acting can be a little mediocre on some characters but there are other worse series out there made.",1284768000,,530,4.520833333333333
2814468,5,B000P6YNT8,"What a show! Always finish an episode wanting more, such a shame they didn't continue the series but glad to have it on my shelf.",1272844800,,129,4.2
2814469,5,B000P6YNT8,I loved this show. Sad to see it go. At least I have the box set to watch whenever I want to relive it.,1231718400,,103,3.3333333333333335
2814470,5,B000P6YNT8,"WOW! I had no idea what I was missing, because when this originally aired ABC had it in a terrible time slot so I never had the chance to catch it. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of Drama, you have to pick this up.  It is in JJA's fashion where the drama can be intense and over the top yet feel completely REAL and believable.  Sort of like the 2nd Season of Grey's Anatomy was.  I hate what Grey's has turned out to be now, and I am sad I didn't know about ""Brian"" sooner.  Great Show, Great Cast and highly Entertaining.",1229040000,,523,4.048543689320389
2814471,5,B000P6YNT8,"This product was in excellent condition and came in a very timely fashion.  I would buy again from this vendor.  The TV Series was excellent, can't imagine why it was cancelled.",1225670400,,177,4.67741935483871
2814472,5,B000P6YNT8,"Good show! I was very sad to learn that they won't be making any more of the series.  It seems these days they get a good show on television and then for some reason it gets cancled. I'd like to know who decides what stays and what goes, doesn't my opinion as a veiwer count for anything? Anyway, I do enjoy the show and can only hope they revive it sometime in the near future.",1222732800,,378,4.04
2814473,5,B000P6YNT8,"When a show like this that depicts life using a twenty-thirty something character experiencing the ups and downs of what ""the journey of life"" has to offer, it's a shame that a television network, that can rely on these kind of series to boost their ratings, cannot see the whole picture.  ""What About"" bringing ""Brian"" back?!",1219017600,,326,4.821428571428571
2814474,5,B000P6YNT8,"What About Brian had such likable characters. I am sad to see that it's not coming back to t.v.! I kept looking for it!

Barry Watson is great as Brian. The rest of the cast was wonderful too, including Alexis Arquette.",1216339200,,219,4.341463414634147

2814476,5,B000P6YNT8,What About Brian was my favourite show and ended way too soon.  So glad that they put out the DVD and I completely recommend it to everyone... especially those of us in our early 30's looking for love and tired of watching everyone else in love.,1195171200,2,245,4.326086956521739
2814477,5,B000P6YNT8,"This show deserved a lot better than what it got. The writing was both heartfelt and funny. Serious when it needed to be but lighthearted when appropriate. The show was about a group of friends which meant different stories but the center of it was their bond to each other.

I was a big fan of those show and very sad when it was officially cancelled. I recorded the episode every week and always looked forward to the next.

This set has pretty cool extras with behind-the-scenes and an unaired episode. If you were a fan of ""What About Brian?"" you won't be disappointed. And if you are looking for a show to make you laugh, cry, and think...this is definitely one of those.",1194134400,5,676,4.443548387096774
2814478,5,B000P6YNT8,"I so didn't need my friend to point this out to me in the store today! I loved this show, and was mad when it was cancelled, and left unresolved at that. ABC just never gave it a fair chance to find an audience before they killed it. (Do you ever get the feelings networks sabotage shows on purpose?)

I was hooked from the first episode. The plot was old - Brian's in love with his best friend's girl, but I thought the way they wrote it was so cute and original. During the 2nd season, the show definitely took on more of a soap opera quality, but it was compelling and the characters were so likeable. Maybe it was compelling because the characters were so likeable. The writing was excellent - it was dramatic and funny, even if a couple of the storylines were plain silly. I used to be mad at the end of every episode because I didn't want to wait a week to find out what happens!

There's very few shows, and even then only select seasons, that I care to have on DVD, but I think this might be one of them.",1191628800,2,1012,4.131979695431472
2814479,5,B000P6YNT8,"I was a fan of the show, perhaps because I can relate to a guy who sees his friends pair off into relationships and he's left wondering why he can't seem to find that special someone.  I was disheartened to see it canceled so soon and thought that the story-lines could have been further developed as the series progressed into new seasons.  It will be interesting to see how well the DVD sells, perhaps if there is enough interest they may revive the show.",1191283200,2,457,4.428571428571429

8189741,3,B000P6YNT8,"Meh.  Story revolves around self-absorbed 20/30 somethings.  Main character is not that likeable and I did not find any of the characters compelling or particularly interesting.  If they were your neighbors, you'd probably want to grow some bamboo on that side of the house to block the view.  There were a couple of redeeming scenes.",1438214400,,334,5.0181818181818185
8189742,4,B000P6YNT8,"I wish more people had caught onto this show when it aired. It is a charming relic from the early 2000's. A well-written, low-key relationship drama centered on Brian (Barry Watson) the last single in his group of married or engaged friends.  It is far from being a soap opera as it focuses more on the emotional reasons behind Brian being single as well as the emotions faced by his friends in their various relationships.  The acting is all very good and I wish they made more shows like this.",1434067200,,495,4.488888888888889
