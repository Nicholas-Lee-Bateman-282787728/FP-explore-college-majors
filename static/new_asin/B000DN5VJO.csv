8237372,4,B000DN5VJO,Chiseen basically means crazy in Cantonese...and these guys surely are.  A hilarious mix of skits similar to Punked or Jackass headed up by Daniel Wu and other big Hong Kong actors who were originally from the US.  Chiseen had me totally cracking up...my friends and I really enjoyed it.  Apparently this show was originally aired on MTV in Asia...which was how I originally heard about it.  Good laughs...great as a party backdrop.  PS.  Do NOT miss Wokboarding or Book of Pain with the Durian...OUCH!!!,1142899200,4,504,4.940476190476191
