6440310,1,B00KQ82FP4,"I rent this movie based on the 4.5 stars rating from 6 people here at Amazon.com. Here is my opinion:
If you like B movie, this is for you. I think the story telling is horrible because I had a hard time understanding it. The plot is just as bad and the ending is very flat. The acting, well it lives up to its B-movie standard, and sometimes I don't even understand what they are saying because the accent are so thick, worst no subtitle of any language. But if you like only the action, you will be very disappointed. The few sword fighting scenes looks like some college kids put together. The special affect is as good as ""Made for TV"" movies.",1414627200,2,647,4.2682926829268295

6440314,5,B00KQ82FP4,An epic tale of good vs. evil with some plot twist along the way. A subplot reveals a love story that is worthy of a man to fight for and a girl to pursue. It's simplistic fun with a cool story where you cheer on the heroes of the tale. The team that puts these films together do a great job every time and this does not disappoint. The landscapes are epic and the cinematography is beautiful! I look forward to the next one!,1409616000,10,425,4.071428571428571
6440315,4,B00KQ82FP4,"3 1/2 STARS for an engaging and at times humorous adventure! 4 STARS for enjoyment

If you don't mind a little cheese and B movie production values with your fantasy adventure (and it often comes that way), then you will likely find this is a small marquee gem. Yes, with a small budget the effects and character development can be thin in areas.  There are little plot hole quirks. However, the adventure is engaging. The leads are very interesting, and the acting is actually quite good in the context of B movie production. The story and acting carry the day in the end. Amy De Bhrun in particular carries the show as the quirky-cool, so-so with magic, young noble woman. (She has also had spots on Vikings and Penny Dreadful)  One can always read the books to fill in the story.

THE PLOT: The scene is set as the narrator explains that a people called the Vitalion have invaded the land of Deira and oppress it's people, called the Deirans. With the Vitalion has come a dragon that poisons the land and preys upon the people. We are then quickly introduced to Ellen Barethon, a young noble woman who is the niece of the last keeper of Lorand Magic. This priestess also holds a relic that has the power to awaken the Paladin, the only one that can defeat the dragon. The priestess has been bringing up Ellen to take her place as the protector of magic. Unfortunately, Ellen just hasn't taken to the lessons and it seems her aunt has given up. In fact, she is quite the spoiled brat at first. As a last hope for their country, Ellen and her aunt set off on a journey to take the horn to a place called Gail where a right will be performed by the sisters in Lorand magic and the Paladin will be awakened. Unfortunately they are intercepted and the priestess is killed. Ellen escapes with a smuggler and the adventure begins as they undertake the journey make it to Gail in time. To complicate matters, there is a master of the dark arts called Corvus who will use his power to stop them and obtain the relic. The dark figure he conjures to do his bidding is actually quite cool!

It's a terrific adventure with some humorous moments and nice little romantic spots thrown in. If you are up for B movie fantasy, I am pretty sure you are going to like this one.",1407888000,17,2260,4.410071942446043
6440316,5,B00KQ82FP4,"An epic indie fantasy, this film takes place in the world of Paladin: Dawn of the Dragonslayer. It's a thrilling adventure from start to finish. The action sequences are incredible, especially the climactic confrontation with the monster on the sea cliffs. The real heart of the story, though, is the relationship between Elenn and Aedin. The dance from antagonism to friendship to romance is superbly depicted by Amy De Bhrn and David Haydn. Also excellent is Tim Treloar, who brings a sinister gravity to the villanous Magister Corvus.

It's a great movie, which hopefully will find the acclaim and the audience it deserves. Give it a try!",1407715200,7,641,4.990654205607477

6440334,3,B00KQ82FP4,"I am a sucker for movies about dragons.  There is a dragon in this movie...............however, it's primarily seen at a distance and infrequently.  And as far as I could discern, there was nary a crown to be seen or had.  True, there were swords in use but very little sorcery so it doesn't really qualify as a sword and sorcery fantasy either.  Nor is it a bodice ripping harlequin romance.  They do walk an awful lot over hill and dale so I suppose, in a pinch, it could be recognized as a hiking tutorial.  Otherwise, the story is vague and purposeless.  An uppity woman (Amy De Bhrun as Ellen Barethon) and her aunt are escaping from or going to something or other, carrying part of a thingy that turns out to be half of a unicorn's horn.  They have to be somewhere in time for the Paladin to appear.  Unfortunately, the aunt is killed and Ellen is on the run/walk of her life with no prince charming (David Haydn as Aedin).  Occasionally, a villain or two or three pops up to inconvenience them and slow their trek to who knows where or why.  Basically, it's all a lame excuse to throw these two lovebirds together and let them smooch now and then.  Ellen has auntie visions and the poor sod suffers untold grievances and bodily harm trying to protect her.  It's a Lifetime romance during the dark ages.  It could have used a lot more action, a lot more dragon, and a better ending.  But for all that, it was quite pleasant.....not very exceptional, just a slight diversion, could have used seven or ten more rewrites and someone to watch the continuity issues.",1438646400,9,1567,4.487632508833922

6440336,5,B00KQ82FP4,"Love this movie. the movie was very fluid, it seemed like it was a hour long. the smuggler and the paladin had the right chemistry. Scenery was great seemed like middle ages England instead of New Zealand, like the lord of the rings was.",1435536000,,237,4.409090909090909
8660727,4,B00KQ82FP4,Not a bad movie at all and I enjoyed it.,1533340800,,40,3.1
8660728,3,B00KQ82FP4,"This isn't all that bad.  Fairly obvious and predictable as it goes along, and there are a lot of goofs from scene to scene where outfits change that shouldn't and swords left behind are suddenly back again without having why or how as part of the story.  But some of the wizard magic is interesting and I wanted to see what the cutting editor would leave in the film when the woman gets tattooed.  Turns out not much.
The dragon has limited screen time, but at least when it does, the dragon is well represented.  I think it was filmed somewhere in Germany - the film, not the dragon.  The dragon more than likely is CGI.  But the scenery & sets are great, the costumes are good, and the acting is adequate - above B movie stuff.  Those who say otherwise haven't seen very many B movies.
On the other hand, censorship what it is in America, I imagine there was more to this film when it was released in Germany.  As it is on this DVD, there is no need for any rating higher than PG.  Could generate some nightmares in impressionable children.
Not sorry I bought it, but not one of my collection of DVD's that I intend to watch multiple times.",1508025600,2,1143,4.303738317757009
