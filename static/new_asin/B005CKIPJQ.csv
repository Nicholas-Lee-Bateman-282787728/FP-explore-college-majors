a comprehensive account of the life of Paul in several sessions. The film is very old but the material is straight from the bible; very faithful to the biblical record.",1506470400,,304,4.350877192982456

8465589,1,B005CKIPJQ,"DeForest Kelley is not in this tape and this is not the right series. The Amazon page for the DVD claimed it was an American film series:

Life of St. Paul (1949)
Cathedral Films
Directed by John Coyle

But the DVD is in fact a British film series:

Life of St. Paul (1938)
Pinewood Studios
Directed by Norman Walker

I had to return this video, since it was a gift for someone who collects DeForest Kelley videos, which this is not.",1361491200,10,433,4.308641975308642
