7949744,5,B00005Q64W,After 10 years of having the VHS Australian version with Narrator Robyn Williams (great narrator voice) this British release has more content.  The Australian version was cut up so much to fit commercials that a lot of information was lost.  An excellent documentary in not just naval history but history as a whole.  Excellent part of any history buff's collection.,1311206400,,366,5.066666666666666
7949745,5,B00005Q64W,"The documentary ""The Complete History of The Battleship"" is one of the best and informative video documentaries i have seen. A lot of very good information on the history of the battleships, how they changed and evolved over time, updates, etc. Very good documentary. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in battleships.",1193443200,,326,5.169811320754717
7949746,5,B00005Q64W,"The 'The Complete History Of The Battleship - A Thirst For Blood & Iron - Clash Of The Dreadnoughts, 1800 -1916' and the follow-on 'The Complete History of the Battleship: 1916 - Present' are two of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Both are very well done. This volume covers from the earliest sailing vessels through to Jutland. Great footage and even better historical narration.",1165190400,2,389,4.909090909090909
