His creative activities include films, drawings, animations, installations, theatre and opera. This is not a collection of his animations, but an intriguing conversation with the artist. In this film, shot in Johannesburg and Brazil, the artist talks of the impact of the South Africa landscape and social conditions on his work, and comments on his work process, career history, childhood memories, inspiration, and the life of his animation characters .",1205280000,8,690,5.457943925233645
