Jeff Warner is, by far, not the greatest on-screen teacher I've seen. His ""talk throughs"" seem a bit improvised on the spot. Also, the entire thing is rather short.
That said, I went through the first few examples, and it was clear that I had just learned something new. If you're an intermediate or advanced player, you'll be easily able to expand on the examples with your knowledge of harmony and scales. For a raw beginner, the benefits are bound to be rather small.
Overall, not a bad purchase, especially if you grab a used copy.",1284422400,,674,4.4
