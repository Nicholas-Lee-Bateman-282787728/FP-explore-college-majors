Outstandingly acted by Barbara Stanwyck, Paul Douglas. Robert Ryan (always so mesmerizing when playing bitterness) and even Marilyn Monroe, a limited actress who here rises to her best performance.  The film would be worth it for its first five minutes alone--a visual evocation and introduction without dialogue ending when Staynwyck walks away from the train in a memorable image, but it is never less than absorbing and will reward many viewings.

788205,5,6304119089,"In ""Clash By Night"", Marilyn's 14th movie role that I know of, she co-stars with notable actors Barbara Stanwyck, Robert Ryan, Paul Douglas and a young Keith Andes (Tora! Tora! Tora!). It's set a in small fishing village with the owner of a fishing boat, (Paul Douglas), and a young man (Keith Andes) who is dating a young Marilyn Monroe (Peg). One day, Joe (Keith Andes) comes home to find his sister Mae (Barbara Stanwyck) standing on his front porch. The movie is full of drama between all of the cast members. Mae, not knowing what she really wants in a man, marries Jerry, but ultimately finds that the life she married into may not be for her. She is introduced one day to Earl (Robert Ryan) who is Jerry's friend at a local hangout bar/grill restaurant. After that, things take a turn in the relationship department with Mae. She gets pregnant and has a baby with Jerry, but finds that the daily routine of a wife and mother may be too much for her. She decides to tangle with Earl and basically deserts Jerry and her baby Gloria for her new found lover Earl. Jerry learns of this behind his back and takes revenge vowing they will never have Gloria even attempting to kill Earl at his place of employment. Mae realizes it can never work with Earl and the fact that leaving her daughter for her whims with another man is a big mistake.
 She comes back to Jerry on his boat and basically pleads with him. He doesn't want to hear it at first but opens up and gives her another chance at life with him and her daughter, Gloria.

 This is a really good drama with good cast! Marilyn, in her big year of 1952, gives a good co-starring role. You get to see her before the megastar that she would become in 1953 with Twentieth Century Fox. Barbara and the rest of the cast did a great job as well with chemistry running good between them all, especially between Robert Ryan and Barbara Stanwyck.

788342,5,6304119089,"I liked a lot this 1952 black and white film. It must be said however, that this is a ""classical"" drama, and definitely NOT A FILM NOIR! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS!

The story takes place in fishing town of Monterey, California. Joe Doyle (Keith Andes) is a hardworking, tough young fisherman, dating a cheerful drop-dead gorgeous girl named Peggy (Marilyn Monroe). In the first scenes of the film his long estranged older sister Mae (Barbara Stanwyck) returns, penniless and defeated by life, to her home town - and Joe simply knows that trouble will follow her, as it always did...

Men in Monterey are of course immediately very much interested by Mae - including Jerry D'Amato (Paul Douglas). Jerry is a good-natured, unsophisticated fisherman, but he is good at what he does, owns already his boat and is well on his way to own a couple more. Then Mae meets also Jerry's best friend, Earl Pfeiffer (Robert Ryan), a bitter, deeply unhappy and rather unpleasant film projectionist - and then the film really begins.

Let's say it again - this is NOT A FILM NOIR! There will be no gangsters, no cops, no cons, no private investigators and no guns. This is actually a very well filmed and very well narrated social drama and the title of the review resumes pretty well the main core of the story.

Fritz Lang was a great visionary director, one of the greatest who ever lived - in fact maybe even THE GREATEST - and it shows in this film. Quite a lot of images of this fishing town are included in the story and by typical Lang'ian magic they contribute a lot to this film, even if the place is as unappealing as they come, especially the big fish processing factory, in which Peggy works.

The film is an adaptation of a successful 1941 play and therefore its main strength are excellent dialogs - as well as brilliant performance by all the five main actors. Amongst the secondary characters the most important and the most precious for the success of the film is Vince (J. Carrol Naish), Jerry's uncle, who really is a case, albeit the jury is still out on the question which sector of public service (judicial? medical? sanitation? all of the above?) this case belongs to...)))

Young Marilyn Monroe had ultimately not so much screen time in this film, but she is absolutely WONDERFUL! One of the reasons why she did so well in this film is probably because she USED TO BE the character she plays - indeed in 1945, at a time when her name was Norma Jean Dougherty, she did work in a factory. Barely a year later she was going finally to hit it big with ""Niagara"" and ""How to marry a millionaire"".

However this is the main trio that really shines in this film. Barbara Stanwyck, in those times Hollywood's top uber-bitch, plays here a slightly less venomous version of her usual characters - and she does very well. Paul Douglas, an actor much less known than his famous partners, plays here probably the role of his life. As for Robert Ryan, he is just PERFECT - and his role was not an easy one, as his character is really VERY complicated...

I really liked this film. It is a very dramatic thing, in which we are - very deservedly - very concerned for what will happen to all those people, who, even if they are all very flawed, somehow connect with us immediately... I must however say, that I didn't buy the ending. AT ALL! But I cannot be more specific here, because it would be saying too much. You will have to discover the ending by yourself.

Bottom line, this is a VERY GOOD film, made very skilfully by a great director, with excellent actors and a very tense, dramatic atmosphere. To watch absolutely! ENJOY!",1416960000,,3658,4.555555555555555

788349,5,6304119089,"For me, the answer is, RELEVANCE. I'm new and very fascinated by this post-World War II genre. As a reference point, I would say that ""Out of the Past,"" ""Born to Kill,"" and ""Asphault Jungle"" are among the very best that I have seen thus far. In my opinion, ""Clash by Night"" (CBN) deserves to be in this group. I would give all the others mentioned 5 solid stars. However, CBN gets an additional star for what I will call ""timeless relevance.""

In it is portrayed almost every player in the seedy dynamic between men and women during the phase of life I commonly call ""mating season."" I found it all very sad and very well represented from Marilyn Monroe's fresh-faced optimism and push-back against gender bondage, to Paul Douglas' sweet, trusting nature, to Robert Ryan's anger and almost complete self-absorption. At the center of it all is Barbara Stanwyck's character, tired, world-weary, wiser and determined to settle down and make something of her life, but ultimately weaker than her deep and abiding discontent with the life she has been able to piece together.

All that was needed to set everything ablase was/is J. Carrol Naish's gossipy uncle Vince. Played out in every possible way, this is one of the main diseases that is destroying America. I imagine that in 1952, this was a cautionary tale to the chronically dissatisfied husbands and wives in post World War II America trying to reconstruct a sense of wholesomeness and normalcy in their lives and finding themselves sorely tempted in the other direction.

In the intervening 60 years since this movie was released, I think we can say without controversy that the cautionary tale was not heeded. In real life, Barbara Stanwyck's character does not come to her senses and patch things up. She walks... with the kid, and gets the house to boot. Or, it plays out the other way around and the husband proves too frail to resist his passions. Either way, everyone gets the lasting scares left by betrayal or failure to do what is right in the face of passions that will not submit to our better angels.

There are other things going on in America including drug addiction, and voluntary servitude in exchange for the things and the material life we crave, but cannot otherwise afford. But these thems and others can be the themes of other films. This one, on the other hand, does the best job I've seen in any era or genre in depicting life as it too often is in the kitchens and living rooms of America, no more perhaps than in other parts of the world. More's the pitty. It's not pretty, but closing our eyes does not seem to help at any level. See the film, empathize with ALL of the characters, and think what would have happened over the last 60 years, had this film been taken to heart, and become a staple in senior civics classes all across America. What we got instead was Sex Education classes, abortion mills, and cheap birth control to help us remake the world in accordance with our every uncontrollable urge and to avoid the natural consequences of our actions.",1359072000,3,3040,4.676635514018692
788350,5,6304119089,"'Clash By Night' is probably one of the best noir movies made. The main stars are undoubtably Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan, but, for me, Marilyn Monroe steals the whole show. This is her most natural screen performance and one which proves what a terrific and naturally talented actress she was before Hollywood moulded her into the 'blonde bombshell'. She was destined to be a female Brando or Dean. These are the kind of roles Marilyn wanted to play. This was a sign of great things to come. It's such a pity it wasn't meant to be.",1357776000,3,537,4.546391752577319

Opening night cast included Robert Ryan as Joe Doyle (Monroe's boyfriend in the film), Joseph Schildkraut as Earl, Lee J. Cobb as Jerry and Tallulah Bankhead as Mae.

Fritz Lang directed this drama set in a West Coast fishing village. After some years away, Mae Doyle (Stanwyck) unhappily returns home. In desperation and boredom, she marries boat operator Jerry D'Amato (Douglas), a good-natured simple bear of a man. Feeling stifled by domesticity, Mae gets involved in a torrid affair with Earl Pfeiffer (Ryan). When Jerry finds he's been betrayed, it tears their marriage apart. Mae must decide if she wants an uncertain future with the passionate Earl or the stability of life with Jerry and their baby girl.

788512,5,6304119089,"You haven't experienced on-screen violence until you have seen Marilyn Monroe's 'Peggy' being choked by the man who loves her, in public.  Nor, the sure-to-erupt, thinly-disguised aggression of Mae's husband, Jerry.  Come to think about it, the only one of the men who probably wouldn't be physicially violent is the empty Joe, who says he hates women, but ... naw.. he wouldn't beat women up, he'd only suck out their souls.

No matter how you look at it, these women are better off alone.

The smoldering, and outright violence of the men toward women rates this film as one of the most unnervingly violent my friend and I have ever seen.

The sardine fishing and canning documentary is a wonderful historic gift.

A note to Peter Bogdanovich -- Stanwyck's Mae was in a slip because it was a burning hot night, and later, because that was the stage at which she was dressing.  No reason to read more into that than is necessary.  One more thing - I think you made it plain, after one mention, that Lang had it in for Monroe.  You keep mentioning that Monroe forgot her lines... Lang bitches about that.. he just hated her - that's quite clear.",1327536000,2,1145,4.600985221674877

Lang's direction is much better than Odets' play, from the documentary-like shots of fishing boats that open the flick, to the short, neat tracking shots in the cramped interiors. Also punctuated by powerful extreme close-ups: J. Carrol Naish egging Paul Douglas to violence with spiteful gossip and a tortured Robert Ryan advancing ever closer to the camera until the frameline bisects his face. Stanwyck's bitter monologues about the hopelessness of housewife life are scene-chew-rific, and it's fun seeing an early Monroe role as a spunky tomboy who doesn't yet talk like a breathy baby. 7/10",1320364800,2,793,5.508196721311475
788514,2,6304119089,"""Clash by Night"" is a 1952 black and white morality play. It was based on the hit Clifford Odets 1941 play that starred Tallulah Bankhead, Robert Ryan, and Lee J. Cobb. It is often mistaken for film noir because it was made in the classic film noir period, with two of the best film noir actors around - Robert Ryan and Barbara Stanwyck, and directed by the film noir doyen himself Fritz Lang, with music and photography by film noir stalwarts Roy  Webb and Nicholas Musuraca. But the film itself has none of the characteristics of film noir, despite its pedigree.

Lang (1890-1976) was called the ""Master of Darkness"" by the BFI. More than anyone else he popularized the German school of expressionist film (""Dr. Mabuse"", ""Metropolis"", ""M""). Though he wasn't a Jew, Lang fled Germany in 1934, and eventually came to the US where he made such notable films as ""Fury"" (1936), ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), ""Western Union"" (1940), ""Hangman Also Die"" (1943), ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944), and ""Scarlet Street"" (1945). While he was never nominated for an Oscar, his work influenced the work of many directors, including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

Sultry Barbara Stanwyck (1907-90) made more than 80 films and was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (""Stella Dallas"", ""Ball of Fire"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sorry Wrong Number""). She won 3 Emmys (""The Barbara Stanwyck Show"", ""Big Valley""). AFI lists her as # 11 among the ""Top 100 Greatest Screen Legends"". She plays a world weary woman who comes home after 10 years and despite her best judgment, marries Paul Douglas hoping to find happiness.

Everyman Paul Douglas (1907-59) is probably best known for his role as the baseball manager in ""Angels in the Outfield"" (1951), although I think his TV work in the early 50s best showcases his great acting skills. Douglas plays a fisherman who marries Stanwyck and tries to build a life with her, knowing that she does not love him but willing to settle for what he can get.

Sexy Robert Ryan (1909-73) co-stars as Douglas' best friend and the third leg of a romantic triangle. He made nearly 100 films between 1940 and 1973. In his early years he often played a villain especially in film noir dramas (""Crossfire"", ""Act of Violence"", ""The Set Up""), then transitioned into the tough guy with a good heart role (""On Dangerous Ground"").  My personal favorite Ryan role is Deke Thornton in ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969).

Marilyn Monroe (1926-62) has a brief role as a local girl and does a fine job This was her 17th film and followed similar brief but notable roles in ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950) and ""All About Eve"" (1950). Later this same year she would make ""Don't Bother to Knock"" which was her first major role, although in  this film she has her name ""above the line"" for the first time .

The musical score from Roy Webb (1888-1982) is excellent, a great example of how music can supplement the story without imposing. Webb is best known from his work with Val Lewton, though he worked on more than 200 films and was nominated for an Oscar 6 times between 1938 and 1946.

Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca (1892-1975) was a master of the film noir visuals (e.g., ""Stranger on the 3rd Floor"", ""Cat People"", ""Out of the Past""). Musuraca was another Lewton graduate and worked with Lang on ""The Blue Gardenia"" (1952). Unfortunately, while the black and white photography is OK, Musuraca shows none of his great skills in this film. Ironically he received an Oscar nomination for his work on ""I Remember Mama"" (1948).

The top grossing films in 1952 were ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", ""Ivanhoe"", and ""Singing in the Rain"".  ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" won for Best Picture and other Oscar winners were ""High Noon"" (Actor), ""The Quiet Man"" (Director), ""Come Back Little Sheeba"" (Actress), and ""Viva Zapata"" (Supporting Actor). Other memorable films that year were ""Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd"", Tracy and Hepburn as ""Pet and Mike"", Fritz Lang's ""Rancho Nororious"", ""The Red Planet Mars"", ""Scaramouche"", and Marion Cooper's ""This is Cinerama"".

The NY Times said the ""cast was fine, as were several of his scenes,"" but the film ""lacks conviction and distinction despite its hard-working principals."" Nonetheless, the film came in as #20 in the box office for the year.

Bottom line - Fans of film noir should steer clear of the film. This is a tedious morality play where the excellent acting, fine photography, and good musical score are unable to overcome the plodding direction and the poor script.",1315958400,3,4566,4.852185089974293

10/08: Clash by Night starts off with a slow first half before picking up the pace and ends well at a high note.

The performances rendered by Barbara Stanwyck (whom I doubt that she put in that much of an effort), Robert Ryan (who can do better), Marilyn Monroe (in a limited role), and Keith Andes (who got lucky despite his limitations and would commit suicide a few years ago) are fine, but it's Paul Douglas who steals the show. I feel for his character and can sympathize with him.

Fritz Lang's direction isn't that bad, but he tends to waste a lot of time on trivial things like seagulls, fish, and seals and the secondary characters.

Also, there is no way that a pretty girl like Marilyn Monroe would work in a fish factory. Come on, please.

For a while, I had strongly considered a rating of '4' for Clash by Night until I began to see the central point of the film. By the way, it is not really a film noir, but it's very heavy in drama.

I had a hard time believing in Mae Doyle's attraction to Earl due to his smarmy leechlike personality. Had Robert Ryan been replaced by Lawrence Tierney or maybe Marlon Brando, I would have believed it more.

The message that Clash by Night sends, in order to save a relationship, is to straighten out the priorities and ease down the selfishness; in short, it is a reverse version of A Doll's House.

All in all, Clash by Night is a solid drama picture with superb performances.",1290816000,2,1454,4.379182156133829
788518,4,6304119089,"This is a review of CLASH BY NIGHT (1952)which was directed by Fritz Lang and released by RKO Pictures. CLASH BY NIGHT was released on DVD by Turner Home entertainment in 2007.

In CLASH BY NIGHT Mae Doyle, played by Barbara Stanwyck, returns home to the small  west coast fishing village she left a couple of years before when she went to New York City.  She comes back with a ""wised up"" attitude having lost her dreams for a happy life with the man of her dreams and now content to settle for a pleasant if non-exciting existance.

Mae Doyle moves back into the family home, now owned by her fisherman brother, Keith Andes, who works on a boat owned by his friend, Jerry D'Amato, played by Paul Douglas.  Mae and Jerry hit it off and niave Jerry is more smitten than Mae but she is practical enough to see a future with the large,  gruff, fisherman. But Jerry makes the mistake of introducing Mae to his friend, the town's movie projectionist, Earl Pfeiffer, played by Robert Ryan.  Earl is a cynic and not shy around Mae, not by a long shot. After a year, Mae and Jerry get married but Earl's wife leaves him and Mae hooks up with Earl for an extramarital affair.

Once again we are gently dunked into the pool of noirish despair, surrounded by the darkness of the bad choices made by the leading characters of this dark and disturbing film and struggling to get out of this terrible situation without doing anything to make evverything worse.  Because of that,  CLASH BY NIGHT may be one of Fritz Lang's least popular later films, despite the presence of the young Marilyn Monroe playing a young woman trying to learn about life from these somewhat less than admirable characters.

CLASH BY NIGHT is worth seeing if you are into noir, Fritz Lang, or feeling maybe a little TOO optimistic. Actually, despite its lack of popularity, CLASH BY NIGHT is a very good film and well worth seeing.

I give it Four Stars.",1284768000,3,1915,4.518840579710145
788618,5,6304119089,"If you like to see crude men get slapped in the face as only Barbara Stanwyck can do it, this movie is the one for you. Clash By Night is a noir-ish film filled with snappy repartee. Urban girl, Mae Doyle (BS) returns to the lazy fishing village of her childhood to lick the wounds of her complicated life. She marries oaf-ish Jerry, (Paul Douglas) for the serenity and security that kind of simple life will provide.  They have a child and Mae soon gets bored, her irritation complicated by the muggy, summer heat. I am of and age to remember when women went around in their one-piece white slips and men in their tank undershirts to beat the summer heat, and alot of this goes on in the movie. This is an excellent ""bored woman has affair with someone far beneath her husband (Robert Ryan) drama,"" complete with alcoholic rantings by more than one player. Waves crash violently on the shore as we await their fates. Marilyn Monroe, sporting a modified poodle hair-do, sizzles as Mae's young sister-in-law. Paul Douglas always plays oaf as only a true non-oaf can do--and he steals the show.",1275091200,3,1092,4.6

788621,4,6304119089,"First of all it is worthwhile to see this movie, which is something in between of Film Noir and Neorealism. All the actors do their best, and this movie was directed by legendary Fritz Lang. Barbara Stanwyk is absolutely cool in her leading role and Marilyn Monroe has one of her biggest pre-fame roles and is luminous in a unique earth-bound role. Very interesting is the commentary of Peter Bogdanovich with excerpts from an old Fritz Lang interview. I would have given five points if the picture only had a better resolution. It seems as if the DVD was made from an American video tape with less pictures per minute, so if people move quick, the picture is not flowing any more. Then it would have been nice to have as an addition the existing German soundtrack, not only French and Spanish. I hope that one day there will be made a better copy. Especially for Germans it would be very interesting, as this good movie is not very well known in Germany. Although a German version exists under the title ""Vor dem neuen Tag!"" it has never been shown on television as far as I can remember.",1249776000,2,1089,4.505050505050505
788622,3,6304119089,"Barbara Stanwyck, Paul Douglas, Robert Ryan and Marilyn Monore: wow, not a bad leading foursome of actors! I bought this because it was labeled a film noir, and I am always willing to give them a chance. Plus, with this cast, it sounded good. It turned out to be only fair because it was more of a soap opera than a noir. I guess the presence of some amoral people and a lot of wise-cracking lines made it be considered ""noir.""

The ""amoral"" people were played by Stanwyck and Ryan, of course.....who else? They are effective in those roles, too, but they should be since those two fine actors played those roles on numerous occasions. Douglas plays the simpleton good guy who gets shafted by his wife Stanwyck who has an affair with Ryan.

Monroe and her boyfriend (played by Keith Andes) have a smaller role but are just as fascinating a couple, of not ore so than the leads. The final third of this movie didn't match up the first two-thirds or this would be rated at least a four-stars simply because of the great dialog in that first hour. There were so many good lines I couldn't count them all. I just wish it had stayed that way all the way thorough.

The fishing docks of San Francisco certainly was a different site, too, for a noir. To me, this should be simply classified as a ""drama"" or even ""melodrama.""",1233705600,5,1317,4.433884297520661

788624,5,6304119089,"Barbara Stanwyck is one of the greatest actresses of all time, ""Stella Dallas"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" and ""Christmas in Connecticut"" being her best.  This powerful film is right up there with all of those.

Set in the time it was made, in the fishing village of Monterrey, California, we are given a glimpse of the rough-and-tumble everyday lives of blue-collar workers.  It's kind of depressing, like Pensacola, Florida.  Poor people fight loudly and don't have a lot of class, like Robert Ryan with his Asian impersonation (which even I, who enjoy an ethnic joke every now and then, who doesn't?, thought was offensive).  But then, that was totally in character of him to do so, being the ne'er-do-well drifter he was.  The only reason Stanwyck slept with him was out of boredom and he was probably good in the sack, too (she had slept with a politician, after all); Paul Douglas, though sweet, was probably too gentle for her.  She liked 'em rough and dangerous.

The imagery in this was stunning (some would say including Marilyn Monroe, but I never thought she was that good-looking--give me Jean Simmons anyday).  I used to think Marilyn couldn't act, but it was obvious once she became famous, they put her in garbage like ""Gentleman Prefer Blondes"" and the like, but her performance in ""Niagara"" and ""Don't Bother to Knock"", the latter, although not one of my favorite films, was one of her best performances because she was essentially playing herself.

Anyway, back to my review.  The moral of the story is that just because we say we're this or that, warning people that this is the way we are, you'll just have to take me as I am, isn't a license to hurt people, because Mae still chose to marry Jerry and make a baby with him and whether she likes it or not, Gloria (the baby) is her responsibility now and she owes it to Jerry to try to work things out.  She wouldn't be happy with Earl and she knows it, because even though she may think she loves him, he was just convenient, just as she was for him.  I think he just liked sticking it to Jerry, who he had no respect for because he saw him as weak.  He preyed upon Mae's dissatisfaction with her oppressive life.

Keith Andes (who is a dead ringer for Skip Homeier, who appeared in a few ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" episodes) played her boorish, and probably physically abusive brother, who marries Marilyn, finishes off this great cast.  This film is in my top twenty-five of the greatest movies ever, I cannot recommend it enough.  It draws you in and holds you there, and makes you think about it long after the credits have rolled.  Wonderful, wonderful film.",1223769600,5,2650,4.650214592274678
788625,3,6304119089,"After a decade on her own in the big city, Mae Doyle (Barbara Stanwyck) returns to her hometown which is a sleepy fishing village in Coastal California. Listless, bored, and broke, she eventually drifts into a marriage to Jerry D'Amato (Paul Douglas), hoping he will provide her with some security and safety. But Mae soon realizes she wants more excitement and passion, which her fisherman husband is oblivious to.

Before long sparks fly between Mae and Jerry's ne'er-do-well friend Earl (Robert Ryan) Now torn between a ''bad boy'' lover and a boring husband and infant at home, Mae's life careens out of control. She finds that her exciting new lover not only does not offer her much satisfaction either, but leaving a loving husband and infant daughter arouses some long-buried emotions.

''Clash by Night'' is classified as a Film Noir but to me it seemed more like a drama. The plot is pretty straight forward and somewhat predictable. Director Fritz Lange adds in some Film Noir-like elements such as scenes at night, smoky bars, and men fighting over a blonde, but there is not much element of danger.

The acting is good but nothing extraordinary, including Paul Douglas' performance as Stanwyck's dull-but kind husband. Stanwyck herself is good in the film, but not as smoldering as in ''Double Indemnity'' There is a small part in the film by Marilyn Monroe as a naive but fun-loving gal who marries Mae's brother.

Overall I thought ''Clash By Night'' was a solid 3-star film but not much more. The plot is somewhat interesting but similar to so many other films I have seen. And the passion between the characters did not always ring true. Also, some of the actors just didn't look the part of rough-edged fishermen. If you are a big fan of any of the actors in the film you may enjoy it, but I've seen much better films in this genre.",1222992000,,1849,4.750778816199377

Stanwyck returns home from New York to rekindle her unhappy love life by marrying a steady rock of a fisherman played by Paul Douglas, but she really wants the wild and daring projectionist played by Robert Ryan. After the birth of their daughter, Douglas is enraged to discover they are having an affair and she wants to leave him. Here is where a snail seemed to take over the script and write as many corny metaphors to avoid any decisive conclusion whatsover. At least they could have brought Marilyn Monroe back during the last half hour of hysterical monologues to wake me up. Couldn't Douglas stop asking ""what if"" and just strangled Ryan in the projection booth? The storybook ending only added to my boredom with the second half.
Marilyn Monroe does nicely in her role as a tough cannery worker fighting off her abusive fiance (Stanwyck's brother}.  Ocean waves roll in during suspenseful points in the film but nothing happens.

788627,5,6304119089,"Mae Doyle (Barbara Stanwyck), a woman who once had big-city ambitions for a wealthy marriage, is forced to come back to her home town in defeat and has resigned herself to a drab marriage to  decent, but boring Jerry D'Amato. It was only a matter of time before she falls for Jerry's friend Earl. Earl's better looking than Jerry and shares Mae's longing for a larger life. Like so many supposedly politically progressive social dramas of the time, Odet's play overly valorizes working-class men and ridicules women who have legitimate reasons to be dissatisfied with their dreary lives and their husbands' sometimes brutal behavior towards them. Mae probably should have stayed in the city and gotten a job instead of resigning herself to this glum marriage, but now that she has a baby that's water under the bridge. Her life is so impoverished that when Earl buys her rayon nightgowns, she keeps them in the gift box and hides them in the bottom of the dresser like a special treat. Marilyn Monroe plays her friend Peggy--a girl who, unlike Mae, has an easier time resigning herself to a small-town life with a man who compensates for his low social status by putting down women and being the ""man"" of the house. But Mae expects more from life.

Fritz Lang's direction and Stanwyck's nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of Mae give this film an emotional complexity that puts it a cut above the usual kitchen sink melodrama. Mae goes back to her husband (after Earl shows that he's a heel with no interest in raising her child), but it's no happy ending.  The film's tentative and unfinished ending gives the film a contemporary feel and poses an unanswered question that Odets and his left-wing male counterparts of the time were largely unwilling to face--their own stereotyped and demeaning attitudes towards women.",1195257600,2,1819,4.880258899676376

788754,5,6304119089,"Most reviewers of this film seem to have 'gotten it' with respect to the film's undeniable stance in both Robert Ryan and Fritz Lang's careers. Both celebrities enjoy considerable cult status, and they united for the film, which, along with Barbara Stanwyck's jaded portrait of a fallen woman, achieved a cinema realism that was rare in those days. The film was another example of RKO's attempts to bring outstanding films to the screen. One would be hard pressed to find another studio that so consistently sought artistic merit, dissimilar from studios like Warner Brothers, which catered more to mass interest.

The love triangle involving Ryan, Stanwyck and Paul Douglas, seems entirely plausible then and now. It is amazing to see that the sexual attraction between Ryan and Stanwyck was conveyed without the de rigueur explicit romp in the hay that predominates any film made in the last thirty years. If the viewer wants to see some real sexual tension without the overtness viewers are subjected to these days to get them to watch what's out there, simply watch the scene in which Ryan and Stanwyck engage in a short but heated embrace. One doesn't need to see anything more than Stanwyck's hand clutching Ryan's bare back underneath his T-shirt to envision what happens next.

The addition of secondary players, Marilyn Monroe and Keith Andes, likewise didn't need to achieve its sexual effect in the blatant manner employed in films these days. J. Carrol Naish's devilish Uncle Vince was also a tour de force for this wonderful character actor, and Silvio Minciotti effectively portrayed Paul Douglas's lonely widowed father.

Add to these dynamics a wonderful screenplay, sharply written and without a maudlin word to it. Lang's direction is, without question, faultless, and I can't think of a false move anywhere in the film. Paul Douglas ably portrays the thankless role of the cuckolded husband, and he engenders sympathy for his trusting nature.

However, above all, this is an example of another RKO film in which Robert Ryan's presence elevates the proceedings from a B grade to an A+ grade. The scene in which he is seen at his most intensely lonely moment needs to be seen to be appreciated, when his character, the lonely Earl Pfeiffer, is scorned by Stanwyck's Mae Doyle at her wedding. His descent downstairs at the wedding reception is a classic 'Ryan' vignette of him enacting the quintessential 'film noir' spirit of desperate loneliness, a scene that sticks in one's mind far into the future after the movie is over. In fact, every scene involving Ryan is amazing, and it doesn't seem possible that anyone could find fault with his performance, unless their judgment is seriously lacking.",1164412800,11,2715,5.026666666666666

When the uncle and dad were talking in one scene they were discussing the discovery of an abandoned baby.  I thought this baby would later turn out to be Ms. Stanwycks which she had left for dead after her previous affair with the married man.  The ending was also a disappointment.

788756,4,6304119089,"""Clash By Night"" is a movie from the ""film noir"" genre that appears to have been written for Barbara Stanwyck to play the lead. We're lucky that the studio system of the 50's didn't have the same standards as today - casting actresses aside as ""too old"" as soon as they appear old enough to legally drink. Such a standard would have deprived us of some of the finest performances of Bette Davis, Katherine Hepburn, and of course, Barbara Stanwyck, this being one of her finest but less known performances. For that matter, the casting of the entire picture is just perfect.

Ms. Stanwyck plays Mae, a woman who left her home town of Monterrey ten years earlier in search of love and adventure, fell in love with a married man who died on her, and was cast aside by the man's legitimate family and friends. Thus she returns home hardened and cynical, with a less than warm welcome from her long lost brother, Joe. Jerry, played by Paul Douglas, is a fisherman, large both in body and in heart, who falls in love with Mae, but seems somewhat emotionally needy. Mae reluctantly decides to marry him because she is seeking stability. After a year or so of marriage and the birth of a daughter, Mae realizes she feels trapped in her dull routine of a marriage. The love that gives the daily routine of life meaning to most people is just not there for her, although Jerry adores her. Earl, played by Robert Ryan, is Jerry's ""friend"" and is also a kindred spirit of Mae's. He, too, has been kicked around in life and has developed a hard and cynical outlook. He has everything that Jerry lacks, but seems to lack everything that Jerry has, starting with decency and a strong work ethic. Mae realizes that Earl is bad for her, but ultimately loses her fight in being attracted to him. The fact that Mae is his best friend's wife doesn't stop Earl from seducing Mae in Jerry's own home, and then carrying on a clandestine affair with Mae for months, until clueless Jerry is alerted to the situation by his nimrod uncle.

Confronted by her husband, Mae must choose between the two men, and probably most definitely would have chosen Earl over Jerry if it had not been for her daughter. This is the most forced part of the plot development. We don't just see Mae deciding to stay with Jerry because of her daughter. Instead, she seems to have a complete about face in attitude that comes out of nowhere. The film would have us believe that the change came from hearing her own callous attitudes coming from the lips of her lover, but then she's probably been hearing these kinds of words from him for the last several months that they have been carrying on their affair, so this epiphany does not make a lot of sense.

Some parts of this movie are timeless - love and security versus passion and danger, dealing with the consequences of one's actions, and how life's inevitable disappointments make some people hard and cynical. However, some are dated - the most prominent example being Mae's brother Joe and his relationship with his fiancee, Peggy, played by a young Marilyn Monroe. Joe might have appeared as a man who was taking charge of his situation in his rough treatment of Peggy in 1952, but over 50 years later he comes across as a wife batterer in the making.

This movie is probably best classified as a film noir epic, although that term usually refers to crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic. Although that definitey fits the view of the world offered here, this is a psychological melodrama rather than a crime drama. However, the movie does have the low-key black-and-white visual style that is typical of the film noir genre. I recommend the movie, but as another reviewer already remarked, you might get a better total value buying one of the boxed sets that includes this film.",1157068800,7,3853,4.62043795620438

Barbara Stanwyck plays hardened woman who returns to hometown where good-boy Paul Douglas meets, squires and marries her.  Best friend bad-boy Robert Ryan has plans of his own, though.

 As usual, Stanwyck nails it as the bad-girl who knows she's bad but wants to reform and enjoy the good life fishing boat captain Douglas can provide.  Ryan pretty much keeps pace with her from the mean end of the love triangle.  Douglas is... well... Jerry D'Amato is supposed to be a big, nave, uncomprehending lug whose love is whole-hearted and, unfortunately, blind.  This is a sticky melodrama and Douglas simply isn't very convincing.  In fact, he goes over the top a time or three and practically beaches this trawler on his own.  I've watched this one twice, first al dente and the second time, weeks later, with the Peter Bogdanovich commentary track.  Both times, when it came time for Douglas to play his big `betrayed' scenes I couldn't help wondering what William Bendix (Yes, Douglas WAS that painful to watch), or, more perfectly, what Broderick Crawford would have done with the role. That Douglas's flounderings don't sink this one has more to do with the offsetting strength of Stanwyck and Ryan and the welcome presence of a young Marilyn Monroe in a minor role than with any compensating strengths on his part.

 I'm not giving a strong four stars to CLASH BY NIGHT.  More like 3.500001 stars.  The Monterrey location adds welcome authenticity to the story and Bogdanovich's commentary (with archived audio tape comments by the director, Fritz Lang) helpfully explains Lang's technique and approach.  Although this movie is bundled in a film noir collection it doesn't revolve around a crime or contain a whole lot of thrills.  It has a bad-boy and a bad-girl who probably have a basketful of Freudian issues, but they don't bubble to the surface in the traditional noir fashion.  Noir... I mean `nor' do I remember the shadow of a venetian blind falling across any agonized face.

Boats come in with their catch; their crews unload the fish; and the cannery processes them. It's a memorable sequence, and I was surprised to find it in this relationship drama. Mae Doyle (Barbara Stanwyck) has returned to town after a 10-year absence that left her disillusioned with life, love and the plans she had. Her brother Joe (Keith Anders) works on a fishing boat owned by Jerry D'Amato (Paul Douglas), a cheerful, simple-minded man who is smitten with Mae. Joe's good friend Earl Pfeiffer (Robert Ryan) couldn't be more different.  He's misogynistic, lecherous, and deeply needy. Mae is attracted and repulsed by the cynicism that she sees in Earl and shares with him. She'd like a man like Jerry to take care of her, but knows she could never be satisfied with that.

""Clash by Night"" is based on the play by Clifford Odets, and it's fun to try to pick out the lines that sound like Odets by their affectedness. Usually the actors deliver the lines casually, so they don't sound too histrionic. I found that the film's strength is its documentary-like qualities, which don't end after the introductory sequence. The vignettes of working class life and conversations about family matters lend the film an authenticity that it really needs considering that Barbara Stanwyck' s glamour and forcefulness seem as out of place in that town as her character professes to feel. Robert Ryan was a terrific character actor who could just as easily be sympathetic or loathsome, and he's convincingly obnoxious here. It's not clear if Earl is suffering from feelings of inferiority or superiority, but he's an overbearing, moody, insufferable jerk. ""Clash by Night"" was the first film in which Marilyn Monroe had billing above the title. She's beautiful and youthful as Joe's feisty girlfriend Peggy, even if she had trouble with her lines, as Fritz Lang claimed. ""Clash by Night"" is a bit of melodrama, I suppose, in which people's needs and desires clash with life's realities. But strong performances and a realistic environment make it an interesting film.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): There is an occasional flaw, but this is generally a good print. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2  minutes) and an audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich and Fritz Lang. Most of the commentary is Bogdanovich. Occasional brief contributions from Lang were recorded by Peter Bogdanovich in 1965 when he was interviewing Lang for his book ""Fritz Lang in America"". It's a good commentary in which Bogdanovich provides scene-by-scene comments on the actors, characters, dialogue, filming anecdotes, and, of particular interest to me, analysis of some of the longer shots and cuts. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French.",1124928000,34,3089,5.098814229249012
788761,4,6304119089,"This review is for the 2005 Warner Brothers DVD.

The storyline revolves around Mae Doyle (Barbara Stanwick) who returns to a Northern California fishing community after a ten-year hiatus.  She left that town hoping to find a wealthy or prestigious man to marry, but her dreams never materialized.  Upon returning she runs into an old acquaintance, Jerry D'Amato (Paul Douglas), at a bar and they later start dating even though they have very little in common.  Jerry is hardworking and stable, yet a boring simpleton.  Mae is fickle and shallow.  Jerry introduces Mae to his best friend Earl (Robert Ryan) who is cantankerous yet very extroverted - pretty much the exact opposite of Jerry.  From this point on in the movie, the human dynamics these three people go all over the map and develop into an enthralling plot for the viewer.

I was initially taken off guard with the way the film ended, but I couldn't get it out of my head for the rest of the day and realized it took a very brave direction with the issues it confronted.  Furthermore, the movie is probably more representative of today's social landscape than it was when the film was made and has some hard-hitting commentary for the consequences of people's actions.  There is however, one scene that is clearly politically incorrect by today's standards where Earl imitates a Chinese person.  The movie also contained some refreshing scenes of a young Marilyn Monroe who plays the girlfriend of Mae's brother. Overall I give the film a solid recommendation for viewing.

The DVD is remastered but not restored and as a result, the black and white transfer is sharp but occasionally tiny spots of film deterioration can be observed.  The sound is fine.  The DVD comes with commentary by Peter Bogdanovich, with audio interview excerpts of director Fritz Lang.

PLEASE NOTE:  Before buying this DVD, consider buying the Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 2 which contains this movie plus four other highly recommended movies at a very reasonable price.

Pungent, brilliantly acted romantic melodrama about a world-weary woman (Barbara Stanwyck) who returns to the small fishing community where she was raised, and finds herself torn between the man she marries for security (Paul Douglas) and his embittered, iconoclastic best friend (Robert Ryan).  Adapted from a stage play by Clifford Odets, ""Clash by Night"" offered Stanwyck one of her best roles of the early 1950's, and she responded by delivering a richly textured, superbly nuanced performance that won her the year's Laurel Award from the Motion Picture Exhibitors of America.  The always interesting Ryan was shown to good advantage as Stanwyck's emotionally stunted lover, and the film also provided meaty supporting roles to newcomer Keith Andes and rising star Marilyn Monroe as Stanwyck's rough-edged brother and his spirited girlfriend.  Tightly directed by master craftsman Fritz Lang, the movie also benefits from Nicholas Musuraca's expert cinematography (much of the movie was filmed on location in Monterrey, CA) and Roy Webb's moody musical score.

In terms of video quality, the DVD presentation of this taut drama is just barely  acceptable, and certainly not up to Warner Home Video's usual high standard.  Various sections of the film are plagued with black lines of vertical noise running up and down the screen, and some scenes feature poorly rendered black and white contrast.  Having previously owned VHS and LaserDisc releases of this title, I can attest that there exist better prints from which WHV might have mastered the DVD.  The disc also includes the rarely seen Original Theatrical Trailer, and a very interesting commentary track by director and film historian Peter Bogdanovich who introduces portions of an old (but fascinating) interview he once conducted with Fritz Lang regarding the making of the film.  Despite the annoying flaws in the master print, the quality of the movie itself and the wonderful bonus features on the disc make this DVD worthy of inclusion in your home library of classic movies.",1121040000,6,2091,5.303030303030303
788862,3,6304119089,"Despite the gorgeous location cinematography and the top-notch performances by the principle actors it cannot disguise the fact that this film is a potboiler that borders on mawkish soap opera.  That would be OK but Warner Brothers included this film in it's second film noir collection and I think it hardly qualifies as noir.  That said, see this film for the performances here by Barbara Stanwyck, Paul Douglas, and Robert Ryan who do their darndest to make this film more than it really is.  Up and comer Keith Andes(Who?) takes his shirt off.  Marilyn Monroe, essentially wasted here, does her requisite bikini scene.",1121040000,3,622,5.009708737864078
788863,5,6304119089,"In this affective triangle , this lowest micro cosmos illustrates the bitter portrait of many families in that age .

The gloomy memories of the WW2  not only sealed the end of the cycle in many marriages . A great amount of widows who must face the real life , but many teenagers in the early forties who lost his father and had to work in search of new plans of life .

From North to South , from West to East or vice versa , the decade 1945-1955 was in general a decade characterized by a profound uncertainness , an unconscious fear by the ghosts of the Cold War and besides an age of  hopeless in every emotional corner .

Many women undertook the same attitude of May Doyle searching for new dreams and hopes of redemption .

May knew the real world and somehow she is always five steps ahead the rest of his two pretenders : the candid Jerry who symbolized the way of thinking of certain social levels and the cynical and rebel guy Earl who defied the Status Quo and besides had a bitter deception in his marriage life .

So we have the dramatis personae : two disturbed  people who failed in their respective previous relationship and a gentile and kindly man who never abandoned his family , able to protect May for ever through the marriage .

In this order , the film will deal about the dense and troubled conceptions of the world and the life . Earl is not a good guy but somehow he has the experience and that is a very good point to May eyes who sees in Joe almost a protector instead a husband and a lover .

Earl means the risk and the adventure , but Jerry represents the security and the emotional equilibrium though without the taste of the risk .

The ambition and the crude vision of the life against the promise of a better tomorrow . She will bet for the last option and again this decision will lead her a decisive ethic crossroad .

Since some evident cuts we can appreciate by the hyper kinetic final the film gets what it planned .

A deep review of how to face with the life . Realize the parallel affective relation  Peggy and Joe who will enter in the marriage circle and the last warning given for Joe : I am not a new dress you decide to leave and search it again . If you decide to marry me it will be for ever . The message can not be more evident .

With a modest scenario but plenty of talent Fritz Lang built a solid and complex melodrama if you decide to watch with the actual patterns of  behaviour , but definitively consider this film as a moral fable and the historical time will be useless because it transcends the anecdote .

Solid performances of all the cast .",1104883200,2,2608,4.2152917505030185
788864,4,6304119089,"Clash by Night reminded me why I think of Barbara Stanwyck as one of my favorite actresses. She stands out in this movie as the depressed, hard boiled Mae Doyle who returns to her small fishing hometown after hitting a rough patch in the city. She meets two potential suitors; the likeable Jerry who she sees as security and the tempermental Earl who she immediately takes a dislike to because he is so much like herself.

She settles for security, and then quickly gets bored. This is an interesting movie that explores adultry, the reasons behind it, the lives it destroys and the reprecussions. This movie really brings into mind the idea of you don't know what you have until it's suddenly gone.

As I said earlier, Barbara Stanwyck is beautiful and wonderful as Mae. Robert Ryan as Earl is Mae's equivalent, and he is also terrific.

Of course I'm sure most people who watch this movie watch it with the interest of Marilyn Monroe, who plays Mae's affable sister-in-law. Monroe is good (especially in the part when her husband tells her his thoughts on marriage) but it's Stanwyck who shines in this movie.",1100131200,5,1111,4.716494845360825
788865,4,6304119089,"""Clash By Night"" is a great fifties movie. Barbara Stanwyck said in an interview once that she felt this movie came closest to exemplifying the European adult approach to movies made by adults, for adults. She was right. While the storyline might not be exactly great, Stanwyck and Robert Ryan are tough as nails and play their roles to perfection. This movie is so representative of the fifties dramas, it's a joy to watch. Great lines, great photography, great sets, and, of course, great acting, especially by Miss Stanwyck. See it, and be impressed.",1082937600,3,553,4.8936170212765955
788866,4,6304119089,"Although the emphasis here is on emotions rather than mayhem, fans of ""Film Noir"" will chew on Fritz Lang's ""Clash By Night"" with relish. What saves this film from becoming another weepy 50's melodrama are the cynical, tough-as-nails characters played by Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan. They are the illicit lovers cuckolding hubby Paul Douglas' naive, easygoing Monterey Bay fisherman. Ryan brings a sweat-streaked, smouldering, ""Streetcar Named Desire"" intensity to all of his scenes with Stanwyck, who holds her own as a restless, world-weary housewife with a ""been there done that"" past. Stanwyck and Ryan play out thier furtive romantic scenes like rutting animals (this is pretty hot stuff by early 50's standards). Paul Douglas gives his career-best performance, particularly when he registers heartbreak, betrayal, and internal struggle between gentle demeanor and homicidal rage all in one pivotal scene  (""ANIMALS! That's what you are...ANIMALS...!"")  Marilyn Monroe is excellent in a small but memorable role as Stanwyck's tomboyish sister-in-law. What makes this film unique in the Noir canon is that while there is a fair amount of violence, none of it is fatal in the literal sense. The only fatalities here are the characters' hopes, dreams and faith in humanity-now THAT's what I call Noir!",1044403200,15,1308,5.4068627450980395
788867,4,6304119089,"As a whole, this is not one of better films by any of the participants, but nonetheless this film is fascinating on several levels, and there are plenty of good reasons to see this.  First, Barbara Stanwyck once again proves she was almost incapable of being anything except exceptional.  Hands down, while I personally prefer her in comedy, I nevertheless believe she was the greatest film noir actress of all time.  She was also the greatest portrayer of ""bad girls"" film has seen.  In CLASH BY NIGHT, she plays a burned out bad girl, almost the female equivalent of the aging gunfighter in a Western, tired of being called out by every young gun in every town.  Stanwyck decides to marry Paul Douglas more because she is too exhausted to attempt anything else.  Paul Douglas is superb in his role of the man who is in love with Stanwyck, only to find tragic disappointment.  Robert Ryan is great as Douglas's friend who has tremendous chemistry with Stanwyck.  Personally, I have always thought that Ryan should have had a much better career than he did.  He was a superb actor with tremendous onscreen charisma.  Although he had several memorable roles, he never seemed to have that one role that put him into the rank of the top actors in Hollywood.  He had top shelf ability, but never quite made it to the top.  Marilyn Monroe was still a year away from superstardom, but she was enormously attractive in her small role.  Finally, the movie is worth seeing because it was directed by Fritz Lang.  This is not major Fritz Lang, but it is an interesting addition to a formidable body of work.
The setting for the film is quite remarkable.  In the 1940s and 1950s, very few films set on the West coast were not set in LA or San Francisco.  Viewing this film, you feel you are recovering a little bit of lost Americana, a scene from Steinbeck more than Hollywood.
All in all, this is not by any standard a great movie, but it is nonetheless a memorable one.  Besides, no movie starring Barbara Stanwyck ought to be ignored.",1040947200,4,2026,4.583333333333333
788868,3,6304119089,"This is the story of a woman who marries one man then falls for another. Nothing new here, and there's a lot of shouting in the process.
The best part about the movie has nothing to do with its plot, but rather with the setting. It was filmed in Monterey, California, during the heyday of Cannery Row. This makes it an interesting historical recond of a long gone era made famous by John Steinbeck. Opening scenes show the sardine canning process, from unloading the fishing boats to the final product. The whistle calling cannery worker Marilyn Monroe to the job was also depicted accurately. It is probably the best filmed record of this era that is available. Most of the buildings shown in the movie are long gone, but the houses where much of the action takes place are still standing at the south end of Cannery Row.",1040428800,7,822,4.5608108108108105
788869,4,6304119089,"The term 'film noir' may have been coined with CLASH BY NIGHT in mind.  This gritty film explores an underside of relationships that often got overlooked even then.  Barbara Stanwyck plays a jaded woman who left her small town fishing village ten years earlier to find some excitement that she felt sure was somewhere beyond the village limits.  She loved vainly and was hurt more than once, all the while growing a thicker shell that she used to protect herself from further hurt.  Then, one day she returns home, much to the surprise of her brother, played with a tough edge by Keith Andes, who makes it clear to her that he wishes she had never returned.  The first part of the movie focuses on Keith Andes' relationship with a young, pre-star Marylin Monroe, who despite her second tier status shows the smart, brassiness that was to mark both her film persona and her personal life. Andes is the brute who likes to dominate his women; Monroe is the equally tough-talking short-haired blonde who can give as well as get.  More than once she slaps Andes' face when he goes too far.  By the start of the second half, the dramatic center reshifts back to Stanwyck, who decides that the honest love of a good but cloddish Paul Douglas is preferable to the sort of uncertainty that had marked her previous search for a  foundation upon which she could build a life.  Enter Robert Ryan, an alcoholic yet sexy man whose obvious sensuality resonates with a Stanwyck who is torn between the good yet boring Douglas and Ryan.
The movie, in its twin examination of the Andes-Monroe and Stanwyck-Douglas pairings, suggests that relationships often grow or flounder on the basis of the strength of the commitments involved.  This strength to commit is necessarily influenced both by well-meaning if inept family members and by the willingness of the partners to place the welfare of the others above their own.  CLASH BY NIGHT emphasizes that those relationships that hope to survive a brutal clash of divergent personalities will do so, but the cost is sometimes too high to pay.  The emotional bills that Stanwyck and Monroe had to pay will, by the closing credits, be paid only in coin that was dearly earned.",1039219200,7,2203,4.753280839895013
788870,4,6304119089,"Interesting ""little"" 1950's film noir, with always terrific Stanwyck as the worn out bad girl who returns home, to what's left of her family, because she has nowhere else to go. Clifford Odets written morality tale, with as much dark, suggested sexual undercurrent as the early 1950's would allow. Set in the  atmospheric California fishing coast, ala ""Cannery Row"".  Especially interesting as early Marilyn Monroe vehicle. She is charasmatic and convincing as the simple and naieve but not stupid Peg, who is to marry Stanwycks characters brother, played by Keith Andes. Her innocent Peg is a perfect contrast to Stanwycks world-weary character. I always find Marilyns pre-star roles very interesting. Hind sight is 20/20, but to see her obvious talent and screen prescence, before she was an icon, it's easy to see that she was something special. She gives an excellant acting performance in this film, in which she was up against big-leaguers and old pros. This is the film M.M. was shooting when the news broke that she had posed for the then very scandalous nude calendar. Apparently the stars of this movie were getting irritated at all the focus on this little blonde girl, with one commenting ""That blonde... is getting all the publicity!"". Sometimes the ""smaller"" films can be more interesting than the big studio hits, and I consider this one of those. A moody, sensual movie, in the classic tradition of all those great black & white films of the 1940's & early '50's. Definatley worth a look.",1022976000,10,1504,4.964285714285714

7862419,5,6304119089,"Sometimes a little gem of a film, a black and white film from the 1950s like the one under review here, Clash by Night, just kind of sneaks up on you. Frankly in all the years I have been reviewing films I was totally unaware of this beauty although I admit that unlike other reviewers I have never been that enamored of the film noir genre and so missing it probably was not that serious a sin of omission. But if you think about the matter a bit when you put a serious star like Barbara Stanwyck (she of that ankle bracelet shot coming down the stairs in Billy Wilders screen adaptation of James M. Cains Double Indemnity which was enough to hook Walter, a convenient insurance salesman,  and lead him down the garden path, lead him to a couple of well-placed slugs in the gut too), gruff Paul Douglas, 1950s handsome Robert Ryan, and upcoming world icon Marilyn Monroe with top rank noir director Fritz Lang (think The Big Heat where Glenn Ford takes down a whole corrupt operation almost single-handedly) and a screenplay based on a hot shot playwright Clifford Odets (he of Golden Boy and Waiting For Lefty) you are bound to produce a great cinematic effort. Plus place the whole thing in olden days post-World War II Monterrey out in California when that town produced oodles of sardines-and John Steinbeck- and there you are.

The strongest part of this effort is the emotions that the interplay between the various lead players bring out in a story line that is frankly about ordinary people, their ordinary dreams, and their extraordinary passions and predilections. Those emotions get carried forth, create the clash of the title, in some of the strongest dialogue that I have seen produced in film about the travails of people who are pretty lost in their own small world. Let me explain that idea via a look at the plot-line something I have been doing more recently with older films that I have reviewed.

Mae, played by Ms. Stanwyck, has come home to working class Monterey after having been out in the big wide world and gotten her younger dreams crushed. She is now world weary and wary. She returns to her small family home where her brother, a commercial fisherman, remember old-time Monterey was the sardine capital of the world, is enthralled by Peggy, played by Marilyn Monroe, who is a lot more forgiving about the fate of a lost sister than he brother who nevertheless lets her stay. While keeping a low profile as something of a home body her brothers boat captain, Jerry, played by gruff and throaty Paul Douglas, a regular stiff comes a-courting. After a while, succumbing to a strong desire to have somebody take care of her, to be settled she accepts Jerrys offer of marriage. Even in accepting Jerrys proposal though she warned him that she was spoiled goods.

Things go along for a while with Jerry and Mae, about a year, during which they have a child, a baby girl, but Mae begins to get the wanderlust, begins to get antsy around the very ordinary and plebian Jerry. Enter Earl, or rather re-enter Earl, Jerrys friend, who had been interested in Mae from day one when Jerry introduced them. He, in the meantime, was now divorced and takes dead aim at Mae. And she takes the bait, falls hard for the fast-talking cynical Earl. They plan for Mae to fly the coop with the baby and a new life. Not so fast though once they confront Jerry with their affair, with his being cuckolded. This is where the dialogue gets right down to basics. Mae gives Jerry whats what about her and Earl, about her needs. Jerry, blinders off, builds up a head of steam and in another scene almost kills Earl before he realized what he was doing.

This is the pivot. Jerry takes the baby on his boat. Mae suddenly realizes that the baby means more to her than Earl who as it turned out didn't give a rats ass about the child. Having been once bitten though when Mae goes to Jerry to seek reconciliation he is lukewarm but as she turns to leave he relents. Maybe they can work things out, or at least that is the look on Maes face when she is brought back into the fold at the end of the film.  You really have to see this film to get a sense of the raw emotions on display, and on the contrary feelings each character has about his or her place in the sun. Nicely done Fritz and crew, nicely done.",1489276800,,4303,4.4961636828644505

There's not a lot of backstory given about Barbara Stanwyck's character, but her behavior seems to scream ""selfish ingrate"". The obnoxious friend of Paul Douglas's character gave an ominous tone to the film at first glance. I found myself hoping someone would give the uncle a beatdown for all his meddling and instigating - which proves the actor in that role was very good. I've recently become a Paul Douglas fan after seeing him in the films The Solid Gold Cadillac and A Letter To Three Wives - I'm drawn to the non-pretty boy types.
