The plot is pretty basic : Miho is given the ability to transform into a teenager by 2 stuffed dinosaurs and is scouted by an agency. The show shows Miho having to balance auditions and whatnot with her real life while hiding her identity.

There are a plenty of anime about child wanting to grow up and getting the magical ability to do so: Full Moon and Instant Teen for example. But I feel this version adds something worthwhile to the genre.

The protagonist Miho is charming. She is a 10 year old girl doing her best in an adult world. Miho feels like a child. A lot of anime don't understand how children act and feel this one has a strong understanding of how children think. I like Miho which is a great start to any anime series.

This anime is much more realistic than others of the genre. It show more of the mundane side of things with Lala having to go to auditions and shoots getting canceled and a small agency doing their best. The emotions are generally not portrayed as over the top. The reactions are more like real-life which is a nice change from a lot of the stuff I see today. The characters are developed through seeing their lives and it relies less on flashbacks to tell the story.

While this maynot be the very best of the magical girl genre it is pretty fun. You like the characters, it has an easy to follow story-line, and the animation is solid.",1446595200,,1502,4.315602836879433

This isn't always bad because shows like Sailor Moon and Pretty Sammy have other factors that make them good. Fancy Lala, however, goes in a totally different direction, and the show just makes me...feel good.

What sets Lala apart is that she's not saving the world, or even doing anything overly special. Miho is an ordinary girl, and not even a particularly flawed one. Her dream is to become an idol singer, like that of many Japanese girls, and is a very good artist. She recieves the power to change her form from a 9 year old into a 15 year old, along with being able to make real whatever she draws. However, she still has the mind of a 9 year old in that body, so the consequences of her actions are not always apparent to her. She has to deal with her double life as a 3rd grader and as a model, including often running off from her friends and sneaking around her house.

The show really starts getting good at the third episode -- I found that I really wanted to know what would happen. It's not really something I can explain, but it just sort of hooked me in

The technical aspects of the show are great too -- it's stunning visually, nice background music, catchy vocals, and a great Japanese cast. The dub is unfortunetly subpar, but it's still better than many. And at 5 episodes for $5 less than a normal anime DVD, this is certainly one of the better buys out there.",1041811200,7,1503,4.379928315412187
7963132,4,B000067IWD,"I received this series fansubbed a year ago and fell in love with it the first time I watched it. It is one of those series which you will either love or hate. I have taken to this incredibly cute shoujo series deeply and love it to pieces. No matter how many times I watch it, it never ceases to make me smile.

Fancy Lala is the tale of a young girl named Miho who encounters a pair of small, mystical, dinosaur-like beings, Mogu and Pigu, who are lost. Miho promises to help them find their way home and, to repay her, Mogu and Pigu give her a magic sketchbook and pen. With these, she is able to transform into her made-up fantasy dream idol, Fancy Lala. A new life for her begins as she finds herself living two lives: One, a third grader who loves to draw her own manga and another, the beautiful and talented model/singer, Lala.

I think that the character of Miho is incredibly well protrayed and likeable because she is so mature for her age and is able to act like an aspiring fifteen year old model. Also, the fact that she wants to be a manga artist when she grows up is a plus! That's so cool! I can't tell anymore without ruining the story for you, so buy this series when it comes out on DVD if you're the type that likes shoujo anime! And even if you're not, which I'm not generally, give it a try!

Also, I highly reccomend the subtitled version (I have no idea if Bandai dubbed this series) and don't know if a dubbed version will be as good.",1023062400,9,1460,4.1886120996441285
