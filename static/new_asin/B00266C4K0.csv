8352127,5,B00266C4K0,"An excellent selection from the different stages of the film making career of Jean-Luc Godard. The early films (mostly) have kept their freshness and originality. The later ones are 'difficult', densely packed but often present beautiful images. There are helpful commentaries from Colin McCabe with most of the films and excellent additional features including interviews and small films. These films can be enjoyed and studied as products of their time but aside from historical interest they are often very interestingly crafted.",1277337600,4,532,5.580246913580247
