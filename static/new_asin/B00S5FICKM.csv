8697371,5,B00S5FICKM,"Don't let the description get you ""lost in translation."" The movie was cute/ funny/ and I enjoyed it very much. Glad it had English subtitles to understand certain dialogue but no translator needed for a few good laughs.",1497916800,,220,4.815789473684211
8697372,5,B00S5FICKM,"Ignore the incompetent (and inaccurate) description (and the subsequent ill-informed critique of same), and just sit back and enjoy this laugh-out-loud Israeli farce. It's one of that country's best ever comedies, and was a big hit at both the domestic box office and at the U.S.-based Israel Film Festival, which is where I saw it a couple of years ago. A delight from start to finish!",1479600000,,386,4.863636363636363
