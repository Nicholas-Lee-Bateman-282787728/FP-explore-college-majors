8535002,2,097047007X,"I bought the video (set of 4) through Merv's web site, about 6 months ago. I was very excited to start upholster some of my old furniture pieces that needed to be repaired.  I couldn't wait to start.  Not after about 30 minutes of watching of the video tape, did I realize that I would not be able to do anything with my pieces unless I had a very close-up look at the work that was presented in the video.  The quality of the video is very poor (to say the least).  It seemed to me that there was no beginning or the end of each project.  A proper introduction to each project was missing, which mixed up the whole project work.  Moreover, there was always an annoying noise on the background which made it very difficult to distinguish some words of the comments.  At some point the first video cassette (Part ""A"") abruptly stopped with no comment whatsoever.  The second video (Part ""B"") began with no comment at all.  The picture is so blurry and unclear that there was no way to see the details of the very important parts of the projects.  There was no close-up look at details whatsoever.  All I could see was the Merv's back that simply blocked the view most of the time.  Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed with the overall quality of the training video and I strongly believe that such a video is simply unacceptable for training or for selling for that matter.  I don't think this training video will work for me.  I would also expect to get something much better for the money I spent on the video. ...  Very disappointing!",1036195200,10,1546,4.413427561837456
