8130162,3,B0007LI25C,"This is Volume 4 of the 10 volume Columbia House series of Woody Woodpecker videos. The video reproduces several episodes of Walter Lantz' TV show from 1976; half of them (from What's Sweepin' onward) are missing their original titles, and three of them are edited for time or content (The Reckless Driver, What's Sweepin' and Swing Your Partner). On the other hand, what you do see are in very good quality. Here are the contents of this volume: Fish Fry [an Andy Panda Cartune] (1944), Pixie Panic [a Musical Miniature Cartune] (1948), Woody Dines Out (1945), Crow Crazy [an Andy Panda Cartune] (1945), The Sliphorn King of Polaroo [a Swing Symphony Cartune] (1945), The Reckless Driver (1946), What's Sweepin' (1953), The Mouse and the Lion [a Foolish Fable Cartune] (1953), The Legend of Rockabye Point [a Chilly Willy Cartune directed by Tex Avery] (1955), Termites from Mars (1952), Swing Your Partner [a Swing Symphony Cartune] (1943) and Hold That Rock [a Chilly Willy Cartune] (1956).

Rounding out the volume are a newsreel narrated by Woody and a few segments with Lantz (these were made for the show).",1169251200,,1113,4.951871657754011
