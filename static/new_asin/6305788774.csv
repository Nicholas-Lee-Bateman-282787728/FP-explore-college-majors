7894846,4,6305788774,"This program, an installment of the unforgettable,but unjustly neglected ""Bell Telephone Hour"" series, was originally part of the special day's lineup for January 1, 1967---New Year's Day---and was probably meant  as a sort of interlude to top off the day's parade and football  activities. (""Bell Telephone Hour"" programs had been switched in 1965 from Tuesdays at 10:00 P.M. to Sundays at 6:30 P.M.)

""The Bell Telephone Hour"" programs began on  radio in the 1940's and came to television in 1959, where they were one of  the few programs on which to find classical and Broadway show music  attractively presented on commercial network television, something that NBC  and the other two major networks did not shy away from in those pre-PBS  days the way they do now.

This program is one of the first which dates  from the era in which color television programs had finally become the  norm. The format in this episode is quite simple. Conductor Donald  Voorhees,trying to sound relaxed and informal (and largely succeeding)  introduces the four operatic divas on this program. They each sing an  aria--in obviously studio-built (but not ridiculous-looking) settings,then  engage in some informal chat with Voorhees about their profession and their  preferences for music,then proceed to sing another aria. Voorhees and the  scriptwriters have clearly not aimed the conversation at a highbrow  audience (his first line,spoken directly at the studio audience,is  ""What is a prima donna?""),and while this might make some  snotty,ultra-sophsticated music experts squirm, the comments never really  become embarrassing the way the comments on some modern-day presentations  (i.e. ""Holiday at Pops"" on A & E) tend to do,due mostly to  the fact that Voorhees was a respected classical conductor himself and not  some ill-informed TV personality.

As for the music and the singing, that  is what makes this video invaluable. The arias are not adapted or cut for  mass consumption--just magnificently sung. The sound is not really  state-of-the art,and the color is staight out of 1960's videotape,but then,  where else could you see color footage of Joan Sutherland,Leontyne  Price,Renata Tebaldi,and Birgit Nilsson singing on the same program?",960854400,21,2239,5.38728323699422
