2615672,1,B000GNOFAW,Do not buy this DVD unless you speak/understand Italian or French. The DVD is falsely advertised as having English subtitles which it does not!!!!,1295222400,3,146,5.125
2615673,2,B000GNOFAW,"I must say that the item arrived brand new, all three disks were included, and when I opened one of them, all excited, I found out that the movie has ONLY FRENCH/ITALIAN subtitles.
I've spent hours online trying to find this movie so I could share it with my boyfriend who loved what he's seen for 4-5 minutes while we were STILL hoping that we would be able to set up ENGLISH subtitles. Once the disappointment set in, I wrote to the seller, STILL HOPING that he has made a mistake, and would tell me that he would send me the RIGHT version.
Well, he just told me that he will refund me my money if I ship it back.
What is unclear is who is going to pay for an international shipping, and I am certainly not willing to go to the post office right in the middle of the Christmas mailing.",1292976000,,787,4.150326797385621
2615674,3,B000GNOFAW,"For this review I'm not talking about the OBVIOUSLY outdated action and gadgets elements but just taking into account the story and characters.

Well the first Fantomas was great and I'd gadly give it 4 or 5 stars but the two others were REALLY lame and boring to a point that I had to fast-forward most of it. A big waste of time and horrible acting with the most ridiculous story I've ever seen, seemed like written by a 5 year old.

Just watch the first one and toss the other two in the garbage where they belong.",1199923200,3,517,4.26530612244898

2615676,5,B000GNOFAW,"An excellent trilogy !  The best adventure-comedy film of my childhood !

I feel fortunate I DO UNDERSTAND FRENCH, and enjoy all the good humor that no Englich subtitle would be able to convey.

However ... shame on French studios, such as Gaumont, Kanal, etc for not making available subtitles to some of their excellent films, ""Le Clan des Siciliens"" for instance ...  Same remark regarding the excellent recent musical show ""Le Roi Soleil"", ""Le Petiti Prince"", ""Notre Dame de Paris"".",1190073600,7,486,4.962962962962963
2615677,5,B000GNOFAW,"I SAW FANTOMAS (ALL THREE) OF THEM IN MY CHILDHOOD. I WAS OBSESSED WITH IT. IT IS A GREAT FANTASY MOVIE NOT UNLIKE THE SAINT WHICH CAN ADOPT ANY HUMAN FACE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE ONLY COPIES AVAILABLE ARE IN FRENCH.

 THERE ARE COPIES DUBBED IN SPANISH, BUT WHERE?",1178668800,5,266,4.3

2615681,5,B000GNOFAW,"I can confidently say that for me, this French film is the standard of the adventure genre. The plot of the film is fantastic. This film is about a mysterious and elusive criminal named Fantomas. It really is a brilliant mind, against which all are powerless, including the police. Jean Marais and Louis de Funs played brilliantly in this film. They brought to the film humor. Now half a century later, this film you can watch as much as you want!",1447027200,,447,4.530864197530864

2615687,3,B000GNOFAW,"This is rerderved to fans who appreciate french humour and particularly the spirited and funny man Louis de Funes.
I haven'ty seen any bad movie starring Him yet. This movie could fall under Inspector Clouseau mishaps and comical
situation. Give it  a go, you'll like it. If you speak French it will be a bonus!!",1395360000,,312,4.672727272727273
2615688,3,B000GNOFAW,I love the movie but really wish they had included either English or German subtitles so I could actually understand all the speaking parts so because of that I can only give it 3 stars. Hard to believe that this day and age a DVD only comes in one language which is really lame.,1353715200,4,279,4.185185185185185

8133676,5,B000GNOFAW,"French comic genius Louis De Funes steals the show.

His facial expressions, his walking style, his fluttering eyes and eye brows are all used for comic expressions in this 1960s trilogy movie series Fantomas, De Funes is funny as heck playing Inspector Juve in his endless chase of Fantomas, a criminal with multiple disguises. In his quest to catch the jewel thief, among other crimes, Inspector Juve teams up with newspaper columnist of Le Point du Jour, played by Jean Marais, and photographer played by Mylene Demongeot. Yet, this movie, or series of movies, is worth watching because of De Funes. This one, Fantomas, is one of three movies made in the mid-1960s. The second is Fantomas unleashed, the third Fantomas and Scotland Yard. All of them are hysterically funny, I saw all three, yet I'll write about the first one, simply called Fantomas. These movies are ideal for those understanding intermediate French, since the acting rules the ambition of these films, not as much as the speaking parts. Reason, of course, this movie, is centered on acting talent because of Louis De Funes. He's like the Charlie Chaplin of France. His movements are belly, side splittin funny Everything he does on screen seems to be for the sake of laughter.

De Funes was an international star. Fantomas was popular in Britain as well as Germany, and in Asia. This movie was so funny, I think the British created the Pink Panther, starring Peter Sellers as Inspect Closeau, and the Americans created the TV show Get Smart starring Don Adams, on Inspector Juve. Crime fighting made hilarious with gun shots, flashy cars, and money.

These movie were directed by the talented film director Andre Hunebelle, yet everyone, director and cast, have to play second fiddle to De Junes. He steals the show. Of course, he had brilliant writers, and a brilliant director, yet there is no way to teach the body and facial expressions he constantly uses in this movie. Just looking at him for a few seconds invokes laughter. He's a comic powerhouse.

This movie, and the two other Fantomas movie, has a 1960s feel. It's a bit pass, but the laughs make up for the 1960s feel. Just watching Louis De Funes perform is worth the price of the ticket. He's so in sync with his comic gifts, one ends up laughing hard from start to finish. Too bad, only three Fantomas movies, were made, The first one simply called Fantomas is as good as the last two.

This movie is simply a laugh riot.",1473724800,3,2458,4.747072599531616
8133677,5,B000GNOFAW,"What the h.... is going on with this title now? I purchased these three movies on Amazon video and was able to watch them many times. All of a sudden and quite misteriously, they are now 'not available' to watch anymore... Very anoying and frustrating after having pay for them three.... This is an absolute GEM, (all three movies!!) and everyone with good discerning taste in just ""go to the movies with family and love everything you see"" mood should love this.
Great acting, nice story based on a revived villain of the past, awesome french actors, truly excellent actors, Jean Marais, best comp temporary modern classic actor I know (if there is such classification), he has a class and charm of his own.
Louis de Funes comic genius, lovely Mylene Demongeot, model-turned movie star .
The type of experience I got from watching this movie, theater like quality in my own living room, is a very special moment to be sharing with anyone that is reading or cares about these movies..., it was truly like going back in time, and and really hope they will issue the other two movies with this quality. I needed to write to someone somewhere out there.. BIG thumbs UP to Gaumount PicturesI would give a ten star if I could. Tks",1473552000,,1225,4.623853211009174
