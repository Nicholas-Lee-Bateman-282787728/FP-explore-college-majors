3148583,3,B000640N7K,This is re-release on the same feature title. I'd like to know it it contains with closed-captioning if not then why re-release them at first place. *Keeping my fingers crossed* for the accessible subtitles.,1383955200,,207,5.117647058823529
3148584,3,B000640N7K,"This movie comes at me a few different ways: When the action is happening, its a really good movie. When 'characters' (and I use the term loosely) are speaking, they utter some of the stiffest, most painful dialogue ever committed to celluloid. The little segments with the echoing 'whisper' are the worst; what was the point of the voice effect? 1980 movies don't have high-quality sountracks anyway, and this only serves to make it barely intelligible at times. There's many characters and plot threads brought up and dropped almost at random, and the acting is mediocre at best.

The only time it shines is the well-done martial arts sequences (many done with a minimum of cutting), which almost make it worth suffering through. The ending fight in particular is very nice, almost balletic in spots. A shame they couldn't have hired a screenwriter without a tin ear and possessing a sense of pace and structure.",1334534400,,914,4.896774193548387

3148586,5,B000640N7K,"Next to An Eye for An Eye this is probably his best movie.

Chuck Norris goes to a ninja traning camp that is training terroists to be the dark assisins.  He ends up running into his long lost adopted brother, shikura, and fighting him to the death.

There are a ton of great fight scenes in this film, but the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  If you like martial arts and great action scenes you'll enjoy this film.

3148587,5,B000640N7K,"one of Chuck norris's best films has been given special edition treatment courtesy of Scorpion releasing
i am a big of Chuck's early films mainly Good guys wear black, A Force of one, Forced vengeance, An eye for an eye
one film i havn't seen yet was the Octagon,
i knew the only way to check the film out was to buy it
i wanted the blu-ray version cause i knew a HD transfer would look excellent for a very old film like this one
well apparently the blu-ray version of this classic film is out of print now, amazon.com are totally out of stock of the blu-ray
but the Scorpion DVD version is still available

being a DVD version i knew the picture quality would only be Digital remaster not a High Definition transfer
man was i amazed & surprised how Good the widescreen transfer looks on this DVD release
Scorpion releasing made a big effort to clean up the picture quality for sure
i must admit the new transfer does look excellent in 1:78:1 ratio
 an extremely Good Digital remaster, very nice sharp & clear picture i was very impressed
the blu-ray version probably has an even better transfer but the blu-ray is out of print tragically
plus scorpion also add a brand new 5.1 surround sound mix aswell, no more terrible mono sound

it does not stop there either
there's new special features aswell
a new retrospective featurette simple called Making the Octagon goes for 40mins
new interviews with only the crew from the film and the films former Distributor American cinema who released the movie back in 1980
Director Eric Karson, Producer Joel freeman, editor Dann Cahn, and other crew members from American cinema are interviewed aswell
very unfortunately none of the actors from the film are interviewed not even Chuck norris
i believe some of the Actresses who played alongside Chuck norris in the film
left the Acting business Decades ago so that's one of many reasons why some of them are not interviewed
only Actor/Martial arts teacher Richard norton who plays main Ninja assassin KYO is interviewed
Richard is dressed in full Ninja costume Head to Toe in the movie
this retrospect Doco covers the script, producing, production design, the Ninja costumes, the casting, the Editing
so it's very interesting 40mins
a new Audio commentary is recorded and done by Director Eric Karson
plus a new seperate interview with Japanese martial artist teacher Tadashi Yamashita -8mins long
plus Original theatrical trailer is included
there's also reversible cover artwork, new updated 2014 artwork or the 1980 poster artwork, your choice

so scrap the older dvd versions of the Octagon, get this new scorpions releasing dvd version or blu-ray version
both versions have the exact same special features content
if you can get the blu-ray version, it's out of print now very hard to get you'll be paying over $100 to get a copy
so your better off buying the DVD version if you just want to check out the film & check out the new extras
5 stars for the DVD release",1435622400,3,2962,4.723404255319149
3148588,5,B000640N7K,"Very good and enjoyable movie.  I had seen this way back when I was a kid and remembered it well.  Just recently watched it again and although the film moves like a video game and comes off as complete fantasy, I still never the less really enjoyed the Ninja-Martial Art themes and this one, along with ""Silent Rage"", ""Return of the Dragon"",and ""Delta Force"" I honestly consider to be one of Chuck Norris's absolute best action adventure movies.  I had seen all of those movies as a kid and this ""Ninja"" one sticks out as being the most entertaining.

Real life Japanese fighter and martial arts expert Tadashi Yamashita had played the role of the leading villain.

The plot itself is pretty ridiculous & has no baring on reality; Chuck Norris is a Martial Arts athlete & I assume former Ninja fighter who runs into this clan of Terrorist Ninjas who try to assassinate his girlfriend, and later a few other people where Chuck then springs into action.  The scene where he is with a woman in the house, that just happens to get attacked by Ninjas is fun, but sometimes almost laughable too.  Chuck Norris has a personal beef with the leader of this death clan and after he infiltrates their command base, he has to fight a series of warriors in a ""video game"" like fashion until he finally squares off against the big boss man himself Yamashita.

 In either case as a action adventure film I still think this is a good movie so I give it an A with two thumbs up.  Age range I would say maybe 12 & above.  This film sticks out because it has a fairly good presentation of Ninja Fighters vs other films like ""Power Rangers"" or ""Ninja Turtles"" which featured them in a fantasy kid setting.",1431820800,,1685,4.473856209150327
