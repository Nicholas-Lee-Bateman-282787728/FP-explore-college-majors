8441032,5,B004TWOX4Y,"Well, what can be said about perfection?
That is perfect. As bubbly as champagne and ten times better.  Two great singers let their hair down (figuratively): Dessay and Loft are superb in their respective roles.  Yann Beuron proves once and for all you can be eye-candy and have a magnificent French lyric tenor voice.  The respective casts are as strong as one can desire, sets are amazing as the dance sequences (and EVERYONE dances) are exhaustingly and athletically gorgeous. The team Minkowski/Laurent Pelly has two solid hits in its hands.  Worth every penny!!!!!",1456876800,,569,5.086021505376344
8441033,5,B004TWOX4Y,"Why did I choose this (5 Star) rating?: They're simply two of the funniest, liveliest, most outrageous opera performances I've ever seen.  Who says opera has to be dull?  This is a pair of fractured fairy tales set to glorious music.  Never mind 5 stars.  This deserves 10 stars at least.

So turn off the football game and turn on Offenbach.  I'd recommend this to everyone, especially those who claim they hate classical music.

Need more?  Did I mention scantily clad women, wild dancing, a drunken orgy, scandalous love affairs, and a trip to Hades?",1389225600,,553,4.747368421052632

8441035,5,B004TWOX4Y,"You want to have fun?
Get these performances---by all means!

Based on serious Greek Mythology, both fables as presented by Offenbach and his librettists satirize French society's facades and, indeed, humankind's so-called sensibilities in a very delightful manner.
Importantly, the casts are marvelous. Everyone genuinely seems to be having fun, as it should be. Special kudos to Natalie Dessay (The Eurydice of Orpheus) and Felicity Lott (Mrs. Helene).
Marc Minkowski, conductor, and his orchestra inject just the 'right' mount of elan.
Laurent Pelly, director, is imaginative, creative, witty and manifests greatly enjoyable performances.
Offenbach's tunes are infectious and memorable. Toe-tapping, energetic they even entice one to get up & do the Can-Can (in tu-tus no less should one be male).

Arthaus Musik presents both with quality visuals and sound (avoid the KULTUR offering) at a very reasonable boxed price.

Bzzz, Bzzz, Bzzz check them out, by Jupiter!!!
And don't forget to bring your suntan lotion too!",1356566400,6,1020,5.5256410256410255

Here's a sure (non-medical) cure!

Get these discs. Then head over to your friendly purveyor of adult beverages and grab a couple of bottles of Champagne. Might as well pick up a wedge of Brie and some pate while you're at it.

Now, while the bubbly is icing down, put La Belle Helene in the player and skip ahead to the ""documentary"" and watch the commentaries by Laurent Pelly on staging and by Marc Minkowsky on conducting Offenbach's music. You'll appreciate what they've done with these 19th century pieces if you do this first. Get the bubbly and munchies and get comfortable. If your case of the blahs is SO related, make sure you turn up the volume so he/she can hear you having a grand time! It drives 'em nuts!!

These operettas are hugely enjoyable! Of course they are satirical, and both come out of a truly whacky view of Greek mythology with a big touch of Gallic humor. La Belle Helene is staged such that the story is a figment of Felicity Lott""s dreams, after an unsuccessful attempt at ... errr ... ""horizontal refreshment"" with her husband who is sound asleep!

Orpheus is a bit more traditional in the staging and features Natalie Dessay as Eurydice. Need I say more?

In addition to Mesdames Lott and Dessay, both discs feature the talented Yann Beuron, who shows that French lyric tenors did not become extinct after Alaine Vanzo. The rest of both casts are, without exception, hugely talented, both musically and as actors. Pelly's skills as stage director are in evidence in almost every moment. (Without spoiling the surprise, pay close attention to the dance sequences!) I have never heard Offenbach conducted as well as by Marc Minkowsky; the pace is brisk, yet detailed.

Disc quality is impeccable. Video is crisp on both discs and the DTS sound has to be experienced to be appreciated. I used the remote to switch to stereo and back to 5.1 a couple of times, so the enhanced ""feel"" of the house is not imaginary.

Both of the individual discs are reviewed in detail on Amazon. I like the box set primarily for the price.

After enjoying these performances, I suspect that your adult beverage vendor may have an increase in sales. That's because there are Other Offenbach operettas on DVD. Like La Grande Duchesse de Gerolstein, La Vie Parieienne, Les Brigands ... and all are great theatrical experiences! But a glass or two of bubbly makes the performance SO much more enjoyable. It's so French, don't ya know ...",1312243200,12,2516,4.67420814479638
