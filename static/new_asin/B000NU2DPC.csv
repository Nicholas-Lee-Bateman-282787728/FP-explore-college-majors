8181388,3,B000NU2DPC,"There are a number of videos not on here such as ""Come Together"", ""Let It Be"", ""Hello Goodbye"" (alternate version), ""Free as a Bird"", ""Real Love"", ""All You Need is Love"" (black and white version), ""Rain"" (alternate version), ""Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band"", ""Blackbird"", ""Yesterday"" and ""A Day in the Life"".  There could have been 2 DVDs.  The band helped pave the way for videos along with directors Dickie Lester and Michael Lindsay-Hogg.  As one can expect, the sound and picture quality can be out of sorts at times.  Some are even at a slower pitch.  Hopefully Apple and Universal will release an official DVD and BluRay of all the clips.",1403136000,,649,4.758928571428571
8181389,4,B000NU2DPC,"Well, first of all I must say that this amount of classic Beatles on one DVD is unusual in every way. This was originally put out on the underground market back in the early 1980's on VHS video tape (I'm looking at mine right now!) with a different cover: ""The Beatles"" on top with a great photo of Ringo holding a cymbal surrounded by Paul holding his Hofner bass, John and George holding their Epiphone guitars - all three guitars upside down! Looks so cool. The video tape included a total of 42 instead of only 36 video clips on this compilation. It contained a combination of color and B/W versions and the audio is from a superb source, clean stereo where possible. Probably the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that there are many clips that were simply pulled right off of their 3 movies: A Hard Day's Night, Help!, and the animated Yellow Submarine. The early black and white clips from their 1963/1964 British TV shows are some of the most innocent and revealing. But there is no lacking of fascination that comes from watching the evolution from lip syncing those early songs all the way through the Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever period of psychedelia. Hey Jude and the Magical Mystery Tour film clips are nice, but the most moving of all is the live/lip sync overdub of Revolution in which John shreds on his doubled up lead vocal with Paul and George adding the live parts of ""Shoobey-Doo-Wah, Ooh-Shoobey-Doo-Wah"", a forshadowing of that line in the slower version of Revolution 1 on the White Album. Its a bit sad that each time EMI/Apple release something Beatles-related, it appears to be painful for them. Therefore, the bootlegs and pirated versions have just a little more sweetness to them. And this is one of those sweet things!",1358035200,2,1757,4.670967741935484
