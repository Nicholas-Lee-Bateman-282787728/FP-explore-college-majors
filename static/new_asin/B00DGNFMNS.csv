5798165,5,B00DGNFMNS,"I love watching the A-Team with my dad. It is a fun show with TONZ of action scenes and a great running gag that, no matter how bad a car accident is on THIS show, everyone always crawls out alive! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1415577600,2,217,4.190476190476191
5798166,4,B00DGNFMNS,"The shows are good and great but as for the sound not that impressive, I have to turn the volume up to hear and turn it down when it gets loud in certain scenes .",1403049600,,162,3.657142857142857
5798167,3,B00DGNFMNS,"Great series and after several tries, I finally got a good playable set.  But it still is cheaply done.  This is the final season Amy is part of the series.  it was rumored that George Peppard did not want Amy in the action like the actress who played Amy wanted.  So they fired her.  They hired another reporter, who was more cooperative than the woman who played Amy, but the fans were upset over the loss of Amy, so she too got canned, and it was from then on, just the four of them for hire.",1392768000,,495,4.114583333333333
5798168,5,B00DGNFMNS,"Got it for my favorite NFL Strategy partner who needs all the help he can get for his fantasy football team.

(Everyone he drafts ends up on injured reserve, so, since Celluloid Heroes never feel any pain...)",1366416000,,208,4.621621621621622
5798169,4,B00DGNFMNS,"This 1983-84 Season of THE A-TEAM was the last good season throughout its entire 4-year run on NBC, especially since their colleague reporter Amy Allen(Melinda Culea)was abruptly dropped from the show in mid season in the mid Fall of 1983, since Culea was fired for being too tomboyish, resulting in the A-TEAM going from a fivesome to a foursome all of the sudden with no explanation on why Amy departed after only the 9th week of this 1983-1984 Season, back in late November of 1983, which was similar to how CBS had abruptly cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the middle of its 5th and final season back in the Fall of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS after CBS had announced back in the Summer of 1981 that the Hulk was on the chopping block.

Additionally, this was also the season when Lance LeGault joins the cast as the callous Army nemesis(Col. Decker)replacing his overzealous predecessor, Col. Lynch(Bill Lucking).

A-TEAM's 2nd Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it every Tuesday night at 8PM on NBC before RIPTIDE at 9PM topped off by REMINGTON STEELE at 10PM, back to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade and when NBC's motto was ""BE THERE"".

This 1983-84 Season also had a lot of interesting guest stars like
*Morgan Woodward from DALLAS appearing in the ""When You Coming Back Range Rider"" episode, which is the episode when Decker makes his first appearance.
*Andy Robinson from STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE SIX coming out in ""The White Ballot"" episode
*Markie Post from THE FALL GUY and NIGHT COURT appearing in ""The Only Church In Town"" episode
*Bill Boyett, which played Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12 appearing in the ""Steel"" episode
*John Amos after his co-starring days on GOOD TIMES and before his co=starring days as the ornery Capt. Dolan on HUNTER, appearing in the ""Pure Dee Poison"" episode
*Tim Donnelly whom played Fireman Chet Kelley on EMERGENCY appearing in the ""Say It With Bullets"" episode
*Dennis Franz whom played Det. Norman Buntz on HILL STREET BLUES and the ornery Det. Andy Sipowitz on NYPD BLUE, appearing in the ""Chopping Spree"" episode
*Tim O'Connor whom played Dr. Huer on BUCK ROGERS appearing in the ""Semi-Friendly Persuasion"" episode

I also used to watch A-TEAM in reruns on FX from the Fall of 1996 thru the Summer of 1998, and then on TV Land from the Winter of 2000 till the Winter of 2002, and then on TNN, which is now Spike, from the Winter of 2002 till the late Fall of 2003, and then on TV Land again from the Winter of 2006 till around the Spring of 2007 when TV Land bought the rights to the show again around January of 2006, and now A-TEAM will be coming to Cozi-TV in January of 2016, but now I'm curious to see if THE A-TEAM will eventually end up coming to MeTV or Cozi-TV next, especially since those subchannelled networks have a lot of Universal distributed shows, including MAGNUM, P.I., KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, ROCKFORD FILES, DRAGNET, ADAM-12, EMERGENCY, etc.",1258675200,2,2976,4.641366223908919
