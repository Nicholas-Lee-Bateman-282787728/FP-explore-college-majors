472096,5,6302484383,"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) is one of my all time favorite movies! I must admit that I am not the biggest musical movie fan, but being a die-hard fan of Marilyn Monroe, I knew I had to give this one a shot. And, to put it bluntly, I am so glad that I did! Of course, Marilyn isn't the only main attraction here; there's also the ravishing Jane Russell (who gets top billing). Together, these two lovely ladies light up the screen with music, romance, and their spot-on comedic timing.

Showgirls Lorelei Lee (Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Russell) are best friends, but they're polar opposites. Lorelei likes money, wealthy men, and most especially beautiful jewelry; however, Dorothy is a romantic, she likes all men, not matter how much money they have. Lorelei is engaged to Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan), a millionaire she calls ""Daddy"". Gus' father (Taylor Holmes), however, is against their marriage, believing Lorelei to be no more than a gold-digger. While on a boat to France, where Lorelei and Gus are to be married, the two women encountered quite a few people: there's Sir Francis ""Piggy"" Beekman (Charles Coburn), a diamond mine owner, Henry Spofford III (George Winslow), a very young millionaire, and Ernie Malone (Elliott Reid), a man hired to spy on Lorelei, but who falls in love with Dorothy. That's all the plot I'm going to give you for two reasons: 1) If you've seen the movie, you know what happens, and 2) If you haven't seen the movie, I'm certainly not going to ruin it for you!

Anyways, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a overly entertaining delight from start to finish. Monroe and Russell have excellent chemistry, and both women have great talent; they can sing, dance, and have dynamite comedy skills. Particular highlights are Russell's rendition of ""Ain't There Anyone Here for Love?"" and Monroe's famous (and often parodied) version of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"". There are other songs, of course, because this is a musical, and there are quite of few funny moments, although some can be quite corny.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is definitely worth a look-see. I understand it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is very enjoyable and classic entertainment. It's one of Hollywood's last great ""Golden Age"" musicals, and it has two of the era's sexiest and most-popular stars: Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell! If you're a fan of either actress, I'm sure this movie won't disappoint; and if you're a fan of both like I am, it's an even greater plus! Highly Recommended.",1466035200,,2505,4.848130841121495

Along with others, Madonna drew inspiration from it, down to Marylyns pink gown, the red set, and the chorus boys for her Material Girl video.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gentlemen-Prefer-Blondes-Blu-ray/dp/B007ZFR4I4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes [Blu-ray</a>] is pure cinematic confection, very bright, very colorful, in a way television, the revolutionary media competitor of the time, wouldnt match for a decade, and not truly match until the advent of high definition broadcasting. Its a typical gold-digger story line, with Marylyn as Lorelei Lee, who seeks rich men and pretty much sums up her philosophy in Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend, and in her cagey pitch to father of her intended Esmond, Sr.

Interesting features include the handling of sex in some sparkling repartee that leaves the nitty-gritty details unsaid but also unmistakeable, the colorful though brief travelogue footage of Paris in the early 1950s, and the treatment of color. Those who enjoy watching color films from the various decades notice how reds, greens, golds, and the rest of the color wheel, differ depending on the time period. For instance, early 1950s red is a tone you don't see these days, as is true with many other shades in films like this.

If youve never seen the movie, treat yourself. If you have, maybe its time to take another look.",1453766400,,1643,5.460629921259843

472144,4,6302484383,"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is an adaptation of the 1949 stage musical that stars Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, with Charles Coburn, Elliott Reid, Tommy Noonan, Taylor Holmes, and Norma Varden in supporting roles.

Miss Lorelei Lee has a philosophy that ""Diamonds are a girl's best friend."" Together with her best human friend Dorothy, she embarks upon a boat trip to Paris, where she intends to marry millionaire Gus Esmond. En route, the girls are bedeviled by private detective Malone, hired by Esmond's father to make certain that Lorelei isn't just another gold- digger. When Dorothy falls in love with the poverty-stricken Malone, Lorelei decides to find her pal a wealthier potential husband, and that's how she gets mixed up with flirtatious diamond merchant Sir Francis Beekman and precocious youngster Henry Spofford III.

Howard Hawks' joyous musical comedy of 1953 is the film that catapulted Marilyn Monroe to major stardom and iconic status as sex symbol. Also,both leads - Jane Russell and Monroe - has sparkling magnetism that makes it a delightfully entertaining 1950's musical that can still be enjoyed at present. It is charged by Hawks's stylish snap, a famous set piece or two, Russell's wit, and songs by Leo Robin and Jule Styne. It may largely be a fluff project best remembered as a showcase for its leading actresses, but then the leads rarely got such extended opportunities to prove that they were more than cinematic icons but just sex symbols. Overall,it's a wild and joyously funny ride across the Atlantic as our bathing beauties plan and plot a way to land their men.",1451088000,,1600,5.033962264150944

This film is a perfect example; here, Monroe is not only mesmerizing, with the viewer unable to look away from her whenever she is on-screen, but she also does a brilliant job as Lorelei Lee, a singer who values her rich fiancee Gus as much for his money as his love of her, while her best friend and fellow vocalist Dorothy (Russell) tries to keep her out of trouble.  The two board an ocean liner to Paris, on Gus' dime, where Lorelei obsession for diamonds gets her into trouble and a private detective hired by Gus' disapproving father stirs the pot even more.  Add a funny, semi-lecherous aristocrat named Piggy and an all-male Olympic team of athletes to the mix, and the girls wind up in Paris without a dime and the cops after Lorelei.  A great film, and good GOD is Monroe wholly bewitching in it.",1423267200,,1073,4.404040404040404
472294,5,6302484383,"Coming off the huge success of NIAGARA, this would be Marilyn's second movie in 1953. It turned out to be another huge box office smash for her, Jane, and Fox. What it did was basically solidify Marilyn Monroe as a box office draw and megastar. Jane, an already established star in her own right, plays the part of Dorothy while Marilyn is Lorelei Lee. This movie was fun to watch and seeing these two ladies, of which I am a fan, in the same movie together was lovely. They had good screen chemistry and the song/dance numbers were just wonderful. For me, this is my favorite MM movie and I have all of them.
The Two ladies embark on a cruise to France and find out that the U.S. Olympic Team is also aboard. Lorelei's Fiancee' is worried on how she will act in his absence. A private investigator is sent by his father to watch Lorelei. The ladies get into some trouble over a Diamond Tiara and comedic hijinks ensue. It all works out for the best and the two women find that love conquers all in the end. The highlight of mine in the movie is Marilyn's ""Diamond's are a Girl's Best Friend"" number and the opening number with Jane Russell. Beautiful. I highly recommend this one if you love Marilyn!

472296,5,6302484383,"At first I was outraged when 4:3 format showed up on my widescreen, like others, went back and read the details, and it just said ""Full screen 1.37:1"", which is virtually 4:3 (1.33:1). I then went to IMDB to look at the technical details of how the film was originally shot, and low and behold, it was originally filmed in standard Academy format, 1.37:1. I guess the studio didn't think the movie, Marilyn, or screen play was worth investing in for the wider formats. I just ""assumed"" being a big musical with elaborate sets, it was filmed in VistaVision. With this disappointment being said, the technicolor transfer is beautiful and they did a pretty good job converting the mono Western Electric soundtrack to DTS 5.1. In audio setup, they actually give you the choice between the original mono or 5.1. Naturally, I chose the 5.1 and set my Yamaha HT amp to ""Spectacle"" which is made for epic films and musicals, and even on this setting, the singing in the music numbers was still a little too center channel for my tastes, but they did make use of the mains L&R for the orchestra. Only occasionally did they utilize the rear surrounds for sound effects, but considering many of these restored films do not have their mono soundtracks remastered for 5.1, I'll take it!",1421625600,,1273,4.6875

Marlyn shows here why she was a star and her signing and dancing is at top form.  A sad life burned up by a system that has not gone just morphed to destroy talent in new ways but the skills of Colburn and Russell carry through. The shipboard travel was even dated when this was made but the original book depicted a much earlier world.  This is still a good time for classic movies buffs.

472607,5,6302484383,"Although I am fan of classic films, I am usually disinterested in musicals, not matter whose in them, whether it be Judy Garland, Betty Grable, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire. Being a die-hard Marilyn Monroe fan, I thought I'd give this musical a chance. I was not expecting much, to be honest, but as it turned it, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) is undoubtedly one of the best musicals of its time and one of Monroe's best performances. Marilyn shines as the ""blonde"" (of course) and Jane Russell also stars as her brassy brunette companion.

Monroe and Russell head off this glittering, lavishly produced musical from 20th Century-Fox. It follows a simple, but delightful plot: Lorelei Lee (Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Russell) are beautiful and immensely talented showgirls. Lorelei has a rich fiancee, Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan), whose father (Taylor Holmes) does not want him to marry her, believing she is a gold-digger. On their way to Paris by ship, Lorelei meets a rich diamond mine owner, Sir Francis Beekman (Charles Coburn), but you can call him ""Piggy"", and Dorothy falls for Ernie Malone (Elliott Reid), who is secretly hired to spy on Lorelei. Meanwhile, Lorelei tries to set Dorothy up with a wealthy man, one of the candidates being the very rich, but also very young, Henry Spofford, III (George Winslow). Dorothy busts Ernie for spying on Lorelei, but Lorelei has far more troubles of her own: she has convinced Piggy to give her his wife's (Norma Varden) prized tiara and is in the midst of trying to convince the police that she did not steal it. Later, Dorothy poses as Lorelei in court and Lorelei tries to lure a weary Gus into giving her the money to payoff the tiara debt. He initially refuses, but is lured back in and is shocked when his father approves of their wedding. The end is a glittering wedding to tip off the perfect film.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is often overlooked as being a masterpiece, but I disagree. It may not be as well-produced, but it is one of the best musicals I have ever seen. It has lavish production numbers, laughable dialogue, pretty clothes, two beautiful ladies at the head, bright Technicolor, the list goes on. Most of the musicals recognized as ""classics"" are MGM's gems, and while these were great films in their own right, Fox had a succession of great musicals under its belt as well. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes will definitely not disappoint the viewer. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell turn out beautiful and long-lasting performances in roles that seem tailor-made for them. It is without a doubt one of the best films in my collection. It is worthy of viewing multiple times over. It never, absolutely never, gets old. Long may it live!",1398470400,,2696,4.8207343412527

472673,5,6302484383,"In some ways, some movies from the 1950s are more progressive than modern ones.

Not only does ""Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"" pass the Bechdel test in some ways, but it has a really brilliant choreographed musical number where a fully clothed Jane Russell is being backed up by a chorus line of almost-naked boyz.

Lorelei and Dorothy are both really practical in their different ways. The plot is pretty much a farce (which I love). The musical numbers are a lot of fun- and ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best friend"" is iconic, both as a sentiment and as a visual.

And, oh! the gorgeous CLOTHES!

Now- one thing I do wonder- did DeBeers pay for product placement here? because they were doing a serious push to make diamonds be seen as intrinsically valuable starting in the 1940s, and this was filmed in 1953. For the record- diamonds are NOT especially valuable; if you want to invest in material goods, gold- and physical gold, not certificates- would be the way to go.",1395964800,,963,4.647058823529412

I must admit that what drew me to want to watch this movie was the movie musical Burlesque. In this movie was a scene where they pay tribute to the song, ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend.""
I was curious to know where the original came from. I had no idea that the song came from ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."" I didn't even know that Marilyn Monroe was the one who sang it.

Maybe if they had worked George Winslow in a few more times, it would have been more entertaining.  It almost felt like Jane Russell was carrying the burden of making a show by herself, and Marilyn Monroe was just there for the money and face-time (or whatever you call it).  I'm glad I paid less than $5 for it, and I'm looking to dump it ASAP.  There are much better movies with the same people to be had.

472810,5,6302484383,"When you're feeling down in the dumps, a movie like GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES (20th Century Fox, 1953) is a sure cure, especially when it's got two cheery gals like Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell in it to make you forget your troubles. They play a couple of showgirls on an ocean liner bound for Paris - Marilyn's trying to land a millionaire and Jane is her less material-minded pal. Merriment and mix-ups ensue before they end up at the altar with their respective Prince Charmings.

Based on the Broadway hit by Anita Loos and directed by Howard Hawks, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is a veritable showcase for its two leading stars, and is simply one of the most entertaining musical comedies of all time. Both ladies look absolutely stunning in those lush, '50's era Technicolor tones which are fully captured in Fox's fabulous Blu-ray edition. Marilyn's most iconic number, ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"", is a showstopper to be sure, and here it sparkles with a clarity that'll knock your socks off. The crystal clear audio is in 5.1 stereo and original mono and alternate Spanish and French languages, with subtitles in English, Spanish and French. The movie is formatted to its original 1.37:1 aspect ratio. Extras include a Fox Movietone News: ""Marilyn and Jane in Cement"", the original trailer, and other Marilyn coming attractions.

GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is one of those movies that just seems to hit the spot at each viewing. It's sheer fun, and it captures that happy, carefree spirit of the '50's in a way few films do.

Highly recommended.",1378512000,5,1558,4.893939393939394

Dorothy is a down-to-earth, no nonsense woman, while Lorelei is an adorable, yet slightly dim blonde, whose lust for diamonds is just as powerful as her childlike innocence. The only thing that these two women have in common is their ability to turn the head of any man they cross paths with. In this heartwarming, classic comedy, two showgirls are sent on a luxury cruise ship to France. On the way, love is put to the test, and both women are dead set in finding the man they are destined to be with. Jane Russell is a genius as the brunette brain of the pair, and Monroe captures the viewers heart with her childlike beauty and innocence. This film is one if the first (along with Niagara) to propel Monroe into the eternal sex symbol status. If you are in the mood for a heartwarming, comedic love story, this is the film for you.

And here she's teamed up with an over-anxious and sadly old-beyond-her-years Jane Russell.

This is just bad.

So many gay men LOVE this movie but I find it, as a movie lover, deplorable and WRONG.  The songs are atrocious and MM, and JR, are made out not only as gold-diggers, which I could take if the script were halfway decent, but they are portrayed as STUPID gold-diggers.  And that's unforgivable.  And in the early 1950's it's more than stupid.  It's assinine.

A beautiful Marilyn Monroe and an over the hill Jane Russell (after the atrocious ""The Outlaw"" she was, really, begging for work at this point), appear foolish and useless.

473010,5,6302484383,"That thought slapped me across the face after I saw the film.  After all, Howard Hawks directed ""His Girl Friday"" with a Rosalind Russell that could stand up to any man...and dress in a better business suit!

There is that wonderful scene with Marilyn Monroe strutting like a model in an orange evening gown where she is more female than Cleopatra.  But isn't she subversively ""the man"" in the relationship with her intended beau? Compare this movie to so many other Hollywood films during the 1930's and 1940's. It's quite true that in those films women might be running a corporation or making scientific discoveries or flying airplanes, but at the conclusion of the movie they are supposed to gush and say what they really miss is ""being in love"" with a man. George Cukor's 1939 movie ""The Women"" is an example of this genre.

Not so with Marilyn Monroe's Lorelei..  She accepts the fact (as in her immortal song) that ""as girls grow old, men grow cold.""  And she intends to protect herself from any such event.  She is going to be Delilah to any man that crosses her path.  In fact, the man she intends to marry is effeminate and an easy push-over.  He is certainly not handsome.  But...he is very rich.  Marilyn is attracted to him - as she honestly admits - for his father's money - but she also likes being in control, the one who wears the pants.  She enjoys the fact that he doesn't object when she wants something.  And, importantly, it is obvious that she is the one who takes absolute charge in sexual matters.  When he says he wants to back off, she pulls him into her room; after some minutes pass he does not have a chance.

Contrary to some of her other roles, let's say ""Some Like it Hot"", she is actually very bright.  When the headwaiter of the  cruise ship is paid by men to sit at ""her"" table, she insists that the waiter better shape up and make sure her choices are  honored. Shrewdly, she points out certain facts that force the headwaiter to do as she bids...making arguments as tight as a tough corporate lawyer would.  And when she just about seduces a rich husband to turn over his wife's diamond tiara over to her...she refuses to give it up, even if it means arrest or jail.  In other words, she feels she earned it and takes a strong stance over her personal property.

On the surface, Jane Russell seems the brighter female.  Don't count on it.",1361836800,,2376,4.476744186046512

The sound works just fine for a movie of its age; it does appear that some separation was done with some of the sound effects (noticed during the ringing of the bell for ""Bye Bye Baby"" where it came from a rear speaker, but nothing that is going to blow you away. Just clear sound that highlights the vocals of Marilyn and Jane Russell perfectly. The one drawback are the extras; very few to speak of. A few Marilyn trailers (which promote other Fox Blu-ray releases) and a short Fox Movietone Newsreel showing Marilyn & Jane Russell putting their handprints in the cement at Grauman's Chinese Theater. No restoration comparison, no interviews, no deleted scenes, and no commentary. Pretty disappointing when considering what an icon Marilyn is, even today. The one other oddity is that on the back of the case, the photo of ""Marilyn"" from ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" doesn't even look like Marilyn; either it's another model or she is so heavily photoshopped that it just doesn't look like her. A minor quibble. At least Fox seemed to put their best foot forward on the quality of the picture and sound, which truly is the bottom line for this release. If you're not familiar with the story, here it is in a nutshell. Jane Russell (playing Dorothy) & Marilyn (as Lorelei) are two showgirls looking for love. Dorothy is single, and Lorelei is tied to a nerdy man (played perfectly by Tommy Noonan) worth millions. Unfortunately, her boyfriend's dad doesn't approve of the relationship. In order to make his heart grow fonder, Lorelei separates herself from her honey by taking a cruise with Dorothy. Unbeknownst to the girls, the dad has the two followed by a detective. Dorothy falls for the detective which throws a wrench into the whole proceedings.

A number of memorable musical numbers by Russell (""Anyone Here For Love?"") and Monroe (""Diamonds""). These two make a great combo, as you can really feel a genuine friendship with their on-screen chemistry. Highly recommended as one of Marilyn's most entertaining movies!",1344297600,17,2363,4.9075

They both work so well together in this film and they compliment each other perfectly! As two cabaret singers sailing abroad, they run into all kinds of complications involving men and diamonds. In between, we have some fun musical numbers that show off the singing and dancing talents of both of the stars.
A brief summary of the plot has Dorothy looking for love, and Loreli looking for men with rocks, (diamonds), while on a voyage to Europe. One of Marilyn's lines, ""A kiss on the hand is all very nice but a diamond tiara lasts longer"" still cracks me up! Of course, this film includes the iconic, ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" musical number which has been copied but NEVER done better than when Marilyn performs it!
Jane Russell also has some gems of her own, the most amusing being her imitation of Loreli towards the end of the film.
Charles Colburn is also around for the fun, as a randy, married millionaire who's infatuated with Loreli.

She is completely upstaged by a much deeper and well rounded Russell, who makes so much out of a film that is about as dense as it comes.  I'm not a big fan of `Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', but I am never apposed to watching it thanks to Jane Russell, that's how good she is here.  The plot is predictable and clichd, and the script doesn't really add any depth to the proceedings, but in the end it is enjoyable fluff and it does hit the comedic marks rather well.  I just wish that this film had more substance, especially when you consider the goldmine of comedic masterpieces that came out in the 50's.

Did the audience know that they were seeing that ""something"" that will only come along once?  By now, everyone knows that the Marilyn Monroe on that screen 57 years ago, was not that girl at all.  We all know that she was Norma Jean Baker, a very troubled, but very smart, sensitive, talented woman.  She was a huge movie star as Marilyn Monroe, but died alone at 36 in a small, house in Brentwood CA.  In the film Gentleman Prefer Blondes,  you will not see much of the true woman or developing actress.  Bus Stop, The Misfits, The Prince and the Showgirl, all show her growth and depth as an artist.  But, Gentleman Prefer Blondes is the best showcase for that wonderful creation Marilyn Monroe.  She just glows in this film.  Each scene captures the innocence, exaggerated sexiness and child-woman persona that has been much-copied, but never equaled.  ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" is classic Marilyn, and a truly delightful highlight of this enjoyable movie.  It is often shown in highlight reels among Hollywood's greatest all-time musical moments on film.

Jane sparkles as the smart, witty best friend to Lorelei -- the diamond loving, dumb blonde.  Jane's sparkling repartee as well as her performance capabilities (and my dad says her beauty) make her the most fun to watch.  She is what is known in theater circles as a triple threat; she can act, sing, and dance.  Oh, don't get me wrong; Marilyn does a very good job at what she does, and her attitude and performance are fun to watch.  I love how her character, Lorelei, is always trying to find Jane's character, Dorothy, a wealthier and more ""suitable escort"" despite the fact that Dorothy has told her she doesn't care about money.

Jane seems to be the older sister/parent to Marilyns' naive child. Its a shame they were not paired again. Their onscreen chemistry makes them a fine pair to behold.

May be quite continental,

But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

A kiss may be grand

But it won't pay the rental

On your humble flat

Or help you at the automat.

Men grow cold

As girls grow old,

And we all lose our charms in the end.

But square-cut or pear-shaped,

These rocks don't loose their shape.

Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

Tiffany's!

Cartier!

Black Starr!

Frost Gorham!

Talk to me Harry Winston.

Tell me all about it!

When a lass needs a lawyer,

But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

When a hard-boiled employer

Thinks you're awful nice,

But get that ice or else no dice.

He's your guy

When stocks are high,

But beware when they start to descend.

It's then that those louses

Go back to their spouses.

Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes gave Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell the perfect opportunity to showcase their numerous talents. They sing beautiful numbers including ""(We're Just) Two Little Girls From Little Rock;"" ""Bye Bye Baby;"" ""Ain't There Anyone Here For Love"" and ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend."" When Marilyn and Jane dance to some of these numbers their beauty and talent strike the viewer as incredible. Tommy Noonan turns in a strong and convincing performance as Gus Esmond, the American man who wants to marry Lorelei, who is played by Marilyn Monroe. Charles Coburn and Norma Varden perform as Sir Francis 'Piggy' Beekman and Lady Beekman, super rich people who got their wealth from diamond mining in South Africa. The crisp, clear color reflects the hard work to restore this movie and the sound is excellent, too! Jule Styne and Leo Robin provide wonderful music and lyrics for the classic songs in this picture.

The film starts as Lorelei and her girlfriend Dorothy Shaw embark on a ship for France. Although Dorothy plans to chaperone Lorelei, Lorelei has different plans and soon Dorothy's quest for a man distracts her from overseeing Lorelei anyway. The ship carries a male Olympic relay team and they certainly attract Dorothy's attention. A cast of characters are also on board, the most notable of which are Sir Beekman, who longs for an affair with a younger woman. His wife, Lady Beekman, travels with him. These characters all together on the same ship prove to be the ultimate formula for high jinks on both the high seas and overseas! Lorelei and Dorothy proceed to sink their claws into rich men for their money. However, unbeknownst to Lorelei, her fianc's father, Mr. Esmond, Sr., employs a detective onboard. The detective, Ernie Malone, must follow Lorelei and find evidence that she will be unfaithful to her fianc Gus Esmond. Mr. Esmond, Sr. can then destroy all plans for the wedding of Lorelei and Gus. Gus's father believes that such a marriage would be unsuitable for his son.

The scenes in Paris offer stunning backdrops and a wonderful idea of what Paris looked like in the early 1950s. After a few ups and downs Lorelei and Dorothy unexpectedly appear to be in a lot of financial trouble and they get jobs in a show to make money. Lorelei performs the unforgettable song and dance number ""Diamond's Are A Girl's Best Friend"" with male back up dancers. However, things become even more complicated when Lorelei stands accused of stealing a tiara that belonged to Lady Beekman. Actually, Sir Beekman gave the tiara to Lorelei in a weak moment because he found her to be beautiful--too bad he never told Lady Beekman! Lorelei and Dorothy sing the beautiful number ""When Love Goes Wrong (Nothing Goes Right)."" The cops begin to nip at their heels and Lorelei--or someone quite like her--appears in court because Lady Beekman wants her tiara returned to her. The ensuing court scene boasts a comedic, campy quality to it. Awesome!

Do things work themselves out at the end of this picture? Well, folks, there are no spoilers here--watch this movie and see for yourselves!

Marilyn Monroe fans will thrill to this great picture and Jane Russell fans will enjoy it just as much. People who enjoy musical comedies will also like this picture.",1170720000,41,4123,4.7740112994350286

Monroe was a wonder in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."" She comes into the film looking like a winner, and leaves as one... The picture has been set by the tone of her personality, set just so fully, let us say, as Ingmar Bergman leaves his mood on every scene...

Her personality infuses every corner of the film as if she has even picked the scenery to work for her... So the movie rises above its pretext, its story, its existence as a musical, even its music, and becomes at its best a magic work, yet it is a comic bubble without weight or solemnity, another piece of spun sugar come up out of everything banal in entertainment...

But Marilyn remains a great comedian, a sexual delight, especially when she sang ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend."" The film crowned Monroe in her position as the nation's new 'Love Goddess' with the promise of many sparkling hits to come, and Jane Russell's career continued, with less fanfare, but very successfully for several more years...",1167436800,6,1176,4.671497584541063

While I must confess that for Monroe this probably was her starmaking role, Russell really shines in the role of Dorothy, who inevitably must play Ethel to Marilyn Monroe's Lucy.

The tone is set for this movie by the opening number which involves Russell and Monroe singing about ""The Man from Little Rock.""  I am not sure how much effort was put into shooting this particular number, but Russell and Monroe are so striking that even the dead probably would take notice and burst into applause.

This movie is famous for the ""Diamonds are a girl's best Friend"" number that Monroe did and Madonna copied in her ""Material Girl"" video.  However, for my money, Russell certainly shows her considerable star quality when she parodies this number in the subsequent court room scene. No wonder Russell impressed Howard Hughes in her heyday. Hopefully she will be the subject of one of the box set tribute collections.

In short, this movie is a pure delight and well worth repeated watchings.  It is worth the price of admission to see two great stars at the height of their powers.",1157846400,3,1243,4.748837209302326
473420,5,6302484383,"Arguably, along with the 'Seven Year Itch', this lighthearted 50's musical comedy is the most definitive 'Marilyn' film. In particular for her memorable 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' number, so adorable in its (and her)innocent mocking self parody and brought to life again several decades later in Madonna's, 80's' Material Girl' Video.

This pairing of 'Monroe' and 'Russell' as two voluptuous show girls from 'Little Rock'"" in search of fun and a man or two on their way to Paris aboard a cruise ship, is pure Hollywood sugar coated entertainment and escapism.

Marilyne is just so funny and cute as the wide eyed, but gold digging, 'Lorelei', the supposed 'Dumb Blonde' who knows what she wants however, and why. In suitable contrast Jane Russell plays 'Dorothy' the more serious, switched on and streetwise Brunette. Who on the other hand, lets her heart(rather than her bank acccount)rule her head when it comes to men and plays a kind of big sister role to her more naive, but materialistic focused compatriot.

Though it may be said that for the most part 'Russell' is somewhat eclipsed by the 'platinum' ultra luminous presence of the 'eternal woman-child' Ms Monroe. She undoubtedly brings a lot of energy to the role, and the camaraderie and chemistry they deliver as a pair contribute much to the films charm and success.

There are several very entertaining 'showgirl' type musical numbers throughout. But I confess I enjoy Marilyn's ditzy remarks, balanced by a her cunningly disguised 'knowingness' the most. Sooo cute when she refers to the ship's portals as 'round windows' and innocently tries on a diamond tiara around her neck. Then, at the end justifies and explains her money driven ways to her finance's contemtuous Father,in the most surprisingly clever way. Pure 'Marilyn' in all her pure, unique celluloid magic!",1135728000,21,1843,5.072607260726072

let's you down. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell make a perfect

combination. The scene where they take off the pants of Malone

is hilarious. What I really enjoyed most is Marilyn reciting her

poem, which goes like this:

  I once knew a man called Sidney,

  Who drank 'til he ruined a kidney,

  he drank and he drank,

  and it shrank and it shrank,

  he had his fun doing it,

  now didnt't he?

The Diamonds are a girl's best friend number with Marilyn is pure

glamour. One can not stop looking at her. Her beauty is unique.

I hope that one day they will release a soundtrack CD of this

movie with all the music, including the instrumental music. And

please include Marilyn's poem ""I once knew a man called Sidney..""

Her singing is most enjoyable. And to Jayne Russell, to quote

from the movie, "" Dorothy, you were also good. - Thanks Gus, said

Dorothy ( Jane Russell)"". Enjoy it.",1135123200,3,959,4.43859649122807

Madonna's wanna-be Marilyn in the similar dress from her video ""Material Girl"" was a wonderful homage to pay to the original Marilyn.  With songs like ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,"" and ""Little Rock,"" and a terrific supporting performance by Jane Russell, this is one of my all-time faves!",1125619200,5,434,4.851351351351352
473423,5,6302484383,"If you are a Marilyn Monroe fan or not this is a great movie! It's one of my all time favorites.

Marilyn is Lorelie Lee a naive blonde who loves men...as long as they are rich, because her first love is the diamond in any form she can get her hands on it! She works with her bestfriend Dorothy ( Jane Russell) as a top musical act and has sung and danced her way into the heart of a young millionaire. On his dime the two girls are on their way to Paris though he can't join them on the cruise. But his even richer daddy thinks that Lorelie is just a money grubber and is determined to prove it.

Dorothy can't find the right man to love, but it's not for lack of trying. Even with the olympic team on board she falls for the wrong guy: the private investigator sent to spy on Lorelie. She'll go through most anything to save her friend from her own stupidity though.

Monroe's classic ""Diamonds are a Girl's Bestfriend"" is a highlight of this movie in the Diamond Collection. But my favorite is Russell's ""Anyone Here for Love"". This movie is a gem for anyone who loves the older musicals!",1125446400,5,1091,4.235576923076923

Russell is so witty & almost steals Monroe's thunder. The costumes are gorgeous, the acting is comedic & the scenery is just beautiful. The best part is obviously when Marilyn performs ""Diamonds are a girl's bestfriend"" & what a great performer she is! Russell is more than impressive with her performance of ""Ain't there anyone hear for love"". One of the most jaw dropping scenes is when the girl's sashay in to the cruise ship ballroom for dinner wearing stunning bright orange(monroe) & sequined black(russell) dresses. These two are a knock out! Old Hollywood at it's very best!",1120521600,4,756,5.104838709677419
473425,4,6302484383,"I tend to go for films with weightier themes than this one, generally, but ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" is so frothy, lovely, fun, and lively that it's impossible not to enjoy.  I also tend to not go for musicals, but a couple of the numbers here are inventively staged and played out with enough charm that even an old grouch like me can appreciate them.  And there's just enough of it all to go around for 92 minutes.  Kewl.

Having said all that, let me state the obvious:  This is all about Marilyn Monroe.  Young folks who have only seen brief shots of her as a Hollywood icon would do well to see this movie, so they can get an idea of what all the hubbub has been about in the decades since her tragic death that ended her tragic life.  Rarely has an actress lit up the screen so completely; the estimable Jane Russell is a sad dog by comparison, although she is fine and lovely here in her own right.

Marilyn is just so right on, so cuddly and cute, curvaceously sexy yet sweet, evilly money-hungry but apparently from such innocent motives, that one (at least this male) can't help but adore her.  She presents herself here as the alpha woman-child, and the typical heterosexual male cannot resist and literally has to tear his eyes away from her to see if anything else is going on.  I never liked her overly mobile upper lip, but such was her magic that even that affectation is made lovely.

Yes, the entertainment world lost one of the most special ladies in its history when Marilyn passed on.  This film is literally the only time I've ever looked at extras and thought how wonderful it would have been to just share the set with the star for a day.  ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" is the dictionary definition of lightweight Hollywood musical, in which the leading ladies and their verve carries the day all by themselves.  With Marilyn, it is enough.",1112054400,16,1862,4.502976190476191
473426,3,6302484383,"Yup, it`s her film and she shines all through it. As a musical production it isn`t up to much compared what they did over at Metro. But the performances survive and Marilyn`s ""Diamond`s are a Girl`s Best Friend"" is an eternal showstupper - just as Gene Kelly`s Singin`in the Rain, Judy`s Over The Rainbow or Julie Andrews`The Sound of Music are all magic moments in the history of the movie musicals.

Jane Russell does hold her own and Charles Coburn is a delight as well.

S. soldiers who have died in Iraq-- at least those we have the names of-- I needed a little Christmas in May and found it by watching again this little cotton candy movie. Based on the work by Anita Loos, directed by Howard Hawks and starring Mariyn  Monroe and Jane Russell, GENTLEMAN PREFER BLONDES was just what the doctor ordered. With great musical numbers, hooty costumes-- particularly those of Ms. Russell-- and a plot as silly and inane as is humanly possible-- can anyone be so dumb as to think that a diamond tiara goes around her neck-- the film will convince you, if only temporarily, that the world is not going to hell tomorrow in a wheelbarrow. It's interesting to see how much movies got away with in the oppressive 50's as evidenced in the quite sexy number with Ms. Russell and the scantily clad males from the U. S. Olympic Team, her fellow travelers on the boat trip to Paris.
Ms. Russell is no slouch as a comedic actress and gets off some good one-liners here. And Ms. Monroe, though often imitated, will never be equalled for what she was, the epitome of the blonde bombshell.

473472,5,6302484383,"In death, as in life, the legend of Marilyn Monroe endures as one of the most instantly recognisable images of popular culture. She is an Icon, representing numerous things to us all - sex appeal, classic Hollywood, frailty, tragedy, and womanhood - and it is in 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', her first major motion picture, that we see the beginnings of the legacy that she would grow to leave behind.
Put simply, this is Monroe's finest comedy hour. She plays the idiotic-yet-sharp Lorelei Lee, a gold-digging man-crazed showgirl in love with a wealthy heir. En route to Paris, where she will meet her beloved, she and her friend & partner, Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) run into an Olympic team of men, fall in and out of love, commit grant larceny and run afoul of the law. The scene is set for possibly one of Hollywood's greatest ever musical comedies.
Monroe is all curves and wide-eyed innocence, but it's in her private exchanges with Russell, her fiancee's meddling father, and one very unlucky Maitre' D., that we see her genius ability to play it smart, whilst retaining all of her doe-eyed sex-appeal. Jane Russell's character Dorothy is the opposite of Monroe's Lorelei, hunting for a poor-but-sensitive man in a sea of wealthy diamond miners and sleazy private detectives. Russell is the perfect foil to Monroe, both visually and vocally - her raven-haired, scarlet-lipped and deep-voiced Dorothy is the polar opposite of the pink and fluffy Lorelei, and the pair have wonderful on-screen chemistry - the scene where they attempt to steal a camera film from the hapless Ernie Malone (Elliot Reed) is sure proof of this - and the reprise of 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend', sung by Russell in Monroe drag - is a wonderful illustration of the powerful contrast between these two actresses. Monroe and Russell play their parts with conviction and gusto - they look like they're having a blast. We can't help but love them.
The score of the movie also deserves a special mention, as it's as important as any of the players. Songs like 'Bye Bye Baby' and 'Two Little Girls from Little Rock' more than hold their own against the show's more famous tunes - 'Diamonds' and 'Ain't there anyone here for Love?'.  Howard Hawkes' direction, too, is worthy of a mention, his cameras are unobtrusive and unpretentious - he allows the starlets free reign of the screen, and it pays off with dividends. Never has glamour been more palpable.
The supporting cast (Elliot Reed, Charles Coburn and Tommy Noonan) give decent performances, but this is Monroe and Russell's show anyway, and one frankly doesn't care who the leading men are - Marilyn and Jane could dance on a screen with Casanova and we'd still only have eyes for them.
All in all, 'Gentlemen' is the feel-good kind of musical that you'll remember always. It's simple, flashy, funny, and completely entertaining. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1070409600,2,2907,4.896551724137931
473473,5,6302484383,"By the time Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was released in 1953, Marilyn Monroe had already made quite a name for herself with memorable small roles in such films as All About Eve; co-starring roles in such great little comedies as We're Not Married, As Young as You Feel, and Monkey Business; and impressive leading roles in the dramatic thrillers Don't Bother to Knock and Niagara.  It conjunction with her prominent role in How to Marry a Millionaire, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes made 1953 the year of Marilyn Monroe and established her as a full-fledged movie star.  I love this film for more reasons than I count.  For starters, it was the first Marilyn film I ever saw, giving birth to my obsession with The Goddess.  More importantly, this film is Marilyn's first musical, and she and her voice acquit themselves very well indeed.  The cast is terrific, the humor is genuine and abundant, and Marilyn absolutely steals the show from her brunette counterpart Jane Russell (even though Russell was paid far, far more than Marilyn for her role in the film).
Lorelei Lee (Marilyn) and Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) are just two little girls from Little Rock, entertainers and best of friends.  Lorelei is obsessed with finding a rich husband, and she definitely has Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan) eating out of her hands; the only problem is that Gus' rich father doesn't approve of her.  Thus are plans made for Lorelei to sail to France, where she and Gus will be married after he arrives a short while later.  Gus' dad sends a private detective by the name of Ernie Malone (Elliott Reid) along on the journey to spy on Lorelei, and he of course ends up falling in love with Dorothy.  Lorelei works her magic on Sir Francis ""Piggy"" Beekman (played brilliantly by beloved character actor Charles Coburn) leading Esmond (via Malone's report) to call off the wedding and cut Lorelei off financially, and Dorothy and Malone have a falling out once his real identity is discovered.  Stuck in Paris without money or a place to stay, Lorelei and Dorothy go back to entertaining, but their troubles don't end there.  Things get pretty wild toward the end, but naturally all the major players are reunited in the end.
Marilyn is divine as the blonde, acquisitive Lorelei Lee, and it could be said that she was never lovelier than she was in this movie.  This ""dumb blonde"" could be smart when she needed to be, and she dispenses some unforgettable advice and classic lines here.  She worries about Dorothy because, unlike her, Dorothy only seems to fall for poor men, and Lorelei tells her that she wants her ""to be happy - and stop having fun.""  Her attempts to set Dorothy up with a rich man on the ship backfire when her chosen Mr. Right ends up being a little boy, but Mr. Henry Spofford III (George Winslow) adds some unforgettable laughs to the mix.  Perhaps my favorite line from the film comes when Lorelei is trying to talk ""Piggy"" into giving her his wife's tiara: ""It's a terrible thing to be lonesome, especially in the middle of a crowd.""  That line has always stuck with me because it really applies so well to Marilyn's own personal life.
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes boasts of a number of great songs, barreling right out of the gates with Marilyn and Russell singing A Little Girl From Little Rock.  Bye Bye Baby is an impressive and rather elaborate number, Russell's performance of the song Ain't There Anyone Here for Love to the backdrop of the U.S. Olympic team is quite memorable, and the Monroe-Russell number When Love Goes Wrong, Nothing Goes Right is fantastic and really shows Monroe's comfort level with her singing and dancing.  All of these pale to the really big number, though.  Perhaps only the skirt blowing scene from The Seven Year Itch is more famous than Monroe's knockout performance of the song Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.
I don't consider Gentlemen Prefer Blondes to be Marilyn's best movie, but I would recommend it as the starting point to those yet to glimpse the power and beauty of the Goddess.  If you want to understand the Marilyn phenomenon, this is where you want to begin because Marilyn is simply mesmerizing from the first frame to the last here.  It's actually quite difficult to take your eyes off of Marilyn long enough to fully appreciate this movie for its own sake, so I recommend multiple viewings.",1064275200,10,4343,4.741035856573705
473474,4,6302484383,"When I decided to really get into La Monroe back in 1989, I chose her first starring movie and the one that influenced Madonna's ""Material Girl"" video.  That was Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monroe's first starring role.
The opening number, ""Little Girl From Little Rock"", is actually a snappy pleasant number featuring both Lorelei and Dorothy in the long red-sequined gowns with slits on the side.  In the process, we learn that Lorelei is getting married to Gus Esmond, whose father is rich.  How materialistic is Lorelei?  Dorothy tells her ""you're the only girl in the world who can stand in a stage with a  spotlight in her eyes and still see a diamond inside a man's pocket.""  She's also quite a kisser, as she leaves Gus momentarily paralyzed.
While on the boat to Paris with a letter of credit from Gus, both girls have various encounters.  Lorelei is turned up to ten, maybe eleven, when she encounters Sir Francis ""Piggy"" Beatman, who owns the second largest diamond claim in South Africa and whose wife owns a tiara Lorelei really covets.  Dorothy falls for Ernie Malone, who as it transpires, is to keep an eye on Lorelei on behalf of Gus's father and to report any hint of scandal.  However, on the boat, we see differences between the two girls.  Lorelei can't understand Dorothy's focus on good looks instead of money.  ""Honey, did it occur to you that some people don't care about money?"" Dorothy tells her friend.
The set designs for the ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" number, with the bright red and black motifs, and the tuxedoed men with candy-cane ties wielding diamonds, the women in pink dresses, and of course La Monroe herself is THE highlight in this film, and worth watching for it alone.  In fact, the theme of this song and Madonna's ""Material Girl"", which copied this number's set design, are very similar.  As for the other numbers, the duo's ""When Love Goes Wrong Nothing Goes Right"" at the cafe, both dressed in blue, comes in third, second being the opening number.
I'm ambivalent about Marilyn's performance as Lorelei.  I can separate her from the character.  While I can't stand her gold-digging attitude, there are some moments of cuteness and wit,
When Gus tells her what a letter of credit is, Lorelei says, ""That's wonderful.  Be sure and write me everyday.  I'll be lonesome.""  I've gotta admit that Marilyn is simply stunning in this picture.
Jane Russell (Dorothy) plays the loyal sidekick with a rapier wit, not as good as Eve Arden, but good enough.  She does well in her solo number, ""Ain't There Anyone Here For Love?"" where she dances amid the pituitary cases that form the Olympic relay team.

Other great dialogue comes from the Olympians making a veiled remark on the womens' anatomy.  ""Hey Steve, suppose the ship got hit by an iceberg.  Which one would you save from drowning?""  Steve replies, ""Those girls couldn't drown.""  Oooohh, good one, Steve!
The initial feature is a brief Movietone newsreel with Monroe and Russell putting their sigs and handprints in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
As a musical comedy of the 1950's, the peak of the conformist, materialistic America, it serves as a time capsule of attitudes.  In Lorelei and Dorothy, we also see the two values of the times embodied.  Lorelei prefers men with money while Dorothy's taste is for someone with good looks, answering Malone's question, ""how can two girls be so different and be such good friends.""  Today, this attitude is mostly dated, as hopefully, while it's okay to look for money and/or looks in one's ideal opposite, that isn't everything.  I say this due to myself, because I have neither looks or money.  I can best sum this up that it comes alive with the snazzy musical numbers, particularly the opening one and of course ""Diamonds"".  Rating:  3.5, rounded to 4.",1063411200,2,3808,4.803379416282642

The 1953 musical comedy Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was produced by Sol C Siegel and directed by Howard Hawks.  This color film stars Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell as feisty showgirls Lorelei and Dorothy.  These showgirls have one thing on their minds and that is to find love and money.  Lorelie (Monroe) uses her nave innocence and stunning looks to place men under her spell.  Dorothy ( Russell ) is up to the same the tricks but is more outspoken, she just loves to play the game.  When these two showgirls work together men do not stand a chance
Lorelie and Dorothy set sail aboard an upscale cruise ship for France with the intention to find love, money, diamonds, or even better all three.  Once onboard they find the men's Olympic team, diamond miners and one bothersome detective.  Malone a private investigator sent by Lorelie's future father in-law to make sure she behaves properly throws a kink in Lorelie's plans.  The plot thickens when Malone's cover is blown and girls pull out all the stops to retrieve any damaging evidence he might have against Lorelie.  Once in France the girls run into more trouble of their own when the law is looking for stolen diamonds.  Malone has trouble of his own; he did not plan on falling in love with Dorothy and now must convince her his feelings are genuine.
In a short 92 minutes we are entertained by both comedy and music.  The soundtrack really adds to the movie as we hear classics like; ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend,"" Bye Bye Baby"" and ""Ain't There Anyone Here for Love"" performed.

The difference between the two ladies' approaches to love and men is shown up best in their separate showstoppers. Marilyn, of course, has the very famous ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" where the gray templed guys in tails play a distant second to her rapture for diamond bracelets, while Jane sings a lusty, ""Ain't There Anyone Here for Love?"" in the ocean liner's workout room which just happens to be totally crammed with a bunch of Olympic jocks in all sorts of interesting poses.

GENTLEMAN PREFER BLONDES is the mov that contains the immortal scene of Marylin singing ""Diamonds are the Girls Best Friends"".
It's much more than that, it's a light romantic comedy with Marylin and Jane Russel finding their ideal and millionaire husbands. Most of the action occurs in a cruise in the Atlantic also with old Charles Coburn delivering good moments with both girls.
If we compare this one to SEVEN YEAR ITCH or BUS STOP we see that they're obviously superior, yet somehow this one became famous probably to the color of Marylin's hair. In fact I conly count one or two really funny sequences, while other Marylin's movs have non-stop gags.

This wonderful glittering gem of a movie is a Technicolor showcase for the eye-filling talents of Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe as showgirls on the prowl aboard a luxury liner and later in Paris. Based on Anita Loos' story and play, the two ladies work well together and each have showstopping musical numbers---Marilyn's ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" which is now legendary, and Russell's ""Ain't There Anyone Here for Love"" done around the ship's pool with the ""Olympic Drill Team"" as background eye candy. They're working out on various equipment and clad in tight flesh colored skimpy shorts that give added lustre to the phrase ""Beefcake"". How this got past the censors is anybody's guess since it's so homoerotic. Maybe they were too busy keeping an eye on Jane. Anyway, you can't go wrong with this classic.

Charles Coburn is a delight as an old rapscallion Monroe takes a liking to because of his diamond mine and a tiara that belongs to his wife that she cons him out of. He's so smitten with her that he's utterly charming. Monroe and Russell are a formidable duo and the film is completely delightful from start to finish. The costumes by Travilla are stunning as well. A must for Monroe and Russell fans. They should have been teamed again. And it's gorgeous on DVD.",1035936000,2,1351,4.753191489361702

473562,5,6302484383,"Novelty films are often the ones that attract me most. In ""Blondes,"" you have a novelty of two beautiful showgirls who seek male companionship, but they're each looking for different things. Loreli (Monroe) is interested in money, but only one man, Dorothy (Russell) is not interested in money, but essentially any man!! Then when she falls for a man, there is a wonderful conflict-of-interest between her romance versus her loyalty to her best friend. That may be the greatest novelty of all: female bonding on screen. This is one of very few movies I've seen my whole life which shows women as friends instead of rivals or cunning backstabbers- a fantasy which could've only been invented in Hollywood. The relationship with these ladies reminds me more of the women I know in real life. Women tend to be more frank with each other then with men, but they are rarely as nasty as movies like to show them. These are the scenes I enjoy the most: Monroe looking out for Russell's financial welfare, Russell protecting Monroe from detective Reid, while reminding her that money isn't everything. And when they first strut into the ship's dining room in their chic evening gowns- my God!! G-rated sex appeal!!",1028851200,,1206,4.859223300970874
473563,5,6302484383,"Howard Hawks was a true magician since it was hard - and it would be today, too - to avoid of being vulgar, offensive or morbid while telling the story of two women who are in love with men: one because she loves rich men and one because she loves handsome and sinewy men.
However this movie isn't just a proof of the ability of one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors: this is the triumph of Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell since they appear as beautiful women and skilled actresses, furthermore they are supported by a good cast of characters - first of all Charles Coburn and Elliott Reid. Overall this is a milestone of the american cinema in the 50's.
This DVD edition presents restored tracks both in audio than video. The audio is clear and brilliant - in my opionion this is one of the best track realized from a movie of the 50's - while the video presents vigorous colors and sharp detail.",1028505600,5,904,4.451807228915663
473593,5,6302484383,"To me, there are two ""movie Marilyns."" The touching, sad, gentle creature who needed to be protected, as in her later roles, such as ""Bus Stop"", and ""The Misfits."" And, the comic, nuclear bombshell that devestated all men in her path, as in her earlier roles. This film perfectly embodies all the qualities of the latter, and, to many, remains her definitive role. She is amazingly incandescent, and a natural comic, as ""Lorelei Lee"", the not so dumb gold-digger with a penchant for diamonds. This film may not be politically correct, I don't think Gloria Steinem is ever going to like it, but, in the context of the story, and the time in which it was made, it is entertainingly funny, and visually, a knock-out. She is accompanied in her adventures by Jane Russell, wonderful as ""Dorothy"", and their behind the scene comaraderie is apparent, for they complement each other perfectly on screen. Though Carol Channing originated the role on Broadway, from the Anita Loos play, it is Marilyn who will forever be identified as Lorelei. This was the role which made her a star, and she took everyone, including Fox head Darryl Zanuck, by surprise, with her comic panache and singing ability. In fact, Zanuck, who underappreciated Monroe during her association with Fox, at first refused to believe it was Marilyn singing, until the lady herself marched into his office, and sang the songs ""live."" Marilyn is not only breath-takingly gorgeous in this role, but has a comic delivery which, for all her reported problems on set, is beyond comparison, save for perhaps Judy Holliday. And her big finale, ""Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend"", remains a classic musical moment in cinema. This is the film of a Marilyn with fame and adulation just before her and, while it was natural for her to want to expand to deeper roles, which she later did, at the time of this film she was content just to have the world at her feet. Jane Russell, who was immensely generous to the comparative newcomer Marilyn, spoke lovingly of her then, and does to this day. She is not only a star, but a wonderful lady, immune to the jealousy and contempt that many who came in contact with M.M. felt towards her. Try and forget the dated aspects of this film, and just enjoy the sumptuous beauty and natural comic genius of Marilyn Monroe, Hollywoods greatest legend.",1027296000,5,2336,4.770370370370371
473594,5,6302484383,"While it will never compete with the likes of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, GIGI, or MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, this 1953 confection is nonetheless a real charmer.  Based on a popular Broadway show which was itself based on the famous novel by Anita Loos, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES tells the story of two cabaret performers--blonde bombshell Loreli Lee, who is determined to marry for money, and brunette beauty Dorothy Shaw, who prefers to marry for love.  When Loreli's engagement to a millionaire's son goes awry, the two set sail for Europe, and comic complications ensue.  The story is traditional fluff, pure and simple, and there is nothing in the least innovative or unexpected about the film as a whole--but it is all extremely, extremely well done.
The score is bright, including such tunes as the famous ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend""--and all the musical numbers are cleverly staged and filmed.  The overall look of the film is also eye popping: the ladies are dressed to perfection and the color cinematography is truly joyous.  The script is full of comfortable wit, director Hawks keeps it moving at a nice clip, and the cast includes such enjoyable performers as Charles Coburn, Tommy Noonan, Norma Varden, and George Winslow.  But what really makes the film memorable are Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, who simply sparkle with star quality and play their with roles in a twinkle-in-the-eye style.
Monroe and Russell have remarkable chemistry on screen, and although neither were really singers they each had enjoyable and very distinctive singing voices; their performances are so pleasantly amusing that you can't help but smile.  Both also had a way with comedy, with Monroe offering her quintessential 'not so dumb blonde' and Russell matching her all the way as the wise-to-you brunette determined to keep Monroe out of trouble.  And so well do they work together it is hard to pick a favorite between the two.  Call it fluff, froth, foolish--but even jeweler Harry Winston couldn't refuse this good time, even at the risk of a diamond or two.  Thoroughly enjoyable for any one still capable of a smile.",1021420800,72,2116,4.951977401129944
473595,4,6302484383,Marylin Monroe is one of the best actresses in hollywood history.  This is one of her most notable and famed movies.  Gentleman Prefer Blondes.,1015200000,,143,4.916666666666667
473596,2,6302484383,"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a film with a ridiculous premise and some pretty wooden performances.  Marilyn Monroe plays an avaricious bubblehead and Jane Russell plays her rude, oversexed friend.  I found none of the characters likable, with the possible exception of the precocious little rich boy who spends his onscreen time staring at the prodigious bosoms of the two leading ladies.
Most of my time watching this insipid, candy-coated musical was spent with my jaw slack and my eyes glazed.  Only occasionally was the glimpse of some deeper plot shown, such as the rationale behind Marilyn's intense need for rich men.
Still, I couldn't help think that if women were really like this, it would certainly excuse a whole lot of misogyny.
The costumes in the film are divine, however.  I couldn't help but be thankful the fashions today don't dictate such obviously painful foundation garments.  There's no way anyone would fit so nicely into those wasp-waisted dresses without a killer girdle.
The best part of the entire film is definitely the famous ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" performance by Marilyn Monroe.  Her song and dance act is excellent, and definitely worth watching, if only as a video clip.",1014681600,7,1215,5.05

in portholes, falling in swimming pools, and getting arrested
they retain the grace, beauty, and humor of an era sadly lost.
One other thing that makes this movie stand out is a little boy,

MM's screen persona transcends all of the attempts to reduce her to a case study or to exploit her image through imitation.  Simply put, no one played Marilyn Monroe better than Norma Jean Baker, who makes the screen come alive in every frame in which her persona appears.  To compare her to co-star Jane Russell or to a latter-day impersonator such as Madonna (""Material Girl"") is to appreciate all the more the inimitable vibrancy of the original.  Howard Hawks' admittedly slight comedy works because of Marilyn, who conquers not merely the males in the cast but makes submissive, willing fools of us all.

Marilyn is wonderful - incredibly funny (i.e., the scenes with the small rich kid) and as everyone knows, she gives a dynamite performance on ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.""

Other extremely entertaining songs are the catchy ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" and ""Is there Anyone here for Love?"".  ""When Love Goes Wrong... nothing goes right....""

A comedy with lots of song and dance numbers that show off Marilyn Monroe & Jane  Russell to best effect, it is the story of two nightclub performers from  Little Rock who set out to snag themselves millionaire husbands. Loralei  & Dorothy set sail for France, and become embroiled in on-board  hi-jinx, Loralei using her abundant charms to try and entice a rich  industrialist to part with his diamonds, and Dorothy dueling with the  private detective hired by Loralei's fiancee to keep an eye on her. The  usual mishaps ensue, and it all ends happy as would be expected, so don't  expect a brain workout, but it is an enjoyable vehicle for the two stars,  with lavish costuming and sets all in glorious 1950's colour; and Marilyn  & Jane bounce off each other well, getting some witty lines that send  up both themselves as sex symbols, and also the maneaters they portray. And  of course, there's that classic Monroe moment - the ""Diamonds are a  Girl's Best Friend"" number, which shows Marilyn at her glamourous,  iconically beautiful best. Everyone should see that number at least once,  and for Monroe fans, Blondes is  an  interesting example of the dumb blonde  roles the studios would have liked to keep her in forever. It's not to  everyone's taste - those who don't appreciate Marilyn often find it a bit  embarrassing, but perhaps an interest piece for you to try on your own one  afternoon if you're curious.",945820800,8,1551,4.6286764705882355
