3017760,5,B000Y9WO2Y,"I use this with children when they have experienced a loss of any type.
Death, divorce, home, or relocating to a new school.
I actually have a cast iron pot that I let them make tear soup. They add memories, emotions, thoughts, or whatever they want to on small piece of paper and add it to their soup. After, they stir it and scoop their soup (paper) out into a small plastic container, which they can take home or leave and add to it later. Great therapeutic tool!!!!",1390521600,3,469,4.340909090909091

3017765,5,B000Y9WO2Y,"I encountered this book several years ago volunteering at a center for grief recovery in children.  Don't be misled this is a timeless book for all who are grieving no matter what the age.  This is a very well written, the pictures easily help you identify with the characters and it presents the various stages of grief in a easy to understand format that anyone will identify with the making of Tear Soup..

I can't rave enough about this.",1367798400,3,627,4.456140350877193

3017767,5,B000Y9WO2Y,This book / DVD was recommended to me by my Dr. to help me understand grief due to a sudden family tragedy.  My husband and I have both watched it over and over.  It really has been a great source of comfort and taught me better understanding.,1357776000,2,243,4.148936170212766

3017769,5,B000Y9WO2Y,"This is the best book for grieving adults I've ever read. It puts what is going on inside in simple terms with incredible meaning. While the book is intended, I think, to explain the grieving process to children through the example of a grandmother explaining the making of ""tear soup"" to her grandson, this book resonates with adults and gives them permission to grieve in their own way in their own time. When we are caught up in grief, we often want to return to simpler, easier times. What better tool than a seemingly children's book. And the illustrations are wonderful. As a pastor I keep at least three of these on hand at all times.",1318291200,7,641,4.5344827586206895

8231384,5,B000Y9WO2Y,"I use this book in my psychotherapy practice to assist patients dealing with grief. The 15 min video mirrors the book, which I then lend out to share with their family. It is such a wonderful story, told in a soothing way. It has helped others to free themselves to express their grief rather than stifling it because they feel it has ""been too long."" Highly recommend!",1390867200,,369,4.522388059701493
