1109488,4,6306011005,"What is history?  Is it nothing more than the accounts we read in books of the exploits of various kings, queens, generals, armies, nations etc. as they wage war or deliberate peace throughout the endless millennia?  Or is it - as Tolstoy implied - the sum total of the day-to-day actions of ordinary human beings eking out an existence on this unique little planet we call Earth?
These are the questions posed by Stanley Tucci's ""Joe Gould's Secret,"" an intriguing little film based on the true story of a well-known eccentric who lived amongst and associated with the New York literati of the 1940's.  This tale is really about two ""Joes"" - Joe Mitchell, a highly successful writer at ""The New Yorker,"" and Joe Gould, a strange but alluring figure who shuffles his way around town begging for handouts, yet who claims to be a writer currently involved in authoring a monumental ""oral history"" of the world around him.  Intrigued by this true eccentric, Mitchell decides to feature Gould in one of his magazine pieces.  Thus, the two Joes spend countless hours together as Mitchell examines, records and tries to understand the lifestyle and thoughts of this most unique and extraordinary of individuals.
The best part about ""Joe Gould's Secret"" is that it allows the title character to remain something of an enigma throughout.  It doesn't try to ""explain"" him or rob him of the ambiguity that makes him so fascinating a figure.  In many ways, Gould fits perfectly the image of the artist we have come to romanticize and even glorify in our minds over the years.  He is often gruff, irrational and temperamental, prone to wide mood swings and occasional violent outbursts, yet he is also capable of making profound insights and he possesses an innate ability to afflict the ""comfortable"" living in their smug little materialistic worlds - a tendency that endears him to the, perhaps, equally smug Bohemians around him.  That he has to ""suffer"" for his art - he is virtually homeless and relies on the pecuniary contributions of his ""friends"" to get him by - only elevates his standing both in his own eyes and the eyes of many others.  Credit the complex screenplay by Howard A. Rodman for being able to see that Gould may himself be suffering from delusions of grandeur that the people who admire him and the work he is doing simply reinforce - perhaps because they like to have a ""colorful"" character hanging around or because it makes them feel good to be minimally and patronizingly kind to a fellow human being (you will note that only one of his concerned ""friends"" or patrons is willing to provide him with a place to live - so much easier to hand him a few dollars and send him on his way).  Even Mitchell becomes highly conflicted in his feelings towards Gould.  Though at first intrigued by his eccentric nature, Mitchell, once the article is published and Gould has served his purpose, begins to see the man as little more than a daily annoyance, a time-consuming irritant to be gotten rid of.  As Gould slips ever further into the realm of societal castoff, ""Joe Gould's Secret"" begins to take on the air of a profoundly sad human tragedy.
Yet, in the end, it is what Joe Gould stands for - his insistence that we shine a light on the forgotten members of the working class and the down-on-their-luck societal ""losers"" - that ends up making the strongest mark on both Mitchell and us in the audience.  Though we are often appalled by the lifestyle Gould lives, we can't help but acknowledge the truth of his core conviction.  Real history CAN be found every bit as much in the words, faces and lives of those people lurking in dingy pubs and toiling away in sweaty factories as it can in the royal courts and on the bloody battlefields that somehow preoccupy so many of the world's historians.
Ian Holm gives a brilliant performance as Gould, managing to appear both larger and smaller than life as the situation warrants.  Whether he is rhapsodizing poetically about the meaning of life or extending his palm out in a poignant gesture of humiliating beggary, Holm makes Gould a completely believable and thoroughly unique character.  Tucci, as Mitchell, the passive observer, has the less flamboyant role, but he manages to convey the seemingly contradictory nature of a man who wants both to remain skeptical and to believe in the ""truth"" of Gould and what he stands for.
""Joe Gould's Secret"" transports us to a fascinating time and place and gives us much food for thought once we get there.",992131200,20,4508,4.744245524296675
1109489,4,6306011005,"Thematically rich film even though it has trouble juggling everything smoothly.  Tucci never really prioritizes his themes and as a result, the profoundness of the ""secret"" is obscured.  I was still won over however because, well, because these topics are just not given enough attention in mainstream films.  On the surface, it appears that Tucci is examining the tumultuous relationship between the two Joes, but the real subject is the equally chaotic relationship between artists and their artistic endeavours.  Tucci examines how artists endure much suffering for their work and as a result, they tread a fine line between genius and madness.  He also seems to be saying that if the artistic impulse is not reined in, it can potentially become destructive because the truth that artists feel compelled to convey is much too complex and diverse to be expressed merely by the simple tools at the artists' disposal.  In fact, Gould's oral history reminded me of the director's rushes at the end of Assayas' ""Irma Vep"" -- an unrestrained vision gone haywire, short circuited by the futile attempt to express grand and divine ideas in a conventional format.  Tucci touches upon other themes as well, such as the difference between patronage and commercialism, the root of artistic inspiration, the responsibility of journalists for their subjects, etc. but they do not really go anywhere.  When the ""secret"" is revealed, in a most nonchalant manner, by the closing captions of the film (the ""secret"" is actually multi-layered -- there is another ""secret"" on the story surface, readily apparent just from the plot), a chill went down my spine.  Consequently, it made me re-examine the whole story and although ""Joe Gould's Secret"" is a good story, it isn't the main story nor the most compelling one, or otherwise the film would have been called ""Joe Mitchell's Secret"".  It's puzzling why Tucci approached the story the way he did, but this movie is still a winner, and it's nice to finally watch a film that is bloated with ideas.  The detailed set-pieces of New York in the '40s are also a treat to look at.  Ian Holm gives the performance that is conspicuously remarkable, but it's Stanley Tucci's performance, which is nearly invisible next to Holm's, that becomes more noteworthy upon reflection, particularly after pondering the meaning of the film's closing captions.",991958400,2,2374,5.074550128534704
1109490,4,6306011005,"Was he a brilliant and misunderstood bohemian, or merely a mentally deranged hobo with scant moments of lucidity?  This is one of the questions broached by this thought provoking period piece based on a true story.  Joe Gould (Ian Holm) became a local legend of sorts in the 1940's and `50's as he lived on the streets of Greenwich Village in Manhattan during that section's most outlandish and offbeat era.  According to the legend, Gould was writing the ""Oral History of the World"" supposedly scratching down his thoughts and the conversations of common folks in composition books.  This story follows the relationship developed between Joe Gould, a Harvard graduate cum decadent; and Joe Mitchell (Stanley Tucci), a prominent writer for New Yorker Magazine during the period, who wrote the book on which this film is based.
Gould was generally well liked, and he could be charming and engaging when doing his bohemian act for the locals, who were won't to enjoy the raw humanity of it.  Thus, despite his disheveled and odoriferous attributes, he was often welcome at parties given by affluent socialites.  He had a symbiosis with the neighborhood, a mutually parasitic relationship where he used them for their money and they used him to indulge their desire to consider themselves avant-garde by consorting with free spirits.
He easily manipulated various residents into contributing significant alms, which he would promptly squander on alcohol.  This became even truer after Mitchell wrote an article about him in New Yorker Magazine and his celebrity mushroomed.  The film tells his story without over-romanticizing him and unabashedly presents his dark side (bordering on sociopathic) marked by alcoholism, temper tantrums, belligerent outbursts and generally disturbed behavior.
Stanley Tucci's direction of this film again bears his trademark attention to human details, presenting a very perceptive look at the human condition.  As always, his work with the actors to get the right feelings on film was excellent.  He also captured the period precisely in his use of costumes, props and Greenwich Village locations, most of which are unchanged from 50 years ago.  He does a good job of peeling away Gould's faade, which begins with a look at him as a colorful and interesting character and reveals him ultimately as grossly imbalanced.
If there were criticisms of Tucci's presentation, they would have to be about pace and content.  The film isn't excessively long, but at times, it feels that way.  Though this was a wonderfully in-depth character study, it trod over the same ground repeatedly, rather than offering an array of fresh perspectives.
The acting was exceptional.  Ian Holm gives a brilliant performance as Gould.  It is difficult to imagine a more complex and demanding character.  Holm was engaging, charming, cantankerous, belligerent and occasionally insightfully deep.  Holm was fully immersed in his character and he gave a truly inspired portrayal.  Stanley Tucci was also very good as the sullen and impassive journalist.  His southern accent was only passable, but his genteel southern style was excellent and his conflict and concern came across as genuine.
This film requires a patient and intelligent viewer.  I rated it an 8/10 on the strength of the acting and the insightful character study, despite its sluggish pace.  If you enjoy human-interest stories and probing character studies, I would recommend you try it.",972518400,2,3457,5.249090909090909
1109491,3,6306011005,"""Joe Gould's Secret"" is certainly not a great film, nor an unusually good one.  I liked it because it is a very thoughtful film, from a thoughtful director (Stanley Tucci).  I've found that very few films are interested in examining the process of writing; perhaps this reflects the minimal effort put into most screenplays these days.  The pair of Joes in this movie - Joe Mitchell, a writer for the New Yorker, and Joe Gould, a Bohemian eccentric - form a sort of symbiotic couple.  Ian Holm's performance of Joe Gould is one of the most lovely acts of biography I've seen in a few years.  His performance is not an extended act of sympathy, but a complicated portrait of a man who made very deliberate and unconventional decisions about how to live his life.  Though it's not a great movie, I would gladly revisit it for another viewing.",972259200,2,840,4.604026845637584
1109492,5,6306011005,"One negative comment I heard after the Sundance Premere of this film may best explain what is extraordinary about this film.  The comment was ""There was no real story, what was the meaning of this film?""  After a kneejerk reaction, I realized that story may not be visible to everyone, but if you are aware enough it is an enlightening and an obvious story.  The story is simple; the preson next to you may, if you are so inclined, touch you in so many ways, weather you want them to or not.  It is this human interaction that is the essance of life, espeacially in a place like New York City.  Stanley Tucci has a gift that so many directors disire.  Stanley speaks to the audience with characters, not the cameras.  Maybe this is because he is a character and he understands that the story is told throught its charaters.  In any case, Stanley has caputured the best of this allstar cast with the therory ""Less is more."" In short, if you have any dersire to be enriched in many facets of life, then and now, do yourself a favor and purchase this film.  I think you'll realize that Joe Gould isn't the only person with a secret he can't wait the share with the world.",970185600,2,1168,4.37037037037037
7899431,3,6306011005,"The action takes place in New York City in the 1940s, Joe Gould died in 1957, and Joe Mitchell wrote the book Joe Goulds Secret in 1964 to reveal the secret.  I lived in New York in the 1940s and redd the book when it first came out.  I found the book better than the movie, for the following reason:
 The climax of the story comes when the secret is reveal.  After that the book comes to an end fairly quickly with a brief summing up.  But the movie continues on for about 30 minutes, diminishing the dramatic impact.  Thus it becomes a biography of Joe Gould, rather than a good dramatic story of the revealing of his secret.  It could have profited from some extensive editing.
 There are many excellent features of the movie (which other reviewers have mentioned) but I only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because of what it might have been.",1512000000,,843,4.32484076433121
7899432,4,6306011005,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had a lot going for it. Holm turns in a simply fantastic performance, Tucci is equally as good, if not much more subdued. They are ably supported by an excellent cast. The movie does an excellent job evoking the bohemian world of New York in the 1940's and, less so, of the New Yorker magazine.

Now that I think about it, the title of the movie is misleading. It is not about Joe Gould's secret, it is really about Joe Mitchell and his secret. Actually, it takes its title from a great article Mitchell wrote and is more about him and his writing. Joe Gould is not the enigma, for Holm's bravura performance is right in your face all movie long, it is Mitchell that is the puzzle.

I found the story to be engrossing, but it is an odd movie about a very odd person whom not all may be interested in (sort of like Jeff Bridges' alcoholic country singer in Crazy Heart.) The movie is not long, but it does feel that it takes its time. That said, there are few wasted screen moments, and even those that seem to dwell on Gould are, through the lens, always telling the viewer something.

What ended up really intriguing me is ""the secret"" and how it impacted on Joe Mitchell, being Tucci's character. I am not giving the movie full marks because there are a few fairly important scenes that just weren't clear to me until I had given the movie some thought and did a bit of reading. Normally I have faith that a good movie will give me all the info I need, presented in a comprehensibly way, to understand what it means and how the parts fit. And I like to think I'm a quick enough study to fill in any blanks.

So, being intrigued, I did some reading and only afterwards did I appreciate the rich and complex screenplay. It is so because Gould and Mitchell are so complex, as is their fascinating relationship.

This is all the more thought provoking in light of the recent biography of Joe Mitchell. I am not giving anything away here, as it does not impact on the movie plot, but ... Mitchell was a famed New Yorker writer, part of cadre that really gave the magazine a ""New York"" voice in the 1940s and 1950s. But it has be proven that some of his most memorable articles included characters that were composites, essentially fictionalized people. Now, while this would not stand present day journalistic scrutiny, it may have been acceptable 60+ years ago. That said, it makes you wonder about the relationship between Mitchell and Gould and their similarities. Tucci could not have known these facts, but I think this is what he was getting at in his nuanced direction and performance.

I loved Tucci and Holm in The Big Night and it was a pleasure to see them again in Joe Gould's Secret.",1436659200,,2725,4.429141716566866
7899433,5,6306011005,"Having just finished ""Man in Profile"", a recent biography of Joseph Mitchell, the veteran writer for The New Yorker, I learned of this film. Joe Gould, an eccentric New Yorker, was fascinating to author Mitchell...so much so that Mitchell and Gould became close acquaintances. Mitchell wrote about Gould and his ""secret""....not to be revealed here.

The film is terrific and Ian Holm is outstanding playing the role of Joe Gould. Equally impressive is Stanley Tucci's portryal of Joseph Mitchell, the laconic, soft-spoken writer from North Carolina. It's a film worth seeing or even revisiting if you've watched it before.",1431993600,,622,5.282828282828283
7899434,5,6306011005,"It's amazing to me, being acquainted with Joe Gould only through what Joseph Mitchell wrote about him, to read phrases like ""tumultuous relationship between the two"" and ""the artist versus society,"" etc.  There was no such relationship between the two and it's highly unlikely that Joe Gould had much more in mind with his book scam than his next drink.  Of course, not having seen the film, I can't say that these reviewers are wrong, only that that's not the Joe Gould whom Joseph Mitchell wrote about.",1342742400,,504,4.781609195402299
7899435,5,6306011005,"Based on a true story, ""Joe Gould's Secret"" could well remain a secret, despite its stellar cast and story. Ian Holm plays Joe Gould, a Harvard graduate turned street-person eccentric whom the film portrays living in 1940s New York. Stanley Tucci delivers a brilliant perforance as the real-life Joe Mitchell, a writer for The New Yorker magazine, who stumbles into Gould and his vision of the magnum opus ""oral history"" he has been writing through his life. Susan Sarandon plays a magnificent role as one of Gould's contemporaries, an avant-garde painter in that fabulous nascent period between The Bohemians and The Beatniks. And Patricia Clarkson, in a role consisting of a little more than a couple of cameos, acts the role of one of Gould's most generous patrons.
It starts out easy enough -- with Mitchell, the New Yorker writer, finding Gould at a lunch counter. Gradually a friendship is started between the two men. Mitchell eventually writes an article called ""Professor Sea Gull"" and fan letters containing a few dollars for the ""Joe Gould Fund"" start to arrive at Mitchell's office. Meanwhile, Mitchell is trying to get his hands on what he thinks might be a Holy Grail of sorts -- Gould's opus ""Oral History"" in notebooks stashed a half-dozen at a time at various patrons' and friends' houses through New York. The actual treasure trove of the 9-million word History, consisting of 20,000 interviews, remains elusive and out of Mitchell's reach. Even after Gould's death, Mitchell keeps trying to find the farmhouse, where, wrapped in oilcloth, lie the rest of Gould's notebooks and the Great Oral History. Many years later, Mitchell writes his last New Yorker piece on what he has learned about the story.",1262908800,3,1719,4.993031358885017
7899436,4,6306011005,"I watched ""Joe Gould's Secret"" without knowing that it was based on a true story, but was not surprised when that turned out to be the case because this 2000 film from actor/director Stanley Tucci rings true. Tucci plays Joe Mitchell, a columnist for ""The New Yorker"" magazine in the early 1940s who had a chance encounter with a Greenwich Village bohemian eccentric named Joe Gould (Ian Holm). His reporter's curiosity piqued, Mitchell asks around a bit and finds that Gould claims to be writing an epic Oral History of New York, an almost daily record of the conversations he has each day with the forgotten ordinary folks of the great metropolis (the Oral History has to be capitalized; that is clear from the way Gould and his friends talk about it).

The notebooks containing this million-word history are secreted around the city with the various artist friends who provide Gould patronage by listening to him and making monetary contributions to the Joe Gould Fund. The rationale for their indulgence is articulated by the painter Alice Neel (Susan Sarandon) who tells Mitchell, ""I have always felt that the city's s unconscious is trying to speak to you through Joe Gould.""

Mitchell discovers that Gould is a walking contradiction, capable of both quick bursts of anger and madness as well as perceptive insights into the human condition. He proves his credentials at being a superb listener by doing a Henry Higgins and telling Mitchell he was born in North Carolina based on a single sentence. Mitchell writes two articles about Gould for ""The New Yorker."" The first, ""Professor Sea Gull,"" makes Gould even more of a cult figure about the New York intelligentsia, and a publisher (Steve Martin) is interested in at least reading the Oral History. But Gould refuses to let excerpts be published, saying it is all or nothing, and declaring it will only be produced posthumously. Years later, after Gould died, Mitchell would write a second essay, from which this film gets its title. However the delicious irony of this film is that the secret that lies at its heart belongs as much to Mitchell as it does to Gould.

Holm has the flashy part as the brilliant madman, but it is Tucci's Mitchell that is the pivotal performance. ""Joe Gould's Secret"" is more about how Mitchell sees Gould than we do in watching the film. There is a scene early on when Mitchell tries to explain to his editor why he might want to rewrite an article that has already been accepted for publication. Mitchell gropes without success for the words to speak out loud and his editor can only laugh and point out that it is a good thing this Joe writes better than he talks. But the exchange is significant because it speaks to the depths of Joe's emotions and intellect. We see or hear little of what Mitchell writes; most of the voice over narration has him quoting the words of Joe Gould. So it is the looks on Tucci's face, the way he sets his body, the pace of his walk, that give us our only clues to the deep rivers of his heart, mind, and soul.

7899438,5,6306011005,"I'm surprised no one mentions Joe Gould's obvious psychological problems.  His own mother recognizes his difficulties when he is a very young boy.  Gould's brilliance was as profound as his lack of boundaries and thought disorders.  The dreadful trouble 'other' people eventually have when a person is not able to recognize normal adult 'self' boundaries is slowly and agonizingly developed in the film by all who care for him, especially in Joe Mitchell and the amazing Patricia Clarkson.  Joe M's sense of guilt about his own desire to withdraw to more normal distances and responsibilities grows with each encounter following the publishing of the article.  He slowly realizes Joe G's affections and dependencies on him and Gould's inabilities to follow up on his success to make a better life for himself.  Ian Holmes is absolutely magnificent in his portrayal of madness!!!!!  Stanley Tucci's emotionally profound moments build to the incredible conversation scene in the psychiatric hospital with the now medicated and more personally aware Joe G. who speaks of himself 'as a mad person'.  Joe M. realizes how much he missed/did not see of Joe G's 'total self' experience when he wrote. He used Joe G's madness for his own clever aggrandizment and had no full awareness of the man or of the impact his relationship and his writing would have on this man's delicately built 'positive' life style.  The most 'whole' description of Joe Gould's value was spoken by Susan Serandon: ""Joe G's gregarious, exhibitionistic, grandiose, scattered but profound communications of his experience with his 'friends' (as in the party scene) she recognized as speaking for the universal 'unconscious' of the unseen people of New York City AND its artists.  She valued the awareness he brought to those who were capable of allowing themselves to listen with their hearts and connect to him.""

Another parallel Tucci brought out in the film was the deadening of the brilliance of Joe G. by the 'cure' of the Hospital meds, comparing it to the deadening of Joe G.s fragile lifestyle as his connections to Joe M./others disintegrated.

I wonder if Ian Holmes and/or Stanley Tucci have had personal experience with madness in their lives, as their ability to see into all of these people is so deep?  If not, their artistic ability to see into souls, others and their own, is to be applauded, as is this incredible film, which ever way it was made.

Given the gradual and painful awareness of his role in Joe G.'s disintegration. it was not probably, in real life, a necessary outcome for Joe M. that he could not write again, but Stanley Tucci makes it crystal clear why it WAS EMOTIONALLY SO for the real Joe M.",1140739200,,2697,4.938053097345133
