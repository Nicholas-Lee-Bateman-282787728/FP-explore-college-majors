2679518,5,B000JVRFXA,"OK, I know this is censored. I know that the nudity and cuss words would have been sweet. But hey...there is some plus sides to this DVD. Such as...

1) The matches. You get 8 great rare but classic DX matches(Depends on how you look at it, you may not like some because they either cheated or it's too short).

2) At the main menu, it plays the DX Music Video in it's entirety. It's very rare to find that DX music video anywhere else and while it may play on the main menu, at least you get to see it played.

3) In case you're watching this with your kids, at least it's censored.

Those three reasons alone makes it a major selling factor.

I however happen to own the VHS version of this DVD. So I really have nothing to complain about. Plus it looks great along side my New And Improved DX DVD.

I strongly recommend this.",1258070400,2,828,4.14375

2679520,4,B000JVRFXA,"When D-X returned in 2006, WWE dusted off an old D-X video and added matches and put it on dvd to go with the craze of mega-selling D-X merchandise. This shows just how edgy D-X originally was compared to the watered down friendly D-X of today. I recommend what every reviewer says about getting the VHS for the documentary and this dvd for the matches. I think it's funny on the newer D-X video they dropped an s-bomb but it's edited out on this dvd. Also, the matches are all pre-98 so there is no censors on the classic WWF logo and even though most matches are not classic, still fun to watch. A must own for D-X fans or fans who miss the attitude era of the WWF.",1252627200,4,667,4.178294573643411

2679522,3,B000JVRFXA,"With the recent DX reunion on RAW and the re-release of this video (now on DVD), I popped this into the VCR for old times sakes. I also happen to get a copy of the DVD as a present so I'll review & compare the two.

VHS:

This was back when WWE was not only the World Wrestling Federation (seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?) but also during the Attitude era. That means that on this tape, it was WWF at it's best. The selling point of this tape, it was all uncensored. You saw some girls flashing & they let the language fly...like I said, UNCENSORED! You get mini-profiles & highlights on DX members (HHH/Chyna/HBK/New Age Outlaws) and highlights of what made DX so popular from their in & out the ring pranks, comedy, interviews and promos including all the times they picked on Michael Cole. You also end up getting some non-televised footage from their invasion of the WCW offices and CNN Towers. Overall, it was just a fun video to watch.

DVD:

Now the problem with this one was that this was put out by World Wrestling Entertainment which means that all the WWF logos are blurred out. Also, the Attitude era is over which means that WWE censored the video. You don't hear the cuss words & the footage of the flashing girls are edited out of the video. This hurts the video greatly but they try to make it up by adding 8 matches to the DVD...however the problem is that most of these matches are throwaway matches from RAW instead of more high profile matches. For example, DX had a PPV named after them but didn't have one match from it on this DVD. Anyways, here are the matches:

HBK vs. Mankind - Nope, this isn't the match from Mind Games...this is a match from RAW that was very similar to that match but only in a short time period. This match was the one that had ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude return to the WWF as Shawn's ""insurance policy.""

HBK & HHH vs. Mankind & Undertaker - This was the first time HBK & HHH teamed up together in this RAW main event, the match was actually going well but it was without a doubt the match that made Shawn a bonified heel when he kept beating up Taker with a chair to the point where he was bloodied.

HHH vs. Bret Hart - This was another average match but the bigger focus here was Shawn being Shawn & goofing around by picking his nose with the the Canadian flag at ringside.

European Title Match: HBK vs. HHH - This really wasn't even a match as it was classic D-Generation X once again playing mind games with the crowd & defying authority. This match was just like WCW's ""fingerpoke"" between Hulk Hogan & Kevin Nash except this one was actually entertaining & funny.

HBK vs. Owen Hart - Basically another average RAW match that resulted in interference & another beatdown by DX

WWF Title & Casket Match: HBK vs. Undertaker - This was actually one of the two matches on here that wasn't from RAW. This was from the Royal Rumble '98 and was the match that forced HBK to retire for years because of a serious back injury he suffered in this match. Anyways, Taker & HBK never have a bad match & this was no exception.

Non-sanctioned Match: HHH/New Age Outlaws/Savio Vega vs. Stone Cold/Cactus Jack/Chainsaw Charlie/Owen Hart - This was from No Way Out of '98 and was just an all out wild brawl full of weapons non-stop. However the real highlight came after the match when Austin gave a stunner to Chyna.

European Title Match: Triple H vs. Owen Hart - This really wasn't even a match as it was just Triple H insulting Owen Hart (who had a broken ankle) forcing him into a match which was just HHH pulling on Owen's ankle until he gave up. I guess this was here just like the other European Title match just to show classic DX manipulation.

So out of the eight matches put on here, only six of them are actual matches & only two go past the 10 minute mark. Again, they could have included the HBK vs. Ken Shamrock & HHH vs. Sgt. Slaughter matches from the DX PPV, HBK vs. British Bulldog for the European Title at One Night Only, or at least the WM14 matches involving DX. I know there were more matches from the DX involving those like X-Pac & The Outlaws but the focus of this DVD is on HBK & HHH.

As for which ones you want, it depends on what you want. If you want the documentry, get the VHS. If you want the matches, get the DVD.",1168560000,34,4293,4.30359355638166
2679523,3,B000JVRFXA,"Even though the disc is greatly edited from the original 1998 WWF released tape, i purchased it mainly for the matches. For the most part they were fantastic, until i got to the one i most wanted to see--the Michaels/Undertaker match from the 1998 Royal Rumble in San Jose. About 25 minutes of the match are shown, but inexplicably it truncates the end of the match!! You do not get to see Undertaker tossed in the coffin,or Kane set fire to it. The match also had historical value as it was the one in which Michaels sustained a (thought to be at the time) career ending back injury. I just cannot imagine why they would show 25 minutes and leave out what the match was building towards--therefore i can only give the disc 3 stars.

 The good news is that the WWE will be releasing the Royal Rumble anthology this spring and hopefully the match will again get the treatment it deserves.",1167868800,4,887,4.469135802469136
2679524,3,B000JVRFXA,"Previously owning the VHS copy released some years ago, i was highly disapointed to find that they still have not included the full DX skits in there entirity for this DVD.

It does not show the full skit they did on The Nation where X-pac plays mark Henery and says, (in a Fat Albert voice)""Hey, hey hey, Rocky!... I smell what you're cooking, quite frankly it smells like s***. But don't matter, think i'll eat some anyway"" - that skit was classic and it's not shown in its entirity.

Plus, the original was not censoured, the dvd has bleeps over the cuss words and black tape over the nudity. The bleeping out has completly ruined the DX press confrence speech about what words will and won't be used. The whole thing is just *beep*beep*beep*beep*watch your mouth*beep*beep*beep* it's just not funny when its censoured. And of coarse, the WWF logo is all blurred out throughout the whole thing, tho, its not as annoying as it used to be, there imporving there way of blurring things out, but its still enough to distarct you.

So I cant give this DVD the perfect 5 stars. Not to mention that they didn't continue on and show what became of DX since the video was released. Even tho it wasn't all that great, they shouldve at least added the footage where DX got back together and brought Tori and Stephenie McMahon into the group. Plus the one night reunion's. Sure, it may have ended as the DX group splitting up, but it was still DX. Especialy how the next 3 Disc DX dvd coming out in Feb 2007 is only going to show 2006 material.

Hopefully in future there will be a volume 2 that includes the HBK vs HHH fueds starting from at least the time when HBK was commisioner of the WWF and how all that came about then go into the reunion that happend in 2006 and so on and show the skits in there entirity.

P.S: Amazon, this thing was made in 1998, not 1956!",1165536000,4,1859,4.392441860465116

This DVD contains a censored version of the original VHS program along with 8 matches. Six of those matches originate from RAW, which I like. These are, I believe, first time DVD releases for these RAW matches.

This DVD focuses heavily on the early incarnation of DX with HBK and HHH along with Chyna and some appearances by Rick Rude as the ""insurance policy"". It's kind of funny seeing these wrestlers from the late 90's acting ""badass"" and then sporting them fanny packs.",1282953600,3,716,4.766129032258065
2679544,3,B000JVRFXA,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven't seen the VCR version of this DVD. But I'd like to, after hearing that the documentary is much better then the one on here.

I am a huge DX fan - both of the reformation and of the original. I have both this DVD and the New & Improved DX, and I enjoy them both.

This is a re-release of the original DX tape released in 1998. All the WWF mentions and logos are blurred out. This annoys people, but I just ignore it. They don't mention the word 'WWF' that often, and I can oversee the blurring.

The documentary portion of this DVD is a bit bizarre in my opinion. It runs just under an hour and is from the time after Shawn Michaels was out with his back injury. The premise of the DVD follows Triple H wanting to make a documentary on DX and forcing Michael Cole to help him. The bits where Triple H and Chyna rough up Cole and threaten him are pretty funny. I liked the bit when the phone rung and it was Shawn, and Triple H hung up on him, it was just funny.

The documentary follows the formation of DX, and has individual sections on Triple H, Shawn and Chyna. Michael Cole narrates the documentary and there's lots of classic DX moments. The skit where Triple H & Shawn have to talk about what things they're not allowed to say on TV is ruined by bleeping however, but the segments where DX invade WCW and the CNN headquarters are amusing - there's even some footage that wasn't shown on TV.

The documentary is subpar though and could have gone a lot deeper in showing us about DX and their antics. I did like it for what it was, though.

The matches, however are what makes this DVD worth buying. Six of the matches are from Raw and are probably unavailable anywhere else. The other two are from the Royal Rumble 98 and No Way Out 98. Here's my rundown of the matches:

Shawn Michaels vs Mankind
This match is from Raw, and is similar to other HBK/Foley matches. It's still quite good though, and features an appearance from Rick Rude as Shawn's insurance policy. This match, to me, also hints at the formation of DX as Triple H & Chyna are also at ringside.

Shawn Michaels & Triple H vs The Undertaker & Mankind
This was the first time ever that HBK & HHH teamed up. Both teams were teasing that they couldn't trust each other, and Undertaker wanted Shawn in the ring, but Shawn kept avoiding him. The match ended in a DQ though, and Taker got beaten up afterwards.

Triple H vs Bret Hart
This match was just average on the wrestling side, but ringside antics were amusing as Shawn came down to ringside and decided to mock Bret Hart and Canada by shoving the Canadian flag up his nose - it was seriously funny. There was also an appearance from Owen Hart, the British Bulldog and Jim Neidhart.

European Title Match: Shawn Michaels vs Triple H
This wasn't really a match, more of a segment, but I found it very funny. This is Shawn & Hunter at their funniest. They were forced by Sgt Slaughter to participate in a match against each other for Shawn's European title, but they made a mockery out of it and didn't even wrestle. I loved it when Shawn just falls on the floor and Hunter runs the ropes for a full minute, then just pins him. The aftermath is hilarious when Shawn pretends to cry and Chyna has to comfort him. And I laughed out loud when Hunter said ""This is the best moment of my life, apart from my kid being born.. well I don't have one"" xD A very funny segment that you should check out.

Shawn Michaels vs Owen Hart
I liked this match because I didn't get to see many Owen Hart matches, as he passed away before I started watching wrestling. He impressed me and this was a good match. It ends in a DX beatdown on Owen.

WWF Championship Casket Match: Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker
This match is pretty good, but it's edited! They edited out the ending, which makes no sense at all to me. Why would you include a match and then take out the END? But up till then, I liked this match greatly. It's from the 98 Royal Rumble, and features some fantastic moments. I especially liked the bits when either Shawn or Taker would get shoved into the casket and we'd see a camera view from inside. The match descended into chaos when about five people came in and began beating up Taker, which brought out Kane to help him. The match ends after Kane clears the ring, not showing us the ending.

Non-sanctioned tag team match: Triple H, Road Dogg, Billy Gunn & Savio Vega vs Stone Cold Steve Austin, Cactus Jack, Chainsaw Charlie & Owen Hart
This is easily my favourite match here. Why? Because it's absolutely chaotic! For the first ten minutes of the match, it's pandenomium where everybody just beats each other up with weapons! The ref tries to get control but it's hopeless. The action mostly focuses on Stone Cold, but everybody gets a look in (this was my first time seeing Savio Vega). Finally the ref gets control, and the match settles into tag team action. Triple H's team mostly beats up on Cactus Jack & Chainsaw Charlie until Stone Cold gets the tag and goes mental on everyone, scoring the pin. Afterwards, Chyna gets in Stone Cold's face and then Stone Cold stuns her! A great hardcore match with a great aftermath.

European Title Match: Triple H vs Owen Hart
Again, not really a match. This is just Triple H coming down to ringside and yelling at Owen to put his title on the line (Owen is on commentary and has a broken ankle). Owen accepts the challenge, but his ankle stops him and Triple H puts him in a submission hold and the ref stops the match and awards the title to Triple H.

Overall, this is worth it for the matches, as some of them are rare. The non-sanctioned match is the best here and is very fun to watch. I also liked the casket match but I wish they hadn't edited out the ending! 3 stars.",1275091200,2,5788,4.326568265682657
