8340890,5,B001T9O688,"This is a must see for anyone who cares about their own and/or their families' health.  Even those who believe they are avoiding fluoride will consume fluoride via food and beverages bought in supermarkets and served in restaurants.

Fluoride like all drugs has side effects and should be avoided by many.

Science does not support fluoridation (the addition of fluoride chemicals into public water supplies); but rich and powerful special interest groups do.

Take back your water supplies from the special interest groups and demand your water suppliers stop adding unnecessary, health-robbing fluoride.  This DVD will tell you why you should avoid fluoride from respected professionals who have studied the emerging science  for many years

If fluoride health effects don't bother  you, know that millions of dollars are wasted in every state on fluoridation, every year. (New York City spent $24 million in 2008, alone)

8340891,5,B001T9O688,"The Video ""Professional Perspective on Water Fluoridation"" has made a huge impression on lay people who have watched it.  Scientists, dentists and doctors in the video have tried to speak in terms that inform without overloading with science that the average person can't follow. For professionals as well, who want to know more about the problem of artificial flouride in the drinking water, this is probably  the very best introduction out there. From the beginning to the end the DVD engages the attention and satisfies the curiosity, at the same time stimulating the desire to know more.",1242259200,9,591,5.082474226804123
8340892,5,B001T9O688,"This presentation has been invaluable in my community to explain to citizens and political leaders the reasons why adding fluoride in drinking water is unwarranted and dangerous to health. The medical and scientific professionals are impressive and concise with very easily understood statements. The local public television station has broadcast  it on a repeating basis, thereby informing much of the community of the truth about fluoridation. Because dentists and others promoting fluoridation generally have considerable community respect, it is important to counter those arguments with experts such as those on this DVD.",1241049600,27,626,5.804347826086956
