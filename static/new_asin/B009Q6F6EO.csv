5360957,5,B009Q6F6EO,I love the game. Love the anime. I watched in Hulu and I was static when it finally came out in blue ray. Great characters. Intriguing story. Pure Japanese teen mystery drama. The Persona series in games by Atlus has a huge cult following. Very happy customer.,1407283200,,260,4.553191489361702

5360959,5,B009Q6F6EO,"Finally finished season 2 I must say This anime is great not only because it follows the game but because the protagonist actually is a character and is not silent as he is in the game, he makes jokes and is ""kind of a jerk"" haha. Great buy I definitely recommend it to any persona or anime fan!",1405036800,,295,4.103448275862069
5360960,4,B009Q6F6EO,"We purchased this for my son on Christmas. Now he's got the whole family watching it! Unique storyline, interesting characters!",1401321600,,127,5.4
5360961,5,B009Q6F6EO,Great animated series even if you haven't played the game. Great character cast with an interesting story. This is definitely a must watch for anime fans.,1395792000,,154,4.961538461538462
5360962,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I'm very glad I picked up this series and watched it AFTER I had finished the game. It still has the great epic feel the game did with it's own added nuances that still make it unique enough to enjoy the story over again.

I have 2 complaints though:
1. Selling the series separately in two parts is a but silly, clearly a cash grab since buying one part without the other makes no sense.
2. Chie hardly ate any meat! This girl is a total carnivore in the game but they barely touch on it in the show, such a shame.

Definitely give this a watch though AFTER you've played and enjoyed the game, it's definitely worth it.",1395273600,,620,4.201680672268908
5360963,5,B009Q6F6EO,"If you are a fan of the Original Persona 4 for playstation, then you will love this series, it provides everything that game gives, while in a great sense of personality for the hero and also a great sense of humor. It is short, only 26 episodes, but they are worth the watch.",1393113600,,276,4.226415094339623
5360964,1,B009Q6F6EO,Because I did not get this anime when I want and did not get my money back either. I was planning to get it sent back but nothing happen yet,1391904000,,140,3.7
5360965,5,B009Q6F6EO,Very faithful adaptation! Totally worth the buy! I only wish they would make a version that included all of the added P4Golden story and characters!,1391385600,,148,4.96
5360966,5,B009Q6F6EO,"My son asked for this Blu Ray collection for Christmas. He is not a usual Anime fan, but he does like this series. It was a perfect gift for him.",1389052800,,145,3.8666666666666667
5360967,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I played my first Persona game on my Vita and absolutely loved it.  Best game on the Vita.  That game is part of a long-running video game series.  After finishing the game, I needed more Persona so I found this series on Amazon.  It follows the game, Persona 4 Golden, to a large degree but the story line is more developed.  It is episodic as I believe it was an anime series in Japan but I'm not sure of that. It's great, I'm really enjoying it.",1388188800,,448,4.162790697674419
5360968,5,B009Q6F6EO,"Wither you played persona 4 or persona 3 first or just got into this anime, you will not be disappointed (Hint that the 360 version of Persona 4 is lame compare to the ps2 game).

In the anime they follow the game story line but they show a little more to what your character (ironically named Yu) does and how he feels about the ordeal he is facing. You also get a deeper connection with your friends and understand them a little better. To be honest, I love that I can play the game than watch the anime to see the finer details. However, I didn't like the last episode because it just felt lazy and far from the game.",1386460800,,620,4.166666666666667
5360969,5,B009Q6F6EO,"It shipped in perfect condition, anybody who loves Shin Megami Tensei: Persona should by this!
It might not be as detailed of a story as the game but it has a lot of funny bits and it makes you fall in love with the characters even more.",1385337600,,237,4.0638297872340425
5360970,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I love persona alot and this has a really funny episode on it ( King's game) i enjoyed all the game voice actors also being present, loved it highly recommended.",1383523200,,161,4.4
5360971,4,B009Q6F6EO,"While I really like the show, it suffers from being a condensed version of the game.  The pacing suffers particularly in the second half, having kind of awful mood swings like going from Nanako and Dojima's combined social link to the school festival.  The show is still good, and I imagine a lot of the mood swings aren't intentional, but it's still there and it's still kind of sad.",1381276800,,384,4.550724637681159
5360972,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I played the crap out of Persona 4 Golden and didn't start to get tired of it until after my third straight play-through.  So when I learned there was an anime, I just had to have it.  The characters definitely live up to what I had come to expect of them in the game.  My only disappointment came from the absence of Marie, to whom I had grown attached from P4G, but since she doesn't appear in the original title for the PS2 it's an acceptable difference.",1379721600,,457,4.2298850574712645

5360974,4,B009Q6F6EO,"The only reason I gave the blu-ray discs a 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is the English track only, otherwise this is a beautifully packaged, excellent and enjoyable series.  The voice actors you hear in even the dubbed version are for the most the same actors and actresses who did the roles in the video game so if you are a fan of the game you will easily recognize them.  As I said this series is excellent and a must have for fans of the series. I will admit I despise watching any anime dubbed with the exception of a few because the voice action usually stinks but I must admit after purchasing this I can safely say there are now 4 series I enjoy watching dubbed.",1376006400,,676,4.1923076923076925

As they piece the puzzle together they are forced to face Shadows of their inner selves built out of the thing they hide from the world, or from their deepest fears. One wrong step and they'll find themselves off the air for good.

A deep ride into what makes a person tick, and how many things we all struggle with in our lives. I highly recommend this anime to anyone that wants a full story, action, and a decent side of comedy.",1367107200,,662,4.382113821138211

Done! Buy! Be Happy!",1366329600,,180,4.0
5360982,5,B009Q6F6EO,This anime is a perfect distillation/adaptation of the original game. The main character has their own personality now and it helps tie the story together in a way that adds to the original story rather than being just a duplication.,1365206400,,233,4.85

5360984,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I first came upon Persona 4 Collection 1, at one of my retail shops I go too.  I've played the PlayStation 2 game and loved the game layout and story.  Based from the game itself, it followed the game exactly to its cut scene, music, and style.  Persona 4 Collection 2, is the continuation of the 1st 13 episode collection, which finished off the story where some of the game hadn't have in the story cut sequences.  If you love anime, a good story, and some mystery, this might be up your alley.",1364860800,,496,4.301075268817204

5360986,5,B009Q6F6EO,"It's more or less the story from the game, just you don't have the control over the decisions anymore. Still a great story and strong cast. English voices are fine if you are used to the games english voices.",1363305600,,208,4.358974358974359
5360987,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I love the story, and the continuation is almost necessary to fulfill the complete story. The cast is the same, for the most part. I loved it, and fans of Persona 4 need this for their collection. Get it now, before it is out of site and goes up to a few hundred bucks like most Atlus products.",1362787200,,294,4.086206896551724
5360988,5,B009Q6F6EO,The anime lives up to my expectations and it stays true to the original plot line but adds some twists to keep it fresh.,1362182400,,120,4.041666666666667
5360989,4,B009Q6F6EO,"I stand by all things I said in regards to collection 1

in this volume there are some specific examples in which even I, someone who enjoys english dubs, found to be just wrong. When Yu and the gang spend the night at Yukiko's Inn there is a moment in which Nanako calls Yu and Teddie perverts. In the japanese audio Yu screams persona while playing table tennis and teddie screams Kuma... Now I found that part to be hilarious in the original airing however listening to the voice actor unenthusiastically yell persona and ""Bear,"" really killed the moment. When listening to the show I found many moments where I would remember a hilarious part from the Japanese version and anxiously await to hear it done in english only to be let down.

Dont mistake me though, Johnny Yong Bosch did an amazing job as Yu and I really do associate him with that character but if I had to nitpick at one thing about all the voice actors, its that sometimes, very rarely, they just don't match the level of passion the originals displayed for example the cool level headed voice of Yu that Daisuke Namikawa provides. Even the king game scene just wasn't as impactful as the time I watched it during the original airing...

Note, these are all minor complaints for someone who hasn't already watched or played the game however for those of you who have seen the story before it may leave you with something to desire.

Overall Persona 4: the Animation is an amazing story that first time viewers will really get a kick out of, for those who have seen it you may become irritated with the small things here and there, things that dual audio and subtitles would fix, however because they are not available on the Blu ray collection and only on the DVD it may be more wise to skip the High Definition for a more catered product, but don't let any of that stop you from owning some form of this amazing series.",1362096000,,1890,4.4854651162790695
5360990,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I love all the persona games, i want want want there to be a persona 5 for ps3, and more anime!! mooooore!! rawr!!!",1362009600,,115,4.043478260869565
5360991,5,B009Q6F6EO,"Not only does this DVD have the English and Japanese track, the show itself was very true to the game. Persona 4 is one of the greatest games I have ever played, and to see it adapted so well is very pleasing. I also enjoyed the extra story content that did not occur within the game.",1361145600,,284,4.089285714285714
5360992,5,B009Q6F6EO,Awesome series from beginning to end. Story line is really deep and the characters are easy to connect to. A definite must have.,1361145600,,128,4.608695652173913
5360993,4,B009Q6F6EO,"First off I was a massive fan of the PS2 game and have sunk untold hours into that game. This is the 2nd half of the series and it keeps relatively inline with the story of the game. Of course cramming an 80 hour game into 26 episodes is a tall order. This release keeps with semi-slap stick, but as the series went on some of the new voice actors (those not present in the game) really started to annoy me.  One such case is Adachi, his voice makes makes me want to rip off my ears during his longer rants in the later episodes. So just be aware that with the change in voice actors if you've gotten used to the vocal cadence from the game it can throw you off a bit.  This wasn't as big of a problem for the 1st collection, but it seems more apparent in this release. The story on the final disc gets pretty dense for a bit, but generally resolves before the end. I don't want to go into that much detail in case someone ends up seeing it for the first time. Despite the downsides the series really is enjoyable and represents the story very well.",1360972800,,1049,4.11219512195122
5360994,5,B009Q6F6EO,"It seems like the case is solved, a murder is arrested and the Investigative team works to enjoy golden week and summer vacation by going on trips.  But things are not all as it seems, Yu is running around on a mysterious mission - which has Naniko don the Magical Detective Loveline cape to solve the mystery, Teddy is popping up all over the place, and the Midnight Channel is quiet.  But when the Detective Prince starts going to the school with new questions, even Yu has suspicions that the case is far from solved.  As the group work to discover the secret of the Midnight channel, someone close to Yu is taken by the killer.  It is a race into the TV world to save the latest victims, but can the bonds and new Persona's that Yu controls be enough or will it be the ultimate cancellation as the Velvet Room prepares to close.

Overall I loved the series, you could hear slight differences in the characters voices from Part 1 to Part 2 but I did not think that it detracted from the story as a whole.  I would say that anyone who is a fan of the Persona Series will still enjoy this.",1360886400,2,1090,4.266990291262136
5360995,5,B009Q6F6EO,"i found this series to match up with the game well the later season wits nicely and overall a great series.
with action styles similar to bleach and digimon, and animation that in HD is to say the least... spectacular, and people that are developed and each unique to this series it was a great breath of fresh air to the normal cycle of anime reuse of character personality

if youve watched season 1 you won't be disappointed",1360540800,,427,4.4743589743589745
5360996,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I love this anime almost as much as I love the game Persona 4 Golden for PS vita! I really enjoyed the anime (Yu is funny through out the whole series ""Because I'm the King""). It is well done even though some of the voice actors are different from the game. I recommend anybody who likes english dubbed anime and or is a huge Persona 4 fan!! Buy it!!",1360195200,,350,4.086956521739131
5360997,5,B009Q6F6EO,"I'm a big fan of the game, but I liked this series a lot more than I expected. It has a lot of humor and some very nice animation. I wish they would do a version of Persona 3 like this.",1360108800,,185,3.5365853658536586
5360998,5,B009Q6F6EO,"Great collection of episodes to finish up the story.  The only downside is that it has to come to an end.  The characters are great, and for people who have not played the games there a few good twists.  If you have played the game, they liven the battles up just enough to make it feel fresh.  Definitely entertaining, with great voice acting for the dub.",1360022400,,356,4.348484848484849
5360999,5,B009Q6F6EO,"The ""Shin Megami Tensei: Persona"" role-playing video game series developed and published by Atlus and has won over fans due to its darker storyline and it's one of the few games to incorporate a Japanese atmosphere incorporating simulation type games relating to its characters.

Created back in 1996, ""Shin Megami Tensei: Persona"" has continually evolved and its fifth installment, ""Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 (the fifth installment in the SMT: Persona series) was no doubt a popular title in the series when it was released on the PlayStation 2 in 2008.

The video game would inspire a 25-episode anime series titled ""Persona 4: The Animation"" , which aired on Japanese television in 2011-2012.

In 2012, with the release of the PlayStation Vita version of the game (titled ""Persona 4: Golden"") and the fighting game sequel ""Persona 4 Arena"" for the PlayStation 3 and XBOX 360, what better time than now to release the anime series ""Persona 4: The Animation"" on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.

With the first volume of ""Persona 4: The Animation"" featuring the first 12-episodes released in September 2012, the second collection featuring 13-26 was released in January 2013.

VIDEO:

""Persona 4: The Animation"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio). The anime series is vibrant and colorful. The overall look of ""Persona 4 is stylish and cool, but it's interesting to see its use of pink with white on the faces of the characters. It's definitely a different use of coloring for characters but watching this anime series, color plays a big part in this series to set a mood. May it be the looming danger of the fog rolling into Inaba, the use of blues in the Blue Room but for the majority of the anime series, everything is colorful. Chie's red hair and green/yellow track jacket, Yukiko and Rise's use of red and of course the beautiful combination of animation and CG elements, for the most part, I felt the series compliments the video game remarkably well.

But overall anime production from AIC A.S.T.A. is fantastic, the series looks wonderful on Blu-ray with no banding or artifacts. The series looked sharp, black levels were nice and deep and colors were absolutely vibrant! ""Persona 4: The Animation"" looks awesome!

AUDIO:

""Persona 4: The Animation"" is presented only with an English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtrack. While the English version is well-acted, it is somewhat of a disappointment that the Japanese soundtrack is not included. The reason for this is that the Japanese licensors did not want reverse importation of the Blu-ray release, but yet the DVD will include both soundtracks. It's sad because the Japanese soundtracks utilize the same voice actors, which would have been nice to see. But the fear of reverse importation does happen and unfortunately some series are released in America without its Japanese soundtrack. Interesting enough, on the video game side of things, the recent U.S. release of ""Persona 4 Arena"" became the first video game to be region-locked for the PlayStation 3. One again, in fears of reverse importation.

With that being said, dialogue and music is crystal clear through the front channels. And when it comes to voice acting, Sentai Filmworks brought voice acting veterans to the series such as Johnny Yong Bosch, Amanda Winn Lee, Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey, Karen Strassman and more.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Persona 4: The Animation - Collection Two"" comes with the following special features:

  Clean Opening and Closing Animations
  Trailers - Trailers for Sentai Filmworks releases

JUDGMENT CALL:

If you thought the first half of ""Persona 4: The Animation"" was exciting, wait until you watch ""Persona 4: The Animation - Collection Two"".  More action, more exciting and even more emotional than the first half.  Definitely one of the best anime series created that is based on a video game!

I'm a big fan of the entire ""Shin Megami Tensei"" video game series. My first experience with a ""Shin Megami Tensei"" video game was ""Persona II: Eternal Punishment"" and I absolutely loved the game for its characters but also it's darker theme, use of Personas and it's use of Japanese pop culture ingrained into an RPG game, the video games were a distinct style compared to other games from the major software makers.

And things changed no doubt with ""Persona 3 which included a dating simulator and the ability for one to strengthen relationships, friendships and the overall gameplay becoming much more stylish and cool! Suffice to say, when ""Persona 4 came out, once again, Atlus was able to create cool characters and further the experience for fans and gamers (who love Japanese RPG's), but most importantly, making the games different from other companies and continuing to set the ""Shin Megami Tensei: Persona"" apart from its competitors.

And more American video game critics have started to take notice in the ""Shin Megami Tensei"" series. While many people who are discovering it are wondering, what is the appeal?

""Persona 4: The Animation"" is a series that captures the fun of the video game series but in animated format. It's one thing to have animated cut scenes but to have a series that compliments the video game is wonderful. Many people who have watched anime series based on video games, may it be ""Final Fantasy"", ""Xenogears"", ""Tekken"", ""Street Fighter"", ""King of Fighters"" will notice that the stories are much different than the video game. While there are series such as the "".Hack"" anime that does compliment the video games, it doesn't use the actual characters of the video game series completely. ""Persona 4: The Animation"" not only features the characters, but it also showcases the supporting characters and goes into things that make the video game series so fun such as one's ability to strengthen relationships and friendships.

Like the video game, the main protagonist Yu can make a difference in people's lives. From making a difference in the life of his cousin, young Nanako to also his relationship with his female friends...Chie, Yukiko and Rise. And like the video game, the series shows how Yu can easily heighten his relationship with these female characters if he focuses on it. The video game of course allows you to build these relationships, but the anime series showcases those relationships and what one can accomplish.

And then there is the Persona element. With most of the Persona games, there is always a character who has the special ability to use more than one Persona. The series uses Igor and Margaret from the Blue Room to start off each episode and shows how Yu has received a new Persona for strengthening his bonds with other people. This is important in the video game and it's great to see the series start off with the Blue Room and set the tone for the series, may it be to guide Yu or to warn him of major danger.

The second half of the series continues the action, but also the friendships that Yu and friends have.  But how these people function almost like a family.  But just when you think the serial-murder case was over, think again!

And what shocks the audience is when an unexpected tragedy hits close to home and a death you never expected.  Definitely makes the series more emotional but everything works itself out by the end of the series that you can't help but want to watch more ""Persona 4: The Animation"".  A lot of twists and turns with this second half but it was definitely worth watching!

Watching ""Persona 4: The Animation"" made me feel giddy like a fanboy. Why? Because I absolutely love the video games and to see it explored in such a way, like this anime series and getting it right, I don't know how many times I have watched an anime series inspired by a video game and felt disappointed because it seemed as if the writers of the anime series were not on the same page as those who developed the video games. But for ""Persona 4: the Animation"", the writers were in tune with what happens in the series and managed to incorporate those elements from the video game to this anime series.

The Blu-ray looks absolutely fantastic! Colorful, vibrant, the anime series looks fantastic on Blu-ray. As for the audio, I'm sure there are those who are going to be disappointed that the Japanese soundtrack was not included but once again, fears of reverse importation has happened before for an anime series on Blu-ray and in the case of ""Persona 4, it not only has affected this Blu-ray release but also the most recent release of the ""Persona 4 Arena""video game being region-locked.

Sure, the Blu-ray may not have both soundtracks (while the DVD does) but if you do enjoy English dubs, the good news is that Sentai Filmworks brought in their veterans for ""Persona 4: The Animation"". From Amanda Winn Lee, Johnny Yong Bosch, Yuri Lowenthall, Karen Strassman, Laura Bailey to name a few, I'm quite pleased with the English dub. As for special features, you get the usual clean opening and ending animations but also both director's cut and on air versions of the first episode.

If you thought the first half of ""Persona 4: The Animation"" was exciting, wait until you watch ""Persona 4: The Animation - Collection Two"".  More action, more exciting battles and even more emotional than the first half of the series.  Definitely one of the better anime series that is based on a video game!  Recommended for fans of the ""Shin Megami Tensei"" video games and anime fans wanting something different for an action anime series but also something unique, stylish, cool!

Despite the crazy pace that it takes in order to cram the 100 hour game into 26 episodes, I really enjoyed the characterization of Yu and how the social links were handled. Most important of all, though, was the return of the original voice cast - aside from the replacing of Chie and Teddie (which carried forward into Persona 4 Arena and Persona 4 Golden, so at least they don't stand out), the original voices are crucial to the characters. I assumed the same cast would be around for this volume, but the voices of Kanji and Naoto have both been replaced. It's really distracting ruins all their scenes.

That inconsistency makes it much harder for me to accept the other things that bother me about this adaptation, primarily the removal of the Japanese honorifics from dialogue. The original game throws around -chans, -kuns, and senpais constantly, and that goes a long way towards making it feel more authentically Japanese. The absence of that here is really jarring, and really compounds the problems with the voices. Characters don't sound like they should sound and don't talk like they should talk, and the whole thing doesn't feel like Persona 4 anymore.

I was interested in this anime as an abridged way to experience the story of Persona 4 without putting in the massive time investment to replay the game. But losing those voice actors is huge, and the changes to the dialogue rarely make it better. There's stuff to like about Persona 4: the Animation, but overall it's not worth it.",1358208000,6,1593,4.706093189964157

5361002,5,B009Q6F6EO,"Finally, the second half to the great Persona 4 anime adaption is upon us. This Blu-ray set is only English Dubbed and has the second half of the series, while also containing the special True End episode.

The second half of the series is where I think this show shines the most. Hilarious Social Link episodes and high stakes fights are common in this half of the series. I always recommend that if you are interested in the show to try and play the game first, as the show obviously runs through it, which can ruin the game experience if you haven't already played it.

This set includes a special True End episode that is alternative to the ending of the episode before it. This special is actually worse than the normal ending though. This adaption of the True End from the game (which the True End in the game is absolutely fantastic and way better than the normal ending) is sloppy. They go for some kind of cutting maneuver which means they go from once scene to another and then back a earlier scene again constantly. It is quite nauseating to me, as it should have just been presented in the typical linear format, but the people directing it probably did it this way to cut down on the time of the special. Overall, this True End left me dissatisfied and I would actually recommend almost ignoring it.

Despite that, everything else is here. The very emotional scenes with Nanako, the heavy fighting climax against the true culprit, it is all here. Persona 4 is my favorite video game of all time, so this Anime does mean a lot to me, and I think they really did a good job with this adaption (well... besides the True End special). If you beat the game, or don't plan to ever play it, then I hope you give this Anime a shot!",1354665600,17,1736,4.401869158878505

As for a quick review of the show:
----
It's not bad,
it's not a replacement for playing the game, but it's a pretty decent recap.
The pacing can get a little poor at times, and the fights can be a little lackluster, But the focus is where it should be, on the STORY!
Overall, it's a fun look back at the plot of P4.",1515110400,,762,4.547445255474453
