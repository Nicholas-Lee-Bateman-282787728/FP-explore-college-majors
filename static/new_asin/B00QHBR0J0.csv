6867763,5,B00QHBR0J0,"When I first got this DVD set, I thought it was for kids, I was expecting to teach my newphs how to read using this as a review. I not only loved it for young kids, but I feel older children in general could benifit from the learning.

This DVD set takes kids thorugh a real learning journey. Starting with phonics and taking your child on a super educational journey, this DVD set is a great way to enhance your child curriculum.

Some key features I like, all of the phonics are presented in a clear articulate manner. They are very easy for the kids to haer and repeat. Some of the skills have moths next to the word so the kids can really see oral formation. After introducing a new skill through images, text and songs, they then have a fun quize with nice beats playing in the background. Such a fun way for kids to relax and review what they have learned.

Overall, this DVD set is amazing. The perfect way for kids to review their work while vegging out. Since this set contains 10 DVD's your child will have all they need to read sucessfully. A good reading foundation is very importnat and Rock and Learn has set up an amazing program.

I received this DVD set in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are mine and were in no way influenced by outside sources. I am a professional blogger at Little Lady Plays",1446076800,2,1325,4.330645161290323

The customer service representatives were incredibly prompt in troubleshooting the problem with me.  Ultimately, the situation resulted in them sending me an entirely new set that works perfectly in my car.  Thank you SO MUCH to the staff at Rock'n'Learn.  It is obvious that they truly care about the children and parents they serve.",1531612800,,434,4.986111111111111

8691282,5,B00QHBR0J0,"This is an outstanding resource for learning to read.

It is comprehensive - if it needs to be addressed with a beginning reader, it is covered in this DVD set.

It is engaging. TERRIBLY engaging. The content is presented in such a way that it not only captures a child's attention and holds it, but is also entertaining enough that children will be willing to watch the DVDs over and over. That's a good thing for reinforcement, and because the truth is, reading English is a terribly complex set of skills. The more often children revisit the pertinent information, and the more willing they are to do so, the better it will be seated in their minds.

It is flexible. This set could be used by a homeschooling family to cover all introduction to reading skills. It can be used as a supplement to any basic reading program. I think this set would be particularly valuable to a child in a traditional school setting who needs a little extra help. Watching these DVDs would *not* feel like work, or home work, or any kid of ""help."" It will just feel fun. And the DVDs could very well run int he ""background"" while a child engages in other (quiet) behaviors, such as building with Legos. The content on the DVDs ""gets under your skin,"" and you really can't help but review it over and over in your mind (even the grown-ups!). For a child who might struggle with being still and need to keep his/her hands busy, this would be a wonderful way to ""study"" without studying.

I received a review set of these DVDs for testing purposes. Any opinion expressed is mine alone.",1468281600,4,1565,4.519434628975265
8691283,5,B00QHBR0J0,"I am always looking for entertaining by educational games, dvds, toys you name it. If it can be fun and entertaining I'm all for it. I have a few baby DVDs but nothing for my school age children. During the summer I stress to print worksheets or make them read. But let's face it, I'm not a teacher and I cannot MAKE them read. I catch my daughter flipping through the pages because she hates to read. She is going to third grade but the teachers feel she reads on a lower level. So when I was able to review this set I was super excited.
There are 10 DVDs all together and I started with the first but that wasn't happening with my kids.  I thought it was very cute and the characters are great. It's entertaining and the music is catching. But since the first disc is basics, they fussed that they ""knew everything"" on the DVD and it was ""boring"" so I moved along to the third. The third kept them very engaged. I could hear them trying to answer the quiz questions and participating with the characters.
Each DVD is roughly an hour so it is not stretching the attentions span. I can't wait for my one year old to start benefiting from this set. She will have the foundation needed to become an amazing reader before she goes to school. As far my other children, they can go back to school stronger readers and hopefully have the boosted confidence needed to excel in their grade.

8691284,5,B00QHBR0J0,"We're loving these DVDs. I have a 3 year old and a 5 year old as of last week. We're working on preparation for kindergarten through the summer, so this couldn't have come at a better time. So far, we have watched the entire first disk and my little guy keeps asking for another.

Likes
+ during pronunciation of sounds a mouth is visible to show should formation
+ each DVD is broken into small sections that can be repeated for memory
+ many different ""games"" for the different concepts
+ kept my kiddo's attention
+ huge collection to cover many areas
+ lots of repetition and good rhythm to promote memory

Dislikes
- the first disk started out a little more advanced than I would have thought.

We watched the first DVD in the set during a car ride. Being the first in the set of a learning to read program, I was surprised at how advanced it was,  but what I did like about it is that it is broken down into sections and different games, so that we could take a few moments to watch a section or two and, after some repetition, help the kiddos learn the concepts. It also helps from losing the kiddos' attention or getting discouraged during difficult concepts.

My favorite part of the DVD is the beginning of the first DVD, it goes through each letter sound while displaying the letter, an image of something that begins with that sound, and a mouth to watch the shape while it makes the sound. Its really smart! A huge part of learning letter sounds is mouth shape and tongue placement and this really helps with that. The rhythm was also really good and my little guy was saying them all right along with the DVD.

The kids are very excited to continue through this collection this summer. I love that they stay entertained with the characters, songs, colors, and games while learning important concepts for reading.

We received this product for testing purposes. We were asked to be honest in our review - good or bad - to help future buyers. We have no affiliation with the company, did not receive compensation, and all opinions come from our own experience with the product.",1467763200,2,2089,4.496042216358839
8691285,5,B00QHBR0J0,"My daughter is 4. She's currently working on preparing herself for Kindergarten. She's begun using this 10-DVD set to help her learn her site words so she can learn to read. Right now she's working on the phonics DVD. What I like about this DVD is hearing her running around the house pronouncing words. She walks around the house annunciating each consonant. She did not do this before starting on this DVD collection. It truly means a lot to me that she can watch the DVD and be entertained but at the end of the day, the goal is to learn. I can see her applying the lessons already. My daughter would like you to know that her favorite part is the songs that they sing.

We've not made it through the entire series yet. We are going slowly to make sure she fully learns and understands each lesson. She watches the DVD once a day and we don't move along to the next DVD until she says she's ready and exhibits and understanding of the DVD she's watched. She's young enough that she frequently watches the same TV shows over and over without becoming bored. I prefer this method than watching each DVD once. Once we've completed the series I will come back and update my reviews on the effectiveness of the entire series.

Overall rating: 25 out of 25 stars / 5 Star Average

 SUMMARY: My daughter enjoys this DVD series but more importantly she's already exhibiting and understanding of the lessons she's watched. While I enjoy that the series entertains her it means more to me that she's understanding the lessons. I would recommend this series. I will update my review when we've completed the series to let you know how effective it was at teaching her to read.
