8008807,5,B00019GI38,My husband drives trucks as part of a team so 40 movies should keep him entertained for the time that he is resting in the sleeper cab and the other guy drives. I've gotten several of these high volume movie sets for him and he loves them. And decent quality too!  I love Amazon!,1373414400,,279,4.166666666666667

8008809,4,B00019GI38,"Besides the standard public domain oaters most of these budget-priced box sets offer, THE GREAT AMERICAN WESTERN Vol. 11-20 also contains three documentaries, plus samplings of two long-forgotten TV series. CADE'S COUNTY starred Glenn Ford in the very last gasp of the big-budget TV western. Despite scripts fraught with social relevance and a who-who guest star roster, this well-intentioned program ran for only 24 episodes before it bit the dust.

Speaking of dust-- the other TV series represented here, DUSTY'S TRAILS, was a western/comedy hybrid featuring Bob Denver (late of Gilligan's Island). THE WACKIEST WAGON TRAIN IN THE WEST is comprised of three episodes of that prairie schooner-shipwreck of a show.

As for the rest of the movies here-- just darn good stuff with dozens of well-known actors. This is a terrific collection at a bargain price that's hard to resist!

It's what good-old cowboy movies are all about!
