When the twin towers collapse,
We speak in one voice,
When the fire is burning, we become one faith,
When firemen and policemen are hurt, we share one blood,
When people are killed, we become one family,
When the rescue operation is going on, we say a prayer

Let us stand and hold hands together to honor and remember the victims on the day of infamy 9/11
We are hit but still alive
We are wounded but not defeated
Our twin towers fell and we bleed
We will get up quickly and ready to fight again
The eagle is high, strong and free from the fire and ashes
We will unite in diversity, Justice will prevail!

May God bless the United States of America.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-All-Enemies-Inside-America-s-War-on-Terror/dp/0743260457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror</a>",1315699200,4,1674,5.478599221789883
