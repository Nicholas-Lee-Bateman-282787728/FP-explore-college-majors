4109323,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"This was an excellent insight into a world dependant on oil.
Peak oil is not a myth and never was, first predicted by M. King Hubbert (October 5, 1903 - October 11, 1989), who originally predicted in the 1950's that America would peak in the 1970's and took another 10 years after for the reality to hit home after years of ridicule by those in denial. Hubbert also predicted global peak oil at about now!

Michael Ruppert clearly lays out the reality of our 'carbon based energy dependant western world' and the dire consequences that until now virtually no-one has given much thought too but we will all have to confront.
Michael explores the hidden costs that will affect all our lives and the ramifications which given the nature of humans will not be pretty.
This is a wake up call like no other.
Michael is giving us a road map, things to look for that mainstream media will not investigate.
Avoid this movie at your peril, an ignorant public is a dangerous public. This is a MUST see for anyone.

This movie is like a good book once you start you can't put it down, it will make you think seriously.  Watch with your friends and their families, Tiger Woods, John Terry and big breasted women will no longer distract the harsh truths we all face...you can only prepare if you know what's coming!
If you have family and care for them watch this emotional and thought provoking movie and start planning your families future, while there is still time.",1272672000,6,1455,4.567049808429119
4109324,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"I watched this movie and it is a very good synopsis of events around us that have been happening for the last 5 years.  Each day we see more evidence of collapse throughout the world.

About 2 years I saw some headline stories about a subject I do not want to get into, that lead me to the work of Michael Ruppert.  I read all the information on his From the wilderness website and the  from the wilderness blog, then his ""Crossing the Rubicon"" book, and finally his ""A Presidential Energy Policy"".  After digesting this information with a few other authors like Daniel Estulin and William F. Engdahl, I came to the conclusion that Mr. Ruppert has a better grasp on an apex issue than most others.  I respect his work and feel it is critical to understanding our current World climate and situation.

This Movie is a great eye opener for everyone.  When I showed it to my wife it finally clicked with her about why governments were doing what they were doing and how Peak Oil and resources would affect our lives and everyone around us as time marches on.  It is a very affective tool for people new to the idea of Peak Oil or for people who need that little push to just wake up and realize something isn't quite right any more.

I recommend this movie for any and everyone to see and digest.  Then I would suggest go and get the Collapse book, which, when I bought it, realized it was a recovered ""A Presidential Energy Policy"" book.  It contains more in depth, critical information beyond the overview presented in the movie.

Thank you  Mr. Ruppert for giving up what you have to bring us this information.",1272585600,6,1610,4.450511945392491

With many years of police investigative work under his belt, Ruppert is simply brilliant at paying attention and putting all the pieces together in Global Economics. This is a must see film that will have your jaw dropping and your brain in gear to go to action.  It will change the way you look at history, current events, and the future. It's not scare tactics and doomsaying. It's a plea to understand what has been going on and what the world is leading to.  It's a plea to prepare.",1272585600,4,525,4.447916666666667

Energy, Economy, Government, War, Food, all of it ties together and Michael Ruppert explains it with a punch-in-your-gut force that should have every person on the planet sitting up and paying attention.

4109329,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"This movie creates a new genre in film: ""the economic horror flick""

Only sombody with the street cred of a Mike Rupert could create such a masterpiece movie
that tells the true stort about how banksters wave looted this world and set up 6 billion of us
to take the fall when we run out of oil and in turn food.

This film made me redouble my efforts to move to a rural location learn how to grow most of my own food
withot a drop of oil raise livestock and convert my wealth into wind, solar, and wood power.

I'm a wall street economist for a living 31 years now and can tell you this movie is spot on what will happen to america soon

It fueled my fear to prepare my life now while collapse planning is still possible.

If it does not scare the bejesus out of you, check your pulse.

Collapse is comming and survivial favors the prepared mind.

4109331,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"Very disturbing movie. It may give you nightmares worse than any horror film you have ever seen.
 What makes it so scary is that Ruppert is correct in his statements. As he says, ""I don't deal in conspiracy theory, I deal in conspiracy fact"". It is an important wake up call for society.
On the down side, I do think that he takes his message a little too far, implying that society is actually descending into collapse right now, and that there will be all out anarchy at any second.
He though the mortgage meltdown and financial crisis going on in 2009 was the beginning of the end. Well, the economy has rebounded and society has not yet collapsed. I also think that he does not give enough credit to technological advances and the human race's incredible ability to adapt. Can the earth sustain 7 billion (or more!) humans into perpetuity? Absolutely not. We have reached Peak Oil and need to figure out how to survive without our addiction to oil.",1464307200,5,952,4.567251461988304

The most fascinating element of this documentary for me, was watching his facial expressions and body language, the calculation in his eyes and the defiance of his jutting chin suggested uncertainty. I love that he answered a question by describing just how intelligent he believed himself to be, and was then brought back to the original question... he actually smiled the 'Liar's Delight' before squinting his eyes in distrust at the redirect.

4109357,1,B003CJXJ8Q,"Michael Ruppert, the star of this film, begins by using his family and his credentials, in which he leaves out all the prophecies he's made which never panned out.  Google it, this guy has the hit record of a common psychic.  Never mind that his credentials have nothing to do with the evidence presented.  This is a common logical fallacy, appeal to authority which he uses time and time again, used by intellectually inhibited people to posture themselves in the eyes of other people, in this case the viewer.

So what evidence should I discuss?  How about nothing.  Michael basically tries to explain how the whole world works (in his mind).  He knows a lot of historical facts which he throws out there, for example like names, dates, or congressional hearings.  The filmmakers prop up his credentials by cutting to clips from YouTube and his newsletter in which he ""broke"" all these stories like Pat Tillman and the 2008 Financial Crisis, but... they fail to note the larger portion of his predictions which were completely wrong.  And I'm not acknowledging that he should get the credit for the stuff he references.  There were a lot of people crying foul about sub-prime mortgages.

Michael even quotes a line from the Denzel movie Crimson Tide like he's actually read Carl von Clausewitz... I think he's just really good at the social side of the human mind, mainly knowing how to manipulate people into believing whatever he says by throwing a fog of data and then hitting them with the punchline.

He has no real understanding of economics or global finance, among other topics.  He seems to think that explaining how money is abstract is somehow a shock.  Sorry Mike, not to anyone who has ever had a reason to think about it.  Nations are abstract.  There are no lines between nations, they only exist in the minds of living people.  Maps are symbolic of our shared beliefs about the world we live in.  The same is true for the value of money.  It has value because we believe it does.  He acts like the switch from precious-metal backed money to cash and electronic is somehow bad.  I don't get it.  Gold or silver is also abstract. It only has value as jewelry (or high end electronics) and its relative rareness made it convenient to carry (small weight, large value) for an abstract means of trade.  The switch from gold-backed money was essential because : A. It's abstract, it doesn't theoretically matter what form of currency is used as long as it's understood to have the values to which we assign it. And B. There is a limited amount of gold in the world.  Complete and utter foolishness to use gold as an abstract currency when it could easily run out!  Of course we'd switch to more abundant sources like paper, copper, zinc, nickel and now electrons.

His understanding of economics can be further debunked with the basic tenet of supply and demand.  First, he is completely mistaken in that all of the oil in the world has been found.  First, he says that oil production is declining.  Not true it has been steadily rising, decade over decade, since forever.  Second, he says that no amount ingenuity or technological advancement can help us?  Wrong.  Demand breeds innovation, at least in competitive, capitalist economies.  When oil hit $150 a barrel, the profit margins allowed for more expensive extraction techniques, and business being businesses became more innovative and efficient.  This drove costs down even more.  Fracking, horizontal wells, drilling rigs which are faster, safer, use less manpower, and dig deeper were developed in this country within the last decade and made the United States one of the top oil producers in the world in less than a decade.  These technologies were also developed in refining techniques making previously cost-prohibitive resources available due to high demand.

There is oil everywhere.  Africa has vast untapped reserves, as well as Central Asia, Siberia, South America, Mexico, Canada, the United States, Australia, the world's oceans, etc... When the actual reserves of the world become more depleted (a century of more from now), assuming capitalism still reigns supreme, companies will develop synthetic hydrocarbons because the costs of doing this will be cheaper than the costs of extracting and refining crude oil from the earth's crust.  It's literally Econ 101, Adam Smith, basic supply and demand.

Next he goes on a tirade against modern agriculture.  Once again, utter ignorance wrapped up in a vice that is Mike's know-it-all ego.  The word ""chemical"" is often used by the ignorant as a bad word.  It is simply a purified substance like drinking water for example.  It's all protons, electrons, and neutrons, ok?  So whether you're peeing on your yard, he seriously says he does this, or spreading fertilizers, you're spreading the same matter but in different forms.  He acts like the world of agriculture was pure or something before modern techniques.  Well, I'll point to the Levant and Egypt, known in its heyday as the breadbasket of Rome, where over-farming by peoples wholly ignorant of science systematically destroyed their soils through agriculture.  I served in Iraq.  You can still see ancient canals in parts of the country but the only thing that grows are shrubs and some weeds here and there.  There is no grass, because wheat is a grass and all the nutrients grasses need were extracted and never replaced.  The only farming I saw in Iraq was along the rivers or working canals where nutrient rich silts can replenish fields through natural or controlled flooding.

That being said, the most efficient way to replace these nutrients is through crop rotation, laying fallow, and fertilizers.  And now we can add genetic engineering to our  bag of tricks.  This enables us to use less labor and less resources to produce larger yields from less land.  All good things which follow basic supply and demand.

Agriculture is not separate from nature.  We as humans are creating habitats of our own devising, but natural selection is constantly acting on them to take advantage of these environments we've created.  Larger animals and trees are being selected against, while insects, bacteria, fungi, birds and small mammals are constantly and frighteningly trying to take advantage of these resources.  It is essential that we stay ahead of these natural forces to preserve our food resources.  By using fertilizers, pesticides, and genetic engineering we can do this and keep costs affordable at the same time.  Companies like Monsanto address these needs.  That's why they produce new seeds every year.  There's no reason why a farmer can't stock up on seeds for the next 10 years with this year's breed, but they don't because those seeds would be less productive.  Mike doesn't mention that farmers overwhelmingly support companies like Monsanto and the reasons are obvious to anyone who actually knows what they are talking about.

I for one do not wish to see the entirety of the worlds forests and vast spaces opened up to low-productivity farming which is what Michael's vision would entail.  Nearly everyone would have to farm if we didn't use our technology.  Like with shovels and hoes and pulling weeds.  He points to Cuba as a positive example of this.  But he forgets that no one wanted to do this in Cuba.  They had to.  Cuba wants modern techniques and that is why tractors are some of the first things being sold to Cuba.  People want to go to school, and live a hard-labor-free life.  It's why immigrants to the U.S. have always worked so hard, so their children wouldn't have to. Mike forgets a basic tenet of human nature in that we prefer to take the easier way.  No one wants to spend their days in the dirt under the sun.  And if Cuba was so great, why do so many people risk their lives to flee?

He calls this local farming a ""new paradigm""... I laughed so hard at this.  He's actually referring to the most base and inefficient level of an agrarian culture.

Civilization arose like this on at least three independent occasions:  Depleted game due to over population led to first cultivation of resources that were already being gathered ""locally"".  People became sedentary to protect these cultivations.  Some land was better for one resource than another, so villages began trading.  Some people raided these villages.  Eventually these raiders settled down and took bribes for sparing lives and protection from other raiders.  These raiders obtained a number of villages in a prehistoric mafia and one of them declared himself king.  Trading and memes brought technology like the plow, livestock, et cetera freeing more people from food production to other specializations like textiles, smithing, etc.. The dangers of drought and famine and mismanagement led to war, so empires evolved out of the kingdoms to provide better safety in food production by sheer numbers.  This safety was also increased through large-scale trading between nations, empires, and city states.  This redundancy in food production led to more labor specialization and further advancements into a snowball that is modern history.

There is nothing new about this paradigm. And when Michael starts to tear up about the idea of being a noble savage, I wonder at his delusions.  Can he sit there in his clothes, smoking cigarette after cigarette, having driven or even flown to the studio for this filming, and not recognize the utter hypocrisy of his words?  There was nothing noble about spending your waking hours feeding yourself and only living for around 30 years.  It was a hard life and it's thankfully in the past, no time for Mike to even walk his dog... We would have no people do anything but food production, no medicine, no schools, a primeval existence.  And what about people living in arid or Arctic/sun-Arctic environments?  How do they grow locally?

In reality, Michael's dream world would revert to a feudal state full of constant famines and war.  We would also see an increase in nature's adaptation to our agricultural habitats as more land used in farming would equal more opportunities for evolution further increasing famine and war.

Michael then goes on to scaremonger about the fragility of our food transportation system.  Yes it is known that a sudden loss of refined fuels would lead to a collapse of food supplies within days to weeks, but that could only happen in the case of an asteroid, nuclear war, or possibly a severe pandemic.  In reality, a decline in the abundance of refined fuels would cause prices to rise steadily until they are prohibitive and push companies to develop other sources of energy for our trains, planes, and trucks (or whatever else we devise) and so the decline of refined fuels will naturally erode away based simply on supply and demand and will appear to occur seamlessly.

He wraps up with a an appeal to find balance with nature.  This is another myth. I'm an anthropologist, and no creature, man being no exception, has ever lived in ""balance"" with nature.  Nature is a constant struggle as Darwin said.  If there was balance, then there wouldn't be a world of diverse species, no evolution would need occur.  The noble savages he believes in had to spread all over the world just to eat.  No balance there otherwise they'd never go anywhere.  They drove who-knows-how-many-species to extinction before we even learned to farm.  The noble savage living in harmony with nature is a naive, misinformed fantasy.  The best way we will live in balance with nature is to develop technologies through demand that eliminate the need for things agriculture and labor all together.  We are moving towards that future, if we can avoid total war.

The truth is that the world is moving forward as it always has.  His sustainability movement isn't actually sustainable, it's regressive and dangerous. Peak oil is a myth because supply and demand will dictate the time that we transition.  The shortest path the a better world is forward, not back.

There are always cultural backlashes to progress, and this man's unsubstantiated ramblings are just another example of that.  The rhetoric we see today is similar to what we've seen throughout history.  Michael Ruppert isn't special.  He doesn't know anything anymore than a religious prophet does.  He simply has conviction.  I think the filmmakers would have made a more interesting film if they had explored the nature of conspiracy theorists, the people that believe this stuff, and the ego-mania of one Michael Ruppert.  Plus there is something inherently detached about a person who smokes cigarettes at his age, almost like the person lacks either the will or the ability to be introspective.  And that is not someone who can actually think critically.  Despite declaring himself an expert in critical thinking, his actions and his baseless, misinformed ideas point to a more reactionary, emotional worldview.",1458950400,6,12927,4.945682451253482

It is now 7 years past this documentary and we are seeing dramatic reductions in oil consumption, so much so that we are now to the point that production far exceeds demand and the cost of gas prices has dropped significantly.

The reality is that the world is moving towards more sustainable technology and there is sufficient oil to sustain the basic demands that we don't currently have alternative options for.

Why was he a renter?  Wouldn't a guy with his background, pensions, income, etc. be able to afford to OWN a home? and 2.  When he said he's a strong believer about buying and holding Gold as a hedge against the failing dollar - is that just his 'feelings' yet he owns no gold?  It seems like a guy with his knowledge and past jobs, etc...would be in a financial position to be better off than such a damning statement of 'facing eviction from a rental house (apartment?) at the end.  That however didn't undermine my feelings on his knowledge of what he was talking about - just sounds like personally, he may have skipped out on taking much of his own advice.  For me though - I am glad I watched.  I'm definitely taking steps to protect my wealth.  I only was a renter from the ages of 18-20.

Peak oil may already have been reached, and the shale oil fields like the Bakken and shale gas fields and more under-ocean fields will provide a temporary supply for a relatively short continuation of petroleum. The days of cheap oil are past and politicians who talk about lowering gasoline pricesa are wrong.  Shale oil and gas cost more to recover than the giant fields of the past.  We must develop nuclear plants for electricity,  find a way to use our enormous supply of coal, and continue development of solar and wind electricity in order to prevent the collapse that Ruppert predicts.  Our dysfunctional government has failed for 45 years to develop a coherent energy policy and the future seems to promise the continuance of politics, politics, and more politics as the goal and perhaps therefore, the slow collapse could happen.",1406246400,,946,4.962025316455696
4109506,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"This is a must see movie. This presents how the USA has been lied to about everything they believe to be true. We are all monkeys or dinosaurs as Michael put it. We have got to throw off the old machinery of political theater of any kind including capitalism, mainly because it has gotten out of control and without regulations it spawns slavery and death camps. The Holocaust was nothing compared to what is about to fall upon us. Even Israel today looks more like 1944 Germany than it does any paradise or religious nirvana. All over the world religion is tearing down any progress and will soon bring us back to fascism and death to all who oppose it. We can't even begin to understand the workings of a greedy group of people who would sell heroin to their own children to make a buck. Because if we were serious about getting rid of heroin, we would have already burned the poppy fields in Afghanistan. But we haven't. The excuse being it would wipe out what little economy they have. Okay, but control them and make sure oil can flow freely. Oil and fracking for gas and the greedy SOBs who do it with no regard towards the species itself, will soon reap what they have sown. When the collapse comes, I hope you have a safe place because within two weeks after the stores close due to power outage, there will be total chaos and then collapse. If you need an example of stupidity, just look at Mitch McConnell who has been in Washington way too long. He is still the biggest supporter of coal which is destroying his home state of Kentucky and West Virginia. Duke, Freedom Enterprises, Massey Energy, who killed hundreds and went bankrupt but will be shown to have killed thousands due to pollution promoted by Mitch McConnell, all get a free ride from those who they lobby in Washington. But we not have time left even if they see what is happening. By 2020, if we have not done the work to establish the solar and wind solution, we will be screwed. But, do you think those who are holding stock in Chevron and Exxon are going to cash in anytime soon. No, this is the American dream of becoming rich no matter the effect it has on your world, your children and your species. I believe he is right on target and it is a tough show to watch. But, you have to educate yourself because no one else will. Watch ""Physics for Future Presidents"" at UC Berkeley. http://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/Courses/physics10/teaching/Physics10/PffP.html - This will at least explain the fundamental nature of the world to understand what he is talking about here. Look up the Iran-Contra affair and see that Oliver North is now a ""news commentator"" for Faux News. A pit-bull for the streaming lies of the affluent. He lives in a compound in Virginia. Why? Because he knows what is coming soon. You can't let people hog all the money and then expect society to be able to buy what you produce. It will all ""Collapse"". He smokes but many do because we were lied to about ""the health benefits"" also for nearly 150 years of advertising non-truth. Keep believing mainstream media and you will be smoking one day also, only angrily. #kerplunk",1405987200,,3128,4.5875

When any of us figure it out, do we end up face down in our swimming pools of that knowledge?

We can only hope that Spirit will prevail. And drain the pool before we all drown in it.

We all, including me, think that we are doing fine if our credit cards aren't rejected and our car looks good. Oh yes, our big beautiful homes too. They certainly count, don't they?

The gods turned us loose on this Planet just to see what we would do with our free will, hence creativity. But we all act as if there is not enough, so we have to take from others. Over and over.

Isn't insanity doing the same things over and over, expecting different results?

Michael told us money is useless, that it's just paper. So where does our value lie? Not in our credit cards, although American Express tells us that we are nothing if we don't have their card.

He discusses the axiomatic fact that if Saudi Arabia is drilling offshore and has reached its peak oil production, then the entire world has reached peak oil. According to Ruppert, no alternative resource will be able to replace the edifice of oil, and therefore, civilization as we know it is going to collapse.

Read the book of Revelation - etc.  The whole premise of the Bible is about the establishment of God's Kingdom over the Earth, the Vindication of his name, Jehovah.

This government by and for the people really relies on regular reformation to bring it back to its founding principles, and our history has many significant examples of us doing just that, not the least of which was our civil war.  So there would be every reason to think as things get worse there will eventually be a correction.  However, like religion, the ability to sense that we've deviated from the ideal (and by how much) depends on some significant portion of the populace knowing the faith, and there is mounting evidence that we barely have critical mass of citizens and leaders who actually do know the fundamentals of ""America and how it is different than anything else on earth.  This is the valid wake up call of Mr. Ruppert's story.

Spoiler alert:  While he clings to an underlying sense of conspiracy on behalf of the government, big oil, economics, and the like, he simultaneously attempts the pull a thread through them all without ever fully convincing the watcher (not me anyway) that his claims are credible.  Yes, he cites his credentials as a speaker and cop and then claims a sort of clairvoyance that his 30 years as a journalist allow him to ""...put the dots closer together..."" in such a way that the picture becomes clear.  What I don't understand, then, is his insistence on chain smoking during the interview unless it is symbolic of his exasperation and futile attempts to change people and their mindsets as a nation.  Surely he has heard that chain smoking cigarettes is not good?  It is a bit ironic that his habit is fully dependent on the very thing he despises.  The ultimate implication is that everyone else is a lemming - or puppet - with no real chance at freedom or individual thought unless they change and become self sufficient and adapt (while invoking Darwinism and evolution) so that the fittest survive the inevitable and forthcoming doom.  Finally, if he is such an adapter and visionary himself, then why has he failed to adapt to the world as it is currently governed?

It's hard to put it all together yourself unless you dedicate your life to investigating it like he has. However, this documentary has put it all into perspective and has also educated me on many things I have only touched on in my own self education process.

I now have a very clear understanding of what I suspected is coming and truly believe he is correct. Once you see this film, and if you haven't been completely self absorbed your whole life, you too will come to the inescapable truth, the collapse will happen. I came to this conclusion on my own before understanding all the factors related to an inevitable collapse. The primary thinking that brought me to that conclusion was the uncontrolled growth of human population and uncontrolled consumption. Our world cannot support infinite growth and at some point, we will go into decline until we learn to live in balance with our planet. That time is coming, and sooner than most people think.

Here, he's spot on with books like ""Limits To Growth"" and what many people are talking about in the degrowth movement.

However, in some places he makes wild predictions, like saying people in the future will accept gold rather than paper money. Most economists dismiss this argument about gold, but it's idiots over the recession who have run the prices up on themselves. Gold has never had some intrinsic value that paper money doesn't. It's the ignorant Ron Paul types who think having gold is the answer. Gold is just like paper money - it only has value because we say it does. Gold has very little practical use, and the fact that it's a finite resource does not mean anything.

It is important to see the limits to our growth and the coming slow collapse of industrial civilization from overpopulation, resource depletion, pollution, and climate change, but I think it's wrong to make wild predictions about when and how things will unfold, and to prepare by hoarding gold. You're betting to prepare by paying off debts, learning to live simply, and forming interdependent community.

Considering this documentary was made a few years ago his  point on oil prices being stabilized seem to be right on.  Retail gasoline has been going up and down between three and four dollars a gallon for several years.  We haven't even came close to really conserving but if the price jumps to high we will.  For instance if every office worker who could work from home did we probably wouldn't need to import oil anymore.  We could do that right now without any significant investment.  The technology for remote work is built into modern PC.s and practically every office worker has internet at home.  Some companies like HP, IBM, etc., actively encourage workers to work from home.  Most companies don't however.  They will use words like ""collaboration"" as an excuse to keep people in the office yet outside of meetings there is little collaboration.  The hallway impromptu meetings that Yahoo's new CEO sited as a reason to eliminate remote workers are 99.999999% of the time not job related.  The reality is that most people don't have time to collaborate.  Anyhow.

The financial system is scary since in the US our dollar is backed by the faith and trust the world has in the productivity of the American worker.  Since the vast majority of manufacturing jobs have been off-shored there is trouble brewing in that regard.

Growing food locally seems like a good idea but it will never work in the US.  There is simply not enough land available to grow anything more than supplementing what there is available at the store.

Given Michael Ruppert's extensive family background ties to our Government and Military Agencies, it's no wonder his career steered him right into the middle of our political and economical battles.
'Sweet' and to the point this movie is a must see regardless of your position in politics! It addresses our gross consumption of oil in everything we do and own, how resources have led the US into war, the fraud of fiat currency, and the corruption and farce behind large corporations and our government. As sad as our masked state of affairs is, it is even sadder that fewer and farther inbetween will stand up at all costs to cease any further injustice as Ruppert tries. He urges everyone to become more self-sufficient and self-reliant, educate yourself and that as a whole if we really wanted to change our practices we could stop further deterioration of our society.
There are two perspectives in particular that stuck with me the most in this film, 1) Regardless of who is elected President, they have neither the power or control to make the changes and right the wrongs that we ask for, so the sooner you have closure to this the sooner you can lower your expectations for any actual resolution or actions from who ever is currently in office.
2) Once you decide what side of the fence you are on and choose what you'd rather believe, you find yourself going through the stages of grief (as if a loved one died).

I highly recommend this movie, especially if you expect to contribute and be a productive memeber of society. I feel it is people's responsobility to fully educate themselves before voting and making large decisions that will negatively impact future generations...sometimes it is not in choosing the lesser of two evils, but the harder sacrifice for the greater reward in the future.",1383782400,,2006,4.731428571428571

4109622,2,B003CJXJ8Q,"With a title like ""Collapse"", its hard to imagine you'd get a balanced picture of Ruppert's views. And in fact, this film presents an entirely uncritical portrait of him; there is barely a word from the filmmaker that challenges the way Ruppert sees the world.

Which is too bad, because Ruppert has a decidedly mixed record. He's, in my view, credible on the issue of CIA drug smuggling, an 80's-era bugbear that turned out to be true. But he's also a 9/11 Truther who spent the last decade taking speaker fees to talk about thermite charges and Bush/Cheney hegemony to the tinfoil hat crowd.

And his credibility is waning. Most of this interview is predicated on the shaky 70's-era Peak Oil stuff, which looks less true than ever in an era of fracking and Venezuelan oil. He's a prepper who lives less than 10 miles from I-10. He's a back-to-the-land advocate who simultaneously brushes off the power of human ingenuity. When he's not being self-contradicting, he's being delusional. It's hard to watch at times.

As a film, it has technical merit (the music is good, and its well edited), but the filmmaker was entirely out to lunch. Claims like Ruppert's need to be either challenged or contextualized, or both. They miss the boat on this. It tries to be a  a technical doppelgnger of Errol Morris' superb ""The Fog Of War"". Watch that, skip this.",1362528000,,1351,4.736170212765957

He asserts that oil will run out relatively soon and that will lead to the collapse of the world.  Since this film has been released we have of course found lots more oil in unusual places, like the coast of Brazil, tar sands in Canada, and most recently 233 billion barrels in southern Australia.  Couple that with declining demand in the US I think he whiffed on this claim.

He also goes on a long Malthusian rant about how the Earth won't support ever growing populations and the soil is crappy.  Again he doesn't seem too accurate as the world population is still growing and new ways to grow more food seems to be on the rise.

His last big assertion as well as many conspiracy nuts is about the money system being a complete sham.  Yes we have fiat money everyone that takes econ 101 in HS or college knows this, its not world shaking.  Like most people that espouse this big sham he advises you buy gold.  The gold standard he says was the age we should ascribe to.  This is when currency made sense.  Except it didn't.  You can always mine more gold or silver, etc. And we have and now there is more precious metal available than ever.  Top that off with the fact that gold is as worthless as paper money with numbers written on it when you think about it.  He say you can put a dollar in a gas tank or eat it so it's a total joke.  So isn't gold also a total joke?  You can't eat or burn it for heat or fuel.

4109633,3,B003CJXJ8Q,"First, a brief comment about the film itself: The production values are crude, apparently by design. The short bits of video footage that accompany the narration are grainy and shaky. Worse, Ruppert's voice (and Smith's as well, when he does speak) are unclear and echoey. Perhaps this is intended to fit the dystopian nature of the subject being portrayed, but IMHO the effect is severe enough to detract from the message. This is why I gave it three stars. Otherwise it would get five because, as I'll explain, it really is ""so bad it's good.""

It's now 2013, and we should keep in mind that this video was created in 2009 (perhaps even partly in 2008). If the process Ruppert was describing was occurring the way he said it was, we should all be in really dire straits. Indeed, I might not have had the money for the DVD, nor a place to watch it. Not only should it be obvious by now that oil has peaked, but we should be well below the peak, with oil fields being depleted at the rate of several percent a year that Ruppert referred to. Clearly, it hasn't happened. By 2006 Ruppert was saying, at From The Wilderness, that the unfolding collapse would be obvious by September 2006. In the video, he admits to his timing being off by ""a year, maybe a year and a half."" Try a full TWO years: He refers specifically to the bank collapses of September 2008, which were fully two years later. And while employment has only crawled back, its failure to grow vigorously resulting in millions of personal tragedies, the fact remains that the actual economic contraction was over in the US by the middle of 2009--not the collapse he had in mind.

The real collapse is that of Ruppert himself. This spectacle happens right in front of the camera; and if it were not so obvious what a personal toll this man's belief system takes on him, it would be easy to laugh at him. Instead, you want to cry, in part because it is all so unnecessary. What's scary is that Ruppert is not just a sleazy con artist or a charlatan; he's a true believer. Take a good look at what happens to someone who totally buys into a set of very, very bad ideas. Here's a cautionary tale, the kind that comes along only once in a while.

Ruppert says he doesn't even want to debate anyone about this any more, because by now ""it's all so obvious."" It appears there was a debate he needed to have with himself, and those near him, and did not. Inconsistencies abound. He says we need a Jefferson, not a Lincoln, that Jefferson said a revolution now and then is necessary; oh, but then he's careful to say he's not advocating a violent overthrow of anything, rather a revolution in the human mind. Of course, this was not at all what Jefferson had in mind, but that little complication somehow slipped away unnoticed. He says, ""I'm not a messiah. The only person I'm responsible for saving is me""; yet he embarked on an all-consuming advocacy of his views, including multiple books, a DVD, a blog, more than one newsletter, and travel to at least two other countries to escape his troubles in the US. None of that seems necessary, just to save himself from the coming collapse.

Probably inevitably, he trots out other favorite shibboleths of those who predict the end of the world as we know it. Fiat currency is blamed as an integral part of the problem, along with fractional reserve banking, even though both of these things were around long before any of us, and were working at least reasonably well before other, less sustainable factors were brought into play in the last three decades or so, to result in unprecedented concentration of wealth and huge increases in public debt. If ""the whole economy is a pyramid scheme,"" it's one that worked for an amazingly long time until very recently.

In the Collapse interview, Ruppert gives a glimpse into just how disconnected he was becoming from reality, when he suddenly pauses--he later says, when struck by a sudden epiphany, the realization that the President really is powerless to change the dire situation we all share. How can this be a sudden shock of realization, when it's obviously such a central part of his whole line of reasoning?
Here's the reality: While Ruppert tells you that ""there is nothing, anywhere, in any combination, that will replace the edifice built by fossil fuels,"" in fact the replacement is already well under way. 40 years ago, oil was almost (but not quite) half of the world energy picture. Now, it's less than three quarters as big a slice. Some of oil's slice of the pie has been taken by coal, but it's been spread among gas, nuclear, and even renewables as well. Like Albert Bartlett, who is still sounding the alarm about ""exponential"" population growth 50 years after it ceased to be exponential, or like generals who know all about how to fight the last war, Ruppert is transfixed by a specter that is already fading.

4109636,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"""Collapse"" is a somewhat curious documentary, essentially being an extended interview with one man, Michael Ruppert.

Ruppert is often accused of being a conspiracy theorist, but since I haven't read his books or followed his now defunct newsletter, I can't really judge that issue. ""Collapse"" mentions conspiracy theory mostly in passing, and instead concentrates on the peak oil issue and its ramifications. I admit that I liked the film. It reminds me of John Michael Greer, James Howard Kunstler and similar authors. There is a certain tension in the film between Ruppert talking about peak oil, and the interviewer wanting him to talk more about himself (he seems to have had a pretty colourful career!).

Those familiar with the issues will recognize most of the material covered. In fact, it's pretty basic: peak oil, the almost complete dependence of our modern civilization (including agriculture) on oil or gas, the impossibility of replacing the fossil fuels with alternative forms of energy, etc. ""Collapse"" points out that all forms of alternative energy are ultimately dependent on the oil economy - for instance, you need oil to replace standard cars with electric cars.

Ruppert predicts financial panic as the next crisis turns out to be unsolvable because of the super-debt and the decrease in oil production. Some nations might explode or even collapse, such as Saudi Arabia or Dubai. Mass starvation and depopulation will be another consequence of the crisis. American society will be in for a rough ride, as well.

Ruppert don't believe survivalism in the hills is an option, unless you are already very well prepared for it - which most people are not. Instead, the solution is to create strong, resilient, local communities, presumably in some kind of urban or semi-urban settings. Humans must come to terms with the fact that natural laws cannot be overturned or bended anyway we like them to, and that no god will intervene to save us from our own folly. Yet, Ruppert isn't anti-spiritual. In fact, he calls for an individual spiritual transformation: ""I'm not the Messiah, I'm not trying to save anyone, except myself"".

The most curious part of ""Collapse"" features Ruppert's musings about Cuba and North Korea, two Communist nations which suffered their own version of peak oil after Russia stopped its oil deliveries. Ruppert claims that Cuba promoted ""capitalist"" local initiative and freed organic agriculture from state regulations, thereby mitigating the crisis. By contrast, North Korea simply continued with its super-centralized planned economy, and ended up with a massive famine as a result. Despite not being a leftist, Ruppert actually sounds pro-Cuban!

Although Ruppert isn't as apocalyptic as the more extreme doomers (in this, he resembles Greer), he is nevertheless very upset and emotional about the human predicament, and almost starts crying at several points in the interview. I get the feeling that he doesn't really think the human race is going to make it... The gloomy feeling is compounded by the interview being made in a dark room with a prison-like wall, Ruppert being dressed in a monochrome outfit, making it seem that he's been incarcerated!

As I already indicated, ""Collapse"" is an introduction to the peak oil issue (or issues), not an in-depth analysis with all the possible arguments pro and con laid out before the viewer. If you are new to these issues, you need to complement it. ""The Long Descent"" by John Michael Greer, ""The Long Emergency"" by James Howard Kunstler and ""Energy Myths and Realities"" by Vaclav Smil are three good places to start. Perhaps Ruppert's own books are good too, but unfortunately I haven't read them.

The interview also contains one major howler: a new version of the 100th monkey myth or urban legend. This time, the story is placed on some US-controlled island in the South Pacific (usually it's Japan). But sure, I liked Ruppert's comment about ""searching for the 100th monkey"".

Will that 100th monkey be able to save the Third Chimpanzee? That, I suppose, is the $ 10,000 question.",1356912000,,4082,5.1079460269865065
4109637,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"Synopsis:  Michael Ruppert gives an hour-and-a-half monologue on peak oil, the need to covert to renewable energy, the current financial crisis and its causes, government-sponsored drug trafficking, and other politically-charged topics.  A gritty film with footage to support or highlight his claims, Ruppert delivers his speech in a dark and gripping tone.  Director Chris Smith plays the interviewer and, at times, the devil's advocate.

Under normal circumstances, I'd probably give this documentary 4.5/5 stars.  However, it seems that the neo-liberalist far-right propagandists have taken to Amazon to attack Ruppert for his leftist views when this guy's only crime is being a left-leaning version of Alex Jones.  With that in mind, I'm going to give it the 5 Stars to counter the deceptive one-star ratings that have less to do with the presentation of the film and more to do with people disagreeing with his political views.

Ruppert goes into detail in a way that only he can be able to in order to support his claims.  Anyone expecting a Michael Moore level of fanaticism is going to be sorely disappointed. What they're going to get instead is a gripping testimony from a guy who helped expose the CIA's involvement in the crack epidemic in L.A. and inform people as far back as 2005 that the financial policies embraced by mainstream politicians were leading us to certain financial ruin.  Ruppert never misses a beat and Smith's directing makes the presentation seemless, fluid, and remarkably dark.  I couldn't shut this off and couldn't look away; there was a lot of information to take away from this and regardless if you agree or not, the documentary was poignant and most certainly made you think.

I recommend this for people who are interested in politics and current events.",1355875200,,1796,5.074829931972789
4109638,2,B003CJXJ8Q,"There are two problems with this documentary, or perhaps it is one problem, with two parts.  Part A is that at the time this film was made anyone who made any kind of an objective and reasonably thorough investigation would have known that the world was in fact
swimming in oil.  Part B is that since the film was made it is no longer required that one make any investigation.  The news of the vast
amount of oil all over the place, particularly here in North America, is shouted at us from every media outlet.  Kindergartners are now
probably quite aware of the Black Gold boom in North Dakota.  None of this should hurt the film though, despite the fact that the whole
thing is not merely predicated on the fantasy that there is a looming oil shortage, but about that shortage.  People who want to believe that there is a coming oil shortage will keep on believing that, regardless of the overwhelming evidence that it is not true.",1355270400,,933,4.491124260355029

4109640,1,B003CJXJ8Q,"I turned this movie off after watching it for only 13 minutes.

Here's why:

To start off, ""Peak oil"" is a failed theory based on junk science and held tightly by environmentalists that was created to make a scare in the 1970's. It claims the supply of availible oil has peaked, and henceforth humans are recklessly sucking up the last remaining supplies. Peak proponents usually declare we'll run out of oil in 25 to 30 years. Back in President Jimmy Carter's day, it was only 10 years that was proclaimed to be left of oil. We can see how accurate that statement turned out. We have enough oil in Alaska alone to get us into 2050, and not even including the oil we have throughout Texas, Oregan, Utah, and Washington, we have enough for hundreds of years.

ANWR is the problem when it comes to drilling on our land. Thanks to the Eisenhower administration, these people have put all logical ways of thinking behind them, and instead of drilling on our own land, which would substantially lower gas prices, they use the ""We're here to save animals"" act, which puts a big ""X"" over any part of land we would need to get off of oil dependence in the Middle East. They cover over 19 million acres in Alaska. The Wilderness Society has insidiously cheated Americans out of a spectacular supply of oil, derived from a sliver of the vast region -- a sliver that is virtually uninhabitable to human life.

Once he said ""The ice caps are melting because global warming,"" it was the icing on the cake. Global warming/cooling is real in a sense that it is simply a cycle of earth. Not affected by humans. Anthropogenic global warming has been debunked. Michael Manns' ""Hockey Stick Charts"" have already been found as fraudulent, basically skewing every peice of data. Show me scientific papers that provides the basis for proof of man-made global warming, and I can find you several findings that makes the theory as credible as witches in Salem. Start by explaining Earth's climate prior to the Little Ice Age that began at 1300 A.D. There's a night and day difference between alarmists and skeptics, government paid scientists and independent scientists. I honestly don't know a single person who denies that the planet has been warming over the long haul. What's the suprise? We're still emerging from a Little Ice Age 400+ years ago. There's plenty of evidence if you use your eyes rather than biased computer models. Global warming believers point to events as evidence but ignore events that show evidence to the contrary. Or they say evidence to the contrary is also evidence without any evidence. They also ignore the controversy by claiming the ""science is settled."" Hail storm with three feet of hail on the ground? Anthropogenic global warming. An outbreak of tornadoes? Anthropogenic global warming. Record snow and ice storms in Oklahoma with 22 degrees below 0? Anthropogenic global warming. Floods? Anthropogenic global warming. A plague of locusts? Anthropogenic global warming. The angel of death taking the firstborn of every household? Anthropogenic global warming.

This is scare-tactics at its finest. Whoever is deciding wether or not to watch this movie, don't. You're being fed lies from the beginning.",1353628800,8,3216,4.893577981651376

I debated between a four star or a five star rating, because this is not the slick, polished production we have all become accustomed to expect in today's world. That said, the content and the message won out over the lack of a highly polished production piece. Michael Ruppert has been in a position to know a lot of important information about the way things work in America, and at America's behest how things work on a global scale. His continued investigative journalism has been successful in exposing the activities being conducted in our names as American taxpayers; activities that most citizens would certainly not approve of given the truth in these matters.

I'm sorry that those people got ripped off. I'm not sure what Michael Ruppert's agenda is, but the majority of his opinions appear to have been pulled from thin air. It really pained me to have to give this film even 1 star - the minimum allowed. It would have been -5 stars if that rating was available.",1349913600,,462,4.261363636363637
4109645,1,B003CJXJ8Q,"They say that there's nothing more dangerous than a retired badge.  Michael Ruppert indeed stood before CIA Director John Deutsch at a South Central LA citizen's meeting, November 15, 1996, to say after Gary Webb's story in the San Jose Mercury News, owned by Knight Ridder (Knight family....Nike, China, slave wages)that he knew the CIA had been importing drugs for a very long time. Bill Clinton was afraid that in the wake of the Rodney King riots on top of Webb's story, that an all out race war would ensue...over one set of chains being replaced by another.  So why had no one really heard of Ruppert before that?  Why no bigger whistle blowing prior to Webb's story?  From 1992 he has so much to go on following Peter Brewton's THE MAFIA, CIA and GEORGE BUSH, with its connections to the Iran-Contra pipeline, to drug running and all manner of clandestine CIA/Mafia funds funneled in a myriad of ways and places. So here is Ruppert letting us know that he sprung the Pat Tillman case and that caused someone to smash his computers and so he's shutting down his newsletter, FROM THE WILDERNESS, and is now living in Culver City, Colorado and unable to pay his rent.  With a lengthy police career and pension?  With book royalties and one book in the Harvard Business School Library? And now a film...though it sure is dark in what looks like an Abu Ghraib prison cell with the interrogator, ah interviewer, off camera.

The message?  The world is going to hell in a hand basket. Plant a garden. Avoid debt. Buy gold. If all derivitites were called in tomorrow the world would owe $170 trillion dollars and there's not that much money available on the leveraged debt.  The $14 trillion of US debt is following the $170 trillion into a drain hole. Smoke alot of cigarettes, but you might also want to plant tobacco.  Or, though Ruppert doesn't mention this one either, plant some marijuana, cause it's easier to cultivate and may be needed after Ruppert gets lung cancer...thank you Brown & Williamson, Brown & Root,KBR and the engineers of big oil....whose petro-chem fertilizers make tobacco grow well, too, but kill bees in the process. The world is on a suicide course....might as well join 'em.

Ruppert is also the one who adamantly claims that Gary Webb committed suicide on December 10th, 2004 after telling everyone that he'd never do that, that he was being followed and died from two shots to the head. Two shots.  Happens all the time.",1348963200,3,2451,4.714285714285714

This guy is full of shit.  This make chicken little sound sane and tame.  At one point this guy says that the top soil is like a sponge that we spray chemicals on to get things to grow and that because of that we have turned the top soil into a junkie that can no longer make its own nutrients and because we are running out of oil and the raw materials to make those nutrients the soil needs, we won't be able to grow crops.  This is in stark opposition to the fact that in the US alone, we are growing more food and feeding more people now than at any point in history.  The idea that we are running out of oil is laughable especially when there is evidence that the earth actually makes oil.  There are wells drilled 30, 40 and 50 years ago that were expected to be dry within that same time frame that are STILL producing oil today.  At one point he says, Saudi Arabia has 25% of all the world's oil but they are now drilling offshore and then extrapolates that if the Saudis are looking for oil offshore which is more expensive to get then by his logic that means that we have found all the oil we are ever going to find and there is no more to find.  He implies things like, the world leaders are happy that the polar ice caps are melting (which they aren't) because we will now be able to build oil platforms to drill for oil there.  I mean it is on and on and on with one over the top scare tactic claim after another.  The off camera interviewer asks at one point about the 1970's oil shortage claims.  Back in the 70's many said we were just a few years away from no more oil.  The interviewer says, what do you make of those people's claims in relation to your claims today when it is clear that we were able to continue using oil as a energy source for almost 40 years AFTER the so called oil shortage of the 70's.  His response was that in the 70's the economy wasn't very bad, people and governments and companies had money etc. etc. etc. and that we were able to weather the storm (i'm paraphrasing).  But now, the world and the country's economy is really bad so the shit is about to hit the fan.  Seems to me though, his answer sheds light on his goal.  Want to make alot of money and get famous?  Shout to the world that the bottom is about to fall out of humanity and we are all going to be fighting each other for the last bread in a looted grocery store against the backdrop of a real hard recession and you'll scare the shit out of enough people that you can sell a ridiculous movie to a bunch of people who probably have no idea how to use their own brain in order to call BS on folks like Michael Ruppert when they hear him talk.  The interviewer then asks him to talk about his qualifications, education.  He rattles of his history and talks about how he wants to testify to congress and other lawmakers.  He tells us that he has never been able to actually do so.  He sent some written testimony to congress once and they never called him back.  Seems to me, somebody did us a favor and dismissed this idiot as the lunatic he is.  Look at his claims about 9/11 and then fast forward to this story and it is clear to see that this guy is just looking for a buck and will say anything to get it.  How about this, let's see what this guy has to say about peak oil, world starvation and other sensationalist claims in another 40 years when I'm 80 and I'm gassing up my car on the way to my grandaughter's wedding.

And he's vain and arrogant enough to give himself all the screen time.  Some of the things he says may be true but some are not.  He says at one point that we went to Iraq merely to get the oil... though oil certainly was a big part of the reason why we went it was not the sole reason.  People seem to forget that Saddam wanted for a very long time to get rid of his oil and sell it to America as well as other countries.  If we wanted the oil from the region all we would've had to do was ASK as Saddam was practically begging for the sanctions to end.  It would've made him more powerful and in exchange our government would've had all the oil it wanted WITHOUT the expense of a war.  But things weren't that simple as Saddam was a lunatic, At times u.n. sanctions were defied and Iran being so close in proximity with it's equally lunatic dictator salivating for control over Iraq made the situation so volatile that war was imminent.  It can certainly be argued that the war could've been put off longer, but any person with actual knowledge of the situation before the war cannot deny that war was going to happen sooner or later.  With the situation being as it was war was simply inevitable.  And as for us never going to leave Iraq no matter what the politicians say... well anyone who understood the above situation stated above would've been able to tell you that back in the early 2000's.  Yet he says this without mentioning the above facts as if to imply it's some sort of government conspiracy, when in reality it's merely common sense.  U.S. troops still haven't left Germany or Japan since ww2 so why on earth would we ever leave Iraq which currently has Iran next to it just dreaming about taking it over?

4109658,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"Collapse explores Michael Ruppert's decades-long involvement in trying to warn Americans that we are rapidly nearing the end of industrialized civilization.  In this documentary, along with his other works: ""Crossing the Rubicon"" (book) and ""From the Wilderness"" (newsletters and website), Mr. Ruppert satisfactorily explains how the real world works.  Gold, oil and drugs (G.O.D.) form the dark lord that the people who actually run the world essentially worship.  And it is our dependence on oil, and our willingness to accept nonsensical propaganda without question, which makes us complicit in our own destruction.

Profitably accessible oil is either near or past its peak.  We (the industrialized world) have been burning (and otherwise consuming) oil and natural gas at a furious pace.  It is this release of stored solar energy, in the last century, which has brought about calamitous climate change (aka Global Warming).  Petroleum, has also made it possible for the Earth to (temporarily) support our world population of now seven billion people.  Collapse is what happens when the global demand for oil collides with the inexorable fact that we are quickly using up what little oil is still accessible.

The consequences will be horrifying.  Food production will decline sharply, as petroleum-based fertilizer and pesticides become scarce.  Heating and cooling will become unaffordable for the masses.  Rising sea levels (from global warming) will force a huge exodus from the coast.  Soon there will be food riots, rampant criminal behavior (outside of government), and many aspects of our society will simply stop working.  Ruppert estimates that at least four billion people will die before we can regain stability.

The test of any scientific theory is the ability to make accurate, testable predictions, and to explain seemingly inexplicable data from the past.  To this end, Ruppert has shown that many world governments act as if Peak Oil is true.  In particular, this explains the 9/11 (alleged) terrorist attacks as being an inside job, and a pretext for invading Afghanistan, Iraq, and (ultimately) Iran, along with efforts to destabilize the other Muslim countries of the Arab-Spring.

Ruppert, also provides a glimpse into the financial and economic shenanigans being employed to create the current depression, possibly as a way to render those about to be destroyed, helpless.  In the end, I can't think of a more chilling horror movie.  To realize that we and our loved ones are now at risk of entering into an age of poverty, famine, and barbaric struggles for survival, must surely be the most terrifying realistic vision of the future I can imagine.

But there may be some hope left.  In the video, Ruppert creates an analogy of three types of people on the Titanic.  The first are the ""deer in the headlights"" - paralyzed by fear, they wander around, aimlessly bemoaning their fate.  The second are the active realists who say, ""we accept that disaster is coming, what do we need to do to survive?""  And lastly, are those in a state of pathological denial (like many 2 and 3 star reviewers here).  These people cannot accept the writing on the wall, because it is inconceivable in their fixed, inflexible world view.

For those who doubt the validity of the Peak Oil / Global Population Reduction theory, just look at the economics of the last ten years.  Whole countries are defaulting on their loans, suffering pervasive unemployment, and utilities are starting to turn out the lights.",1340668800,,3516,5.1534391534391535

What struck me: Shame on the (somewhat clever) filmmakers for starting off with the swill that the speaker had the equivalent of TS-SCI security clearance as a teenager but didn't know about it. That's absolute bull, but to many people it probably gives him the credibility to discuss a wide variety of topics: ""He probably read tons of classified documents about EVERYTHING!""

That's a noble profession, in my opinion, but it sure doesn't make him qualified to speak as an expert about secret agendas in the fields of agriculture, oil production, telecommunications, economics, global politics, and many others.

Even if a person manages to become an expert in several fields the speaker discusses - which is nearly impossible and certainly not the case here - he/she should cite facts, studies, at least something that backs up his/her claims.

I purchased this DVD from Amazon last year and never bothered to write a review because I thought this work would be rated 4 to 5 stars by everyone.  I'm writing this review now because I'm in disbelief that so many are still caught in the Matrix and are unable to read between the lines and interpret the subtext of the message that the establishment (Banking/Corporate/Military industrial complex that runs government and the main-stream-media) wants everyone to accept and endorse.  I see there are still many out there who are happy to be ""herd animals"" and believe everything the establishment tells them.  If you can watch this intrepid message and not get it you are living an illusory existence that reflects how you want the world to be and not how the world is.  Collapse is not only imminent it has already begun and only the blind can miss it?  I do not argue with the right you have to your opinion, but only to give a contrasting opinion.

Most (23?) of his 25 recommendations in the book ""Confronting Collapse ..."" are sensible.  But our political system is utterly incapable of implementing them.

so if you came here looking for a good movie about doom and gloom, you're not likely to read any of the negative comments, just the 5-star ones. I hope this 5-star comment opens your eyes to the other side of ""truth.""

This narrator is not credible. That's really what it boils down to. He gives one minute of lip service to each of the alternative energy sources and nonchalantly signs off each of them. He has a bachelor's degree in political science. This does not make him a scientist in any way. He is no more an expert than you or I if we spent a few weeks doing our own research on the subject matter, and I encourage you to do so.

The good thing about this movie is that it might make you ask the right questions. Hopefully, you'll do something this guy has not done, which is review some CURRENT scientific studies about the alternative energy sources and how efficient they really are.

In the end, I'm not saying this movie deserves 1-star either. Like I said, it may do some good and provoke some questions.

4109691,3,B003CJXJ8Q,"I read one reviewer who was peeved that this was the supposition of a person with no specialized knowledge, but apparently that reviewer must have expected some form of ""expert"" opinion.  Let's be realistic.  Any documentary is putting forth a thesis.  This one was backed by an individual who has written and spoke in connection with that thesis.  Take it for what it is worth... opinion.  Just like when the chairman of the Federal Reserve gives an opinion, or the weatherman.  In both of those cases, they have maybe a better than 50% chance of getting it right, but never 100%.  That's because things like the economy (as it exists), or the weather, are not an exact science.  If they were, they would be 100% right, all the time.

In this case, we are shown a very specific thesis, from a very specific point of view.  It's an interview of one man, on his writings, stated research, and opinions.  That's what it is.  If you have an interest in ""conspiracy theories"", then this will be of interest.

Frankly, there are many instances of people with no ""specialized knowledge"" whom have educated themselves through research, experience, etc. to credible ends.  A lack of any specialized degrees or position does not in itself make his opinions or ideas any less valid for those reasons.  But, that also doesn't make the content presented valid either.  That is for you to decide.

Speaking strictly on some of the economic issues he talks about, I can tell you from my education that it makes a great deal of both common sense, as well as economic sense.  Just because there is one dominant, accepted school of economic thought doesn't mean that school is the only one, or the right one.  Economists from the Austrian school have spoken about fiat money, and a great deal of this for some time.  Economics 101 ( in any school ) is that resources are finite.  People want National Health Care, and abundant entitlement programs... and politicians pander, as if these things were a right.  We simply don't have the resources for them.  Every country that has tried this ( save maybe a few very small countries ) are now going broke, and even when such things were in place, terminal patients came here, as the lines for treatment were so long under such systems.  It should make common sense that you can't continually spend more than you have, and expect anything but ruin, but apparently these are lessons that still must be learned the hard way.  So in that regard, what he talks about makes good sense.  As to the rest, it is for you to decide.",1324771200,9,2550,4.648769574944072
4109692,3,B003CJXJ8Q,"Michael Ruppert makes some interesting, and possibly valid points:

1. The earth has limited resources, which the human race needs to learn to adapt to and respect, or perish.
2. The love of money is the root of all evil.

These are thought provoking, but not, in my opinion, worthy of being made into a talking-head documentary movie. There are much better examples of the ""we're messing up the world and we're probably screwed unless we make a big change"" genre.

Have you ever been stuck on a long cab ride with a crazy, rambling driver who starts trying to engage you in a political discussion?

That's what this movie is like. You just want it to be over.

Mr. Ruppert is clearly very passionate about the subjects he discusses. He is also not the type of calm and collected person whose opinions and purportedly 'academic' research I value. He has to take several breaks to cry when his emotion overcomes him, he has frequent profane outbursts, he smokes continually through the interview, and brings his dog with him. I understand he's decided not to try and change the system from within, but he makes little effort to appear credible beyond frequent references to his research (with no discussion of his methods). The resultant 'map' he has developed is the MacGuffin of the movie. We are told nothing of its substance, but it is guiding Ruppert's fervent world-view.

Ruppert frequently refers to the mysterious 'we', and implores us to change our minds, and ""think like we do"". He finishes the movie by comparing himself to a hypothetical prophet who predicted the atrocities of the Third Reich.

My ultimate criticism of Mr. Ruppert's discourse is that he ultimately fails to give any firm advice on what we should do to save ourselves from the ""suicide of our species"", other than a disparate idea of revolution, and his ""quest for the hundredth monkey"" who will change mankind's behavior. He is visibly offended at the mere suggestion that he give up this quest.

The endnote of the movie is the most moving moment, for me.:

""Michael Ruppert currently lives in Culver City, California.
Michael has stopped researching and writing about collapse.
His latest book came out in May and was largely ignored.
He now spends his time writing lyrics and playing music.
He is currently late on his rent and trying to avoid eviction.""

In my opinion, you can think of this movie from two perspectives. Whether it is a documentary on the ills of society and the need for change, or about the perpetual anguish of a deeply troubled man is up to you.",1323561600,5,2551,4.751131221719457
4109693,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"The most important thing that Michael says in the film that we can do is to open our minds. Critically think about and challenge what is going on around us and what we take in. This includes this movie-- think critically about it and don't take it as truth simply because Michael seems smart. Otherwise you're just letting somebody think for you. In school there are students that believe every word a teacher says or people who believe every idea in a textbook. You'll get a different flavor for history between reading Zinn's ""A People's History"" versus say, ""A Patriot's History."" So which lens of history is true? While these sources (teachers and textbooks) generally would have a higher truth value, I think Michael's argument for the importance of critically thinking about things is very important. It's all in the mindset.

Overall however, I thought that ""Collapse"" was poignant. While I didn't agree with Everything that Michael talked about, the broad scope of his argument is indisputable. We live in a world of finite resources. Our entire society runs on an unsustainable consumption of these finite resources. Our unsustainability will, and is, causing problems. The unsustainability of the world is clear just by looking around- overfishing, over harvesting, over logging, problems associated with global climate change, and more. Peak oil is not made up, and the best researchers believe that we have no more that 35-50 years of recoverable oil left. Likely, we will stop using oil far before that because it will become way too expensive to use-- alternative energies will be the better economic decision by comparison. But the best scientists say that it will take at least 10 years (if we book it) to move from our current energy paradigm to one based on renewable energies. Currently, 37% of all the energy used in the U.S. is from petroleum, and oil additionally makes everything from pesticides to tires to plastics. Ultimately we're going to need to shift to a green-based energy economy. Oil is not an infinite resource. So we better start now. Michael's argument calls for a complete rethinking of the way we do things--- and with the facts to back him up we need a rethink, or else.

While Michael also does say that our current economic meltdown would cause a collapse of our society, that didn't happen. If the federal government didn't take the measures that it did take, certainly we may have had a depression worse than the Great Depression. But I don't think it's time to throw in the towel and move to the hills to start homesteading just yet. If there were to be a complete collapse of society than sure that would be a good idea. But I don't think that collapse is imminent. If we keep on our same trajectory as we are on right now for the next 20 years, then sure, we may be headed towards collapse. But I think that there's still time for us to change the way we do things (as unlikely as that may seem). It may look like the world is going to hell in a hand basket right now, what with international terrorism, the imbroglio in the Middle East, global climate change and overconsumption of the world's resources, the economic woes of certain European countries, and the list goes on. But keep an open mind and think critically about the world around you. Just as a side, Carl Sagan's ""The Demon-Haunted World"" is very good at arguing for the importance of critical thought. We do need a new way of doing things, and hopefully enough people can become aware of our unsustainability that this new way will become realized. I think, as Michael does too, that the issue of our unsustainability right now in the 21st century is perhaps the greatest challenge that humanity has ever faced. From it stems all of our economic, social, and environmental concerns.",1323129600,,3794,4.773211567732115

You stupid suckers!  Oil comes from the mantle/center of the earth and not from ""fossils"".  As long as the earth exists it will continue to push oil and natural gas up from the hot core of the earth.  Thats what happens because the center of the earth is extremely hot and that heat forces oil and gas up as a by-product of the heat and melting rocks.  If it didn't then how is it that old oil wells in Texas that were closed down 30-50 years ago because they were 'dry' are now producing wells again?  its because more oil oozed up from the center of the earth and began refilling these chambers.

But big oil companies and enviro-wackos would love for you to believe that oil is scarce - its not. its a replenishing resource.

Now, that is not to say that we shouldn't treat any natural resource prudently, but there is no need to panic. This guy - and other enviro-wackos - have made a huge mistake with their life and wasted lots of time and effort.  Oh, and if you dont' believe me - ask the Russians how they find all their oil.

That we're all teetering on the brink of a very steep precipice? (Feel free to insert your own doom-and-gloom metaphor here, if you'd like).

Well, if so, you may just want to go hide under your covers or jump into a hole and pull it in after you (or at least make yourself a good, stiff drink) after watching ""Collapse,"" as starkly pessimistic a look at humanity's future as you could ever hope - or not hope - to see. If nothing else, this film could do wonders for Prozac sales.

It takes awhile to even figure out what ""Collapse"" is really all about. That's partly because the subject of Chris Smith's documentary, Michael Ruppert - investigative journalist, author, lecturer, self-taught energy expert, corporate whistleblower and overall Voice of Doom - is so freewheeling and free-ranging in the extended rant he delivers for the camera that we often have trouble tying all the loose ends together into a coherent whole. But danged if his ""crazy,"" ""conspiracy-theory"" view of how the world actually works doesn't begin to make sense and to take some sort of root in our psyche - leaving us both depressed and scared out of our collective wits by film's end.

Ruppert lays the blame for most of the world's ills directly at the feet of Big Oil, or, more accurately, on our insane dependence on a substance that is part of virtually every product we use in our daily lives and that, ironically, is even necessary for so-called ""green"" technologies to function. This, of course, has led to a great deal of corporate and governmental corruption which Ruppert outlines for us in graphic detail - not to mention all the wars fought over it.

But Ruppert's tirade has only just begun. He explains in detail the derivatives-based cause of the recent worldwide financial collapse and shows how the entire global economy is little more than a massive, ultimately unsustainable ""pyramid scheme"" that is doomed to collapse of its own weight, sooner rather than later, bringing all of us down with it.

And if that isn't white-knuckle-inducing enough for you, Ruppert then predicts the end of a paradigm, comparable to the one, he says, that destroyed the dinosaurs, only this collapse will be economic and social in nature and strictly one of mankind's own making. Much of this he blames on the huge spike in human population beginning with the Industrial Revolution and the concomitant rise in our use of fossil fuels (thus the tie-in to his earlier rant). And as the earth's finite resources, particularly oil, begin to peter out, the end will come for our modern, technology-driven civilization.

He predicts that the FDIC and the Federal Reserve will inevitably become insolvent, which will lead to worldwide chaos and the destruction of whole societies. This movie is entitled ""Collapse"" for a reason, and Ruppert pulls no punches in laying out his darkly foreboding - nay, apocalyptic - view of what we face as a species, which is the complete collapse of civilization as we know it. Indeed, towards the end, he goes so far as to describe this as nothing less than the ""extinction event"" of human society.

His sense of resentment and frustration is palpable as he chronicles how, like a modern-day Cassandra, he foresaw the current economic crisis years before it happened but was not only totally ignored by those with the power and the purse-strings to do something about it but derided as a ""conspiracy theorist"" for his efforts at spreading the news. The proof is in the pudding, he would argue, so he feels no need to debate his point-of-view anymore. His eyes well-up with tears as he thinks about where we're all headed, and he consoles himself with trying to enjoy the little things in life - composing and playing songs, taking walks on the beach with his dog, etc. - as the world comes crashing down around him.

He does provide some ""survival tips"" towards the end, mainly centered on finding one's own piece of arable land and cultivating it with the help of a local community of likeminded survivors. Somehow that's small comfort to those of us who wouldn't know a turnip from a tulip. (For a pop culture reference point, the picture of the world he creates is a bit like the one in ""The Walking Dead,"" only minus the zombies).

The only real solution, according to Ruppert, is to ride out the coming holocaust as best one can, then go about the business of rebuilding civilization from the ground up.

I will have to watch the DVD a few more times while I continue to educate myself on the theory of 'Peak Oil' then come back here to Amazon and adjust my rating accordingly. Was it worth watching? Yes. Was it worth believing? I'm not sure yet. Some of it surely. Maybe not all of it.

One of the claims I found questionable was the idea that oil prices cannot go significantly higher and stay higher. I do believe they can and they will. Demand drops due to affordability may cause the oil price to pull back at times, but other documentaries have shown that the ever increasing world oil demand may totally eclipse any pull back in demand from certain sectors. One documentary claimed that China has so much money they are not overly concerned about how much they have to pay for oil. They will buy it anyway. And because China has more cash than anyone else, well, the price could go higher than many people believe is possible. I guess I do not understand the logic behind Michael Ruppert's belief that oil prices will plateau around $150 and cannot rise significantly higher. The world did not end when oil was at $147. It actually felt like a warm up to even higher prices in the future.

Among many things he gets wrong:

 - Predicts end of civilization as we know it in ""20, 50, 100 years"", even though we have hundreds of years of oil available.  The reality is that over hundreds of years society will adapt to lower consumption levels of fossil fuels.  This will be done seamlessly through all the classic ways in which free markets work.

 - Makes ludicrous statement that the oil sands in Canada ""is not oil.""  It is very much oil, it's just expensive to refine.  Further, output can and will be scaled up based on demand.  Ironically the oil sands are a perfect example of the free market responding to demand through innovation.

 - The reality is that the price of oil has declined drastically over the past 100 years, adjusting for inflation, as a direct result of infrastructure investments and technological advancements.

 - While technically, yes, fossil fuels are used in the construction and maintenance of nuclear power plants, the enormous amounts of energy they produce come from literally converting mass into energy (e=mc2) and as a result are an incredible source for virtually limitless energy that in practical terms is independant of fossil fuels.

 - Regardless of above point, continued economic growth is not even dependant on increased energy consumption as he suggests.  Even if energy becomes scarce (unlikely), both technology and process improvements are continually making us more efficient, able to do less with fewer resources -- in fact this is primarily how wealth is built.

 - Derides ""frankenfood"" which is simply technological advancement making food production more efficient, which actually increases the carrying capacity of Earth, and is a great example of how we're producing more with less.

 - Our banking system does not depend on continued growth.  The supposed endless cycle for more and more loans is simply fallacy.  If that were true then debt levels would be continually escalating which is not what we see in reality over the past century.  Oops!

 - He cited drug violence in Mexico as a sign of his apocalyptic end, however the increased violence is a very direct result of the Mexican president's crack down on cartels.  The more a drug war is escalated, the more violence ensues -- there is solid economic theory that proves this out.  The violence is a result of a failed policy change, nothing more.

 - Predicted the current financial meltdown would be on a scale never seen before, however this recession is no where near the scale of the depression and in fact we've seen worse recessions than this since even the depression.

 - Recommends getting a land line phone as cell phones will stop working, however the back end infrastructure supporting land line phones is exactly the same as cell phones.  The cell towers that our cell phones connect to are only a tiny fraction of our overall communications infrastructure.

He obviously has no clue about technology or how markets work.  I stopped watching about 3/4s in as the claims kept getting increasingly ludicrous.  This film simply feeds the never-ending demand for doomsdayers.

This is a synopsis of all of the green/liberal scare memes of the past two decades, from accusing the CIA of starting the crack trade in Los Angeles to saying we're running out of oil and we've found all of the oil we're ever going to find. Obviously no updates to reflect the huge finds off of the coast of Brazil, etc., or the greatly increased supplies of natural gas, the huge oilfield discovered in south Texas recently, etc. And some of the stuff he says about ANWR are hilarious in their ignorance.

Basically, the premise of this movie is that we're all doomed, so we better move to the country and start practicing subsistence farming... the Cubans are his role models. Sheesh!

Yes, America has some troubles a-comin'... mostly due to stupid policy decisions rather than limited resources. Yes, it just makes good sense to get out of debt, have some emergency supplies on hand, etc. But the country will not totally collapse, nor will we stiff our creditors. The people who are going to get stiffed are the people who expect entitlement programs to be there for them. I agree with the fact that we are going to see more economic polarization: the rich will get richer because when times are tight and you have money, you do proportionally better because you can take advantage of buying opportunities. That also means the poor will get poorer and the middle class will erode further... some will make the jump to wealthy if they manage their money correctly, and the ones who spend every dime and live from paycheck to paycheck will be left standing when the music stops.

If you are a prudent person, then put some of your money into inflation-resistant investments, like gold or other commodities. Buy some emergency supplies. Save enough money to go through six months of unemployment. And pay off your debts. You might want to start taking better care of yourself, too, since healthcare is going to get ever more expensive and hard to get. But we're not going to go all Mad Max Road Warrior anytime soon, even if any of the Max Max movies would be far more entertaining than this train wreck.",1307491200,9,2186,4.684895833333333

COLLAPSE, a DVD starring MICHAEL RUPPERT, is a sane, almost too logical interview, about the consequences of the growing problems of too many people, too little oil, and etc. -- interspersed with archival film footage to illustrate what Mr. Rupert says.  Mr. Rupert is NOT a frenzied radical leftist leader, nor is he a buttoned-down bureaucrat, telling us what is ""good"" for us.  Mr. Rupert is a sane, very wise man, who looks like your nice next-door neighbour.  From experience, knowledge, (both knowledge hidden from the general public which he knows because of his former work in the CIA and as a police officer), and simple common sense, Mr. Rupert reaches several sane, sober, and common sensical conclusions -- which, nonetheless, will scare the h--l out of most people now living the ""good life"" in Western Democracies.  His logic is irrefutable, his conclusions as terrifying as any horror movie you have ever seen -- all the more terrifying because they seem SO very true.  (I did wonder, though, when he was discussing alternative fuels -- and speaking of ethanol, (made from corn), electricity, (which, it seems, comes from our dwindling supply of fossil fuels....as, it is pointed out, most things do) -- why Mr. Rupert did not discuss METHANOL....which is made from garbage.  A mistaken omission?  Or perhaps, it, like ethanol, made from corn, (but which uses more oil to make than it does for substitution purposes), making it, too, is thus a negative-use of energy.  Still, one would have wished mr. Ruppert to discuss methanol, just to be sure.

Whilst watching this DVD on Amazon Instant Video, (before buying my own copy towards the end) -- I found my mind thinking of another man who warned of a coming disaster, though no one would take him seriously.  This was RICHARD RESORLA, chief of security at New York City's World Trade Center, and the subject of the History Channel's EXCELLENT documentary, ""THE MAN WHO PREDICTED 9/11"".

Mr. Ruppert's words are wise -- and frightening.  I look at my great-neice (4), and my great-nephew, (12), and wonder what the future will hold for them.  A life harvesting their own crops so they should have food to eat is NOT what I, or any of their other relatives has planned for them.  Being handicapped myself, I have a wind-up radio, some storable food, stock-piled medicine....and a lot of prayers.
Luckily (?), I have a fair idea of what might, (and what probably will), happen -- to those of us not fortumate (ie: rich) enough, to purchase underground condo-bunkers, (not discussed by Mr. Rupert, but the reality of which are made abundantly clear on episodes of the TV series, 'CONSPIRACY THEORY', hosted by another candidate for ""The Bravest Person In America"" right now -- Jessie Ventura.

But how do I get my sister...and her ex-husband, three children, their wives and chldren to prepare?  Both my sister AND her ex-husband, (with whom she remains on the friendliest of terms), have told me they DO NOT want to hear about ""bad things"".  I asked my ex-brother-in-law if he has ever heard of the story of ""The Three Little Pigs"".  He said yes -- but that he still doesn't want to hear about ""bad things"".

Well, as the French say, ""Chaque On A Son Gout"" -- each to their own taste.  Believe me, I sure wish all of this was just a science-fiction movie -- but I'm realistic enough to realize it's NOT.  My mom calls me ""an alarmist"", and doesn't want to listen either.  Sometimes, I think I should change my name to ""Cassandra""....

Do I play this video for my family?  How do I make them understand the Truth of what's going on?  Sadly, they seem all to have been ""Obatamized"" -- had ""Obamamies"", as it were.  If anything goes wrong it is NOT the fault of the administration -- it is the fault of those ""Evil"" Republicans and Libertarians who water down Obama's sterling legislation, you see.

Well, as my sister well knows, _I_ am one of those ""evil"" Libertarians.  There is so MUCH common sense on this DVD, 'COLLAPSE', that I want to tie my sister and my other relatives to chairs and MAKE them watch it.  But that would be an ""evil"" thing to do, wouldn't it?

How to get others to understand what we are all up against, by watching this sterling DVD, is one of the few things that Mr. Rupert did not, sadly, explain here.",1307404800,2,4987,4.600226500566252

Despite the inevitable collapse these problems are accumulating to, the message Ruppert carries a positive one and it comes from the bottom of his heart. Lot's of analysts predict systemic collapse of the world economic system, only a few explain what you can do to survive the transition time, to free your mind and to always keep hope. His insight is gained through difficult life and fare amount of moral suffering, which makes the content un-offensive for people from different political lines, in my opinion. He is not an ideologue, in fact he states that all the major ideologies are irrelevant and dead in the face of current state of environment.

Examples like yes, Michael Moore's Farenheit 911, Sicko etc. and others like Food Inc. etc.  We as a race have to begin to wake up.  There were so many things I found to be fascinating in this film.

How much empirical evidence is given to fully support Ruppert's thesis? Not much.

And you can't really blame the film; after all, it is advertised as a glimpse into the mind of Michael Ruppert; he himself has stated that he no longer goes into debates, so the movie is actually more an insight into why Michael Ruppert feels so strongly about our imminent collapse. There is not much onus on the filmmakers to clarify, and quantify, the factual evidence supporting his claims.

A remarkable thesis for a popular audience: 5 stars. The emotional appeal, which works to get people such as myself worked up but simultaneously downplays the need for empirical supportive evidence: minus 1 star.",1303776000,,960,4.8121212121212125
4109746,2,B003CJXJ8Q,"""Collapse"" is a interview with journalist Michael Ruppert who is proud of his critical thinking abilities.  He predicts the collapse of the entire world, as we depend on energy, a depleting resource.  He explains how energy is used to make things as well as run things and that we live in a finite world with increasing population and pollution.  Energy is getting harder to find and wind and solar will not take up the slack.  I have heard ""the end is near predictions"" since a small child, so it is hard to always be afraid of something that looms and you cannot do much about if it happens other than getting a balance back with finite earth.  I read the ""Population Bomb"" in the 1960's and the dire prediction came and went.  Ruppert's logic is that we are in a finite world with population growing exponentially and we have lost touch with growing our own food.  He recommends everything local as the new paradigm.  This brings sustainability when our link to energy collapses the global economic system.  The only hope he offers of getting through a crisis of energy depletion is to use your wits for your own local resources, develop closer family and tribal ties to get you through the coming dire times.

4109747,2,B003CJXJ8Q,"I've tried twice to watch this film, and in spite of a great deal of personal interest in the subject matter I can't seem to get past the star of the show (""radical thinker"" Michael Ruppert.)

Some would call this film dramatic because of its ""interrogation style"" setup, complete with darkened room, one chair, spot lighting and the periodic wafting of cigarette smoke - all filmed in grainy black and white. I find it merely annoying. It felt like Ruppert set this thing up in his basement and filmed it himself. At a minimum, it is safe to say that no one fussed over production values. The chain smoking is ridiculous and inappropriate in a contemporary film.

More substantively, if you are new to things like peak oil and its implications, you will get somewhat educated by this film. If you can get past Ruppert.

I do believe in peak oil and the hell that will begin to rain down on us as supplies dwindle over the next decade. Western civilization, particularly the US, is in for a very rough transition. Ruppert does communicate the important messages. However, I think that the messenger, the format and the one-sided, surface level analysis all fall short of what is needed and appropriate in the peak oil debate.

Again, if you are new to the topic of peak oil, it's not a bad place to start. Just prepare yourself for an unbalanced portrait of the situation. And for a very boring experience, the seriousness of the subject matter notwithstanding. I clearly am reacting much differently to the film than those giving it five stars (I give it two). Your mileage will probably vary. If the production values did not suck so badly, I'd probably give this three stars in spite of Ruppert's uninspired and self-centered narration, because the subject matter is so important. As it is, look elsewhere IMHO. This film is a stone skipping across the pond of peak oil. I would like to see deeper content, better ""narration"" and much higher production values.

Peak oil is for real. I urge you to spend the hour and 20 minutes reading about it on the internet. Concentrate on material from petroleum geologists who don't have axes to grind (they are out there, and most are solidly in the peak oil camp). Ruppert is an ex-cop whose primary qualification seems to be a self-ascribed aptitude for ""critical thinking."" He has definitely done his reading, but I don't feel that he brings anything special to the party. He appears to be depressed and emotional, which doesn't help. I found myself craving cutaways to more visually stimulating material ... but those were not forthcoming.

4109756,3,B003CJXJ8Q,"This review is in two parts - my original assessment followed by addendum a week later.

03/08/11

Because I do agree with a lot of the things Ruppert is concerned about, I really resent this ""documentary"", and the iconoclastic Ruppert, for the use of (almost *reliance* on) innuendo and self-aggrandizing language.  This yellow-journalistic approach makes it difficult to know what is fact and what is innuendo.  There is a good deal of both in this DvD.

Ruppert sits in a dark room, he alone is illuminated.  It seems clear the production is trying to give us the *opposite* impression; that of an informant silhouetted in the shadows of a well-lit room!  But this *informant* wants us to know who he is.  What comes across more than Ruppert's warnings is the fact that he enjoys a ""lone hero"" personna.

The ""interviewer"" only serves the purpose of feeding Ruppert open-ended questions that play into Ruppert's hands.  The interviewer never comments, challenges nor validates anything Ruppert says the whole time.  They understand that Americans want a good anecdote more than evidence. This really is an extended monologue, as another reviewer commented.

In one place, Ruppert mentions a particular politician who opposed the oil industry, and in passing he says the politician later died ""supposedly of a heart attack"", or words to that effect. The narration and commentary gloss over this inflammatory remark.  But the implication is that this politician was done away with, and Ruppert is brave for speaking out!  That is the worst kind of yellow journalism, more appropriate to the tabloids or circus side-shows.  And there is lots of it.

Ruppert regularly alludes to himself in terms akin to the beleaguered hero who sees the truth where others dont, in spite of the dangers it might mean to himself or his reputation.  Later, he breaks down in tears, too.  This kind of self-promotion further weakens any validity he may have.

The problem for me is that I tend to think many of his overall concerns are correct, including his judgment of Dick Cheney, George Bush, peak oil, etc. But as a documentary film (which this really is not), and as journalism, this panders to the lowest standards. We must demand a more rigorous presentation of the facts that does not talk to us like poorly-educated gawkers - preferring drama over information.

The factual parts of what Ruppert is saying are in danger of being condemned along with the tabloid self-promotion and innuendo - they must be separated.

I give this DvD 2 stars because the topic is very important and some of the information is accurate.

*** ADDED 03/21/11 ***

It was brought to my attention (see comments) that this documentary was actually intended to show Ruppert's obsession with peak oil, not a ""documentary"" warning about peak oil, per se.  Although it does that somewhat, too.

This video definitely gives you the feeling that Ruppert is obsessed, but the film is not very successful in making the point that his obsession is the real focus.  That being the case, I raised the rating to 3 stars.  I still cannot strongly recommend the video because I think most viewers - and reviewers - have taken this movie to be a documentary warning akin to Al Gore's documentary.",1299542400,14,3248,4.911926605504587

Pros:
This man may very well be the insider he claims, have seen the stuff he claims, and have a hopefully-not-but-possibly-so take on where we are headed. To be fair, he does make some good suggestions about community and accurate observations about the oil peak and some other things.

Cons:
I felt this was a self-aggrandizing, arrogant and nihilistic film.  None of which I liked.  The tears about it all?  What dramatic bull crap. What bothers me the most, though, is he doesn't seem to have faith in either the goodness and fiber of the American people when challenged, nor in human resiliency and intelligence to handle and survive in the face of very real problems.  I also would like to know, it's not stated in the film, what he is doing beyond journalism and this film to educate people for positive grass roots solutions, instead of tossing a package of universal dung in front of us and saying here - clean it up.

Regarding credentials, I fail to see how 'I was a police officer and worked for the CIA' equates to expertise in oil peaks and corrupt economic systems.  We are told he has access to classified info on all of this and 'trust him'. He knows how to 'read' the media and find the 'true' stories the rest of us don't?  Whatever!

He could be right, he could be making some of this up.  The documentary junkie / 'conspiracy theorist'  in me wants to believe him.  The reality-based, analytical thinker in me?  Not so much.

In the end, this is kind of a dark, insider 'Chicken Little-The Sky is Falling' effort.  I hope he's wrong in his conclusions.  He may not be.

But regardless, this film left me feeling very lousy and without hope, and that really wasn't appreciated, even if he is technically correct.

I'm sure he and others who support him might say my review means I'm in denial, that if I don't like this kind of film I can't handle the truth.  Au contraire, ""The Corporation"" is one of my favorite films. I just think he wasn't terribly caring about or kind towards his audience in the way this message was delivered.  At least THAT film went out, researched broadly, had great graphics and solid facts and pushed their envelope just as effectively while showing something other than the creator's faces for 95% of the film.

I mean, it amounts to ""Congrats - Everything you believe in, have worked for and was taught is a LIE, it's all YOUR fault, now GET TO WORK and fix it, and if you're lucky you MIGHT survive"".  That's not very appealing, is it?",1293840000,8,2656,4.485416666666667

He craftily lays out the deep internal rot and decadent that is at the core of our very own government and governments around the world for the uncontrollable drive for more money....... at all costs.  And from their behavior its even at the cost of innocent human lives. All for the short gratification of a piece of paper we call currency that society gave value to above all that is in existence on this great planet that God created for us all to flourish and enjoy.

I salute your effort to speak the truth and challenge the spiritual wickedness in high places.  Nothing can stand agianst the truth.  I hope in the course of this discourse that you, like all spiritual warriors will be standing in the end when the dust settles.

4109767,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"Alarming is not strong enough of a word to describe this documentary.  It is dark and grim, but informative.  With information in one's hands comes the power to make changes and possibly preparation.  It's obvious that due to corporate forces and greed over the past 50 years we are already on a steep decline and roller-coaster ride to an unsustainable lifestyle collectively. Our political and corporate leadership have dug the hole so deep that it is too late to climb out of it... so... that means we have no place to go but down.  We and our children are about to embark on a painful journey of poverty and austerity.  However, with suffering comes change.  Our collective American history/culture of ""rugged individualism"" must and will cease in order for the human race to survive.  Get ready to start becoming more community and locally oriented in regards to transportation, food, health care, etc.

Awesome documentary worth seeing at least twice, first to allow the reality to hit you over the head (lol) then a second time to start accepting the reality, thinking things through and preparing yourself mentally and emotionally for what is about to come and hopefully for the awakening!",1292976000,5,1197,4.95
4109768,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"This is a very good documentary on the coming global economic collapse. Michael Ruppert's account of world events is right on.  In my case, I stumbled on all these information from reading Bible prophecy a couple of years ago. There is even an uglier truth behind all these occurrences. Paul gives us a glimpse of how the world really works: ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."" Ephesians 6:12. However, Jesus also said, ""These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."" John 16:33. Endtime events confirm what the Bible has been prophesying. That is why we know that the Bible tells the truth. God himself gives us the formula to remedy our situation, ""If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."" 2 Chronicles 7:14.

Although, Mr. Ruppert's concern of people who are unaware is commendable and concern about food, energy and survival are important temporal concerns, the more important question is where will we go after life in this world. ""And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."" Matthew 10:28. Another common question is, ""if God is a merciful God, then why does he allow suffering in the world?""  It appears that God has abandoned the world.  But if you look around, it is not that God abandoned us. It is us who rejected him. In our country, the effort to take God away from our schools, from government and from our society is tremendous. We have made God politically incorrect and irrelevant. In taking him out of our lives, we also take away his blessings and protection. Something that the pilgrims prayed for when they reached this country. Even with our rejection, he provides us salvation: ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.""  In times like these, no government, political leader, technology or system can save us. Salvation is found in one name only. ""Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me."" John 14:6.",1292025600,3,2506,4.597315436241611
4109769,3,B003CJXJ8Q,"Decent. The content of the documentary has been covered elsewhere, but it's as interesting a place as any to get information regarding peak oil, financial fraud, etc. In regards to remedies, it's alright too (re-localization, gardening, etc), though there's a richer generation of thought forming now. (To be fair, most people don't share my background in this subject matter, so I didn't discount any stars for this.)

Good. Michael Ruppert's quest to force a rethink will resonate with anyone who has attempted the same. Dismissal by the qualification-toting hacks, the snide remarks of the in-crowd, threatened, cajoled. It's frustrating, it's rough, and it's not for everyone. That comes across in this flick.

Bad.  It's very much over the top at times. The intro referencing the intelligence community was irritating, thinking that Cheney and Rummy were out for him as an individual, and I found myself forwarding through allusions to conspiracy with gusto.",1291680000,2,963,5.322368421052632

4109771,3,B003CJXJ8Q,"Its hard to know what to think about Michael Ruppert.  On the one hand he presents in a compelling and eloquent fashion a frightening apocalyptic vision of the imminent collapse of civilization that make ""Road Warrior"", ""Bladerunner"", and the more recent ""The Road"" more than just fantasy sci-fi imaginations.  Basing his argument on the hotly debated concept of ""Peak Oil"", Ruppert, with obvious conviction, maps out a near term total disintegration of civilization with what appears to be mathematical precision. Anarchy results as financial systems collapse, national infrastructures deteriorate, and finally the food supply simply vanishes.  All of this occurring at worst within 10-20 years but more likely within 50-100 years.  This story has been told before.  What makes this account particularly compelling is that Ruppert uses recent factual examples of what he believes is the beginning of the beginning of this end of days.  And he does so without evoking any religious exegesis.  He offers no solution other than to ""buy gold"", for what purpose isn't clear since you can't eat gold and if the food supply runs out, sitting on a pot of gold doesn't seem to provide much advantage. To be fair he does mention somewhat ad-hoc (as if he just thought about it on the spot), that perhaps you should hoard ""organic seeds"" which to this viewer at least makes sense.

I was convinced enough to pause watching and purchase a kindle version of his book,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossing-the-Rubicon-The-Decline-of-the-American-Empire-at-the-End-of-the-Age-of-Oil/dp/0865715408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil</a>.  Alas, I should have waited until the end, which called into question his veracity if not his sanity.  In the end he relates the infamous ""100th monkey"" parable, but in the guise of a factual account of an experiment performed by the US military on the after-effects of a nuclear explosion supposedly conducted on some pacific atoll.  Unfortunately I was unable to verify this event, and found this on Wikipedia:

""This story was further popularized by Ken Keyes, Jr. with the publication of his book The Hundredth Monkey. Keyes' book was about the devastating effects of nuclear war on the planet. Keyes presented the hundredth monkey effect story as an inspirational parable, applying it to human society and the effecting of positive change. Since then, the story has become widely accepted as fact and even appears in books written by some educators.""

Another bites the dust!  I was hugely disappointed by Ruppert's insincerity.  He is obviously a highly intelligent and impassioned advocate of holding government officials to account.  If only he were as tenacious in holding himself to account!  Nevertheless this is a fascinating account of recent political events with insightful analysis.

4109777,3,B003CJXJ8Q,"I have a few gripes about the DVD, so I'll get them out of the way, because I do think everyone should see it.

I didn't care for the editing and the technical aspects. Camera seemed to be out of place too many times. Then there were these lengthy blank lapses before a new segment began. And as an ex-smoker, I was irritated by the many times Ruppert was shown lighting a cigarette. And all of those grainy B&W films to illustrate the points he made. Finally, he seemed too focused on the loss of oil and didn't discuss many of the other factors that could lead to societal collapse, especially the effects of global warming.

But I still think everyone should see it. I just wanted to lower everyone's expectation so they wouldn't be ticked off by the technical lacks.

The interview with Ruppert is almost entirely about the energy needs of our society and what will happen soon when oil starts to run out. He does mention the financial collapse and what led to it, and how our food supply would be threatened by the collapse of our energy resources,but his primary message is about our total dependence on available and affordable oil products. He apparently has a good record of predicting certain events, so he's not just an uninformed wacko. Even with the shortcomings I mentioned above, at some point it struck me forcibly that most of what he was saying was true. One gets so accustomed to the BS that passes for substance in today's media that Ruppert's message was like a bracing reminder of what I've largely known and believed most of my life, namely that you can't trust most of what passes for truth from corporations, governments or journalists. They all have their own agenda, and it's seldom close to our own.

If this documentary can awaken a lot of people who prefer to go sleep-walking through life, then it's done a great service. If the technical quality was better I'd give it 4 stars at a minimum.",1288051200,,1922,4.578488372093023

The Peak Oil threat in Ruppert's opinion is the biggest threat we're facing.

4109783,1,B003CJXJ8Q,"Ok, I'm a serious guy trying to evaluate serious topics. I find the documentary medium to be just about useless.

They are all the same:
(a) A guy making broad-brushed, scary, unsubstantiated claims with no real, checkable evidence to back it up.
(b) Backed up by tingly, scary music.
(c) Whenever any evidence (numerical or graphical) is presented, the camera pans in and out without giving the viewer a chance to determine what the units are on the axes of the graph much less have enough time to consider its sources or what the graph is saying.

This documentary is just like the rest, only with more obviously not true blanket statements. The part where he's talking about a population collapse being a certainty because of the laws of physics and the 2nd law of thermodynamics is a perfect example. The earth is not a closed system (receiving huge amounts of energy from the sun) so the 2nd law does not apply.

The assumption that the population growth was caused by the use of oil (and that population collapse will follow when oil is not as available) is a clear case of assuming that correlation implies causality.

The dismissal of nuclear power without any reasonable justification is another.

A serious look at the possible scenarios following peak oil is really a valuable subject to address, but this documentary just doesn't cut it.

Probably the most interesting part of the movie is the portrait of Ruppert. Is becoming a grumpy old man something we are all destined to become? Is there a better way to age and still care about what's going on?

4109788,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"Okay, Michael Ruppert smokes too much.  That becomes clear very early in this documentary.  He chainsmokes his way through the program.  Paradoxically, 'Collapse' is a breath of fresh air, illuminating for the public how fossil fuels have become the center of the world as we know it. The documentary is especially powerful in light of the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The reason oil companies are drilling in these dangerous places is simple - the low hanging fruit of 'easy access' oil is already plucked and in order to keep up with demand, companies are now forced to drill in more dangerous (and expensive) locations to find the 'liquid gold' we have come to depend on for everything from plastic wrap, pens and polyester to oil and gasoline.
I came across the program on pay-per-view and was intrigued enough to order it.  Once I saw the program, I knew I would also be buying it, to keep it close enough to watch again and share with friends.  For a program that is essentially a 'talking head' - the makers of the film have produced a highly creative, tightly edited documentary that although spare - is tense and riveting.  'Collapse' does for oil, what an 'Inconvenient Truth' did for Global Warming - namely, it makes you think.  It strips away the illusions we have about oil, its impact on our lives and the coming shortages that seem inevitable given the rising demand from countries like India and China and the depletion of current reserves. There are no easy answers here - but there are many good questions.  And if we are willing to ask those questions and take a long, hard look at where we are, then perhaps those answers will reveal themselves.",1282003200,5,1676,4.657627118644068

He sighs, cries and expounds on at length that, despite all we might do, we are all going to die.

Peak Oil theories are worthy of consideration, but serious consideration comes from clear-headed research and investigation.  In his book, Crossing The Rubicon, Ruppert claimed that  Vice President Dick Cheney, Wall Street and others were conspirators in the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, he authored a newsletter that dealt with conspiracy theories.  Ruppert claims to be ""connecting the dots,"" but the web of conspiracies he conjures from smoke is more the stuff of late night radio than sober investigation.

Well i was pleasantly surprised to see that wasn't the case, in stead you get this Michael Ruppert guy(whom i heard of years ago) sitting telling you frightening things about the worlds economy, the natural resources being used at an alarming rate, global warming and just a general fear of where the world is headed. Oddly enough this was filmed last year in 2009, long before the BP oil spill or some of the other big events going on now. So is he a prophet? No. I find that he is someone who has really done his homework for many many years and just really wants people to know the truth, now i must admit i was leary about this guy knowing that his degree had nothing to do with science, politics or even geology for that matter, but when listening to his comments its quite clear he's done the math. He is definitely a chain smoker, which you'll see in the film as after he is asked a question he lights up as if to say, well the world is so far gone it really doesnt matter if i die of cancer anyways! So he is definitely a down to earth mainstream kind of person. I think when people view this they will realize that the earth is on the brink of destruction, not only from a scientific perspective but on a global scale of oil reserves, which cause war, and also economical chaos, which will cause everything else. The best part is, why did we invade Iraq,(yet again) under the newer Bush campaign, plain and simple, to liberate the country for our own corporate greed, and make the biggest oil reserve in the country available to us. We have built many installations there that are perminent so if you think we are leaving anytime soon, think again. That's all the war is about, nothing more nothing less, especially now with one of the biggest ecological disasters in history on our gulf coast it seems as though these things may even have been planned by members of the CIA, FBI, and even members of the Presidents cabinet. This is something the public will NEVER know, just the same as all the other conspiracies that go on, like 911.

On a final note, this is just a good film to see to make you know we live in a country of blatant deceit and lies. 911 was one of the biggest conspiracies in our nations history and its been proven. Think about this folks, did you ever see any plane wreckage come out of the Pentagon? Did the hole made look even close to the size of a 747 jet? No black box tapes, no huge coverage of it, and also a tape that proves a low lying missile hit the Pentagon, via a Gas Station security camera.

4109795,2,B003CJXJ8Q,"This documentary is basically one guy telling us how the world is going to end from running out of oil. I think for most people, this documentary would be hard to watch. Most of the footage is in some dark basement with Michael Ruppert sitting on a cheap chair, smoking a cigarette. It is a monologue.

The thing is, Ruppert is not completely wacked out. He is right about the phenomena of peak oil. I do not agree with Ruppert in how he thinks the impact of peak oil is going to play out.

Oil wells peak in production rate about when they reach their half empty point, and then the rate that oil came be extracted from the well steadily decreases. This theory was presented by King Hubbert in the fifties. It is now an accepted theory.

What is important to understand about peak oil is not how one well peaks, but how the world aggregate production rate will peak and when. If we got all our oil from one well, and we had no other alternative energy sources, then Ruppert would be right about his predictions. But some wells are on the increase, some wells are on the decrease, and some wells could be on their peak. How the aggregate production rate decreases after the peak is reached, and how fast it decreases will determine how bad things will play out. The thing is, opinions differ wildly on when we will hit peak oil and the rate production rates will decrease. Some say we have already hit it. Some say it will happen around 2020. Some say production will peak and then level off. The thing is, most agree peak oil will happen, if it has not already happened.

Ruppert does not address how we will adapt to peak oil in a fair and optimistic manner. He does not address how we can transition to other fossil fuels like coal for electricity production, and natural gas for transportation. He does not accurately address the potential of clean energy like tidal, solar and wind. There is enough energy just from the ocean to meet our energy demands, but it will not be as cheap as oil to produce. Ruppert does not address how energy conservation will make a big difference. Innovation will make a big difference and we will dramatically reduce our energy consumption because energy will be so expensive. Things like LED lighting is right around the corner. LED lighting will make a huge difference. Telecommuting will become common place. That will make a huge difference. I think hydrogen powered cars are the wave of the future. Hydrogen powered cars are very efficient if you look at the total efficiency of utilizing an energy source. Internal combustion engines are only about 20% efficient. Hydrogen powered cars will make a huge difference and allow use of clean energy. If you are a pessimist, it is easy to look at how peak oil is going to arrive and then cause economic collapse.

We should have plenty of natural gas for transportation needs. Why wouldn't we just combust it for cars instead of extracting hydrogen from natural gas and using hydrogen powered cars? From what I have heard, extracting hydrogen from natural gas and then using in a fuel cell is actually more efficient that directly combusting in an internal combustion engine. It may even be better for carbon emmissions but I'm not sure. That's why I think hydrogen powered cars are the wave of the future, because hydrogen can be produced from a mixture of energy sources.

I am really disappointed though how there does not seem to be an open discussion about peak oil. Why do I have to watch a documentary with some alarmist smoking in a dark room to learn about peak oil. One could argue that peak oil is the most important issue facing Americans. It will happen. We have to adapt. It will take action to change our ways. So we need to wake up. And I wish there would be less videos like Ruppert's, because it makes peak oil seem illegitimate.

Ruppert does try to predict how the future will be after peak oil. He says we will have to grow our own food. In the documentary, he addresses how much energy our agriculture industry requires to produce and distribute food. Growing our own food will not work. Even if you had a great garden, it will only give you certain kinds of foods, with too much production occurring in short periods of time. It will not work during the winter for most. Ruppert misses something that will change. Jet air travel will come to an end. There is no substitute for the amount of power you can get from aviation fuel in a jet engine. Jet air travel will only be for the rich when oil hits $250 a barrel. Propeller airplanes will make a come back.
-- Begin Update 7/13/2010 --
With a little research on the web, I was able to discover the US military is researching alternative fuels for jet engines. They have tested a 50-50 combination of JP-8 jet fuel with natural gas based synthetic fuel. So it seems jet air travel could still be affordable after peak oil.

Peak oil could be one of the best things to happen to America. Millions of jobs will be created in energy production because we will be importing less oil. We will have to produce energy locally. Manufacturing will come back to America due to the energy cost of shipping goods around the world. Peak oil could make America a producing nation again, lowering our trade deficit. I say peak oil...bring it on!",1278806400,6,5396,4.54320987654321

It documents its subject as being self destructive, self indulgent, scatter brained, manic, unable to maintain employment, unable to maintain relationships, pay bills, etc.  Of course he assumes the rest of the world is the same as him and ready to collapse.

As far as presenting any intelligent theory on how the western world is about to collapse, it fails terribly.

His arguments essentially boil down to scan the news for data that validates and reinforces your opinion (bad news).  Then remind everyone that you have been warning about collapse since 1985-- and apparently failed to see all the global growth and benefits that humans have realized since then.

4109797,4,B003CJXJ8Q,"""Collapse"" is one of the most disturbing documentaries in recent years.  Michael Ruppert is a former Los Angeles police officer turned investigative journalist. He predicted the current financial crisis five years ago when he was a faint voice about the real estate and credit bubbles.

The film is an 80-minute interview with Ruppert conducted in what looks like an interrogation room.  Ruppert suggests that we have reached a critical stage called ""peak oil,"" in which infinite growth has come in conflict with limited energy resources.  In a monologue that sounds like the script of a disaster movie, he talks about the catastrophic collapse of civilization, citing facts and figures to strengthen his theory.

There is a sense of cool about Ruppert, captured by director Chris Smith's unflinching camera.  Reactions to Ruppert will differ.  Some will think he's a nut case, others will be impressed at his rational thought processes.  The film is certainly thought-provoking and somewhat scary.  Director Smith has kept his approach stark, so as not to soften Ruppert's message.

Ruppert himself calmly presents his predictions with the assurance of a college professor who knows the textbook far better than the authors.  Not exactly smug, he sometimes comes across as humoring an audience who simply can't see the portents of doom.  Bonus extras include deleted scenes and theatrical trailer.",1278201600,2,1398,5.304545454545455
4109798,1,B003CJXJ8Q,"I made the mistake of watching this DVD last night.  Having read the book by
Jared Diamond, ""Collapse"", I suppose I was expecting a more specific application
of those ideas to the present mess the whole planet seems to be in ... in other
words, a documentary, some documented facts, collected and presented by
someone who knows something.

The man in this documentary just sits in dark room and is hurled questions
by an unseen interviewer, and just speaks his mind pretty much off the cuff.
Apparently we are supposed to believe him or take him seriously because he
used to be a police officer in LA in the 70's.  He says he was offered a job
with the CIA to import drugs into LA and tried to report it to his superiors but
was ignored.  At this point I was thinking this is typical ""conspiracy nut"" stuff.

While he does have a few good points, it would not be hard for me or anyone
else to do the same thing, there are pitifully few facts this man brings to the
this so-called documentary.  You could go down to the local bar and for the
price of the movie or DVD feed any number of drunks a few drinks and get just
as much or more entertainment is that is what you are after.  Very few facts and
very few specifics, and no answers are contained in this movie.

One of the things that really bugged me was that there was no flow, no step
by step presentation and build up to a conclusion, it was a kind of ranting
sermon but without any religious context.

The other thing was the constant pointless profanity.  Its really baffling to
me why they just left certain clips in the movie at all.  Numerous clips would
fade in, the speaker would break out in profanity, and then it would fade
out.  Any real interviewer or documentary would edit those moments out
of a movie, not collect them and concentrate on them.

Obviously there was no script for this, so instead of inserting facts and a
stream of logic they just went with these emotional outbursts from this guy
in the hope that the passion would be seen as authority or sincerity.  I
don't know when a sequence starts up and the lecturer says ""This is
emotional for me"" ... and then cries some tears, then they cut, and come
back at him crying or swearing but filmed from a different angle, I wonder
what is going on?  There were too many of these sequences not to comment
on them, just angry outbursts.

Another thing the movie did was constantly fade to black, and sustain the
blank screen, maybe for some kind of dramatic effect, or maybe to pad the
run time because this person had so very little of value or information to
really deliver to the audience.

""Collapse' was like a collection of You-Tube videos in hi-def strung into
a movie - a complete appeal to emotions by a man who claims all kinds of
expertise or understanding, ie. authority,  a kind of present day Casssandra
talking about doom and destruction.

I feel this movie is a rip-off, and has little to no value in terms of anyone
who would want to find out about the destructive and collective effects of
negative trends like global warming, peak oil, government corruption, etc.

Please do not give you money or you time to support this kind of nonsense.
There is a reason I did not mention the man's name in this review, and
that is because I do not want to help him implant his name in people's
minds to gain name recognition or fame, this movie seems to me to be
just a scam to provide no value and little entertainment, for money.

I have no idea why this movie has so many good reviews, except I do
suspect that they are fake reviews by the production company and their
friends to engage in guerilla marketing to sell this pathetic product.",1278028800,54,3674,4.389380530973451
4109799,4,B003CJXJ8Q,"This is an inspiring movie, about peak oil, peak civilization, peak everything, and the collapse we'll experience as we slide down the other side.

It has been a long time that various people (writers, sages, musicians, scientists) have been warning about the limits of Human growth and hubris. What is amazing is how it all steadily comes to pass and still we manage to continue on. The best analogy is the slow boil of an oblivious, contented frog... it is still not too late to change (I think) but we sure do love the warm water (and it now seems so chilly outside...). Maybe it's possible to change, but as Jared Diamond in his book (different subject, but also titled COLLAPSE) shows, human's historically have been really bad about limiting growth and ecological destruction through self-control. Fortunately we have been good about adapting (necessity being the mother of invention).

This is a well made documentary, high in quality and entertainment value (which is odd considering that for 80% of it we're watching an old guy chain smoke his way through a monologue). Even if you are familiar with the themes, it is good to get a refesher and see once again where you sit on the Kubler-Ross spectrum of stages of grief (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance). But no matter where you currently rest, the truth is that the process continues (externally and internally), and more and more people are waking up to notice the Emperor has been naked for some time. The question is what will you do about it. Like Ruppert, I'm feeling kind of tired and old and foolish for being duped so often. In contrast, my teenage daughter responded with courage and enthusiasm and resolve that her generation will cope, adapt, embrace and enjoy a world with 90% less people...and the way to do that is to make a habit of enjoying the here and now.

I hadn't heard much of Michael Ruppert and the short synopsis I had read made the movie sound more like an uncovering of the oil industry.  But what I ended up walking away with was a sense of responsibility and knowledge.

Collapse presents very real information to you that you can't help but ponder.  It's not done with fear mongering or any other sort of ""shove it in your face"" tactic but rather a long interview with Michael Ruppert, going through our oil dependence, and how if we refuse to do anything about it, we're a threat to ourselves.

It's incredibly well done and you can tell just how emotionally attached Ruppert is to the information he bestows.  You can feel his emotions and that's the main thing that helps to drive his points home.

You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to enjoy this.  You don't need to be anti-government or a live off the grid hippy or anything else.  It's for the average person, helping us all realize what exactly we're doing to ourselves and what will and won't work.

4109803,4,B003CJXJ8Q,"Food supplies are dwindling; oil supplies are tentative and volatile; and populations are increasing along with poverty and greed.  These themes are not new, but Michael Ruppert's projections of world economies teetering on the brink of 'Collapse' are sobering indeed.  Doing his math, we have reached the apex of energy creation and demand keeps growing while supplies are dwindling.  Noting in spades the full force of our energy dependency, Ruppert makes a compelling case that we are all in denial and consumption is out of control.

In a tight hour and twenty-two minutes, filmmaker Chris Smith intersperses relevant footage to go with Ruppert's all too bleak forecast of a near future calamity.

Naysayers may dismiss his authorative testimony as ""Henny Penny"" doom and gloom, but, say, if only a minimal fraction of his forecasts come to roost, isn't this substantative interview/documentary still essential viewing for all?  The media has offered clues of his deliberations:  bread shortages in Egypt, over-fished seas, and Greece's fall into bankruptcy.  Yes, famine, disease, strife, and calamity have always been part and parcel of any age in different measures, but the premise of this film leaves one dumbstruck--with very little to counter--of a very dark age just around the corner where the civilized world may have to work together or face mass destruction. Surely, his thoughtful offering of ""plan B"" couldn't do any harm.

Although extremely bright and compelling, Ruppert's emotional break down in the interview only (subjectively) gives the whole viewing a more cogent appeal.  Ample evidence and film footage flank the substantative deliberations. Scary.",1276732800,83,1676,5.411538461538462

4109806,2,B003CJXJ8Q,"""Collapse"" was directed by Chris Smith based on a book by Michael Ruppert whose views are the subject of the film about the oncoming collapse of all industrial civilization due to finite resources and the economy. Doomsday, here we go!

The movie opens with the statement that while a lot of people talk about needing a president like Lincoln, what is really needed is a Thomas Jefferson since he claimed that every few generations, a revolution is needed internally to change the way people think about their situations. Then the film settles into a format of Ruppert talking in a narrative for the duration of the film with occasional questions to clarify statements from a voice we can only assume is the director.

Ruppert sits in a dark, tiled room chain-smoking cigarettes and affecting many sighs and hopeless looks into the distance to punctuate his remarks. It is all very dramatic and persuasive and easy to see why so many people have been taken in by him. However, one should never rely on one person for all their information on a topic and if you want to know the truth, do your own research on the side. Plus, anyone taking a close like at the man ought to be able to see how unbalanced he can come off as with his big mood swings, but many people have been taken in by this film.

It does not take long to figure out that Michael Rupert is a fear-mongerer and while some of his statements have truth to them, it is difficult to discern at times how he arrived from cause A to effect B and his up and down mood swings make him really unsteady. For example, he keeps running on about how the government will run out of money but does not take into account obvious factors like people paying taxes and the government always creating more debt for itself. He speaks doom and gloom about how terrible young people will have it and worries that today's children won't get to grow up in a civilized society because of the downfall of the economy, environment, energy crisis, and government, but a few minutes later talks about having hope.

Michael Ruppert shoots down the current attempts at alternative energy sources. It's scary and depressing. It takes more energy to MAKE ethanol than to burn ethanol. Electric cars aren't realistic because each tire is made from 7 gallons of oil. There is no such thing as ""clean coal"", he claims due to enormous amounts of energy required for conversion. Basically, everything takes more energy to make than what is created. He claims that the peak of oil production has already been reached and we are in decline with a nine percent reduction rate. The rate is correct, but the reasoning is off since less oil is being purchased because less people have the funds to do it, not because there is less to find at this point. He infers from Saudi Arabia starting offshore drilling that their land resources are tapped, but again the truth is that Saudi Arabia has great demands for oil and people want to make more money so that is why they are trying to get more oil faster. Greed, not scarcity.

By the end of his ranting, he is advocating backyard gardens because everyone will run out of food, saving up gold because all paper money will become worthless and carried around in wheelbarrows to buy a loaf of bread, a revolution and breakdown in the government, and we will all have to work together with our families and neighbors locally to survive. If we try to run away to the woods somewhere with a bunch of can goods, we might get shot by the person already camping out there in their cabin. Anyone taking everything he says seriously could end up having a panic attack watching this.

What makes him an expert? He cites his Bachelor's Degree in Political Science, a job as a cop, thirty years of experience as an investigative journalist, written two books, and several lectures that enable him to scan mainstream news and get to the bottom of the truth of the stories. He speaks with intensity and gets emotional about some of his ideas, but while it is presented in a dramatic, persuasive way, all you have to do is listen and reason it out to figure out what is realistic and what is completely theoretical on his part. Take everything he says with a grain of salt and figure things out for yourself.

Thankfully at the end of the film, it is revealed Ruppert's current state of affairs is his latest book was largely ignored, he started writing music and lyrics, and not surprisingly is behind on rent awaiting eviction.

Bonus Features:

There is a trailer and about 15 minutes of deleted scenes with Ruppert ranting more about 401Ks, Las Vegas, fate, the growing of hemp for fuel and fiber (and getting high, why not? he says), victory gardens and a bunch more.

Also there is a ""Collapse"" update where the director catches up with Ruppert again to find out his take on events since the filming. He says about half of his predictions made in the film have come true. In this 13 minute follow-up, Ruppert looks a little worse for the wear in a appearance and claims that 2010 will be even worse than he originally thought. He is given the opportunity to pimp his books and allude to the truths within that people should seek out and he even gets to plug his band, [...] and his sustainability movement, [...].",1274918400,20,5271,4.5741525423728815
4109807,5,B003CJXJ8Q,"To understand the depth of emotion in Michael Ruppert's fascinating argument is to understand his personal evolution.  Ruppert was born in Washington, D.C., the son of an Air Force officer and an later aerospace executive. Ruppert's mother was a cryptographer for Army Intelligence at Fort Myer, VA, during the Second World War.  In addition, his father's cousins were employed by, and retired from, the Central Intelligence Agency.

Ruppert was a hopeful idealist and raised as a Republican.  He excelled in his studies at UCLA (receiving honors in political science), interned for Chief Edward Davis of the Los Angeles Police Department, and eventually became a highly decorated LAPD officer.

Ruppert had all the makings of helpful cog in the wheel of the status quo.

Only later, as a narcotics officer, did Ruppert's journey lead him on a path of discovery which clearly illuminated the chasm between truth and the government approved appearance of truth: In 1977 Ruppert claims to have discovered a major drug trafficking operation run by the CIA.  Ruppert filed a statement with the CIA and famously made a publicly televised challenge the Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch.  Deutch responded by agreeing to investigate and address the issue earnestly.  This promise, in Ruppert's mind, was not honored as nothing was done to identify and punish those who ran the operation.  Moreover, nothing was done to cease the drug trafficking operations.

From this experience the audience can understand the evolution from Ruppert's youthful idealist belief in justice toward his lifelong passion for exposing the hidden ""truths"" that are conveniently hidden from public consumption. (Complicit in this deception, Ruppert argues, is a lazy and uninterested mainstream media.)

Those who have neither read Ruppert's books, viewed his blog, or seen him speak will be riveted as he breaks down the imminent perils of peak oil, the fraud of fiat currency, the quiet revolutions taking place with no media coverage, the corporate and government corruption run a muck, the need for sustainability, and, thankfully, the importance of happiness, joy, and smiles in one's life.

Poignant moments of the film:
During a fascinating scene in the film, one which should not be overlooked, Ruppert himself betrays some his own words.  Moments after coldly declaring that his only intent is to protect himself from what he later describes as an avoidable ""holocaust"", he becomes emotionally overwhelmed and asks for a cut in taping while he attempts (in vain) to recover his emotions and hold back tears.  Those tears, of course, appear and one can immediately see that the man who seems to be so removed from the the deadly consequences that face the entire human race is, indeed, not completely calloused to the thought of inevitable human suffering.

Later in the film, when challenged by an off-camera voice to explain why he continues to speak up to this day, Ruppert proudly boasts that as a man of principle he could not walk away and silently ignore government crimes.  The implication is that the beneficiaries of Ruppert's activism are his fellow citizens.

Another moment in the film sees Ruppert pausing for a moment when weighing a thought that seems to evolve and fully germinate in front of the camera.  Discussing President Obama, Ruppert makes the assertion that the President has neither the level of executive control nor power-broker support to make the type of changes that could halt crises of peak oil, fiat currency, et al.  In other words, those who are blindly waiting for President Obama to fix the worlds ills are going to be extremely underwhelmed with the results.

Conspiracy and Paranoia:
My late father once told me during my most fervent period of Patriotic Idealism (middle through late teens) that many of the people who are classified today by the media as ""crazy"" or ""paranoid"" will someday be proven right (at which time the media will offer no update or correction to their previous claims).  Sadly, at the time he spoke those words I did not understand my father's wisdom.  Since that day I've noticed the lies, deception, and corruption perpetrated by our government (and all governments) as well as from the entrenched wealthy elite.  Yes, Ruppert is one of those voices to whom my father was referring.

Everyone you love should see this film.  (Everyone whom you do not love should also see it ... but lets be real.)  This is a powerful voice of a debate that needs to take place, in public, beyond the limitations of the ""conservative/liberal/right/left/red state/blue state"" paradigm. We would all do ourselves justice by listening to his words and preparing ... if only for the sake of our children.

However, I have pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon.

8394292,4,B003CJXJ8Q,"Michael Ruppert is well-known to people well-accustomed to spending too much time on the internet as a familiar voice of support and confirmation to a wide variety of ""conspiracy theories.""  While not exactly a crowd that one should endeavor to be associated with, I will say, to his credit, that he is one of the more reasonable members of their ranks.

In this film he delves into the issue of Peak Oil, the general idea that at a certain point oil production will hit a high mark which it will never surpass.  After sustaining this high point, or at least something comparable to it, for who knows how long, production will begin to decline until eventually the resource is exhausted.  This should seem obviously true:  oil is a finite resource, and if we never stop using it, we will eventually run out.  The relevant point he makes is that this state of affairs is immanent.  We are running out of oil.  To a world heavily dependent upon oil for everything from plastics and gasoline to toothpaste and various agricultural products, this would be devastating.  Combined with extremely reckless economic practices, he envisions a total economic and social collapse, i.e. the breakdown of modern society into chaos and degradation.

I think that Ruppert read the cultural tea leaves correctly in making this film.  At the time, gasoline was over 4 dollars per gallon, the entire planet was in some form of economic recession, and pessimism was high.  People were ready to hear this message.  Obviously though, the planet did not devolve into chaos and madness and degradation, and the mere fact that perhaps someday it could does not exonerate the fact that something he claimed to be immanent never came to pass.

As someone well-acquainted with Peak Oil, I take it as an axiom that we will only know we hit it in hindsight, quite likely in distant hindsight.  I for my part thought that we had hit it in 2010.  But, advances in drilling technology, fracking, and a slowdown in consumption of oil (most of the world has not yet recovered from the Great Recession) has meant that we have more than enough oil to last us for at least another 10 years, probably a little bit more.  However, even if that 10 years turns out to be 30 or 40 years, that is not a permanent solution.  So long as we keep using a finite resource, it is just a matter of time before we run out of it.  It's just a question of ""when"" at this point.  And the financial hazards that he describes which serve to compound the precariousness of the situation are still very much a source of concern.  Thus, insofar as the film calls attention to these issues, it is laudable.  However, insofar as it uses these issues to stoke fear and consequent Mad Max type scenarios about how everything is going down the drain any moment now, I think it is somewhat alarmist.  He actually entertains, seriously, a scenario wherein the economy collapses all over the world, all governments collapse and cease to exist, and neither of these two ever recover, more or less forever.  That's not just cynical, that's nihilistic.

I'd also like to mention several of his claims that seem, shall we say, less than likely to be true:

1. That his father and other relatives had top secret access to intelligence that was somehow conferred unto him as well.  The innuendo just feels false.  He doesn't come right out and say he has top secret clearance, but he clearly wants you to think that he does.  I'm inclined to think that he does not.

2.  That his once-fianc was a CIA plant designed to lure him into illegal operations involving drug smuggling that was being orchestrated by the CIA (imagine what it takes for a man to reach such a conclusion about someone he once loved).  He claims that once he refused their designs ""She disappeared and people started shooting at me.""  But apparently they stopped, because here he is, alive and well.  Just stop and imagine how it would play out if what he is claiming was actually true: The CIA wanted Mike to smuggle drugs, so they hire a beautiful woman to pretend to date and wish to marry him over a period of many months just so she could sweet talk him into it?  Couldn't they just offer him an attractive benefits package?  Paid time off?  It just sounds silly.

3.  That ""Richard Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld took an intense personal interest in me and what my newsletter was publishing for all the years of the Bush Administration.""  I would be shocked if either of these men had even heard the name Michael Ruppert, let alone that they felt compelled to comb through his newsletter.  It sounds much closer to paranoid delusions of grandeur than anything else.

4.  That his newsletter ""From The Wilderness"" counted many members of Congress as loyal subscribers.  I'm guessing that either some terribly dedicated conspiracy theorist signed up his local Congressman against his will to receive the newsletter, someone lied to Mike and told him he was a Congressman and he reads the newsletter even though he actually works at Burger King and struggles to read anything at all, or it just never happened.  And what would it prove even if it was true?  And why would he want it to be true?  If he's uncovering all these hidden truths that the powerful elite don't wish to be uncovered, why would he be glad that they wished to be kept aware of all developments?  Wouldn't flying below the radar be a bit more prudent?  The most likely explanation is that it is another delusion of grandeur.

I don't want to be too negative.  The fact that he has drawn attention to the very real and important issue of Peak Oil is laudable.  That his thinking on the issue is largely accurate is also laudable.  It's just important to take the whole experience with a grain of salt.  But, be that as it may, if it draws attention to this so very important issue, then I am more than happy to oblige and take that grain of salt.",1476576000,2,5913,4.6130268199233715
