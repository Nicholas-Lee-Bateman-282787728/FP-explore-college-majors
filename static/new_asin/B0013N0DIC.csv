8252304,5,B0013N0DIC,"We bought this set of DVDs from Costco when our grandson was an infant. The music is sometimes soothing, sometimes playful, sometimes moving. He loved them. As he got older he'd ask for them to be played over and over. Now he's 7-yrs-old and he watches them from YouTube from his iPad, but he still pulls out the DVDs now and again and puts them in the player. Those characters are like old friends. And each time I hear the opening Baby Einstein music I know the money for these DVDs was well-spent because of the hours of enjoyment he's gleaned from each DVD.",1399593600,,561,4.403846153846154

8252306,5,B0013N0DIC,"My little grandson LOVED these DVD's.  Though as a little one of just around 8 months, he had a limited attention span, they definitely captured his attention and he grew with them.  We could see a definite interest in him for the DVD's.  Good help for the little ones.  As a retired therapist and a grandmother, I would recommend them for enrichment and a bit of stretching of little minds that are eager to expand.",1381968000,,416,4.506666666666667
