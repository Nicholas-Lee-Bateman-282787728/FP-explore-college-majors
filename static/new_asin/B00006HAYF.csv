1756894,3,B00006HAYF,"I'm talking about the subtitled version here. Of course, I may be a little biased (seeing it was one of my first experiences with anime, I was 10 when I saw it, and Katsuhiro Otomo did the character design), but Harmegedon  wasn't nearly as bad as everyone claims it is. The animation was excellent  for the time period and is effective at creating a moody atmosphere. We're  talking about the early eighties here, and it still looks better than many  productions today. The plot, if somewhat familiar (""Troubled,  introverted teen gains telekinetic powers""), is fair if a little silly  at parts, and is not so far removed from other Japanese productions. Taro  Rin, one of the best directors in anime, does his job well. So what's  wrong? Well, the character development (except for Jo) was a bit wanting.  The ending was somewhat predictable and wrapped up in a bow. The other  espers were mostly stereotypes (the wise old yogi, the tall, dark, silent  Native American, the 10-year-old black American crimelord) and weren't at  all developed, excepting, perhaps, for a small degree, Sonny Lynx (how come  so many American gangsters are named Lynx in anime?). Other than that,  there's not much to complain about. These people who say it's the worst  anime they've ever seen probably haven't seen much. Harmegedon could've  been a LOT worse.",951868800,12,1342,4.924107142857143

7968681,5,B00006HAYF,I've been looking for this movie for years after I had seen it years ago on IFC. Definitely a must have for any anime fan's collection.

The story is disjointed, and goes off in directions that never lead anywhere.  Wish I could give it more stars.",1385683200,,258,4.354166666666667
7968683,1,B00006HAYF,"Some anime defies classification. How could you possibly begin to describe something that subverts genres and tropes such as ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", or to put together the pieces of the puzzle formed by ""Serial Experiments Lain""'s often outlandish narrative? Yet, as a critic, it's a fun challenge to put together insight and opinion in such a way that accurately describes a work, while simultaneously offering criticisms and compliments of it. However, ""Harmageddon"" is undoubtedly one of the biggest reviewing challenges of my entire career. Not because it is particularly profound or thought-provoking, though. This early 80's film may, in fact, be the single worst piece of animation vomited up by the anime industry, and one struggles to find anything good to say about it.

Whatever plot is here revolves around a psychic girl who meets a boy, and begins to relay to him a threat that may very well destroy the world. In order to stop it, they must work together and team up with a group of psychic children in hopes of defeating this menacing evil. If you're looking for more, well, you're out of luck. This threadbare and trite pith is about all you're going to get from this movie, which is sad, considering that it's adapted from one of the most profound works of Japanese science fiction. You wouldn't be able to tell that, though, with how little is going on, and how much it's padded out with long expanses of horrendous dialogue and pointless action.

Everything here is truly abhorrent, an abomination to every type of genre it tries on. Awkward attempts at humor, forced romance, treacly environmental messages, absurd supernatural elements... truly, the writer has defecated on every single they tried to make work. Emphasis on ""tried."" Put all this together in a nearly three hour

The faults don't stop here, though. Oh, no. Madhouse, one of the most wonderful studios in Japan, must have made this with the smaller remaining budget of another, larger project back in the day, because everything here is positively terrible to look at. Stilted movement in the action sequences ends up making the original ""Speed Racer"" seem like a high-octane thrill ride by comparison, and character designs are so dated that I almost expect somebody to say ""tubular."" That's not even touching on the fact that, for the most part, characters don't even move their lips when speaking. Supposedly, this is because they're telepathic, but let's be honest here and just say that it's one of the stupidest excuses for not wanting to animate lip flaps ever put into ""animation."" If you could call it that.

If you were hoping for a nice, cheesy soundtrack that you could at least laugh at, then you're out of luck as well. There is no safe haven from the sheer, awe-inducing badness of this shlock. Most of the score comes from famed British musician, Keith Emerson, who according to the director (in the commentary) was either drunk or high while recording pretty much all of the music. It shows, to put it bluntly. Horribly implemented synthesizers drive some of the most dated music this side of an 80's cop show, except ten times as incoherent and messy. The voice acting is also total garbage, barely matching up with whatever lip flaps there are. And just when you think it can't get any worse, the English dub comes out of left field and sucker-punches you in the gut.

I wish this film were some of parody, some ironically awful stroke of brilliance. Alas, it is not. Nothing about this film is enjoyable. Whatever mocking laughs can be derived are worth sifting through over two hours of this cinematic garbage. It never crosses the boundary of ""so bad it's good."" No, this movie is not that lucky. Instead, it transcends ""bad"" into a sort of awfulness that cannot be defined. It's trashy, poorly plotted, somewhat racist, cheesy, trite, and about two dozen other degrading pejoratives that I simply don't have the space for.

The fact of the matter is, though, that ""Harmageddon"" is an awful, steaming pile of a film, and is not worth paying any amount for. In fact, it's not even worth watching for free. In fact, it's not even worthy of its very existence. Many Central Park Media titles have gone up in price after the bankruptcy of the revered 90's establishment. This is not one of them, and that fact alone sums up how enthused people really were about a ""20th Anniversary Edition"" of this film.

7968684,4,B00006HAYF,"I watched this movie years ago in its original Japanese with English subtitles.  Before I decided to buy it and take a trip down memory lane, I read the reviews here and was somewhat taken aback.  I definitely did not recall it being as bad as some other reviewers described it. But once I got the DVD, I got a better understanding of what people were unhappy about.

First thing--Keep in mind that this movie was made in 1983.  The artwork is great for its time, but it's unrealistic to expect it to hold up to something more modern like Fullmetal Alchemist.

Second thing--The DVD comes with various language options.  I have to agree that the English version is quite bad, but watching it in Japanese with English subtitles is definitely enjoyable.

Third thing and perhaps the most important--it has a story that would be the precursor for many future anime stories, both in terms of artwork and storyline.

I am not disappointed that I purchased this DVD.",1320710400,,960,4.6726190476190474
7968685,2,B00006HAYF,"Okay, this is my 3rd and final try to review this title. Hopefully it sticks THIS time. I'll cut to the chase:

1) Harmagedon and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Genma-Wars/dp/B0000JLLA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Genma Wars</a>&nbsp;are SEPARATE titles, as far as I can discern from available online resources... They follow different plot lines and characters, but may be derivative works from the same original Japanese novels? They share an antagonist named Genma. That's about it. This review pertains to Harmagedon, NOT Genma Wars.

2) The plot is so-so. The usual ""kid develops psychic powers / must save the world from the evil being from space"" schlock that some other series/movies use.

3) The animation may be from the 80's or a very good knock-off. In my opinion it didn't age especially well. It looks campy, stereotypical in just about every respect, and uses at least one but maybe more repeated cut scenes. One or two of which take place in the ""final battle."" That really doesn't play well.

4) Character development? What development? Most characters are just dumped on the viewer all at once with no explanation. Remind me why we're supposed to care when they all team up at the end? There's one main character the rest are just useless fluffy filler.

5) Watch just about anything else. Really...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spriggan/dp/B000767QRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spriggan</a>, I liked.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>&nbsp;is a classic.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell/dp/B0002RQ2T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell</a>&nbsp;is a ""new classic.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Scroll/dp/B0000B1OE7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Scroll</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrath-of-Ninja/dp/B000GAKLZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrath of Ninja</a>&nbsp;do fighting better.

I guess what I'm saying is money can be better spent on one of the othertitles just mentioned.

7968686,5,B00006HAYF,"Yup I gave this 5 stars, deal with it. Yes, this show has horrible animation. Very bad, I agree completely, especially considering when it was produced. However, the I felt was one of the most wonderfully complex and multi-layered stories I have come across in an anime. I've never put too much emphasis animation, although I do enjoy great animation direction, but I can overlook it in some cases including this one. I wish more anime fans could do that instead of being obsessed with how technically advanced the animation is. Obviously this isn't for your run of the mill, immature anime fan who just wants an instant pay-off with flashy animation, instantly relatable characters, and spoon-fed plots. This anime I felt is good because its based on very good source material, and that is why I give it 5 stars. These 5 stars I give less for the producers of the anime and more for Shotaro Ishinomori and Kazumu Hirai who were two of the most brilliant and creative minds that crafted some of the most wonderful stories in fiction. Ishinomori, in particular I consider one of the 3 most important manga-ka in history. This anime is based on Ishinomori's interpretation of Kazum Hirai's Genma Taisen novels. I'm not sure which ones though, since no information is available on them in English. The Genma Taisen series of novels is reportedly incredibly long, having started in the 60's and still ongoing today. The story is said to be one of the most complex and multi-layered sagas ever put to word. This anime relates one of the chapters it this story that follows the lives of the twins, Loof and Jin. I won't go into spoiling the story for you, but subtitle of Eve of Mythology is a good one, because I do believe this is a grand story of mythic proportions. Obviously though, this wasn't the best execution of this story possible with the very badly executed animation, but I still appreciate it much. Perhaps, they had very little budget for animation, but I am grateful I got to witness this story because the Genma Taisan novels and manga probably have a very small chance of making it over the US any time soon. You could defiantly argue it wasn't great, but giving it one star and completely writing it off is just immature and disrespectful. I also feel complaining about the style of the character designs is utterly idiotic. These are the original style of the character designs from Ishinomori's manga. Ishinomori was an apprentice under Osamu Tezuka and his character designs are very similar to Tezuka's. This is the style that all other character designs, including your favorite shows, evolved from. Despite the flawed animation, I enjoyed this show a lot. I suggest picking up the cheap 4 disc collection, which at some places can be found for as low as $23. Also check out Harmageddon which was based on the same series of novels and manga that Genma Wars is based on. However, Harmageddon may be more to the liking of most otaku due to the brilliant animation direction of Rintaro.",1090627200,4,3003,4.732824427480916
7968687,5,B00006HAYF,"I enjoyed this film emensely.  Its a great science fiction story from Kazumu Hirai's very long and fabled series of Genma Wars novels.  The direction from Rintaro in this film is excelent and visionary.  Katsuhiro Otomo's character designs also give this film a nice touch.  Hamragedon is the americanized name though.  Its real name is The Battle With Genma (or perhaps simply Genma Wars).  This film was highly influential in Japan, especially for its realism, and it is considered a landmark among many otaku and those in the industry.  The anime tv series Genma Wars is also based on the same novels (and manga by Shotaro Ishinomori), which I also liked dispite extremely low budgeted animation.  If only that series had the animation and direction of this film.  This special edition DVD is also a very nice package, with a good, remastered transfer, aswell as a very interesting commentary by Rintaro.  Highly reccomended.",1090627200,6,928,5.006535947712418
