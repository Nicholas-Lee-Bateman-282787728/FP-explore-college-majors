8240197,5,B00113X71Y,"Ever wonder what mortician's do? Embalming is one aspect of their job, but what if the decedent has been in an accident, has died a violent death, or has some disfigurement? This silent film is a look into restorative art techniques. Although a 1938 documentary it's a valid testimonial as to the artistic talent that every good mortician must achieve. You will witness amazing reconstructive techniques that restore a very damaged person back to  an almost human like appearance. The silence in this movie forces you to focus on the subject matter. You won't take your eyes off the screen once you start to watch this. Not for the faint at heart, it is graphic, educational and a testimonial. Mortician's do not have an easy job, walk a mile in their shoes and you will see what I mean.",1201996800,14,787,4.661870503597123
