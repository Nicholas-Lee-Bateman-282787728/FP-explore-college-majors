I highly recommend!",1400630400,,131,4.739130434782608
8415846,5,B00445VIP8,I like this DVD because it practically teaches children about obedience to God. It actually deals with real situations that children face.  My children used to love Quigley's Village and now my grandson is loving it too.,1399852800,,220,4.945945945945946
8415847,5,B00445VIP8,"Grew up watching this movie - it's a great, wholesome, childrens movie with good learning principles.  As an adult, it definitely appeared cheesier than I remember - but what kids movie isn't? I never noticed those things when I was a little one :)  definite must-have to the collection.",1358380800,,287,4.836734693877551
