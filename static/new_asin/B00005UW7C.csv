7955577,5,B00005UW7C,"A great finish to the hilarious comedy, Those Who Hunt Elves. Three people from another world (ours) are accidently summoned to the elven world. Them and a T-74 tank. To get back home, they must find the five fragments of the spell that can take them home. Too bad the fragments are on the bodies of female elves!
More of the same hilarity, language, and elf-stripping as in Volume 1, this time with a conclusion. Bottom line: If you loved the first one, the second one is a must!",1014163200,5,480,4.404494382022472
7955578,5,B00005UW7C,"One of my favorite animes out there, and i'm glad the conclusion (this DVD) is finally out! I preordered this and got it two days after it came out. woo!
Anyway, it's the second half of the first DVD...which is great cuz there's 12 eps each, making 6 eps per DVD!
In this edition, they continue their pilgrimage to strip the elves and there's still some of the same humor as there was in the first. However, there's some serious notes in a couple eps. If you connect with the characters, there are some  tear jerkers in here but at the same time there are amusing aspects such as Junpei-kun making fun of the anime itself.
I don't want to put any spoilers in here, so i'm not going into details. It's a nice conclusion to a hilarious series.
My favorite ep. was ep. 6, with the demonic  stuffed animals...but now i have a new one: Ep. 8...where they take on astral projection!
The jokes can be a bit adult filled, but they're not anything you don't hear on the streets, and there aren't really any situations, i can think of off hand, where a kid would have to look away. About the worst is a little blood being shown. Other than that, i'd show this to my 8 yr. old Nephew; cept he would either have to learn Japanese or learn to read really fast. The dubbed is okay, but...it's still dubbed.",1014163200,7,1292,4.31275720164609
