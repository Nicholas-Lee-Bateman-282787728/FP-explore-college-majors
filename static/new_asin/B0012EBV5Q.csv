8245467,1,B0012EBV5Q,"I ordered this DVD, but it was later cancelled by Amazon.  Of course I was dissappointed.  I ordered the DVD because I wanted it and it was advertised as available when I did so.  Amazon collected my money, but then turned around and cancelled the DVD....they DID refund my money, but in the meantime, I found another source for the DVD which I passed up because I THOUGHT I had already bought it from Amazon.  When Amazon cancelled my order, I went back to the other source....but too late...it was gone....
I give Amazon 1 star for at least returning my money. NO STARS for a DVD I never got!!!",1241136000,,596,4.390909090909091
8245468,5,B0012EBV5Q,I loved this video... LOVED IT!!  He is hilarious and had me laughing from the very beginning!!! Can't wait to see another DVD of his soon... And I hope to hear that he is coming to a comedy club or theatre in my area very soon!!,1223251200,,229,3.9782608695652173
8245469,2,B0012EBV5Q,"I am absolutely stunned at the number of five-star reviews here.  Given that Mr. Downey himself has posted a review of his own material, I wouldn't be surprised if at least some of the five-star reviews were from associates of his.  The only other explanation is that the reviewers are kids whose only exposure to stand-up has been Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia.

I have no problem with 'character' comics (I love Steven Wright and heck I can even tolerate Judy Tenuta and Goldthwait), so it's not just the acting-a-bit-tipsy schtick this guy does that's cause for my poor rating; it's the fact that, well... he's just not that funny.  I laughed a few times, to be certain (which is why I didn't give it one star), but not enough times in the 45 minutes to have been worth my time.  I found myself reaching for the remote to see how much longer this hit-or-miss (mostly miss) routine would go on a mere 12 minutes in.  The *only* reason I stuck it out and watched the rest of it was so that I could give an accurate review here to counter the obviously-skewed rating that led me to check this thing out to begin with.  To be honest, I may have failed a bit in that regard, as I wandered around doing household tasks for the last 10-15 minutes of his routine:  it simply could not hold my interest.

Drug/alcohol comedy has been done by many much more funny comedians than Mr. Downey.  I'd venture to say he is more rightly simply a ""joke teller"" than a true comedian.  Nothing to see here.",1214870400,2,1487,4.410256410256411
8245470,5,B0012EBV5Q,"Not only is Kevin a comedic genius, but he's also super sexy and a great dresser!  LOL! I have seen him in person a million times and will see him another million if I can.  With his own DVD (finally!!!) everyone who hasn't had the opportunity of seeing him on stage will get the chance to experience this great talent!  I love this DVD and it gets funnier and funnier every time I watch it! Is funnier even a word.....?  For Kevin it should be!  siiiiiiiiiiip!",1213315200,,461,4.313953488372093
8245471,5,B0012EBV5Q,"My husband and I were still laughing about some of the jokes during the day after watching this, which is a true test of a great comedy...memorable lines. Kevin delivers a funny skit with subtle mannerisms that don't distract from his punch lines. Not for the viewer who likes clean jokes of course, but fantastic for those who like a little raunchy mixed in with their comedies.

8245472,5,B0012EBV5Q,"Where has this guy been hiding?  This video is side-splitting hilarious - really one in a million.  This isn't the last we'll see of him, I'm sure.  Could Everybody Love Kevin?  I think they could....",1207094400,5,200,4.628571428571429
8245473,5,B0012EBV5Q,"Hey Kids,
  I would have titled this DVD almost anything else, but it was out of my hands.

That said, I just gave myself 5 stars.
