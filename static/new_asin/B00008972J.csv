I have devised a drinking game....watch a bunch of Scott Bakula movies and drink a shot everytime he takes his shirt off.  Be loaded at the end of the night. lol.",1459555200,,250,4.434782608695652

7980116,5,B00008972J,"I especially liked this movie. Scott Bakula plays Nick who marries Mama, played by Elizabeth Perkins. I could have easily fallen in love with Nick who reminded me of my own husband who loved me and supported me thru two cancer surgeries. I would have liked to have seen Tilden mellow out a bit more, but overall, the movie is a beautiful story.",1419465600,,344,4.476190476190476

7980119,5,B00008972J,"This is a story of extraordinary and extravagant love and what can happen when they are both applied to life. The responses to this movie define the observer. Some see a somewhat flakey woman (Perkins/Frances) who turns her daughters' lives upside down to satisfy her own quest for love.  Others see a spoiled, sullen thirteen-year-old who cannot accept that life does not revolve around her and doesn't go ""her way""(Pill/Tilden). Hardly seen is the younger sister who seeks solutions to life as she experiences it and is more open to answers and questions(Hope/Elizabeth). And then there is Nick(Bakula).
  Frances is a woman living a life of ordinary existence divorced and raising two girls. She has not, however, allowed her circumstances to steal her dream of what life can be-surprising, fun, what you make it, an adventure.  She knows how to love without prejudice and knows it is ""out there"" somewhere if she will risk it. She believes she has found it in a long distance romance (Georgia to Long Island). It's noteworthy that it is discovered through letters and not an ever-present other.  She risks it all and uproots her family to follow her heart. Something her daughters neither understand nor desire.
  This is a story of great discoveries.  The daughters discover how extraordinary (and rare) extravagant love is. It is worth throwing everything else away,especially surface appearances. Frances discovers that her risk costs much more than she thought. Happily ever after is not easily achieved, but it is attainable.
  Enter Nick(Bakula), a quiet man who can, at times, nearly become invisible. He's not prince charming, not a romantic poet, but lives quietly, elegantly, a life of extravagant love.  He loves Frances better than even she understands.  His love doesn't stop with her, it extends to her daughters, the boy who works for him, even his quirky dispatcher.  Bakula's superior performance sets the standard for male romantic leads so high that anyone who loves deeply recognizes why it is so very rare. You don't need much background or dialogue from Nick to recognize who/what he is if you know what to look for.
  There is not a poor performance in this movie.  Each character is fully defined and well presented by the actors. This movie is now one of my favorites because it causes me to examine how I love . . .",1339545600,2,2345,4.928753180661578
7980120,4,B00008972J,"Look, I like movies about football and sports just like any other guy. But this movie is so well acted by youngsters who later become top stars in their own right---and Elizabeth Perkins' super performance as a quirky mom---I loved it.  Good actors make good movies. This story-line is based upon Karin Cook's first novel and it's full of humor,fun, sadness and interesting characters. Also, it tells the story about a guy who didn't run away when things got tough. (Yeh, there are good guys out there.) Watch it with your family, but have some kleenex on hand for your unwaring female co-watchers.",1295654400,,598,4.805825242718447
7980121,5,B00008972J,"A seeringly powerful yet tender tale about the turmoil that young women often have to cope with. Wonderful performances by a young cast and even grander performances by the adults. Elizabeth Perkins and Scott Bakula have wonderful on screen chemistry.
Based on a true story, What Girls Learn, is 'almost' a chick flick.  A strong and outspoken woman with two daughters falls in love with a man who changes their lives only to meet with tragedy. Yet, despite the 'down' parts, there is great humanity here. Can't imagine a dry eye in the house.",1067817600,7,543,4.776595744680851
7980122,2,B00008972J,"The 3 leading ladies had no chemistry what so ever, even when the 3 dare share a bubble bath. The oldest daughter Tilden was the most hateful and unlikable girl I have ever seen. Not one convincing smile crossed her bland face. The lack of chemisty however had nothing to do with actress Elizabeth Perkins who is always a joy on screen. Also Scott Bakula was good too. It all boils down to heavy handed melodrama at it's dullest.",1061337600,5,429,4.443037974683544
