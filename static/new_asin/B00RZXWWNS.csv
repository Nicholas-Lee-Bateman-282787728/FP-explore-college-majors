He is a very nice guy who seems to get run over a lot and treated like trash. He has a crush on the girl who lives in the apartment beside him, but she has the abusive boyfriend who can care less about her. He has a job it seems that his boss lays the work hard on him waiting for him to fail so she can fire him. He cannot go anywhere it seems without someone messing with him it seems. So one night, he makes a deal with his personal demon that lives inside him. He wants the girl next door, he wants popularity and he wants to be successful. Well, the demon comes out of his back and decides to right the wrongs that Cyril feels has been committed to him. This is a very low budget and very imaginative little horror film. The main emphasis of this film is fun.

This film always makes sure that the audience is entertained and at least getting a smile. The kills in this film are very fun, there is a death that involves paper cuts that was very well thought out. For me, I felt the weakness of this film comes in the last 15 minutes. The premise is intriguing and the execution for the most part is smart, but you had to know this film thought long and hard about how to end the film. I felt the route they chose was flat. The low budget negatives really shine in that sequence of events that get us to the credits. The acting in this film is what you would expect, I mean the cast seemed excited and eager enough to give this film the fun it needed. Like I said earlier, the kills in this film were fun. This is a very bloody and violent film which really will satisfy the home viewer who is looking for that in this film. The shock to me overall is how creative and just ambitious this little film is till the last 15 minutes. I will say for people like me who loved the Wishmaster films, this could have easily been the 3rd one and would have made fans happy if some changes were made to the premise. This is well worth a watch just for the utter fun that it provides to the viewer.

Let me just be honest in closing, this is better than mot of the s*** Hollywood gives us and families go to the multiplex to get disappointed to. Plus, the price it would cost to buy this film to watch it as many times as your heart desired, you cannot even get two tickets to the movies. Support the indies, and this is a good little film that deserves a fan base.",1455321600,3,2479,4.1092783505154635
