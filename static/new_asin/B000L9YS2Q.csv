Worth every second of your time, except for the last DVD ""Where Does the Evidence Lead"" which is really a summary or introduction to the material the other 3 DVDs cover in detail. Production values are exemplarily, graphics great, and most important, the science is sound. In short, these DVDs lay out the evidence that Evolution Theory is a damn because it's holding back the progress of real science and understanding. And yes, it's evidence, not religion. In fact, there is no religion in theses DVDs at all. It picks up where Expelled (Ben Stein) leaves off. Getting into the science, facts, evidence, data, etc.

This is the parting of the ether. For those not scientifically trained, I'll let you in on an little secret most academics would rather you not know. Back before Einsteins Theory of Relativity, there was ""the ether."" The ether was what scientists said filled the void between the stars. The concept of light traveling through empty space was untenable to scientists of the day. There had to be something for the light to travel upon. So they invented ""the ether."" The theory went like this: Light (Electro-Magnetic Energy) had to travel in or on something and we see the light, thus there must be the ether. In fact the ether was so accepted it was part of Lorentzs Nobel prize for The Zeeman Effect.

However, ""the ether"" was shown to be really ""non-science"" in that it could not me demonstrated, measured or even described mathematically. So too goes Evolution and these DVDs expose the cracks in the evolution damn which will one day undoubtable break. My only complaint is that the 4th DVD should have been The Incorrigible Dr. Berlinski which I highly recommend. But the other 3 DVDs are great and you can give away the 4th to someone who might appreciate it.",1335571200,,1808,4.7365079365079366
8160422,5,B000L9YS2Q,"These 4 DVDs are very well done documentaries that bring the accepted, largely unquestioned assumptions regarding the origin of life and our universe into doubt.  Many thinking scientists are discovering startling facts through modern technologies that were not available in Darwin's day....facts that cannot be simply and neatly dealt within the theory of evolution as we know it.  I highly recommend these DVDs.",1313884800,,413,5.5396825396825395
