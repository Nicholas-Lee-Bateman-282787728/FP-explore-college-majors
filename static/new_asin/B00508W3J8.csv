4513543,5,B00508W3J8,"First, the remastered treatment of a favorite classic is exceptional.  There are only a few places where the original film scrapes and development flaws are noticeable, usually near the beginning and end of what would have been reel changes.  Generally though, the remastered version is extremely clean, sharp, and enjoyable to watch. Be sure to set your HDTV or player to exhibit the film in it original 1.33 to 1 (or 4:3) version so there are black bars on the side of the screen.  You'll be watching the film as it was intended to be viewed.

As a former Navy attack pilot from the early to mid 80s I recognized the involvement of the Navy in the film.  Some things really never change and that was evident in Flight Command.  The producers did a great job of capturing the ego and squadron ribbing of a nugget pilot (aka rookie), plus the competition and demands of squadron life. The story is more about the personalities of the squadron members and how they deal with the constant demands, expected successes, instant loss, and life-dependent trusts that are all realities in any squadron.  There is also a strong code of honor demonstrated.  It was surprising to see how the film dealt with the contrast between the expectation of being strong and silent when devastated and the deep intimacies that can develop when coping with the supressed thoughts and emotions.  The realities shown were very real.  When in the mood for nostalgic reflection, Flight Command fills the need beautifully.",1329004800,12,1496,4.8313725490196076
4513544,5,B00508W3J8,"I had always come into this movie at the tail end on memorial days TV offerings. I am so glad I got this as a gift from my wish list.
Taylor is classic and the supporting cast is great. If you grew up like I did watching WWII movies with my dad on ""Picture for a Sunday Afternoon"", you'll love this film which has been re-mastered.",1324857600,3,331,4.03030303030303
4513545,5,B00508W3J8,"Flight Command is a wonderful look into a Navy Fighting Squadron a year before the U.S. entered World War 2.  Starring Robert Taylor as Ensign Alan Drake, a fresh graduate of the Navy's Flight School in Pensacola, he's an eager young pilot assigned to a veteran Squadron, Fighting 8, better known as the ""Hellcats"".  Walter Pidgeon is his CO, Lt. Commander Bill Gary and Ruth Hussey plays Pidgeon's wife, Lorna Gary.  All three put in a fine performance.  The supporting cast does a fine job as well, making it believable that they were a very tight knit group of fliers.

The movie had full support of the U.S. Navy and it shows.  The attention to detail is excellent, giving the viewer a great inside look into what the pilots did in and out of the cockpit.  The aircraft featured is the Grumman F3F-2, the last biplane fighter ever flown by the Navy on their aircraft carriers.  It's great to see these pudgy fighters going through their paces.  At the time this movie was filmed, Fighting Squadron 8 actually didn't exist.  It wouldn't be formed for another year in the fall of 1941.

Have no fear as the story line is quite touching at times, especially between the three main characters.  Ruth Hussey plays the outwardly tough but inwardly unsettled wife of the squadron commander very well. There isn't a bad portrayal by any of the actors in the film.  Hats off to the production team for keeping this film on the level.  There's a realism to Flight Command that is so well done.  I can imagine that this movie had an effect on recruitment of Navy pilots just like Top Gun did back in the mid 80's.

The image quality of the Remastered version is outstanding.  Very crisp and clean and the audio is excellent too.

I really couldn't recommend this movie enough, I feel it's that entertaining in so many ways.  The story line, the acting and the look back at Naval Aviation at the end of its Golden Era make Flight Command a great choice.",1318550400,21,1945,4.553314121037464
4513546,4,B00508W3J8,"""Flight Command"" is a 1940 black and white film about Naval aviation just prior to WW 2. This was the first military film to come out after the start of the war in Europe in 1939, and was watched closely for its sentiments. In 1940 Americans were mixed on whether or not they should enter the war, which was still being debated at the end of 1941. Of course there had been several films about Germany and the Nazis prior to this (e.g., ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" in 1939) but this was the first film after the war had actually started.

The story of the cocky newcomer who must prove himself is a tried and true theme, repeated here.

Handsome and energetic Robert Taylor (1911-69) achieved success in more than 70 films like ""Magnificent Obsession"" (1935), ""Camille"" (1936), ""A Yank at Oxford"" (1938), ""Ivanhoe"" (1952), and ""Knights of the Round Table"" (1953). In this film he plays a cocky newcomer, and he got so enamored of flying that he became a private pilot and once the war broke out, joined the Navy Air Corps as a flying instructor.

Walter Pigeon (1897-1984) plays the CO. He appeared in more than 100 films between 1926 and 1978. He's best known for his Oscar nominated performances in ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1943) and ""Madame Curie"" (1944), although I liked him best as Dr. Morbius from ""The Forbidden Planet"" (1956). Pigeon's philosophy was - ""Maybe it was better never to become red hot. I'd seen performers like that and they never lasted long.""

Ruth Hussey (1911-2005) plays Pidgeon's wife. Hussey was nominated for an Oscar (""Philadelphia Story"") and an Emmy (""Lux Video Theatre"") and made more than 20 films but preferred work on stage and TV. She is excellent in this film and one can only wish she had made more films.

Nat Pendleton (1895-1967) plays ""Spike"" a mechanic. Pendleton is best known from his appearances in the Marx Brothers films, usually as a cop or a thug, and he later served the same purpose for Abbott and Costello in ""Buck Privates"" and worked with Myrna Loy in the ""Thin Man"" series.

Red Skelton (1913-97) makes his film debut as ""Mugger"". Skelton, of course, is best known as a world class comedian, but in the 40s and early 50s he was busy making films, the funniest of which was ""The Fuller Brush Man"" (1948). FWIW - Skelton split from his wife Edna following this film and she married the film's director. She stayed on as his manager and negotiated his million dollar contract with CBS.

Grim Paul Kelly (1899-1956) plays the acting commander. He started in the silent film days and made more than 100 films between 1911 and 1957. He's best known for playing Warden Duffy in ""Duffy of San Quenton"" (1954) which is kind of curious since Kelly served 2 years for manslaughter (1927-9), but I remember him best as the determined man in ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954).

The film's director Frank Borzage (1893-1962) started as an actor in silent films and then became a director. He was heavily influenced by German director F.W. Murnau with whom he worked. He won the Oscar for ""7th Heaven"" (1927) - the first time an Oscar was ever given - and ""Bad Girl"" (1931). Borzage made a variety of films, but military films were the single largest group (13) including ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1932) ""Three Comrades"" (1938), ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940), ""Stage Door Canteen"" (1943), ""Till we Meet Again"" (1944), and ""China Doll"" (1958).

More than other directors, he liked to explore the role of women within military institutions (e.g., ""The Magnificent Dolly"", ""Stage Door Canteen"") which he does in this film. Another common theme in Borzage films is the impact of a newcomer (e.g., ""Stranded"", ""The Mortal Storm"") which is clearly the central focus of this film.

Franz Waxman (1906-67) provides the score. Waxman was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won twice (""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Sunset Blvd""). He was a favorite of Hitchcock who used him in 4 films and earned 2 of his Oscar nominations (""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion""). Sometimes Waxman's scores can overwhelm a film, but in this case he is in perfect harmony with the script.

Harold Rosson (1895-1988) was the cinematographer. Rosson filmed nearly 150 films and was nominated for an Oscar 6 times, winning for ""The Garden of Allah"" (1937). He made such notable films as ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" (1944), and ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950). Rosson turns in his usual fine job, offering varying angles and a plethora of long, medium, and close-ups.

Arnold Gillepsie (1899-1978) and Douglas Shearer (1899-1971) were nominated for an Oscar for special effects. Gillepsie, Shearer, and Rosson later worked together on ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" (1944) for which Gillepsie won his first of 3 Oscars. In total, Gillepsie received 12 nominations.

Douglas Shearer was the brother of film star Norma Shearer who was the wife of MGM big wig Irving Thalberg, so unemployed Shearer soon found himself as head of the newly created Sound department. Over 20+ years he supervised sound production on nearly 1,000 films, earning 22 Oscar nominations and 10 wins, including ""The Big House"" (1930), ""San Francisco"" (1936), and ""The Great Caruso"" (1951).

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said the film "" is plotted mainly out of obvious clichs, and the dialogue which is spoken is moldy, too"" but nonetheless ""the actual air shots are beautiful"". He called it ""just a routine adventure film.""
Films about Naval aviation include ""The Flying Fleet"" (1929), ""Hell Divers"" (1931), ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), ""Dive Bomber"" (1941), ""The Fighting Lady"" (1944), ""A Wing and a Prayer"" (1945), ""Flat Top"" (1952), ""Men of the Fighting Lady"" (1954), ""Wings of the Eagle"" (1957), ""Midway"" (1975), ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""BAT 21"" (1988), and ""Flight of the Intruder"" (1991).

This is a good film with a good cast and some nice photography.

BTW - The Hell Cats described in this film has nothing to do with a submarine film called ""Hellcats of the Navy"" (1957), starring Ronald Reagan and (future wife) Nancy Davis - this was their only film together.

FWIW - The Grumman F6F Hellcat was the most successful aircraft in naval history destroying 5271 enemy aircraft.",1306627200,29,6146,4.826996197718631

4513568,4,B00508W3J8,"Okay, girls, this movie stars young, handsome Robert Taylor. What's not to like!

Taylor plays a young, eager Navy flight school graduate assigned to his first fleet squadron among whose veteran Naval Aviators he must prove himself - after he's made a series of operationally hazardous misjudgments and at least one social gaffe in the close squadron community of aviators and wives. In a way 'Flight Command' is the 'Top Gun' tale of its time - young Naval Aviators proving themselves. The movie's well-paced, with some familiar faces in the cast, including a wisecracking Red Skelton furnishing his trademark good-natured patter for comic relief.

Airplane modelers hungry for images to provide details of the Grumman F3F fighter will love the actual close-up and in-flight footage of that tubby but trim & tidy biplane.

Me? I just love to see Robert Taylor up there on the silver HDTV screen.",1401062400,3,896,5.04054054054054

4513571,3,B00508W3J8,"This is a movie about navy pilots just prior to WWII. Robert Taylor does OK, but I did not think the movie was especially good. It seemed more like a 1930's frat boy movie than anything real serious.

The pilots look too old to me, and don't act like anyone in any military unit ever would.

The scenes of the aircraft in flight are pretty impressive, although limited.

I had not seen it before, and it was on cable TV on Memorial Day weekend so I DVR'd it and just got around to watching it a few days ago. It was still fun to watch, even though I did not find it especially good.",1373587200,,582,4.087719298245614
4513572,5,B00508W3J8,"Director Frank Borzage's 1940 film FLIGHT COMMAND received generous help from the U.S. Navy's aviation branch, and it shows. The story line is Hollywood schmaltz, but the production values are top-notch (this WAS an M-G-M film, after all)and the period  technical details are pretty accurate. It's a little eerie to watch a Navy fighter squadron flying Grumman F3F biplanes not long before Pearl Harbor---and to consider that the Navy and Marine pilots flying onscreen would soon be in actual combat, including Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington. But for all that, It's an entertaining and visually excellent film. Recommended.",1340409600,2,618,5.4375
8450903,5,B00508W3J8,"I had been searching for this movie for a long time and never could find it as I did not know the title. After watching it again after almost 50 years, it remained entertaining, even if seriously dated. It had all of the human elements of risk, daring, scientific innovation, and exploration of new frontiers in aviation along with the emotional love story. It is a forgotten classic that should be enjoyed again.",1490832000,,413,4.671232876712328
8450904,4,B00508W3J8,Good movie for it's day and time.  I have to admit I got it for Red Skelton and he never lets me down even if he has a small bit.  A good movie and will keep you entertained.,1484438400,,174,3.5526315789473686

8450909,4,B00508W3J8,"Another one of Robert Taylor's great military films. A film about Navy flyers that has spectacular flying footage worked in.  The real footage of early planes doing incredible stunts is as exciting as plane footage gets. No computerized effects here!  There are several close calls which leave the viewers on the edge of their seats. As already mentioned by other reviewers, it had a lasting influence on Robert Taylor by causing him to become a pilot. He plays a role much like his role in A YANK AT OXFORD. He is very confident and cocky and determined. The loyalty and devotion of military personnel is a part of this film from start to finish. The actors are all at their best and the armed forces are respected and revered. All branches of the military can enjoy and be proud of this film.
