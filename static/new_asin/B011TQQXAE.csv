8725096,5,B011TQQXAE,"In every way, this is an excellent performance of Mahler's 7th symphony.  Chailly provides consistent and enthusiastic direction, and all orchestral participants show off their talents, and, if I may say so, they also show a passion for this work.

Blu-ray allowed me to see and hear it with the utmost clarity, using audio format  5.1 DTS HD surround.  The technical quality just couldn't be better.

As to Mahler's 7th, it is the happiest of all of his symphonies, even though it has often been called the ""Song of the Night,"" and includes the scherzo (3rd movement) called ""Schattenhaft"" (shadowy, or perhaps spooky).  Yes, even though this shadowy movement includes many night shrieks, a mocking, almost grotesque waltz, and the patter of scampering animal feet, including strange growls and howls, and eerie night breezes, the entire work shows us not to be afraid of ""things that go bump in the night.""

Immediately after the Schattenhaft movement's scary sounds, we have the 4th movement, andante amoroso, where guitar and mandolin bring love into the picture.  Love triumphs over the nighttime scariness, and Mahler finishes the work with what he calls a Rondo - Finale; Allegro ordinario, which is nothing less than 20 minutes of JOYFUL celebration!  There are many fanfares, announcing more and more joyful outbursts, and Mahler and Chailly let us hear the joyful shouts of each participating instrument.  It's like all of Nature is singing a joyful hymn----making a joyful noise in celebration of life.",1453334400,,1513,5.1138211382113825
8725097,5,B011TQQXAE,"Before purchasing this Chailly Mahler 7,  I had acquired the Abbado/Lucerne and the Boulez/RCO versions quite some time ago. Abbado's was very good for a 2005 recording, but today's technical advances have afforded Chailly notably better results. Boulez's version suffers from poor video quality.

I agree with almost all of Ian Giles' review regarding the Chailly performance, so I will restrict my comments to what I perceive to be fairly dramatic benefits of Chailly's version over the Abbado.

The sound recording sounds clearer and cleaner to me - in fact I hear more things going on from individual players than I did with Abbado. I use 5.1 DTS HD surround. If anybody's interested, I use a NAD surround receiver, Samsung blu ray player and Mirage Omni top end speakers, so my opinions are based on that system. The audio also sounds more impactful.

I'm a big fan of divided violins. Mahler, as well as most composers before him, has the first and second violins playing totally different things at the same time. Abbado lumped them all together, with the violas to the right side, which eliminated the ability to hear these contrapuntal differences. Chailly, as he has so far through his whole Mahler series, uses the split setup with the Leipzig Orchestra.

The other thing I liked better was the prominent role given to the timpani, both aurally and visually, much more so than in Abbado's set. At one point in the last movement, Chailly has the timpanist ""get a little help from his friend""' as they both belt away two-handed on two adjacent timps. Quite an impact!

Directors and cameramen are now getting much more precise at following the composer as he passes the themes or lines from one instrument to another. These are usually split second moves as the video migrates from one camera to another. The other key to success here is to focus in on the most important instrument when the particular passage is being played by several participant diverse instruments. Chailly's engineers and director do a much better job than Abbado's, but then, this is ten years on, so this is to be expected.

So I do not agree with Ian that there's not much to choose between Abbado and Chailly. I still enjoy the Abbado, and watched it through again after watching the Chailly twice. My advice would be that if you have neither, get the Chailly, and if the you have the Abbado, get the Chailly as well. Chailly still has 1,3 and 10 to go. I generally have preferred Chailly to Abbado, except in #6, and I prefer Boulez's # 2 to both of theirs, mostly because of the magical way the soprano Diana Damrau rises imperceptibly out of the chorus in the finale.

Amazon is still asking $40 for this disc, but it is usually available from one of their third party vendors for $30 delivered. In any event, a great disc, beatifully played and conducted, with absolutely state of the art audio and video.",1448409600,5,2895,4.73015873015873
8725098,5,B011TQQXAE,"Mahlers 7th Symphony, once known by the name Song of the Night, has split opinion as to its meaning and ultimate success as a composition. Mahler himself, described the work as  my best work, with a primarily cheerful character. Schoenberg said I had an impression of absolute peace based on artistic harmony but others quoted in the discs booklet, were not so convinced and had considerable reservations about the work as a cohesive whole and about the final movement in particular.

Chailly, as elsewhere in this developing series of the complete Mahler symphonies, takes a straight and unemotional view of the symphony preferring to let the music speak for itself rather than imposing a personal interpretation upon it. By doing this, of course, he is indeed imposing his own interpretation and that interpretation, or viewpoint, is not the same as Abbados much admired version at Lucerne for example.

Whereas Abbado encourages his players to express themselves individually within his own overall concept thus achieving a chamber-like instrumental freedom, Chailly adopts a more traditional approach which requires a unified response from his orchestra as a complete unified body. Chailly also favours a generally forward momentum, as with his other performances in this series, and this works well in this symphony.

The symphony has been described as a journey from darkness into light with the three central movements being the transitional movements, where the more dramatically restless mood of the first movement is transformed through the two nachtmusik movements and central scherzo, into the optimistic character of the final movement. The last movement has been criticised for being too lightweight and lacking in suitable gravitas especially where the central movements are delivered more darkly than here. Chailly keeps the mood relatively light in the middle three movements and there is little or nothing sinister to be detected in the pivotal scherzo movement which becomes more of a good-humoured but quirky interlude between the nachtmusik 1 and 2. Those two movements are enabled to be more peaceful by contrast and that prepares the ground for the virtuoso high jinks demanded of the orchestra in the final movement.

The Leipzig orchestra is fully up to the task that both Mahler and Chailly set by this generally upbeat approach to the music and the result is undoubtedly successful as a delivery of the music as written, even if Chailly would resist the idea that it is an interpretation. It stands as a very successful alternative choice for collectors to Abbados version. Both offer fine playing set within fine recording values. Those are closely matched as both have been produced by Paul Smaczny, the Abbado recording when he was working for Euroarts and this newer recording when he was working for his own label.

The approach to both recordings in terms of camera use is practically the same. High quality HD recording equipment has been used for both discs and both the recordings deliver a realistic and satisfying reproduction of the two concerts. There is nothing of significance to separate the two recordings on offer therefore. The issue for collectors is more about the degree to which the players have been encouraged to express themselves within an overall concept. Abbado offers more individualism while Chailly offers a more cohesive, tightly knit orchestral response. Both are excellent in their own ways.

This performance, led by Chailly & excellently produced by Paul Smaczny, offers collectors a high quality and satisfying option to seriously consider for purchase, even if they already own the equally fine Abbado recording from Lucerne.",1446336000,,3691,5.245762711864407
