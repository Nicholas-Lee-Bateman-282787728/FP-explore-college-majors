8158074,5,B000GAKBIU,"I was finally able to find this movie. I am glad that Amazon had it. Cubi Gooding is great as a supporting actor in it, but it is hard to find. The movie was in excellent condition and plays well. Delivery was fast too. It is about made-made crystal that has massive destructive power that a vengeful ex-colonel is trying to get his hands on it. The material must be kept cold otherwise it will explode and it is up to Urich and Gooding to keep it chilled. I enjoyed the movie.",1330300800,,477,4.195652173913044
