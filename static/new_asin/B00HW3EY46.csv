6230485,5,B00HW3EY46,"Great story, and I feel the director hit the objective by making it feel authentic. It's a realistic story about working your way through the bad, and finding hope. If you don't like realism in a movie than this might not be your cup of tea. It's a serious movie and it teeters of course on the abortion issue, but it's not really about that...instead it focuses on humanizing the girl rather than making her some kind of propaganda machine, and it also shows how there are a lot of great people helping others out there, and how a community of people in a bad situation can come together and create a positive environment for themselves. There is a lot of emotions and issues going on in this movie...it's not for someone that wants to just be entertained, it's a real film that makes you think. It's a work of art as far as I'm concerned.",1398124800,46,840,4.391025641025641
6230486,5,B00HW3EY46,"My husband and I saw this in the theatre a few months ago and we both were impressed.  It was hard to watch at times, it did not sugar coat the story of this young girl in search of a home.  The performances were excellent and it was refreshing to see Christianity portrayed in a positive and realistic fashion.  I, for one , have grown tired of watching the values I cherish constantly ridiculed by the media.  I watch TV and attend movies less and less because of this.  If more movies of this caliber become available, I will gladly change my habits and return to the movie theaters.  This was an uplifting and thought provoking film about social issues, one I can highly recommend.",1397347200,7,685,4.44
6230487,4,B00HW3EY46,"""Gimme Shelter"" (2013 release; 101 min.) is not to be confused with the Rolling Stones 1970 concert documentary (nor does it contain the classic Rolling Stones song). It brings the story, ""based on true events"" we are reminded at the beginning, of 16 yr. old Agnes ""Apple"" Bailey (played by Vanessa Hudgens), who in the first scene of the movie is running away from June, her drug-abusing mom (played by Rosario Dawson) and her mom's boyfriend. She manages to get from New York across to New Jersey and finds her dad, whom she hasn't seen in ages and now turns out to be a stinking rich Wall Street investment banker, married with two young kids. Apple has a hard time fitting in, and on top of that now it turns out that she is pregnant. Her dad suggests she gets an abortion and ""move on with your life"" but Apple resists. At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie was shot in 2011, and has been sitting on the distribution shelf for quite some time. Second, even though we saw Hudgens last year in a very unlike-Disney role in ""Spring Breakers"", you could easily argue that this movie was an even earlier attempt to break out of the Disney image (although on much safer territory). When you first see her, she is almost unrecognizable. I know it took me a few moments to adjust. Third, there are a couple of great performances in here, none more so than from Rosario Dawson in the role of the completely unlikeable mom. James Earl Jones as Father McCarthy has a small role to. He tries to bring some much needed guidance to Apple. At one point, he comments to her: ""being young and pregnant is like being a pinwheel, you just drift as the wind takes you"". Fourth, there are some good music placements in the movie, Lara Del Rey's ""Born To Die"" among them.

This movie sat on the shelf for a reason. It is not a great movie, even though it is inspirational and has some good performances. I saw it in the theater last month on its first weekend of wide release, and the screening I saw this at, on a Friday evening, was poorly attended (and I saw at least 2 people leave midway through). This was obviously not a box office hit in the theaters, but I think it's still worth checking it out when it comes on DVD/Blu-ray, assuming you keep your expectations in moderation.",1394064000,3,2436,4.4231625835189305
6230488,4,B00HW3EY46,"The shelter would be for a runaway girl who has become homeless and now finds herself pregnant. She had left home hoping that she could find her successful father but now it looks as though she may be repeating her unwed mother's turbulent story.

Writer/director Ron Kraus (""Amexica"") inspires his actors, both with his words and his direction. There were several long, single-take scenes that were notable. Watch for the one at the front door with Dawson and Dowd. I'll keep an eye out for this guy.

Here is some of the cast:
  * Vanessa Hudgens (""Machete Kills"") is Apple, our desperate runaway; her mother is a drug addict; her foster families don't work out; she has no job, no life skills, and no resources; now her new-found father wants her to have an abortion.
  * Brendan Fraser (""Inkheart"") is her father, Tom Fitzpatrick, a successful Wall Street businessman. He was only 19 when he fathered our heroine and bailed out on her mother because his parents wanted him to go to college.
  * Rosario Dawson (""Zookeeper"") is the reason our gal ran away: Mom is a drug addict and a prostitute...reason enough, don't you think? Her actions are chilling; our screening audience gasped during one scene.
  * James Earl Jones (""Jack and the Beanstalk"" voice) brings hope with his role as the white knight who comes galloping into our wounded girl's broken life, insisting that things CAN be better.
  * Ann Dowd (""Side Effects"") is Kathy, the practical and loving woman who provides that much-needed shelter.

This PG-13 story is based on true incidents in the life of a pregnant runaway, with some very welcome photos of the real people during the final credits. I LOVE it when that happens! Amazon will let me know when the DVD is available; I always notify my JayFlix.net folks.",1393545600,51,1782,4.765472312703583
6230569,5,B00HW3EY46,"Beautiful movie it's an example of how much children suffer from their parents mistakes. Being shuffle around the foster system  not knowing what they may find there, love or abuse. Apple  showed her strength  and devotion to her expected baby.

6230571,5,B00HW3EY46,"OMG! What a good movie. Vanessa Hudgens was absolutely fantastic in the lead role as 'Apple'. At times it was very hard to watch because of all the emotional trauma this poor girl went thru. And it wasn't easy keeping the tears from flowing.

It brought tears to my eyes and although the ending, not to give it away, but the ending was a little bit annoying but regardless, overall, I give this movie 4 stars. It really gives you the point of view of someone struggling... definetly worth the watch!",1525564800,,351,4.587301587301587

6230576,3,B00HW3EY46,The movie lacked any cohesive point or principle. If it was trying to tell a true story it did so without any real narrative or moral. The choices made by the protagonists and antagonists made little sense. The acting was okay but the story was a jumbled mess of what not to do in your own life with a happy ending taken away for good measure.,1521417600,,343,4.212121212121212

Yes, there is an overarching theme of ""Gimme Shelter"" analogous to my previous statement. Get your tissues for this one. I may have shed a couple, few... alright several tears in the last act.
Highly recommend this! Vanessa Hudgens nails it. Rosario Dawson turns in a haunting performance. Best of both careers imo.",1518393600,,468,4.719512195121951
6230590,5,B00HW3EY46,Rosario Dawson made me believe her scary drugged up character.  Apple's emotions were first heart wrenching then slowly hopeful.  She really lucked out in finding her wonderful father,1518048000,,183,5.5

Vanessa Hudgens is a brilliant young actress and shines as Apple, a young girl struggling to survive abuse, a drug addicted mother, and her pregnancy.  Rosario Dawson is great also as her mother.

6230597,1,B00HW3EY46,"Horrible movie, bad acting, selfish ending.

If this is a true story, that girl is the most selfish person in this world. The cast of girls that were pissed at her in the end because she found a home? Wtf. Grow up. Shelters are for people without homes or safe/suitable options. If your nice guy millionaire dad shows up and saves the day, you take it so another woman can have your spot in the shelter. If you feel that strongly about the shelter, donate your damn time but don't take a spot from another homeless mother.
Not impressed. Left a bad taste in my mouth and an intense urge to slap the stupid out of someone.",1515974400,3,621,4.3076923076923075

6230640,2,B00HW3EY46,"While the movie may try to ""be real"" when it comes to the girl's initial predicament, it goes into pure fantasy at the end. Not only does the ""fallen girl"" have a rich birth-daddy to support her, she also changes everything during the 6 months that she is ""sheltered."" It's a wonder her tattoo didn't miraculously vanish along with all the other problems. Give birth, everybody, make sure your babies aren't too dark and everything's going to turn out peachy, or any other pastel color.",1515024000,,486,4.729411764705882

6230642,4,B00HW3EY46,"Overall this is a sad but inspirational story. I only wish it had ended with more of an ""afterword"". The credits at the end do show real photos of the characters. The real character ""Apple"" apparently became a nurse and worked for this same shelter (Several Sources Shelters) that is featured in the movie but that isn't mentioned in the story. I also wondered why it left us with her returning to the shelter after she had been given hope and a future for herself and her baby at her father's home. Didn't her space at the shelter need to be given to another girl who now needed that love and care? It's hard to find the real story online but from what I read it's loosely based on the real character with some other girls' stories mixed in.",1514505600,,742,4.345323741007194

This is an all too common story in America with hopeless futures, financial desperation and lost dreams. But the love of the women around her is what saved her. Although nothing unusual about the story, it simply shows the power of love and how when someone is helped, everything can change for the good. These women have great careers ahead of them.

6230743,5,B00HW3EY46,"Many of the one and two star reviews here made reference to the story being slow or Lifetime-ish, and some made reference to religious agenda... everyone has their own opinion. While my husband and I can't say this was an ""enjoyable"" movie, we both thought it was very good.
  It is difficult to ""enjoy"" watching the struggle of children who experience very real heartache and pain as a result of absent or selfish parents. The ""good"" comes in when that child realizes what they want and what is possible and then is found by real-life, caring people who give selflessly of themselves to stop the cycle.
  If you are looking for an action-adventure, this is not for you. If you can watch a film without dissecting or critiquing the acting to get to the story, this is watchable. If you don't mind be reminded of how good your life is compared to some, watch it... you might also label this as ""very good.""",1506729600,3,905,4.533742331288344

After seeing her in other movie and TV roles, some of them comedic, I'd never have guessed she could play a teenage runaway so convincingly it would make me tear up.

I thought Vanessa Huggins played the mess out of her character. This movie had me in tears as it brought back so many memories of my relationship with my mother (even though not on drugs-she had a lot of demons). Overall, this movie is five stars. I would've given it more if I could! If you we're not one to live this type life or had a hard time coping with the stress of it if you did live it, you may have a hard time understanding this movie.

She had a place where she could live and yet she went back to the shelter and took a room/bed that could have been used for some other girl in need.  The ending was so ridiculous that it ruined the movie.,1458864000,,604,4.111111111111111

It doesn't work out so well in the beginning but resolution happens because of love and understanding. I was disturbed that all the babies-in-arms at the unwed mother shelter had baby bottles thrust at them for their feedings instead of their mothers' breasts. Formula is very expensive. There was not one scene where a mom was breastfeeding. Also, not one mention of the word ""adoption"" as though it is no longer an option for an unwed mother. In the movie there were only two options: abortion or raise the kid yourself with the assistance of the state and charities.  Is this what the world has come to?",1455062400,,760,4.757575757575758

6231658,5,B00HW3EY46,Such a sad story but very well done by the actors.  I would not call it an up lifting movie because it was such a human tragedy. It really shows that when you are down and out most people do not understand then therefore are not willing to help.  It is hard to know what to do to help in situations that are so difficult.

A biological dad she never really knew.  This movie illustrates that the human spirit is real, and it's as much a part of us as our mind and body.",1453593600,,528,4.387755102040816

6231706,5,B00HW3EY46,"This is a touching and poignant movie, and I would highly recommend it.  It shows the power love can have over even a broken soul.  It also shows the profound impact drug use has on normal human emotion, turning a mother into a monster.  Would be a great discussion starter for a teen group I would think.  This, in my estimation, is not a movie for kids under maybe 15; I know it is PG-13, but I think it would be better shown to middle teens and up than younger ones.  It has portions that are quite disturbing.",1449187200,2,513,4.1938775510204085

6231801,3,B00HW3EY46,"It's a good story handicapped by somewhat disjointed storytelling.  The plot jumps around a lot, ostensibly to keep the viewer interested, but it serves only confusion -- what the heck is going on here?  The gap in time and plot lines between ""Apple's"" birth, abandonment, abuse, neglect, desperate reconnect with her biological father (really?) is too much and lends a touch of implausibility.  The father is too far disconnected and too successful to have a daughter like Apple that he sees for the first time in 15 years.  If he's really that good, it's hard to ever see him with Apple's mother who is a complete mess.  And then to have her dropped in the middle of his family and home, pregnant, abused, neglected, beat up and homeless, in rags, and not be repugnant is a bit much -- way too many disconnects there to be plausible.

If  this yarn is based on a true story, the screenwriters must have taken a lot of liberties with the real story to embellish it in a misguided attempt to make it more interesting.  And the final insult to the viewer is that the story is left without an ending -- Apple goes back to the home for pregnant teenagers rather than start a new life under the tutelage of her biological father -- arrrgg!",1447804800,,1235,4.531531531531532

I have a new respect for Vanessa Hudgens.  She's made at least one bad choice in her life and this movie may be allegorical for her.  People make mistakes and often there isn't anyone to help them pick up the pieces.  The fact that there was someone for Apple in Kathy DiFiore and Father  McCarthy is wonderful.

Some girls, either because of bad choices they make or sometimes due to circumstances beyond their control that wind up snowballing, wind up in the situation.  I expect that most don't have a happy ending.  When someone like Kathy DiFiori provides the kind of support that these girls desperately need and gives them at least the potential for a happy ending for their lives, it matters.  God bless them for what they do.",1446336000,2,767,4.580882352941177

Vanessa Hudgens gives a consistently riveting performance as the girl whose story is being told without sentimentality or moralizing. Conclusions the audience draws are strictly their own responses to a very real situation. I was on board with Apple. Her mother scared me. I understand perfectly how Apple's father's wife felt - she was a bit over the top in her portrayal. I had absolute contempt for Brendan Frasier's sniveling character. I loved watching the babies.

6232440,5,B00HW3EY46,"What a moving movie. I doubt that anyone seeing this movie could neglect to take Vanessa Hudgens seriously as an actress. She was unrecognizable as she transformed into an at risk teen who becomes a teenage mother. Her performance was beyond exceptional. I have to admit that I blew her off for many years as a sugar coated Disney star. She outperformed any ten people in this movie.

There were also very solid performances from Brendan Fraser (who I have always loved), and Rosario Dawson. In fact, really everyone in the movie did a great job with their role. I was surprised how blown away I was by it.

I'm a 30 something year old female, with no kids (yet) and even I was able to relate to this story in a way that surprised me. In fact, I was so moved that after I found out it was based on a true story, I looked up the shelter from the movie and made a donation.

The character Apple might be fictitious, but there are girls like this all over the country right at this moment. It is heartwarming to know that someone has the tenacity to do something about it. This movie brings these real-life struggles to the spotlight in the most genuine possible way. Well done.",1441756800,7,1175,4.3807339449541285

I would call this Brendan Fraser's best acting performance, and James Earl Jones, need I say more?

The movie itself flowed great. Small holes but with the emotional experience that grabs you right from the get go, they are hard to notice.

This movies gives an all to real look into how the homeless, orphaned, and kids in the foster system are treated and mistrusted. All to often are they stripped of the benefit of the doubt, and this movie, I believe, shows perfecting what can help with a little love, patience, and trust.",1441324800,,720,4.523076923076923

So having a child in their minds gives them the opportunity to give the love that their longing for in their lives.  But the reality of it all is they don't understand the real sacrifice on their lives once the child is born.  It's amazing how a house full of strangers can feel like your family then your own flesh and blood.

True courage in a dark, cold and dangerous world to get away from the doomed life in front of her.

I'm not sure whether it is because of it matching real events and the reactions by the couple, mostly the stepmother, as heart-wrenching. Their behavior would be emotionally harmful to any teenager, even if she/he is not an abuse victim. Or maybe it is difficult for me to see Fraser cast in this type of role. He is skeptical of her motives, I did not like the cynicism or the force he pushed his decision on her, I may have him typecast as more optimistic and supportive type of character, much as he plays in Crash. However, that would attest to his depth as an actor and the fact that i always liked him has me biased. I would have given 4.5 stars if possible. For me, I have a difficult time with absolutes and only rate a 5 if I absolutely loved it. I respect any movie that is capable of bringing me with them onto the emotional roller-coaster they ride, much like Precious did.

An unmarried  man father's a child, renounces the adulterous mother (or was renounced by the mother), and the baby grows up in the Bronx bounced in and out of foster care, depending on whether or not her mother is in jail at the time, with only a note left before her birth to her from the father. When she can endure her life no longer as a teen, she seeks him out to discover he's wealthy and married and has a lovely family. She goes to an unwed mother's home because she's pregnant and unmarried and can't/won't return to her mother. She delivers the baby at the home among new friends---other girls in a similar situation. It's just dull and simple and predictable. James Earl Jones is the priest who shows the girl what real love is and that's the only value in this movie. It shows the goodness of God, that God orders all things for good, and that trusting God will give you hope if that's your belief system. If it's not in your tradition that God is good and God is love, then you'll be really bored, I think. She named her baby 'Hope"" because she experienced God's love when she trusted His goodness to be there for her.",1438819200,2,1150,4.324074074074074

But she really had it bad with her abusive Mom.  I hope Apple does well in life and that she makes a good Mom and changes her life around.  It is possible I did.  Also the world could use more people  like  Father McCarthy.  The movie was so moving and when Apple had her baby she showed such love for her baby.  That part really made me cry.  I am so glad to see there are good people like Kathy DiFiore who transformed her home into a shelter and gave the teens the option of life instead of abortion.  It is a very moving story.

6233304,1,B00HW3EY46,"Only my opinion, but I found this film to be incredibly un-""uplifting"". The abused pregnant star is, after attempts by her relatives to either abort the baby or ""ride the welfare train"" to a bigger monthly check, saved by a benevolent (""Here she is with Mother Theresa."") woman who runs a shelter for under-aged pregnant girls. The girls are given love and support, but what happens then? We are shown all of the happy moms with their healthy kids, but what happens when a new girl arrives? Whose bed does she get? The new mothers obviously can't stay there for long, but no mention is made of what happens to them.
Gimme Shelter is just a fairy tale. Religion doesn't care what happens after that poor fetus is saved.",1436227200,,718,4.573643410852713

6233632,3,B00HW3EY46,It was hard to watch a young girl in such pain and chaos but it was realistic.  As parents we need to love our children unconditionally and pay attention to how we can help others around us.

6233637,3,B00HW3EY46,It's a little slow to develop but overall great acting by Vanessa Hudgens. She portrays an abused kid with a teen pregnancy.

6233654,4,B00HW3EY46,I have been on a Vanessa Hudgens binge lately and have been pleasantly surprised by the risks she has taken after High School Musical.  I believed her character and immediately had empathy for her struggle.  Casting is so important and Rosario Dawson brings a touching vulnerability to the damaged drug-addicted mother. James Earl Jones and Brendan Frazier were thespian treats. A bit heavy in terms of subject matter but cetera worth the time.,1433808000,,444,5.068493150684931

6233901,5,B00HW3EY46,"I loved this movie, for reasons a bit different from the movie. As Agnes 'Apple' Bailey talked about the many foster homes she'd been placed in, my heart broke! As she was telling her father and his wife the jist of the tragedies in her past, it was sad how slow or never showed any kind of compassion towards her. I was excited when she'd gotten in the car to go live with her dad and his family, but that's just it, it was his family. I also hated that the wife lied about the Dr office situation to get husband and that she never had to come clean in front of both of them. Celine Dions song at the end threw me into sobbing tears. We are getting ready to be foster parents and we pray to give these precious children lots of love and comfort that will let all their lives. Awesome cast!",1433116800,,790,4.103225806451613

6233962,5,B00HW3EY46,"Amazing story of how an abused and confused teenage girl, Agnes (Apple as her biological father calls her) seeking help in a tough situation, pregnant and homeless, can bring a gift of life that can change things for the better. With the help of loving people and God's grace she is sent to a home for unwed mothers who have similar backgrounds. They become family and are given the love of a family which many never have experienced. Some of the love is a disciplined environment with rules that seems to be stifling, but it provides the environment to help get ready to be a mother.  The change of heart of Apple's father, from encouraging her to abort the child to being a loving grandpa welcoming her into the home is amazing.  It would have been nice to have the back story of how this happened developed a little more. Overall this is a positive pro-life story in real situation that many young women are in today and provides hope for those struggling that their are people out there who love and care for them.",1433030400,,1018,4.4972972972972975

6234132,3,B00HW3EY46,"This was a good movie.  An eyeopener for me trying to understand the twists and turns, ups and downs of teen pregnant girls who have been abused and neglected.  (Agnes) Apple tries to reach out to her father who got her mother pregnant by accident but was young and his parents sent him off to college.  He had regrets but moved on while his daughter was brought up in a world unknown to him.  He and his wife think the best thing to do is to get her an abortion but Apple wants her baby and following the path of a preacher who helps her get into a teen shelter she finds a ""sisterhood"". It is presumed  that she finally does get back with her father and her child grows up to know her grandfather, but it would have been  nice to have shown more of a continuation of the  family and what finally happens to Apple and her baby after she asks her father for understanding and time to become his daughter when she returns to the ""sisterhood"".",1432598400,,941,4.223463687150838

6234311,4,B00HW3EY46,"This girl has never had a break, and she knows it. When she finally has love around her, her transformation is beautiful to watch. Vanessa Hudgens performance is Oscar worthy. But my favorite performance is Rosario Dawson's. She's a great beauty who forsake beauty for the role---though it was plain that the character, in her youth, was a beauty. Rosario's role as Mom to this broken teenager answers all kinds of questions on how ""Apple"" was the way she was--though the actual ""last straw"" for Apple is only vaguely explored. It doesn't matter. Mom is the devil, and Apple knows it. Now Dad, is another story, and Brendan Fraser does a great job as the not-too-much-milktoast absent father, but still, can he tame his wife -- the evil Stepmother? Absent father really wasn't what he wanted to be. Very interesting family relationship dynamics. This girl's pleas for help and her desire to better her standing is palpable throughout this performance.
Meaty roles for both Ms. Hudgens and Ms. Dawson. Brava!",1431907200,2,1007,4.929411764705883

There were no real surprises in the plot, which was based on a true story of a woman who took in homeless pregnant teens before and after they gave birth. It was well acted by the main character, and serves as a grim reminder of the state of an overloaded system caused by women who should never have given birth.",1431388800,,592,4.247787610619469

6234502,4,B00HW3EY46,"Gimme Shelter is a true story about a relate-able problem that happens all across America. A trouble kid tries to resolve her problems with her drug addict mom and ends up in a pickle. She goes through a struggle that many don't understand and few have experienced. Some actors like, Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Hudgens portrayed really good character that made it believable. However, James Earl Jones and Brendan Fraser may have been miscast. If you like action movies, this is not the movie for you. If you like true stories that show real life you will enjoy this movie.

Gimme Shelter is about a young teenager who comes a long way.  For example, she runs away from her mom in an attempt to find her dad, but she runs into problems. The is a a more serious story but definitely worth the view. Realistic dialogue, fast moving action and a main character that you really care about. Weak acting from Mr. White Man Brendan Frasier, but amazing performances from Vanessa Hudgens and Rosario Dawson. The actresses that played the girls in the shelter were especially realistic. We watched this in a high school class, the students were very moved and found it easy to relate.

This movie is worth two hours of your time. This movie is based on true events and it showed what real life is like.  Apple (Agnes) is a young teenager trying to find a place to live. She runs away from her mom to search for her dad. She has many obstacles in her way but in the end she finds closure when she realizes that family isn't about blood. Its about who cares and protects you. Although there was a weak performance by the dad (Brendan Frasier) withdrawn, lacks emotion, Vanessa Hudgens and Rosario Dawson did an amazing job.  This type of movie is both emotional and thrilling.",1430956800,,1765,4.59047619047619

6234538,5,B00HW3EY46,"This is a very powerful and compelling movie. That is is based on a true story only makes it tougher to watch because we see into the realities of some lives that most would rather not have to see.

In an age where Hollywood stays clear of pro-Christian themes, this one is effectively pro-christian, even as it shows the gritty aspects of life. In all the difficulties shown in the movie, there is no dependence upon cursing, yet all the actors and actresses convey the emotions of the story very well. Vanessa Hudgens deserves one of those Golden statue awards for her portrayal of Apple (Agnes), the lead character of the story.

There is no nudity and no sexual content in the course of this movie, even though it is an underlying story arc.

I would suggest this movie for everyone who asks the question, ""Where is God when this happens..."" as this movie DOES bring that question in to play.

I would say that this is a great movie for the whole family but it is a very heavy topic and parents should watch at least once to be prepared for any resulting conversations. However, this is a very family friendly if heavy on the sap movie.

Do I suggest Watching -- YES",1430524800,,1170,4.4485981308411215

I wouldn't exactly describe it as ""uplifting"" which is a quote from the movie description I read.  I'm very partial to true stores and this is a true story.  You become completely involved with the main character.  She does an amazing job of acting and is totally and completely believable.  The woman who plays her mother also does a great job of acting.  It's a story of a young girl's extremely difficult struggle with a dope addict Mom and going through the foster care system.  In spite of the unfair disadvantage she starts out with and having all odds against her, with the help of some good people she succeeds at achieving a happy ending.  Maybe that was the intended meaning of the use of the word ""uplifting'?  I would definitely recommend this movie.",1428364800,,874,4.660130718954249

6235409,5,B00HW3EY46,"I have several friends who were the male version of the main character. The only difference is that men don't have the challenge of pregnancy. The movie shows that homelessness often happens due to tragic life circumstances that are beyond the victims control. When a teenager gets pregnant without support, the outcome is often tragic. The movie is realistic and doesn't sugarcoat reality. Acting is great and the ending is bittersweet. l highly recommend this movie regardless of whether you're familiar with the issues of teenage pregnancy, homelessness, or poverty. It will challenge you , sadden you, and warm your heart. The next time I walk past a homeless person seeking assistance, l will be more aware and willing to help than before.",1426896000,,744,5.056910569105691

6235448,5,B00HW3EY46,"Vanessa Hughes is an amazing actress and brings forth a realistic portrayal of a sixteen-year-old who had to raise herself for all her youth up until shes pregnant and flees an abusive mother who led the same life on the streets being pregnant that Apple is destined to follow.
 The minister, portrayed my James Earl Jones is the key to Apple's rebellious and troubled turn-around during her pregnancy. Her salvation begins when he tells her to read verses from the Bible. I see that as her change, yet she has far to go. The unwed mother's home is a Godsend for Apple and her baby, but I must be an optimist, for I believe Apple's father does have feelings for his daughter. He has tears for the daughter he never knew up until this point. While it is true that his wife is a snob, he is the father and a new grandfather and wants to make up for the time he lost with his daughter. The letter Apple reads from him as a young man was filled with regrets of his youth. He still wants to be there for her. Partly from guilt and partly from wanting to make amends and be a real father to a daughter he was never allowed to see or know.
When he returned Apple to the unwed mother's home, I thought it was a big negative, when the other girls seemed to want to keep her there only for what? To be best friends raising babies without families or a father, without hope. Being a mother is a serious matter, not the life of dorm roommates.
The home was a lifesaver to be sure, but I felt the other young mothers should have rejoiced that Apple's father wanted to make a better life for his daughter and form a father/daughter and even a granddaughter relationship. Forget his wife. He came off as sincere in his intentions or he would have left her at the home to begin with.
Of course, the viewer does not know what happens after the credits roll and what's in the mind of the writer, but I wonder if Apple ends up on the streets again just like her mother and then she would loose her baby forever. I felt she should never have gone back to the home for unwed mothers. Not to mention, her biological mother knows she's there and would likely return for her. Since the movie was based in part on true lives of this particular teen, I will never understand why Apple chose to return to the home. She told her father that she would contact him when she was ""ready."" All the while, the mother of Apple looms like a dark cloud of what could be a disaster of an ending. This was a great movie and the actors delivered powerful performances.",1426896000,3,2528,4.277661795407098

This is one I might even re-watch and I almost never do that, and I will recommend it to others who want a little depth or meaning with their popcorn.  There were a few elements that bothered me, like xxxx was overdone or xxxx should be more complex, but these are all petty when you consider everything all together and add up to a big ""yeah but so what"" about that when I consider the whole.  The realistic relationship with the mother really gets me- frankly I don't think I have ever seen a more realistic character anywhere than the girls' mother in this.  People are not simple, and I don't think anyone has ever been able to show so clearly in just a few minutes the good and bad in a person battling against each other.  I wish the writer could have nailed the ending the way he nailed the complex character of that mother in just a few minutes of screen-time.

6235775,5,B00HW3EY46,"Wow! I put this movie on my ""watch"" list thinking I might check it out. Time passed and I kept skipping over it. The other day I finally decided to watch it. I have to say I was quite surprised and very happy I did. This IS a good movie and the acting is excellent. Vanessa Hudgens shows she has serious acting skills. Rosario Dawson also gives an excellent performance and shows us why she is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. Over all, a solid film that will take you on an emotional roller-coaster and ends with hope and joy.

Side note: Gimme Shelter addresses a topic many in our society do not want to hear or talk about. Teen pregnancy. This movie shows the background that many of these at-risk teens come from and the struggles they go through to get help and break unhealthy cycles. Honestly, many of these women are courageous. They are in horrible situations and lack solid support structures (some have backgrounds where family and society have failed them) but selflessly choose the good of their child. It also shows how broken and unfeeling parts of our society have become. I also ""tip my hat"" to faith-based shelters and programs. I know there are many caring people working in government-run programs but these services are limited, poorly run, abused and overwhelmed. When these services fail it is faith-based shelters and programs that step up to the plate, and they should be commended and supported.",1426291200,2,1440,4.714285714285714

6236271,3,B00HW3EY46,"This movie exhibited a whole lot of craziness.  The reason her step-mother was acting so crazy is because her irresponsible dad didn't tell his wife that he had a child before entering college with another woman & she didn't want her two small children to think that it's ok to get pregnant as a teenager.  In these type of movies, why is the irresponsible dad always made to be rich, successful, living in a mansion with a beautiful wife & children while the woman he got pregnant in his youth is poor & living is a drug infested poor neighborhood?

This movie sends several wrong messages: 1. A man can date a woman a few times, get her pregnant & abdicate all responsibility.  2. The mother is a drug addict yet is able to keep her child.  3. A man can continue to abdicate responsibility even when his teenage child shows up at his doorstep. 4. A step-parent can make an appointment for a 16 year old girl to have an abortion without the girl's consent. What happened to right to life?  Couldn't the option be giving the baby up for adoption?  5. This film makes it look like being pregnant for 9 months, giving birth & taking care of a baby no big deal, a breeze.

This film shows us that our states' children & families government agencies are a failure since a child would continually be returned to his/her drug addicted parent.

When is there going to be a movie that shows what it's truly like for a teenage girl to be pregnant for 9 months, give birth & take care of the baby.  Maybe if teenage boys & girls saw how difficult it is to be pregnant for 9 months, give birth & take care of a baby while going to school & work there wouldn't be so many teenage pregnancies.",1424131200,5,1680,4.321656050955414

Even if I agree with a premise, I absolutely abhor being preached to; that's just something that is part of me.  I don't do it to others, and I don't want it done to me.  This society talks out of both sides of its mouth; on one hand, anti-abortion/murder, but where is that compassion for the countless murders committed every day on the streets?  In fact, crime is big business as the pro-lifers think nothing of watching a murder flick or reading a crime book.  Prisons are big business and privatized to make a profit.  And how about pro-life being an easy belief when you are not walking in a desperate woman's shoes.  That is, women are responsible for birth control and then making the decision that will affect the rest of their lives.  How about society teaching its little boys to become men who share responsibility in contraception and we could eliminate the abortion issue almost entirely.  And how about these Catholic charities that help expectant mothers, but a religion that shelters a plethora of priest pedophiles who have ruined countless children's lives?  These religions, set up by men, for men, impose their morality without a hint of responsibility for the behavior of men in society or their own pedophile priests.  It's a society of hypocrites and double standards.  Yes, I am pro-life. But I would never be able to tell someone what to do with their pregnancy unless I'm willing to help raise that child myself.  Oppressive societies like ours tell women what they should do with their bodies; it's a misogynistic one, for sure.",1423958400,,1658,4.775438596491228

Gimmie Shelter is about a teenage girl who lives off an on again with her drug addicted mother. She has been in and out of foster homes for much of her life and one day gets fed up and searches out her father who wasn't around during her rearing because he was young, wealthy and had a one night stand type of deal with her mother. Her father has his own life now, complete with wife and children of his own, leaving his daughter feeling unwanted and burdensome, and top it off she finds out that she is pregnant...
Vanessa did a really good job with the role she was given,no Disney stuff here! I was really impressed.
Well I don't want to say too much, but this film isn't bad at all, I even felt a little teary during some scenes.

The story is very credible because when you are a teenager or young adult and based on the type of life that you have had- aggression becomes a byproduct.  If you want to experience raw emotions- definitely watch this movie.  I always give movies a try, even with 1 star reviews, because I want to be the judge for myself.

6236324,1,B00HW3EY46,"The main character is a young woman from a troubled home who gets pregnant and ends up in one of those pregnancy crisis centers with a lot of other young, pregnant girls. All of the girls in the crisis center have horrible stories of abuse, neglect and abandonment, just like our heroine. After some left and right she, ditches her cracked out mom and forms a relationship with her wealthy but absent father who graciously allows her to stay in his mansion with her new born once she decides to choose life.

So, here's a few issues with this. I really didn't have an issue with the whole mom/boyfriend/runaway thing because I know people who were in exactly the same position and it really doesn't seem all that far from the truth. they do recite the tired cliche of her mom wanting to keep her and her baby for welfare benefits. But, everyone else does too so, meh.

The first issue I had was with the girls at the crisis pregnancy center. Each and every one had a long history of substance, emotional and physical abuse; Many had been sexually assaulted and many had psychological problems. Remember, that was their ""stories"" and I say that because this in no way impacts how any of them react to anything. Instead of being the damaged, messed up emotionally stunted, suicidal, junkies that I spent much of my youth with, they are all well adjusted, caring, loving, sharing, open individuals who all come to love the idea of having a baby when they're in their early teens. BS, total and absolute BS So much BS you have to be an idiot to buy it.

The second issue that I have is the whole dad thing. She tracks down her dad who is rich and successful, living in the requisite mansion, with the requisite new wife and kids and the requisite lots of money. Absolutely no mention is made of how he hooked up with the main characters skanky mom or how he managed to avoid getting shaken down for money all these years. Realy? She is happy for the new grand kid because it means more welfare money but she's never heard of child support? Again, absolute and total BS.

So, dad and step mom  do what any rational, reasonable person would do and they arrange for their newly found and quite psychotic daughter to have an abortion. The trip to the abortion center is even more BS. The step mom is basically shown as forcing her to do this. The abortion center is a caricature, but not as bad as what I was expecting. It's  just shown as cold and unfeeling and bureaucratic with everyone being in a hurry to murder that baby and move on to something else. Not quite so much BS but BS none the less.

Blah, blah, blah more total BS and a little conflict. I was looking forward to watching Rosario Dawson beat up a nun but even that was a no go. I suspect that she and Matt Damon did this movie as part of a plea deal.

Finally, when she decides to actually go ahead and have her baby, her dad, who previously was all in favor of abortion, has a sudden change of heart and sets her up in the spare house on his estate which he loads to the roof with baby stuff. Even step mom is on board with this new plan, for some baffling reason.

The moral of this story is that if you would only choose life, everything will be sooper awesum, kids!

This is stupid, patronizing, and pointless. Anyone familiar with the problems that ACTUAL pregnant teenagers face should be completely insulted by this movie and anyone with half a brain should immediately send a donation to planned parenthood with the name of this movie in the note line.

The pro-life movement should pay for people to watch this movie.",1419724800,19,3586,4.409984871406959

6236355,5,B00HW3EY46,"Vanessa Hudgens completely astounded me with her performance as Agnes ""Apple"" Bailey in this heart-wrenching story written and directed by Ron Krauss and loosely based on a true story.  As this movie's title really exclaims it all, ""Gimme Shelter"" is more of a desperate cry from an abused and abandoned sixteen-year-old girl for the stability she has never known.  According to Agnes, the proof is right in her hand as she slaps the letter down onto her father's, Tom Fitzpatrick (Brendan Fraser), high-end and  stylish dining room table. In plain text, she is the 'Apple of his eye'.  He wrote this to her, then why did he leave her with a drug addicted and abusive mother, June (Rosario Dawson), to basically fend for herself?

Agnes has been shuffled around from ten different foster homes by the young age of twelve, even being left behind by June while she was imprisoned for her drug habit at the tender age of just eight years. Her mother just up and leaves her on a whim.  As her own mother showed neither love nor stability for her, she finally comes to the cutting-off point.  She hacks off her long locks of hair and dares to make a change.  Agnes runs away in a painful scene, provoking a drugged, disheveled, and volatile June along with a taxi driver who shows no compassion for the teen either while tossing her from the vehicle.

She does arrive at her father's home, although is clearly unwelcome there also, even with the letter. This single piece of paper that gives her a past, a family, and a person who claimed to love her - way back when.  Agnes refers to herself from this point as ""Apple"" in an attempt to form a brand new identity through her father's eyes.  Now he refuses to see that she has had to raise herself without him.  In the meanwhile, Tom and his wife, Joanna (Stephanie Szostak) have been busy with their own upscale family life. It's clear as their crystal that Joanna neither wants the reminder of her husband's left-behind child nor her sudden return...but Apple is pregnant.  This family is ill-equipped to help toward anything positive with Apple at this point and again she bolts. Apple is so used to running all of her life, she has no solid place to land.

In a painful twist, Apple winds up homeless, wandering, and then hospitalized.  Just when you think that things could never get remotely better for her, and Apple is going to give up, she meets Father Frank McCarthy (James Earl Jones) and begins the long haul to recovery.  This is the point that the movie really begins and she can now see the light at the beginning of the tunnel.  Apple trudges onward with many more young women like herself all in the journey towards a life.

This movie grabs you with its honest character portrayals and its unrelenting reality.  The pain of Apple's truth is excruciating until life begins to begin for her in a way she creates for herself along with loving guidance...and she is not alone any longer.",1413849600,22,2945,4.618042226487524

It's a very deep and sadly twisted story line--almost like watching a slow motion train wreck, yet you can't look away. Vanessa Hudgens plays this tough-girl who's gone through more in her short life than any of us can imagine, but who is really broken, vulnerable, yet so strong when faced with protecting her own child. I loved how this story showed both sides of what this kid is going through. You could see how it would be easy for her to make different choices and it really makes you think about people's inner strength. The story and how this girl practically rescues herself while growing up and being faced with an unplanned baby while she's just on the verge of being a woman herself is really great.

I like that such a horrible beginning has a happy ending. This is a masterpiece on the difference between the lowest class of people, and the 1% of wealthy people. No matter what class you find yourself in, the only thing that matters is that you find a way in your heart to help those that are less fortunate. Of course, there are people that devote their time, talent, and resources to a specific cause. You really have to have a heart and be fearless, and that is exactly what the leader of the unwed mothers' shelter was. She started out like them, pregnant and poverty-stricken. She picked herself up by her bootstraps and found a way to help women that were pregnant and had no where else to go. And let me hammer the point: she was not a pushover. She didn't let the girls or anybody else manipulate her. The point of this story is to never judge a book by its cover and to help others, even when it is hard or not convenient.",1409443200,,1088,4.31219512195122

There are reviews that pan this movie for being pro-life and refer to it simply as propaganda.  I did not even consider that until,I read those reviews.  In retrospect I supposed they could be correct that this movie has pro-life themes in that many characters in the movie choose a different path other than abortion, which is a pro-choice position.  However, those critics seem to dismiss the qualities of this movie because they believe it is a piece of propaganda.  This is not the first movie that has tried to convey a message.

Despite the dismissal of the movie on political grounds I judge the movie based on the high production value, a riveting story, the desperate circumstances of a teenage girl who makes a brave choice and is supported for it, and Hudgon and Rosario's strong and daring work.  Also, I judge it by the reaction of my 15 year old daughter who grew up on a diet of Vanessa Hudgon fueled Disney movies.

Apple (Vanessa Hudgens) is a 16 year old girl discarded by society and thrown on its refuse pile. In order to get off the heap and change her life around, Apple must take the first step and decide to change her life. She leaves her abusive mother (Rosario Dawson) and seeks out the father she never knew (Brendan Fraser). Dad is understanding, willing to help, but is not loving especially when he finds out Apple is with child.

Apple wants to have the child against her dad's wishes and through a series of circumstances finds herself in a girl's shelter where she experiences the first love and trust she has ever had in her life.

This is perhaps the best film entitled ""Gimme Shelter"" without Mick Jagger. Her decision at the end should have been better developed, showing a defining turning point. Brenden Fraser's character was a cut out and could have been more animated. Was that slick hair and awful suit how he really looked and dressed?

6236736,3,B00HW3EY46,"Written and directed by Ronald Krausse, Gimme Shelter proves that good intentions and earnestness alone cant guarantee the quality of a film.

The screenplay is based on the true story of a 16-year-old girl who goes by the name Apple (the talented Vanessa Hudgens) whose life could easily have served as the basis for a  Dickens novel had it been set a century-and-a-half in the past. Born to an abusive, drug-addicted single mother (an uglied-up Rosario Dawson) who wants her daughter around only for the welfare checks she brings in, Apple has been kicked around from one foster home to the next, when she isn't trying to re-connect with her uber-rich biological father (Brendan Fraser) or living on the streets, that is.

Krausse sure pours on the pathos and the suffering, but the movie as a whole isn't as compelling as it should be, partly because, while there is a certain grittiness in the look and feel of the picture, the episodic nature of the tale doesnt allow for any real development of the secondary characters, leaving them stereotypical and flat. They simply remain off-screen for too long a time to register much of an impact on the audience. Apples absurdly callous step-mother (Stephanie Szostak) and a kindly priest (James Earl Jones), who offers the hand of friendship to Apple in her time of greatest need, feel particularly two-dimensional and under-developed. Moreover, the dialogue frequently undercuts the naturalism of the piece by having the characters spell out in words rather than through indirection and action what it is were supposed to be taking away with us from the movie.

All those who made Gimme Shelter definitely had their hearts in the right place, but I think this is one of those instances where a little less fidelity to the actual story and a little more focus might have resulted in a more effective drama.",1400112000,,1855,4.898089171974522

The movie showcases the help as being Christian without equal acknowledgement to other beliefs or that none should be promoted as part of help. Helping a person does not mean imposing my value system as an underlying subterfuge within that help.

6236741,5,B00HW3EY46,This was an amazing performance by Vanessa Hudgens. This movie really stirred me as I realized how truly divided we are in this current society. Totally an eye-opener! The movie graphically depicts the plight of the true victims trapped between the two extremes of street and suburb who are trying to survive and escape the misery with many falling through the cracks. The hopelessness and ruin of the street and the greed and selfishness of the suburb were a true revelation to me of the growing rift between the mingled peoples of our country and the long-held traditions of our established society. It is truly becoming a desperate situation boiling to explosive consequences. The solution was exemplified by pure-hearted interventionists who held to honestly- motivated compassion and a genuine desire to help.

Vanessa Hudgens does a great job at playing the role of the troubled pregnant teen, making a very solid believable character in her role.  Rosario Dawson even though she is limited in the amount of screen time that she has in the movie, is great and very believable in her role as the drugged out mother.  The makeup given to the characters makes their personas even more believable.

Based on true events, the story is believable enough although at time seems to get bogged down in its own story but even so, this movie is solid overall with very good portrayals that make up for the weaknesses in the story.

6236822,5,B00HW3EY46,"There are real people out there like Agnes ""Apple"" Bailey, the 16-year old girl who runs away from her abusive mother at the start of the film ""Gimme Shelter,"" only to end up pregnant and homeless on the streets of New York. But Apple, portrayed convincingly by a near-unrecognizable Vanessa Hudgens, is only one highlight of this film.

Excellent performances are also found with the sympathetic Father McCarthy (James Earl Jones) and the abusive mother (Rosario Dawson) who influence the direction of Apple's life. And Kathy DiFiore, the compassionate social worker (Ann Dowd) who takes in Apple, is portrayed with great compassion. After trading an abusive marriage for homelessness, the real-life DiFiore founded the ""Several Sources"" homeless shelters for pregnant teens that inspired this little indie film.

Bottom line: This movie is the absolute best pro-life film I've ever seen. It's more high-quality that low-budget Protestant stuff like ""October Baby."" It's also more realistic than ""Bella"" since it's based on a true story. Although ""Bella"" is a powerful and moving film, it's also a whimsical fiction, whereas ""Gimme Shelter"" gets added grit from its basis in real life. It is a labor of love.

Both ""Bella"" and ""Gimme Shelter"" are Catholic films, but ""Gimme Shelter"" feels more real, more heartfelt, and more immediate to the experience of young people growing up in a world of haves and have-nots.

It's also one of the best social justice films I've ever seen, giving an amazingly sharp depiction of teenage homelessness that riveted my theology students when we watched the film together. They are usually pretty immune to any sort of ""care about the world"" message. But this film, maybe because Vanessa Hudgens was in it got to them. ""Gimme Shelter"" has the biting realism of ""Dead Man Walking"" without any of the moral sermonizing.

This DVD includes a brilliant transfer with 5.1 audio, deleted scenes with director's commentary, a ""making of"" featurette,and the usual Spanish subtitles. It's a great package of a great indie film. I highly recommend it.",1399248000,14,2077,5.1513353115727005
6236823,4,B00HW3EY46,I loved this movie. The value of anything is always in the people. This movie showed me what it really is like to live on the streets and what it takes to survive and how a caring nonprofit can really help the street kids.,1399248000,,222,4.068181818181818
6236824,5,B00HW3EY46,Highly recommend Gimme Shelter. It's a story of misguided love and repentance inspired by actual events. Rosario Dawson's performance is so amazing in this film. She plays a strong out addict mom trying to hold on to her kid for all the wrong reasons. She lost weight for the role and her teeth are dull.

6236856,2,B00HW3EY46,"Vanessa Hudgens plays Agnes Apple Bailey, a pregnant teen who escapes her previous life of abuse and mistreatment at the hands of her drug-addicted mother (Rosario Dawson).  Apple seeks refuge in a shelter built specifically for pregnant teenagers, and while there, builds relationships with the other girls as she learns more about herself and what it means to really be part of a family.

If you read that synopsis and thought to yourself, Wow, that sounds like itd be a pretty good movie, youd be absolutely right.  The movie, unfortunately, fails to deliver any more substance than whats given in my previous paragraph.  Gimme Shelter is, if you will, one of those examples of something that sounds good on paper, but translates poorly to the screen (similar to how I feel about most book adaptations).

Typically in a Drama you get:
1) Setup
2) Dramatic build-up,
3) Resolution.

Any good film in this genre will follow this formula.  Its Storytelling: 101.  Gimme Shelter does a lackluster job of producing much, if any, dramatic build up.  There is a lot of arguing going oncharacters yelling at each otherbut for the most part, thats the extent of the films dramatic build-up.  Several times during the film, the characters are faced with a serious dilemmas (Apple being forced to go to an abortion clinic, for instance), but they are almost immediately resolved with no dramatic build-up.

One instance of good dramatic build-up was between Apple and her mother, but in this situation there wasn't much of a resolution which left me feeling cheated.  I thought, The one time you get the dramatic build-up right, you give me no resolution.

This film might be worth watching if you want to see great performances by Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Hudgens, but nothing more because itll leave you feeling a bit incomple

6236857,3,B00HW3EY46,"IF you have never been abused....never lived the life....then this movie might give you an idea. However, these kids.....who at times can be feral as ""apple"" is on the outside.....but inside they want to be loved and want a family and want everything that they should have had. Its realistic to find yourself attached to a parent who is out of control and yet the system keeps letting this parent be a parent to an innocent child.... thus perpetuating the cycle. The drug dependent mom...is excited Apple is pregnant because ""mom"" will get all the money as apple is still a minor. It isn't until ""apple"" begins to speak up for herself that she begins to get away.....it isn't until she is old enough to have other options than the what the system offers to children.... does she find salvation. Yet many do not speak up for themselves. When you have not experienced love...a person confuses love and sex. Apple is no different and it is how she find herself pregnant at 16 just like her mother. However....the part where the movie tends to become unrealistic...showing Apple finding a open car (it rarely happens when your truly on the streets). She finds a bit of food in the car, water, and a blanket. Nobody moves the car either. (I was expecting the fairy God Mother to show up.....It also shows her eating out of a trash can.....but of course Apple doesn't get food poisoning. Another unrealistic side to really living on the streets as a kid.)  Then there is a rich dad. He has been indifferent to Apple for all of these years and suddenly Apple bursts into his life (pregnant). Why wasn't he paying child support? A Wall Street millionaire??? Really??? Apples step mom is more of the same....a manipulative liar....telling dad that Apple just ran away... However, rich nasty step mom actually abandons this moneyless pregnant teen at the doctors office. Then calls it a ""misunderstanding"" I will give the movie kudos for the dad telling Apple to just ""turn the page"". Forget about everything you have been through. That is just an insane way to look at things...when you haven't ever been abused or lived on the streets. One can't just ""forget"" those experiences.  I did find parts of the movie good but it was also a movie version of what the truth really is........ when your a teen on the streets. The movie is meant to give you the warm fuzzies. Make you feel like there is hope for teens who pick themselves up by the bootstraps and get out of the cesspool of drugs, abuse and poverty. Take it from this reviewer who's mom is an abusive heroin addict causing me to choose the streets for several months too at not nearly 13. Trust me, after horrid abuse...the streets are a welcome respite. Nobody has a rich dad....kids like this are the product of their parents environment. What we should be asking ourselves is how we allow crack addict mothers to continue to raise children....with a system that rewards them for having more children. Also a system that even gives more money if one of their minor girls gets pregnant. Exactly how does any of this help anyone?? It does not and has not. This movie gives you a taste of an abused welfare kid....but still it is shined up. Hardly at all what living on the streets is really like for a child on their own. What we should be asking....is how to help these children and keep them from repeating the same cycle as their parents. The home....that Apple finds herself is a good start. At least it opens dialogue about how to help.",1398816000,4,3489,4.616747181964573

6236859,4,B00HW3EY46,"""Maybe you're exactly where you need to be."" Apple (Hudgens) is a pregnant teenager who escapes her abusive mother (Dawson) and goes to New Jersey in search of her father. After she finds him things don't go as planned. Neither him or his wife think Apple should have the baby so they bring her to a clinic. Knowing that isn't what she wants Apple runs from there and winds up homeless living on the streets and out of garbage until she is taken to a shelter for young pregnant women. Finding that place changes her entire life. After watching the trailer for this I thought I was prepared for how heavy the movie was gonna be. I wasn't. The movie is hard to watch in some parts and knowing that this is based on a true story makes it that much more powerful. The best part and the reason to watch though is Vanessa Hudgens. She so inhabits this character that you forget it's her. She is in a movie with Rosario Dawson, Brendan Fraser and James Earl Jones and they all struggle to keep up with her. The movie does have the feel of Precious and movies like that so it's not one you can watch over and over but it should be viewed at least once if for no other reason then to see Vanessa Hudgens' performance. Overall, a good and powerful movie with a career making performance by Vanessa Hudgens. I give this a B.",1398643200,,1313,4.298387096774194
6236860,5,B00HW3EY46,"This movie was awesome! I saw it at the cinema and was so moved by it. I left with a restored hope in humanity, knowing that there are people like Kathy DiFiori doing what they are doing to help right the many things wrong in our world today.
Vanessa Hudgens and Rosario Dawson blew me away! Their characters are so authentic. I was intrigued by every scene and new development in the story. I don't want to give any of it away, there was just SO much in this story that I loved. Many attack it and I honestly can't fathom why!? It's so well acted, real and professional. So exciting, moving, inspiring, and enlightening. It's not a well-known film but I hope that will change! I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
Cannot wait till my DVD copy gets here so I can show it to everyone I know!
We need more real stories like this. I will never forget it.",1398556800,2,861,4.320987654320987
