8532266,3,B008XTVX0G,"Cute movie, not great, but fun to watch.  The opening sequence with credits is quite interesting to watch with couples dancing to the 1929/1930 music.  Sue Carol did not make many films after this, but if I'm not mistaken became involved in behind-the-scene portion of film making.  She also married actor Alan Ladd.  The main song ""The Kiss Waltz"" is very pretty and danceable.  They sing it several times in the movie.  I read recently another song was cut from the film before release, ""Dancing With Tears In My Eyes"" which became a big hit in 1930 with recordings by many of the top orchestras of the day.  Too bad the producers didn't keep that song in the film.  Tommy
Forgot to mention, Grant Williams, the male lead in this film, was married at the time to 17-year-old Loretta Young.  Marriage was annulled by her mother during this same period.  Williams was cocky and obnoxious and not very likeable.  There's one very funny scene when Carol's role brings him home to meet her mother.  Mother says something to the effect:  ""Where'd you find this thing?""  They thought she was referring to a dance cup they won, but mother added:  ""No, I mean him.""",1377561600,2,1158,4.635467980295567
