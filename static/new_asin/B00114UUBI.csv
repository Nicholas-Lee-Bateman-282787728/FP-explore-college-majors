8240372,5,B00114UUBI,Great video that's entertaining and informative for middle school science students.,1435190400,,83,6.636363636363637
8240373,4,B00114UUBI,"This was pretty informative,  but at times repetitive.  My son loves prehistoric animals and any TV program or movie keeps his attention. This program did but wasn't deemed interesting enough to be added into the constant loop phase. The program tried too hard to create a sense of drama (was the baby mammoth a boy or girl - stay tuned!) when it wasn't necessary.",1418342400,,364,4.671875
8240374,5,B00114UUBI,"I have just ordered this interesting dvd and hope it will arrive soon.
I read about the story of this astounding baby mammoth, frozen in the snow of Siberia thousands of years ago, and was discovered by the local tribesmen called Dongon. Research should be handled in Russia and NOT in any other country which would NOT  be expected to share the secrets...! However, let's  hope that  the result of the crucial tests including DNA on this ""Ice Baby"" will be eventually  shared openly to the whole world. There shouldn't be any hold back of the so-called ""scientific secrets"", by any country which has this baby...!!!
Cheers...!",1240704000,,627,4.831775700934579
8240375,4,B00114UUBI,"The discovery is amazing, the science is wonderful, the scientists were filled with rosy-cheeked enthusiasm, high spirits, and good sportsmanship, but the thing that really makes this DVD work is the computer-generated baby mammoth who runs amok in the documentary, at one point stealing the truck keys out of the pocket of a scientist examining the 35,000-year-old baby mammoth find, and then flinging the keys away where the scientists couldn't find them.  The entire documentary is dotted with moments of humor and excitement and is a step above similar documentaries.  Much of the credit for this must go to the researchers, who seem absolutely delighted to be working on the discovery, and who project so much excitement for their work.  Included in the DVD is a discussion of the ethics of using mammoth DNA to ""resurrect"" mammoths as a clone or hybrid (using modern elephants as the ""medium"").  Seeing the adorable and mischievous little mop-top in the movie can make it seem very desirable to bring them back.  But before humans start fooling around with processes much larger and more complex than we can possibly understand fully, it might be good for us to consider that organisms go extinct for a reason...and that reason might make it unethical and even cruel to bring an extinct organism back for reasons of our own.",1229299200,7,1330,4.972972972972973
