8559277,5,B00AYLJO4S,"I enjoyed this film because it explains the history behind one of our nation's most significant achievements - the building of the transcontinental railroad. Plus, it is an absolute hoot to watch. It is an informative must-see for not only casual train enthusiasts, but U.S. history buffs as well. What I found particularly interesting is the fact that the vision of five men - Mark Hopkins, Charles Crocker, Collis Huntington, Theodore Judah and Leland Stanford - paved the way to not only the creation of the railroad, but the positive socio-economic impact it had on the entire nation for generations to come.  This is why they named schools and art galleries after these guys. Producer Bill George artfully takes viewers back in time and places them in the White House next to President Lincoln as he signs the Pacific Railway Act of 1862; behind the scenes as the first investments were made to fund the project; through the canyons and mountains where track would be laid; a seat at the campfire to taste the nightly grub from the chuckwagon; next to the thousands of dedicated workers who did the heavy lifting; amid various trials that could have threatened the project - and right up to a special ceremony that christened the new railroad seven years later and thus signaled the beginning of modern America's transformation. After seeing this film, I felt like I spent a week out on the range!  Also, the overhead shots of the canyons are cool. Suitable for all ages, especially young adults.",1379980800,,1501,4.859375
