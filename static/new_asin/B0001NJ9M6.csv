8436813,5,B0001NJ9M6,Al does a great job of explaining how to do the turns. I got a lot out the DVD.  Marcus,1297641600,,87,3.35
8436814,1,B0001NJ9M6,"I have danced for quite sometime, grown up with the dance and have taken lessons. This DVD medium for presenting classes is great becuase you to skip and play again and again the parts you need. No need in stoping a class in session of 30-50 people. The advantages of the DVD Medium don't work out well in this DVD. First Al is just to much into trying to make you laugh at slap stick humor. If I try to skip it, I have to fastforward which makes things annoying becuase the bad humor is at the begining of a new step. The moves in this DVD aren't many. I'd have to say the DVD is made up of 70 % moves and 30% useless humor that is old the first time around.

Bottom line: I don't recomend this to anyone looking to get their bang for their buck. You will learn more from one night a club watching reasonable good dancers do some stylish spins. Avoid this DVD if your not willing to part with $40 just for the heck of it.",1106611200,,922,4.038251366120218
8436815,3,B0001NJ9M6,"I bought this DVD specifically to learn how to do multiple spins.  It was helpful, but it didn't produce any revelations or dramatic improvements.  I learned a lot from Al's excellent shine video.  Perhaps I was expecting too much from this DVD.

There were no secret techniques for keeping your balance or getting more rotation. The first half of the DVD taught some very basic turn technique that you would learn in a beginning salsa class.  His prep step to the side actually made turning more difficult, because it added another 1/4 spin to a single right turn.

The second half of the DVD did show some nice turn patterns with a partner (Edie, the Salsa Freak).  Edie's spins were effortless.  I haven't seen her spin DVD, but it may be a better bet.",1102982400,,755,4.582089552238806
