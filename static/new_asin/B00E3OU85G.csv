The music is beautiful, adore strings...but maybe just a bit more variety in the musical themes might be good for such a long series. Really top notch acting, every single one of them! They seem so incredibly real. Just can't say enough good things, WATCH IT!!!!",1406937600,19,370,4.537313432835821

5888109,5,B00E3OU85G,Spanish with English Subtitles but Fantastic Series.  My husband and I got hooked on this series and didn't want it to end even though we don't speak Spanish.  After the second season ended we looked it up on Youtube and watched the Spanish Version without subtitles.  We garnered enough to enjoy it.  Now we miss Alicia and Julio.  We wanted it to go on forever! It is a great series our only hope is that they will overdub it in English.,1406678400,14,439,4.37037037037037
5888110,5,B00E3OU85G,"I clicked on this on Netflix not realizing it was in Spanish with English subtitles. Never have liked subtitles and never dreamed I would get so quickly hooked on this. I switched from watching on our big screen to my laptop because, on the big screen, I kept getting distracted by the drama and missed the subtitles. On my laptop, it was easy to see both. Couldn't stop watching. Even my husband got hooked--unfortunately, because I had to keep filling him in on what he missed. Can't wait for season 3.",1406419200,65,504,4.549450549450549

5888112,5,B00E3OU85G,"This TV series, was such a pleasant surprise, When a drama peaks your interest right from the
start, the sub-titles are worth the extra minute. It's the story that is important.
This series kept me interested and intrigued. Just when you thought it was going to get a little boring it
snapped you back with a surprise twist. I stayed up till 3AM for a couple of nights not wanting to stop watching.
Now of course I'm so bummed it doesn't have the 3rd season on Netflix or Amazon although it shows that there is
a 3rd season on IMDB but can't find out where I can watch it.",1405468800,89,572,4.256880733944954
5888113,5,B00E3OU85G,Loved this TV series it is over the top at times but so much fun. Yon Gonzalez and Amaia Salamanca look good together and the who dun it theme keeps your interest. I do wish they would make it in an English dubbed version. Netflix has 2 seasons and there is a 3rd season but it is not available right now. It was more daring and interesting and not as predictable as Downtown Abbey. Cant wait to see season 3.,1405123200,117,409,4.125

5888116,5,B00E3OU85G,"I got hooked on this during the first episode, which I just happened upon on Netflix.  From then on I was staying up until 3 in the morning watching.  I couldn't turn it off.  Great acting, beautiful scenery, and the juiciest story of all time.  Subtitles don't even distract.  Can't wait for Season 3 - calling Netlix customer service first thing tomorrow to request.",1431561600,,368,4.6875
5888117,5,B00E3OU85G,"Have never before been so captivated by a show.  Great characters and acting.  Fun to listen to the Spanish and find myself understanding more and more Spanish words and phrases.  After completing seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix, I could not stop, so searched the Web until I found someones comment about entering the season and episode in Google and then selecting a site which would stream the Season 3 episodes.  I did this and have not watched all of the seasons, including season 3.  If you are searching for Season 3, google S03E01 and then select ""Watch online TV "" and select one of the options there.

Enjoy!",1430784000,,612,4.568807339449541
5888118,5,B00E3OU85G,This was the best historical drama series I've ever seen. WAY better than Downton Abbey! I can't wait to see season 3. I hope Netflix loads it soon.,1430352000,,148,4.321428571428571

5888120,5,B00E3OU85G,I can count on one hand the number of times I have watched more than one movie at a time - life is too short.  That all changed when I started watching the Grand Hotel.  I stayed up at least two nights until after 3:00 a.m.  Though there are many far fetched aspects and unrealistic circumstances - these are trivial in the context of this rich and emotional romantic drama.  PLEASE get the final Season 3 with English sub titles.,1428883200,2,430,4.3375

5888122,5,B00E3OU85G,"Like others here, I discovered this amazing show on Netflix and had to wait months before I found out what happened after the last episode on Netflix's schedule. It ended with a tremendous cliffhanger, well, two actually. Finally, I found a way to watch season 3, so I wanted to share it for others who are tired of waiting for the DVDs to come out with English subtitles or Netflix to finally have it. I will be among the first to buy a DVD set as soon as it's available. Meanwhile, check out http://www.clicknwatchonline.com/grand-hotel-s03e01/, http://www.clicknwatchonline.com/grand-hotel-s03e02/, http://www.clicknwatchonline.com/grand-hotel-s03e03/, etc. There are 14 episodes (each requires its own URL), each about an hour and 15 minutes. And the last episode was simply perfect. Though I was sad it was over, I thought it was great how they ended it, and I don't want to spoil it for anyone by describing what they did because it was such a clever surprisejust be sure you watch the whole last episode all the way to the end, including the credits, and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Who knew Spain was the producer of such high-quality, such gripping drama, and amazing and interesting characters played by equally amazing and interesting actors? I was so inspired by hearing the language, I decided to learn it (again). Though I'm still not fluent, I can now understand at least half of the Spanish in Gran Hotelas long as there are subtitles. :) The ins and outs of the plot were surprising and often fun and even funny though it revolved around the death of the family patriarch and a serial killer so most of it was fairly serious with a touch of Sherlock Holmes, Spanish style. The romance between Julio and Alicia was compelling and wrenching. But the music, the costumes, the setting, and scenery, it was all just stunning. I have watched it over and over to help me get this great Spanish in my head. At least that's my excuse. LOL

Enjoy! No te arrepentirs.",1428710400,6,1981,4.8579881656804735
5888123,5,B00E3OU85G,I have viewed all episodes of Gran Hotel seasons 1 and 2 in Spanish with English subtitles. I am really looking forward to seeing season 3. When? Where?,1428192000,,152,4.464285714285714

5888127,5,B00E3OU85G,I was also stumped that Netflix did not offer the complete series.  Why would Netflix offer a series without it's final season?  Not too respectful of its subscribers in my view.  It is such a high quality production from the actors to the writers and so sophicticated.  So season 3 is actually season 4 when it aired in Spanish TV Antena 3 and if you can follow the Spanish you can pay for watching the series at Antena3.com.,1427241600,,426,4.423076923076923

I think it is far and away better than Downton Abbey or any other similar show. I didn't mind the subtitles at all; I found it very easy to follow the text and watch the show at the same time. I'm dying to watch season 3 and can't believe it's impossible to find! And believe me, I looked multiple times and didn't give up easily. I appreciate the reviewer that suggested calling Netflix to request it. The number to call is (888) 638-3549. And people, you can call multiple times, you don't have to give up after one phone call.

There is a Season 3 post-Netflix, although I have not been able to find a version with English subtitles.

I will say (minor spoiler alert) that as Season 3 went on, the focus at times seemed to shift away from the love affair between Alicia and Julio, those long, lingering close-ups of the star-crossed lovers and a dark intensity overall that were more prevalent during the first two seasons -- and more towards the solving of various perplexing mysteries, with a few more comedic moments thrown in.",1413331200,2,739,4.865079365079365

5888170,5,B00E3OU85G,I just binged watched seasons 1 and 2 on netflix and now totally bummed out to find that season 3 is not available so was willing to buy on Amazon but I need English subtitles.  This is the most exciting and intriguing series that I have ever watched even more than Downton Abbey which I love.  It makes me a little crazy with all the twist and turns but so enjoyable.  I'm desperate to see season 3.,1411862400,,400,4.1688311688311686
5888171,5,B00E3OU85G,"Loved this show, and I also watched both seasons on Netflix with English subtitles. However, I'm seeing a lot of reviews stating they can't wait for season three. Unfortunately, what you see on Netflix is the entirety of the show and there are no remaining episodes out there. Originally airing in Spain, season 1 ran for 9 episodes, season 2 for 8, and the final season for 20. Some of the episodes were reformatted and because seasons 2 and 3 were taped in the same span of time, they were combined into one season here in the U.S. So yes, there are ""technically"" three season, but we have all the episodes over here squished into two.",1411689600,5,637,4.5

5888173,5,B00E3OU85G,"Netflix is up to their usual tricks of releasing incomplete seasons. Great if you want to annoy your viewers. I still haven't gotten over Boss which they released when they knew the final season was cancelled.
How about a little more quality control and viewer sensitivity.
No series should be released unless they are complete.
I'm certain the Amazon will make season 3 with English subtitles available before Netflix.",1411430400,,419,5.086956521739131

5888177,5,B00E3OU85G,I came across this series on Netflix and was hooked by the end of the first episode- even with English subtitles. The story is intense and the acting magnificent- with a setting that quite matches Downton Abbey! A very well written thriller/ love story / family drama that keeps you guessing even when you think you know the plot. Recommending it to all my friends and family who like Downton Abbey genre! When is season 3 coming?!,1411084800,,431,4.6103896103896105

5888187,5,B00E3OU85G,"I discovered this wonderful series on Netflix and absolutely could not stop watching it until all of season one and two were completed. The acting in every episode is absolutely fabulous, The actors remain in character throughout,  presenting intense and emotional performances consistently. I found the directing and editing in this series was very superb and contributed totally to the consistency and delivery of such a passionate story. Although I don't speak Spanish and usually do not like subtitles,,the presentation in this series was very easy to follow and allowed me to watch the characters and absorb the meaning of each moment. As an American and a devoted follower of classic movies and excellent acting, it was highly refreshing to watch such a professional series void of foul language,  the exploitation of the macabre, and the total misrepresentation of passion.  After the second season ended I felt a sense of incompletion and had to order the third season on DVD. Unfortunately I did not realize that it did not have English subtitles. Although I watched it, I'm not exactly sure I could follow everything and hope that the third season will come out with English subtitles soon.",1409875200,47,1200,5.081218274111675

The characters are so believable and complex, the plot and setting have the potential to seem fake and soap-opera-esque, but, no, the writer of this show is brilliant and each plot twist flows perfectly and comes at the right time and lasts the perfect amount of time. The plot twists are all very surprising, nothing predictable about this show. Everything comes together in a beautiful and symphonic climax at the end of season 3, and now I WANT MORE! Everything you never thought would happen happened! And now I need to see season 3!!

I was able to watch the first couple of seasons on Netflix.  I'm happy to say they finally added the third and final season, so it's now available in it's entirety.  I am waiting for this to be available on DVD for Region 1.  When it is, I will purchase, as it's definitely a keeper!  As for now, I'm starting to re-watch and still finding little things I missed along the way.  This production is a joy to watch.  It's a shame we don't have more quality programs such as this one.",1441065600,,603,4.265486725663717
8600668,5,B00E3OU85G,"Call me crazy, but when Season Three was finally offered on Netflix, I not only watched it but started the whole series again from the first season to the very end and epilogue. For those that offer the comparison, this is much better than Downtown Abbey! There is never a dull moment. The plot is so complex that on second watching, I was often surprised. Granted, it is sewn up at the finale with some murderous characters ""getting away with it"" so you wonder if this is just reality or an oversight? The gorgeous hotel (a real castle) is really another character in the series, lovingly photographed from the exterior and grounds to the interior with its flocked wallpaper. The costumes show incredible detail from the complex white lace to black to a lovely dove gray that fits the monochrome palette of the hotel interior. The acting is truly marvelous with characters ranging from the creepy and evil to the heroic and angelic. Each episode ends on a cliffhanger that keeps you binge watching. The two romantic leads do more intense love making with a glance or a touch or a 'smoke'  than most current movies do with graphic tosses in bed. Lies, murder, sleuthing, debauchery, greed, stealing...all the deadly sins along with love, loyalty, generosity, friendship. You guessed it, in about a year I'll be at it again.",1437436800,6,1323,4.777292576419214

8600673,5,B00E3OU85G,"I just finished viewing season 3 of Gran Hotel.  Season 3 has tragedy, betrayal, murder, sacrifice, romance, and heartbreaking scenes.  Moments of humor, courtesy of Javier and Fernando, relieve the unrelenting roller coaster of emotions that will leave you angry, breathless or in tears. Two of the most villainous characters do receive what they deserve, but 2 other major characters do not.  Each is responsible for arranging or performing 2 murders, and yet in the finale of Gran Hotel both are given happy endings.  The most beloved characters; Alicia, Julio, Angela and Andres are also given happy endings, so I shouldn't complain.  Gran Hotel has been called Spain's Downton Abbey, and I have watched and thoroughly enjoyed all seasons of that story, too.  However, in my opinion, Gran Hotel is in a class all by itself. Wonderful and incomparable.",1432425600,3,855,5.115107913669065
