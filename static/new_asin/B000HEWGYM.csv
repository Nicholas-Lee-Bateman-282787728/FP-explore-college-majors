8139643,5,B000HEWGYM,"I thought I was going to watch a hiking trip to the highest point in South Pole, Antarctica but instead I got the history of the two other group of hikers who attempted this hike some hundred years ago where the Englishman group did not make it back but the other group, the Norwegians did plus some serious high altitude hiking. I got to see Antarctica the way I have not been able to with other DVDs. Isolated from others for some seventeen days, this group of hikers chose a new rout of hiking that nobody had tried before which was the face of the mountain. Extremely well done and informative documentary. Challenging hike to say the least in the coldest desert on earth as well as the highest continent on earth, a wilderness, a beautiful frozen continent. An amazing accomplishment. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1365033600,3,810,4.631944444444445
8139644,5,B000HEWGYM,"A combination of Mountaineering, Research, and First ascension. This trek takes on a face and approach that has never been attempted. I enjoyed this movie very much and it has plenty of good climbing.",1320278400,,200,4.911764705882353

8139646,5,B000HEWGYM,"NOVA delivers another fantastic show with this Antarctic expedition to one of the Seven Summits! Granted, I am already a big fan of NOVA, let alone when they cover my favorite topics (mountaineering!) Featuring Conrad Anker, Jon Krakauer, Dave Hahn, and assorted crew, they lug hundreds of pounds of gear up a new route on the east side of Vinson Massif, which, at a gain of over 12,000 feet (to a final altitude of 16,077 feet,) is no small task. This informative production examines some of the history of the exploration of the Antarctic continent, and addresses the future with scientific observations of ice equilibrium, as it pertains to global climate change. Jon Krakauer (already well known for his writing,) provides an interesting perspective and valuable knowledge of the climbing and expedition process. There is some spectacular footage of Antarctica in here. My only critique is that I would like some extras, maybe some cutting-room floor footage as an additional feature. I definitely recommend this DVD, along with NOVA's other mountaineering productions, such as ""Everest: The Death Zone,"" and ""Deadly Ascent,"" which examines the effects of altitude on climbers (on Denali.)",1166572800,11,1193,5.2513089005235605
