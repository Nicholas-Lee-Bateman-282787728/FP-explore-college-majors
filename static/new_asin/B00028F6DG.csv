2067906,5,B00028F6DG,Melissa DeLeo's wonderful teenage boobs. She plays the part of a deservedly successful hooker and I'm sure this led to subsequent Academy Award. Buy it.,1386806400,,152,5.12
2067907,3,B00028F6DG,"Streetwalkin' sure is an entertaining short movie and I'm glad that I purchased it.  The reason that I wanted this DVD was to see the magnificent and gorgeous Julie Newmar and I was not disappointed; she is in plenty of scenes and looks fabulous!

Witnessing the DVD cover and from reading summaries of the movie, I got the impression that the film was about a runaway girl who ends up becoming a prostitute in New York City.  While that does happen, the movie regrettably is more about her violent first pimp who crashes his way into just about every scene.  The plot also follows this pimp character during his separate strange scenes.

The picture is not very crisp and clean but is good enough for viewing at night.  It is widescreen for 16x9.  Beware:  this has a loud screechy soundtrack and often there are annoying clicks and pops that mostly come from the right speaker but there are a few on the left as well.  But you sure can hear everything.

The music selections are quite good and are songs that I've never heard of... I may look into purchasing some of them.

All-in-all I give it 3 stars.  Two stars only for overall DVD quality and an extra star for nice-looking, scantily-clad women.",1344988800,4,1202,4.565420560747664
2067908,4,B00028F6DG,"Great film in the tradition of Vice Squad (1982), Bad Boys (1983) and other ""life on the streets"" films of the early 80s.

Far superior to others in the genre such as the Angel trilogy.",1344297600,,185,4.285714285714286
2067909,4,B00028F6DG,"Well even Oscar winning actresses have to start somewhere and Melissa Leo who won an Oscar last year for the Fighter is no different. While also known for tv series like Cold Case and Homicide life on the streets Leo has done a lot of films over her 25+ year career. Street Walkin was only her 2nd film and she was around 25 years old when she did it. In the film the young and pretty Ms. Leo plays Cookie a teenage runaway now in the ""big apple"" along with her younger brother played by Randall Batinkoff( Kick Ass).Hanging around the Port Authority bus stop feeling down she's an easy mark for hustling pimp Duke (Dale Midkiff best known as the Dad in Pet Sematary).Duke seduces Cookie into working for him on the streets. This film came out 2 years after Vice Squad so you can see where the Duke character was modeled after Ram Rod from Vice Squad well no cowboy hat or boots for the Duke but you get the idea. After first being smitten with Duke Cookie sees the dark side of him when he kills another girl in his employ( also like in Vice Squad ) Taking the advice of veteran working girl Queen Bee ( the ageless Julie Newmar) Cookie decides to leave the employ of Duke. Fellow business man (read pimp) Jason takes a liking to Cookie and offers her a chance to switch employers. Jason is smooth and stylish but ruthless as well as he has some goons in his employ try and take care of Duke. They don't get the job done Duke is alive and looking for revenge on both Cookie and Jason. Cookie while aware that Duke wants to off her still has work to do and befriends Star(Khandi Alexander HBO's Treme.tv's News Radio and a slew of black themed 90's films) The final showdown between crazed Duke,angry Jason and Cookie,Queen Bee and Star comes in the ware house district. As far as the film goes it's really quite good .It's exploitation complete with nudity and sleaze but it rises above .It was shot on short money at night by 1st time Director Joan Freeman who only did one more film the similar Angel in red. In typical Concorde/New World style it's short,keeps the movie going and delivers what you came for. That would include some nudity from Ms. Leo for those interested in those sorts of things( show of hands) It's always fun seeing a successful actor when they first start out. Melissa Leo showed a lot of poise delivers her dialogue fine and looks good dressed as a hooker. Midkiff is a menacing presence as Duke you believe that he could be as nuts as he acts towards the end. Julie Newmar plays along as the aging hooker  who's there to offer guidance to the newbies. So if seeing a young Melissa Leo interest you and you like peeping into the world of pimps & ho's then I recommend Street Walkin it's a quality slice of 80's B movie madness.",1321401600,3,2755,4.380859375
2067910,4,B00028F6DG,"Judge Tom Becker, DVD Verdict-- Streetwalkin' is a strange little soup. In its opening minutes, it seems fairly clear that we're headed for Cautionary Tale territory, with the nave and fragile runaways seduced by the sinister Duke. The credits roll--with shots of the old, sleazy, and sometimes missed mid-80's Times Square while the hard-soul bit of '80s funk of a theme song plays--and we're certain that the next scene will be of poor Cookie being coerced into some bit of sexual degradation by the now-revealed-villainous Duke.

But no. Cookie's OK strolling the Minnesota Strip and acting like head cheerleader to Duke's football hero. She's taken on the ""mom"" role with Tim; the other working girls and street denizens form a scuzzy, yet functional, community. Street life is just shown as another way of life, and director and co-writer Joan Freeman takes a refreshingly nonjudgmental approach to the subject.

Freeman and company get a lot right here. The low budget--this is from Roger Corman's Concorde Films--meant that the crew couldn't build sets and had to shoot in real locations; thus, the gritty mid-80s Times Square/42nd Street milieu is front and center, making the film an authentic snapshot of scuzzy times gone by. While some of the sex-for-cash scenes are played kind of for laughs, there's nothing outrageous or ridiculous about them. It's edgy as opposed to exciting, more frank than sensationalized, though the requisite violence and nudity are there. Save for the pre-credit sequence in the bus station, the entire film takes place over the course of one night, making it sort of a Hooker Graffiti.

The thriller aspect is what keeps the film moving, but the well-developed characters make it interesting. Almost all the main actors went on to successful careers, a rarity in exploitation films; not surprisingly, then, the performances are quite good.

The disc, from Shout! Factory, offers up a decent anamorphic transfer but a kind of weak stereo audio track. As a supplement, there's a commentary from Freeman and producer and co-writer Robert Alden, who is also Freeman's husband.

2067911,5,B00028F6DG,"I was lucky to find a new-sealed version of this movie a couple of years back.  I originally saw this flick back in 1986 at the drive-in, but it was originally released in 1984.  The plot consists of a chararacter, by the name of ""Cookie"", who runs away from home with her younger Brother.  When she meets a pimp named ""Duke"", her life unravels on the meanstreets of New York.  It's directed by Roger Corman, and also stars Julie Newmar of ""Batman"" fame, and a very young Leon from ""Waiting To Exhale""-all in his jheri-curl glory!  I have the R-rated version, which is pretty violent in itself.  Although the plot utilizes the usual formula for this type of movie, it sure delivers and will not disappoint any fan of this genre.  If you like past movies released on TV and Theatrically like ""Dawn:Portrait Of A Teenage Runaway""('76), ""Little Ladies Of The Night""('77), ""Off The Minnesota Strip""('79), ""Vice Squad""('82), or ""Angel""('84), then it's guaranteed that you will like this movie.  I hope it gets released on DVD one of these days, but the Vestron VHS version looks great otherwise.",1169510400,8,1090,4.76063829787234
