Finally, a werewolf film with imagination! The story has more than enough surprises to make even the hard core horror fan happy, and i really hope they do a sequel!",1051228800,7,419,4.7534246575342465
1833712,1,B00008AOVO,"I bought this film because of a review I read.  The review said ""An American Werewolf in London"" + ""Dog Soldiers"" / ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""  But that was a complete a total lie.  The main promise was pretty good, but it was worked horribly.  This film has horrible actors, NO special effects, and Is just a horrible excuss of a horror movie.  And there is so much nudity and sex, that if I ran a video store i would have put this film in the adult section. NOT THE HORROR. DON'T BUY, DON'T RENT, DON'T PAY-PER-VIEW, Watch when (or if because if you cut out the nudity the film would be half an hour long) it comes on TV.",1050883200,12,619,4.125
1833713,2,B00008AOVO,"not a huge fan of werewolf movies but i do like The Howling, Wolfen, and Silver Bullet to name a few.  but this movie is not that good at all!!  obviously it will appeal to some of the younger generation but the movie concentrated on showing to much nudity and not enough well written action scenes.  did have a terrible story and was completely predictable.  while the werewolf was pretty well made, the movie was just not that good.  i know a lot of kane hodder fans will check the film out but don't expect anything great.  decent rent at best unfortunately",1050710400,3,560,4.4411764705882355
1833714,5,B00008AOVO,"Mix a lycanthropic fiend with a bunch of beyond belief sexy babes and what do we get?  DarkWolf, that's right.  This film ain't rocket science, but it sure got me going.  It's got some scenes that I watched a couple of hundred times, just because of the shwing appeal itself. Especially the two girl rooftop scene.  Wow!  It may only be T&A, but what T&A!  The wolf is cool too and the action sequences ain't half bad either.  This is a pretty damn good horror film when it comes down to it.  It's got everything it needs to take it's place in the B-movie horror hall of fame.  Like I said, it's definitely worth a look or even a couple of hundred.  Did I mention the rooftop scene?",1050624000,9,682,4.2578125
1833715,1,B00008AOVO,"First of all, when I rented Swimfan on video cassette, I saw the trailer for this movie. That was the first I had ever heard of ths movie at all. I kept checking the internet until this movie was released. I was very hyped for it's release, so hyped that I bought the movie the first chance I got.
 In the first 10 minutes you can tell that this movie is going to be bad. The acting is horrible, the way the movie is shot is even worse. There are times when you think you might be watching a porn movie or a soap opera, but it is supposed to be a movie.
 I have to admit there were times where I was very impressed with the direction the director took in showing so much attacking of the werewolf. That is a problem with big budget horror movies today. I say if you can make the werewolf look real with all of the money you have with a huge budget, then show the wolf attacking people most of the damn movie. There is a lot of nudity in this movie which is great, but no matter how much, it could not of saved this movie.
 There are some good actors in this movie. Josie, the girl that is supposed to complete the bloodline of the werewolves. Her friend which I think was in the one of the Wishmaster movies, and the woman from the Birds movie.
 The main problem about this movie is the directing. The script, dialog, and camera shots make it even worse. I don't watch a lot of so called B movies, but I now understand the meaning.
 One of the things I was most disappointed about was that on the DVD, the trailer that I saw from the Swimfan video was no where to be found.",1050537600,3,1573,4.061290322580645
1833716,2,B00008AOVO,"Werewolves...I love 'em.  I watch just about every werewolf film I can find looking for a quality lycanthrope movie.  This film isn't one of them.  I was encouraged by the positive reviews on this page to rent this movie and was highly disappointed.
The film is full of long, dry spells of poor dialog delivered by mediocre actors.  The werewolf itself is a man in an unconvincing, rubbery suit augmented by some video game quality CGI work.  If you still must see it, rent it before you shell out the money on buying it.  (It's much easier to waste $3 instead of $24.)
For some great werewolf action check out An American Werewolf in London, Ginger Snaps, or Dog Soldiers.  Any of these films are far superior.
Oh yeah, the only reason I gave this movie two stars is for the large amount of gratuitous nudity.",1050364800,4,810,4.506849315068493
1833717,5,B00008AOVO,"This is a very well done, very entertaining werewolf film, with a very original premise. It was a nice surprise to see Alexis Cruz (from Stargate), and especially Tippie Hedren, the star of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". I saw it on a friend's home theater, and it sounded absolutely great. I really liked the music for the rooftop scene - which is a scene to watch over and over again... It's the best movie you can watch with a group of friends. I can't wait for a sequel!",1050192000,10,468,4.390804597701149
1833718,5,B00008AOVO,"I may be in the minority here -- but as a female viewer, there's something about this movie that's oddly compelling.  I'm not normally a horror film fan, but a friend of mine made me watch this film with her, and I have to admit, I was ready to be offended -- but I wasn't.  I can't quite figure out what it is -- but there's something about this film that kept me watching until the end.  The lead actress gave a really sensitive performance -- I don't know who she is -- but she's going places.  She's sexy and the film as a whole is sexy.  Though the film is dark -- and extremely violent at times -- I did care for the kids in this film.  Most of all, it was entertaining -- and what more could one ask from a movie of this sort.  Who would have known a werewolf movie could be so intelligent.  Did I say that?",1049328000,13,814,3.9814814814814814
1833719,5,B00008AOVO,I sat through this movie twice (especially the rooftop scene with the two chicks)!  I've never seen anything like this before.  The girl who played Josie is awesome and believable!  The music rocked!  I'm ready for Darkwolf 2!,1047945600,8,226,4.868421052631579
1833729,1,B00008AOVO,"What else can I say? As a huge fan of werewolf movies, I was highly disappointed in the film. Horrible acting, lack of story and 1980s Mac computer level special effects, all combined make one waste of time.

As for the DVD itself: the picture and sound are fine, the special features acceptable and the disc played fine.  It also makes a great coaster for your beer.",1421971200,,367,4.462686567164179

1833731,5,B00008AOVO,"VERY, VERY, VERY sexy women being chased(certainly not chaste!) in this movie by a werewolf in New York City. This werewolf is played by Kane Hodder who played Jason Voorhees on Friday the 13th. A young woman is having strange urges every full moon and is befriended by a homeless woman who she gives food to in the alley behind the restaurant where she works as a waitress. The homeless woman turns out to be far more than she appears. Josie, the waitress, a gorgeous blond girl, finds out that she and the werewolf are not that much different. You guessed it, the two were meant to reproduce with each other. Multiple gruesome deaths occur including the homeless woman who turns out to be a ""Protector"" meaning someone who fights the werewolf menace. A cop befriends Josie and watches in horror as she steadily becomes a wolf herself(WITHOUT BEING BITTEN;she was born to party!) but always fights the transformations. After several deaths the showdown begins in a climax of gunfire and full moon madness! This movie features Hodder, Steven Williams(21 Jumpstreet from the 80's), and Jaime Bergman(various roles; David Boreanaz's, who played Angel and on Bones, wife), and some newcomers. This movie is VERY, VERY sexually charged with multiple sex scenes with a LOT of nudity. Very steamy scenes. If you like a mix of horror, gore, and soft porn, this is a good movie. However, the special effects/CGI were CLEARLY low budget.",1406851200,,1428,4.8806584362139915

1833737,2,B00008AOVO,"For entertainment value  I would give this movie a ""D minus"".  I watched the producers,  writer and actors comentaries and I would beg to differ with almost everything they said.  I bought this movie because it was inexpensive, recommended and purported to have world class nudity. I would agree that the girls featured were probably the most attractive thing about this project.  But,  the first time writer would be well advised to not put this effort on his resume..  for any of a number of reasons..  The acting was at least O.K. but,  nothing exemplary to brag about.... and,  again,  bad plot lines and dialogue are difficult to overcome.
I did not "" hate"" this film,  but,  I would not recommend it either.",1351900800,2,713,4.699186991869919
1833738,1,B00008AOVO,"In Los Angeles, police detectives covertly hunt down lycanthropes who threaten the safety of the unsuspecting public who believe werewolves are simply mythical creatures. Detective Steve Turley (played by actor Ryan Alosio) witnesses the death of his partner as a particularly dangerous beast known as Darkwolf (a sort of uber-wolfman) threatens the lives of him, a waitress who is stalked as a mating partner for the beast which needs to continue its hybrid lineage and the entire city.

This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and it is not even bad in a fun, laugh-at-it sort of way. Where do I even begin? How about the script? The plot is simple and silly. There is no tension or any memorable character(s). The characters say and do very stupid things, including the laugh-out-loud, nonsensical sentence fragment pouting of the lead actor, who acts like a police academy drop out. He also tells werewolf-related jokes, probably rejected jokes from Laffy Taffy wrappers, to which the other idiotic characters laugh at.

Then there is the acting, which is uniformly atrocious. Ryan Alosio is a very poor acting. Scream queen and Hitchcock favorite Tippi Hedren embarrasses herself with a small role in this film. People talk about the nudity and risque scenes involving women at a photoshoot. Technically, it is in the film but it is not even very memorable raciness or erotica, whether in a trashy or artistic fashion. You will also see some depressingly poor special effects as the ""Darkwolf"" looks like the lint gorilla from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Robin-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000B5XOXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman & Robin (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;on all-fours. I understand this is a direct-to-video film, but I am less lenient on the poor special effects and props since the budget was over $2 million in 2003 USD. Speaking of props, there is a laughable scene where a SWAT officer is shown ""firing"" an assault rifle which is obviously a toy being shaken while cartoonish sound effects are being made.

This is a film to be avoided. The tagline is ""Half Man. Half Beast. Pure Evil,"" but it should be ""Half Man. Half Beast. Pure Crap.""

1833752,1,B00008AOVO,"Sometimes I wish that I wasn't such a big fan of werewolves. It would spare me from a lifetime of watching and collecting such an endless list of terrible movies. In the tradition of second rate werewolf movies, Darkwolf shines through as a gleaming example of a THIRD RATE MOVIE.

The story is confused and dragged out with meaningless padding scenes. The acting, wardrobe, and props would embarrass the local AV and drama classes from your local high school. The CGI effects are completely unfinished and embarrassing to watch. Clearly the effect budget ran out midway through production.

The only saving grace of this film is the non stop parade of naked women that constantly pop up in the film from the opening sequence in a nude bar to an rather hot, 10 minute, totally useless to the plot photo session scene with two naked ladies in werewolf body paint having a near lesbo-erotic experience (Which is also the best acted scene in the whole movie).

If you are a werewolf enthusiast like me and collect media containing the hairy monsters no matter it's quality, then buy this one used. If you don't share my ""curse"", then I'm sure your money could be spent better elsewhere... like investing in Heath Ledger's newest film...",1265500800,,1233,4.779342723004695
1833753,3,B00008AOVO,"Hey..Kane Hodder starring as a werewolf! Sounds great, right? Not so much. This movie reminded me of some filthy after midnight flick you'd see on skinimax. The actresses were obviously hired for their willingness to disrobe, rather than their acting abilities. Some of the actors were okay, the black gentleman cop at the beginning was actually the best actor, and they killed him off within the first few minutes. Too bad. Kane Hodder is pretty menacing as he glares and stares, but when they unleash that mario paint transfomation, I just started lauphing. The few shots you see of the werewolf mask,or suit, or whatever, were not too bad, because it let you use your imagination. I don't mind a little nudity in my horror, It's expected, but to blantantley parade two teen girls around naked for what seemed like 10 minutes,on the rooftop made this movie just that much seedier.

1833756,3,B00008AOVO,"This movie was just as average movie but it could, if they put more money into it(it showed that little money was put into it), be a better movie.

The movie is a low budget movie(no surprise here) and the movie starts out at a strip club. that's a plus in my book, and breast flashing is happening within the frst few minutes. WOW! what a great way to take your mind off a mediocre movie.

Now, there some parts in the movie that can be scary but who...who will be scared of the werewolf? IT's a suit for crying out loud. Atl east tht's what it looked like. i was expecting to the see the zipper in the back.  SO, that obviously is not a plus, unless you seeing a fake werewolf in a horror movie. SCARY!!

Well, it is good to know that ""darkwolf"" makes fun of its self, which wouldn't have been hard to do anyway. There are many things that they do like: plastic guns(they thought you wouldn't notice in that scene),and CRAP ugly dialogue. Who wrote this? This really held the actors in this movie from breaking out.

The nudity is great but it is just trying for to forget how bad it is and see skin. Well, it didn't work.

Now on to the acting: Samaire Armstrong was great. This was her first major role and she did a great job ,dispite god-awful dialouge. So, i think yoo can expect alot of things out of her(STAY Alive, Just my luck , and It's a boy girl thing-all coming out in 2006). can you say future star?Kane hoddler really had an average performance but i can say one thing: he some pecs of steel. Not really much t o ay onthe acting besides that.

The audio is on'e of the movie's highlights. It got a little repititve but the music itself was great and plenty of it.

SO...... would i watch this movie again? likely not.  Even with the above average acting of samaire armstrong and hodder, the movie was jsut that:average and that's not good enough for me. So out of a ten i would give this a ..... 6/10 overall

  8/10music

  4/10money's worth

most of these actors you likely won't hear of again except samaire Armstrong. She has appeared on the oc etc. So, she's really the only main actress/actor that will(it seems) go on to do great things, just by seeing this. Just pick some better rolesnextime(which she did-look above on acting part of review).

must tell you that no matter a full moon, half moon,

quarter moon, or no moon at all, please avoid the

flick ""Darkwolf"" for many moons to come.  What a joke.

 What a silly, stupid, insult to one's intelligence.

The script could have been written by my dog

Stan...and even then, I give him the benefit of the

doubt to come up with something much more canine.

Let's put it this way.  Have you ever seen a film that

contained people that irritated you so much, you

simply didn't give a ^&^%* if they got blown away?  I

was hoping the entire cast got mulched by Mr. Wolf

less that 30 minutes into this loser.  Go ""Darkwolf"".

Take a few chucks out of this cast, its director,

producer, writer and editors as quickly as

possible...and don't wait until the next full moon.

""Darkwolf"" is an insult to motion pictures.  More so,

it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as

""The Wolf Man"", ""Wolfen"" and ""The Howling"", not to

mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic ""An

American Werewolf in London"".

Need I say more?  ""Darkwolf"" has no bite.  It's claws

and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion.  The box

claims this flick to be ""Half Man.  Half Wolf. Pure

Evil.""  In reality it is Half/Whole Stupid. Half/Whole

Worthless.  ...and...Pure ^%&*!

Get my drift?  At midnight...as we turn another page

and the new year unfolds...I promise you you will

enjoy reruns of every episode of ""Mary Hartman, Mary

Hartman"", much more than ""Darkwolf"".

I'm off to watch yet another New Year's flick before

dawn.  I need to make amends to Lon Chaney, Jr. before

midnight.

If I were stranded on a deserted island, I would take a gameboy, a DVD player, a copy of ""War and Peace""  and Darkwolf!  Hopefully by the time my boat get's shipwrecked, Darkwolf 2 will be in my posession!",1084320000,3,759,4.265734265734266
1833774,1,B00008AOVO,"Bad acting , low-budget (and I mean low!)special effects,and a plot that seems to be just an excuse to film nude scenes. The characters are uninteresting and one dimensional. If you feel that you have to subject yourself to this kind of torture I recommend you rent it first and save a few bucks. Better yet, buy Bad Moon with Michael Pare' (of Eddie and the Cruisers fame)and Mariel Hemingway if you want to see a GOOD werewolf movie, because Darkwolf is a dog!",1083801600,4,462,4.511904761904762
1833775,5,B00008AOVO,"This film is really hip.  I bought it last night and ended up watching it a few times.  The lead actress is from the tv series, ""The OC"" and she is really good, both in Darkwolf and on TV. Her name is Samaire Armstrong. There's alot to like about this movie if you're into B movies like I am. Don't take anything too seriously and I bet you end up really enjoying yourself.",1078444800,5,373,4.095890410958904
1833786,2,B00008AOVO,"Ryan Alioso, Samaire Armstrong and Tippi Hedren are the only reason I gave this ridiculously lurid and gory movie two stars.  The three actors defy all logic by being so good with given so little.  As for the dancing babes on the rooftop, why is it that lesbianism is now such a dominant element in so many horror movies.  It served no purpose in the film and the switch backs with this ridiculous scene and the murder of one of their friends was so long, I felt like I was in prison with an incommutable sentence.  Face it, people.  ...",1073952000,3,537,4.33
1833787,5,B00008AOVO,"I began watching this movie thinking to myself ""man this is pure garbage"" but somewhere along the line I became a fan.
I began typing an Amazon review in ""real time"", criticizing every scene on how dumb it was. I guess 45 minutes into it I could no longer type anything bad about it and was drawn in to this cheesy ""B"" flick. It was clear that the budget was minimal (oh boy was it clear), but they made this movie work with lots of bewbies and great acting.
The werewolves in this movie are a sad, pitiful site in they're mechanical, outfitted and CGI states but there's more to this movie than the mindless violence and the appearances of werewolves.",1073952000,10,652,4.396694214876033

This is one of the better B movies I've seen, I recommend it highly. I wish all the B horror films I buy were as good as this one. The scene on the rooftop is worth the price of the movie all by itself. Check it out.",1067212800,6,350,3.943661971830986
1833789,3,B00008AOVO,"This movie has an interesting premise.  900 years ago, a Saxon mated with a werewolf and started a race of hybrids.  Our story involves some policemen who understand this and have been hunting the hybrids.  But in this movie they run into something different.  They meet the Darkwolf, a hybrid that is far faster and stronger than any other.
The Darkwolf is a Dark Prince and he is looking for his special mate.  Should he find her and mate with her, their offspring will be unstoppable and mean the end of mankind.  Now it is up to one cop to protect the woman and stop the Darkwolf.
Some parts of this movie are similar to Mark Rogers's Runestone while others look like they were taken from Surrender Cinema.  There are some great scenes and some artistic scenes, but the movie lacks solid continuity.  A good example would be Dog Soldiers.
Also, the makers of the film should watch a few police shows.  The police in this movie were a real joke.  After one murder, some spectators just walk up and remove evidence in the middle of the investigation.  In fact the police completely ignore the witnesses and spectators.  The ending is also typical of action movies.  I am sure the IG office and Internal Affairs will be tired up with paperwork for years based on the ending, but the lead cop just walks away as if nothing really happened (watch the movie and you will see what I mean).
As many reviewers have pointed out, yes, there is a lot of nudity in this film.  First in a topless bar in the beginning and then during a moonlit photo shoot.  If that is what you are looking for, then this movie has it.",1065484800,,1608,4.440273037542662
1833790,2,B00008AOVO,"Tagline : Under a full moon, true terror begins.

Synopsis : A new breed of horror roams the streets of Los Angeles. It's the Darkwolf, a vicious werewolf with a thirst for blood ~ and a lust for Josie, a sexy, unsuspecting woman with a mysterious power she in only beginning to understand. once the Darkwolf catches Josie's scent, nothing can stop his insatiable hunger to mate with her....and he'll kill anyone who gets in the way!!

Overview : This movie did have some potential but it was lost somewhere along the way. The movie did move smoothly from beginning to end and the story was decent, but the acting suffered and the special effects weren't very special at all. The transformation scenes from human to wolf made me feel I just jumped into an XBOX game as I looked around for my controller. I did enjoy the few scenes were we SEE the wolf and the leftovers it strew behind him but that alone wasn't strong enough to hold this movie together.

Jekyll's Rating : Some people are fans when it comes to the direct to video movies...I suppose I am not one of them. This one gets a 2 star rating from me....get it as cheap as possible if you must.

1833791,1,B00008AOVO,"This movie had the potential to be an ok straight to video feature.  However, I must comment on the poor use of the computer graphics during the transformation scenes.  I thought I was watching a poor television ad.  It surprises me that they allowed these scenes to tarnish the whole film.  Where was the editor?  The acting on the other hand needed a lot of improvement, and what I don't like with horror movies these days is that everyone is trying to be smart during scenes which should be either scary or life threatening to the character at that point.  The little smart one liners don't work in every situation.
I must commend the team for at least trying to do some good in making a contribution to the werewolf genre and we know making such a feature with a limited budget is Hard Work, but please, if you can't use good CGI, leave it alone.
My favorite scenes were the van escape and oh yes, the roof top photo shoot.",1054512000,3,927,4.391812865497076
1833792,4,B00008AOVO,"Let me sum it up. I liked the movie. It had action, violence, suspense, drama... I cared about the characters. I also think the story has the potential to be a television series, perhaps on HBO so it could keep certain elements like the nudity (girl on girl action for those of you drooling for that) and the violence. The actual dialogue...well, it was alright. Nothing spectacular but this movie is definitely among the better ""b"" rated horror flicks. HOWEVER, I personally wouldn't spend the 31 dollars to buy it. Just rent it first to see if its worth being a part of your collection.",1054425600,7,588,4.609523809523809

1833794,5,B00008AOVO,"This is a just a good movie.  My friend and I rented it this weekend, and we were really glad we did.  I just love a good old fashioned horror film and rent at least one every weekend.  We sat back and watched great looking babes fight a terrifying wolf.  The story completely held my interest and we even had to rewind a few times to catch a few great scenes again.  This is better than the typical B-Movie stuff and definitely worth owning if you collect these kind of movies.  By the way, does anybody recognize Sasha Armstrong from the Power Rangers?  She was the yellow one, except here she's not wearing anything.
Darkwolf is a lot better than some of the horror junk that's in the theaters now.  It's a cool movie and I recommend it highly.",1051488000,5,747,4.323741007194244
