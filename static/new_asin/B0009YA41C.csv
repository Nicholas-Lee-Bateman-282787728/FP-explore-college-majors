2338493,5,B0009YA41C,"I happened to get tickets for the special screening of Academy Award nominated animated shorts in February this year.  When ""Ryan"" got the Oscar the next month it was no surprise- the film, about the animator Ryan Larkin, was so far beyond the other entrants there was kind of a collective gasp and a stunned silence followed by wild applause in the theater when it was shown.

Ryan Larkin did some remarkable breakthrough animation in the 60's and early 70's and Chris Landreth (The DVD also has early Larkin and Landreth films on it as well)animated an interview that he did with him thirty years later.  The concept and designs are visually stunning, pushing computer graphics to the edge of what is possible right now (Landreth is an engineer who went to work for Alias software as a creative consultant)and the depth of psychological truth illustrated with those techniques lift this to the status of pure art.

It will take your breath away.",1122249600,15,947,4.791411042944786
8070310,5,B0009YA41C,Ryan is an amazing film & well worth every penny.  The extras on the DVD really make it.  Chris Landreth's work really resonates.  This gently used copy arrived in perfect condition in a timely fashion. very happy. would buy from this vendor again.,1395532800,,248,4.72093023255814
8070311,5,B0009YA41C,"Ryan is the best conceived and realized piece of cinema I've seen in several years. Built around a videotaped documentary conversation between two artists, it uses 3D modeling software to fragment the images, add tertiary levels of comment, and perform deformations of perspective that are entirely integral to the narrative. Everyone interested in contemporary cinema should study this work (not just watch it once).",1227744000,2,417,5.53125
8070312,4,B0009YA41C,"If you are a fan of animation or documentaries, this video is for you.  Ryan's story is endearing, sad and fascinating - he is so strange and quirky, and its clear there is still something deep and worthwhile in what seems to be a ""shell"" of the man.

Beyond that, the animation is incredible - truly a talented artist at work here.  I would love to see more.",1206921600,2,359,4.25
8070313,5,B0009YA41C,"I recently watched ""Ryan"" just before watching Julien Temple's film on Joe Strummer, ""The Future is Unwriteen,"" and it's a perfect pairing in a lot of ways, not least in how each film stretches the genre unexpectedly and successfully into metaville, where the documentary is of the filmmaker as much as it is about the subject (think Michael Moore, but without the noxious grandstanding).

But this is about ""Ryan."" Despite what I said comparing this with the Joe Strummer documentary, there is really nothing like ""Ryan."" Chris Landreth combines CGI cartoon images with hyperrealistic caricature and self-reflective and -conscious psychologizing with a genuine sympathy for the person that Ryan Larkin has become. It works on all these levels, and all in 15 minutes.

Don't miss the ""making-of"" documentary that is in the special features or Landreth's two other short computer animations. I don't know where he might be going with this style, but in ""Ryan"" he did something unique. If you're a fan of CGI or serious animation in general, check it out.",1198281600,2,1053,5.08092485549133
8070314,4,B0009YA41C,"Ryan (Chris Landreth, 2004)

Ryan is an animated short--Chris Landreth, a contemporary artist, interviewing and mulling over Ryan Larkin, a retired artist from the sixties. It's about thirteen minutes long, it's quite good, it won an Oscar, and you should see it. But the reason you should own the special-edition DVD is the longer, non-animated documentary Alter Egos, which is about the making of Ryan, the art of both Larkin and Landreth, and the personalities of the two. It's fascinating to watch the interaction between them. It's as good as the short. This one's a keeper. *** ",1180137600,2,584,5.010309278350515
8070315,5,B0009YA41C,With the recent passing(Feb. 14) of Ryan Larkin it is a good time to re-examine the work of an animation genius. This short film is very good and insightful and I think it is done respectfully and without exploiting its subject. The brilliant work that Larkin did do in his life makes this short film a celebration of his genius and his lasting legacy. The three films of Larkin's are a true revelation and are done with such technical skill and such a child-like love of life that it is hard not to be moved by them. They are truly beautiful works of art and Larkin's reputation as one of the greats is secure.,1176508800,,611,4.368421052631579
8070316,5,B0009YA41C,"I fell into this film quite by accident.  How fortunate for me.  Oh that I had a fraction of the insight, talent and brilliance Landreth has shown here.  Buy it, watch it, think about it and then watch it again.  You will be amazed at the art and animation, and you'll be equally moved by the novel ways in which Landreth depicts the scars of the human journey.",1138147200,4,361,4.264705882352941
8070317,5,B0009YA41C,"This film immediately grabs your attention right from the begining, and not simply because it is animated. It really comes from the fact that its use of colour and imagery is utter perfection. The film talks about the life and works of the amazing Canadian animator Ryan Larkin and his works from the 70's, and the woman he loved.

The aspects that make this stand apart from other animated shorts is the way Chris Landreth chose to evoke thought and emotion. The people you see are only partly complete, perhaps in reference that we can only ever know people so much and that the rest of them is a mystery. When their emotions become stronger their bodies will spike colours or contort into strange shapes.

This film will mesmerize you and awaken your imagination with form, colour, and beauty. If you love film and animation, this is something you must not miss.",1138147200,3,865,4.684210526315789
8070318,5,B0009YA41C,"Sometimes we meet people on the fringe, people who do not subscribe to society's dominant rituals, people who may be addicted to any number of illegal stimuli, but in the face of more pervasive delusions find themselves consistently sober and lucid.  They are often artists, or recluses, or both.  Sometimes we admire them.  Sometimes we are inspired by them.  Sometimes they give us a sense of liberation, promise and hope.  Sometimes they send us warning of places we shouldn't go.

Chris Landreth has made a remarkable film about himself and Ryan Larkin, about two vibrant souls in various stages of burning.  It's about the process of animating life, about creating art and about living on the cusp of madness and reality.  It's a truly remarkable film, completely deserving of its Academy Award.

The film alone would be worth the price of admission, but the documentary, Alter Egos, is included, and it is equally brilliant.  In it, you'll learn more about Ryan, more about the history of the National Film Board of Canada and more about the genius of two men at the center of this work.  Also included are additional short films from both artists, as well as commentary tracks.  It's a great package, and hopefully it will inspire you to seek out more of the work of the NFB.",1136160000,15,1282,4.777272727272727
8070319,5,B0009YA41C,"I stumbled upon 'Alter Egos', Lawrence Green's documentary about Landreth and Larkin and the making of 'Ryan', on the Independent Film Channel a few weeks ago.  Prior to that I was completely unfamiliar with both of these men.

Each of them has his own distinct animation style and yet you can see the profound influence Larkin's work had on Landreth.  But the most affecting aspect of both 'Alter Egos' and 'Ryan' is the personal effect Larkin has had (and continues to have, it seems) on Landreth's psyche!  There's a very strong sense of 'There, but for the grace of God, go I' in Landreth's attitude toward Larkin and it's quite potent.

At a mere 13 minutes long, 'Ryan' is a truly fascinating piece.  Judging on visual style alone, this film earns its 5-star rating.  Add to that a rather brilliant concept and truly affecting content, and you have what most would consider a perfect film.

In addition to 'Ryan', the DVD contains 'Alter Egos', Green's absorbing and informative documentary, as well as 3 Larkin pieces, all of which are quite wonderful.  While watching them, the heart slowly breaks to think of what's become of such a talented man.  It also contains two other really interesting Landreth pieces:  'the end' and 'Bingo'.  Landreth is one of the very few CGI animators who have managed to break through the sterility of computer animation and come up with work that's truly artistic and emotionally affecting.  (WARNING:  Those of you with an inherent fear of clowns might want to have some smelling salts at hand while watching 'Bingo'.)  All of the pieces on the DVD have directors' commentary tracks available and Larkin's commentaries on his pieces, in particular, are quite fascinating.

All in all, this is an incredibly rich package!  Getting all of this material for the cost of a single DVD borders on petty thievery.  For anyone with more than a glancing interest in animation, this is one of those 'definitely must haves'.",1133827200,6,1955,4.872727272727273
