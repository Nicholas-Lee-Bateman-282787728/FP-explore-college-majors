837446,5,6304288581,"We absolutely adored this charming animated version of Wind in the Willows. The characters truly represent those one might imagine from the classic tale.

Ratty (Michael Palin) and Mole (Alan Bateman), among others, inhabit the book, as it were, as well as all the river bank environs and of course Toad Hall.

Delightful, all the way around, even if you have no kids, or in that case, more likely if your nest has gone empty. A beautiful way to relax.",1374105600,2,452,4.6375
837447,5,6304288581,"This is a well told, simply beautiful, version of The Wind in the Willows. Children of all ages (toddlers to older adults) will love it. The music is very soothing making it the perfect bedtime story. I played this for my daughter when she was young and find that I still love to fall to sleep to it in September, when the air has a hint of crispness as Summer turns to Fall. I have purchased it three times, already. I've never found it on DVD.",1286150400,4,445,4.186046511627907
837448,4,6304288581,"While no adaptation can be perfect this one comes near.  While much of the book had to be cut in order to make this a viewable length, and there were a few liberties taken, this film was a delightful version of the story.  I highly recommend it.",1118966400,,245,4.191489361702128
837449,5,6304288581,"If you've never followed the adventures of a rat, a mole, a badger, or a toad ... well, here is your chance.

This animated movie (that has an un-animated beginning and end) is a delightful mixture of fun, friendship, adventure, and irreverence.  The irreverence is provided courtesy of Mr. Toad.

The animation here is excellent, and a good deal of imagination was used in writing the story ... all very much fun ... which follows the lives of the animals living along or near ""the river"".

This movie is an adaptation of a book, of the same title, that was first published in 1908.  Kenneth Grahame is the author, and a wonderful man he must have been.  The movie makers do an excellent job of picking and choosing (from the book) what to use ... and a slight re-arranging and modifying of dialog and circumstances ... is again ... high quality work of the very competent movie makers.

The actors who provide the voices for the animals do a superb job of bringing these creatures to life.  I think we tend to take these good characterizations for granted, but these fellows here are truly outstanding at giving these animals unique and believable personalities.

My favorite character is the rat (""Rattie"") but one cannot help but love Mr. Toad.

But this is a fun movie from beginning to end.",1105574400,,1296,4.644736842105263
837450,2,6304288581,"If the people of Goodtimes Video Distribution didn't destroy this awesomely animated series with their ghastly editing, this version of Wind of the Willows easily earns 5 stars.  A lot of the original British production has been shabbily cut to make 3 ""complete cartoons.""  Inexplicably two of these mangled vignettes actually repeat Toad's car stealing & escape.  There is no reason for this bungling.  It would have been so much easier just to package & distribute the John Coates/Dave Unwin series in it's original format.  This beautiful animated version of Wind of the Willows deserves a better distributor.  For shame, Goodtimes!",1094515200,10,635,5.237623762376238
837451,4,6304288581,"I watched this as an adult, so I can't speak for how kids will encounter it.  Thoughts:

- One thing that distracted me during the movie was the pacing of the plot.  It's impressive that they crammed the book into 90 or so minutes, but as a result some parts seem hurried.  Maybe that keeps kids' interest better.

- One thing the cartoon did well was giving the animal characters stereotypical mannerisms of post-Victorian British gentry (bachelors, to be specific).  These aren't ""National Geographic"" animals--these are British ""good old boys"".  That adds to the charm & makes the characterizations really come alive.  That's why this story will be considered a classic for a long time.

- Finally, Toad is so over the top (wacky) that it's almost hard to take sometimes.  How long do we have to see him despairing in his prison cell for his daft & reckless behavior?  There are definite similarities of tone with, say, Wodehouse's ""Wooster & Jeeves"" in these parts, but wackier, if that can be believed.",1093824000,4,1007,4.796511627906977
837452,5,6304288581,"This is an enchanting cartoon film for al ages.  ""The Wind and the Willows "" series is a classic.  Toad , mole, and all the gang are a sweet and cudly family for children and adults to watch as well.",1045699200,3,199,3.95
837453,4,6304288581,"I enjoyed both the art and the voices.  I think what I really enjoyed most was the ""feel"" of this video.  Some wonderful visual sequences of the sun on the river. More like art and less like a cartoon--although this  is animation, not a series of stills as in some other story-videos.  Still,  it's not the frenzied pace of most cartoons these days.  And unlike a lot  of animated videos--even ones of this story--it doesn't talk down to kids.  I especially liked Michael Palin as the rat.  He did a terrific job with  the Rabbit Ears Video of ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" and I wish  he'd do more.",951868800,11,595,4.416666666666667

7867471,5,6304288581,"Kenneth Grahame author of wind in the willows told a great story and the movie actually followed the book pretty closely, I enjoyed watching Ratty, Moley, and Frog what a great imagination.",1418083200,2,189,4.9375
7867472,5,6304288581,"I remember watching this as a little girl, and absolutely falling in love with Ratty, Moley, Otter, Badger, and all the rest (well, excepting Mr. Toad, that is)! Mum must have rented it from the library, however, because I never saw it again until I just recently purchased it from Amazon. Much to my delight, it's charming quaintness and loveable characters had not changed over all these years (though the little girl most certainly has). This film is a treasured addition to any English Literature lover's collection! I would also add, that it has a lovely sequel - The Willows in Winter.",1402012800,,591,4.803921568627451
