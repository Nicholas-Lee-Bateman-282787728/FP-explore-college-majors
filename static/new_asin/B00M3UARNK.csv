8670112,5,B00M3UARNK,"I've always loved this movie, finally out on Blu Ray. This is a good transfer from the film, but not a restoration... noticeable film grain especially in the darker scenes, indicative of the state of the art for film of it's time, but not very objectionable, and a huge improvement over the DVD version.",1417910400,5,303,4.62962962962963
