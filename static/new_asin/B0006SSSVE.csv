8042968,3,B0006SSSVE,"Boot Hill Bandits, 1942 film

This features the Range Busters: Ray Crash Corrigan, John Dusty King, and Max Alibi Terhun. [Was this team inspired by The Three Musketeers novel from the 19th century?] A man rides into town and enters a tavern. He has seven notches on his pistol, and is handy in its use! Another man enters and talks to the first man, who was arrested and convicted in the past. They make a shooting date for 4 pm. Who is that stranger? He orders milk! Bolton meets the Kid as he rides back to town. Corrigan visits the Sheriffs office, tells him about the Mesquite Kid, and explains his actions. Men stand outside just before 4 pm. The stage coach arrives in town. Corrigan meets Miss Meadows. Corrigan drinks his mil with added sugar.

The Mesquite Kid arrives with a friend at the tavern, shots are fired. The Mesquite Kid steps out the door, lights his cigarette, then falls down! Corrigan steps out carrying the other man. He has shown his qualifications for Marshal of Sundance. Crash and friends will look for a wagon that carries a valuable cargo. Crash sees a runaway wagon without a driver and rides after it. Theres an explosion in that wagon! The Sheriff and his men ride there. Bolton is back in town. A man reads the epitaphs on Boot Hill. Maverick meets Bolton in secret and trades the Marshals badge for gold dust. Maverick meets Joe for a very short conversation. Then Crash appears, Maverick thinks he is a ghost and backs up too far! Crash mounts up and rides to town, Dusty and Alibi meet him and escort him to jail.

Only a few people knew about the shipment. Crash will stay dead to continue his investigation. Miss Meadows gives that badge to the Sheriff. The Chief visits Bolton and orders a meeting for tomorrow, and, to hide that badge. A stranger asks Miss Meadows for that Marshals badge, she doesnt have it. Bolton fires at Dusty, but misses! Dusty rides after him and stops him. There is a fist fight, Dusty wins. Alibi and Elmer outwit a villain, then release Miss Meadows. Bolton denies knowing about that badge, but is offered a deal. The Mayor reveals his treachery, the rest of the gang are caught. Sundance is cleaned up. The Range Busters ride away to their next adventure.

The sound and picture quality are very good, unlike some others in this 50 Movie Pack. Scenes were removed to cut the running time to an hour (implied by the absence of what was later referenced). The story has the usual themes: a dangerous bad guy who needs to be eliminated, a gang leader who is cahoots with a hidden powerful man, gold shipments that are stolen due to inside information. The outdoor scenery reminds me of some other movies in this collection.",1506816000,,2691,4.576763485477178
8042969,5,B0006SSSVE,"...At least according to me, and if you're wondering if it's possible for The Range Busters to actually have a ""BEST"" film, then this is most definately the one I would nominate. The dialogue is quite good, playing up the Western genre with stylized, snappy one-liners, sort of reminding me of Spaghetti Westerns, only 20+ years ahead of it's time, especially in the early scenes that have Crash Corrigan meeting with and exchanging machisimo shooting skills with I. Stanford Jolly, who, himself, looks as though he just rode in off a Cinecitta sound stage.

The film itself is usual Range Busters fare, rounding up the bad guys while Crash and Dusty compete for the fair maid. Yet this one rises above the usual with good performances from George Chesebro, who starts off as kind of a good guy for once, which threw me off track briefly, but reverts back into his comfortable self becoming the chief foil for puppet Elmer Sneezeweed's barbed banter. And this is one of the episodes where Elmer, left on his own, actually moves by himself as though alive,...kindda creepy.

And speaking of creepy, Glenn Strange reprises his Monsterous Halfwit Idiot character from PRC's George Zucco horror film of the same year, THE MAD MONSTER. John Merton and Steve Clark also appear doing what they do best, boss heavy and elderly sheriff respectively. Jean Brooks has little to do as the female lead, but does it well enough.

The ALPHA DVD source print I found quite acceptible, clear with good audio, especially for my deaf ears. So many Range Busters dvds are so dark and choppy with bad audio, but not this one. I actually enjoyed the scenery of Crash Corrigan's ranch for once! So rest assured, this is a good one to pick up if you're a fan of such stuff. I really liked it a lot and consider it to be my favorite Range Busters movie...maybe.",1319760000,,1836,4.695652173913044

The majority of MONOGRAM's two dozen Range Busters programmers were filmed at 'Crash' Corrigan's ranch. As with others of these western trio series, the Busters cast underwent changes over time, especially, in this case, because of WWII. One thing that was fairly constant: a primitive wooden dummy received billing.

In their 14th installment, BOOT HILL BANDITS, a wagon carrying mine payroll is exploded and Marshal Corrigan supposedly killed. A gang member find's Crash's badge and gives it to the boss, who hands it over to the sheriff, which exposes him as leader. As usual, Terhune does some comic relief ventriloquism with Elmer. A sub-par Range Busters programmer.

8042971,4,B0006SSSVE,"Monogram Pictures presents ""BOOT HILL BANDITS"" (24 April 1942) (56 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- With the success of Republic's Three Mesquiteers, several forces came together around 1940 to develop a new 'trigger trio' for the screen --- The star was Ray 'Crash' Corrigan, a producer named George W. Weeks and Monogram Pictures --- With a character of his own name. Ray starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series between 1940 and 1943 --- The Range Busters was clearly a lower budget copy of the Mesquiteers --- Big, muscular Ray 'Crash' Corrigan was the lead, the second lead was John 'Dusty' King, a big band singer (Ben Bernie Orchestra) with a reasonably good baritone, who would vocalize a tune or two in each film --- And comic relief was in the hands of ventriloquist Max 'Alibi' Terhune (and his wise-cracking dummy Elmer --- Monogram would distribute the Range Busters but not be directly involved in the productions --- The deal gave Corrigan a substantial share of the film profits (in an interview years later, Ray said he received 50%).

Roy S. Luby  - Director
George W. Weeks  - Producer
Arthur G. Durlam  - Screenwriter

Our story line and plot, Our heroes Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan (Himself), Dusty (John King) and Alibi (Max Terhune) members of the Range Busters have their hands full with Brand Bolton (John Merton) who has his men blow up a wagon carrying the mine payroll and Marshal Crash Corrigan --- He supposedly killed in the explosion as a man finds his badge and gives it to Bolton --- Thinking Crash dead, Bolton gives the badge away and it ends up with the Sheriff --- Turns out Crash is fine and the Range Busters know Bolton is the head of the gang but that he gets his orders from someone else and that is the man they want --- Could it be our honest Mayor Noah Smyth (Budd Buster) is underhanded and dealing from the bottom of the deck --- Seems veteran character actor Glenn Strange is playing the good guy this time and has the evidence to go after all the badmen in this Monogram oater.

8042972,2,B0006SSSVE,"Specifically regarding the Alpha DVD. The source print was a worn 16mm dupe which is soft and has some missing frames plus a few audio dropouts. It certainly is viewable but better on a small television than a large High Def screen. The soundtrack is adequate with minor distortion. Overall, slightly above average for Alpha.

The film's storyline is pedestrian as is Ray Corrigan. This is standard, low-budget westen fare made during the height of World War II. Obviously, not everyone was rushing off to war, as the Range Busters series was cranked out throughout WW2.

Although this is available on Amazon for less than $3.50 with shipping, it is not worth the price. If you can find it a yard sale or swap meet for a dollar, then buy it.",1172966400,2,741,4.648854961832061
