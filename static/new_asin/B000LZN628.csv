Excellent dance instructional DVD. After the first half of lesson 1, they quickly progress to what I would define as intermediate level two-step.  After lesson 3, I would consider lessons 4,5, and 6 advanced patterns.
Some patterns covered:
Basic Promenade.
Sweetheart.
Skaters patterns
In and outs.
Wraps.
Outside turn.
Leader right hand, to followers left hand turns.
Right to right turns.
Double turns.
Bow-tie.
Free spins.
Belt loops.
Pivots.
Checks.
Checks with reverse turns.",1389484800,2,511,5.308641975308642
8165418,5,B000LZN628,I have been taking private and group dance lessons and the level of detail that Grant Austin goes over is comparable and in some cases better. I actually learned things that had been overlooked in my private dance lessons. I also own the Shawn Trautman Two Step Collection and the presentation and level of detail of the Grant Austin DVDs is far superior. I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to learn or improve in country two step. It is like having your own private dance lessons. Grant covers in very great detail moves and footwork for both the lead and follower. I plan on getting the other DVD collections put out by Grant. Thank you Grant you're awesome!,1259107200,,676,4.641666666666667
