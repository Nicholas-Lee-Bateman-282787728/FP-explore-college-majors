8440679,5,B004TGYHLY,"First, I am so grateful that this recording was made.  I have not found any other teacher lecturing in such depth and detail on this subject.  Dr. Fratkin explains why leaky gut is a modern disorder and therefore not fully addressed by the Chinese classics.  He then instructs how to use lab tests to assess an individual patient's case and, on that basis of the results, create a custom treatment protocol using Chinese herbs, Western herbs and supplements, and (if needed) recommendations for allopathic prescriptions.  Dr. Fratkin has apparently been developing this approach to leaky gut combining Chinese medicine and functional medicine for many years.  His expertise shows, as the information is thorough and very clearly laid out.  The accompanying handouts are excellent.

Second, the format is great.  You get a whole weekend's worth of lectures with no travel, no extra expenses for lodging, meals, etc.  You can watch at your own pace and go back and re-watch for those things you inevitably miss the first time around.  And if you don't need more CEU's for this recertification period, you can delay taking the quiz so that they can be counted toward the next recertification period.

Third, the vendor has provided great, personalized customer service.  I look forward to the upcoming release of more recorded lectures from this Maxwell Health Products, particularly Alex Tiberi's teachings.",1311984000,,1405,5.195555555555556
8440680,5,B004TGYHLY,"This is an excellent lecture.

Dr. Fratkin really knows medicine and is so generous with his information.  Great explanation of diseases of the gut from both the Western and Eastern views and how to integrate Chinese herbs with Western nutritional supplements. He teaches you how to order and read lab reports and how to pick the appropriate formulas and supplements.

The best part is that you can watch and learn at your own speed. I can hardly find time to attend CEU classes in person so I am very grateful Dr. Fratkin took the time to make this. I hope there's more to come!",1309305600,,579,4.548076923076923
