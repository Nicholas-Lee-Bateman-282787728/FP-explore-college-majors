8401235,3,B003NKU9EG,"The production consists of 5 unconnected stories in 103 minutes. The first feature is a ghost story about tortured and murdered girls. It contains the nudity and using the Roger Corman formula it goes first to hold our interest.

The second feature was a well done British production with metaphoric zombies. Workers are turned into mindless zombies, chained to their desk consuming coffee to get going. Every now and then they are thrown a temp to devour so they don't eat themselves. Ouch!

The third feature was a torture film as a man is allowed to torture the pedophile who abducted and killed his daughter.

The fourth feature was about a man searching for his wife's killer.

The fifth feature was black and white of a girl who was crazy and I don't know what. While she did the crazy thing quite well, I didn't see the point of the film.

There is also a video from the first feature. It too contains nudity...similar to a 1990 album cover by the Dwarves.

F-bombs, nudity. Minor zombie sex scene.",1405036800,2,1005,4.617977528089888
