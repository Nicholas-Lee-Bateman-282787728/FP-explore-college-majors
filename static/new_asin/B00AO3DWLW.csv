8738768,5,B00AO3DWLW,"I saw this film and loved the coming of age newness it brings to the 20's and 30 somethings who are ""figuring it out"" on a day to day. Very funny and full of quick wit and jabs.
Can't wait to buy it!!!!!!!",1364256000,,205,3.7906976744186047
8738769,5,B00AO3DWLW,"SEXUALLY FRANK is a fantastic little film that, as others have mentioned, feels akin to Kevin Smith's early films.  They share a focus on sexual humor, (obviously) and interpersonal conflicts, but it never feels crass or forced, unlike with some of the later Smith's recent movies.  The main difference between Frankie Frain and Kevin Smith, however, is that Frain has actual filmmaking chops. While SEXUALLY FRANK is a small film, it never feels claustrophobic or cheap.  It feels personal and intimate and real.  Definitely worth checking out!",1364256000,4,545,5.2298850574712645
8738770,5,B00AO3DWLW,"I saw a screening of Sexually Frank last year. It's funny and sweet, but I think the best part of it is the perspective it offers on sexuality and relationships. The film isn't preachy, and it doesn't try to force personal matters into the frame of ~universal human truth~ . It just depicts different people, in different relationships, feeling differently about the parameters of those relationships and acting based on their own choices. There's no bulls***.",1364256000,3,460,5.065789473684211
8738771,5,B00AO3DWLW,"Frankie Frain has a gift for comedy that rivals Kevin Smith, combining incredibly witty humor with an irrepressible resistance to any kind of boundary, social or otherwise.  I haven't laughed so hard at a film since Clerks 2.  I was lucky enough to get a copy of this from an independent distributor, and I was disappointed not to see it in stock on Amazon.  It's an AMAZING film and very much worth watching if you can find it.  Demand that Amazon track it down!",1364256000,4,463,4.476190476190476
