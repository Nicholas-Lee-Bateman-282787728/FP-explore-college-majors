With Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry,  Wodehouse seems to have been blessed with actors born to play these  unforgettable characters. In this episode, set in Totleigh Towers (which  Bertie calls ""the hell hole we know and love""), Bertie is in high  spirits because both Madeline Basset (who believes that the stars are God's  daisychain) and Lady Florence Craye (who's nickname in the servant's hall  is Lady Caligua) are safely engaged to be married. Other characters in this  episode are Sir Roderick Spode (the leader of a fascist group and previous  owner of a lingerie shop who is engaged to Madeline), Florence's  ""absolute idiot"" fiance Ginger Winship, Madeline's father Sir  Watkin Basset, Tuppy Glossop, and Brinkley, Bertie's evil ex-valet. An  interesting aspect of this episode is the up-coming bi-election in  Totleigh-in-the-Wold, in which both Winship and Spode, as conservatives,  battle the ""red"" candidate Comrade McCorkadale for a seat in  parliament.",967939200,,1080,5.383233532934132
