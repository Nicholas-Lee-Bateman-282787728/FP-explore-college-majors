559712,4,6303102484,"Leonard Maltin's review aside, this is a great period action film w/ romance.  One of the first Great Submarine movies. This transfer by FOX VIDEO is spectacular!  The transfer element is almost perfect considering  the age of the materials.  Colors are vibrant and look to be true to the  Technicolor original.  Cinematographer Leon Shamroy does a fabulous job.  All in all, a joy to watch and you can't help feel patriotic with Tyronne  Powers' speech at the end of the film....

560018,3,6303102484,"Crash Dive is presented as a submarine movie, but the sub story is more of a background to the screen romance, which feels as if it occupies about half the film. The exterior sub scenes were filmed with one of the two Mackerel-class ""mini-fleet-boats"", which were imposed on our submarine service but were too small for the Pacific war; they were assigned to the sub school at New London for officer training. The non-sub scenes occupy about half the screen-time. The story is a very fictional adventure, with a WWI style encounter with a German armed freighter posing as a neutral in the Atlantic, and an equally dubious story about these armed ships being fueled at an island-base, which Power and his volunteers must destroy.

Some of the sub clips in this 20th Century Fox production were re-used in the second half of 1943 for brief appearances at the beginning and end of Warner's Destination Tokyo. Crash Dive is not a realistic sub story like Destination Tokyo, but OK if you like amusing romance coupled with old-fashioned ""shoot-'em up/blow-'em up"" adventure stories.",1347667200,8,1077,4.917582417582418
560059,5,6303102484,"I have to admit I get goose bumps watching this film.  It depicts the best of times in our history --a time that inspired patriotism and pride in our country. TYRONE POWER as Lt. Stewart was everything his fans wanted him to be - handsome, funny, heroic, romantic. Anne Baxter and Dana Andrews were well cast in their roles. Dame May Whtty was a darling, and Harry Morgan was a young submariner in one of his first movie roles.
This movie won a well-deserved Oscar(1944) for Special Effects. Another interesting fact: at the time Ty Power was signed to play the role of a First Lieutenant in the Navy, in real life he had just enlisted as a Private in the Marines. Ty was already a very experienced pilot. He was to serve 3 years as a Marine pilot in the South Pacific flying the wounded out of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. At the time of his untimely death in 1958, he was a Major in the Marine Corps Reserves.",1327276800,4,904,4.317647058823529

Still, the two men have a common enemy despite their rivalry - those damned Nazis. They must head through northern Atlantic waters to destroy some Nazi storage tanks for fuel. The able James Gleason who always plays a great crusty chief works well in the cast.",1223337600,5,604,4.87378640776699
560066,5,6303102484,"I was born the year this movie was released, while the average American service man yet had 3 years or more left to serve. In fact, many American military men did not start returning home until 1946 or later, my father returned in '46, as well as my wife's father whose USMC service continued after the landings on Saipan and then on to China for more garrison duty.

This is a notable movie for a couple reasons: first, though by June, 1942, after the battle of Midway we were fairly certain the allies would prevail, with D-Day in the ETO still a year away. So when this movie was a wrap no one could be absolutely certain of the outcome of WWII, and as the final frames of the movie show War Bonds and stamps were still being sold in the local movie theaters.

Secondly, on the credits Tyrone Power is shown to be in the USNR and would soon go to active duty (USN). Though this is a patriotic picture of mild cheer leading, the script itself is well told and only at picture's end do we receive a ""well done"" U.S. Navy speech.

Another mark of the movie's excellence is the rich color used in filming, at that time in WWII though some actual war footage was shot in color, the color process & film was still very expensive.  So we have not only a well done film but one that was not low budget at all.

And though I am now in my late 60s, the years I spent with the USN/USMC on active duty never fail to give me a certain pride when viewing this movie. Call it what you will, it never fails to offer me a good feeling of active duty service.

Other reviews mention the manner in which the Germans are depicted, and I agree that Hollywood at this time did not have a realistic fix on the Nazi war machine, with both the German uniforms and speech leaving much to be desired as to reality.

The film may have a few flaws, but very few, and for war entertainment captures the 1940 era very well, especially evidenced by that keen convertible Tyrone Power zips around in.

All in all, a good, sound WWII yarn and one that allows wonderful footage of the WWII 'pig boat' submarines.  If you haven't seen this picture you might want to check it out. I cannot agree with any review that says the film will soon be forgotten. While it may not be an award winning picture, it certainly is one of the better films in the FOX War Classics library.

Semper Fi.",1218326400,6,2351,4.251121076233184
560067,4,6303102484,"This is a Tyrone Power movie, everything and everyone else is background.  There is nothing wrong with this since Tyrone Power is an excellent actor, as good as his press releases would have you believe, and he was attractive to say the least.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of Dana Andrews, who I personally consider a weak actor.  Anne Baxter, on the other hand, is Power's match in the acting arena (All About Eve, The Razor's Edge).  She is not given the opportunity here with predictable lines and an unbelieveable wardrobe she manages to pack in a couple of suitcases for several days, as well as leaving her charges on their own until early morning while she dances and drinks with Mr. Power (who could blame her) at an embassy gathering.  Although contrived, with Tyrone Power in the lead, you know it is contrived but you don't mind since he let's you know it is by the way he approaches the part.

On the military side, after all this is WWII, Ben Carter gives one of the more memorable performances as an AA aboard a submarine.  Not only is he given a lot of screen time for a cook, he is an important part of the ship and the last scene with him and Tyrone Power swimming to the submarine together.  They have to go underwater because of the oil on the surface and dialog is humorous and realistic.  (Tyrone Power to Carter:  ""Do you know how to swim underwater?""  Carter:  ""No, but I'm learning right now."")  James Gleason is good and it has the usual Ra! Ra! at the end.

I think, for me, the movie touched on all those aspects of WWII that were so important at the time and have relevance today:  Separation, relationships put on hold, events totally out of your control, death at any time, time at shore being jam packed because it doesn't last long and it may be your last time and the idea that the crew was a team.

Direction is excellent and Tyrone Power gives a master class at the end on patriotism masquerading as a speech about the Navy.  All in all, Dame Mae Whitty, an excellent actress and perfect in this (as usual), adds to the humor and the fun.

I recorded it as soon as I could off TV. Now, I'm glad it's on DVD.  Get your copy and watch it on a war movie night in your home, with plenty of wine (or beer) and lots of greasy popcorn.",1212451200,,2281,4.29976580796253

560123,5,6303102484,"Oliver Cromwell Jones, the black cook, is given a lot of screen time and the screen play treats him as an integral part of the mission.  He is played by Ben Carter, one of the actors profiled in Donald Bogle's recent book BRIGHT BOULEVARDS, BOLD DREAMS; he was the agent for black Los Angeles actors who got in trouble with his clients because he often took the best parts and played them himself!  This is definitely one of those cases, for he has a scene with James Gleason for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar, he's so good in the part--and it isn't one of Hollywood's wretched racially stereotypical parts, but one with real human feeling, dignity, comedy all mixed together.  Gleason is super too.

However the picture really belongs to its headlining trio of stars, and they all rise to the occasion.  Anne Baxter is not photographed very well.  One of the characters picks up her photograph and looks at it saying, ""She's so beautiful,"" but in truth she looks awful and her face is round as a beach ball.  But she's perky, soulful, repressed in turns.  I love the part where she teaching a squadron of schoolgirls how to shoot an arrow into a line of targets.  The girls are dressed in incredibly tight school uniforms (archery outfits I guess) and all move like robots or the dancers in a Robert Palmer video, all releasing their arrows at exactly the same time.  The odd thing is that they're supposed to be nervous and giggly about the sudden appearance of Tyrone Power, so all of them miss the target.  Baxter is just terrible playing the part--did she ever get good, no not really, but they wrote better parts for her later on.  However except for her face she looks wonderful and the designers have some great 40s clothes for her, including several pairs of red gloves which they must have thought would be a big trendsetter in 1943.  Dana Andrews is very trim and not as creepy as usual.  Acting (and good looks) honors belong to Tyrone Power, who has one of those scenes where his dotty grandma (Dame May Whitty) opens up a childhood scrapbook and points out to his girl (Baxter) a photo of her grandson as a baby boy, naked, bare ass hanging in the air.  He's all embarrassed and slams the book down on Grandma's hands.  They have a funny relationship.  She calls him ""Stinky,"" and he greets her fondly as ""Butch.""  Dame May Whitty could play a hard, cold aristocrat; but here she's the loveable kind, sort of like Marie Dressler used to play.

The Technicolor transfer on the DVD is superb.  I wonder when people went to the movies in the 1940s if they zeroed in on Technicolor pictures and felt disappointed when a movie was in black and white.  The blues, reds, and purples of CRASH DIVE are so rich and lustrous you feel as though it had been melted down from velvet.",1120780800,9,2803,4.521825396825397
560124,3,6303102484,"""Crash Dive,"" a melodramatic lover's triangle between naval heroes (Tyrone Power and Dana Andrews) and the girl they both love (Anne Baxter), is one of those standard war flicks made at the height of conflict (1943). Remarkably, it continues to stir up patriotism and lift the spirits, despite a somewhat heavy handed script and some truncated bits of romance that seem to be inserts into an otherwise straight forward and compelling adventure movie. Powers is a reluctant executive officer aboard a submarine. His relationship with his new captain (Andrews) becomes strained after he realizes that they are in love with the same woman. All this is background fodder for the real plot of the movie - a mid-Atlantic ambush of a secret German island and its Nazi military base.
THE TRANSFER: Filmed on location, Leon Shamroy's lush Technicolor photography is the real star of ""Crash Dive"" and although the film has dated considerably, there's still enough gleam in the original negative to compel the viewer onward. Colors are rich and for the most part, nicely balanced. Occasionally there are scenes in which the color scheme becomes unstable or flickers. There is also an abundance of age related artifacts that detract from the overall visual presentation. Black and contrast levels are generally solid.  There's a slight haze over some of the scenes as well. Digital anomalies are not an issue on this disc. The audio has been cleaned up and is nicely presented.  EXTRAS: None.
BOTTOM LINE: If you're a cinema war junky, then ""Crash Dive"" will suit you tastes. But it does not represent the best of genre by any means. The DVD's middle of the road picture quality is a let down.",1085443200,57,1681,4.936395759717315
560125,4,6303102484,"Filmed as the actual battle for the Atlantic was taking place is the 1943 drama ""Crash Dive"" starring Tyrone Powers. These types of movies are a common phenomenon during wartime to help lift peoples spirits on the homefront and drum up patriotic fervor. Here the American sailors are fighting the good fight against the despicable Nazi war machine.
However, this DVD offers a surprise. It is actually a very well made and entertaining adventure movie with enough splashes of romantic subplot and action to keep everyone in the family happy.
Powers plays a PT boat crewmember who is unwillingly transferred as executive officer aboard a submarine based out of the New London, Conn. base. Initially he gets along well with his new captain until he realizes that the two of them are in love with the same woman. The two must learn to trust one another and work together to investigate a mysterious ship in the mid-Atlantic and destroy the secret German island base that is being used by the Nazi's as a staging point for attacks on the Allied shipping lanes.
Filmed on location with the full cooperation of the War Department the movie is presented in technicolor and although the color on the DVD transfer is somewhat saturated it is still relatively clear of blemishes. Where the DVD is lacking however is in special features merely offering a selection of trailers of the other Fox war titles.",1083283200,91,1393,4.832635983263598

But the focus in Crash Dive is different,  spending a considerable amount of time off the submarine as Tyrone Power  and Dana Andrews clash over the affections of an incredibly beautiful Anne  Baxter.  The performances are as good as you could expect with this kind of  material, and the action scenes are quite effective.  But it's the kind of  movie you can watch and then forget pretty soon afterwards.  It's  entertaining, but without much impact.",952819200,33,624,4.847619047619047

You guessed it while Dewey is away Bob discovers Jean and beats him to the question. Jean says sure; she just forgot to tell ether of the men about the other.

One of the interesting things about this movie is that instead of good guy - bad guy, both officers are good guys and it takes both personalities to accomplish the missions.
