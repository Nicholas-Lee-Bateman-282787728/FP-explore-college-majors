8202077,5,B000ROOFEQ,I was looking for a tape that would suit my 93 year young Father.  It was a little strenuously for him but just right for me.  I was going to the Senior Center with my Father taking a balance challenge class but the instructor move away.  So I started looking for videos that would suit both of us. This one fitted me perfectly but was a little to much for my Dad.  I picked Easy Does It! Staying Fit for my Dad which we both do together and I end with Safe & Fit.  Dad says when he gets a little stronger he will try some of the workout of Safe & Fit.,1381190400,2,552,3.849557522123894
8202078,5,B000ROOFEQ,"Great to have three people doing the exercises, each at a different level of ability, from beginning exerciser to exerciser at moderate rate, to wow! look at how tough you can make each exercise!  Usually I am with the Moderate level, but occasionally still get tired enough to revert to Beginner for awhile, then back to Moderate level as we continue.  No breaks, I can easily go from one level to another, and this video will last a lo-o-o-o-o-n-n-n-ng-g-g time, because that Expert level is way in the future, if ever.  Highly recommended.",1379289600,3,542,4.806451612903226

8202080,5,B000ROOFEQ,"I'm an older person, but I love to dance.  I have been doing zumba for a few years.  A doctor said that we should be doing strength exercises for our health.  I mix this up with zumba, walking and Richard Simmons videos.  I feel that it gives me a good balance of exercise that I can do in my own home at my own time.",1350345600,3,317,3.830769230769231
