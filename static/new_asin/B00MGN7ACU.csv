8672127,5,B00MGN7ACU,"I am in awe of this re-presentation of the Bach St. Matthew Passion, a masterwork that I have revisited almost annually for the past thirty-some years.  The musicianship of all concerned is astounding, but even more the evident thoughtfulness that each musician put into his or her performance.  The light staging aside (it is mercifully not overdone and, therefore, highly effective without proving distracting), the aural effect of their collective rethinking of the Passion as a dramatic work rather than merely an oratorio has produced one of the most engaging and emotionally-charged renderings I've ever heard or witnessed.  Each musician preaches, prays, proclaims, laments, objects; no one merely sings here or plays an obbligato part.

Padmore is simply perfect for the role of the Evangelist/Narrator.  Thoughtful, tender, and still technically perfect, each phrase is an act of careful interpretation and a study in vocal control.  I'm simply stunned.  Each of the four soloists likewise brought together superb musicianship, delightful tone and pitch control, and deeply thoughtful and personal realization of the arias.  I shouldn't mention physical conditions, I suppose, in a review, but the fact that the soprano soloist was able to sing so superbly while (I would guess) seven or eight months' pregnant simply defies logic.  The mezzo seemed the most ""into"" the dramatic aspect of the four and delivered quite a range of emotions across the arias assigned to her.  Am amazing ""Erbarm dich.""  The tenor soloist's tone throughout, and vocal facility with, two arias of what I would call an uncharitably high tessitura on Bach's part was amazing.  He was a joy to listen to.  And the bass reminded me of Dietrich Fisher-Diskau for richness of tone, elegance of diction, and range of expression.  I actually was moved to tears by his ""Mache dich"" (and by the chorus's final ""Wir setzen uns"").  I loved the way the obbligato instruments came forward as soloists in their own right, really performing a duet with the vocal soloist.  The interplay between flute and soprano, violin and alto, oboe and tenor just gave a new level of energy to each of these arias.  Special kudos to the amazing woman playing the viola da gamba. OMGoodness for the way she was executing that very difficult part in such a way as may it sound as effortless as a butterfly flapping its wings.  So please, avail yourself of this amazing performance.  You may still be able to catch it at the Berlin Philharmonic's website before committing to the cost of the DVD but, once you do, you'll think nothing of purchasing it.  It is simply top drawer in every way.",1492905600,2,2646,5.011441647597254
