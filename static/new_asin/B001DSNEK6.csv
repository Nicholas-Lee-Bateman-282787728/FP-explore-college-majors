3538050,3,B001DSNEK6,I saw this movie in the Sci-Fi channel and its good for what it is. The effects were good for a low budget film and a reasonable plot. Some flaws are that it has a few implausible events and it feels distant as being a sequel of the first two films. Lake Placid 2 at least feels related to its predecessor.,1220313600,5,306,4.032786885245901

Which is a shocker for an actor such as him. But he pulls it off. While cgi is noticeable, this film was enjoyable to watch of you want a film to chill out too.",1439337600,,451,4.195402298850575

3538085,5,B001DSNEK6,"Is this the greatest snake movie ever made?  Of course not.  Neither is it the worst snake movie ever made.  Instead, it hovers in the twilight region of almost but not quite.  The plot is simple, two snakes are held captive in a secret lab where tests are being made to `improve' them.  They are genetically enhanced to supposedly provide some type of cure for cancer and Alzheimer's.  It is also hoped that they can prolong life.  The research is being funded by a crooked industrialist named Murdoch (John Rhys-Davies).  The dope aggravates the male anaconda into escaping, killing some bystanders on the way out of the complex.  The female also escapes and she is pregnant.  The race is on to recapture or kill these deadly snakes.  David Hasselhoff has a supporting role as Markos Hammett, a mercenary with ulterior motives.  Crystal Allen plays Dr. Amanda Hayes, the mastermind behind the research.  Guilt drives her to kill the snakes.  She's hampered by a sycophant appropriately named Pinkus (Ryan McCluskey).  The action is fundamental for this type of movie (crashed vehicle, explosions, romping through a faux jungle.....).  A group of potential bodies join the hunt, most don't make it to the showdown.  The snakes either squeeze their victim, bite their head off, spear them with their tail, or swallow them whole.  They're like Swiss Army knives, they have a lot of nifty features.  Yes, the CGI is glaringly obvious (they were probably working with a budget of a buck fifty).  The dialog is less then scintillating.  The characters are all stock, no one really distinguishes themselves in the line of duty.  (Rhys-Davies can play this type of role in his sleep.)  Why Hasselhoff is featured as though he was the star is anyone's guess.  Indiana Jones he isn't.

3538097,2,B001DSNEK6,"Under the direction of Don E. Faunt LeRoy, the good folks at SyFy present Anaconda III (2008), a monster on the loose tale featuring a giant, lightning fast, CGI snake.  If you keep your expectations to people being swallowed whole, and vicious snake attacks with plenty of blood, then you should be satisfied.

At a research facility, under the direction of Doctor Amanda Hayes (Crystal Allen), ordinary anacondas are given a serum that causes them to grow to enormous size.  Murdoch (John Rhys-Davies) is charge of the program, and he triggers an incident that causes the reptile to act up, and escape captivity.  A search team is send out into the woods after the snake, lead by Hammett (David Hasselhoff).  The serpent strikes at its pursuers, chomping off heads, or piercing bodies with its deadly tail, slowly reducing the number of the chase party.  Keeping things interesting are those with secrets, and ulterior motives.

The special effects and acting are not the greatest, and the characters are mostly one dimensional, but for what it is, mostly one long chase, the film delivers what you might expect for a SyFy production.  Don E. Faunt LeRoy returns to direct Anacondas: Trail Of Blood (2009), again featuring Crystal Allen as Dr. Amanda Hayes.",1275782400,,1259,4.961904761904762
3538098,1,B001DSNEK6,"The Sci-Fi Channel has sunk to some pretty low depths before, but premiering this Romanian entry into the giant snake genre scrapes the bottom of the barrel. I have seen more than my share of reptiles-gone-amok movies, and ""Anaconda 3: Offspring"" may very well be the worst. It's certainly the worst I can think of after contemplating it for an hour in stunned post-movie silence.

Here's the deal: An evil capitalist drug company wants to make a fortune developing either an anti-aging formula or a cure for cancer (depending which part of the plot you're paying attention to), and to do that they have performed genetic experiments on an anaconda. These experiments do nothing productive as far as I could tell, but they do make the snake more vicious than normal and, oh yeah, make it grow to 60 feet in length and 1,200 pounds. Other than that everything's perfectly normal. These experiments are done by Dr. Amanda Hayes (Crystal Allen), herpetologist in chief and resident leggy blonde. The evil corporation is headed by the nefarious Murdoch (John Rhys-Davies in his most over-the-top performance that I can recall: think William Shatner on steroids), who is angry about a PETA investigation, and offers $10 million for one of the giant snake's babies. Oh I did mention that the humongous snake is a gravid female ready deliver oodles of baby giant anacondas, right?

Anyway, the scurrilous mercenary and tough guy Hammett (Hasselhoff) and his crew chase the giant snake through the Romanian countryside for an hour or so, getting picked off one by one in gory but unrealistic scenes. The film is extremely bloody, unnecessarily so, in fact, but the special effects are among the worst in a recent film. The CGI snake is absolutely awful, and the point at which reality meets computer imaging makes for frequent eye rolling: it is absolutely terrible. There are many scenes of the snake constricting and eating people, and they would be scary if they weren't so badly executed. The worst scene in the movie is when one of the snake hunters is ambushed by the giant snake striking from the top of a barn and biting his head off. Decapitation should be scary, but the unbelievable arterial bleeding reminded me of the bleeding from the lion in the old Monty Python ""Scott of the Antarctic"" sketch. Truly, I cannot emphasize how pitiful the effects are.

Hasselhoff goes around beating people up, biting the ends off cigars, bragging how great he is, and letting his greed lead him, all the while saying choice lines like ""I intend on getting a nice new pair of anaconda snakeskin boots."" It turns out that Hasselhoff is involved in a backroom deal with Murdoch to preserve a snake (profits first, safety second...) which arouses the ire of Dr. Hayes, who, it turns out has a black belt in some rare form of martial art, and a switchblade, which she promptly uses on Hammett. In the stirring conclusion, she puts a bomb in the building where the snake and its spawn are, sets it for sixty seconds, says a few ironic things to Hammett, and leaves. Hammett struggles for the bomb, trying to overcome the grievous stabbing he's been dealt, and as the scene draws to its explosive conclusion, he is not only suffering from his impalement and beating at the hands of the fair Dr. Hayes, he is also being enveloped in the icy embrace of the snake, while being blown up. That's a bad way to die, but justice can be a harsh mistress.

Not only does the film blow the big-picture things, it can't even get the smallest details right: why did the screenwriters have Dr. Hayes call the snake ""slimy,"" for instance? Snakes are dry, as anyone with a Ph. D. in herpetology should know. Of course that's the least of this movie's problems, but it still annoyed me for some reason. I will not divulge the conclusion of the film (as if you couldn't guess), but sadly I will say that it makes it quite clear that ""Anaconda 4"" was in the offing even before the action wrapped up on this installment.

The film did have one bright spot: it showed lots of scenic areas around Bucharest, Romania where it's really cheap to make a movie, as it turns out. Few Hollywood regulars were used, and most of the cast appears to have been recruited locally (e.g. Bogdan Uritescu, Alin Constantinescu, Gabi Burlacu, and Zoltan Butuc, to name but a few), but they did as well as any of the central hams in the big roles.

I am a huge fan of camp classics, and bad movies of every genre. Even I have my limits, though, and this film has crossed the boundary from so-bad-it's-good to so-bad-I-can-hardly-bear-to-watch-it. Aside from the beauty of the Romanian countryside, I find absolutely nothing to recommend ""Anaconda 3: Offspring"".",1275436800,,4705,4.738705738705739

3538102,1,B001DSNEK6,"Admittedly the first ""Anaconda"" was not a masterpiece, but it was still fun. Well, it was campy fun, to be exact, with the snake hunter Jon Voight and his (intentionally, I guess) hammy acting that made the 1997 film an instant classic of the ""so-bad-so-good"" films. Sorry, but ""Anaconda III"" is no fun.

In the third ""Anaconda"" David Hasselhoff plays a mercenary leading his snake hunting team. John Rhys-Davies appears as billionaire spending lots of money on some questionable experiments. Crystal Allen is a scientist who warns ... well, in short, the story is nothing special. Two anacondas escape from the facilities and eat people. That's it. But the list of the actors is at least interesting and their acting is OK.

The role of David Hasselhoff is not very big. He is the star of the film, but only in the second half and after the opening where he briefly appears, you have to wait for him to show up quite long.

I don't expect much from the straight-to-DVD film, but the special effects are so cheesy. Still some may find these cheap effects mildly amusing, like one silly decapitation scene that results in exploding of a vehicle. Maybe they should have done more of it and the film would have been much less boring.

Some of the stars of the third ""Anaconda"" film will be back in ""Anaconda 4: Trail of Blood."" Just in case if you are interested.",1255651200,,1360,4.630705394190872
3538103,5,B001DSNEK6,"Anaconda 3: Offspring Movie Review

Grade: A-

Offspring had been constantly checked out at my local video rental store, simply due to the popularity of it, and I waited a long time to finally have a chance to rent it, (I missed the SciFi channel airing) before someone else came and got it. Yes, I know a movie with the words SciFi channel, David Hasselhoff, and mutated Anacondas sounds like the worst movie ever, but trust me, it was well worth the wait at the video store.

I don't really understand all the negative reviews here, and I know I'm like a fish swimming the wrong way from the school, but this truly is a fun, entertaining movie. The title of my review is basically the entire plot, in all its extremely gory glory. (The movie gets really graphic at times, with the snake stabbing people, throwing up animals, and biting off heads...)

But of course, since it's a SciFi channel movie, it definitely has its flaws. The CGI is just terrible; the snakes looking like something out of a rejected horror video game. At the end of the movie, it seems like the director ran out of CGI money, and the baby snakes at the end are simply a type of Corn snake, and don't even look remotely like baby anacondas. But the rest of the special effects money seemed to be spent pretty well; there are great explosions galore littered throughout the movie.
As for the acting: kind of forced, like the actors were trying to hard, but better than typical SciFi fare. David Hasselhoff actually isn't too bad...key words being ""too bad""...

So if you want to spend your Saturday night like I did watching this movie, go ahead: after all, what better way of spending a Saturday night do have other than watching giant snakes attack David Hasselhoff?",1241049600,9,1742,4.57051282051282
3538104,1,B001DSNEK6,"Seriously, anyone that thinks this hunk of garbage is even a decent movie has the lowest standards on the planet! The first Anaconda was the only good one. It had everything, decent cast, great acting(mostly Jon Voight), perfect setting, awesome aninatronics, and the snake actually looked like a real Green Anaconda! Not to mention suspense which The Hunt For Blood Orchid and this low budget butt leakage sorely lacks.

If you're going to call a movie ""Anaconda"" and it's supposed to be about a giant ANACONDA eating people, doesn't it make sense to have the snake look like an ANACONDA?! Even with CGI, they still can't make a decent snake! The ones in the second film looked almost like really big elapids(cobras, mambas, etc), and the ones in this movie look like freakin' vipers! I swear I saw one scene in which the snake actually had fangs!

And not only that, but this film is a rip-off of the Python movies, which are rip-offs of the first Anaconda! The snake is genetically modified instead of being a natural animal, the snake is oddly intelligent, it stares down its prey like it recognizes them, and it impales people with its tail more often than it constricts them. ALL of these are staples of the Python movies.

The only decent actor in this entire film was David Hasselhoff, and that should tell you everything you need to know about this film.

Characters suck, effects suck, CGI sucks, snakes suck, weapons suck, cast sucks, acting sucks, and the plot sucks. Add all this up and you get another Sci-fi channel original suckfest that's not original at all. Really, how sad is it when a movie has to rip-off movies that are already rip-offs? Well, it gets a lot sadder when the rip-off of the rip-offs is the next installment of the series that started the whole damn thing!",1234483200,3,1793,4.682539682539683

THE OFFSPRING

Remember when J-Lo, Jon Voight and Ice Cube were battling a giant Anaconda, or when another group led by a J-Lo look a like did the same thing but against more, yeah those were the days. Well it seems that those days of a big budget [at least compared to this] theatrical released Anaconda movie are gone. But being that I am a fan of any and everything low budget I decided that I would give this a try, I bought it in order to have the whole collection. But that aside I still went into this knowing that it was a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so I knew it was probably not a classic.

I try to stay positive in most of my reviews because I know how much work went it these types of things but it is hard to get past the look of this film. Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with a low budget movie but compared to the first two it is hard to ignore. I would say that this looks a lot like ""Lake Placid 2"" so if you have seen that film you know what I am talking about, although that film may look better than this one. Another thing that gets me is the look of the snakes, I know this is a low budget film but the snakes from ""Python"" and ""Boa"" look better then these. On the plus side for a film like this it was shot pretty well thanks to Don E. FauntLeRoy that may be one of the few pluses to how the film looks.

I hate to say things like this but another thing that drags this film down a little is the script by David C. Olson and Nicholas Davidoff. It may not be the worst thing ever written but it still has its flaws, the story line in particular seems like every other creature running amuck type flick. The film is about a secret laboratory [can you see where this is going?] were tests are being done on over sized snakes, in fact it is the test drug that is making the snakes so big apparently. Well as if you did not know the snakes break loose and are out and about looking for some food. In comes the ""professionals"" that are called in to take care of this little problem. I know what you are thinking it sounds a lot like every other b creature feature, well you are right. I can't believe that a franchise that was based somewhat in reality has now become this. Director Don E. FauntLeRoy seems to do what he can with the script as the pace of the film moves along nicely and for the most part for this type of film the direction seems good. But the performances needed a little more work.

David Hasselhoff [yes that one] is actually pretty good in this film and makes for a believable snake hunter, especially towards the end his performance gets real good. John Rhys-Davies does a good job as expected for the short time he is in the film, as does the guy who plays Davis's right hand man who goes on the hunt with them. But other then those few everyone else ranges from average to just plain bad, are as disappointed as me?  I really wanted this movie to be more then it was but I guess I have to settle with what I got. To be honest this film is not horrible it is just nothing note worthy, buy it if you want the collection but remember that a forth film in the series is coming.",1229904000,6,3132,4.069692058346839

The other 2 Anaconda movies actually saw theatrical release, so obviously they have the look and feel of a ""real"" Hollywood movie. Anaconda 3 on the other hand, looks and feels cheap.

FauntLeRoy, Anaconda 3: Offspring  chronicles events in Eastern Europe when two oversized mutated anacondas break free from a pharmaceutical research facility and must be hunt down, caught or killed. David Hasselhoff plays the lead hunter while Crystal Allen appears as the concerned herpetologist (snake expert). John Rhys-Davies is also on hand as the curmudgeon pharmaceutical mogul.

This is the first in the franchise released to TV rather than theatrically. To be expected (with the much lower budget), its also the least up to this point. Yet it still has its highlights for those who enjoy nature-runs-amok flicks. Crystal is the main protagonist and is stunning throughout while Hasselhoff is charismatic as the arrogant great white hunter, although he doesnt become a prominent character until the second half.

Theres loads of gory action as the quasi-militarists try to hunt down the CGI snakes, mostly in the woods. Blood spills and heads get bitten off, but the vibe is more cartoony than the first two films. The cast keeps things mostly serious with amusing bits here and there, yet you might find yourself busting out laughing at some of the brutal attacks. The thoroughly ravishing Cristina Teodorescu has a glorified cameo; too bad she didn't have a bigger role.

Unfortunately, unlike Flu Bird Horror, which was shot at the same time and in the same locations, Anaconda 3 lacks compelling human interest and meaty subtext beyond the hackneyed Dont conduct genetic experiments on animals. Still, its pretty effective as a simplistic action/gore-oriented creature feature. There are some marking-time moments though, like the tedious barn and factory sequences.

THE MOVIE RUNS 91 minutes and was shot in Bucharest & Danube Delta, Romania. WRITERS: Nicholas Davidoff & David C. Olson.
