8407498,5,B003WQB2OW,"It was the richest purse ever offered for a long distance sled dog race: $100,000.00 winner take all! The top mushers of the day brought their mandatory pokes of gold and signed on for the historic run: Lance Mackey, Jeff King, Mitch Seavey, Sonny Lindner and fourteen others left the starting chute on Front Street for the 408-mile run across the remote Seward Peninsula to Candle and back. They'd be running trails made famous by Leonhard Seppala, ""Scotty"" Allan, ""Iron Man"" Johnson, and many other renowned Alaskan mushers. They'd be running with the spirits of the greatest sled dog races ever held.

""Running with Spirits,"" by Husky Productions, is a two hour commemorative DVD which celebrates the famous All Alaska Sweepstakes, the first major long distance sled dog race in the world. The film, produced by multiple Emmy award-winning videographer Donna Quante, tells the colorful story of the centennial running of this iconic race in 2008, when the townspeople of Nome successfully recaptured the excitement and history of the gold rush era in Alaska.

Hauntingly beautiful original music by Kyf Brewer and Jim Parkinson highlight this video journal of the 2008 All Alaska Sweepstakes. Donna's camera takes the viewer behind the scenes as mushers get ready for the race, following the special events associated with the historic running, and counting down the exciting start as the spectators recreate the historic ""human chute"" to see the mushers off. Mark Hegener's stunning video footage of each team leaving the chute puts the viewer right in the action, and then the story moves to checkpoints out on the trail, showcasing some of the most desolately beautiful country in Alaska.

Interviews with checkpoint volunteers, veterinarians, pilots, judges and the mushers themselves give an insider's perspective and a feeling for what it was like to be in Nome during this incredible time. Wrapping up the whole marvelous visual package is the viewer's ticket to the All Alaska Sweepstakes banquet, with a vintage menu inspired by the 1906 banquet, and many heart-warming surprises and delights in the Sweepstakes Awards Ceremony.

The film is supplemented with incredible still photography from master photographer Jan DeNapoli, who shares her experience at the Council checkpoint. ""Running with Spirits"" captures all the excitement, the history, and the ongoing legacy of Alaska's premier sled dog race, the All Alaska Sweepstakes.",1280016000,7,2443,5.288659793814433
