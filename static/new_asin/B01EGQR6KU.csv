8758670,5,B01EGQR6KU,"Enjoyed the movie immensely.  It was my introduction to Sanjay Leela Bhansali and I fell in love with the cinematography.  Amitabh's role was at times extremely moving.  Rani is always a joy.  Highly recommended interpretation of a life, very similar to Helen Keller.",1483056000,,267,5.1395348837209305
