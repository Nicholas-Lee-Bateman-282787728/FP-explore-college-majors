8444902,3,B004WCSMES,"So so. Was expecting more. Starts strong but gets bogged down. Two plus hours & not much story. Also parts seem too absurd for a social realism, kitchen sink drama. Not on level of other gritty, Glaswegian classics like My Name is Joe or Ratcatcher.",1464307200,,249,4.555555555555555

8444904,1,B004WCSMES,one hour forty five minutes of this movie was brilliant.. last fifteen was absolute trash...writer and director must have done another acid tab to destroy a movie with such promise,1442361600,,180,5.033333333333333
8444905,5,B004WCSMES,"Good movie about a young male child who had the best start in his youth and strong perseverance to prove himself considering his environment, but that still could not preserve him as it all eroded by the hostility of his teachers who wrote him off as a punk and his peers and neighborhood culture that made a monster out of him. It was really fascinating to watch it as a period piece of 70's delinquent culture in the rough parts of the UK.",1392422400,,441,4.325301204819277
8444906,3,B004WCSMES,"A next story of gray British commoners' daily routine when good boy is pressed by peers to be rude, sexist and offensive -with body-harming off hands and ambiguous ending.

I hardly know what was the most highlighted-stupidity or ignorance of so-called egocentrics towards everything and everyone as the final stills provided?",1355097600,,326,5.392156862745098
8444907,5,B004WCSMES,"Excellent film, I just finished seeing it for the third time.  There are the obvious reasons, believable acting, gritty realism, totally convincing story-line.  But what I love about this film is that the tragic protagonist always does his best, even while sinking ever-lower in his quest to overcome his psychological injuries.  These have been caused by his father, mainly, and his other family members who are either in denial (the aunt) or totally passive (the mother) or rebellious (the brother).  But he is always swimming, desperately to keep his head above the cesspool of his surroundings.  It is one of the best illustrations of nature versus nurture that I have seen.  And there are poetic moments, poignant moments, small comic moments in the mix. And in the end, as the protagonist braves the menacing lions (wonderfully symbolic of his challenges in general) dragging his ex-victim by the hand to safety, it is an illustration of redemption and hope that sticks wholesomely in my mind.  I have high hopes for him.
I can't stress enough how good the acting was in this film.  Another reviewer seems to have missed, or misunderstood, that ""woodenness"" is an integral protection mechanism in a world like this one.  As is violence. As is aggregation to a group for self-defense.  My compliments to the director for his contributions, both acting and directing.  I look forward to more from him, and more from the cast.  Six stars.",1351468800,,1441,4.958333333333333
8444908,1,B004WCSMES,"I was taken by the title of another one star review I came across [Amazon UK], ""Not exactly dynamite"", which is a very understated summary of the film.

I wonder, is this film meant only to titillate and excite people who don't see this kind of thing, or people who do see this kind of thing? What the hell is it for? It's awful. It reminds of those legion of really awful, truly dire, British films that really crap directors and their film buff luvvies love to celebrate as being the opposite of Hollywood. Which are in fact much worse than the worst tat from Hollywood, films like ""Scum"", awful films that people keep saying are great and ""landmarks"".

Just what is great about films like these? Just what is good at all about ""NEDS""? Oh yes, I know people like the characters in this film existed in the 1970s and later, and there are variants today. But that's no excuse for a quite sadistic voyeuristic exercise in screen violence with really no plot even to carry that along. The pretend plot, better to call it just a storyboard of violent scenes is this: a young boy who was a well behaved schoolboy who did well in lessons, becoming one of the worst young thugs within gangs of the worst young thugs to be found anywhere. That's not a plot. It's a suggestion for a plot which has yet to come. Anyone at all could take this suggestion and quickly fill in a succession of violent scenes to make ""NEDS"", and would do so with more art than the actual makers of ""NEDS"". It really is a pile of utter rubbish.

Some people will tell you there is a plot: a kind of story in a few short sentences, filmed very slowly over a couple of hours. But with such a cancerous bare suggestion for a film, who needs a plot at all? That seems to be the logic. It's just excuse after excuse for disgusting, extreme violence that is meant to shock.

There's nothing else in there, except for a very quickly played out suggestion that the teachers hadn't a clue how to develop boys, and no doubt were a catalyst for the delinquency and thuggery which developed. Oh. Good point, made in a couple of scenes, to make way for scene after scene of pointless, voyeuristic violence.

Is there any real message in there? I can't find any, except the usual ""this is how it is there"". Some people find that artistic enough. Yes, film and writing shouldn't ignore simply expressing the kind of things which happen in parts which are different to how most people live.

But I think this film, as well as a piece of empty voyeurism, is being severely patronising, and disrespectful to the areas and people which are the basis for these kinds of film. ""You don't even get a proper story, you don't get any message or analysis, or likeable character development in the film made out to be about what goes on around you. You don't even get a positive message out of it."" I thought there was no evidence of any humanity at all in the cardboard characters. As for the parents, they were made of wood, and I thought a 5 year old made the character concepts, knowing it to be a short story to learn writing and words.

Terrible film. Really terrible. I feel sympathy for the young actors, as I don't know what acting roles they'll be able to find after this film, and I wonder if they were aware of that.

I had the feeling that the film makers could have been thinking a statement, ""We are E.D.s [educated delinquents], here are some realistic, fictional N.E.D.S. [non-educated delinquents]. There is loads and loads of extreme, graphic violence, and we take your money. That's it, party's over, go home."" What is the point of this film?",1332374400,3,3604,4.458270106221548
8444909,5,B004WCSMES,"NEDS or Non Educated Delinquents (which is a bacronym) is slang for 'chav' or in America I would suggest 'redneck'. This is a Film 4 production from Peter Mullan (writer, director and actor). He was responsible for the excellent `Magdalene Sisters'. This is set in early 1970's Glasgow and focuses on John McGill, who is doing rather well at school despite his dysfunctional home life. His mother is a bag of nerves and in denial about her rubbish life, his father is a drunken bully and his older brother is a Ned. He then starts Secondary school and soon realises that survival needs more than just studying.

His brothers' reputation leads other gang bullies to accept him as one of them and the pupil soon becomes the teacher. This is an excellently observed piece of film making. I could relate to so much of it, the fact that he would watch `Robinson Crusoe' (French black and white serial that the BBC would show in the summer holidays) with the curtains drawn, teachers smoking and the corporeal punishment from those same teachers. And the sound track is spot on with the likes of `The Sweet' and `Wizard' to name but two.

The acting is superb, but a word on the accents, they are broad Glaswegian, and may prove a bit hard to understand in places, Mullan has gone for authenticity over clarity if you get my meaning, and fair play to him for that. He actually used real Neds; one had to be let out of remand to finish it.

He has been criticised for stereotyping working class people as drunken thugs or bullies, but I grew up in a situation which mirrored a lot of what took place here and for me it had a lot of resonance and therefore came across as very real and very believable.

It is not a short film at 124 minutes but it does fly by. There are frequent scenes of violence and very strong language throughout, but that is the reality of how it was and in some places still is, only the police are not quite as rubbish as portrayed here. It is not primarily about gang culture, but more a study in nurture over nature, and living in a very macho centric world. I gave it five stars as I loved it and hope you will too; I look forward to the next offering from Mr Mullan.",1308096000,2,2188,4.3817733990147785
