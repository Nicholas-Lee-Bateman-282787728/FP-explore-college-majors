The movie is a winner on sweetness alone.  But the fact that much of the movie is done in sign as Eddie Peng tries to win the heart of a girl he struggles to communicate with in sign, makes it fairly unique.  There are movies where one see persons communicate in sign, but never so much flirting, laughing, gentle teasing and sometimes arguing in sign as in this film.  I highly recommend it.

The film doesn't seem to be available except as a Region 3 DVD or on Bluray, so don't bother looking for a Region 1 or 0 copy.

By the way, Amazon here claims it's a R-rated movie.  I'm presuming that's a mistyping of NR (not rated).  If it were rated in the US, it would be a PG.",1363392000,,845,4.23125
