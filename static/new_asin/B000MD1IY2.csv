8167921,4,B000MD1IY2,"""A Film By Aravind"" concerns a film director (named Arrvind, according to the subtitles) and a ""hero"" from his films, who decide to go to the director's country house to discuss some scripts.  The one script in particular that was of interest, however, had ink spilled on all the pages past a certain point, but since Arrvind liked it up to that point, I guess he wants to try to resurrect the rest of the script.

On the way to his country house, though, events begin to mirror the script up to a certain point, as they pick up a gorgeous hitchiker whose car broke down (Neeru), and then a scruffy motorcyclist who wrecked his bike after ""misbehaving"" with Neeru.  But the script only goes to a certain point, so what happens after that?  Well, nothing that was exactly in anyone's plans.  Neeru & the movie hero elope & get married, Arrvind is heartbroken & depressed, but he also begins to think that there's something very wrong with Neeru and that she might even be the mysterious serial killer they've been hearing about on the news.  And things continue to get out of control and even more scary.

This is a very clever little film, well done, and while it is pretty obscure, it's worth seeking out.  The dialog is in Telugu, but it does have subtitles so no worries there.  It has its moments of humor too, but it's definitely not a horror/comedy (thank God).  When it really takes off, it's not so frightening that it'll scare you into nightmares, but it's quite suspenseful & gets rather creepy toward the end.  Definitely worth a look, if you're into different kinds of films.  4 out of 5.",1251158400,,1600,4.536585365853658
