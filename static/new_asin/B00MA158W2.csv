8671026,5,B00MA158W2,"I'm going to get the negatives out of the way because Lynn Anderson is my favorite singer of all time in any genre, any generation, male or female. I listen and buy country/western, classic rock, metal, alternative rock & country, Mo-town, pop, soundtracks amongst others as well! I own every single 33 LP album she has recorded and have some 45's as well. I have every CD of every original release. I own many of the prolific CDs that are compilations and have some with just different artwork.

It was a highlight of my life to get to see her at the old Capri Ballroom in Atlanta in the very late 70's or very, very early 80's. I was blessed to have an unobstructed table view of just five to seven feet away and took photos, got to meet her and she signed an autograph as well.

My credentials thus established. This is slightly a slightly screwed up production. The track listings on the cover do not match up with the DVD. Track one is, I guess you could say, is a bonus version of Heartbreak Hotel rather than the listed: I Love How You Love Me. These first two tracks are plagued by an old VHS tape glitch - at the top of the screen you see a rainbow prism like color ""bar"".  Next we are treated to a living room with roaring fire with Lynn looking very beautiful and singing You're My Man as great as she ever did!

The next track is a warm & enthusasticlly cheerful Lynn - colorfully dressed, singing her very surprisingly awesome version of the Drifter's: Under The Boardwalk, which Lynn makes a fun time swaying a long song. This, like the first two tracks, are VHS quality so do not expect any HD quality.  Rocky Top is taken from another live VHS but features a beautiful Lynn with Larry Gatlin and Ray Charles, yes, Ray Charles! Lynn's more modern: Even Cowgirls Get The Blues features her looking great wearing a cowboy(girl) hat and the video quality, while not HD, is terrific compared to the VHS track segments. Next we are to Lynn's: That's A No No, not VHS nor HD quality but pretty good. According to the track listings we should hear: Top of The World, instead we get a treat of her singing: He'd Still Love Me. Next we have a VHS quality 1982 performance of Cry. There are microphone issues which greatly diminishes her lovely singing covering Johnny Ray's 1950 hit.

What should be this DVD 's epic moment is spoiled by a lack of original volume recording which is way too low. Yes, video quality is good but the audio sucks on, yes, of all tunes: Rose Garden. Next a VHS quality of her singing Nancy Sinatra's signature tune: These Boots Are Made For Walking which Lynn covers nicely. Next Lynn (with guest Jerry Reed) covers John Denver's: Thank God I'm A Country Boy very well, in VHS quality.

If you're a fellow Lynn Anderson nut most certainly buy this. Though the track listings on the case are wrong there is still a lot of good stuff here not seen on other Lynn DVD 's. Buy it any way.",1438905600,4,2918,4.392592592592592
