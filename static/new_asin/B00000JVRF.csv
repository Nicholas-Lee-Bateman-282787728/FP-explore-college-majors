7913540,4,B00000JVRF,"Congas, Djembes, Ashikos, Dumbeks, Council Drums, Cowbells, Shakeres and every other form of world percussion is presented here on tape in play along format.  This video brings back memories of my happy hippie days and ""zoning in the domes"" at UC Davis. Everyone has a percussion instrument, and they are in a circle having a great time playing together. The infamous wild chickens of UCD are dancing around the circle. Geodesic Domes are the backdrop, an old university experiment in alternative housing. The rooster has too much competition for noise and is going nuts. This is an out of decade experience. However, if you can get past your 21st century biases and pick up an instrument, like I have seen many children do, it can be extremely fun. I teach world percussion and do school demonstrations.  The children are eager to participate.  Along with demonstrations of foods of the world, this is a great inroad to international understanding for school age children.  Each peice on the video is broken down into four for four core players.  On screen sheet music preceeds each peice.  The group is comprised of 12 to 15 people, from novice to advanced. Everyone is contributing whatever they can offer.
I would really like to see a second effort on DVD.  There is only one native player on this tape, and I would like to see more native cultures represented with background information presented on the instruments.  If you are willing to drum along, this format is loads of fun and much cheaper than therapy.",1057363200,18,1516,4.848837209302325
