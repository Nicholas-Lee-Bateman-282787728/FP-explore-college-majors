8522080,2,B007V2LN7O,Before purchasing this I looked up the movie plots. Most if not all looked to be quite interesting (to a horror fan at least). I watched the first two and found them to be pretty dang bad. I wasn't expecting Oscar worthly films but these are even too bad for someone that likes bad movies. Avoid.,1362960000,5,296,4.303571428571429
8522081,4,B007V2LN7O,"Four horror titles on two DVDs is not the best ingredient for crystal clarity, but these films are just rare enough to merit the cheap price. These are not well-known films are were made on the cheap, so don't go in expecting high production values. Some of the films are very well done, while others are nothing but crap.",1359504000,,322,4.47457627118644

8522084,5,B007V2LN7O,"Last fall I saw the movie Plastic in Chicago.  It's perfect for the summer of 2012 - it's set in the suburbs during a record-breaking heat wave.  The story grabs you right away, the horror could be real, and it could take place next door to anyone.  It's a movie I couldn't forget.  So glad to find it available in DVD.",1342828800,15,319,4.180327868852459
