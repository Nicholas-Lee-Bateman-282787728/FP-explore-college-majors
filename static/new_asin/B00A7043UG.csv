Very much mediocre.",1425600000,,354,4.461538461538462
8547407,2,B00A7043UG,"The first 20 minutes seems like an hour, the next 20 minutes is passable and the last part of the movie is full of action sequences (finally). It seemed like it took forever to get to the actual movie and then it is an odd combination of stupid,insane and surreal. Even for a B movie, this is bad, your time might be better served reading a novel in a language you don't understand. Pass on this volume of Fighting Express and watch something else",1382227200,2,447,4.333333333333333
