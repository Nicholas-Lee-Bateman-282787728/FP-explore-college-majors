4460572,1,B004RE29T0,"I realize for many, reviewing a movie release on Amazon before the release date is an unpardonable sin, but lets face it, without early reviews buyers would not get important info needed to make a buying decision when Amazon offers none. In this case it is more a questioning of the fact that this release offers nothing in the way of special features. At $23.99, a bare bones release is a half-a@@ disgrace. It isn't as if producing material would have cost CBS-Fox more money since the anthology set is packed full of them. Why then could they not be generous enough to include those extras that pertain to the original? Some of us revere the original and avoid the franchise like the plague. Are we to be penalized? If you are going to offer a barebones edition, then sell it at a barebones price. I know what a barebones price looks like on Amazon and it ain't $23.99. Try $15. Is this another attempt to sell the product twice, once on Blu-Ray with no features and then again later with extras? Count me out.",1303344000,13,1013,4.481081081081081

4460598,5,B004RE29T0,"This Blu-ray version has greatly improved detail and color over previous DVD versions. The sound is vivid and immersive. Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score sounds menacing as ever.

Yes, the movie turns very ugly after its first 30 minutes. But until then, it boasts a fair amount of visual beauty. The alien ship nestled in the mountains laced with mists and fogs; the long (perhaps too long) tracking shots of the ship's interiors that show off the magnificent level of detail in the sets; and the always eerie reflection of monitors in crash helmets. There's much to enjoy.

The movie is more focused than some think, mostly around themes of indifference. The crew perceives the cat as a pet, but really it's loyal only until its next feeding. When Kane's guts explode all over the place, shock and disgust wipe clean any traces of compassion and sorrow. The corporation is indifferent to the crew, and the crew itself has just finished tearing millions of tons of ore from the bowels of some unfortunate planet. And of course you have the full-grown alien--a perfect alter ego and complement to modern mega-corporations if ever there were one.

Ensemble acting is way above the norm for this kind of movie. Sigourney Weaver gives a career-making performance that also created the first female action hero. Lara Croft, Aeon Flux, and Kate Beckinsale's Selene all trace back to Ellen Ripley.

My final kudo goes to Ridley Scott. He openly admits that the 1979 Alien is his preferred version. He also says that he let 20th Century Fox persuade him to release a ""Director's Cut"" to let viewers make their own choice. It would've been easier and more lucrative to follow the studio and tell people that he preferred the ""Director's Cut."" But he respected the fans instead. What can I say but ""What a guy!""",1470182400,,1800,4.815533980582524

4460617,5,B004RE29T0,"It's fairly common knowledge that some, especially critics, say this film hasn't aged well. The usual things cited are things like dated special effects, a slow pace, an obviously low budget, and that it just isn't that great by today's higher standards. Whether or not you're in the camp that agrees with this or not, or even if you haven't seen it yet, just be informed that they're insane. If you're wondering, ""Wow, are they insane?"" then yes, you now know with certainty. This is obviously one of the best sci-fi horror films ever made for a variety of reasons, the biggest ones being atmosphere and cohesive storytelling, and I could go on for a long time about it, but it has never really been topped at any point in time. Actually, sci-fi horror has been a dead genre for quite some time primarily because it doesn't sell that well, and has a rather poor profit ratio due to the whole sci-fi thing upping budgets more than, say, a conventional slasher flick would. With film being so exclusive now where everything has to be a hit or it's never seeing the light of day, you just don't get film like this anymore, because it's not really permitted in the industry. It's kind of a shame, but if nothing else, we'll probably always have this to come back to, to remember what sci-fi horror is supposed to be like.",1462406400,32,1318,4.542016806722689

Includes both original 1979 release and also 2003 director's cut.  The director's cut is alright, but I prefer the 1979 original.  If you have never seen this movie, definitely start with the 1979 original.  The director's cut sidetracks and screws up the sequence of events. The editors knew what they were doing when they cut out those scenes that Ridley Scott put back in.  In fact, why Scott would re-include the scene of the shuttle and Nostromo at the end is beyond me, that by itself basically ruins the Director's Cut, in my opinion.

Aside from that, it's a horror movie, and a sci-fi movie, it really doesn't fit into any specific category.  Sigorney Weaver's character is well-played.  Watchmojo even rated this movie #2 scariest movie of all time, after The Exorcist.",1436313600,,816,4.897810218978102

4460665,5,B004RE29T0,"Presented from an all-new 4K master, Ridley Scotts 1979 slasher-in-space masterpiece delivers on Blu-ray. The picture is stunning, with a fine, but natural film grain providing clarity, enhancing the production design of both the Nostromo itself, and the titular ALIEN that terrorizes first-time horror heroine Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, and a cast of now-legendary actors aboard their isolated ship. While the single-disc original only offers minimal supplements (a pair of commentaries, two different isolated score tracks, and deleted scenes but also two cuts of the film), the Alien Anthology box set (that can be had cheaply if you catch it on sale, as low as $30!) offers comparable extras for all four films (ALIEN, ALIENS, ALIEN3, ALIEN: RESURRECTION), as well as two packed bonus discs including over 12,000 stills combined of photos and artwork, several behind the scenes featurettes, and more.

4460680,5,B004RE29T0,"Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979), is considered by many to be one of the greatest Science-Fiction films ever made and the best in an ever-expanding series (although some will argue 1986's ""Aliens"" is equally good if not better, I love them both).

The film takes place in a space craft called ""The Nostromo"". The unsuspecting crew members receive a distress signal from a nearby planet named ""LV-426"", and decide to investigate. Upon landing, 3 crew members; Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Kane (John Hurt) and Dallas (Tom Skerritt), venture off into the planets bleak, barren atmosphere where Kane, is attacked by a ""face-hugging"" spider-like creature which attaches itself to his face. Although he is in need of medical attention, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is hesitant in letting them back inside. Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm), disregards Ripley's concerns and let's them in.

And so the fun begins as the ""face-hugger"" dies and a silent, omni-potent killer quickly develops inside the unwary victim's chest, waiting for the right moment to make its grand entrance and to wreak havoc on board ""The Nostromo"".

The first time I watched this film, I was 12 and it left me mesmerized. I knew nothing of it. Saw a trailer on TV: ""Sunday at 9:00pm - Alien..."" My thoughts? Cool. That Sunday night, I made some popcorn, turned my channel to CITYTV's ""Great Movies"" and for the next 2.5 hours (with commercials), I was blown away (not to mention my excitement when the cool looking alien finally made its appearance). It instantly became one of my favorite films and several decades later, it remains a favorite. ""Alien"" is a masterpiece. A hallucinatory, dark, gritty, claustrophobic, atmospheric nightmare which combines the best of horror and science-fiction and gave us one of the fiercest monsters ever captured on film (thanks to H.R Giger). The acting from the ensemble cast is first-rate as is the script, direction and the film's pace is virtually flawless. Even during scenes in which nothing much is happening, the dialogue and interaction among the cast is crucial to the films plot. In other words, there is not a single scene that isn't relevant to the film. This was also the film that introduced me to Sigourney Weaver. Her cool, tough Ripley is perfection and how refreshing was it to witness her kicking some extraterrestrial butt in a film made in 1979? Others in the great cast are Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and some pesky, orange cat that created a bit of drama since Ripley couldn't leave the ship without him.

A close to perfect film that deserves to be in everyone's DVD/Blu-ray collection. Double your pleasure and follow it up with James Cameron's equally compelling ""Aliens"". For Sci-Fi fans, I recommend getting the Alien box sets -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Anthology/dp/B001AQO3QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Anthology</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Quadrilogy/dp/B0000VCZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Quadrilogy</a>.

4460685,5,B004RE29T0,"I'm 20 and a huge movie fan. Love all genres from all countries. But I'd never seen Alien. Too young to have seen it in theaters or to even watch it at re-release on DVD. I felt as if for movie fans its a right of passage but I didn't want to see a average movie just because it's very prominent in pop culture. That's why I went so long without seeing it. But I needed something to watch so I ordered this.
  I went into this with caution, not knowing what to expect. At the end I could only think one thing. I absolutely love this movie. The hype is well deserved. It feels so real and grounded. Characters hold real conversations and talk over each other naturally in situations. Something subtle but effective. As if they aren't repeating lines, but actually talking. The acting is top notch. I forgot these were actors and saw them as people after some time. There is a very famous scene that i knew was coming but i was so caught up in these people holding a breakfast conversation that I was still taken by surprise. So job well done.
  When you have that and a well handled horror element, the movie is largely effective. I actually gave a damn about the people on this ship. Something horror movies today can't be bothered to achieve. These people are trapped and it means more to me then it probably should have. Lol All of it done at a slowly creeping pace, building to moments of terror. All while having little moments of character development and plot revaluations.
  I was concerned that the movie would look old even on blu-ray. Once I played it, that quickly subsided. It looks as if it could have been flimed today. Sound design and picture presentation are so well done. The deep black and rich colors make these amazing sets remind me why CG sets don't compare. Also enjoyed the bonus feature and commentary tracks. Not only one of my favorite Sci-fi movie, one of my new favorites in general. Glad I own it.",1421193600,5,1928,4.416901408450705

4460688,5,B004RE29T0,"I think that at this point, this film is so well known, and revered, adding another 5-star review into the mix won't make much of a difference, but what the heck?]

A mining crew hauling back a load of mineral ore from deep space is wakened from hyper sleep when the computer running their ship, the Nostromo, receives a message from a nearby planet. The crew travels to the planet surface to investigate the radio signal, and discover the wreckage of an enormous space ship. While poking around inside the remains of the ship, one of the crewman stumbles across a huge room filled with leathery eggs. As he is examining one of the eggs, it pops open and something jumps out and attaches itself to his face.

Once they get the ""infected"" crewman back to the ship, ""Alien"" becomes a white-knuckle roller coaster ride. Great performances by the entire cast, amazing special F/X which still look great today, and a one-of-a-kind creature are all reasons this film has become a enduring classic. Like ""The Godfather"", the original ""King Kong"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Citizen Kane"", ""Alien"" is one of those must see/must own films.",1419984000,,1126,4.739795918367347
4460689,5,B004RE29T0,"The reason why I like the first Alien Movie is because it focuses on the alien as an animal. It's big, scary, and unpredictable.

It has the director's cut too, which makes it more compelling see what happened to the rest of Ripely's crew.

This is a great horror film, which blends to the sci-fi genre. Because in space no one can hear you scream.

In a pitch-perfect cast, Ian Holm gives one of the two best performances of his career (the other being ""The Sweet Hereafter""); he should have won the Oscar for Supporting Actor (no offense to Melvin Douglas, who did win that year for his fine performance in ""Being There""). Scott's directing has never been better (and he would have been a much more deserving winner than Robert Benton, who won for ""Kramer vs. Kramer"").

It's missing the great, lengthy documentary of the film's inception, it's release and impact on film culture, that accompanied the 2003 Director's Cut release. As a person who loves and studies film history, I found that doc to be virtually as entertaining as the movie itself - the changing tide in the late 1970's as Star Wars made science fiction the hottest movie genre, the struggle to get Swiss surrealist H. R. Giger on board to design the film, Ridley Scott giving the film the distinct atmosphere that would be constantly imitated later, and so on.

4460730,5,B004RE29T0,"(First I'd like to talk about the way Alien was filmed; It must be a somewhat different technique. I have the Oppo 103 DVD player and the LG PM 6700 Plasma THX 3DTV, and I use Dimensional Optics  Active Shutter glasses. With great anticipation  I put the Blu-ray of Alien in, opted for the Director's cut and hit play. With Ridley Scott talking about Alien being 25 years later, he was in excellent 3D.Then the movie started with no apparent 3D affect. I set the Oppo  to maximum, went into the TV and set its 3D to maximum, and point of view to the maximum plus number. Only then did I get a barely minimal 3D affect.[ I had just watched the 1937 version of, ""The Last of The Mohicans"" in black and white with Randolph Scott. and the 3D affect was almost as good as Avatar, filmed in 3D.] It would be interesting to get feedback from people with other types of 3D TV's).
I think it being the first serious and promoted sci-fi horror movie people didn't know what to expect and had a hard time resolving in what category to place it. The sci-fi crowd were not accustomed to the horror element, and the horror crowd had no idea of what to think of science fiction being a major part of the plot-to the horror crowd if you didn't have vampires, werewolves, demons, devil worship and the Frankenstein monster, you pretty much had nothing. Look at the 1972 ""Kolchak The Night Stalker,"" a made for TV movie that rated a 54, meaning 1/2 the people in the country were watching it and that unheard of record stood for many years.
Yes there were some B movies like you saw as part of a two movie double feature on Saturday,  like ""It The Terror From Beyond Space,"" or ""20 million miles to Earth."" Ray Harryhausen was a very busy special effects man. But nothing special.
(Alien has been out since 1979 so I think its alright to talk about the various exploits of the movie. And I've owned a copy since it first became available on VHS.)
A movie, something very different with a good story and great special effects, a budget, and a director who was not like everybody else, Ridley Scott. He paid attention to details; the scene where they find the seated alien pilot cost 1-million dollars alone ; he said he felt it was that essential in setting up as a clue what was to come and adding to the mystery. The  Ship picks up a transmission and they are required to investigate it. They land and find a ship, enter and find a fossilized pilot In exploring they find a cavern full of pods/eggs and when Kane gets close one opens ejecting a scorpion like creature that wraps around his helmet and he has to be carried back. Ripley says Mother had deciphered part of the message and it appeared to be a warning not a distress signal. She refuses to let them in, but Ash the medical officer opens the door. They can't remove it because it bleeds acid, only to find later it has removed itself from him and its dead.
The biggest surprise of the movie was where they are eating before going back into hypersleep and the chestburster scene where an alien creature comes out Kane's chest spraying everyone with blood, and Ash, ""don't kill it"" (wonder why?) .
Brett and Parker rig up some motion trackers, electric prods, and flame throwers, to go after a creature they are unaware has grown over eight feet. After it kills Brett and takes his body up an air shaft they realize it is huge; Dallas is the next to die in an air shaft. (What works so well to make the movie scary is you only get glimpses of it; you don't really know what it looks like, what makes it vulnerable, or when you might run into it-once the Alien is loose there is a sense of claustrophobia that never leaves. After Dallas is dead Ripley takes over and finds out from Mother that Ash has been ordered by Nostromo's corporate employers to return the creature to their weapon's division-crew expendable.( I always wondered if the company knew of the signal from a probe and had the Nostromo follow a certain course so it would have to investigate.) There is a fight between Ripley and Ash and the remaining crew decapitates Ash, finding him to be an android; Ash's final words are that they will not survive, then they burn him. In the Director's Cut you see in Ash's quarters pornographic pictures taped to the wall and porn magazines. The fact he had them would lead one to suspect it was in his [deviant] programming-he brought them aboard before the Nostromo left Earth. Ridley Scott opened a whole can of worms here.
Parker and Lambert are killed gathering cooling supplies, and Ripley initiates self destruct of the Nostromo. She manages to get aboard the escape pod with her cat Jones, only to find the Alien hidden there. This begs the question, Is the Alien intelligent?
She seals Jones in a chamber, herself in a space suit, seated at the controls she gets the creature out by releasing coolant on it. As it comes out and stands behind her, she opens the door and explosive decompression blows it to the doorway where it grasps each side of the opening. She shoots it with a grappling hook which knocks it out into space. The door closes but the rope from the gun has the creature attached and attempting to crawl into an engine, but she fires them up blasting it free into space. The creature seems to be able to survive in space, but evolved from us and we can't, interesting. On LV 426 where they landed to explore the source of the signal and found all the eggs where was the queen? The pilot was there so long he was fossilized, but the eggs were alive? Was Mother correct that the signal was a warning, and as this was an alien race with no prior contact, how was she able to decipher any of it, and it such a short time? Did the company know something thereby placing an android aboard with a separate agenda than getting the ore to Earth? (Nostromo is Italian for ""our meat,"" I wonder what the joke in that means?)
Alien spawned literally a flood of movies where some creature made physical contact with man then morphed hidden in the
guise of a human. Many did not try anything new, or even being clever, some were so shameless as to have creatures that looked very, very similar. If it is true that copying is the best form of compliment, Ridley Scott sits alone atop a mountain.
I think Alien is one of the two scariest movies ever made, the other being The Exorcist. I rate it ""a two bagger"" (of microwave popcorn.) Just grab the biggest container of your favorite soft drink, sit back, and enjoy.",1382832000,,6472,4.435294117647059

4460734,5,B004RE29T0,"ALIEN (1979):  Still the ALIEN film all others are judged by.

4460735,5,B004RE29T0,"And it still scares!  I love the structure, that takes its time, and builds and builds...

The blu-ray seems to omit a lot of the extras found on the Special Edition DVD, which were most assuredly saved for the bonus disc of the mondo blu-ray edition of all 4 Alien movies, but this blu-ray contains, on one disc, both the original 1979 theatrical release version and the 2003 director's cut, with 2 commentary tracks, one with Ridley Scott, cast and crew, the other with just Ridley Scott, and 2 music-only tracks, with two different versions of Jerry Goldsmith's spine-tingling score, one the final film version, the other the more concert version Jerry originally had in mind.  It's fascinating to hear the differences and how the legendary score evolved!

Curiously absent, in the music-only tracks, are the alternate cues, from Goldsmith's earlier score to Freud, which were used when the face hugger bleeds acid through several of the ship's decks and when Dallas is pursuing the creature in the vent armed with only a flamethrower, and the end of Hanson's Symphony #2-Romantic, which was used for the end when Ripley finally kills the creature and is reprised, in its entireity, for the end credits.  Methinks Fox couldn't secure the rights to those music pieces to include them here.

I tend to favor the 1979 cut of the movie, as it is just a sensual visual pleasure and has the perfect musical rythm in the editing.  Ridley makes a few tweaks, additions and subtractions in his 2003 redux, which expand the story but diminish the tight, kinetic structure of the original version.  Happily, you can pick which one you prefer to watch simply by selecting it from the main menu.",1371772800,4,1685,4.826388888888889
4460736,5,B004RE29T0,"So excited this movie is on blu-ray! One of John Cameron' s greatest, scariest movies of all time, fantastic movie!",1371772800,,115,4.8
4460737,5,B004RE29T0,"Take your pick . . . Sci-Fi Horror or Horror Sci-Fi (I prefer the latter).

Blu-ray transfer is excellent and clean, including the audio which was better than expected from 1979 era cinema audio recording technology. It's obvious the studio's transfer team took care to do it well.

Alien (singular) is the first of the franchise series and viewers must keep in mind it was originally released to theaters in 1979. Pacing starts off about the same as a generic space sci-fi film. It gradually picks up speed with the last 20-30 minutes containing frenetic terror with the relentless and violent ""alien"" creature running amok. Ridley Scott does an excellent job of laying the groundwork and developing characters. It has a couple unexpected twists at the end which I won't spoil here, but a few subtle clues are dropped on the way. First viewers usually miss these when they occur, but they fall into place at the ""reveal."" Ripley effectively uses ""shock cuts"" but doesn't rely heavily on them as many current horror genre do, also employing long takes and building tension. The film relies as much or more on the mental terror as it does visual shock.

Those accustomed to some of the current horror films with non-stop frenzy from the first scene will find the first two-thirds slower paced. Those who can sit back and absorb the story with its development details and sub-plots will enjoy the film as it gradually builds the tension, terror and pace as the true nature and horror of the alien creature is discovered by the characters and fully revealed. IMO this is the best of the ""Alien"" franchise, very closely followed by its sequel ""Aliens"" (plural) which came a whopping seven years later. If you like this film, you'll like it as well. Unlike many sequels, especially delayed that long, it's just as good, starting off where this film ends.",1370995200,,1849,4.8081761006289305
4460738,5,B004RE29T0,"By far the best of the franchise, this movie looks amazing in this remastered edition. I saw this the week it came out (now that was one very quiet and very frightened theater!), and it looks just as good here as then. The dvd looks like crap compared to this. Plus I really enjoy Scott's new edition. No Lucas he, there are very few major changes, but effects issues were cleaned up a bit and only add to the quality of the experience. Ah, a director who respects his fans! How novel.

Not much to say about the film except that it's near perfect. I just watched Aliens and this movie is SO much finer it's hard to believe. Cameron is heavy handed and his cast seems flimsy and fake next to these guys. All the acting here is very good to great, and it all rings true. Ridley moves a camera and composes a shot like no one else, so this is eye candy to the max, as is usual with his films.

Goldsmith's superlative score also sounds sweetly demonic in surround, and the blu-ray has what ALL great scores deserve...an extra with nothing but the music. THANK YOU Ridley! Some of us love a great score and long to hear it without dialogue and sound effects; why more studios don't do this is ludicrous. Maybe because it would point out that music is as important to most films as the script, and that composers deserve money as big as what many overpaid undertalented actors get?

What I really like along with all that is that both commentaries by RS are here, the 1999 version which is all him, and the newer one with the actors, etc. Without a doubt Scott is my favorite commentarist among all directors, completely without bs or posing, just a master craftsman talking about why and how he did things, along with a very wry sense of humor. His comment that operating the camera is the ""best"" job on the set says a ton about him and his total control of the entire process, and why his films have a special sheen and feel that few others achieve once, let alone a dozen times.

Make sure to listen to both of the commentaries, as they're fascinating in so many ways. Would-be directors are given a goldmine of instruction in ace commentaries like this from one of film history's most fascinating directors. The extras also include tons of trivia tracks, deleted scenes and interviews etc, including the fact that Moebius designed some of the costumes and sets, news to me but no surprise as he was the best spacey artist going back then and is still underappreciated. I loved his work along with Corben's back in the early Heavy Metals, and those mags clearly got a lot of inspiration from Scott's early work.

For ten clams this is a crazy bargain, and frankly this and Prometheus are the only two of the series I'd want to own. While Prometheus is nowhere near as tight as Alien, it's a worthy successor/prequel and shows just how far both Ridley and film making have come in 33 years. Yet nothing beats a sharp script and good acting, and even with all the CGI around today, it would be hard to improve very much on this work of weird art. Alien still stands alone among all the late'70s/early '80s post-Star Wars films as the one that delivers sci-fi realism with superb filmmaking...except of course Blade Runner. Ridley's trademark striking lighting and smokey/wet vibe is already in evidence here in Scott's second film, and in some ways it's even more subtle and perfect in Alien.

I'm not much for horror films, but this is more sci-fi/suspense than horror to my eyes and mind, as the frights are more in what we fear than what we see, and as with the Jaws sequels and various others, the less we see of the monster, the more our minds can run wild. And that's the real appeal of this sort of film to me. Add a true master director, and you've got a masterpiece.

And I must add: it's Giger who's the real secret behind this film, and his concepts and art are still ahead of their time. Mind blowing stuff, and it looks so good on blu-ray.",1369267200,2,3949,4.438620689655172
4460739,5,B004RE29T0,"The beauty of this classic monster movie is the fully fleshed out characters that the action happens to, as opposed to characters that are little better than cogs in the machinery of action.  We come to care about these space travelers (well, maybe not Ash).  It matters what happens to them.  This film wouldn't have worked if not for this group of people/actors.  When Veronica Cartwright (Lambert) starts melting down you know they're all in big trouble.  It's a sad crew, thanks to an idiot captain (Tom Skerritt), locked into making one disastrous mistake after another, helped along the way by the duplicitous Ash (Ian Holm, at that time, the most accomplished actor of the lot).
The best lesson learned here was don't go sticking your nose where it doesn't belong (or, fancy eggs don't always mean Easter).

This is, at all times, a fabulous looking movie (Derek Vanlint), with a great creepy-crawly score by Jerry Goldsmith, a good story (Dan O'Bannon), an outrageously well designed alien (H.R. Giger), and a set that still manages to look futuristic after all these decades.

What can I say about this film? Well, for starters it is absolutely brilliant for its time. It was the film that showed you that Sci Fi is not always happy like Star Trek and Star Wars, but is horrifying, thrilling, and chilling to the bone. For 1979 this is as good as it gets. I loved this film, other than the slowness that makes you want to tear your hair out, this was an actually fun and entertaining horror film. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time watching it. I purchased the blu ray at target along with what some consider to be the better of the Alien films Aliens. I will do a review on that some other time. For now lets talk about the blu ray of Alien. The transfer was amazing for a late '70s film. The bonus features were good but could have offered a little more. The bonus features are audio commentaries by Ridley Scott on the original theatrical version and the director's cut. The blu ray also comes with the theatrical version of the film and the 2003 director's cut. I have watched the original version from 1979 but not the 2003 director's cut. The blu ray is a must buy for any Alien film fan who wants to make the upgrade from DVD to Blu Ray or for any one who doesn't want the anthology wth all four Alien films and just wants the singular movie itself with maybe Aliens Too.

Not so with this film which featured Sigourney Weaver in an astounding debut along with a superb cast which included Tom Skerritt, Yaphett Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, and Ian Holm in roles so well defined that one cares what will happen to them which was missing in ""Prometheus"" with the exception of two characters. Also Scott wisely used a political message like Verhoven did in ""RoboCop"" about the individual versus the corporation and what happens when we follow rather than lead.  Another thing that Scott was allow us to know each of these character before the terror begins, slowly building suspense until it's unbearable but I don't mean to disparage his latest effort because despite some flaws it's still heads and tails above what Hollywood nowadays is producing since Noomi Rapace (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Michael Fassbinder (Shame, A Dangerous Method) really redemn the film.

The Alien movies are generally well done, exciting, and well acted, making them standout from others in the genre.

No plot spoilers from me: The crew of a deep space ""towing vessel"" hauling mining ore is awakened from cryogenic sleep ahead of schedule to investigate a signal of unknown origin. The movie creates a great creepy, industrial feel that greatly adds to the realism and suspense. There is fairly good character development, which is actually much better than most movies in the genre. Sigourney Weaver stands out playing Ripley with a very strong performance and the supporting cast is also generally very good. The special effects are good for the time the movie was made and contribute to the believability.

This is one of those movies I can watch whenever it comes on and we occasionally have an ""Alien"" marathon once a year or so where we watch all of the movies in row over a weekend.

Highly Recommended!

4460774,5,B004RE29T0,"The following review is based on Alien on Blu-ray.

Alien is a most difficult film to define. In one sense it's a sci-fi film, in another it's a Gothic horror film. Ridley Scott's vision of the future was so refreshing at the time due to its modest implications. The usual sense of humans as infinitesimal in contrast with their universe is there, as is the feeling that one could be engulfed without incident. But for all its cosmic commonalities; Alien is grounded in a sense of realism. This is indicated by the Nostromo, a space Junker operated by eight ragtag crewman, which is a remnant of heavy industry and mass production that is void of the futuristic sheen of fictionalised ships such as the Enterprise, or the Millennium Falcon. The crew is representative of the working middle-class; a collection of eight crewman whose expertise lies within the most basic provisions of engineering, spare two scientists, these people are the everyday collection that make up our society. Which is why Alien is an exemplary horror film: it deals with ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances - its sci-fi trappings notwithstanding.

Like John Carpenter's minimalist horror film The Thing; Alien is a subtle exercise in tension punctuated by moments of absolute horror. It deals with the venereal and psychological milieu to ratchet up the tension. The Alien is seldom seen, akin to the shark in Jaws, but its presence is always felt. The horror is engendered by its characters rank paranoia, which in turn instils the audience with the same kind of impending dread. The emphasis on the venereal works exceptionally well because it triggers our most basic patterns of instinct and fear. Alien has a distinctly European quality in that it unfolds through the composition of stillness and music. Dialogue is certainly present; however there is an ethereal quality to the proceedings evoking images and sounds that are both chilling and resonant. This is why Alien is such a superior genre film: it takes well established ideas and endeavours into new territory with them.

Ultimately, Alien is a ""B-film"" just as Jaws and the Fly are, but in compounding the formulaic elements with fresh ideas it elevates itself not from its roots, but from people's preconceived views on the genre's limitations. This is particularly apparent in discarding the male-centric heroics in favour of a female lead; Ripley - played with much gusto and poise by Sigourney Weaver. In fact Ridley Scott discards the film's potentially masculine element so curtly and with such cold precision that he can only really be praised for it. As for the creature itself, Scott was loath to consider having his monster being anything other than terrifying. In defining the aesthetics of the Alien, it is best described as an immensely intimidating figure with a phallic head coupled with a retractable secondary mouth that operates like a dagger coated in translucent goo. What's more significant is the form it takes. The alien mutates and evolves much like a virus throughout the film and is all the more horrifying for it. Perhaps this was intentional on Scott's part to contrast the inclining latent paranoia of the characters with the burgeoning development of the Alien. In any event the Nostromo functions as a proxy for fear and instinct. It is key to the film's success.

What makes Alien such a thrilling experience is the sheer sense of terror it invokes, whether it is through the lens of the cosmos, or in the claustrophobic confines of a spaceship. Like all great films, Alien remains a remarkable achievement and cinematic landmark as it engages the senses, without ever resorting to cheap trickery. This is a film made by an artist indebted to his craft; there's never a misstep in this unbearably tense and deeply intelligent film. This is a must own title.

4460776,5,B004RE29T0,"After seeing ""Prometheus"" earlier it seemed appropriate to catch this classic again.  Some of the shots of computer visuals and sounds are quaint, given the technology advances since 1979.  Putting that aside, ""Alien"" holds up as one of the great science fiction/horror films of all time.  It is also director Ridley Scott's earliest masterpiece.

Returning on a routine cargo hauling mission, the 7 man crew of the Nostromo is woken up from hibernation with a directive to investigate a signal coming from a nearby moon. Lead by Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), they investigate and find the remains of a huge humanoid figure at the controls of an unusual space ship.  They also discover a slimy substance oozing from a cluster of pod-like elements.  One attaches to the face plate of the second in command, Kane (John Hurt).

Once back at the ship, efforts to remove the creature are stymied but it soon disappears only to reappear bursting out Kane in the now iconic scene.  The remainder of the film focuses on the crew's efforts to jettison the creature.  Scott takes great pains to inject chair-gripping suspense as the now growing creature remains mostly hidden from view.  As one of the great film characters, Sigourney Weaver catapults to stardom (and 3 sequels) as Ripley, 3rd in command.  After watching this movie countless times, the tension remains even having memorized the scenes.  Truly one of my favorite films.

This film was seen as part of the Blu ray ""Alien Anthology"" collection.  The film has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is transferred in 1080p.  The soundtrack is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The video is an improvement over the DVD, but does retain the grain of the original film.  It is sharp, has appropriate color saturation and hues.  Excellent.  The sound is demo quality.

Science Fiction, Horror, 117 minutes
Directed by Ridley Scott
Starring Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and Tom Skerritt

I first saw Alien during its original theatrical run in 1979 and appreciated it even more on the big screen. The first half of the movie is the best part. It's dark and atmospheric and there is an element of mystery. We are introduced to the crew of the mining ship and learn the relationships and personalities involved.

The computer screens on the ship seem dated now, but the overall effect of the movie is just as powerful. The story gathers pace when some of the crew investigate the surface of a moon and find a ship from an unknown species. The way this sequence unfolds is almost worthy of Hitchcock.

The purpose of the mission isn't immediately clear, but I won't reveal the details in case you haven't seen the movie. This is essentially a story of survival. While an actual encounter with an alien race might involve peaceful interaction, Alien never suggests for a moment that peace is possible. The creature is a killer and pursues the crew one at a time. Eventually, the battle focuses on Ripley (Weaver) and the alien. The second half of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first because most of the mystery is gone, but it's still a gripping story.

Like many movies featuring unknown creatures, we rarely see shots of the whole creature. We are shown glimpses as it evolves and our imagination fills in the gaps. When we are eventually shown the whole thing, it adds to the effect and comes as quite a shock as we realize its strength and resilience.",1330473600,3,1616,4.63986013986014

4460787,5,B004RE29T0,"The 1970's were a time of major change at American movie houses.  Where previously films were marketed to niche audiences, Jaws appeared in theaters in 1975 with a new title attached to it: blockbuster. As Hollywood is always want to do whenever a picture comes out to big numbers, they fast tracked production on copycat films to repeat the success of Jaws. The next big film to change the way Hollywood thinks, though, would be a film that at first no one wanted to finance: Star Wars. Superman would come out in 1978 further cementing Hollywood's changing landscape and approach to films.

Dan O'Bannon came off of working on 1974's Dark Star disappointed with the final result. The Sci-Fi comedy was made for a minimal budget of $60,000, resulting in the mischievous alien of the flick being portrayed by a beach ball. For his next film, O'Bannon worked with Ronald Shusett on what he wanted to be a low budget sci-fi horror film that would allow him to work with a more real looking alien. Inspired by the artistic work of HR Giger he started crafting Star Beast, but decided to retitle it as Alien. Initially no studio wanted the film, but B-movie horror producer Roger Corman was interested. That all changed when Star Wars became a hit and Alien was the only Sci-Fi movie script available and ready.

The Nostromo is a deep space mining ship carrying a crew in hypersleep that is awakened when the ship catches a distress signal on a nearby planet. Per their orders, the mining ship must respond to the signal, so they land on the planet to find a derelict alien space ship. The crew sends Kane (John Hurt) to search the ship, and he finds a cargo bay full of alien eggs. When one of the alien eggs opens Kane is found with an alien organism attached to his face. Now the crew finds themselves in mortal danger, and the whole situation may not be a mere coincidence.

Made for $8.4 million (adjusted for inflation to 2010 dollars that would be equivalent to approximately $24.8 million) Alien holds up remarkably well, and still looks better than some films made for $100-200 million with today's special effects. The claustrophobic feel of the Nostromo's corridors is palpable and lends to the air of suspense that comes from tracking an alien that's tracking you. That's not the only element that's horrific though, the addition of a dubious corporation wanting to capture and study the perfect killing machine at all costs.

Where most directors would have not taken this flick seriously relegating it to B-movie schlock, Ridley Scott was determined to make the finest movie he possibly make. (Robert Aldrich, and early candidate to direct the film, was asked about his plans for the design of the ""facehugger"" in the film. The studio decided not to hire him when he responded: ""We'll put some entrails on the guy's face. It's not as if anyone's going to remember that critter once they've left the theater."") A large part of the success of this film is of course HR Giger's creature design, but also Ridley Scott's unique set designs. His initial design art in preproduction on the film inspired the studio to double the budget from $4.2 million to $8.4 million dollars.

At the time of Alien's release, Sigourney Weaver had not held a lead role, but her role in this film and its subsequent sequels changed the presence of women in action films. She's become an inspiration for many actresses who would go on to take lead roles in action/sci-fi films upping the ante on what women can do. Her brilliance in the role often overshadows the brilliance of the rest of the cast. Much of the dialogue by everyone is improvised throughout the film, and the infamous chestburster scene (one of the scariest moments in film history) was done in one take reactions and all. Ian Holm also has heavy lifting as Ash who has to walk a thin line between portraying human to the fellow characters and in reality being a droid working for the corporation that wants the alien.

Alien is one of those rare perfect films. The horror is palpable, and it consistently builds suspense. The titular alien is perfectly shot throughout the film; never do we see too much of him as he's always covered in shadows or filmed close up allowing us to never get a good look at him adding to his ominous presence. Everyone gives brilliant performances that allow the audience to empathize with them, and the script leaves no holes in logic or plot. This film is a masterpiece of science fiction and horror. If you haven't seen it then go out and pick it up right now, if you have it's time that you watched it again!

4460789,5,B004RE29T0,"This Review is for the Blu Ray Single Disc Version of ALIEN.

I wasn't going to buy this release, for fear that my DVD Special Edition version was just as good. When I saw this on sale for $9.99 I took a chance and bought it anyways. I am so glad I did. The studio has remastered the film just for blu-ray. The results are amazing. ITs like watching a totally new movie. I also have the sequel ALIENS and the results there are just as good! I think both ALIEN and ALIENS are must own BLU-RAYS! It really shows what can happen when old movies are remastered correctly for HD Blu-Ray.

There are really not any special features on the blu-ray, as far as special features you are better off keeping disc 2 of the ALIEN Special Edition DVD.

What you do get on the BLU-RAY is perfect picture and sound for the 1979 and 2003 releases...!

If you are on the fence about whether this is an upgrade to the DVD release, don't hesitate, go out and get this and the sequel ALIENS..You will not be disappointed! You will notice things in this movie that have never really noticed in the DVD Version.",1323129600,7,1087,4.287804878048781

4460791,5,B004RE29T0,"For those with no real need for behind-the-scenes stuff, the Blu-Ray for the first Alien movie is a good choice.

You get two (very slightly different) versions of the movie, and two commentaries (both of them good). You also get --for the first time since the 1999 DVD (remember that?)-- one-and-a-half isolated scores. (More on this later)

So many people go on about how the second film (Aliens) is the best of the series. I suppose propeller-heads *would* gravitate towards that one, but ""ALIEN"" remains the true classic. Visual effects, sound design, set design, ensemble cast, tight storyline, perfect editing and pacing, snappy dialogue, the most iconic design for an extra-terrestrial organism and alien setting Ever, and one of the greatest music scores of all time. It just might be the Only Thinking Person's Horror Film of any kind in the last 50 years. The pace is slow, but leisurely and suspenseful. You get to know this realistic crew and their very convincing spaceship. No false notes there. Then they explore a strange new world (courtesy of H R Giger) that ""Trek"" and ""Wars"" never would have touched. Following one of the benchmark shock scenes is one of the most relentless chase/hunt stories of all time, with a healthy dose of conspiracy (Very 70s) thrown in for good measure.

Seriously, if you took any large group of serious film or SF or Alien fans and had them watch ""ALIEN"" and ""Aliens"" over a weekend, most of them would likely concede that ""ALIEN"" was the better film, in so many ways.

About the isolated scores -- I'm not sure, but judging by the cue lists, this May Not be as complete as the '99 DVD version was. I suspect that there might be some kind of super-weird copyright issues involving the 1962 movie ""Freud."" (The producers put cues from the earlier film in ""ALIEN,"" a decision that irritated Jerry Goldsmith to no end.) Despite this, the '99 DVD *seems* to have all of the 1.5 scores intact, thus remaining the most complete soundtrack of ""ALIEN"" in existence. Otherwise, I have the 2007 Intrada ""ALIEN"" soundtrack and Varese Sarabande's 2009 (limited) ""Deluxe Edition"" ""Freud"" soundtrack as covering 99.2% of ""ALIEN"" 's score(s).  As for how much of the soundtrack is on the Blu-Ray, I don't' know yet. Therefore, any fan of the ""ALIEN"" soundtrack might want to hang on to their '99 DVD and check/compare before ditching the DVD.",1319932800,,2375,4.825552825552825
4460792,5,B004RE29T0,"I waited for ""Alien"" to come out as an inexpensive single Blu-ray, and it finally has. Based on a classic low-budget programmer, ""It! the Terror from Beyond Space"", ""Alien"" is a near-perfect horror film of the ""ten little Indians"" genre. Having both the original and the 2003 version is a bonus; I slightly prefer the latter. The sound is excellent, and I found myself really appreciating Jerry Goldsmith's simple but effective score.

I'm starting to think Fox and Disney have the best transfers. Here, again, there is no grain reduction and no (visible) edge enhancement.

4460795,1,B004RE29T0,"Question: What good is the color Teal? What great work of art has ever had a predominate Teal cast? What great photo? Do they even make Teal filters for cameras?
The answer is a resounding no.
And more importantly, did Ridley Scott use a Teal filter when he photographed the movie Alien? Once again: The answer is a resounding no!
So why would the morons who remastered this warm, rich, amber film drain all the life blood out of it and convert it to a bleak, cool greenish blue vomit color?
Currently there is a group of idiots in Hollywood who are taking warm, rich, amber films and draining all the life out of them with the accursed never before existing Teal filter.
I was so shocked and angered by this transfer that I immediately got out my Alien 20th Anniversary Edition DVD and popped it in for a direct comparison.
It is night and day. The DVD has less resolution sure, but its colors and contrast are vastly, let me repeat, vastly superior to the new Blu-Ray of Alien.
Let me make this clear: LV-426 was an Orange/Brown planet not a sickly vomit colored Teal planet.
Do not under any circumstances stand for this type of abortion of a director's work. Has Ridley Scott ever made any film that was not warm, rich and amber?
I mean come on, this is his trade mark.
I give this film only one star because it is one of the greatest films of Sci-Fi, but this transfer is the worst possible transfer of a film ever besides Fellowship if the Ring which was also a victim of Teal and Aliens that went from being a  predominantly electric blue film to being a sickly vomit colored Teal.

4460797,3,B004RE29T0,"I was expecting quite a bit more from this release and while I can understand Fox's preference for consumers to buy the whole Alien Anthology package which costs a lot more and hence translates to higher revenue for them I think it is also wrong to penalise the fan who is only interested in one or a couple of the installments.  If it is a matter of disc space then I can understand why there are no Special Feature documentaries on the making of the movie are on this as having both the 1979 Theatrical and the 2003 Director's Cut on the same disc is great although I wouldn't have minded something similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-Extended-Director-s-Cut-Original-Theatrical-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B001992NW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] where we get a nice digibook plus 2 discs with the different versions on each disc plus great Special Feature extras.  I still think as far as blu-ray releases go that this one is the best I've seen so far in regards to being as perfect a blu-ray release to satisfy the fan that I've seen to date.

Also, for some reason my disc keeps skipping and stopping at key points making me suspect I got a bum disc as so far no one else has complained about it.  When my disc was working correctly though, I thought the picture quality was very good and so was the THX DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround Sound quality as well.  Having watched both versions I personally preferred the 2003 Director's Cut as it speeded things up a little to suit modern tastes and despite the addition of new scenes still ran at about the same length as the 1979 version.  Truth be told though I thought both versions were very good.  I liked the homage Ridley Scott clearly paid to one of my all time favourite films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-Blu-ray/dp/B000Q66J1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>] and it certainly had a very Stanley Kubrick feel about it.  The theme of greedy big corporations putting profits ahead of human life seeking to implement weapons of mass destruction is sadly still relevant today whether it is biological as it is here or financial as in real life.  Can Corporate Social Responsibility really be embedded into the culture of powerful corporations or is it just a construct to keep us happy while the boards of directors laugh at us behind their closed-door meetings?

Overall, this release was a mixed bag for me as it could have been a lot better and not just an afterthought when compared to the complete anthology version.  Even the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Blu-ray/dp/B00319ECGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix [Blu-ray</a>] release was decent for those who didn't want to get the entire trilogy.  Instead I get the feeling I'm being punished by Fox for not getting the entire Anthology with a pretty pitiful release of ""Alien"" on blu-ray.

The quality of the BD, both visually and sound wise, is incredible. I was speechless as I watched the opening scenes of the Nostromo, the camera panning around its narrow corridors with every line and texture clearly visible. The sequence in the cryo-sleep room, showing the crew waking up from their slumber is as clear as a bell. I found myself saying out loud (I was alone), ""1979...unbelievable..."" I suppose it's only fitting. Alien was far ahead of its time when it came out, so it makes sense that the BD version surpass expectations.

The BR has both the Theatrical Release & the Directors Cut on one disc. You can check out both, but I agree with Ridley Scott's description from the DVD set (although @ the beginning of the DC he now says it differently): the original is better than the Director's Cut. Scott was actually pushed to make the second version so the studio would have something ""New"" to release, the first version was actually what he wanted & it flows better. You don't mess with perfection.

The strange thing on the packaging is that the case states the format as 2.35 & 116 minutes (correct), but the cardboard sleeve has it as 1.85 & 137 minutes. Plus the sleeve says this is from 1986 when the actual versions were 1979 & 2003, so I have no idea where that came from (unless it's a typo). I throw out those sleeves, so it won't matter for me any more.

If you like sci-fi/horror & haven't seen this, get it. If you have the DVD, the BR is much better, but I never had any complaints on the DVD and the DVD has more extras.

8439001,5,B004RE29T0,"Most of the intellectual film community cites ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as the greatest science fiction film of all time. Film critics take notice: I think the original ""Alien"" surpasses ""2001"" as the best science fiction film to date. That's not to say there aren't other films worthy of golden rocket ship trophies aside from ""Alien"" and ""2001"", such as the original 1977 ""Star Wars"" (aka ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope""), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", and ""Blade Runner"". Probably the first aspect which pushes ""Alien"" passed many other films, is how it slowly brings us into a ""universe"" without being self-conscious about it, somewhat similar to the first space sequence of ""2001"". To be fair, ""2001"" did pave the way for films like ""Alien"" and ""Star Wars"". The scope of the story, again somewhat similar to ""2001"" is very confined: a space ship which has a brief encounter on a planet and what is brought on-board.

First we encounter a cargo vessel, the Nostromo, bound for Earth carrying millions of tons of iron ore. The vessel seems to be moving slowly through space. We then are shown the inner corridors of the ship. The corridors are all silent, which is very different than the opening to the original Star Wars in which a small ship is being pursued by an imperial star-ship larger than a supernova. Here, we see the ship's empty corridors and for a moment wonder if anyone is actually on-board. We even see a room with a large computer. Suddenly, the computer and ship ""come to life"", lights flashing. But no passenger appears responsible for this end to the long silence.

Then we see seven sleeping passengers whose glass lids are opened. We deduce that one of the ways space travel is accomplished in this ""universe"" is to put the passengers to sleep, which probably solves the problem of life support and food. Passengers are put into extended hibernation for long periods during travel and are awakened at arrival. Now the hibernation compartments have been opened. The first passenger to awake looking groggy and spent is Kane (John Hurt) who moves slowly out of his sleeping bay. The other passengers follow.

Finally, the passengers finally awakened, they learn they are not home yet. Why were the passengers awakened before completing the voyage? Dallas the captain (Tom Skerritt) has consulted with the super-computer which runs the ship, affectionately nicknamed ""Mother"" who has awakened them because it received a signal from another planet. We learn it was programmed to awaken the passengers if certain situations arise and in this case, the signal was one of those scenarios. They are also compelled in their contract to investigate such a signal, or their shares, the money promised them, will be revoked.

Several of the crew board a shuttle craft and land on the planet where they find an ancient ship. The ship was designed for beings many times the size of the human crew. The corridors of this ship are much more ominous than that of the cargo ship, almost like a giant abandoned city. A fossilized corpse of a large creature many times bigger than an average human being seems fused to a large chair. Kane finds a strange holding area where large oval-shaped objects, about the half the height of a person, are spread about. Kane examines one of them which seems to come alive and attack him. The landing party returns but Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) declines to let Kane in until he's gone through 24 hours of decontamination. The science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets them inside, contradicting Ripley's orders.

A strange parasitic organism is attached to Kane's face, and it has ultra defenses to prevent it from being removed from Kane. When Dallas and Ash try to remove it, its tale wraps tightly around its host. When they try to cut into it, it spews acid. This turns out to be the first part of a three-part encounter with something alien, interpreted both as a noun and an adjective. Aside from the action sequences, the reasons for the original signal, the awakening of the crew, the investigation and the presence of the thing itself all have political implications.

""Alien"" is not just a classic science fiction story but a masterpiece of genre filmmaking. The pace and tone of the film are gradual but deliberate. At nearly every moment, the crew, who are simply a bunch of working class stiffs, never fully understand what they're dealing with. When finally the entire scope of their situation is revealed, it's almost too late.",1509840000,,4480,4.842036553524804

I aged a few years and that cat lost two or three of its 9 lives.,1502496000,,288,3.661290322580645

Starting from the clever menu screens,  you can tell some care,  creativity and respect has gone into making this disc.
Both the original 1979 original theatrical cut and the later director's cut are offered here. (Which is better?  Oh no,  leave me out of that debate. Decide for yourself)
What is here is gorgeous transfer,  a variety of audio options,  delightfully black blacks, moments in sound that will have you picking the shards of your woofers off your carpet if your not careful , and an overall attention to detail that makes you glad to be a blu-ray owner in the first place.
Reference quality?  Meh. Not quite. But you won't be disappointed.  In short:  GET IT.",1499472000,5,801,4.5
