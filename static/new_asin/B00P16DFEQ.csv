6780864,5,B00P16DFEQ,You get a great double feature of Robin Williams. Moscow on the Hudson is one of my favorite movies. Robin brings out a great performance as a Russian musician who defects to the USA. There is drama and comedy in this film. Jakob the Liar is a very emotional and dramatic movie. Robin is extraordinary in his portrayal of a Jewish man trying to lift the spirits of his friends in the Nazi occupied ghetto. You can't beat this deal!,1436659200,6,431,4.4
