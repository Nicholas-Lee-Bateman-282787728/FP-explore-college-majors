7133001,4,B00WKZO3CO,"Once again, Europe has shown the US that you can use kids in violent movies without calling it child abuse. Cub is more of a psychological horror film rather than straight up slash and stab kill kill kill. You are never given the answer as where Kai came from. Is he real or is he a manifestation of all the hurt that has been heaped upon Sam. As with all good movies, the viewer is left wanting to know more. And as with all good thrillers, the viewer is left wondering if the end is really the end.  Although not a cerebral a movie as Let The Right One In, Cub goes to show that Europe, especially the Germanic speaking portion, knows how to show kids who are multi-dimensioned and not just cute or precocious know-it-alls.",1440720000,4,725,4.330882352941177

7133003,5,B00WKZO3CO,"A refreshing little love letter composed from an obvious horror fan to the rest of us, Cub expertly mashes together Lord of the Flies-like drama, survivalist thriller, and nostalgic late 70s/early 80s slasher into one (surprisingly) taut, cohesive whole. The solid acting, cinematography, gore, and slight social commentary perfectly fit this simple yet compelling story of bullying and social ostracization. There is not a moment of fat in the film, and we couldn't take our eyes from it. As this is a fairly gory pic involving violence to (and at the hands of) young kids (and animals), some viewers may shirk, considering the concept taboo. But thats one of horrors many opportunities: to show us in graphic detail what we know happens in the world but which we refuse to speak of aloud. In the end, Cub is a horror movie for horror lovers, not unlike We Are Still Here, Youre Next, or House of the Devil. And for genre fans, it absolutely delivers in every way.",1440633600,7,965,4.7844311377245505
7133004,5,B00WKZO3CO,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I absolutely love horror films that have kids in them.  Not teens, but kids, from the age 12 and down.  Why, you might ask?  Because this makes the terror and the tension in a horror movie even more palpable.  Maybe this stems from me being a parentbut when kids are involved, my anxiety level skyrockets.  For this reason, I knew I wanted to check out CUB the minute I saw its press release.  And Im sure glad I gave it a look, too.  The film is a unique and impressive horror flick that deserves your attention.

This is the first Flemish horror film, from what I understandand its a heck of a debut.  The movie takes hold of you from the start and never lets go.  It is well made, and I will wager the horror community will be hearing much more of director Jonas Govaerts in the future.

CUB is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production team does a great job of capturing the desolate wilderness in which the events take place.  This feeling of isolation dramatically increases the suspense, as we (the audience) truly believe these scouts have nowhere to go.

The acting is great, too.  I am particularly impressed with Maurice Luijten, who portrays the main character, Sam.  Luijten does an excellent job with this role, and I hope to see more of him in the future.

The story in CUB is pretty straightforward, with the only vague aspect being the motive behind the killings.  But its the execution of the film that wins me over here.  Chocked full of mystery and intensity, this is one movie I will definitely revisit in the near future.

CUB is a major win for me, and I suggest checking it out soon.  It is available now in a variety of formats, but try to give it a look on Blu-ray; youll appreciate the HD picture and sound.",1440460800,8,1817,4.393393393393393

What a huge disappointment. Shouldn't a horror movie actually be scary? This movie fails on all fronts. The characters are moronic and unbearable.  I don't know what kind of parent would let their child go anywhere with these two idiotic scout leaders. Many ridiculous situations go unanswered. How does the killer have electricity in the middle of the woods? The killer and his kid just sit around in their dungeon waiting for the someone to wander out in the middle of nowhere so they can kill them. And finally a sickeningly vicious and unnecessarily drawn out killing of a dog (which probably goes a long way toward seeing what's in the mind of the individual that made this crap). Maybe the creators of this movie should get strung up in a sack. I'd certainly like to whack them with a stick for creating this piece of crap.

7133031,5,B00WKZO3CO,"As some others have pointed out, there are a LOT of questions that one has about the story and very few are answered by the end.  That is what makes this movie rather unique;  It does not wrap things up nicely.  I think this is why a lot of people in the U.S. will not ""get"" or like this movie.  Which is too bad - overall this is a pretty good horror movie - not gory - which is a relief.

Some of the questions I had/have were not answered either - like why not more on Sam's back story?  Why didn't they include the two deleted scenes in the movie?  I thought that it would have helped the narrative - but it seems someone at the movie company didn't think so.

Others have complained about the dog being killed and how long the scene was.  And how uncomfortable it made them.  If it did that, then I think it accomplished the task - to make you uncomfortable.  Here is another thing I noticed - some of those same people didn't feel the same way about the demise of the people.  Hmmmmmm.  : )

Yes - I recommend this movie for more of what it isn't than what it is.  It isn't your typical ""horror"" movie that uses gore to replace storyline; that pulls punches so as to not make the audience uncomfortable (there's that word again); that doesn't make you sit up and go ""huh?""; that explains and wraps everything up by the end.  Nope - not your typical movie at all.  That is why I like and recommend it.",1443916800,,1406,4.129151291512915

7133036,2,B00WKZO3CO,"Truly disappointing.

I was looking forward to this movie since it's inception. Unfortunately, Cub (or ""Welp"") simply does not deliver on what it promised.

From the music to Sam's isolation, everything begins well enough, but shortly after introducing the killer (known only to the film's director as ""The Poacher""), the movie begins losing footing. While the initial booby traps and alarm rigs are quite cool and intimidating, Cub ultimately takes WAY too long getting to the meat of its story. I dug Sam's victimization and storyline and the single neat-o kill early on, but again, by the time the movie FINALLY gets to the actual carnage, mayhem and action, it drops the ball.

Spoilers ahead.

This is a movie about cub scouts utilizing their skills to survive against Kai (the dog-boy) and The Poacher's traps. Even the director stated that he took the ""no killing kids rule"" as a challenge... And then nearly NOTHING is done with this. Once everything goes to hell for the kids and they discover what they're up against, THAT'S IT. There's literally only a single scene of three of the kids working together that lasts all but twenty seconds. And the other kids? Oh, well, they're all killed in ONE FELL SWOOP by The Poacher simply by driving through their tent via a cut-away.

Even promotional imagery depicted the children working together with camping equipment to fend off The Poacher's advances, but none of that actually happens. None of the cub scout characteristic are used at all. Even the two children that assist Sam (in that twenty second scene) simply disappear after this moment.

From here, the movie only has another character biting it before a single final confrontation between boy and villain and then a ""twist"" (a pretty obvious one).

Really, the ONLY standout scene of violence is performed on a poor, defenseless animal. This scene is the ONLY moment of ""action"" that is prolonged and rather uncomfortable--everything else is just shot quickly and in rather drab ways. While story-wise, this scene makes sense, I find it strange that, in a film with SO MUCH POTENTIAL (regarding the traps, The Poacher's lair, Sam having to fight back, etc.), that THIS is the scene the director sought to focus time on. Not the cool stuff, but the dog-torture.

Instead of utilizing ANY of what makes Cub a cool idea, the director only displayed snippets, instead vying for an off-paced slasher that fails to deliver the goods. I'm sorry, but only having about ten minutes of ""slashing"" in a near two-hour long movie is just not right, especially when 90% of the cast are wiped out in one of the most basic and visually drab sequences.

Cub could have been amazing had effort been placed into the last act to make it memorable, to actually utilize the traps beyond one or two ""eh"" gags. How great would have been if it followed through with the initial premise, marketing and synopsis? How groovy would it have been to see a brutal cat-and-mouse game occur between the hunter and the rest of the scouts? One-by-one falling to his vicious traps as they try to find a means of using their cub scout skills against him? How cool would it have been for the children to become lost in his bus-labyrinth and contend with Kai chasing them through each section as he tries to thrown them all in ""the pit""?

Unfortunately, those questions will never be reality. As it is, Cub is by the numbers, plays it safe and beyond one or two potentially cool set pieces is just forgettable. Truly disappointing considering it could have been a benchmark for new horror.",1442620800,3,3565,4.800978792822186

7133041,4,B00WKZO3CO,"Watching foreign horror movies is always a treat. The quality of the films may not match those of the more mainstream American movies at times, but more often than not non-American horror take risks that Hollywood execs tend to shy away from.

Welp (known as Cub in English speaking countries) is fun and fast paced slasher-in-the-woods from Belgium and the directorial debut of Jonas Govaerts. The story follows Sam, a twelve year old who joins his cub scout group for a camping trip into the woods. Little do they know the location chosen for their adventure is a hunting ground. A hunting ground for what you ask? To tell would ruin the surprise.

The movie is tightly written and well filmed. The setting is genuinely gorgeous and used wisely through the story. Welp is a slasher film but has very heavy elements of survival horror similar to those in Wrong Turn, Eden Lake, and The Hills Have Eyes.

What I give the movie a lot of credit for is not shying away from dealing with some significantly sensitive violence but managing to do so without going over the top. Govaerts handles two specific scenes (one involving a dog, the other a number of kids and pick-up truck) very well and although there may be some aversion from certain audiences to appreciating the content, it works without being gross-out or shock-and-awe.

The last item of praise I have for this film is the soundtrack. Written by Steven Moore, the sounds and background score are excellent. Without knowing his exact influences Ill just say that I heard John Carpenter through the entire movie. Strong, direct synthesizers with deep beats, stripped down to the bone. Nothing flashy. Just tonally perfect music for a horror film of this kind.

My primary criticism of the film is the third act. The reveal works and Govaerts does a nice job of bringing the film full circle, yet it felt there was something missing in the set-up. Paying close attention will give you enough info to buy off on the finale but just barely. Moreover, the final battle (of sorts) is a bit longer than necessary and the audience must accept a few standard horror tropes just because.

Overall Welp is a strong addition to the horror family. Well paced, well acted and bloody enough the slake the thirst of most horror fans. Jonas Govaerts has done a fine job on his first outing and it will be interesting to see what he comes out with next.",1441324800,3,2394,4.688095238095238

There are a few interesting plot twists and and ending that still has me a little confused.

I feel like i didn't get the optimal experience because I didn't find out what they said for four or five seconds and in conversations, it doesn't mention who said what. It may seem like five seconds is a minor thing, but it can be confusing to have to piece the movie together with the delay. I can't speak to the DVD or Blu-ray versions, but the On-Demand version has this flaw. If the subtitles were better synced with the audio, it would probably be a 5 star film for me.
