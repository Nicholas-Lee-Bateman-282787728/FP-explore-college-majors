8594925,1,B00DNJ986C,"Angelica (Joanne Verbos) has mental issues. She is placed in a home where a murder/suicide took place and she sees ghosts.

That is about it. We spend the bulk of the film watching Angelica do normal things like walk, small talk, brush her teeth, straiten the Last Supper picture, vacuum, jog, shower, sleep, brush her teeth and straiten the picture again. We have glimpses of the ghosts who start to interact with her. About 12 minutes from the end, things pick up.

The film is slow and boring. It is extreme low budget and was shot in some guy's house. How do I know it was a guy? Because in one scene there is a speaker mounted above the door in her bedroom corner with a wire running through the top of the door opening. What woman would do that? The speaker is missing from subsequent scenes.  But Angelica is more concerned about straitening a picture, then a disappearing speaker. There are scenes which are pitch black. Some have breathing in them, some have annoying piano music. Sound track was pretty bad too.

Worthy of a punch on the hacker card.  No sex or nudity...shower scene from shoulder up. No swearing, although to be honest I had my thumb on the FF quite a bit.",1412294400,2,1184,4.488372093023256
