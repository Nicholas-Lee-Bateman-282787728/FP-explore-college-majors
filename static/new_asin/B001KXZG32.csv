8316476,5,B001KXZG32,"Mahoro is a retired combat android. She has a little over a year left in her operational life span. She decides to spend it helping people. She takes a job as a live in maid for a middle school boy named Suguru. She quickly works her way into his heart with her devotion and pure intentions. They become very close and overcome many challenges. A sexy teacher who has her eye on Suguru is always trying to split them up, an old enemy returns to settle the score with Mahoro, and Mahoro's impending fate weighs heavy on her heart. Despite these trials, their bond remains strong. Thye may be able to overcome any challenge together, but what will happen when her life span comes to an end?

This is a great anime. It is very similar to Steel Angel Kurumi. It also has a bit of a Love Hina, and Girls Bravo mood about it. I personally like it better than Kurumi, and Love Hina. The animation is pretty good, there are lots of great characters. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also very decent. My favorite part about this show is the many different genres it spans. There is action, comedy, drama, and romance. This show has a very sweet love story going on, but there is also a lot of nudity and pervy stuff thrown in there. This show has everything. I can't believe that I just found out about it by accident. It's over 10 years old. I'm very glad I discovered Maharomatic. I think any mature anime fan can find something to love here.",1353196800,,1440,4.373134328358209
8316477,4,B001KXZG32,"This anime is good but it could've been funnier/better. It's issues are that it could've had a lot more funny moments, and at the end of most of the eps. it always states that Mahoro will stop functioning within a certain number of days; this is not a good idea to put because it would upset the viewers of this anime as well as destroy the great series as a whole. I really don't care for movies or shows that have the main character(s) die at the end. This does not satisfy viewers, it upsets them. Plus there's no reason why Mahoro should die, if she does there won't be anymore seasons of the show. Anyway this anime is good despite its flaws, its worth checking out. 8/10",1285113600,,676,4.2890625
8316478,5,B001KXZG32,"Well...
Other than the fact that it came out in January and you can't get it near where I live.

The series has so far been great, but I've only watched 5 episodes.

There's great fan-service, and the plot is Excellent. I didn't get it at amazon, but it was the same price. I really recommend this.",1234137600,,298,4.2105263157894735
