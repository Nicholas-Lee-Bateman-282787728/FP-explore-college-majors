8701797,4,B00THX0SLC,"Love the thematic, and there's some good episodes here. But it automatically loses a star for including the wrong Diff'rent Strokes episode; It should be the one where the creepy bike shop owner almost molests Arnold and Dudley. It's one of the most memorable episodes of the series!",1424131200,8,283,4.916666666666667
