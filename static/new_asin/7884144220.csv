This is one of My childhood's favorite - I think I have seen it on Austrian TV channel in German first (I think it was ORF2).
This was even a quest for Me finding the correct title.
The region coding (Region6) saddens Me though - I still do not understand, why I cannot by a copy without region coding (RegionAll) at all or a copy in My own region (Region2)! I would have paid for it!",1431993600,,487,4.083333333333333
7900126,5,7884144220,"As a child my family would constantly rent this on VHS from our local library. The  library eventually got rid of it, and we had forgotten what the title was for years until just recently searching for it. Upon watching it for the first time on DVD we immediately noticed an improved picture and sound quality. Also the VHS was dubbed over rather than the subtitle option in this one. While I enjoy the subtitles, there was something comical about the dubbed version that I will miss, although it's most likely nostalgia than anything else.",1378166400,,540,4.684210526315789
