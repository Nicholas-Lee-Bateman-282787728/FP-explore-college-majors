8527462,4,B008FYZIRS,"This DVD is divided in two sections. The first section is with Alain Formaggio and the second section is with Moshe Galisko. I found this DVD very useful. I have a few of Formaggios  Krav Maga  DVD's.  I gave it 4 stars because I believe Formaggios techniques were more practical and useable.  The only downside I had was with Galisko's knife defences. I'm sure there was a couple of occasion's where he literally grabs the blade or very close to it. Which in real terms means ripping your hand open, especially if it happens to be a double edged blade or is even serrated. I would not care how desperate the situation was there's always another way as Formaggio shows.  Galisko, shows other techniques which are practical but some were questionable as mentioned in an other review. All in all it is a good DVD and I would still recommend it as you can still learn from it, just use your own common sense especially with Galiskos section.",1427068800,,938,4.559523809523809
8527463,3,B008FYZIRS,"Good basic knife defenses using the ""control weapon limb and strike"" protocol.

Filmed outdoors and in a situational format that makes it a little more realistic
in terms of actual environments and more interesting to watch.

Neither instructor speaks English so the entire dvd is narrated in English.

Most of the defenses are simple and practical with only a few being questionable.

I would recommend this instructional dvd.",1350950400,,427,5.235294117647059
