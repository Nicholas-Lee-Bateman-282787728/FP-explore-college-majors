5312565,5,B009B82EZ6,"There is now a full review, this transfer is infact the japanese universal studios transfer and looks great.

[...]

Just a little heads up on the Bluray release for folks that want to know ""something"", the masters done by Geneon - universal  for the Japanese Blurays might be the single best looking blurays ive ever seen (you can see finger prints on the cells and dust and scratches). It's really clear that being pioneers first restoration Tenchi received a lavish-vanity- remaster, MSRP in Japan for these 4 Blurays was over $600, complain all you like, it's just what the remaster for this niche product has to cost to cover production. If the Funimation does 1-to-1 disk copies of the Japanese blurays, anything under $100 is totally stealing and consider yourself lucky. However Funi usually gets a crappy deal from the Japanese studios so who knows if the integrity of the Japanese masters will carry over to the USA release.",1350864000,4,934,4.861635220125786
5312566,5,B009B82EZ6,"Finally after all these years Tenchi Muyo is getting a new release. Some of you may remember the very limited DVD collection that ran under Pioneer for a ungodly price, and even fewer of you remember the VHS set. Back when you payed $20 a tape and it only had 1 episode on it! I am glad I can finally retire my old VHS collection of Tenchi and now have every series of Tenchi release in the US other then Tokyo (which was a abomination).

5312671,3,B009B82EZ6,"This series can be funny sometimes, like when Ayeka and Ryoko try to win Tenchi's heart by imitating what they read in manga, but unfortunately, it's also creepy to the point of questionable legality in the US. The 4th episode contains uncensored full frontal nudity and is extremely NSFW. Ryoko's aggressive pursuits of Tenchi can get very disturbing, especially since Tenchi is a HIGH SCHOOL BOY being pursued by an over 700 year old woman. This was gradually toned down as the franchise went on, but this is the earliest OVAs where it was at it's worst.

Anyone who, like me, originally saw this on Cartoon Network needs to be warned about objectionable content in the uncensored version and here it is (incidentally, this is the series that was called ""Tenchi Muyo!"" on Toonami)",1396224000,,782,4.835820895522388

5312744,5,B009B82EZ6,"""Tenchi Muyou!"" (which translates to ""Useless Tenchi!"") was one of the first anime series to be released in home video in America and one of the first anime series to introduce Americans to English dubbing and for LaserDisc owners, a series that was known for its quality for being releasing in CAV format but also one of the most expensive home video releases on LD at $39.99 per episode.

From its popular 6-episode OVA series known as ""Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki"" (1992-1994), which was released in 1992 followed by seven more OVA episodes from 1994-2003, an expanded television series focus on the first six OVA's were released titled ""Tenchi Universe"", the series was a retelling of the OVA series, debuted on Japanese television in April 1995 through September 1995. And would air in the United States via the Cartoon Network in 2000. And three films ""Tenchi the Movie: Tenchi Muyo in Love"", ""Tenchi the Movie 2: The Daughter of Darkness"" and ""Tenchi Forever! The Movie"" would be released in theaters.

Originally released by Pioneer/Geneon several times in VHS/LD and DVD format, with the license of ""Tenchi Muyo!"" now moving to FUNimation, the company will be re-releasing the OVA's, the movies and ""Tenchi Universe"" television series on DVD, while the OVA series and movies will be released on Blu-ray for the very first time.

""Tenchi Muyo!: OVA Collection"" will include the first 13 OVA episodes released between 1992-1995 and for those who owned the previous Japanese Blu-ray release, this is the same release from Japan from 1999 but now includes the English dub soundtrack.  The Blu-ray release will also include the DVD's and a limited edition was released with an art book.

The original ""Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki"" OVA's revolve around a teenager named Tenchi Masaki, who lives with his father and grandfather.  As the three are visiting the family shrine near the mountains of Okayama and Tenshi going through training from his grandfather, Tenchi has been warned to not enter the forbidden cave near the shrine.  A cave that has been locked for many years and is said to hold a demon which was sealed, alongside a sword that had defeated it.

But being the curious teenager that he is, Tenchi decides to open the cave with his grandfather's keys and he finds the legendary sword, but is now rusted and Tenchi thinks its a sword of no use.  But when he swings the sword on a rock, the rock splits into two.  But by slicing the rock, he had exposed a secret passage and the further he goes into the cave, he finds the mummified remains of a demon.  As the demon tries to reach out to him, the sword glows and shoots out a beam of light.

Back at school the following day, he finds out that the demon, who introduces herself as Ryoko, explains to Tenchi that she had been locked in the cave for 700 years thanks to Yosho.  And now she wants the sword and tries to get it back from Tenchi.  But just when Tenchi thinks he has gotten away from the demon, while going to bed asleep, he finds out that she is under his covers.

Meanwhile, in space, Princess Ayeka and her sister Princess Sasami (along with their guardians Azaka and Kamidake) are in a spaceship looking for her long lost half-brother Yosho.  All she knows is that Yosho went to chase after Ryoko, a wanted criminal who attacked Jurai 700 years ago.  So, when Princess Ayeka goes to Earth, she is shocked to not find Yosho with the sword but a teenager named Tenshi Masaki.  What happened to Yosho? And why is this Tenchi with the demon Ryoko?

This leads to Ryoko trying to finish off the duty that Yosho left of pursuing Ryoko and in the process, ends up wrecking her ship.  Now, Princess Ayeka and Sasami have no choice but to live with Tenchi and his family, along with Ryoko.

Can Princess Ayeka live with the Masaki family and get along with Ryoko?  Will she find a way back home?

Meanwhile, a clumsy Space Ranger named Mihoshi Kuramitsu is investigating strange occurrences on the planet Earth and a new evil named Kagato plans his attack in hopes to acquire Ryoko and also Princess Ayeka in his hopes to find out the power of Tsunami.

While the first half of the series revolved around Tenchi meeting his new houseguests, the second half of the OVA series would feature storylines that revolved around relationships with Tenchi and the other characters, the growing rivalry for Tenchi between Ryoko and Aeka, exploration on the connection between Sasami and Tsunami and also a visit by the Royal Jurai family to the planet Earth.

VIDEO:

""Tenchi Muyo!: OVA Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition. It's important to first emphasize that this is old-school anime. The animation was utilizing cel-work and you can see the sketched in strokes of the characters.  But for an older series, this is the best I have ever seen of this series.

Back in the early '90s, ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was what a lot of us measured anime quality with, when it came to anime on LD.  ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was one of the first series to use CAV format and literally use up all the LD space for one episode and was useful for anime fans to grab screen images that looked fantastic for its time.

But having watched this series on VHS, LD, DVD and now Blu-ray, the Blu-ray really brings out the colors and detail of the series.  I was very pleased with the HD presentation.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the audio, ""Tenchi Muyo!: OVA Collection"" is presented in Japanese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and English Dolby TrueHD 2.0.  The Japanese soundtrack interestingly enough has the better dynamic range, better use of the surround channels over its English counterpart (typically, its the other way around).

While I will always love the Japanese voice acting for ""Tenchi Muyo!"", back when this series was released, it was during a time where a lot of people including myself, debated about Japanese vs. English dubbing. Back in the mid-90s, many of us were heavily pro-Japanese voice acting because many anime that did try to include English dubs were terrible. Suffice to say, I appreciate of how English dubbing has evolved for American releases but back then, I really couldn't stand it. But I did have exceptions and that was for the OVA series.

First, let me just say that for the Japanese soundtrack, ""Tenchi Muyo!"" had one of the most talented seiyuu cast in Japan.  Ai Orikasa, Masami Kikuchi, Yumi Takada and Chisa Yokoyama were fantastic! I  was pretty much raised on the Japanese soundtrack but as Pioneer back then would also release hybrid LD's with the Japanese version on one side and the English dub on the other-side of an LD (or release them separately on VHS), I actually got used to listening to Kermit Miller, Celeste Burch, Kristen Tanner and Katie Ashley.  It was one of the few instances where I did not object to the English dub as much during that time and actually enjoyed it.

But overall soundtrack is good and clear.  Of course, one should not expect anything too immersive, considering the age of this OVA.  But dialogue is clear and understandable and action sequences sound good in stereo.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Tenchi Muyo!: OVA Collection"" comes with the following special features:

  ""Episode 13 Omake - Here Comes Jurai Part Two - (7:15) A special omake episode that would lead to the third OVA series (which would be released in 2003).
  U.S. Trailer - U.S. Trailer for ""Tenchi Muyo!""
  Trailers - Trailers for FUNimation releases

JUDGMENT CALL:

The old school way to watch ""Tenchi Muyo!"" back in the early '90s.

I can remember being young and watching ""Tenchi Muyo!"", the OVA series for the first time with a local anime club.

I was mesmerized by the series, its quality and as anime fan, knowing that the series was going to be released on LaserDisc for the very first time, suffice to say, it was the first anime series that I would spend my hard-earned money on.  Off to an electronic store known as ""The Good Guys"", where I purchased my first LD player, my first television set and my first ""Tenchi Muyo"" OVA LD at Tower Records, I had saved a lot of money just to make this purchase and sure enough, I found myself growing up with this series.

From OVA, film, TV series, ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was a big part of my life and here we are today, with ""Tenchi Muyo!"" now being released on Blu-ray.

The first thing that came to my mind is how fortunate anime fans are to get this series as one collection, in HD for a fantastic price.  Back in the early '90s, one OVA episode of ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was $39.99 on LD and I believe it was $29.99 for one episode on VHS.

Sure, that was the sign of the times when it came to anime releases but I can't help but feel that today's anime fans are fortunate to get these 13 episodes for a great price!

And while there have been many versions of the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" universe featured as TV series, the first 13-episodes would be my favorite because of its storyline, its artwork and the voice acting was fantastic.  Instead of being a banal anime harem series, there was a lot more creativity when it came to writing for the characters.  In fact, too many harem anime series try to focus on the action and fan service with less focus on the story these days, while ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was all about the story that integrated a storyline of characters who cared about the male protagonist and featured action, but it was not the most important part of the series.

While this OVA series has been reviewed many times in the past, what I'll focus on is the quality on Blu-ray.  Colors are much more vibrant, detail is more apparent and the series looks much better when it comes to the character design and backgrounds.  Yes, it's old school anime that utilizes cell work but by no means does this series look very soft or aged, the series looks great on Blu-ray and comparing to the LD release, the Blu-ray blows it away.

Also, you get a lossless Japanese soundtrack.  Considering that back then, the series was released in stereo, the fact that you can hear birds chirping all around you, or even a telephone ring showing up on each channel was pretty cool to hear.  But the Japanese lossless soundtrack gets the advantage in this Blu-ray release, while you do get the original Pioneer English dub included as well in Dolby TrueHD 2.0.  As for special features, you do get the ""Here Comes Jurai Part 2 but it would have been nice to have the special episodes included as well, such as ""Mihoshi Special"" or even the ""Pretty Sammy"" specials, as I don't know if those will ever be released again on video.

Overall, ""Tenchi Muyo!: OVA Collection"" is for the fans of old-school anime series from the early '90s and fans who grew up watching the series and now want the best version of it in HD!  Sure, part of the allure of the original OVA series was it being one of the first anime OVA series to be released in LD and also among the first to be shown at anime clubs and earlier anime conventions, but it's also one of the best anime series of its time that would go on to spawn off other television series that other anime fans may be familiar with.  Still, this original OVA series is still my favorite of the many ""Tenchi Muyo!"" anime releases and one that will always be closest to my heart, as I grew up watching it.

5312749,5,B009B82EZ6,"Ever since I was young, around 12 years old or so, I would come home from school every day to watch Toonami on Cartoon Network. My favorite anime was Tenchi Muyo. I instantly fell in love with the series and it was the series that introduced me to anime. At the time, I was too young to work and earn money so when I was finally able to work and have the money, the old box sets of the original Tenchi Muyo: OVA was incredibly expensive!!! I always prayed that someone would release a new set (in BluRay format to boot!) that was a decent price.

Finally, after about 10 years, I have gotten what I wished for! Even though it's only 12 episodes and doesn't have the most recent episodes of the OVAs (titled Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-Ohki that was released around 2005ish or so), this is worth it. It's the best episodes in my opinion, of the entire series.

It's nice to have the Blu-Ray and standard DVD discs and also have the beautiful artbook come with it. I'm  very pleased with my purchase. Would highly recommend it to anyone that was a fan of Tenchi Muyo. You will not be let down or disappointed. I promise. :)",1361059200,2,1110,4.301435406698564

5312754,4,B009B82EZ6,"When I saw that Tenchi was being released in bluray format, I squealed with excitement.  Being a Tenchi fan for many years, this was something I had to pick up.

Since almost every other review goes over the story line and what not, I'm only going to go over to product itself (Which I'm pretty sure is the point of these reviews)

The dvd/blue rays come in their own cases, but both are come inside a hard cover box set.  There are 3 dvds and thus, there is a plastic arm like device that one of the disks sits in. The bracket for this device is very cheap and very weak. When I received mine, it was broken.

There are only 2 bluray disks, so this device was not needed for them.

The menu is very..different. They use the same trailer that funimation used to promote the bluray collection, as the menus backdrop. Same music, same video. The music, being something completely unrelated to the Tenchi series.

Extras are next to non existent.

Overall, the picture quality is great and in my opinion, a huge improvement over the older dvd quality sets. This is worth the purchase for the image quality alone.

One thing to be noted, others have also stated that this is only the first 2 Ovas, This is true. Though most fans agree that the 3rd ova was an abomination and like to consider the series end with episode 13, the fact that there is indeed another OVA out there, is something to be aware of.

As a big Tenchi fan, I reccomend this on the blurays superior image quality alone. Though I wish that they added more extras or special features. (The Movie Collection comes with a little art book)",1359849600,2,1600,4.41156462585034
5312755,3,B009B82EZ6,"First and foremost, This is a nice release from Funimation, the transfer is great ( Unlike the Serial Experiment lain mess) and the packaging is nice.

My main gripe is with this release is  the extras, it pales in comparison to the  older Pioneer dvd box set.  In the previous Pioneer dvd set, they had the Tenchi Encyclopedia (V.3) which was packed with extras.

The Tenchi Encyclopedia included:

The Personal Files,  which included  interactive background information from all of the characters from all the series, as well as video clips of them, in addtion to that it included slides of each character as well.

The Visual records, which included commercials from  Tenchi Muyo in Love, Tenchi Muyo, Tenchi in Tokyo, and Ryo Ohki.  Also included, were  video promos to Tench Muyo, and Tenchi Universe, and digital comics. It also includes a nice interview with Mayumi Iizuka, which was the voice of Sakuya. I also includes two music videos of Mayumi Iizuka.  Finally, it included teaser video clips to Tenchi Muyo in Love, and Daughter of Darkness movie.

The Geographical data ( my favorite)  included interactive sketches from Masaki House from every floor level.

The Secret files, which included video teasers from Tenchi Forever, and rare pencil tests from Tenchi Muyo in Love II (Which was never made I believe.) And more, which I didn't list.

So, the Pioneer dvd release was truly a premium release, and if you own that release, you should keep it.  However, the blu- ray has superior upgraded video and you should grab that one as well.",1359676800,2,1550,4.873563218390805

5312758,5,B009B82EZ6,I was completely shocked at the release of this blu ray/dvd combo. I had attended San Japan where funimation has a big presence and there was no word on this release on there upcoming releases reel. As for the packaging it's top quality. The artwork is great. Video quality is amazing for a show as old as this. If you're a Techi fan buy it no questions asked. I must add that there is nudity in the show so for people that aren't aware or new to the series or even offended by it just a fair warning.,1359417600,2,501,4.122448979591836

5312760,3,B009B82EZ6,"I've never seen that Japanese Blu-ray transfer so I can't compare, but this transfer is more than acceptable.  It's a show from '92/'93 that was shot on cells and transferred to film, either 16mm or 35mm.  If it was shot on 16mm this transfer is fantastic, if 35mm then like I said its more than acceptable.  Whether 16 or 35 what this generally means is that there are materials for a proper HD transfer and not an upscale.  The backgrounds look as clear and crisp as any other.  But also be ready for a few soft scenes and scratches that are inherent with the cells and film that this series was shot with, it's unfair to compare them with today's HD digital shows.

The HD transfer on this releases is clearly better than any of the other equivalent DVD releases, but don't get rid of them just yet.  As for bonuses we get a 16 page booklet, trailers, and a sort of short clip show for a handful of minutes.  Disappointing when it compares to previous DVD editions, so like I said, don't grow the old sets out.",1358812800,3,1013,4.351063829787234

I started watching it at 12 years old and fell in love. Almost 10 years later I am still in love and they just now release it. The quality is great, behind the scenes stuff and extras are spot on, and it's in Blu-Ray. My only complaint was that it came thru UPS and they botched the order up. But if you watched any Tenchi Muyo this collection is worth the investment. It's likely we will never see the powers at be re-release this series again, so get it by yesterday.",1358035200,,638,4.2809917355371905
5312774,4,B009B82EZ6,"I believe this is one of the earlier unwanted harem comedies, and it's a great space opera adventure, to boot.

Tenchi Masaki spends his summers at his grandfather's shrine, learning an ancient, presumably Japanese sword art,.His life changes when he finally successfully enters the shrine's ""forbidden area"", accidentally releasing the ""demon"" said to have been imprisoned there by his ancestor, Yosho. This is the start of a grand adventure during which he discovers the true origins of his grandfather's art, the extent of his own powers, and the lengths to which four beautiful, powerful, and at times dangerous women will go to secure his affections.

It's a great show, and I'm really glad they finally re-released it; it was very difficult to find for many years, and I'm glad I finally have the opportunity to own my own copy.

My only complaint is the subtitles. I would have preferred if, rather than simply transferring the old material to new DVD and Blu-Ray disks, they had had someone re-translate the subtitles. The current subtitles have problems stemming from the translation practices of the time, the biggest problem being the erasure of honorifics. In most cases, this is okay, except when the choice of honorifics becomes a plot point--Washu's insistance on being referred to as ""Washu-chan"" being the most painfully awkward translation. The English has her say ""little Washu"", which is fine for a dub (if even more painfully awkward), but inexcusable in the subtitles in an era when most anime fans are expected to have some familiarity with the use of honorifics.

But still, great series, and far better than the adaptations that followed.",1358035200,8,1663,5.08058608058608

5312776,5,B009B82EZ6,"This being my favorite series between Tenchi Muyo, Universe and Tokyo (and the only one I didn't have on DVD) - I decided to take a chance and order this. The price is not bad considering it is a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.

The sound quality is amazing. You can hear the voices crystal clear, the beautiful background music is vivid and the sound effects are booming. I'm currently watching the Blu-ray version, with the episodes automatically set to have the English voiceovers (a nice attribute for anyone who's owned Japanime discs and has constantly had to switched to English). However, the intro and ending credits are in Japanese writing.

The picture quality is standard. Perhaps the picture wasn't completely remastered in case it took away from the beautiful art? You'll notice the quality is the same when it was aired on Toonami. There are key scenes that you can tell you're actually watching a Blu-Ray edition (Tenchi running to the cave before he releases the 'demon', Ayeka's ship heading towards earth, etc).  I'm watching the series on my small 32"" flat screen television, and the picture does not completely take up my screen - having two black bars on both sides of the picture (which seems to be the worst feature). Basically, the Blu-Ray edition makes it capable of watching this series on any high definition television.

Now I never owned the OVA Series on DVD - I did continuously watch it's run on Toonami and owned the VHS versions, it seems like there are additional scenes added that answer some unknown questions (Ex. - Why Tenchi was on the school rooftop before Ryoko attacked, and why Tenchi's father was on the grass when Ryoko had to shrink the house) and some redone dialogue/new voices as well (The conversation between Tenchi and his friend about spending the summer with Mummys is completely redone, and Ryoko bragging about protecting Tenchi in the ship crash is much longer). The series also has much more sexual dialogue.

Overall 8/10. A wonderful collection for a great price, and a must for Tenchi fans old and new - and a great gift for any Japanime fanatic.",1356998400,,2101,4.808864265927978

5312778,4,B009B82EZ6,"Tenchi Muyo is one of my favorite shows and one of the best animes. No need going into what makes this show special because if you like it, you love it and if you don't like it well you aren't even reading this. This release should have been what fans have been waiting for.  Tenchis first time on blu-ray is however somewhat disappointing.  The transfers aren't much better than a SD upconvert and they might even be given FUNimations track record. It is the best the show has ever looked on a US release; the colors can be quite vibrant and some scenes feature very good detail.  There are scenes that are very soft though, even keeping in mind the age of the OVAs. Overall it's hard to find any serious gripes with the video.  As for supplements, there is only one special feature included.  Just a short 7 minute slideshow-of sorts.  I was let down with this and the Tenchi Movie collection, which also features less than stellar transfers and no special features save for some trailers. It's pretty clear this isn't much more than a cash grab.  Even with the reduced price it's hard to fully recommend this, especially since part of the cost are the DVDs that you are forced to buy. If it's your first Tenchi purchase you will likely love it.  For myself and others that have waited patiently for Tenchi on Blu-ray you will likely be quite disappointed.  This should have been the 'definitive' Tenchi release for the fans, with loads of special features, but it's not.",1356307200,34,1473,4.570342205323194
5312779,5,B009B82EZ6,"Anyone having heard of `Tenchi' would already know what it's about, or would have read elsewhere the basic story. The only thing I have to say to add about this undeniably classic title is that this was historically one of the first harem series ever created, and even today it stands out as something special from the genre. In fact, the OVA was created before the harem genre even became a genre--they were just creating a sci-fi comedy/action show with an over-the-top romantic comedy element to it. Because of that, even amongst other recent harem titles, the girls stand out as having far more living character to them and you just genuinely care about this cast than you would in similar recent shows. Plus, if you have an appreciation for the classics, and/or if you like titles that are weird, inventive, imaginative, funny, and just plain fun, 'Tenchi' is definitely from that spectrum.

Otherwise, the title of my review basically sums it up. As a forewarning, if you already have the Pioneer releases, and if you especially care about special features, you're better off keeping them. The only downside to Fuminations' blu-ray release is that it's as bare-bones as they come--no production sketches, no trailers (except for the third movie, oddly enough, I guess they weren't able to get all materials), no interview with Christopher Franke (the phenomenal composer of the first movie), not even creditless OP/ED which is even more odd. But if you're a `Tenchi' fan, and you have a blu-ray player, you're doing yourself a favor double-dipping on this. If you're new to the `Tenchi' saga, this is the best time to start checking out this title (just know that two of the movies are actually sequels to the TV series and not the OVA, while `Daughter of Darkness' is a branch from the OVA continuity). Both the OVA and Movie sets come in good-looking, rigid artboxes with art mini-booklets as companion items. The classic OVA itself (that is, precluding the third season which could've been a lot better) has never looked more beautiful in its existence, and the equally great movies have been attuned to look even more cinematic than they ever were.

To sum up, all I have to say is--Thank you, Funimation, thank you so much for caring enough about us fans for this special collector's release! `Tenchi' fans old and new, you owe yourself to get this!",1356307200,,2360,4.839108910891089

8539225,5,B009B82EZ6,"Tenchi Muyo has probably one of the most diverse legacies in all of anime. Originally a 6-episode OVA series, followed by a special(which became Episode #7), then continued in another 6.25-episode series, it left a trail for several TV and movie remakes, along with a spinoff set further in the future, until finally being officially continued in a third installment of the original OVA about 12 years later. This is was also the foundation of what would become the ""harem anime"" genre. Picking up the concept that Urusei Yatsura, Tenchi Muyo takes the boy-meets-alien-girl concept and ramps it up with even more hot extra-terrestrial babes!

Tenchi Misaki is an average teenager spending the summer working at his grandfather's temple where he unintentionally releases an ancient demon, who turns out to be the sexy space pirate Ryoko sealed away in a tomb by Tenchi's ancestor. Fortunately, Tenchi has a handy lightsaber which is really the key to an alien empire known as Jurai, whose princesses Ayeka and Sasami come to Earth looking for their half-brother Yosho. Later, the bubbleheaded space police girl Mihoshi drops in, just before the intergalactic criminal Kagato invades looking for the secret to Jurai's power. Kagato was keeping his old teacher Washu(and Ryoko's mom!)prisoner, that escapes and helps Tenchi defeat their shared enemy. All five girls eventually move into Tenchi's home with his father near their grandpa's temple. This portion of the OVA was continued in the 2nd series with more background on Washu, and the Jurai royal family. The 3rd OVA takes place sometime afterwards, which gave Tenchi even more love interests, and leading into how the universe was created, despite the fact that there's some added plotlines that pointlessly tags more loopholes to the series, making most of the last two episodes as exposition fests. This and the tacked on time travel factors make it so that most of the first parts of the 3rd OVA are completely re-enacted, plus an odd take on the Evangelion finale.

The OVA is being continued in a 4th series, hopefully having Tenchi finally picking one of the multiple girls from his harem as his one true love. Tenchi Muyo was most heralded in America as part of Toonami's lineup, even though it was profoundly edited, and was broadcast with the Tenchi Universe and Tenchi In Tokyo TV remakes. It's spinoff, Tenchi Muyo GXP(the title character of which only shows up in one episode!), also played on Toonami. The multiple magical girl parody remake starring Sasami called Pretty Sammy has also had it's own OVA series, and two TV remakes. Another mini-TV series titled Ai Tenchi Muyo shows an older Tenchi as a teacher, although its considered to be a sequel to Tenchi Universe. Aside from the Mihoshi Special, the only other anime directly tied to the first Tenchi timeline is War On Geminar dealing with Tenchi's younger brother on another planet, as well as a slight tie-in to the Dual: Parallel Adventure TV series which has some connection to GXP. The original OVA series also spawned a manga series released in America as No Need For Tenchi, as well as an American-created 6-issue Tenchi Muyo comic book series which was really a sequel to Tenchi Universe. If you have trouble shifting through all these various spinoffs, sequels, reboots, and remakes, it might be best just to stick to the primary OVA series, and any of its various official continuations.",1502064000,,3423,4.992994746059544
