8708554,5,B00UW1H3A2,"I bought this film as a huge fan of Emilio Rivera. It was a tough watch, especially seeing him as this type bad character. Definitely an awareness story on human trafficking. Sad situations. Pray.",1467244800,2,196,4.794117647058823
8708555,1,B00UW1H3A2,"I don't even know where or how to start. This entire movie was a hot mess. Clearly anyone who gave it good ratings is either part of the cast or related to them. The quality of the film would make you think it was filmed and produced by high schoolers in a video production class. The acting is so awful you can't help but laugh. Worst of all the movie is supposed to shine light on the horrors of human trafficking yet, instead,  glorifies rape and sadomy. Even the characters in the film who are not sold as sex slaves are sexualized. This movie is disgusting.",1448582400,,562,4.30188679245283
8708556,1,B00UW1H3A2,"This movie is so horrible.  The other reviews must have been written by employees or friends of the film crew.  That's the only way to explain how someone could give this 5 stars.  I bought it because I really like Emilio Rivera, but he couldn't save this.  For starters, the pair that were supposed to be young or teenagers look like they're about 30.  The kidnapping victim doesn't seem to be all that upset about being kidnapped, raped, and held in a brothel.  She actually seems to just go along with it all.  But that's normal-none of the other kidnapped and abused girls seem to mind as they lounge around the pool and laugh while guards hold guns on them. There is one point where she gets upset and shouts at the Bad Guy-and it's to protest how he treats his farm workers.  Again-no objection to the whole kidnapping and brothel part. Her relationships with the others are just as absurd.  Then there is the fact that there are supposedly girls going missing and no one cares until it's a cops kid.  Seriously-it is hard to go into the details of how bad this is because every bit of it is bad.  Just save your money.",1445126400,,1125,4.412621359223301
8708557,1,B00UW1H3A2,"I had low expectations for this but It had good reviews. But this is the worst movie I have ever seen; and I'll watch anything. These reviews must be from friends and family because there is no way in hell anyone would actually enjoy this movie. It was hilariously awful. The storyline jumped around, totally lacking fluidity and very disjointed. I'm just shocked that this found its way into red box. There's a scene in which these characters are talking to each other via iPhone call, the phone is in view while they talk but the phones are on home screen not call in progress screen. Hilarious! I'm really just shocked. Totally baffled.",1443398400,,639,4.663716814159292
8708558,5,B00UW1H3A2,"This movie is very moving and very powerful. The way they show you what really happens in sex trafficking. Emilio Rivera (Sons of Anarchy), John Amos (Good Times), Vida Guerra (Eye Candy), Tai Carlton, Angela Pinner, even child actress Peyten Hernandez and director KC Amos all come together to show you what really goes down in Sex Trafficking. Now in this movie,  in my opinion, child actress Peyten Hernandez, actress Angela Pinner, actor and comedian Tai Carlton, and actor John Amos all played their roles perfectly. I loved this movie.",1432252800,5,541,5.011111111111111
8708559,5,B00UW1H3A2,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this film, but once I started watching it I couldn't stop. It felt like a real story, and all the characters seem so real, I had no idea these kinds of things are happening to our young girls. Excellent performances by Emilio Rivera (Sons of Anarchy), and John Amos (Coming To America), and Vida Guerra committed so naturally portraying the role of Tracy, that she somehow makes you forget your watching a movie. Excellent film and very original concept with great actors. Hoping that Amazon puts out more independent movies like Mercy For Angels.",1432252800,2,593,4.711538461538462
8708560,4,B00UW1H3A2,"This bold film superseded my expectations! I was scared. I cried. I
hung in suspense throughout the entire film. The soul grabbing ending
brought it all home for me. Tough subject matter to take on but this is
a story that NEEDS telling. Performances by all are commendable. John
Amos is stellar! This artful film making approach is quite exquisite -
so fresh and new! Two thumbs up!",1432080000,2,383,4.647058823529412
8708561,3,B00UW1H3A2,"Kim Stahlworth (Nicola Bertram) is a 43 year old detective who is desired by members of both sexes half her age. Her daughter Tracy (eye candy Vida Guerra) likes to smoke crack and allow young homeless men to come home and take a shower. Mom, who is so eighties, disapproves of her daughter's behavior, driving her to wander the street as a homeless waif until she is picked up by the white van.

The van is controlled by a rich man who picks up homeless girls, you know all those homeless babes who look like movie stars, to pick, eat, or fertilize strawberries and there seems to be this prostitution thing developed near the end. The irony and theme of the film is that everyone knows homeless people were being abducted, but the cops didn't care enough, or gave it a wink and a nod. Now that a detective's daughter is endangered, it becomes a problem, a statement on how homeless people don't matter.

The film starts off pretty good, but has scenes that go nowhere such as the cops dressing up as the homeless. They really didn't know what to do with Tracy as a captive and the the scenes were awkward. Kim, searching for Tracy lacked cohesion as she deals with a mean boss and a woman colleague who wants to help in all sorts of ways. It seems like the cut important scenes.

Guide: F-bomb. Rape. Nudity (brief FF) 2 1/2 stars",1431734400,,1332,4.428571428571429
