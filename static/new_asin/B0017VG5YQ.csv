8267501,4,B0017VG5YQ,"Do Hazaar Ek ( Case No. 2001) is a crime thriller that will keep you guessing. At first, it is very obvious who has committed the murders, yet as the movie goes, it becomes less obvious.

Jackie Shroff is impeccable as the gentlemanly family man, who doubles as an experienced cop, and he's matched perfectly with a woman his own age this time (!!) Dimple Kapadia. All the criminals are appropriately slimy and/or detestable.

Rajat Bedi is a bit of a show-off, but a good contrast between his rambunctious youth and the reserved Shroff. The final scene, however, was a bit too much, with Rajat, without his shirt, throwing grenades and killing bad guys... was that a movie or a big advertisement for this guy?? Anyhow, great movie.",1376870400,,732,4.7109375
