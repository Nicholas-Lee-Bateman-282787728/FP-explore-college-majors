1365366,5,B00004WICK,"A wonderful film of a wonderful People with the Who-is-Who of Native American legends of actors. Gorgeous Michael Greyes! He is the perfect choice as Crazy Horse showing his sensibility, courage and brightness. If it where not for the battle scenes, that are featured bigger in movies, this film would easily fit to hold a candle to many other great movies. And I can understand that he is a hero to much oft the Native Americans.
And it is SO typical that this extraordinary film ist not out on DVD only now, and only in Germany, while You have no trouble getting Tonto and other poor stuff. Are those, deciding on these things, still afraid oft that man? Its disgusting, that all the German Winnetou crap was dubbed and can be bought in the US on Blue Ray, while You can not (yet) get this one on DVD. But since in Germany films are in English and German you may order it there. amazon . de

1365367,3,B00004WICK,"I happen to be a fan of Michael Greyeyes in television and film  (He was in We Shall Remain one evening most recently in a starring role on PBS).  His acting here is fine; somehow this film fell short of what I'd hoped for.  I think much of that may have been the film's soundtrack.  It sounds like a cheap television series soundtrack.  It did nothing to enhance the action taking place on the screen, and that did bother me.  Everyone's acting was fine, and I felt the pacing was fine.  I just HATED the music!",1247184000,,512,4.270833333333333
1365368,4,B00004WICK,"The vision quest of Crazy Horse as a young man shows us that the culture of these plains Indians wasn't primitive. In the 300 years since the Spanish brought horses to the new world,
they had changed and adapted their hunting culture to the horse.
That Indians ever won a battle with American regular troops
who had modern weapons and military training,
shows that the Indian generals like Crazy Horse could learn and adapt.
I think that this side of American history needs to be told and retold
as it points to the treaty breaking political nature of our culture
that in many ways mimiced the British Empire in India
in the double dealings with the people of the lands taken.
The slaughter of the Indians and the shipping of the young to schools
shattered these cultures completely.
It is pretty much a cultural eminent domain story...",1230076800,6,836,4.6938775510204085
1365369,5,B00004WICK,"This is a really great movie and by far the truest of all movies that I've seen for the Custer battle. Crazy Horse is my hero and I still study a great deal of him and the Lakota/Sioux tribe.
  I have watched this movie many times and always enjoy watching it, I have also read the book by Sandoz of Crazy Horse. They both are very similar to all the battles, life and trials of Crazy Horse. I wish I could of rode along side of Crazy Horse during these battles.
  I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants the clearest knowledge of what really happened. I have finally found this movie with Amazon.com's help, and I am a proud owner to own this movie even though the price of it was a little much.
  I think it is highly worth every cent, and I hope everyone that buy's this movie and or has seen it enjoys this movie as much as I have myself.
  History is a virtue and this event was inevitable, What happen to Custer, he deserved! And it wasn't in anyway fair what happen to Crazy Horse, but history has played it's part here and can't be replaced. I respect that this film was made carefully, especially at the time Custer was shot the first and second time killing him, because no one knows for sure whom it was that killed Custer, but Crazy Horse was blamed, and Crazy Horse paid the price for Custer's death along with the USA's Calvery. Like I said, they deserved what they got and thats the way life goes.
  Michael Greyeyes as well as Wes Studi played excellent roles for Crazy Horse and Red Cloud, Along with all the other characters that played their parts as Spotted Tail, Sitting Bull, Black Shall, Black Buffalo Woman, Little Big Man, as well as Custer too.
  Great movie and a must see !!

1365370,2,B00004WICK,"Didn't like this one. Glad to see Native actors/actresses, but  this portrayal of Crazy Horse way off the mark as far as I was  concerned. Maybe not quite as bad as the first one--Chief Crazy Horse (from the 50s with Victor Mature), but not much better either. Too much Hollywood here--lots of paint horses and feathers.

1365371,5,B00004WICK,"A wonderfull movie! Attention to detail, for example some of the statements made by Crazy Horse and Custer, period costume and battles. It is interesting to note that Custer had cut his hair before the battle of the Little Big Horn, which appears to be the only movie to portray this accurately. Custer dies somewhere during the battle and not in the 'classic' back to back end of the battle senario as is popularly portrayed in the 'hero' literature.
Red Cloud and Spotted Tail are portrayed in a rather negative light. I am not convinced that this is accurate. Sitting Bull hardly gets a mention although it is a fact that he was the major role player at the time.
I will watch this film again and again",978048000,27,705,4.515625
1365372,5,B00004WICK,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who's interested in Native American History.  This is much more interesting than the basic biography format, which is much to rigid.  This movie depicts the humane side which portrays Crazy Horse not only as a Sioux Warrior, but as a man of great intellect, thought, and wisdom.  Although, his life was short and tragic, he remains forever, a legend immortalized.",970099200,15,402,4.970149253731344

7925429,5,B00004WICK,I love this movie about Crazy Horse because it is the closest to reality than any other. There are a few scenes that were incorrect such as the Fetterman fight that actually took place in December with deep snow on the ground. The quotes are accurate as well as the context of the Native American lifestyle such as Black Shawl's hair being cut after the death of her daughter. It is a rare glimpse into the the journey of this Oglala leader who lived his life for the sake of his people and to preserve the Lakota way of life at all costs. The worst drawback of any about this video is that I could not find it on DVD anywhere.,1379289600,3,627,4.190082644628099
7925430,5,B00004WICK,"This is another wonderful film which deserve to be released on DVD soon. Crazy Horse, the strange Man of the Oglala,
is one of the memorable performances of Michael Greyeyes and should not be forgotten. Anybody out there???",1372550400,5,223,4.894736842105263

7925432,4,B00004WICK,"Being a fan of Michael Greyeyes this movie was filled with eye candy!!! The story of Crazy Horse is romantic and mystical. He was the last of his tribe to surrender to the government. He was a warrior who devoted his life to his people and was willing to give it for his people time and time again, but survived many attempts at his life. This movie has a lot of action and the scenery of the Black Hills is breathtaking. I only wish it was available on DVD. I had to dust off the old VHS to watch it!",1362355200,9,501,4.02

I was especially happy with the really fast delivery time, and the seller was responsive to any questions, I would have no problems dealing with this seller again in the future.

7925435,5,B00004WICK,"If you have a Native American film collection, this is essential. Only criticism is that Crazy Horse is an English translation of the Lakota name (better would be Horses Have Spirit). There is a much older film with Victor Mature (1950s) which is more distorted, and, of course, has whites playing lead native characters. Bravo to Michael Greyeyes's performance, other actors, and writers.",1310342400,,389,5.190476190476191
