1832615,5,B00008AORL,This is a wonderful detective series and is a prelude to the Inspector Lewis detective series which starts after Inspector Morse series ends.  See them both!,1383264000,,157,5.038461538461538
1832616,5,B00008AORL,"In Dead on Time, Morse is confronted with The Woman, who left him when he was a student at Oxford. He fell apart afterward and lost his place in the world, but she married a Don and lived happily for many years until her husband became immobile due to a degenerative disease. In this episode, the Don seemingly commits suicide  prior to becoming completely incapacitated- or did he do it? Morse tries to solve the case, but his love for The Woman blinds him to the truth.  Morse and Lewis are at their most heartfelt. Superb and mature.

In Cherubim and Seraphim, Morse's sixteen year old niece commits suicide and Morse is plunged into the youth culture of the 1990's which includes raves and ecstasy. Very good.

Death of the Self gives us Michael Kitchen as a reformed conman who conducts seminars into self knowledge for the unhappy rich in Italy . But after a murder on the course, suspicions are raised. Morse isn't buying into his conversion and has the help of a beautiful and gifted opera singer as he and Lewis go on location to Italy to solve the case. Gorgeous settings abound.

A triple murder occurs in Happy Families, a story of a most  unhappy family and their blighted inheritance. Excellent performance from Anna Massey as the mother and the young Rupert Graves as an odious reporter who gives Morse a great deal of grief over the case.",1382572800,3,1354,4.597510373443983
1832617,5,B00008AORL,"This is another one of those great Morse stories. I only wish there were more of them.  John Thaw and Kevin Whately are just perfect, as is Anna Massey (Raymond Massey's daughter).
A must see for all Morse fans.",1376956800,,211,4.410256410256411
1832618,3,B00008AORL,"This installment is an atypical Morse.  It is a straight ""who done it?"" which is quite good for that genre.  Being completely void of the personal side of Morse and thus depriving us of our much anticipated diversions, we look to the paparazzi, who are covering the detective as opposed to the investigation, believing Morse will make better copy - but alas we are not privy to the published articles.  The paparazzi - and there are many of them due to the prominence of the family involved - become quite an annoyance for Morse as does Superintendent Holdsby replacing our regular Superintendent Strange, who is on vacation.  One murder follows another; however the persistent Morse -- after disposing of some ""red herrings,"" finds the thread that ties them together.  My first viewing of this entry resulted in three stars -- subsequent viewing and reflection, led me to increase the rating to four stars.  It is quite a good episode after all.",1171497600,6,946,4.84472049689441
1832619,5,B00008AORL,"This entry is excellent, especially since the key factors which identify the villain do not emerge until very late in the mystery.  Absence of virtue could easily describe this mystery, as most of the principals in this story have significantly flawed characters and/or dark secrets.  Morse's tendency not to suffer fools gladly is prominently displayed, as illustrated by his relationship with journalists who focus unusual attention upon him while covering multiple murders in the same wealthly family.  Morse is also confronted with dealing with a temporary Chief Superintendant while his own boss is on vacation. The frustration level of Morse is palpable as he is faced with a vexing case, intrusive journalists, and a less than empathetic supervisor.  In the end, however, the cerebral approach of Inspector Morse is vindicated.  One thematic element which makes this story satisfying is that to one degree or another, all of the culprits get what they deserve.",1086220800,18,967,5.294117647058823

Also available is the series called Endeavour, which depicts young Morse when he was a sergeant. In this series, he has recently left an Oxford college and knows the classics, but did not finish.",1423440000,,394,4.549295774647887
1832706,5,B00008AORL,"If you are new to ""Inspector Morse"", then you are in for a treat. This is a well-written and exceptionally acted series. I think that the episode ""Dead on Time"" will be better enjoyed if you watch other episodes, or even prior series, beforehand. In that episode, we really get a look at Morse the man, more than Morse the police officer. It is more poignant if you've already seen Morse's other failures in the love-stakes. If you had any wonders about whether Morse and Lewis really get along, this episode will answer your questions, because Lewis really has Morse's back.

Likewise, ""Cherubim and Seraphim"" will resonate more with the viewer if you're more familiar with Morse's moods and melancholies.

These episodes first aired in England in February through April, 1992.

DEAD ON TIME
A repairman fixes the phone wiring in a fine house. When he's done, Henry Fallon confined to a wheelchair, calls his wife, Susan, to tell her the phones are working again. Next, we see him at his desk dead from a bullet to the head. He's discovered by his son-in-law, Peter Rhodes. When Morse enters the room with the body, he sees a photo of Harry's wife on the desk, and he goes very very still.

It is apparent that Morse and Susan knew each other. And it must have been serious. At first, she is concerned with not giving the totally disconcerted Morse false hope. She tells him, ""When Henry's things get sorted out, I shall be going away from here. I think you should know that."" Just how she does that will break Morse's heart a second time. But before then, she does have dinner with him at his house. And more than dinner?

Here are Morse's questions: Was Henry's death a suicide? Was the death of Peter's wife, who was Henry and Susan's daughter, an accident?

Trivia: Colin Dexter, author of the books on which this mystery series is based, has a walk-on in all but 3 of the Inspector Morse episodes. In this episode, he is an attendee, with Morse and Susan, at the Schubert reception.

In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute TV special, Joanna David, who plays Susan Fallon, talks about Susan's dinner with Morse: ""There's a commercial break just at the crucial moment, so that the world watching it will be able to form their own opinion, whether they did or whether they didn't 'do it', as it were. You asked me what I thought. Well, I think that they DID.""

HAPPY FAMILIES
It's Lady Emily Blacombe's birthday. No one seems very happy about it, including her husband and two sons. What a trio. The husband got his wealth by marrying the boss' daughter. The sons still live at home, spoiled by living in a castle with a moat. They leave the party as soon as they can for a little conference - One son is stealing from the company, and the other son is furious that his father plans to cover it up.

When one of the happy family is killed, it's made worse by a particularly pushy reporter, who decides that the way to sell newspapers is to roast Morse over the fire of the high-society murder.

Trivia: Dexter's walk-in was a little fun for him this time. He's the tramp drinking from a bottle when the reporter is on a rooftop.

DEATH OF THE SELF
At a beautiful Italian villa, a group of people, including the reclusive opera singer, Nichole Burgess, are being ""treated"" for insecurities by Russell Clark. After a little ceremony, he sends them all to walk in the woods, to reflect on their new freedom from fear. One of the participants is an English novelist, May Lawrence, who, unfortunately, manages to skewer herself on a tree spike.

Back in England, the Oxford inquest is suspended after May's husband gives a garbled speech about being pressured into doing something (and then skipping the country). The coroner demands a follow-up, meaning Morse and Lewis head to Vicenza, Italy. Morse has a particular glint in his eye at the thought of meeting Russell Clark again. Clark was a con man extraordinaire when Morse put him away for fraud. Morse cannot believe that Clark has gone straight. Fleecing rich people with psychobabble doesn't have the high stakes a man like Russell craves. On the other hand, Morse is over the moon that he'll get to meet Nichole, whose recordings he owns.

Trivia: Dexter's walk-on is where he is the man seated three seats to Morse's left, in the closing opera scene. Russell Clark is played by Michael Kitchen. If you love mysteries, then you must have seen Kitchen in the extraordinary ""Foyle's War"". It is great to see him playing a character sly and sinister in this episode, totally different than Inspector Foyle.

Frances Barber, who plays Nichole Burgess, does a good job of faking it, but the actual opera singing is done by Janis Kelly. In an intimate night-club setting, Burgess sings an aria of Gilda, in Verdi's opera ""Rigoletto"". The opera at the end of the episode is Puccini's ""Turandot"", with Burgess in the role of the slave girl, Liu.

In the TV special, ""The Story of Morse"", Barber says that the final ""Turandot"" scene was filmed at the Roman amphitheater in Verona. They filmed Barber actually singing the opera, and added Kelly's singing later in the studio. In the audience, an entranced Morse watches Nichole Burgess' big comeback with tears in his eyes. Frances laughs about the memory, because her opera singing was very bad. John Thaw, who plays Morse, teased her mercilessly that it was her singing that actually made him cry.

ABSOLUTE CONVICTION
We're in the minimum security HMP Farnleigh (Her Majesty's Prison), where not everybody likes the cocky Alex Bailey (played by a young lean Sean Bean). Half the reason he's cocky is that he and his pals got only 2 years in the ""country club"" prison for defrauding investors in their now-defunct Cryer Investments. No reparations were made, so Morse suspects that there's a lot of money tucked away somewhere, waiting for the three of them to get out.

Suddenly, it's down to to only two sharing the loot - Lawrence Cryer is killed by an induced massive heart attack. Who could get to him in jail? The other partners? How about Cryer's young wife, who's taken a lover? I suspect her just for wearing one of the worst hairstyles ever.

Detective Sergeant Chatham, young and eager, helps Morse and Lewis. They're in Morse's office when Chief Superintendent Strange comes in with a greeting, ""Nice to see you, Chatham. Don't let Morse teach you any bad habits."" And he's not smiling.

Trivia: Dexter's walk-on is as one of the inmates in the prison chapel.

CHERUBIM AND SERAPHIM
It's dawn and teenagers pour out of a cavernous industrial building, leaving what we might call a rave. One of them, Marilyn, pretty and peaceful, turns to her friend Vicky and says, ""[Nothing] can be as good as tonight... Tonight was it for me."" Terribly, we see what she means when she commits suicide. Morse takes leave from work when he finds out, because Marilyn was the beloved daughter of his step-sister.

Then two more teens commit suicide, and Morse is on the case. Something, he's sure, connects the deaths.

We get more insights into Morse when, tired and shattered, he tells Lewis about his childhood. Morse is so uncharacteristically open that he even calls Lewis ""Robby"".

Trivia: See Colin Dexter sitting next to Dr. Collier at the Seraphic drug presentation. In the TV special, ""The Story of Morse"", John Thaw says this about his character: ""I keep using the word 'sad' in relation to him, and that's the way I feel about it. That's the way I played him right through.""

""Inspector Morse"" is a top-of-the-line mystery series.

1832722,5,B00008AORL,"This series is a very enjoyable procession of who dun its-all of them. i am not much for watching any programs on tv or anywhere, but have really appreciated this non-graphic british detective series that omits out agendas, coarse language and focuses instead on the story. morse at first glance is much like a diamond in the rough, but after 1 or 2 shows, one comes to realize the hidden vulnerability and complexity of a frustrated intellectual with a strong work ethic-determined not to be overcome by circumstances. don't know if they are many out there like myself who pretty much cannot stand to watch pretty much anything newer than 1950, but if so, think you will find morse a good choice as well as inspector lewis, foyle's war and endeavor. they all have interesting story-lines, character development and are well-acted with admirable technicals. there are many more detailed reviews of the the many captivating facets, so there isn't much more to say other than watch and enjoy - thanks to amazon for making them available!",1409702400,3,1035,4.886363636363637
1832723,5,B00008AORL,The Morse series starts out well in Season 1 and just keeps getting better. Season 6 might have been Morse's zenith. NOTE: This is a show for people who really pay attention to detail and enjoy trying to solve a whodunit before the detectives figure it out.,1408924800,,257,4.48936170212766
1832724,5,B00008AORL,"This is a great series, and the Oxford setting is wonderful.",1408320000,,60,4.545454545454546
1832725,5,B00008AORL,"If you are an anglophile, and enjoy British detective mysteries, this series is a classic.  Based upon the mystery novels of Colin Dexter, this series stays true to the tone and tenor of the books.  John Thaw as Morse is amazing.  Once you are through this series, you may want to sample the prequel series ENDEAVOUR (Morse's first name) to see a younger version of Morse.  But this Season 6 continues with the quality of the series.  Morse always has diverse mysteries to solve, centered around Oxford, England.  Morse has his own demons which make him impatient and brusque at times with poor Lewis.  It's fun to see his mind working.  There are five shows in this season with the plots summarized above.",1407974400,2,706,4.682926829268292
1832726,5,B00008AORL,"Hey, the five previous seasons were, by our humble estimates, five stars.  Why wouldn't season six be the same?  After all, all the characters, as well as the script writers, seem to have their roles down pretty well by now.",1407974400,,224,4.575

1832728,5,B00008AORL,"Season 6 begins with a blockbuster!  Morse ""engaged"" to wed!  Once the numbness of shock has passed (the episode may be halfway through when recovery occurs, so no apologies for viewing it again) the energy of the story will enthrall and fascinate.  So as not to spoil the plot, I will only add a word about Sgt. Lewis: he comes of age in the matter of maintaining a delicate balance between discipline and sensitivity regarding his boss, Inspector Morse.  Truly, good stuff this series of mysteries.",1407801600,,500,4.77906976744186
1832729,5,B00008AORL,"See my review of season 4, I will always be a MORSE fan.  For all his character flaws, he remains a very interesting character.  His developing relationship with Lewis and the stories stand up well to repeated viewing over the years.",1407628800,,233,4.658536585365853

1832741,5,B00008AORL,I understand why the detective Morse series is so beloved in England.  It is an intelligent and visually beautiful show.  You do have to pay attention to the dialogue to really appreciate the solve but the quality of the show makes that a pleasant experience.  I am totally hooked on the series and wish I had access to seasons eight through 12.  Having trouble purchasing the whole series.  A great experience althogether.,1400889600,,423,4.819444444444445

1832744,5,B00008AORL,"The series is well written, weaving intricate plots in each episode and adding dimension to the main characters.  A note to haters of classic music or opera - beware!  Morse listens to both as often as he can and at high decibels!",1398211200,,230,4.4523809523809526

1832748,5,B00008AORL,"No one tops John Thaw, although I am a HUGE fan of the new Endeavour, as the opera loving, hard drinking, super intelligent, gruff, lonely and mysterious Morse. Although there is Vera-who is in many respects a female Morse!

I don't usually care to watch older TV shows, but with Morse, he's such a class act. I've loved watching Kevin Whately as Sgt Lewis ""come into his own"" over the years. Morse was often SO mean to him.

I watched this regularly years ago when it first came out and I lived in England. I do so wish more episodes were available online.",1395100800,,557,4.398058252427185

British TV is so good for plot, character development and scenery, I have to stop myself from watching all 4 episodes in a series in one sitting.  They are each almost 2 hours long so that's a serious commitment.  The acting and actors have been incredibly good, and am looking to moving on to Inspector Lewis once I have completed the Morse series.  Keep British TV coming!  It is exceptionally high quality TV.",1394582400,,502,4.584269662921348

1832752,5,B00008AORL,Beautiful views of Oxford combined with excellent crime stories. Love Morse's intellectualism vs. Lewis' proletarian character and the tongue in cheek humor Lewis uses with Morse. Wish Amazon carried the entire series.,1393891200,,218,5.84375
1832753,5,B00008AORL,"I love Morse and the sequel, Inspector Lewis. I'm a real fan of good detective series like this; what I like best about it is that Morse sometimes goes off on the wrong direction and has to rethink the final outcome.

1832755,5,B00008AORL,"Once more, the characters are developed so beautifully.  Morse is highly intellectual and very pragmatic with a softer side peering through his hard exterior.  While Lewis provides intelligence, humor, and vulnerability that Morse finds irritating all too often.  Their episodic challenges are so complex and detailed.  American television is just now catching onto the hows ands whys of British television being so successful.  And British mysteries are so engrossing, just like Morse and Lewis.  I am going to miss these two when the final season is over.  There is the continuation with Lewis in the lead - which is great too.  But, I will be caught up to where one leaves off and the other series begins.  Thank you for making such an incredibly mesmerizing show.  Linda H. Lotti",1391126400,2,783,5.0

1832761,5,B00008AORL,"Is one of the best, if not the best detective series made during these years. It continues to entertain as the character himself is so unique. Where he seems to be so hard crusted, he is genuinely quite gentle and kind at times. He tries to protect his heart, but doesn't always succeed.
