8071837,1,B000A0XTR6,"The DVD consists mainly of a 10 minute, a 20 minute and a 30 minute drill, or warm up.  Fine.  You are shown 13 different exercises that will make up these drills.

Half of these exercises are simply variations of one actual exercise. Very simple variations. Since it's a Beginner level lesson, I suppose I can accept that.  But he shows one Pentatonic Form and one major scale. Big deal.  I can find that ANYWHERE on the net for free.

I am certainly a beginner, having studied formally for 5 months, but I made up some of these exercises all by myself just screwing around one night before buying this DVD.

And a full 15 minutes of this DVD is repeating stretching shoulders, each individual finger and both thumbs along with wrists as well.  Don't waste 15 minutes of valuable teaching time showing me how to pull on my fingers.  Show me once.  I think I can figure it out.

It struck me as simply useless time filling.

You can do better elsewhere for fretboard exercises.  This is mediocre stuff.  Rubish.",1291075200,2,1011,4.513812154696133
8071838,5,B000A0XTR6,"I understand where the review by Barry is coming from, but I completely disagree. A warmup series like this is meant to lay a foundation for learning the scales and modes he finds missing from this method. The philosophy behind these warmups is both to avoid injuries and create a flexible and plastic ""hand base"" from which to operate. Some players mistakenly believe that lots of scale playing somehow magically creates a great technique, whereas this can actually create a locked-up musculature, sports-like injuries and a mechanical style. Effective training ala Lick Library is more subtle...stressing on/off periods, playing ideas versus scales, and emphasizing relaxation versus strength as the goal. Ask any player who can shred what they value in their technique more...strength or a relaxed hand and the correct position, and you will learn to value the Lick Library way.",1231286400,5,881,5.25531914893617
8071839,2,B000A0XTR6,"This DVD has thirteen very basic exercises. Only a couple of the execises are scale based. There is one 5-note pattern in G major, and a couple of very basic sequences in box 1 of the minor pentatonic scale.

If you just want to exercise your hands picking chromatic runs that have little or no practical application, that's what you get.

I was hoping for exercises that would teach scales and modes while at the same time exercising and developing muscle memory and speed.

As gifted a teacher as Danny Gill usually is, I was dissappointed with this product.",1189468800,7,560,4.636363636363637
