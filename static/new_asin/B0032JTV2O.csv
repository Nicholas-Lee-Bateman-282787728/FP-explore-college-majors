8387503,5,B0032JTV2O,"ABC is infamous for some pretty good law shows (Boston Legal, The Practice). So for me, The Deep End had some pretty high expectations to live up two. And it surpassed everyone. Although the first season was only 6 episodes, it was able to make its mark on me. The show begins with 5 law school graduates applying to become lawyers at Sterling, Huddle, Oppenheim & Craft. They all get the job, but they soon realize that working at Sterling is going to be anything but easy. Let's just hope that this show isn't cancelled prematurely like the other great shows on ABC.

  Now to the DVD. Here is what we know, the season is 6 episodes long. This means that most likely the DVD set will be 1 or 2 discs. In the special features section, commentaries will almost definantly be included. This is because ABC already includes the option to watch the episodes on their website with commentary.",1268265600,2,888,4.5375
