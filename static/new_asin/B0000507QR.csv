7928761,4,B0000507QR,"Directed by Kei Law (who also did Lost Kung Fu Secrets), this film revolves around the notorious killer Chen Wu Hai (Lo Lieh) who is on a hunt for his kung fu master who was betrayed by his own brother (Carter Wong). That journey takes him in a long & winding ride which ends up smack dab in the middle of a martial arts tournament that is more dangerous than the participants involved.

It also has Lung Fei as Carter Wong's right hand man, Chang Yi & Wang Ping as a bandit couple, Cliff Lok as a kung fu man who aids Lo Lieh a time or two as well as cameos by Wilson Tong & Robert Tai. Lo Lieh dominates the stage as the sort of anti-hero & his martial arts skill are on point with a fist style that concentrates on the pressure points. Carter Wong is one of the few that can do hero & baddie with equal aplomb plus he displays a nice mantis style of kung fu. Lung Fei & Cliff Lok does their thing while Chang Yi (in a lesser role) & Wang Ping are fine for their time on screen. All & all, this is a very entertaining kung fu flick. My only issue is the plot: how Lo Lieh links up with the kung fu master is just a bit asburd, but still this film has some unexpected twists & turns which made this fun to watch. Turn off your brain & enjoy!",1493337600,,1242,3.948207171314741
