912064,4,6304691122,"This is a tv mini series from the 80s that I always enjoyed watching.  Fair amount of humor along with light action and romance. Her wardrobe is hysterical. Could have been used for ""I Married the Mob"". Also enjoyed a young Liam Neeson as a french interpol agent. Disc quality was fairly good other than the music sometimes was a bit off. Also there is no real dvd menu so the transitions between the 3 parts of the series are a bit tricky to navigate.  Don't switch the discs after the credits,  just skip through them to the next part of the series.",1419638400,,551,4.330097087378641

I did so the very next day and lo and behold I found my movie within a matter of seconds - I was so excited I had a bit of a ""moment""!  I immediately placed the order and within less than 7 business days I had my order in my hot little hand.

This whole process is so easy, quick and efficient I dare say there will come a day when I will be able to place orders on this site with my eyes closed!

Thanks Amazon.com - you rock!

Quality of DVD is good! Sidney Sheldon was one of my favorite writers and ""If Tomorrow Comes"" is still my favorite of his  works. Wish I could find all the DVD's of his books that were made into mini series. Seems like they don't make them like they  used to.  It arrived pretty quickly! So glad!

912388,2,6304691122,If I didn't love Sidney Sheldon I would have turned this off.  The female lead was such a terrible actress I cringed everytime she got an expression on her face.  I don't write many reviews but felt I should warn anyone who wants to purchase this dvd.  All the male actors were great and the story was great of course. But I had a hard time finishing the film. Don't waste your money. Read the book.,1330646400,,399,4.223684210526316

Madolyn Smith is superb in Tracy Whitney's character, she's amazing when she changes accents. It's too bad she retired as she's a very talented actress and with Tom Berenger they are an extraordinary couple!! Love the cruise part: it's really funny and ingenious. I really love the final: she finally finds Maximillian Pierpoint and I hoped for a sequel...I would have loved to watch Tracy and Jeff's new adventures in Rio! And their wedding of course!!
I recommend this movie to everyone loves the 80's!",1313452800,4,647,4.538461538461538
912395,4,6304691122,"We bought this for old times sake as we had originally seen if Tomorrow Comes as kids.

Pro: The picture quality upgrades remarkably well on our blu-ray DVD player.

Con: The content is not well formatted in the manner we have come to expect of a DVD. There is no option to view and select  episodes, chapters and scenes from the main menu. As a result, after watching a whole hour on Disc 1, the credits started rolling,  giving us the impression the disc had ended. So we ejected it and inserted Disc 2 only to discover we skipped a whole section of the film. So we had to put back Disc One again and find the right continuation point by manually fast-forwarding the disc.",1313366400,3,674,4.368

Bank employee Tracy Whitney (Madolyn Smith) seeks revenge on the people who framed her and becomes a thief herself, targeting the rich and filthy. She joins forces with a suave older man who shows her the ropes. Enter Jeff Stevens (Tom Berenger), another thief, and hence begins the rivalry. It's a love/hate relationship and the action and intrigue keeps you glued to the screen. The acting is superb and the story line is enough to keep you interested. I highly recommend this movie.",1309046400,2,520,4.788888888888889

My favorite type of heroine is strong, independent, and yet feminine and vulnerable.  My favorite type of movie has mystery, suspense, and romance.  This movie had all three.

My guess is that I read the book first. I know in other cases, after reading the book, the movie is usually disappointing or vice verse. Or, even though I liked both, one is significantly different from the other (Rage of Angels). But from what I remember of this, it was very similar to the book and both were enjoyable.",1293753600,3,485,4.0625
912457,5,6304691122,Sidney Sheldon TV mini-series from the 1980's(??).This is the story of a young woman (Smith) who is falsely accused of a jewel theft and sent to prison. While in prison she befriends the Warden's child and the Warden arranges for a early release. She meets a distinguished and urbane older man (Richard Kiley) who takes her as his protege and teaches her to be a jewel thief. She eventually meets another jewel thief (Beringer) and eventually teams up with him. Both are pursued by an insurance investigator. Not an Academy Award/Emmy winner both still a good drama with scenes shot all over Europe. I like this move so I gave it 5 stars.,1291939200,6,638,4.654867256637168
912458,5,6304691122,"What can I say? I love Sidney Sheldon and I've read heaps of his books, including the one which inspired this DVD. I loved the storyline and the fact that the heroine had to meet many obstacles along the way to get to where she wanted. But above all, I love a woman heroine with guts; and not only is she beautiful, but she's independent and smart! The storyline line is practically a story of rags to riches, but not in the business sense, as Tracey Whitney is framed for something she didn't do and she loses everything when she ends up in prison. As the story progresses, Tracey is able to make a life for herself that is both glamorous and intriguing. I am a fan of Tracey Whitney!

as good as the video mini series. The film is 318 minutes long and is
worth every minute to watch it. I would like to order it on DVD, but
am very happy it own on VHS. The video mini series has action, drama,
comedy, and romance. A litte of everything to please all viewers.

912538,5,6304691122,"The tv mini-series, in all its true glory, died in the 80s. Jane Seymour and Jacqueline Smith were the queens of the shamelessly fun ones such as ""Crossings"" and ""Rage of Angels,"" but the oh-so-underrated Madolyn Smith brought adorable innocence to the table when she debuted in ""If Tomorrow Comes.""

  I used to drive my sister crazy during 1986 as I'd watch ""ITC"" over and over on the VHS cassette I'd used to tape the 3-night miniseries. One day in the late 90s I was shopping and I spotted the movie on professional VHS. Forgetting where I was, I squealed out loud in excitement and an elderly woman nearby looked at me with alarm before she scurried off faster than I'd ever seen anyone move. I probably should have restrained myself, but I had lost my copy years before and all the good memories I'd had of it came flooding back right there in the store.

  If only ""If Tomorrow Comes"" were on DVD...It seems clunky now to go through all three tapes, but it's still worth it, watching the story of the way-too-trusting Tracy Whitney as she faces betrayal and injustice before she battles her way back with a charm and vengeance that can only come from deep suffering and a need for closure.

  There are so many reasons to like ""ITC,"" but if I had to list five of them...

  --Revenge has never been so sweetly calculated or free of violence. (I enjoy David Mamet's brand of the dirty double cross, but sometimes it's nice to see the softer side of retribution.)

  --It's always neat to see talented actors in their earlier days (i.e. CCH Pounder, Tom Berenger, Liam Neeson.)

  --Madolyn Smith is so endearing here AND she shows so much promise as an actress. You have to wonder why she didn't go on to do bigger and better things. (""Funny Farm,"" while cute and harmless enough, just doesn't hold up to what she does in ""If Tomorrow Comes."")

  --Tom Berenger!! (Those of you who appreciate Mr. Berenger's sex appeal and understated acting will understand! To this day, I still don't get why he isn't more well-known and valued.)

  --No other tv movie that followed ever recaptured the true guilty pleasure spirit of the ""big"" mini-series (except for the very serious and unforgettable ""War and Remembrance,"" which falls under ""big"" rather than ""guilty pleasure"" since it had a very important message and hardly could be considered light fare.)

  Give ""tomorrow"" a chance! I would suggest you hold out and wait for a DVD release (which might offer a clearer picture resolution) but it doesn't look like that's on the horizon...",1124236800,32,2537,4.680995475113122
912539,5,6304691122,"Sidney Sheldon is without a doubt one of the best storyteller around. His clever way of creating high-power glitter and adventure always leaves one yearning for more. The same could be said about his adaptations to the big or small screen. From The Other Side of Midnight to Master of the Game, every celluloid delivery of his work is a must-see event, just like IF TOMORROW COMES, now on VHS from StarMaker. This 318-minute treat takes you into the world of cat burglary in which the sweet and innocent bank representative, Tracy Whitney, becomes one of the most sought-after criminals of her generation. You'll have a ball watching her get out of the unimaginable, and does she; once about every 10 minutes; some are hard to swallow but they're never dull. Madolyn Smith is a joy to watch as Tracy, whether she's being abused in prison or abusing the system. Her presence adds sparks to a feisty yet stereotypical heroine. The only downside is the all-too-wooden participation of David Keith as the insurance investigator who's on Tracy's tail. His over-the-top performance makes a dent in an otherwise talented cast of characters (Liam Neeson, Tom Berrenger, Richard Kiley, CCH Pounder). Still, the ride to this glitzy gem is a hot and bumpy one. Definitely a must.-----Martin Boucher",1108771200,4,1287,4.962962962962963

912542,5,6304691122,"I found a used copy of this 1986 miniseries, and enjoyed it very much. True, it is dated now (the fashions and the technology) but that doesn't matter. It's great fun. Some of the plot devices rely on a lack of technology -- computers were not at all mainstream, and the Internet was an obscure thing back in the mid-'80s. But the cleverness of some of the antics these characters pull is still entertaining. It's even a little *more* entertaining when you realize that thanks to our current technology, they'd never get away with that today.
It's also amazing to see the star power in this film. True, Madolyn Smith isn't seen too much these days, but she's truly remarkable. Beautiful and yet with a sparkle that transcends beauty. And she does well in different disguises and using accents! Very good.
The same year Tom Berenger did this fun miniseries, he also did his Oscar-nominated performance playing a twisted soldier in ""Platoon"". The characters in these two films could not be any more different. In this film, Berenger plays a good-natured playboy and con man who is easy-going yet strong and resourceful.
Other stars include David Keith, who's done all sorts of parts through the years (he played Richard Gere's friend in ""An Officer and a Gentleman""). In this he plays a tormented and unbalanced investigator who is on the trail of our hero and heroine. Even though he doesn't have a huge part, Liam Neeson is also featured in this miniseries (he plays a police detective). Other strong performances come from Richard Kiley, CCH Pounder and Charles Rocket, and a few more.
The story I won't go into too much; suffice it to say it follows the lives of two people -- Smith, who starts out being framed for a crime she didn't commit, and Berenger, who is a con-man who *tries* to go straight. They meet up with each other at various times through the story, in different exotic locales. Their romance is very sweet, and the exciting adventures they experience make this a fun miniseries to watch.",1040601600,49,2007,4.7371428571428575

912547,5,6304691122,"If Tomorrow Comes (directed by Jerry London) is the kind of movie one can watch many times, over and over again. It has all the wonderful ingredients of a great movie: beautiful and charming heroine, great cast, interesting and intriguing plot, international scene and romance. I love to watch Tracy Whitney travel from New Orleans to New York and then to London, Verona, Paris and Amsterdam. The settings are exquisite and her gowns are beautiful too. Great choice of music scores. The dialogue is charming and witty. Great cast includes Madolyn Smith, Tom Berenger and Liam Neeson. It's a great pleasure to watch a woman who is beatiful, intelligent, charming and kind - an amazing heroine.
It's a great movie and I'm surprised that it's not available through video rentals and stores. First time I saw this movie was in the 80s in Europe and when I came to North America, I was trying to find this film andI finally found it in Amazon's zShops. It's was great to know that I can find great films through zShops that are not available through Blockbusters of the world.

This movie is very rarely re-shown on TV and since I haven't seen the full version since the original broadcast aired in 1987, I was very disappointed to see it is no longer being produced.
Hopefully there will be enough fans out there to convince the studio to re-release it.  I hope my e-mail to the studio to re-release it will help.
