8167687,5,B00005221Q,"I enjoyed the film a lot . Too many films are a bore to watch from being excessively entertaining and self conscious.. This one I could watch.
The dialog and persons worth the time.",1427328000,,181,4.352941176470588
8167688,2,B00005221Q,"This is another waste of time, one of those foolish typical leftie movies coming from Europe.....it is bias and always against manhood and masculinity....if a man behave like a real man then is bad...only weak minded souls are cool and nice....the neo nazis are mostly confused young guys that need to channel their own insecurities in better ways...but this kind of movies are plain and dumb.
It is time for european movies to show the real facts about the evil of communism and socialism...the nazis were socialist!!! But lets show the evil of the soviet and red china!!! They killed millions and nobody is doing movies about it!",1415404800,,631,4.851851851851852

The fact that they would not or could not serve our country, as that requires honor.",1411689600,,197,4.2105263157894735
8167690,1,B00005221Q,"The film is a parody of a string of therapy sessions between a Jewish therapist and a skinhead, totally confused, Swedish teenager. I was intrigued by the early moments of the film because I have always been interested in why people such as the Nazis of the 30s and 40s were able to rationalize away what they did during the reign of the 3rd Reich.

Needless to say, I have had very little luck in discovering documentation that builds such a finding and this film added exactly zero to my search.

I becomes so bored by the premise and the individuals who were supposedly acting in the film that I eventually dropped the film before it finished. After having scrubbed my eyeballs of the drivel I was able to return to my normal life.

Forget it.",1409616000,,746,4.470588235294118
8167691,5,B00005221Q,"Everything about this movie is jolting to the viewers emotions and intellect. I found myself sensing the young man's pain and furious at what was apparently a nightmarish youth brought by an abusive, sociopathic father and co-dependant mother. I found myself wanting to yell at the psychologist to run because the young man was about to kill him. But he didn't kill him, the Jewish doctor never ran away but bravely stood the test, and my only frustration was the ending which I found to be very unsettling This movie should have won an Oscar and both actors should have won many awards as well.  I would like to have seen at least two followup movies.  One to further reveal the youth's childhood and another to continue the story of the relationship between the two men and the youth and the gang abusing him.",1403481600,7,811,4.625
8167692,5,B00005221Q,"Tala! Det r s mrkt uses a chance meeting between a Jewish therapist and a wounded skinhead to illustrate the complexities of hate and movements which are fueled by its latent explosiveness.  The story is simple.  Sren (Simon Norrthon) is a Swedish youth who identifies with skinhead culture. Violence is his favourite way of communicating.  As played by Norrthon, Sren projects a tangled web of confusion, fear, hatred, and menace. Along with Ryan Gosling's performance in ""the Believer"", this is a superb  portrayal of racist pscychology.
Sren is initially running from his own gang.  He takes refuge on a train and meets Jacob (Etienne Glaser), a kindly Jewish doctor who helps Sren and provides his card--stating that they boy should come and see him the next day.  The rest of the movie is made up mostly of conversations bewteen the two. Discussions center around hatred, immigration, racism, and the role of the parental unit in fostering violence in  children. Flashbacks give us images of Jacob's tortured youth. The intensity of some of the scenes between the two is spellbinding. Norrthon is simply demonic in his mannerisms. He's so manic and physical--he must always keep his body active during the meetings with the doctor.  To me, this suggests an animality that is not properly contained.  It isn't under control, something that Sren fears most of all.  One is never quite certain if and when he might go off and do something truly terrible. Norrthon is so dynamic and arresting that he brings a kind of erotic aestheticsm to his performance that cannot be dismissed.
I like this film because it's agenda is subtly effective and doesn't interfere with the story.  It is clear that skinhead violence is portrayed  pejoratively, but the filmmakers seem more interested in presenting a study of the intricate psychological forces that have influenced the international neo-nazi/fascist uprising amongst the youth.  Sweden is just one country that has been affected by the inevitable backlash by various groups against policies of increased immigration.
Ultimately, there are no cheap solutions offered in this film. There are debates about the factuality of the Holocaust--a most thorny subject, for sure.  Yet, the film doesn't dwell on this obvious point of contention between the young Nazi, who identifies with cleanliness and order, and the Jewish doctor, who fled Nazi Germany as a boy.  His boat came to Sweden and so he bacame Swedish.  This is something that Sren respects, after a fashion. It is all the other filthy, dangerous immigrants who are the real problem facing a once racially pure Sweden.
