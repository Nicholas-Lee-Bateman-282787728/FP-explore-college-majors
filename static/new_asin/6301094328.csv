314442,4,6301094328,"The lame announcer's 15 second introduction is cheesey and overly exploitive and doesn't belong.

They did not use experienced actors and sometimes it shows. But all the actors work hard (whether they are experienced or not) and take their roles very seriously and for the most part are not bad at all!

The plot - Three schoolteachers drive into a filling station and end up being tormented by a psychopath and his addlebrained girlfriend. That's it.

More entertaining then ""Bad Lands"" and much more watchable then ""Natural Born Killers""! More memorable then both. The non-actor Arch Hall Jr. out-shines and out-psychos Martin Sheen and Woody Harrelson in the same role and makes them both look tame.

Hall Jr. could have made an entire career out of playing this psycho. He looks and acts like the murdering animal he is accused of  - with his low forehead and thick features and crab walk - he is a Neanderthal in blue jeans - ugly, over bearing selfish, mean, and without conscious. He even lets out animal-like howls when cornered or hurt.  But he is not totally one dimensional - he is often clever in out-thinking his victims - there are hints of indignation involving his past and he seems to justify his killing spree as a vendetta that is resentment over society's treatment of his almost mute girlfriend Judy,  ""You can save your pity on her for mister her fathers dead and mothers a drunk.""  ""Teachers always laughed at Judy and said was stupid""

This film has super black and white photography by A-movie cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.

Great soundtrack music during the opening credits with crazy eyes staring at the audience. Really sets the mood.

There's Alfred Hitchcock-like suspense culminating in a very lively ""Most Dangerous Game"" chase.

Special note - the beautiful Helen Hovey is awesome going from the ultra demure, and naive stick in the mud Doris to taking a face full of dirt and then to a ""Fay Rae style"" hunted prey during the last reel of the film. -And no stunt double. The denouement where Helen pauses to listen to a baseball game is a hoot.

Fun, tense, engrossing, crazy, darkly funny, violent and suspenseful from beginning to end. You will find yourself yelling at the characters.

If you are the kind who's tastes are for the likes of Jack Hill's Spider Baby, Edward Ulmer's Detour or the Alfred Hitchcock hour - you will love The Sadist.

There are many inexpensive DVD versions of The Sadist out there - such as the one by Alpha Video. I have seen Alpha's and some of the others - All those that I have seen appear to be from ratty tenth generation film stock.

I only recommend the near perfect print from All Day Entertainment! For some dumb reason they stopped selling this version on Amazon.  But you can still order it at the All Day site. And I do not work for All Day Entertainment!  All Day's has a real cool cover too.",1015027200,2,2873,4.6779324055666
314443,5,6301094328,"First of all I have to second all the comments by the other reviewers. The Sadist is truly an overlooked gem, and Arch Hall is perfect as the archetypal loudmouthed, cretinous bully. The real-time exposition, no-name cast, and minimal ""sweetening"" of the violence really help approximate the feeling of being intimidated/violated in real life. Harder to watch at times than more recent, `explicitly' violent movies. This must have been a real shocker in 1963. My only complaint is that Arch's incessant waving of his gun gets a little tedious, although maybe it's intentional: after a while you wish someone would grab it and stuff it down his throat. If you had to be stranded on a desert island with only one drooling-psychopath flick, this is it.
Allday's DVD really does this mini-classic justice as well. The 35mm source print used is excellent and matted to 1.66:1 per cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond's specifications. There are only the slightest traces of wear (occasional very light speckling, a few blemishes), and the print is respectably sharp, with rich tonal values. Allday actually apologizes in their notes about a few flaws they couldn't fix, but overall it still looks great. Extras include chapter stops, informative production notes, a selection of Fairway Intl trailers, and the real bonus of the set, a commentary by DP Vilmos Zsigmond. This is a real treat not only for fans of this film but for just about any stripe of movie freak. His conversation runs the gamut: personal recollections and technical aspects of shooting The Sadist; his prior experiences in Europe and then coming to America; working on many other films including Easy Rider, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Close Encounters; detailed explanations of photographic techniques, etc. Find out how The Sadist shares stylistic traits with Citizen Kane and how Zsigmond feels about being repeatedly mistaken for Laszlo Kovacs!

The only other movie that I saw again that quickly was Bonnie and Clyde. It has the best ending of any shocker ever made. It is a much-overlooked American classic.

Check it out and  see what you think.......closest thing to actually being victimlized in  real life.

OK, the movie is called THE SADIST. It's about a 20-year-old serial killer and his girlfriend that terrorize three schoolteachers whose car breaks down in a remote area of California (near Needles). They make it as far as a well-off-the-road gas station/scrap yard, and while searching for a fuel pump among the wrecks in this seemingly abandoned place, the psychopath gets the jump on them.

What follows is an hour of agonizing tension. As Diamond's synopsis describes it:
""Every time we think that the film can't get any crueler, the insanely giggling Hall pulls off another outrage.""

It'll probably be a long time before I find another such movie that's better or more of a total surprise. This one's rare!

For a movie made in the early '60's, I will give it credit where credit is due. Well directed and suspenseful. Most of the actors were pretty bad., especially the bad guy. He couldn't act at all.. His whole repertoire consisted of scrunching his face into a scowl and then sticking his tongue out whiling laughing a maniacal laugh. The heroine? was really bad as well. The constant close to a smile look and then the look of fear and confusion just didn't quite make it. Overall, the picture was pretty good for a film from this year which was probably very risqu and bold.

I won't go into plot or bios, there are plenty of other reviews here for you to read about that, but I can not believe that this film has not received more attention. It literally paved the way for all the best of the independent horror/serial killer movies to follow. This movie has so many shades of Night Of The Living Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House On The Left, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc., that I almost think those directors must have drawn at least some of their inspiration for their masterpieces from this film. Gorgeously shot by the masterful Vilmos Zsigmond, and superbly directed by James Landis (no, not related to John Landis), this movie portrayed the brutality and mercilessness of a killer with far more realism than anything in its era (including Psycho). Very thankful to TCM for showing this.",1363910400,2,891,4.610062893081761
314544,5,6301094328,"When Arch Hall, Sr., opened ""The Sadist"" to a group of Southern drive-ins in l963, he was proud of what he had achieved on a thin budget of $33,000. Audience response was great, too, for viewers were shocked and delighted at seeing a thriller so beautifully photographed and acted by a group of outstanding unknowns.
This grim, nerve-wracking story of a young sadist (Arch Hall, Jr), his loony girlfriend (Marilyn Manning) and how they play with and murder two members of a trio of school teachers kept everyone on the edge of their car seats. The rapturously beautiful Helen Hovey, the prim, blonde-haired school teacher, is the only one to escape. Her race through the desert with the murderous sadist racing after her helped lift this low-budget classic to greatness.
The stunning camera angles, by a young Vilmos Zeigmos (who later went on to film The Deer Hunter, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) framed Hovey's Madonna pure face in terror while showing Arch Hall Jr.'s demonic features as he tries to capture her.
Tragically, The Sadist vanished after playing the drive-in circuit and ended up as a popular grind house feature on 42nd Street and was later butchered for TV where, in some cases, it was little more than 30 minutes long.
At long last, we have a newly minted version of this revolutionary film that was decades ahead of its time. Arch Hall, Sr. has stated that although it did well at the drive-ins, some of the managers were so unscrupulous that they would send him a check for only $12.50--and these usually bounced.
The phenomenal Helen Hovey, a cousin of Arch Hall, Jr. died in 2008 from throat cancer. She never made another movie after The Sadist. The rest of the cast sank into oblivion, although Arch Hall, Jr. is now a cult figure for his roles in Wild Guitar and Eegah--both made by his doting father, who, by the way, was Hollywood handsome enough to have been a leading man in Hollywood. You can see him in Eegah!
Many film buffs have never heard of The Sadist although it is now one of TCM's favorite cult movies.
Watch and thank the magic of film that we have The Sadist with us today. Let's remember this valiant cast and crew that suffered beneath that California sun for several days and gave it their all.
This is a film that should  stand beside Psycho as one of the great thrillers of all time!",1361145600,6,2337,4.63132530120482
314545,1,6301094328,"This is about ""bad people"" being mean to ""good people"". The bad people are a psycho who looks like something heavy landed on his face, and his horny midget girlfriend who apparently can only make squealing noises; words are beyond her. The good people are 3 schoolteachers, in the days before they were union thugs. The young guy schoolteacher likes to assert his manhood by standing up to the psycho, but always has to back down whenever the psycho reminds him he has a gun, which is quite often. The girl schoolteacher likes to make platitudinous speeches about how bad the bad people are. The bad people don't appreciate this. The older schoolteacher guy wears glasses, so he is obviously doomed, like Piggy in Lord of the Flies. Early in the film, we learn that In their school days, mean teachers made the psycho's tiny girlfriend cry, so now they don't like teachers. This is what actors call ""motivation"".

The Sadist is an incredibly dull, slow, predictable, poorly acted and poorly written movie. Though the ""action"" unfolds in real time, they somehow manage to make a minute seem like a week. The characters are  one dimensional, (or less), which is ok because the actors can't seem to even handle that much. The one good thing about it is Arch Hall's psycho retard laugh which is really funny, and easy to mimic for those special situations when you need a psycho retard laugh. Unfortunately, it's a little hard to feel menaced by someone who cracks you up every time he laughs.

This is awful stuff, created by people as untalented, dull and soulless as the characters portrayed here. We watched this for about 20 minutes and fast forwarded it to the end to see who would get popped. We guessed right. Then we gave it to some hipster friends who will try to convince people what a great and important film it is.",1360713600,10,1824,4.658385093167702

314597,5,6301094328,"All through l960, the American media and especially the movie industry trade papers were peppered with tantalizing whispers of Alfred Hitchcock's top-secret new production.

When ""Psycho"" finally premiered, it proved to be a box office bonanza and went on to make a fabulous fortune for Hitchcock--thanks largely to the backing of a powerful studio, Universal and an army of PR flacks. During the six decades since,it has been the subject of countless articles, books,documentaries, movies, homages and is rightfully considered a true movie classic.

In l963, however, a tiny production company, Fairway International Pictures, headed by Arch Hall, Sr, dropped its modest production, ""The Sadist"" into some Southern drive-ins with no fanfare and little advertising. A few posters and some small newspaper ads heralded this new movie about a ""psycho killer"" and after a few months of playdates,this cinema effort and most of its unknown cast vanished into oblivion.

Worst was to  come when its was sold to television, only to have it butchered beyond recognition, and used as ""filler"" to play at odd hours. When I saw it on TV, it was barely 30 minutes long and made no sense.

Yet, I was among those drive-in viewers who saw it on a big outdoor screen in summer and never forgot it. The  photography, for one thing, was so beautiful I wondered if this might be a film from Europe. The leading lady, Helen Hovey, was so rapturously stunning, that I wondered whether she was a new Hollywood starlet.

The movie moved so fast that it was over before I could take it all in. I returned to that drive-in theater two more times that week just to soak in this powerful movie experience.

We drive-in patrons were conditioned to watching inept junk from Roger Corman's American International days, when you often saw a microphone or a crew member in the background, the performers were people grabbed off the street, all of which gave you that disgusted feeling of having watched the nadir of ""movie making.""

Made for $33,000 and filmed in Newhall, California, ""The Sadist"" is now being recognized as a phenomenal masterpiece that was way ahead of its time. Sadly, though, like another rediscovered film, ""Carnival of Souls"" no one involved in The Sadist ever had the satisfaction of feeling triumphant in having worked on a movie that was so revolutionary.

Director James Landis introduces us to this stark, terrifying world by presenting us with a broken down junk yard,baking beneath  a blazing sun, somewhere close to a desert. A car drives up and out step three nice, respectable teachers who need their car serviced. The two men wear narrow, black ties, short-sleeved white shirts, with neatly combed hair. The woman, the glorious Helen Hovey, is attired in a pretty church dress of white lace, and white high heels. Her mane of gold hair is worn in a prim bun.

These are people one saw in church on Sundays in l963--wearing their best, looking clean and decent. They're on their way to a ballgame. Then they meet the devil--""Charlie"", a handsome,leering, smirking,demonic Arch Hall, Jr., and his giggling,moronic girl friend, Judy (Marilyn Manning).

Only l7  at the time, Arch Hall Jr.  (son of the producer) gives us an extraordinary portrait of crazy evil. His beautiful eyes and features are distorted and grotesque. Hall said later he based this performance on that of Richard Widmark's portrait of terror in ""Kiss of Death"" in which Widmark also portrayed a giggling, hysterical maniac.

Filmed in ""real time"" with no break in continuity, we watch how Hall, as Charlie, soon has the men groveling on the ground and begging for their lives. The older one is shot in his face. Richard Alden, who plays the hunky,younger school teacher, proves to be a whining milksop. His futile attempt to escape  ends in his being shot down by Charlie. We have no idea why Charlie is so psychotic. We're given no back-story. Viewers have to imagine their own Charlie biography.

Doris(Helen Hovey)wrestles with the giggling girlfriend for a gun, and after symbolically kicking off her white heels, runs barefoot for her life into the desert.

The director brilliantly shows us close-ups of Hovey's stunning face, her long gold hair now loose and flying in the wind, and Charlie's crazed, sadistic face, as he jumps into his car to hunt her down.

By the time the woman finds a place to hide, her pretty dress is torn, stained, in tatters, her hair has come loose and we see she has had all of her respectability destroyed.

Charlie is nearly ready to cut her throat when he falls into  a snake den filled with rattlesnakes. This scene proved to be--in real life-dangerous since the snakes used were supposed to have had their mouths taped up but these weren't.  Arch Hall Jr. was yanked out of the pit just in time.

The budget was so tight that it couldn't afford blanks for the guns. Arch Hall, Jr. was considered a crack shot and he offered to shoot real bullets which he did. So all those bullets we see exploding in the movie are the real thing.

The whole history of ""The Sadist"" is depressing. Arch Hall,Sr., the producer, remembers that although his movie had become popular on the drive-in circuit and the drive-in managers boasted of turn-away crowds, some of the unscrupulous ones would send him checks for, like $12.50--and these usually bounced.

The amazing Helen Hovey, as impressive as any scream queen like Evelyn Ankers and Fay Wray, never made another movie and died in 2009 from cancer. The director faded into obscurity. Only the young cameraman, Vilmos Zsigmond, went onto great success, responsible for filming ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".

I'd love to know about the filming, the mood on the set, what did they eat, drink, talk about, did the cast get along well, the problems the production must have had as the people worked beneath the blazing sun back in those long ago days in l963.

What they created was powerful and magical. It should stand proudly beside ""Psycho"" as one of the greats!",1358985600,11,6041,4.861598440545809

The Sadist is well shot, directed and acted. It's truly suspenseful, and Arch Hall Jr's character is sure to get under your skin. This is the grandaddy of all ""people's car breaks down in the boonies and they're chased by a psychopath"" genre. I haven't checked out the supplements yet, but they look great.

The film has been available for years on VHS and some inferior DVDs, but this Johnny Legend edition is struck from a clean, nearly pristine print (there are some scratches, and the sound occasionally has bumps and other minor issues). Arch Hall, Jr. gives an intense, effective performance (though perhaps not a great one) as the thuggish lout who terrorizes three schoolteachers (and others) at a dingy roadside gas station. The film unfolds in real time, just one of the startling, revolutionary, and compelling elements that make it so memorable and involving. A ""B"" movie, certainly, but so efficiently produced and so modern in feel and exposition that it could be re-shot today from the same screenplay, and work equally well on audiences.

314603,5,6301094328,"I first saw The Sadist at the Dublin Drive-In Theater in Dublin, Georgia in either the late 1960's or early 1970's as a young child. It left a very distinct impression on me. I discovered this great and underrated low-budget classic, along with Night of the Living Dead on the drive-in screen at around the same time. The Sadist stuck with me until I managed to see it again many years later on first VHS and then on DVD. I just managed to acquire the DVD that features director Joe Dante's own 35mm digitally remastered print transfer. The thing that struck me and stuck with me about The Sadist has always been the tense and suspenseful atmosphere which never lets up throughout most of the film's approximately 92-minute running time. It also greatly conveys a tremendous sense of the genuine frustration, desperation and hopelessness with which the film's sympathetic characters find themselves trapped in, a situation that begins almost from the very start until the very end. The film's screenwriter and director, James Landis does a first-rate job and his direction is both spare and tight. He uses a minimal set and production values to great and maximum effect. The acting is above average, with Arch Hall, Jr. stealing the film as Charlie Tibbs. His real-life cousin, the very beautiful blonde Helen Hovey, plays schoolteacher Doris Page. Quite sadly, Miss Hovey passed away on July 18, 2009. Richard Alden and Don Russell are also good as the other two teachers on their way to an afternoon game at Dodger Stadium. This is a true 1960's classic and remains one of the all-time greatest B-Movies ever made. It just goes to prove what can be done on a low or limited budget, with little known or unknown actors. And also that low-budget does not have to mean low quality. It still seems that The Sadist remains a little known gem outside the realm of film buffs. Someone suggested that maybe Quentin Tarantino should attempt to do a remake. I for one hope not. This film proves that you do not need graphic violence, profanity, sex and nudity to make an effective movie. It is a nailbiter and it keeps you on the edge-of-your-seat. It ropes you in and engrosses you from the very start until the very end. What more could you possibly ask for in a film?",1253232000,,2262,4.700251889168766

This is a cunning and evenly matched cat and mouse game that will keep you engaged from start to finish. It could also illustrate to the young ""writers"" of today that believable situations do not rely on people making stupid mistakes and that surprising developments are far more than a fortuitous log falling from the sky to create a stop-gap.
Sadly, the review from bt ""CAT"" is a bit misleading. It states there is ""really nothing wrong"" with the Alpha version. This DVD suffers not from a battered print but rather from video flagging that runs along the bottom of the frame throughout the film's duration. Video flagging was a defect seen in VHS tapes that became stretched out by overuse and caused bending of the picture to one side or the other. I have many DVDs with unrestored source materials and the defects work to recreate the Drive-In Experience. Video flagging was always an annoyance that took you out of the movie as the VCR tried to compensate for the error with tracking correction. With the muddiness of this print and the flagging at the bottom of the screen, I suspect that the source used for this DVD was not film...but a worn out video cassette.

314639,4,6301094328,"This film was on TCM when I turned it on about 1/3 of the way through. As soon as I saw the guy in the black leather jacket and his girlfriend, I knew they were screen reps of Charles Starkweather and his very young girlfriend, Carol Fugate, who have the dubious distinction of being America's first serial killers. Charlie had shot Carol's parents because they (undoubtedly rightfully) didn't want Carol to see him. The two of them then went on a killing spree in the midwest in the mid 1950's, not long before this film was made. They were sociopaths, who had no empathy with other humans, and no compunction about killing them,like the main characters of ""The Sadist"".

That said the acting in this film is almost uniformly terrible, the dialogue pretty basic, yet there is something about the film that is hypnotic. Sometimes, you have to ""suspend your disbelief"" (his victims are so stupid and helpless, like when one of them finally throws the gasoline in the eyes of the punk and he is temporarily blinded, he has a chance to end the movie, but somehow is immobilized).

Chasing a woman at the end of the movie, he only has a knife, as he has emptied all his shells into the body of one of the hostages (the one who threw gas in his eyes).  Knowing he had to die I said to myself ""How is he going to die? Rattlesnake bites?""  Well, that is exactly what happens! I guess he could have been eaten by a mountain lion, trapped beneath falling rocks, or some such. I guess they didn't know how to end the movie.

The wonderful California desert landscape has been the background for countless cowboy movies, and is suitably spooky and lonesome here.

But despite that initial impression, he's not a complete idiot.  One of the coolest things about this intelligent script is how Hall's psychopath is able to see through some of the schemes that these school teachers think they can pull on him.  This is an adventurous, innovative film.  The basic formula of modern slasher films can be seen here, years before movies like TCM and Halloween.  It is as effective as modern horror films like Funny Games in holding out a little bit of hope...tantalizing the viewer with it...and then snatching it away.

314645,3,6301094328,"""The Sadist"" is a pretty interesting film for a couple of reasons.  1.) For the time in which this film was made(1963) it must have been considered shocking or controversial.  The subject matter is basically a group of 3 school teachers running into a psychopathic killer and his girlfriend.  The movie is basically the killer terrorizing the 3, more mentally and emotionally than physically.

2.)  Arch Hall Jr. really gives a convincing performance as Charles Tibbs, the killer.  Many reviews I have read state that the acting is what kills this movie.  I disagree.  I think that Hall is just creepy, annoying and scary enough to make the viewer belive he is a Sadist.

3.) The ending.  There is nothing pretty about it.

This movie is well worth the purchase, since it is available on Amazon at such a cheap price.  Lots of tension and anxiety build-up and form an all-around decent picture.  The direction of the film is also very well done.

ENJOY!

Fear not, friends, for Arch Hall, Jr., does not - I repeat, does not - play the guitar or sing in this movie.  He does try to act, unfortunately, but this is as close to a good performance as he would ever have.  Hall plays Charles Tibbs, a blood-thirsty psycho enjoying the thrills of an interstate killing spree alongside his childlike girlfriend Judy (played by Marilyn Manning, yet another Eegah! alumnus).  The character of Tibbs is loosely based on real-life killer Charles Starkweather.  On this particular day, a trio of schoolteachers off to enjoy a day of baseball at Dodger Stadium end up rolling snake-eyes in the crap shoot of fate.  Their car breaks down on the way, and they end up at the salvage yard of death, a place under new, albeit temporary management - one Charles Tibbs.  So begins an afternoon of terror, horror, and silly-looking grimacing on the face of Arch Hall, Jr., obviously upset about the complete lack of Arch and his Archers performances in the film.
Our three teachers are just normal people (although the female of the group is about the sweetest and most lovely little school marm I've ever seen); they continually prove their lack of heroism by the things they do and do not do.  Nothing happens that would be considered sadistic in today's world, but I can see how this movie could have been somewhat shocking to the audiences of its day (1963).  Arch Hall, Jr., was known for playing nice guys who also happened to sing (badly) in the movies, so The Sadist marked a 180 degree turn in his film-making career at this time.  Hall puts a lot into his effort, perhaps too much.  All of the grimacing and Ernest T. Bass-like diction seems a little silly after a while, but he does manage to look and act like a psycho killer.  He also does some things that might catch viewers off guard.  The Sadist does not explicitly follow the standard ""psycho killer"" cinematic formula, and this fact more than any other makes The Sadist a movie worth seeing.  Excellent cinematography also plays a role in this film's success; this really is a stark and troubling film that has never gotten the attention it deserves.

Three people at a deserted gas station are taken hostage and terrorised by a psychopathic thrill-killer, Johnny (Arch Hall Jr) and his mute girlfriend Judy (Marilyn Manning). One of the men is a teacher so Johnny taunts him because teachers give Judy a rough time for being mute.
Pretty violent for it's time (1963, the film was inspired by the real life Charles Starkweather murders) especially the scene where Johnny makes the female hostage ""eat dirt"". Arch Hall Jr is one of the worst actors I have ever witnessed. It's beyond me how Leonard Maltin can say he is ""distressingly believeable"".It's akin to saying Dick Van Dyke was ""distressingly believable"" in CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG. Hall's acting range basically extends to screwing his face up, sneering and seeing how far he can stick his tongue out when he laughs. He reminds me of some losers I went to high school with.

7809915,4,6301094328,"Interestingly enough, Arch Hall Junior wore no facial prosthetics or special makeup during the filming of this movie, that's his real mug.
Rubber-faced Arch Hall Jr. and his child bride menace some innocent travelers unfortunate enough to cross paths with them.  Loosely based on the adventures of real-life spree killer Charles Starkweather.  A shame that Charlie did not live long enough to see Archie's masterful performance.",1483574400,,428,5.46969696969697
7809916,3,6301094328,"This is one of Arch Hall Jr's movies that doesn't have his dad in it. His movies give us a look at southern California in a time that shows us a glimpse of a smoggy world with mostly all American cars, no cellphones etc. the Sadist is amazing because when Arch Hall Jr first appears I was instantly struck by an image of Chucky on a grown man's body! Not one of my favorite of his 6 movies but unique in that Hall plays a villain, and does it creepily well. As I have been examining these movies I'm struck by the relationship between Arch Hall Sr and his only son. In Wild Guitars Arch Hall Sr plays a fiercely controlling music producer who hammers the young arrival. Makes me think there's some art imitating life here. But I think Arch Hall Sr is a damn interesting guy.",1481500800,,774,4.236486486486487
