8388558,5,B00350NZ5E,"More than a product, this (and Campbellfilms' other products) is a public service.  I'm kind of a P-39 buff (there aren't a lot of us out there), as it's one of the most beautiful looking warplanes ever built and one of the most creative in design, although not among the most successful in service.  Good information on the P-39 is very scarce compared to more popular planes like the P-51, and they are very seldom seen in film footage.  This collection is surely the finest historical film collection on the subject that can be found.  My thanks to the Campbells for their efforts in historical preservation of these films.",1325894400,2,626,4.715596330275229
