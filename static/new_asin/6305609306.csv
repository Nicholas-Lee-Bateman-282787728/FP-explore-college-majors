1053518,4,6305609306,"Maria Ewing is at her usual. To me, the best Carmen, ever. This is of course from the point of view of an opera lover who believes that opera is theater, not just singing. From that point of view only, Leontina Vaduva is a compromise. She sings well, but not credible as a 17-year old (Micaela).
But... Ewing is Ewing and this is one of her best, perhaps the Glyndebourne performance (Bernard Haitink conducting) was a little better for the drama that Ewing can provide (the first appearance of Carmen on the square at Glyndebourne is unforgettable), but that performance may not be available on DVD. Recommendation: buy it.",1046131200,14,624,4.73394495412844
1053519,4,6305609306,"Carmen is one of the most popular and performed operas, so not just any performance can be put on screen. I liked this version. It is well acted (specially by Luis Lima and Leontina Vaduva) and well sung (by everybody) and I felt each singer had the right timber voice for their respective roles. A very appropriate use of cameras and a clever and tasteful set design,  direction and montage contribute as well to make this version worthy of  its release on DVD. You will not be deceived by this one.",995068800,13,500,4.483516483516484
1053520,5,6305609306,"I was very pleased with the clear focus, the perfect sound level (did not sound like a distant voice singing like many theater recordings do)and ease of use.  The menu was adequate and I expected much less when ordering this DVD, therefore I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the show was.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys opera, since it gives a person a chance to enjoy the theatre even when we do not have a chance to get to the opera house.",977011200,11,464,4.383720930232558
1053521,4,6305609306,"I debated long and hard which Carmen to get: this live version from the Royal Opera House or or filmed version with Placido Domingo.  Here is the  Great news and the Good news.  In short, this is a wonderful (hence great)  production marred by a few technical flaws which limit it's brilliance  (hence good).
The great is firstly Luis Lima's wonderful, charasmatic  performance as Don Jose.  Imminently believable, sad, boyish and  gullible--his voice is stronger than I've seen him in comparable roles  (e.g. La Boheme). Maria Ewing's performance is less credible, not  passionate or seductive enough--seems somewhat more self-serving and  machiavellian (which is the way the liner notes suggests--""Carmen  thinks like a man."")  Nonetheless, Ewings vocal performance is  outstanding. Also great is the the lavish Royal Opera House production and  Zubin Mehta's orchestral flair.
The limits of this video, is the  technical editing and audio production.  Some of the scene editing appears  sloppy, with angle cuts too sophisticated to be effective (e.g. cutting  faster during faster paced arias.)  Or cutting to slightly blurred scenes.  And the audio quality, while uncompressed and in stereo, is not dolby  surround...hence slightly hollowed.
But, in it's whole, while not perfect  (although Lima is close), this is a good, if not long (over 2.5 hrs)  production that shows beautiful Carmen in all its glory.  A nice addition  to any library.
If Zefferelli had been involved with this produciton,  this would have been an unbeatible staging.",966211200,45,1544,5.325
1053522,5,6305609306,"Whoever said no big stars, please take back your words!  I am an opera fanatic, conductor, and composer and I have been studying the art seriously for years. If you haven't heard of Maria Ewing or Gino Quilico, please open  your ears and your eyes!  This is a star-studded cast with great truth to  Bizet's critical score and also, to the gentlemen who reviewed this DVD  above my review, Carmen is SUPPOSED to be in French.  I hope you didn't  think it was in Italian.",947289600,52,469,4.447058823529412
1053523,5,6305609306,"'Carmen' is a favourite, but this version lives up to its promise. It also demonstrates the problems with the 'star' system, but there are no 'big names' on the stage (just one in the orchestra pit). But what there is on  the stage are some of the finest performers and grand voices you may ever  hear. Don Hose and Carmencita are stunning, and the delicate delivery in  French is correct ! The flamenco sequence in the tavern is another delicate  embellishment, and just perfectly understated. Not a demonstration of  violent stage strutting, but the kind of 'play' typical of taverners. Five  stars easy !",942105600,25,607,4.788461538461538
7892282,3,6305609306,Excellent old version of Carmen. Very good dvd delivered very promptly,1512086400,,70,5.454545454545454
7892283,5,6305609306,"This DVD is ber-stirring!  I attended a ""full-blown"" production of ""Carmen"" at the Pittsburgh Opera.  The Pittsburgh iteration was indeed outstanding and would have surpassed anyone's expectations.  This performance at hand should be the ""performance-of-record"" as the Pittsburgh Opera is not available on DVD.  Buy this one.",1430870400,2,325,5.851063829787234
7892284,5,6305609306,"This is a wonderful production, one of at least three great Carmen's on DVD (this, Von Otter, and Bumbry).  All of the leads except Gino Quilco are excellent; he lacks rhythmic precision (compare, for example,  Naurent on the Von Otter) and charm.  Lima as Jose beats on anyone on DVD except Vickers who just sings it better. Lima merely sings it very well, looks Spanish, and his face and body are always responsive to the text - watching him you see Jose, not just a tenor or even not just a tenor singing very well. Vaduva's Micaela is one of the two best on DVD (Freni the other) and is probably the best given her combination of lovely intelligent singing,beauty, and smart acting. She is charming and powerful enough that one could see Jose loving her without wondering what is wrong with him. Mehta conducts very well, lacking only the extremes of charm and precision shown by Jordan (Von Otter) or the sheer beauty of Von Karajan.

Leaving the best for last, leaves us with Maria Ewing's Carmen and the direction of Nuria Espert.  Ewing's is the most complex and complete Carmen I have seen.  Her interpretation encompasses charisma, grace, sensuality, charm, sadness and despair.  Her interpretation is more complex than Von Otter's - she not only destroys men and herself; she is sometimes attracted to them, sometimes charmed by them, sometimes moved by them.  She rises both to the great purely musical moments of the score and to the great musical/dramatic moments (the Act III card scene, the Act IV finale).  Her fatalistic despair in the card scene is most moving,as is her grace and courage in the face of death in the finale.  She knows she is likely to die, but she will go out with dignity and courage. She will die but not bow or beg. I also find Ewing astonishing in her ability to be charismatic and powerful like some force of nature. In Ewing's presence, it is easy to understand how Jose could be hit by this ""thunderbolt"".

I greatly admire Espert's direction.  She is smart on the interaction between people, moves the action, sharply shows context, and does a sensational job of showing how passionate people can be even while striving to CONTAIN their passion. Under her direction, Carmen, unlike Von Otter, can be sensual and sexual without having to be directly directly and somewhat crudely physical.  Under her direction, Jose can love his mother and her world, be drawn to Carmen to the point of doom and despair, AND attempt to contain his passion. He is more than a mere crazed brute or a boy who is too close to his mother. The complexity of the characterizations of Jose and Carmen and of the relational dance between Jose and Carmen is a tribute both to the leads and to Espert's direction.

The Von Karajan production is at least the equal of this musically (and Vickers is the best Jose) and is well directed.  Von Otter's Carmen is fascinating and sensational within the limits of Von Otter's voice that is slightly small for the part.  Ewing is overwhelming.  All in all, I think this and the Von Karajan the top two choices and they are good enough that if one likes the opera and can afford it, buy both. The Von Otter/McVicar production is also on this level but a bit more limited dramatically; itis a darker production and its darkness is beautifully done but it misses some other aspects of the character and the opera.  But fascinating.

As other reviewers have noted, the one technical difficulty is the sparseness of the subtitles.",1273017600,6,3484,4.691297208538588
7892285,5,6305609306,"Lima's performance is VERY satisfying, but I treasure this production for the art of Vaduva, who inhabits the role of Micaela.  It isn't difficult to get a good singer who will look like the sweet village girl and sing the notes prettily.  Vaduva, however, makes Micaela a real person, one with whom we can actually identify; her interpretation adds great depth to the logic of the story.  All that, plus her exquisite phrasing.  As this is an excellent production, there is no reason at all NOT to buy this version of Carmen -- providing you also get a CD  with one of opera history's great (singing) Don Joses combined with a great Carmen interpreter.

Why have I not mentioned Ewing?  My opinion: I find her Carmen sulky, unpleasant, shallow and totally unattractive.  Don't let that stop you from buying this otherwise exceptional production.",1245024000,,846,4.8671328671328675
7892286,5,6305609306,"This was the second Opera we purchased for our home and I have to say that it is just marvelous.  The production quality is fantastic and taken as a whole this Carmen is riveting entertainment.  So much so that my 6 year-old daughter loves it; and my 4 year-old son - while he can't sit still to watch - loves to listen to Bizet's superb music while he plays with his trains.

Maria Ewing is a marvelous and compelling Carmen:  I cannot imagine anyone else in this role now.  She is young and feisty and very believable.  Beautiful voice.

Five Stars.  Sound quality is outstanding.  Acting and costuming is very good, as well.  If you purchase only one opera for yourself and your children, I would make it this one.

Note for Parents:  There is mock violence in this video and even worse cigarette smoking (Carmen works in a cigarette factory afterall) so be prepared with that 'no smoking' lecture.",1162080000,7,901,4.5625
7892287,5,6305609306,"I like this opera mostly because the lead female singer Maria Ewing has an unusually silky smooth voice. It's an expensive stage production with fancy props, although sometimes the recording seems less than ideal, being loud at times and hard to hear at other times. And the English subtitles miss about 30% of what's going on. I fixed this problem by looking up translations on the internet.

The commentators often call Carmen a complex character. I don't find her too complex, though. Girl dates guy, girl gets tired of guy, girl dates a different guy - seems simple enough to me!

The story is a tragedy, so if you are looking for a happy opera, I recommend Mozart's The Magical Flute instead. Otherwise, it is a good performance.",1142899200,5,734,4.7265625
7892288,4,6305609306,"This is the 2nd video/DVD of the opera Carmen by Bizet that I have seen - 2 different productions. I like this DVD because it includes English subtitles - perfect for my use as a college music history teacher. Ths music is excellent from the orchestra to the singers.

I do have one complaint with the interpretation. The final scene where Don Jose kills Carmen was a little cheesy. Several of my students found the Choreography (where he beats her before killing her) humorous. A bit immature on the student's part but none the less - I also did not think it was a believable interpretation of someone being abused then killed.",1123545600,4,628,4.607142857142857
7892289,4,6305609306,"and not even ewing's best. this covent garden production has an excellent cast. luis lima and leontina vaduva both look and sound like the don jose and micaela you picture in your imagination. only gino quilico is a little dull as escamillo. ewing has the voice and charisma to play carmen, but this production doesn't take advantage of the covent garden stage. there isn't enough motion. for example, in the habanera, she just stands and delivers. yet, she's singing about love as a flighty bird that's here one minute and gone the next. the body language doesn't match the song. with the large stage, she should be dancing, not standing. just compare her habanero with julia migenes' and you'll see what i mean. migenes seduces not only with her voice but with her body. ewing doesn't do this.
the best carmen video is still the domingo/migenes. second place goes to ewing, but not this production: the glyndebourne festival production from '86 has a superior performance from a younger ewing. more energetic, more characterful.",1095724800,9,1030,4.959537572254336
7892290,5,6305609306,"This is the Carmen which I have in my imagination. In spite of the great performance by Migenes and Domingo on the other DVD, I have some reservations about a movie-style Carmen with its lip-synching and the explicit 'realism'. I still prefer a 'live' stage performance where the excitement is all there in the singing.
Of the video recordings of stage performances I've seen, this is the most moving. Baltsa and Berganza might sing the role better, but Ewing's characterization is the best. Baltsa's Carmen  (at the Met) sometimes seem to exhibit pre-adolescent playfulness and Berganza's is a sweetie-pie Carmen. None of them are dangerous, as Carmen should be.
I do not agree with a viewer that Ewing's Carmen is Machiavellian. If that's the case, so is Callas' Carmen on EMI. Carmen is a self-assured woman who follows her instinct, and fearlessly. She goes all out to get what she wants. The seguidilla scene is so convincing compared to the others. Ewing's Carmen's character does not change in the course of the opera. She remains steadfastly what she is, from the day she picked up Don Jose to the day she got stabbed by him.
We have here also a very convincing Don Jose in Luis Lima, even though Domingo is a better singer. Just watch the finale scene and compare him with Carerras opposite Baltsa. Neither of them can compare with Lima or Ewing. Just watch Lima's frustration and fury.
Another wonderful point about this production is its faithfulness to the score in putting back those traditional cuts, even in the dialogues. It makes so much more sense.
Vaduva is a pretty Michaela and well-liked by the audience. Quilico is rather cold and self-absorbed as Escamillo. He could have been more flirtatious at least if not passionate. In this respect Samuel Ramey is better, in the Baltsa Carmen.
Overall a wonder production, with beautiful costumes and settings. Mehta conducted wonderfully, better than Levine in the Met production.",1081987200,21,1945,4.929878048780488
7892291,4,6305609306,Excellent version of Carmen.  It comes closer to the recicative version than any version that I've seen.  This one is a keeper!!,1074470400,2,128,4.7727272727272725
