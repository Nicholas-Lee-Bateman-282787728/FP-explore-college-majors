7908629,1,B00000FDVY,"It may be the most accurate version yet filmed, but accurate doesn't necessarily mean entertaining. This very cheap production looks like it was made for Dutch television in 1953. Horrendous dubbing, muddy grainy picture and atrocious editing make this one nearly unwatchable. At a ponderous 135 minutes, you'll wish you were dead long before it's over. The complete lack of any familar names in the credits should be a tip-off; despite the so-called ""co-production"" with MGM/UA, no American studio would ever release this. Don't trust the 1999 release date; it truly appears to have been filmed on 16mm in the 1970s.
***Addendum: A check of the Internet Movie Database reveals this to be a cut-down version of a 1981 Soviet TV Miniseries, which explains the dubbing, grainy 16mm picture, choppy cutting and lack of any recognizable names. ""Fred Stack"" is actually Fyodor (Fedya) Stukov. Some people may think this is a fine production, but you should know what you are ordering.
If ""accuracy"" and faithfulness to the book are what you're after, this one may have some value as a curiosity, but if you want to be entertained or to introduce the kids to classic stories, skip this one and read them the book.",994982400,5,1207,4.921568627450981
