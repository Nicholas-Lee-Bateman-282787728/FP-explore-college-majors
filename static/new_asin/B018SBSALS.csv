Watching the series with too many commercials during prime times was tedious.  Glad to have this set, beautifully done series.",1484697600,4,167,5.423076923076923
7554367,5,B018SBSALS,"The first two or three episodes were not that interesting to me. But, I trusted others who said that the show gets a lot better, and they were right -  this show has completely taken off! It's very interesting and I'm loving it so far. I have a USA blu ray player by Sony - BDPS6500  Streaming 4K Upscaling 3D Wi-Fi Built-In Blu-ray Player and it plays these blu ray disks without any problems.
Here's an overall take on seasons 1-7: Seasons 1-5 are spectacular. Season 6 was a roller coaster, and the second half was far superior to the first half. Season 7 was a roller coaster that also improved during the second half of the season. And by the way, Season 7, episode 17 which is titled ""I Went to the Woods""  was absolutely spectacular and stands out as one of the best episodes out of all 7 seasons that are in this collection.

And just a heads up, Season 8, which you have to buy separately if you get this pack, is pretty good. The last episode of Season 8 was sad, but beautiful and full of LOVE!",1480464000,10,1005,4.2460732984293195

8742874,4,B018SBSALS,"I love this show so much. It took me a couple episodes to get into it, but I got hooked fast. This particular DVD set I was super skeptical, the price was too good to be true. But it works fine in my U.S. Blu-Ray player. $48 for 7 seasons is unheard of, so excited about my purchase",1503532800,,282,3.8793103448275863
