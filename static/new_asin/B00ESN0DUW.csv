Avgn is funny but the series becomes very repetitive and boring at times with the humor appealing more to kids and young adults from the 5 to 21 year olds. Its still a good series even to this day but if you buy it for dvd or blu ray you'll find yourself cherry picking the good episodes from the boring ones.",1467504000,2,414,4.2405063291139244

5940230,4,B00ESN0DUW,"The dvd is in working order, but the case was chipped and the packaging was open. Other than that I can look past it.",1398124800,,117,3.9166666666666665
8609015,5,B00ESN0DUW,"James is a rare artist in a sea of people pushing content to simply generate views, subscriptions, and revenue. I've been watching him since one of my best friends showed me a few of his videos he downloaded in 2006. He's one of the few who values the story, the laughs, and the art that is cinematography. Once you finish this series and watch the AVGN Movie, make sure you watch his commentary and behind the scenes video. His special effects and camerawork are a fantastic throwback to the 70s and 80s style that brought so many people to the theaters and made cinema synonymous with popular media. This series eschews production value for engagement, CGI for laughs from the audience, and chasing the almighty dollar for having a fanbase who loves what he loves to do. I cannot recommend this enough.",1530057600,,804,4.669014084507042
8609016,5,B00ESN0DUW,"AVGN has got to be one of my top favorite youtubers. His videos are entertaining with a good bit of dirty humor, but at the same time extremely informative. I've watched his youtube videos countless times and probably watch his videos countless more times. You can really tell he really truly cares for his craft and see the outstanding amount of work and effort he has put into these videos.",1526860800,,392,4.614285714285714
8609017,5,B00ESN0DUW,"I love the AVGN, he's just the best and funny as hell! He speaks for all us true gamers who can't put how we feel about games into words!",1523232000,,137,3.7586206896551726
8609018,5,B00ESN0DUW,Great show! Love watching this on youtube. The Quality is great and the extras included on the dvd make the purchase worth it.,1517270400,,126,4.521739130434782
8609019,5,B00ESN0DUW,"If you are an avgn fan I highly recommend you buy these dvds. It contins all season 1 plus extras (outtakes, fan art, an interview, a top 10, etc).
The built quality could be better though, the cases feel a bit cheap. But that's just nitpicking.
All episodes are 4:3 and if I'm not mistaken 480p. If you still have an old crt tv laying around I recommend you use it to watch all episodes. You can't go more to the past than that!
Overall great purchase. Hope they release season 10 soon. Im planning on buying all 8 remaining dvds.",1515542400,,531,4.267326732673268
8609020,4,B00ESN0DUW,LOVED the series since i first herd about AVGN from KOTAKU/Gizmodo?Lifehacker and ive been hooked ever since 5 years ago when screw attack still had exclusive rights to AVGN and now i own the first season on DVD got it purely for the extras i will be buying all 9 seasons thank you so much James and Mike for a fantastic series,1493769600,,327,4.290322580645161
8609021,5,B00ESN0DUW,"I  have been a fan for a long time and kept getting lost in my YouTube playlist. So I bought all of these and the movie at once. They are in great condition and good packaging. It is exactly what you would expect from any electronic store. As always with AVGN and James Rolfe the artwork is awesome and well thought out. The spine artwork on all the dvds go together to make a picture saying the title of the series. This feature makes you want to purchase them all and I think he knows that. As for the content it is great. You can play specific episodes or play them all at once. Each DVD has special features which truly show how much effort James and his team go through to give us a great show. If your reading this James, I am a big fan of many years. Please keep it up and keep the laughs coming.",1485561600,3,803,4.050314465408805
8609022,5,B00ESN0DUW,"I love this youtube channel, now I have a permanent copy of the first volume. Look forward to collecting the rest.",1481760000,,114,4.476190476190476
8609023,4,B00ESN0DUW,"All the hilarious and disgusting fun of the original volume 1, condensed onto one convenient single dual-layered disc.  If you missed out on the original set and don't want to pay 50$ for the Bluray set, then this is definitely the set for you.  Repackaged with new box art and nice spine art that, when assembled with the rest, make the AVGN logo.  It also has all the original special features of the original set.

Worth the money, so pick it up if you need the nerd in your life.",1473465600,,483,4.333333333333333
