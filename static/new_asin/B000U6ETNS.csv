What was my unhappy surprise, when I started to play the dvd and found out it's taken directly from broadcasting! Together with all the commercials and logos and everything! The quality is bad (not outrageous, but not very goot either - they could at least used HDTV taping!!!)
Also the subs apart from the very first DVD are gibberish, it's not even bad English, it's pure nonsence. If I haven't known vaguely what the drama is about (mind you, the drama is really great), I wouldn't understand even one tenth of what's going on the screen. Can't imagine people are actually getting payed for translations like this. Such a disappointment.",1286928000,4,707,4.709677419354839
