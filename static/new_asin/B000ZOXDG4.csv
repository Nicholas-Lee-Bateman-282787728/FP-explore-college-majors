3043488,5,B000ZOXDG4,EXCELLENT FILM,1507593600,,14,6.5
3043489,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate Blanchett is marvelous in both Elizabeth and this sequel.  A wonderful supporting cast, and some realistic period action make for a fast moving, terrific costume drama.  She and Judi Dench have Elizabeth covered!",1507507200,,217,5.352941176470588
3043490,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Great movie, I will be ordering the DVD so I can watch it again whenever I want!",1506643200,,80,3.764705882352941
3043491,3,B000ZOXDG4,Not as entertaining as I was expecting.,1504828800,,39,4.714285714285714
3043492,4,B000ZOXDG4,"We were wondering how she had all of the hair shown at left when earlier in the movie, they made of point of showing what the reality of the time was - very short hair and wigs due to the bugs everybody had in their hair.",1504224000,,221,3.8260869565217392
3043493,5,B000ZOXDG4,Very Good,1502582400,,9,4.0
3043494,3,B000ZOXDG4,"A huge disappointment after the first movie.  Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush were very good, and aged nicely, but I found many of the other characters somewhat caricatures (such as the Spanish ambassador and the young German prince).  Clive Owen did not seem at all the right person to play Raleigh, who was both a scholar and a swashbuckler.  Making Raleigh the focus of much of the movie, romantically involved with the queen and hero of the defeat of the armada (neither historically accurate - didn't the director know that Raleigh stayed on shore, and hadn't he ever heard of Howard of Effingham or Francis Drake?!), was unfortunate.  It meant that the movie largely glossed over the incredibly convoluted manoeuvers that Elisabeth was forced into when ruling over a small country still deeply divided between Protestant and Catholic, and with Catholic monarchs on the continent eager to conquer England either by marrying her or by invasion.
The sets are dramatic throughout, and the interview with the set designer was fascinating, but I couldn't help thinking that the Tudor palaces were not built to the same scale as the gothic cathedrals.  For example, Winchester has the longest nave in Europe, and it seems quite out of proportion when occupied by only one or two actors.",1502409600,,1286,4.990654205607477

3043502,1,B000ZOXDG4,Very boring movie. Couldn't get past the half way point. I watched The Tudors and was expecting something similar to that.,1496620800,,122,4.857142857142857
3043503,5,B000ZOXDG4,"A superb period drama that while not historically accurate, still gives the viewer a taste of some of the public and private burdens that queen Elizabeth may or may not endured whilst ruling England. Great production values, great plot lines, great acting. What is not to love?",1494201600,,277,4.914893617021277

3043507,5,B000ZOXDG4,"I loved re-watching this most excellent film about Elizabeth I of England. Cate Blanchett is such a fine actress.
The story is wonderfully told, the costumes are simply amazing and the sets are sumptuous and very, very real.
This is one of my favorite films and is historically significant as well as entertaining.",1490140800,,314,4.943396226415095

3043520,1,B000ZOXDG4,"Didn't watch the whole thing. Was disappointed in the emphasis on ""romance"" with Raleigh, and disliked the emphasis on Elizabeth as a single girl looking for a man. Costumes were fun to look at but not completely accurate.",1485820800,,222,4.868421052631579

3043522,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Wow. What a great  acting tour de force by all involved. If you know nothing of early English  history, you might be a little confused by all the characters, but the script moves fluidly and is fascinating to watch. I loved Clive Owens performance as Sir Walter Raleigh.",1485820800,,270,4.604166666666667

3043535,4,B000ZOXDG4,"This movie featured great acting but was not so great on historical detail. I saw this movie in the theater when it first was released but still enjoyed it a lot. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as Queen Elizabeth I, Clive Owen is an impressive Sir Walter Raleigh, and Geoffrey Rush was an excellent Walsingham. If you like British historical pieces you'll like this one. Just don't count on it as an accurate historical representation. Although much of what was portrayed did happen in some form or another, much of the period's history was not accurately woven in. I like it a lot anyway!",1485734400,,586,4.699029126213592

3043573,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I would have rated the movie higher, but it took too many liberties with history.
In reality, Queen Mary preceded Elizabeth and died of natural causes. Elizabeth became queen by natural secession to the throne. Elizabeth did not chop off Mary's head as high drama in this film suggests.
A beautiful film with elaborate and well researched costumes, but don't be fooled into believing this is history other than the names.
Finding truth in the story is like mining diamonds in a manure pile. File this movie under fiction.",1485043200,,521,4.865168539325842

This time period in her reign, and the interesting subject, would have made for a much better movie if either the script had been sharper or the director had followed the written word better..At times it was easy to see the ""Hollywood"" movie as heavy on romance and action but light on substance. The costumes and set design were spectacular though. If you love history about Elizabeth or the British monarchy you may still enjoy this movie.",1484524800,,585,4.745098039215686

3043679,1,B000ZOXDG4,"Why did they feel the need embellish Elizabeth's story?  She is the most interesting historical figure from the era, so much so, that it's called the Elizabethan era.  There was no need to glamorous her into a armor clad warrior princess.  And how did Raleigh take Drake's role during the Armada attacks?  Sorry Sir Francis, you just weren't sexy enough to make  the cut.  The real story would have been more interesting, focusing on Catholic vs. Protestant tensions in England, the series of skirmishes from Plymouth to Calais, and how Englad's victory changed the axis of power in Europe.  Instead we witness a goofy love triangle that has Elizabeth as a jilted woman rejected by Raleigh, policy decisions aided by the court astrologer and a Spanish Ambassador with his cadre of indignant dignitaries.  Cast Blanchett is ok as an actress, but whoever wrote the script ought to be drawn and quartered in good English fashion.",1483574400,,926,4.929032258064516

Helps to know a bit about English history to appreciate the events leading up to this woman's Queenship and her pain/struggle in power. This movie is only a small slice of her life: pressure to marry and make an heir, betrayals and exacting brutal justice in her own family and the menace & vengeance of Spain upon her.

3043882,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I appreciate the craftsmen who labored to create this costume melodrama. All the locations are gorgeous with sublime architecture. Cate Blanchett is not appropriate for the lead role. The supporting actors, the walk-ons and the crowds have shining moments. One feels sympathy for Mary, Queen of Scots, and the young Isabella. The battle and defeat (how could this be a spoiler? It's elementary school, Watson) of the Spanish Armada due to ""God's wind"" is thought-provoking.",1481500800,,473,5.32

3043884,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Absolutely gorgeous film to behold - the sets, the costumes, the ships, everything is just beautiful.  The only thing I could be critical about, is the story.  Yes, it is about Queen Elizabeth but the film couldn't quite figure out how to tell this part of her story.  Are we watching a bio flick, a romance, a war film or a docudrama?  I guess it's a buffet of film, and it is simply beautiful.  Cate Blanchett is perfect royalty of the age.  Geoffrey Rush is brilliant.  Clive Owen is Clive Owen dressed an Elizabethan costume, and it works.  Samantha Morton, I think, is a real standout.  An excellent film!",1481155200,,610,4.522935779816514
3043885,4,B000ZOXDG4,"A movie with varied effects on the viewer. The cinematography, the acting, the period costumes are all wonderful. But there are considerable periods where nothing of great substance appears on screen, with the result that Boredom rules. On the other hand, there are periods, such as the actual engagement of the Spanish armada with the British navy, where the resulting scenes are truly spectacular.  Cate Blanchet as Queen Elizabeth with long and loose red hair and in full-body shiny panoply is a sight to behold. More bold strokes in the narrative and some judicious editing would have yielded a 5-star movie. As is, 3 1/2 stars sounds about right.",1481068800,,651,4.972477064220183
3043886,1,B000ZOXDG4,Ah yes the feminist rewrite history. Instead of the truth we have fantasy. You go girlllll.  Nope didn't watch it after I saw Cate in armor in the trailer.  What was the point. The first movie where Cate played Elizabeth was pretty good. This is so disgusting.,1480982400,,260,4.51063829787234
3043887,4,B000ZOXDG4,"A good portrayal of Elizabeth I---good, but not the best I've seen.  That honor goes to the Elizabeth (mini-series, perhaps as it was 4 hours long) played by Helen Miren (oops, I think I botched her name) anyway, her delivery of that role was absolutely glorious with Jeremy Irons as the Duke of Leister.  A brilliant movie that actually gave the queen's actual speech to the troops----where she said:  ""I know that I am a frail woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king---and a king of England.""

 I felt that movie was a bit more intimate---but, of course, that is just my opinion.  But, don't take my word for it---watch both films and see which is better.",1480636800,,667,4.471074380165289

3043905,4,B000ZOXDG4,"The film is about Elizabeth I and her war against Spain.

Jeffry Rush plays a deliciously Machiavellian minister and Clive Owen is Sir Walter Raleigh.

Elizabeth wants a family and happiness, and her biological clock is ticking.  Raleigh looks like he might provide the ticket, but Rush's character manipulates the situation to destroy that chance.

3043907,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Its hard to believe that I have walked by her grave in West Minister Abbey and stood where she is buried. Ive literally stood on top of her fathers remains, Henry VIII.  These are memorable visits but watching movies like these brings to life characters that are literally bones underneath the granite in which they are buried. History indeed that leaves us in awe.

I enjoyed the first Elizabeth film. Now we are ushered into another dramatized era entitled, Elizabeth: The Golden Age.  I will admit that I can enjoy a movie that has not received good reviews from critics or the audience for that matter. Of course, our tastes in entertainment and what floats our boat (or TV remote in this case) varies as much as our individual personalities.  Apparently, this is the case.

I've read critical reviews that the splendor, costumes, sets, and music were too sumptuous and weighed down the movie, distracting from the characters.  What hindered the critic from his enjoyment of this film, frankly enthralled me to no end. The sumptuousness of this version is what I enjoyed. I do not think that it detracts from Cate Blanchett in her portrayal as Elizabeth. Elizabeth in her own right is a complex character underneath her beautiful costume dresses, and the story is mostly focused on her struggles of remaining a powerful monarch, whose throne and life are under constant threat, yet struggling with the human need for love. This indeed is a Golden Age of her reign, which I think was the purpose behind all the sumptuous sets, etc.  I loved the soundtrack as well.

The only negative, of course, is that Geoffrey Rush is back as Sir Francis Walsingham, protecting Elizabeth1the queen, and torturing traitors left and right. Those scenes for me are the fast forwards or close your eyes and plug your ears moment. As you probably can tell from previous reviews, violence is not my forte.  Nevertheless, the truth of the matter is that torture happened and gruesome deaths awaited many of the main characters who played in history of ages past.  Even Sir Walter Raleigh eventually lost his head after the Queen died and his favor at court lessened.

Yes, I like this movie and all of its golden glory. Some of the best scenes are, of course, Elizabeth on her white horse and dressed in armor urging on her troops as the Spanish Armada approaches their coasts. Among all of these historical moments, I always find the religious aspect interesting, as well as each side prays to God for the victory believing it is heavens will for them to win.  Movies like these lead me to Wikipedia so I can read and learn the historical truth of these characters that lived and reigned in England.",1465689600,,2682,4.756465517241379
3043908,5,B000ZOXDG4,"I've seen this movie a bunch of times, and I love how it both humanizes the queen and exposes how the woman made herself into a Goddess-ruler.  I love some of the little things, like King Philip's quirky walk, and that the Infanta has a Queen Elizabeth doll.  The encounter between Blanchett and Redmayne is awesome in every sense of the word.  The looks on their faces before and after he fires at her are amazing for their intensity and the thoughts visibly racing through their minds.
I'm a wuss when it comes to violence and torture, so I had some problems with Walsingham's tasks, but totally love the portrait Rush gives of a devoted, intelligent, strategist-bodyguard.  His agony over having failed to see the trap Spain set for him is gorgeous, as is Blanchett's at having to execute her cousin.  Again small things grabbed me, like the reactions to catching her in treason from Mary of Scotland and her guard (Tom Hollander).
Generally a wonderful cast in a wonderfully directed epic of renaissance politics.",1465430400,,1017,4.788571428571428

3043915,1,B000ZOXDG4,"Oh, my. It's almost impossible to represent in a short review just how bad this is, because it's not comprehensively bad in fact, it had the potential to be good. During the first half hour or so, my wife was enthralled with the costumes, and I confess, some of them were impressive. And the earlier film about young Elizabeth Tudor's accession to the throne, also starring Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush, was pretty good. But the writing in this sequel is terrible, and this film generally reminds me of that Kardashians-Do-16th-Century-England show 'The Tudors'. Blech.

In a sense, this is the story of the Spanish Armada's defeat. But just as James Cameron in 'Titanic' took one of the most gripping and thoroughly-documented events in history and, feeling that it wasn't gripping ENOUGH, goosed it by fabricating a clich love story, here in 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age', we get the story of a fantastic maritime victory (or defeat, depending on your perspective) but the actual stuff done in boats is pretty silly, and most of the movie is soap-opera quality romance. Who knew that history could be this embarrassing?

Final note: No Shakespeare in this golden age. So what's the point?",1464048000,,1187,4.959798994974874

3043917,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Note:  It is difficult to rate literally works, such as this due to the subjective nature of the viewer/reader/listener.  My review is based on my own experience with a multitude of similar works.

'Elizabeth, the Golden Age' is the sequel to 'Elizabeth,' also with Cate Blanchet.  This is not a write-up of the first part, but it is difficult to consider in pieces.  Akin to reviewing 'The Godfather, Part II' without at least its part 1, in my opinion.

To my knowledge, there are three primary English-speaking movies dealing with Elizabeth's the First of England as its central theme.  This one, the Masterpiece Theater production 'Elizabeth, The Virgin Queen' with Anne-Marie Duff, and Elizabeth I with Helen Mirren.

Each of the three works brings an important contribution to my contemporary modern view of who Elizabeth was.  I am sure that it far from the real person.  Each also provides a perspective that is beautifully achieved and unique.

This work with Cate Blanchet is beautifully executed and as expected incredibly staged and prepared.  The story is well told and each primordial  element (director, music, setting, etc.) is first rate.

The drama and passion of certain events might be a bit exaggerated for those of us who also are history buffs, but as a movie it is worth my dime and almost expected.

One important aspect to mention is that it has English subtitles.  I find this important to understand British-language productions.  I know the Masterpiece Theater does not have subtitles and still find parts difficult to comprehend.

In summary:  I believe this one to be the most mature (by Hollywood standards) of the three works I have watched.  Helen Mirren's is definitely a close second.  For some reason I still enjoy the first part better than the second, but as I mentioned they are both part of the same people telling this story.",1463788800,,1867,4.919871794871795

3043996,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Beautiful ! Another masterpiece by director Shekhar Kapur. I loved the first one, because it was the story of her coming into power. In this one, she's older and fully involved in complicated political situations. She has matured and is thoroughly involved in totally being Elizabeth the Queen. The frivolity of the first story is not there anymore. Things have become serious, but she goes on to overcome all the obstacles that get in her way and does a splendid job of taking out the Spanish and eventually turning England into a world power. Once again, each scene is beautiful and here her costumes are even more gorgeous than in the earlier film. When she goes out to speak to her troops, dressed in armor and, for the first time not riding side saddle, sitting on that white horse and wearing a long white cape and with her long red hair flowing in the wind, she looks like a goddess. You can see the admiration in her men's eyes and their morale becoming stronger.

3044005,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Since I have a deep love for Queen Elizabeth and everything that she had to go through, I I hate and love this movie at the same time. I understand and accept that it's a movie, and it does not all have to be based on facts, but do you lure people in. But some of the inaccuracies is what made me hate it. The things that made me love it where of course all of the beautiful gowns.

I do wish that they would have changed Queen Elizabeth character just a tiny little bit so that she wouldn't seem so shallow. Because if all of the history books I have ever read depicted her the way that this movie had, I probably would have only read one and been done with it. I am kind of glad that I was born in this time, but I still think that part of me would have done really well in those days also. How cool would it have been to battled the Queen of Scots was Queen Elizabeth?!",1438819200,,872,3.926553672316384
3044006,4,B000ZOXDG4,Excellent sequel.  Not sure if King Phillip was that unstable.  Hollywood has a tendency to bash the Catholic Church,1438300800,,116,5.052631578947368

I found this movie to be very entertaining on the totally ""entertaining"" spectrum. Very colorful and fashionable (did they really dress like that?). There might, in fact, be some authenticity and true history here, also, but it's pretty much hidden and packaged otherwise. All in all a great chick flick.",1437696000,,449,4.921052631578948

3044034,3,B000ZOXDG4,"ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE

 Director Shekhar Kapur has brought back Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush to pick up the story of Queen Elizabeth some ten years after his 1998 film, Elizabeth.  Blanchett and Elizabeth are both somewhat older in the new film.
  Blanchett is properly queenly.  Rush, reprising his role as Walsingham, the queen's minister and spymaster, does his usual workmanlike job.  The impossibly dashing Clive Owen brings the myth of Sir Walter Raleigh to life.  Abbie Cornish, as Raleigh's love interest, adds the necessary eye candy.
 The problem with this film is that it is neither fish nor fowl.  We have murder, an assassination attempt and torture.  We have execution by rope and by ax.  We have beautifully done slow motion mayhem when the English navy battles the Spanish Armada in the English Channel.  We have Cate Blanchett, who wears armor like no other actress, making a wonderfully inspirational speech to her outnumbered troops.
 Alas, all is for naught.  Too much viewing time is filled with the emotional wrestling of the Virgin Queen.  Or what the writers imagine her emotions to be.  The digressions into the Spanish and Scotts courts add nothing to the narrative or the psychic tension of Elizabeth's soul.  It succeeds neither as a chick flick nor as grand historical drama.
 The acting is fine; some of Blanchett's oratory is truly grand.  The costumes and sets are true to period.  In spite of the excellent cast and good efforts of all involved, I can give this film no more than two and a half saw blades.",1424390400,,1547,4.873076923076923

3044037,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I loved the drama and the visuals to the movie, but disliked how the battle scenes were not detailed. There was no display of tactics in the battles and how exactly they were victorious. I thought they could have done some background more on pirates during that time period in the New World and some of the conflicts that occurred there. Also, It is documented that Ivan the Terrible wanted to marry Elizabeth and have a military alliance with her, but in the movie he get about 3 seconds of time! The most powerful Russian ruler who was a genius tactician and who was undefeated in all of his campaigns, conquering massive swaths of land. At least have a scene about an ambassador's visit and something with Russia... anyway I would have taken the creative license and a more global view focusing more on pirates, and Russia. Taking this in mind, I was annoyed by seeing Elizabeth as some bipolar worry-wort crying about how Spain will most definately destroy her when in fact in was the opposite-- England had superior cannon technology and ships. My final qualm with the movie was the complete lack of any scene taking place in the Spanish court or mainland or any scene in Rome. This makes it seem too detached. For what it was, it was ok but doesn't satisfy my taste. Without the visuals it would be 1 star.",1423699200,,1312,4.563559322033898

Add to that, Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary to the Queen Elizabeth and popularly remembered as her ""spymaster"", demonstrated the true nature of political intrigue, with its innumerable shifting angles as well as facets, such as turning on a friend that became involved in intrigue and even more so with respect to Mary, Queen of Scots. This movie is so good that... my opinion only... other films as The Virgin Queen (1955 and 2005), Elizabeth Rex (2004), Gloriana  (1984 and 2000), Elizabeth  (2000), Elizabeth R (1971) or Young Bess  (1953) don't even come close to showing the true Virgin Queen of Old England!",1417737600,,841,5.079710144927536

3044073,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Casting shines and plot more fast paced than ""Elizabeth"", the first movie of Elizabeth I coming to power. While history has been massaged and shuffled around a bit, it has been done for dramatic purpose. It marks the beginning of the great British Empire's expansion. The movie does show that it wasn't that much fun to be a Royal (in fact it was more hazard prone and deadly then they show). If Spain's monarch seems a little over the top, do some research on the families of European monarchs of the 14th to 17th centuries then you will know how the French Revolution came about. Care Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush and Clive Owen all give nuanced and believable performances.  Plenty of extras for movie making buffs to devour.",1408752000,,724,4.700787401574803

She lived the first part of her life with the threat of death hanging over her head was real and could come at any moment.  Also the religious separation of the kingdom at that time and how when she finally did become queen, she was urged constantly to return the kingdom to the Catholic religion with no tolerance for anything else.

3044096,2,B000ZOXDG4,The costumes are stunning. So I suggest you put on the mute button and freeze the frame to look at details of the costumes. The storytelling is some of the worse I've ever seen on film. This film is more an orgy of images. I found it difficult to understand what the heck was going on for half the film. At that point I stopped and went online to read a synopsis of the so called plot. Cate Blanchett can do no wrong as an actress. But that's not enough. So in a nut shell: No story. Pretty costumes.

3044150,3,B000ZOXDG4,"This movie has pretty much the same Controlling Idea as the previous Elizabeth movie: that devotion and inner strength is required to protect one's country. But this movie does a way better job of proving the idea. Even though as queen, Elizabeth is far removed from the physical battle and spy vs spy action, her actions (and inactions) drive every turning point forward. When she wavers, England suffers, when she is strong, England triumphs. This makes for a very satisfying ending where she rallies her troops to defeat the Spanish armada in one of England's greatest naval victories in history. Great movie.

The packaging on it should let the viewer know this, instead you learn of it in the BONUS section of the DVD. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress, who can transform herself in such a way as to put you in the  space of the person she's playing; and she did so with this historical character.. AS most, I've heard of her or read something about her, but in this movie--though embellished; It's Elizabeth you focus on and feel for. You see the responsiblity her life contained, the stress and her strengths and weaknesses. The movie has historical background, but it is Character driven, so that is what a viewer who watches this movie should really bend toward; and it would be good to view the first part first, it would put some continuity to this one.",1371600000,,873,4.490566037735849

Action, intrigue, excellent acting, incredibly beautiful sets, camera shots, lighting, etc....  If i could improve the movie, I would have made it a tad more clear as far as the plot, (i.e. WHY was Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots in ""jail"" in the first place?) but if you can  bear not quite understanding everything, it was fabulous.  Love, adventure, etc.... Just beware of some particulary gory scenes,
as torture was commonplace in those days.  Definite parental discretion advised on that.  Also a vague sexual scene, although there was no nudity.  Also great for fans of ocean movies: great scenes at the end, of adventurous boating and war as the Spanish Armada attacked Enland.",1363392000,,950,4.75
3044165,5,B000ZOXDG4,"While this may have taken a few liberties with history, this was still excellently done as Cate reprises her role as Queen Elizabeth as she settles into her duties at court. There are still intrigues--and a war with Spain in the offing, and a bittersweet affair with Sir Walter Raleigh, a handsome rogue who fell in love with a different Bess, all while romancing the Queen and seeking favor. The largest intrigue is with her prisoner, Mary Queen of Scots and her upcoming execution. King Phillip of Spain uses this execution as an excuse to launch an all out war with England and there is many an anxious moment as the Queen knows the Armada is coming, and can do little to stop it on her own. Her words of prophecy to the snide Ambassadors from Spain however, do come true as both fire and storm contrive to humble Phillip as he is left bankrupt when the Armada fails to deliver the sure victory he thought he had.

This follow up, Elizabeth: the Golden Age, does not meet that level of quality in either ideation or direction.  While I think Cate Blanchett did a wonderful job in both movies, the second film had a more 2-dimensional set of characters.  This is especially evident with the representation of the Spanish Catholic characters - most especially Spain's King, who is about as stock a villain as I can imagine -- I half expected him to swirl his mustache.  As someone who spent years in Renaissance and Reformation Studies, I am no fan of the Spanish Empire of that time period.

3044193,1,B000ZOXDG4,"I liked the first Elizabeth film. There is no way this sequel could have been written by the same writer. Rather than a story; this film is a series of images with weird music, and disconnected, meaningless, dialogue which does not connect into a story. The lavish costumes and sets give you the impression the film is going to tell a story, but it never does. I read the reviews and was expecting an okay movie that was not quite as good as the first. However, it was far worse than I expected.

There is a subplot about an assassination, but we only see a small piece of the story, and are left with more questions than answers.

There is a subplot about the Spanish Armada, and there is no story here at all; just images and weird music..

There is a subplot about palace romance. You get a beginning and end with no middle, and no rhyme or reason. ""Weird"" is the best word to describe the script. Some new-wave artist is presenting us images with weird music, and a dialogue intended to match the weird mood of the images and music; rather than tell a story.

There is more story in the reviews than in the film. There is no story in this film at all. The writer should never have been paid, because he never wrote any story. The writer should be flogged, keel-hauled, and stretched on the rack for ripping us all off; along with every reviewer who gave this more than one star, because they did not want to admit they had been swindled.",1341964800,,1441,4.345724907063197
3044194,1,B000ZOXDG4,"The first film had many inaccuracies yet managed to hold itself together in quite an arresting way. The Golden Age is equally full of historical holes yet fails abominably. (The absence of Dudley and Essex, two key players at Elizabeth's court, did not go unnoticed.) The reason for this is, I think, less to do with factual errors in major historical events--such as details of the Armada--and more to do with inaccurate characterization. Clive Owen is decidedly charmless as Walter Raleigh, who should have been vain, captivating, and merciless. Cate Blanchett projects neither the majesty nor the flirtatiousness of Elizabeth, preferring to foghorn her lines like a novice transvestite. Laurence Fox's Christopher Hatton doesn't dance once. I know very little about Philip II, but that is ultimately unnecessary since he utters the same camp threats in every scene. The music is over-the-top and irritating. The writing is so preposterous that it's almost an afterthought. The camerawork largely consists of slow-motion close-ups or revolving shots reminiscent of fashion adverts. These techniques are used throughout the entirety of Mary Queen of Scots last segment, making it painfully melodramatic. The director also relies several times on the ""God's-eye-view"" shots he employed in the first film. I wished several times that God's eye would unhinge and squash Blanchett, thereby ending her strutting second-rate drag-queenery once and for all. And was I the only one that shivered when the film went chillingly jingoistic near the end?

The movie as stand-alone entertainment is far superior to the first movie in this series, Elizabeth. The pace of the movie never lagged and the scenery was splendid as it portrayed England during a turbulent period of its history.

As I expected, Cate Blanchett did a marvelous job portraying the queen as did the other actors in their roles. The visual effects of the battle with the Spanish Armada were very well done and the scene of Elizabeth encouraging her troops before the battle almost brought tears to my eyes. The audio and video quality is both excellent.

There are a number of special features which include one rather grotesque shot of a decapitated head. One problem we encountered involved understanding all the words; it seemed as if the music got louder as the actors started whispering making it very difficult to catch all they were saying. We solved that problem be activating English subtitles; after that we didn't miss a word.

You see a lot of people hating Elizabeth with little or no explanation as to why other than the over used bastard, whore, heretic reasons/descriptions. Caricatures is a word to sum up all of the performances.  The Golden Age is a woefully poor sequel to a movie that was sheer pageantry.  Cate Blanchett in one of the featurettes said that she felt that she had gotten it all wrong.

The current ""no child left behind,"" uneducated generation excepted, most other kids learned about Elizabethan England and the Armada in the 7th grade, I know I did. This film was accurate about the armada being wrecked in a storm and that's about it. The rest was pure disappointing fantasy. How on earth could a director or producer expect an audience to buy into this already well known event in English history? The real Queen Elizabeth powdered her face white in the fashion of the day. One of her favorite swear phrases was, ""God's death!"" Where were these? And the sight of Elizabeth in Joan-of-Arc armor rousing the troops was actually too comedic for any halfway educated audience to swallow. The writers need to find another line of work. Truck repair or WalMart cashier come to mind. The director used every directing cliche' in the book. A real hack job. The Spaniards were depicted as Darth Vader villains, with dark clothes and mean looking faces.

Nothing was good about this flop except for some of Cate Blanchett's acting, the costumes, and the cinematography. Those are the only reasons it deserves even one star

But then, I really shouldn't complain because I bought this DVD stinker in a Goodwil store for 99 cents. The Cover art and data indicated it was history. I now know why it was there. I just regret wasting my time watching it.

The Script:
A confused history lesson delves into campy soap operatic tones that snuff out the more interesting bits.

The Direction:
A total step backward from its grittier 1998 predecessor, Kapur tries to add too much gloss and loses his core along the way.

The Acting:
Clive Owen is a joke, Abbie Cornish can't act, Cate Blanchett is shocking bland and unfocused and Samantha Morton steals the whole show with a handful of scenes (she's amazing).

The Technical:
Some overblown visuals look cheesy and fake, but the costumes are divine and the texture of the set pieces are organic and splendid to look at.

In the end I hope that they stop here.  I loved the 1998 film, and Blanchett in it, but this was a disaster that failed on nearly every level, the Oscar winning costumes aside.",1330905600,,940,4.5266272189349115

Moreover, the absurd portrayal of King Philip II was that of a Darth Vader character saturated in his evil plans.

The propagandistic English historical establishment is the best in the world at manipulation via mindless entertainment, discrediting other nations, diminishing the history of others while inflating their own, and distorting Historical facts. They, along with the Dutch (research the Paper Wars against Spain in the 16th century) have been masters at the art of deception and propaganda for more than 500 years.

3044211,2,B000ZOXDG4,"After viewing this movie, I was greatly disappointed not just by the lack of historical accuracy but also by other things that are important for example the script, the filmography, the plot, the sets and most importantly the lack of action.

In a matter of fact, when I think about it. I'm not exactly sure who is the target audience here, it's not history buffs, nor action lovers or fans of soap operas dramas. I am still confused as to what group of people I would recommend this movie.

I don't normally give a movie 2 stars unless I had to and I tried to see some redeeming qualities to make up for my disappointment and eventually I did somehow for example the boat scene where Elizabeth is sitting with her ladies is beautiful for example albeit inappropriate (historically) for Tudor England and some other brief moments like the Spanish Armada sailing but that's it and quite frankly it wasn't enough to make me change my opinion after almost 2 hours of viewing

Why precisely I give this 2 stars ?

1-Historical Inaccuracies aside (I'll come to these in a moment) the directing was odd and made the film rather confusing. Jump Cuts, shots from odd angles and there was even a scene where Elizabeth was walking with her minsters and the camera decides to shoot that from the ceiling for no apparent reason.

2-The customs, I know they are pretty and the colors are full of life and glee but aside from the ruffs (which aren't even accurate and resemble wires more than fabric) the dresses look more suitable for Venice rather then England. Another thing that bugged me was Cate Blanchette's hair style. While the real Elizabeth undoubtedly wore wigs (not to cover her bald hair like some people think but to cover grey hair and because wigs were in fashion) was it necessary to decorate it with feathers in almost every scene ? She looks like a peacock ! It's impossible.

3-Manners and Behaviors, people didn't behave that way in Elizabethan England, they didn't talk that way either. The Script is very disappointing (I wasn't accepting something out of Shakespeare mind you) but at least something sophisticated enough and still understandable. The actors don't have a chance to shine because the script is so limited. In another scene Elizabeth the Queen is sitting on her throne while one of her ladies-in-waiting who is a dwarf no offense intended is sitting on her lap. Will the real Elizabeth or any Queen for that matter allow her lady in waiting dwarf or not to set on her lab in a public ceremony ? I just had to laugh at how ridicules that scene is! In another scene there is a feast and a group of painted performers came half naked (that wasn't the kind of entertainment at court that scene quite frankly fits more perfectly in Arabian Nights).

4-Historical inaccuracies finally we are getting there !

Elizabeth hated women (she trusted a few, including her governor Kat Ashley who was a mother to her and Dudley's sister who nursed her during small pox as well as another lady in waiting which name escapes me) as for the rest she hated them ! If you don't believe me read any biography about her. She broke a woman's finger once because she married secretly, she imprisoned another in the tower for the same reason, I wouldn't be surprise if she banished others too. She was all vicious to women while all charm to men. She preferred the company of men and was more comfortable with them and didn't make it a secret. So, for her to be running around with her ladies in waiting is untrue. She was a great flirt and surrounded herself with members of the opposite sex.

There are many key figures missing in this movie. Where is Essex ? Where is Cecil ? Where is Drake ? And most importantly where is Robert Dudley ? (Queen Elizabeth's favorite who might or might not be her one true love) all is gone.

By the time of the Armada Elizabeth wasn't entertaining any suitors. She was in her 5os, her ministers already knew she wouldn't get married as the possibility of an heir is no longer valid. Also, Elizabeth might be capable of Political Brutality almost like any other Politician however she was quite shaken by Mary Queen of Scots Execution. Or at least pretended to be Quite Shaken there is no emotion whatsoever shown in here. Even in that Kissing scene between Elizabeth and Raleigh she seems rather stiff while we know that she's a woman of Passion.

Cate Blanchette is an excellent actress but I'm afraid that's not enough to save this movie. The dialogue, the inaccuracies, the gloomy gothic sets that are so dark it's impossible to see who's doing what at times. If you'll watch this film then let it be for pure entertainment not for History please. There is NO History to be learnt here if you want you can always pick a book or use Wikipedia.

For a better adoption watch the Helen Mirren's version Elizabeth 2005. It's more accurate and the script is intelligent and witty.",1316995200,,4915,4.610983981693364

3044214,1,B000ZOXDG4,"It is as if the director were saying ""look at me, look at me, am I not fabulous?"", instead of giving us a truthful movie with a tight well-written story. Practically everything Elizabeth did and said was written down in her own time. It is very easy to follow history and produce a thrilling story about these events, but this director decided to give us lies and dress up the lies in his concept of art. Got news for him--the art lies in story telling, not dressing it up with costumes, dark moody sets, and special effects. Everything here is overdone. Poor writing with unrealistic sappy dialogue and historical lies cannot be saved with expensive (but gaudy) costumes and fancy camera work. The truth in this story would have been far more interesting than this ego-driven director's vision. For instance, did you know that Elizabeth refused to pay many of the sailors who fought and risked their lives to save her royal butt from the Spanish? Many of them died later of diseases and starvation while living in filth, but her royal partying went on.  But if you wish to find far greater evil, read the histories of the Borgia and Medici popes. This movie was long, tedious, poorly scripted, overdone, boring, sappily dialogued, ego-driven, and mostly lies.

A note to the producers, the director, and to screenwriter Michael Hirst: if you've managed to get Cate Blanchett back in the game as Elizabeth, you'd darn well better make sure that you use her.

Following Queen Elizabeth in her middle years this films explores the romance of Sir Walter Raleigh, the Catholic assassination plots, Mary Queen of Scots treason and the Spanish Armada. The costumes and sets are stunning and are the key aspects that really makes this film. Blanchett's performance is as good as the first film (which you don't have to have seen to enjoy this film) and the supporting cast do an ample job at providing the drama and intrigue to the storylines. Clive Owen is especially good as the lovable rogue, Raleigh, and is very credible after seeing him in less impressive roles in other films. The veracity of the history may be in doubt, but the adventure and drama in the story more than make up for this and as long as you are aware of it, this film makes for a couple of hours of good viewing. Worth a try if you enjoyed the first instalment.

3044224,4,B000ZOXDG4,"This movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, as it's dense on politics at times, and gruesome at others. However, for those reviewers who claim this film demonstrates religious bigotry, I beg to differ. Written and visual portraits from this time period reveal that the Spanish did indeed behave and dress the way they appeared in the film. Dour, black-wearing, bearded, somber, and convinced that Elizabeth was an Infidel who deserved to be destroyed. In addition, Philip II's infirmities and strange physique were portrayed as they truly were at the time; the House of Hapsburg and its various branches was becoming so inbred in early modern Europe that many of its members were physically deformed. This is no different than discussing how that the House of Tudor, for whatever physical/genetic reasons, clearly had reduced fertility during Henry VIII's time and afterward -- and saying so is hardly anti-Protestant prejudice. These are historical facts, and histories of the time period make them abundantly clear.

The movie does not try to absolve Elizabeth from all religious prejudice; indeed, it does show her ministers' gruesome vengeance  -- with confessions extracted from torture -- against Catholics suspected of plotting her demise. However, it is important to keep in mind that context of the times, and that the religious wars were brutal across Europe. Compared to the Spanish Inquisition, Elizabethan England was far less violent.

Her reign was also less violent than her father Henry VIII's by far -- he whose rule saw widespread oppression and terrorism against Catholics and Protestants alike, depending on how the religious/political winds were blowing across Europe at any given moment, and given the views and actions of Henry's enemies/allies/wives/lovers of any given moment.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that even the most devout of Catholics of today would still claim that it would have been better for autocratic Spain, which had practically NO democratic tradition, and in which the Inquisition against Protestants, Jews, Muslims, accused heretics, etc. etc. was in full swing, to have conquered England in 1588.... The movie is also very useful in demonstrating how Elizabeth's victories and her enduring rule were in large part a result of her turning herself into a quasi-religious icon for her realm -- something the first film in the series makes even more clear -- and the price she had to pay for that decision. Subtle people will detect the subtleties in the film, and appreciate them. People with a major religious axe to grind, however, probably will not.",1266710400,,2605,5.180522565320665

With covert intrigue, Spain sets a trap for the Queen and her principal secretary, Walsingham, using as a pawn Elizabeth's cousin Mary Stuart, who's under house arrest in the North. The trap springs, and the armada sets sail, to rendezvous with French ground forces and to attack. During these months, the Virgin Queen falls in love with Walter Raleigh, keeping him close to court and away from the sea and America. Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Blanchett is magnificent in her strange, enigmatic and multi-dimensional character, constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counter-plotting to take her down at her Court, in her government, and, from foreign lands. This movie does entertain, sending me on a delightfully exciting spell-bound journey to separate legend and myths from historical facts.

3044226,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I loved the first ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett, and so was eager to see the follow-up.

It doesn't compare.

It is gorgeous in design and costumes.  For the most part the acting is good.  But the plot and the writing are stiff.

Everything is a set piece.  People simply pose, deliver their lines, and swirl away.  This makes the movie curiously static.

There isn't much interaction between characters.  This becomes blatant with Clive Owen.  I have heard Owen declare in an interview that actors don't have to show ""emotion.""  Well, in this one, he certainly doesn't.  He has two expressions: Amused in a Superior Way, and Sternly Serious.  These get old fast, and contribute nothing.  Owen is a kinetic actor like Tom Cruise, and when he is not in motion he is dull, almost embarrassing.

Geoffrey Rush is also wasted in this one.  He puts in his cameos and vanishes.

Worst of all, the plot jigsaw never fits together.  There is a vague suspense theme, involving Mary Stuart and Phillip II, but it is so un-suspenseful that it hardly makes sense.  There is even a suspense underplot, involving the Walsingham brothers, but again, it is limp to the point of sleepy.

3044230,1,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth- the Golden Age"" is a star-studded, well-acted, visually sumptuous cinematic hate crime. Surpassing even the Davinci Code in historical fabrication, coarse stereotypes and anti-Catholic bigotry, ""Elizabeth"" has set a new low in the use of film to demonize, mock and slander a group of people. One would have to go back, perhaps, to ""The Jew Suss"" to see a film that would equal ""Elizabeth"" in religious hatred. Perhaps Shekhar Kapur's next project will be to bring ""Maria Monk"" to the screen.

From the film's introductory assertion that ""Philip II, a devout Catholic, has plunged Europe into war"", educated men will guffaw at the shameless lies this movie tries to have us swallow. The cartoonish, Manichean caricatures that populate this movie are enough to condemn it: weird, cadaverous Spaniards, Jesuit assassins, treasonous Catholics, a creepy Spanish Infanta who plays with an Elizabeth voodoo doll, and a vacant-eyed Philip II who limps about gibbering insanely. On the other hand we have the thoroughly modern Gloriana, the liberated woman and good boss, who indulgently winks at her equally likable subordinates' slip-ups and looks darned saucy in a fabulous wardrobe and a big red wig.

But the sins of this movie don't stop at characterizations that would have been thought shallow in the silent film era. Most shameless of all is the portrayal of Elizabeth as an advocate for freedom and religious tolerance. She is indeed famously recorded as having said that she had ""no desire to make windows into men's souls"". To be sure, a Catholic under the Elizabethan regime was ""free"" to believe whatever he wanted, so long as his faith stayed within the confines of his mind. If he didn't publicly abjure the Pope and the old Faith, worship and live as a Protestant in all externals, and keep his Catholicism completely secret, persecution and death awaited. The fate of St. Edmund Campion discloses, in bloody microcosm, the reality of Catholic life under Elizabeth. Arrested for preaching England's ancient Gospel and administering the Sacraments to England's persecuted Catholic majority, Campion was racked, tortured, hanged to the point of death, disemboweled and castrated while alive, then beheaded and quartered. Such was the vaunted tolerance of Bloody Bess for those who resisted the ersatz, government-issued religion.

Perhaps the current decline and collapse of the practically pagan English ""church"" is yet another proof of the old saying that the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small. The Anglican compromise was an unnatural and insupportable belief system imposed upon an unwilling people, and like all bad ideas, has produced bad fruit: Deism, indifferentism, innumerable sects, naturalism and ultimately atheism. For hundreds of years, and for some inscrutable purpose of God, this alien system was permitted to flourish in England but now seems to be approaching its end. Whither the English go now, to the Faith of their ancestors or down some other path, God only knows.",1261094400,,3031,5.245360824742268
3044231,2,B000ZOXDG4,"This movie has been on my to-view list for too long.  So now, I broke down and rented.
Phillip II raises an army in Spain to attack the Protestant England, ruled by Elizabeth I.  Elizabeth struggles to balance the Catholics and the Protestants in England, and to face off against the Spanish Armada.
The costumes, sets, and scenery are goregous, stunning.  I can't tell you how often I would look at Cate Blanchett and think she was Elizabeth (in her costumes, she looks a lot like the paintings I've seen of Elizabeth I).  The same goes for Samantha Morton as Mary.  Absolutely stunning!
I think Cate did a fair job as Elizabeth, I enjoyed watching Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, and Samantha Morton was excellent as Mary.
As I'm sure you could tell, I had trouble giving a plot to this story.  Much of it seems to revolve around the teenaged antics of Elizabeth falling head over heels for Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), who only has eyes for Bess, the Queen's attendant.  While I am sure that Elizabeth wasn't the portrait of perfection that we receive from history, I got tired of the melodrama of the romantic angle (hence the title of this review).  It feels like a blasted soap opera.  And it interrupts the conflict between Spain and England, making that storyline almost impossible to understand.
And the pacing!  So slow, so boring, so tedious!  So confusing!  All these events...Mary's treason, Sir Francis Walsingham intercepting messages.  It might make sense if it weren't so hidden, so buried underneath the romantic triangle.
Cate Blanchett attempts to do a good job with Elizabeth and she does make the queen appear strong, but at times, she makes Elizabeth too human, whining, complaining in front of her courtiers, in front of the people she's supposed to govern, who are supposed to respect her.  What kind of woman can command admiration to be called the Virgin Queen if she is angsting over Raleigh being with Bess?  Clive Owen is forgettable as Raleigh, Abbie Cornish will never win an award of any kind for her ""performance"" as Bess, and Jordi Moll&agrave; as the Spanish King just cements in our heads that Spain = Bad.
Lastly, historical inaccuracies abound, even to a history dunce such as myself.  Wasn't Mary Elizabeth's sister, not cousin?  Didn't she die before Elizabeth took the throne?  Would Elizabeth really go all Eowyn on us and ride out Theoden style to meet her army?  I understand that movies don't have to be historically accurate 100% of the time, but I can only suspend my disbelief so much.
Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  Perhaps history buffs might be able to glance over the inaccuracies (probably not) or maybe the uninitiated can become interested in the story (if they like romance triangles), but other than that.  I don't know.  But I know how I feel, and I didn't enjoy it.  2 stars for Cate Blanchett's attempts, Geoffrey Rush, and the gorgeous costumes.

3044234,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate Blanchett alone makes this movie fantastic.  Her characterization of Queen Elizabeth is genius - every cell in her body becomes the powerful queen.  Cate Blanchett shows Queen Elizabeth's ability to change ""masks"" -  The queen who holds court shows her intelligence, strength, ruthlessness, yet has a sense of ironic humor.  The queen in private shows her emotions, love, and fears.  There are threats all around her.

Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) appears on the scene and throws his cloak below her feet so she does not step in a puddle.  His dashing ways attract her as someone different from the boring duties of the Court.  He tells of exciting adventures with savages, brings strange exotic items from the New World:  potatoes and tobacco as well as a few Native Americans. her Court.  Sir Walter distracts and intrigues her - makes her weak, she knows her rules  as Queen, yet she needs him near.  He notes that he has named territory after the Virgin Queen ""Virginia.""

She wants to focus on her responsibilities instead of personal matters.  Skullduggery and
treachery is all around.  There are fights on what religion should be practiced - an Armada that carries the Spanish Inquisition is coming to England to crush out the Protestants and make Catholicism the national religion. She depends on her advisor Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to flush out her betrayers.  Her own cousin, Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) is plotting to have Elizabeth assassinated.

Again, Cate Blanchett is riveting as Queen Elizabeth, and the movie revolves around her role.  The movie is excellent and the beautiful costumes, landscapes and sets frame the actress well.",1254700800,,1673,5.065934065934066
3044235,3,B000ZOXDG4,"Here we have a wonderfully produced semi-epic film, with sprawling scenes... film art at its best; however, it really drags in terms of action.

In a more positive defense of the film, if you are really into historically-based movies, I think you'll enjoy this one a great deal. But like similar productions such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becket/dp/B00007G1WH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becket</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-the-Thousand-Days-Mary-Queen-of-Scots/dp/B000RF7XYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, in an effort to accurately convey the tale the details here prey heavily upon the final achievement.

The Story: It's all about the reign of Elizabeth I (1533-1603), daughter of Henry [Tudor] VIII and one of England's most renowned and controversial queens. There's a particular focus on Elizabeth's troubles with both Spain and with the large Catholic population of her country. (Henry VIII had been excommunicated by Pope Clement VII. The King had married the sensual Anne Boleyn, [mother of Elizabeth I] absent the Pope's approval of an annulment from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then Henry subsequently established the Protestant Church of England.) The story also involves Elizabeth's rocky relationship with her Catholic cousin and rival for the British throne, Mary Queen of Scots who was ultimately executed by a malevolent Elizabeth.

I feel additionally compelled to remark that the casting for this movie was near-perfect as were the indoor sets and outdoor locations. For this specific reason, I would especially recommend that you view the movie in its widescreen version on the biggest widescreen television you can find.

In summary, if history is your thing, you'll likely award this 1 hour and 55 minute film four or five stars. If not, you'll probably be bored to tears.

I just wish Hollywood would make a real good movie about this subject without taking sides and portraying both the English and the Spaniards as accurate as possible the way they really were along with the real reasons why the armada campaign came to be.......The real reason for the Spanish Armada wasntareligious e, it was a response from the Spanish to the continous piratical attacks to spanish possessions from english buccaneers backed by Queen Elizabeth.",1244246400,,995,4.824561403508772
3044238,3,B000ZOXDG4,"At once more ambitious and less intriguing than its predecessor, Elizabeth: The Golden Age certainly isn't the abject disaster reviewers claimed on its theatrical release, although it's not nearly as engrossing as the original. Unfortunately, while Shekhar Kapur opens up the action and opts for a much lighter palate this time round, with at least a trailer's worth of striking visuals, the results are not particularly compelling. By focusing on the best-known part of the Virgin Queen's reign there's less of the constant sense of danger that marked its predecessor even though it amps up the threat by pitting her not against her own court but the might of the Spanish Empire and its Armada. Yet, being a sequel, it adheres to the `the same but different,' and there's certainly a strong element of dj vu: the dastardly Catholics are still plotting her death, with Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton taking on the Daniel Craig and Fanny Ardant roles of Jesuit hitman and conspiring Scottish queen. And, as before, history isn't well served, with the film offering the notion that Philip of Spain conspired to force Elizabeth to execute Mary Queen of Scots to give him an excuse for a holy war.

The script certainly could have been better, running down rather than gaining momentum as the Armada approaches and dropping the ball in many of the obvious slamdunks. Certainly if you're going to omit Elizabeth's famous ""I may have the body of a weak and foolish woman, but I have the heart of a king"" you need to come up with something with more guts and bravado than the tired horseback speech she gives to rally her troops. Even worse, the Armada itself is something of an anti-climax. The almost painting-like CGi effects aren't as much a problem in a film as occasionally stylised as this as are the all-too obvious budget limitations that reduce it to the odd running commentary that makes it somewhat akin to listening to a football game on the radio.

Performances are highly variable. Blanchett is suitably regal in the lead, with Geoffrey Rush and David Threlfall fare best among the courtiers, but Abbie Cornish makes little impression, Rhys Ifans just seems to be going through the motions and Samantha Morton is fairly awful as Mary. Both bland and risibly hammy at the same time, with her risibly overemphatic delivery she feels like a smug prefect in a school play playing up to the gallery rather than a credible conspiring monarch, giving easily the worst performance in the film even after the worst of her performance hit the cutting room floor. Yet the biggest surprise in the film is Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh.

If at first it seems disastrous casting the zombie-like Owen as the representation of the life and love Elizabeth can never have, but, amazingly, for once he almost rises to the occasion. Like many a bad actor he's utterly hopeless in the moments that aren't about him, looking bored when he's supposed to be listening, displaying complete disinterest in his scenes with Abbie Cornish and sleepwalking through the battle with the Armada, but for once he handles his monologues - the best writing in the film - surprisingly well, even changing his expression a few times, though quite why he chooses to play his early scenes with a bad American accent remains a mystery. It's not a perfect performance (the deleted scenes on the DVD show that his flat delivery and lack of timing botched a gift of a scene with Rush), but for the first time there are signs that if he was willing to really put in the work and had a director who wouldn't mistake talking in a bored Coventry accent for a performance he could be a capable jobbing supporting actor.

The 1.85:1 widescreen transfer is a bit disappointingly short on detail in some scenes, though there are a decent set of extras.",1241827200,,3806,4.797256097560975
3044239,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Picking up shortly after Elizabeth I left off the movie portrays the complicated life of one of England's greatest Monarchs. Elizabeth The Golden Age, shows us the balance which was required of Elizabeth, balancing the incredible tenacity and guts it took to rule England and her fears and longings for real love and security.

  Elizabeth's life is a story of overcoming the odds. Born second child of Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn, she was supposed the be the long awaited and promised son of the King, yet Henry's wishes for a son were dashed upon her birth. In the first movie we see the growth of her strength which Elizabeth must muster to survive, and in The Golden Age we see the strength come into full bloom, the strength she will need to overcome the looming Spanish evasion and the always present question of marriage and producing a male heir.

  Europe has become divided by Protestant and Catholic, and Elizabeth's own country and family has fallen along divided lines as well. Queen Mary of Scotland sits to the north imprisoned by Elizabeth, but Mary possesses something that Elizabeth does not have, the backing of Catholic Spain and France. For Elizabeth it is only a matter of time until she will be called upon to do something about the looming threat of Mary. When that time comes we find Elizabeth torn between what must be done to a trader and the rights of a sovereign Queen like herself.

  It is this decision which leads to the climax of the movie. Mary is favored by Spain and with the outcome of Mary's fate, Spain steps into action to crush the Protestant [...] Elizabeth. Elizabeth faced with an impeding invasion of the Spanish steps forward to encourage her  countrymen in the battle and protect her beloved England.

  However The Golden Age is not solely about the battles between countries but the battles of the heart. Elizabeth although known as the Virgin Queen is not without the need of love and passion. Yet Elizabeth knows that this could pose as big a threat to her and her country as the Spanish and French.

This film is truly a feast for the eyes - incredible costumes and sets are only the beginning. I would recommend that one watch The Golden Age after first viewing Elizabeth I. It will assist in knowing where Elizabeth has been and the amount of growth in Elizabeth is amazing to watch.",1240272000,,2353,4.6521739130434785
3044240,4,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth,"" the first film, was about a young woman coming to the throne in a period of great turmoil, and how she dealt with that... It was love in the context of power, betrayal, and survival...

In ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" we're dealing with the most famous aspects of her regime, the Spanish Armada, the Babington Plot, which was a major plot against her, and Walter Raleigh bringing back the very early understanding of the New World, and the horizons beyond Britain... It is the exploration of unrestricted power...

Elizabeth, as cultured and as intelligent and eloquent as she was, had never left the shores of England... And into her court, strides an explorer who has literally been where the maps end... The gallant Raleigh (Clive Owen) was a free spirit who thrills the queen with his tales and discoveries at sea ... The classic 16th-century adventurer who doesn't play by any official rules, and he does bring into the world of the court something very alluring, enigmatic and charismatic, which has a big impact on the queen...

The relationship between Raleigh and Elizabeth was very complicated... There were things holding Elizabeth back... ""We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love."" These words were spoken by Sir Walter Raleigh to the Virgin Quenn...It's very rare that the Queen takes interest in a man, and she does...

At this special point, England was very weak militarily... Elizabeth had discharged the navy... And once again it was the old problem of religious instability, which harasses the human race frequently...

Anybody that's interested in this period of history will find it fascinating just how capable Elizabeth was in regards to how she dealt with the captive Queen of Scots...

Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) had great respect for the Protestant Elizabeth, and was remarkably intrigued by her, and desperate to meet her, and fascinated... For several years Elizabeth suffered about her execution because she really believed two things... She believed that any queen was divine... She accepted as true that her Catholic cousin was there by the will of God, and therefore, Mary was there by the will of God... And in executing Mary, she would disintegrate her one belief that she herself was divine...

Mary found it in death... Elizabeth had to find it in life... So if you look at the Armada, Elizabeth finally does become divine, and that's why we had to admire how the scene of the Armada is shot, by Shekhar Kapur, in that way... It's not actually a fiery sea battle between two countries... It's a 'Holy War' with Spain... Therefore, the defining moments of the Armada is when Elizabeth walks up across the verdant cliffs in flowing white nightgown... She's no longer the Avenging Queen... She's instead a supernatural being, a disembodied soul defeating the enemy, dominating the fearless of the waves, the force of the storm, and the strength of fire...

Dripping with intrigues, plots, battles, mysteries, and strong emotions, the film captured the ecclesiastical spaces of the cathedrals to look more like a palace environment... It also captured the feel of the16th century architecture, linking and matching it to the proper locations...",1237075200,,3271,5.0

3044243,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Shekhar Kapur picks where he left off in telling  the story of Elizabeth Tudor in 1998 by presenting his interpretation of the latter half of the Great Gloriana's reign in this 2007 sequel.
  It begins in 1585. Elizabeth has been England's ruler for over a quarter century, and is now 52.
 She deals with threats of  invasion by Spanish King Phillip II(Jordi Molla), her ex-half-brother-in-law, and plots  against her that are a little closer to home by Scottish Queen Mary Stuart(Samantha Morton), her Catholic cousin, whose legitimate claim to the English throne is supported by Spain and Rome, but who arguably overplays her hand in dealing with her cousin.
 Meeting with her council members, her chief advisor Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush)advises her to monitor England's Catholic population more closely. While omitting her famous line, ""I will not make a window on men's and women's souls"", the Queen's(onscreen) actions reveal this. She vows to punish her people only based only on their deeds, not their beliefs (which in reality, didn't happen).
 The story omits  the Queen's most trusted advisor, William Cecil, as well as Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Cecil, and Robert Devereaux, and focuses on her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh (the ruggedly handsome Clive Owen, with radiant charisma, but looking as though he stepped from the canvas of an oil painting), who has just returned from the New World, having named the colony of Virginia in honor of the Virgin Queen, with the bounty of the New World, a few Native Americans, and pirated treasure from Spanish ships in tow.
 One has to overlook many historical inaccuracies to enjoy the performances of the beautifully intelligent Abbie Cornish as the Queen's ward, and most-favored lady-in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, Christian Brassington as the Archduke of Austria ( whose appearance recounts an episode of the storied Queen's life that took place earlier than the 1580s), David Threfall as Royal Astrologer, John Dee, whose prediction  of a war between two Empires, and vaguary surrounding those details troubles Elizabeth, Eddie Redmayne, as Anthony Babington, the Jesuit's recruit to assassinate the English Queen, Rhys Ifans as co-conspirator and envoy to Spain, Robert Reston, and Adam Godley as Francis Walsingham's traitorous brother, William.
 We are led through sundry intrigues, and court rituals, as well as the Queen's dramatic response to a threat by a Spanish Ambassador in which she claims to have  an internal ""hurricane that can strip Spain bare"", before we come to the high drama surrounding the trial and execution of Mary Stuart, an incident which causes Elizabeth much distress and may well have made her re-live the similar scenario involving her own mother, although she may have been too young to remember the latter. Tom Hollander's Sir Amyas Paulet, presides over the Scottish Queen's demise.
  Under the observant eye of his  daughter, the Infanta Isabel (who was actually 21 in 1588, but here is portrayed by child actress Aimee King, decked out like a 16th century Wednesday Addams),a vengeful King Phillip, who supported Mary Stuart, declares Holy War on England. Elizabeth has to forgive Raleigh's seduction of Bess to appoint him as captain of her naval forces.
 The climax of the film is the dramatic confrontation of the Spanish Armada, where Henry VIII's once unwelcome daughter presides over an astonishing victory. The cinematography of this scene is particularly bold.
 Dealing with life and death matters among her closest subjects shortly thereafter, she settles into her role as mother of her people, and helps England close the 16th century on a golden note.
 The acting and the costumes are superb, and I have often felt the best historical dramas are ones that resemble moving oil paintings of the time they depict on canvas. Director Kapur succeeds in creating that effect here.",1234051200,,3893,5.1900958466453675

3044246,3,B000ZOXDG4,"This is indeed a very colorful production and the acting is all pretty good, especially Kate Blanchette.
However it has two main problems
-- First there is the mis-blending of plots and episodes in the movie: Elizabeth's affairs at court with Sir Walter Raleigh shares about the same screen time as does the war with the spanish. But neither get dealt with properly or fully - they get dabbled in ... pity.
I am not sure how accurate the movie is. I honestly don't know but as a general history lesson it brings up interesting stuff about the religious background to spain etc. If it is correct in it's depictions then as a believer in secularism I am glad the spanish armada did not succeed againt England. The church has a lot to answer for in history no doubt. I say that tough I now live in Spain myself and love it to bits.
-- The second problem is the presence of Hollywood - the over-iconiation of Elizabeth is a pain amidst all the continuous background synthesized wall-to-wall dribble music. When will these producers ever learn? With all the classical music available not to mention endless abstract pieces that could have been used, I cannot understand the dullness of mind which the director is guilty of here. This is why this movie will always be a ""B"" flick. What a pity! A bit of simple taste and it might have been a classic. Certainly the stunning visual settings and costumes were all up to it.
I wish Hollywood would learn. Maybe take a page from A Man for all Seasons - pace things on the screen a little bit more rather than bombarding the viewer with this overproduction. Modern technology is great but we need to know when not to apply it.
Especially having spend all the time and money.
Let me give one small example of what I mean: There is a scene at a late stage of the file where the camera rotates a few times round a beautifully crafted doll/statuette of the queen(Kate Blanchette). Really marvelous idea but not at this stage of the story and for so long with all the meaningless background music raging. The film at this stage was boring and the scene served only to irritate this viewer - I just wanted it to end. Why not have this maybe in the opening scene and without the sound assault?!

It's tough to beat a foursome like Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen and Samantha Morton for good acting but - for me,  the star of the film was the photographer. In this case it is Remi Adefarasin. Between his camera-work, the direction of Shekhar Kapur, and the production design by Guy Dyas, this film is a series of pure visual treats.

I'm not one who usually pays much attention to costuming but Queen Elizabeth's attire in this movie is spectacular. A nod to the great costume design efforts of Alexandra Byrne.

Some people complain Elizabeth isn't portrayed as a strong-enough woman in this movie. I'll use a British response for that: ""rubbish."" Not only is she strong, she is shown as human - not some cold-blooded machine, but as someone with feelings like the rest of us. All her emotions - and I mean all - are on display along with inspiring leadership of her country, with the latter's welfare her number one priority.",1227657600,,1145,4.826530612244898
3044252,4,B000ZOXDG4,"In this sequel to Shekhar Kapur's 1998 Elizabeth, The Golden Age addresses Elizabeth's status in 1585, faced with war with Spain and the fate of her cousin, Mary Stuart, ousted from the Scottish throne and seeking Elizabeth's aid in reclaiming her rightful place. While plotting treachery against England, Stuart (Samantha Morton) enjoys the freedom to send secret missives to Spain. And Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla) schemes to deliver the rigors of the Inquisition to England and banish Elizabeth (Kate Blanchett). On a more personal level, Elizabeth is enchanted by an adventurous Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), recently returned from the New World and bursting with ideas for England's expansion across the sea. Unwilling to release the charming Raleigh for a return voyage, Elizabeth increasingly depends upon him to fill the lonely hours of what is a very solitary reign. The ageing Francis Wallsingham (beautifully understated by the always precise Geoffrey Rush) stands guard at the queen's side, delivering the news she is reluctant to entertain, his conscientiousness grown tiresome, but increasingly necessary over the years.

As events unfold, Elizabeth will face two momentous decisions: how to dispose of her blood relative and fellow-queen, Mary Stuart; and how to successfully engage in war with Spain, Philip's armada soon to arrive off the coast of England, far superior to England's maritime efforts. More painful, personally, is Raleigh's betrayal- Elizabeth's handmaiden, Bess, is carrying his child, yet another bitter pill for this beleaguered queen to swallow on her solitary sojourn as queen of England. Despite Blanchett's perfect beauty in this role and her adaptation of a more mature, yet still deeply emotional monarch, the true star of the film is the extravagant cinematography. The plot line is less than stirring, yet I find it impossible to grade this film with less than four stars for its arresting images. Scene after scene captures the essence of an era, perfectly rendered, historically accurate details: Philip stalking through his palace, black-cloaked and followed by chanting monks, the air suffused with light and grace; Elizabeth, alone in her rooms, the castle huge and hollow without the comfort of one who loves more than serves her.

On the precipice of the battle, Elizabeth emerges to rally her troops, the daunting Spanish armada visible off the coast. She is magnificent in silver armor on a white horse, long red tresses streaming down her back, an iconic Joan d' Arc to spur the men to victory in the face of a superior force. While Raleigh directs the English ships, the battle is engaged, the sea eventually filled with the bodies of the vanquished, Spanish Inquisitors, men of God, horses plunging over the sides of ships, weighty crucifixes tumbling into the deep while Elizabeth and Wallsingham rejoice. Silent much of the time, Blanchett rules this role through the force of her personality, leaving no doubt about the queen's terrible choices and brilliant monarchy. Still as a statue, she stands, hands raised to her people, a vision in white, lonely yet unforgettable. I can still see the striking images in this film, a testament to art and cinematography.

I can't believe Elizabeth:The Golden Age did not win best picture. The logistics of the movie must have been a nightmare what with the sets, costumes, wigs, makeup, cinematography,production design,etc.

I like this director's work. He uses the ""God view"" camera-work, we see the characters by hovering over their heads in many shots. I didn't find this distracting, quite the contrary, it was hypnotic, as was the ""artsy"" lighting and camera of whizzing around a holy looking Elizabeth.

I don't know if anyone noticed the possibility that Elizabeth was a lesbian or bi-sexual. She seemed to have a very close relationship with the stunningly gorgeous Bess played by Abbie Cornish whom I'd never seen before. I'm straight, but, omigod, if a pale yellow perfect rosebud could be transformed into a human face, it would be hers! Her face is so beautiful pure and innocent, she'll make you weep. Elizabeth seemed sexually torn between Beth and Raleigh which made it pretty interesting.

The costumes, wigs, makeup, sets, cinematography, and especially the bold music score was a feast! It makes me sick that No Country For Old Men beat this one out at the Oscars! I have a feeling that there's a trilogy here, but if this one did not make a profit, I doubt if we'll get to see how it all turned out. Cate Blanchett OWNS this character!!!

The point was HER - attention focused on her. That's what she expected and craved - demanded.

The movie may not be dynamic - but folks, that's the way life was during that time. (At least this is more believable than the tragic ""Tudor"" series!)

As in the earlier film, also directed by Shekhar Kapur, this picture is filled with of court intrigues, plus a plot by the Spanish Government and Mary Stuart to assassinate the Queen, all of which culminates with a huge sea battle and the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called ""The Virgin Queen"" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.

Elizabeth I, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, is more moderate than her father. The movie continues to create great suspense as we learn more about the latter years of her reign. Her loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, continues to help the monarch to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and Elizabeth is able to check mate all attempts against her.

The extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur added amazing detail to provide authenticity as to the battle between England and Spain, and they build a ship that is half Armada, half British, then PC replicated, providing awesome battle scenes. The architecture and decorations of the time are exquisite, filming where construction is actually taking place, and dressing in period clothing all construction workers, so the reality is magnificent.

In this film we see a monarch that is now experienced but confronting great challenges because her Catholic cousin, Mary Stuart is after her throne and upon her death, Spain sees the opportunity to attack England under the disguise that she has executed an anointed queen. We see the relationship the queen has with Sir Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen, who brings unique gifts from the new discovered lands of Virginia, named in honor of the Queen. His masterful knowledge of the seas provides great insight to Elizabeth during the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

Compare Elizabeth's way too Henryesque battle speech with Will's to see how flaccid this is. Not even poetry with a lower case p.

Too many stories going on simultaneously, each of them plenty sufficient to drive the plot, means that the whole thing becomes a confused and wild mess. But the shame comes in the lost opportunities. The execution of Mary, one of the most bizarre and terrifying events in English history, is really untouched. (Maybe they wanted to keep the Elizabeth as guilty and torn and the Elizabeth unsullied by this.) But for a graphic and visually compelling film such as this, the site of her head dropping from the exectioner's hand would have been rather startling.

And the love stuff, while maybe historically accurate (Raleigh did enjoy the queen's favor to a remarkable degree) just sunk this tale. We know she doesn't get the man, we also know she doesn't seem to want to. Showing her as an emotional and flighty female, while more in line with current sensibilities, just doesn't seem authentic.

The story is oddly vacant and not really accurate, but the visuals are stunning, and you can't help but enjoy the purity of Blanchett's performance.

I rather fear that too many people will take this ""MTV"" account of Elizabeth's life seriously, and that's a shame. It's a bit like reading the Spark Notes to the Golden Age of England, or watching the Mel Gibson version of ""Hamlet."" It's not BAD, but lord knows it's not accurate or deep. You're there for Mel in tights.

The same applies to Clive Owen. Edgy and divinely roguish in his role as Sir Walter Raleigh, he was certainly an eyeful of man candy. Again, his life was not entirely ACCURATE, but in a production such as this, I suppose that's neither here nor there: we are watching for ENTERTAINMENT.

If I really wanted ACCURACY, I'd watch the History Channel.

The costumes were beautifully done; the landscapes were gorgeous. Again, Blanchett MADE the movie worthy of attention, along with the cinematography and rich colors from artful contrasts and allusions.

I can't stop praising Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth. It is rich and complex, highlighting the solitude of a woman in power and trying to maintain her own against a male-dominated society and Houses. A society where her virginity is her biggest gambling chip against other countries. It was simply a brilliant portrayal!

I enjoyed this movie for what it was: ""BASED"" on the life of Elizabeth I. As we all know, that gives them license to ""elaborate."" (Although, they just... well... snipped the tip of that time period.)

A young queen is torn between her country and allowing herself to fall in love or be loved.  Focusing on her country at a time when her throne and people need her undivided attention is an intense, bittersweet glance into another Era.  When Elizabeth is tricked into allowing her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scotland, to be sentenced to death and beheaded, Elizabeth's spirit and ability to face and fight the mighty Armada of Spain are fully tested.

3044282,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I adored the first Elizabeth. It was perfect in it's script and flawless in it's acting. After watching The Golden Age however, I was utterly distraught. I cannot believe that this is made by the same man who directed the first film. It just doesn't seem possible.
Everything from the script, to the editing to the actors that don't belong, it just doesn't work or flow. If there is one redeaming aspect of this film, it is the once again brilliant performance by Cate Blanchette. She can do no wrong. She is one of the most skilled actresses out there, anywhere. However, my gripe is actually with her character. She doesn't even seem to be the same Queen from the first Elizabeth. Granted, years have passed, but this Elizabeth comes off as weak and undecided, jittery even. It doesn't feel right. Abbie Cornish also feels very wrong as the Queen's favorite lady-in-waiting. She is very out of place, no matter the beautiful costume she is wearing.

Samantha Morton as Mary Stewart is UTTERLY wasted. They could have just cast some unknown, so small and barely noticable a part she played. One of my favorite actors, Geoffry Rush was shamefully placed in the background and barely had anything to do with this film. His character was a favorite of mine in the first film.
Clive Owen is pointless in this. His character feels neither here nor there. Wrong choice in actors, I guess.

The plot was also confusing, it jumped around way too much and you never really know how much time has passed. There is no mystery or intrigue. Nothing to captivate. The final and supposedly huge battle is a few boring minutes long and feels almost out of place.

The costumes and wigs are magnificent, as in the first film.  Again, one of the only bright spots.

This is an extrememly dissapointing film that probably should not have been made. It seems very unnecessary. This is definitely one of the instances where a sequel is so much worse than the original.",1213920000,,1948,4.684210526315789
3044283,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Okay, so I'm a little impartial; I'm a huge Cate Blanchett fan and also love historical movies. That being said I think this is a great movie, and even better than the first. There has been a lot of criticism that the film is not historically accurate, and while that may be true, it is called historical fiction for a reason; if you're looking for a documentary on Elizabeth I, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth-The-Acclaimed-Saga-of-England-s-Virgin-Queen/dp/B000065Q9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth: The Acclaimed Saga of England's Virgin Queen</a>&nbsp;produced by the History Channel. Some people have said this movie is only good for eye candy and that the plot is incidental and weak, that it isn't complex or motivate the viewer to think. While I don't necessarily disagree with this opinion, I would argue that there are at least two types of cinematic styles that can make a film extraordinary. The first is the intellectual type that requires abstract thinking, attention to detail and a good memory, the type of film that when all the pieces fall into place it seems almost like an epiphany. The second type of extraordinary film is one that is poignant, sensuous, ecstatogenic and fills one with exaltation. Elizabeth - The Golden Age is the latter type of film. It truly is sublime in the Romantic sense; attempting to analyze, interpret, and dissect this film will all cause you to miss the point! One can only appreciate the sublime when one ceases to try to comprehend, label, and order it; you can only stand in awe of it and allow it to overwhelm you. This is not to say that one type of film is better than the other, simply that they cannot be appreciated in the same manner. Think of the joy the first time you solved a complex equation or suddenly grasped a complex scientific theory; this is analogous to appreciation of a highly complex detail oriented film. Now think of the first time you heard Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy""; you certainly wouldn't have been able to appreciate it if you had approached it in the same analytical fashion as say, the Golden Ratio. So, try to approach this film on its own terms, and you won't be disappointed.",1213747200,,2239,5.054054054054054
3044284,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Long anticipated part three of the Queeen Elizabeth trilogy is finally out there with beautiful Kate Blanchett in the lead role.  Film focuses on the time in British history when Spain, the most powerful country in Europe, attempts to invade Britain in the name of the Catholic faith.  The premise film makes is that Spanish are using Mary, Queen of Scotland, as a bait for Elizabeth to give Spain a reason for invasion.  Important favorite at that time of Elizabeth's reign is Sir Walter Raleigh, who ends up marrying her favorite lady-in-waiting Bess.  Film attempts to cover many aspects of that time: clash between catholic and protestant faith, conflict between liberty and inquisition, Elizabeth's internal struggle between her duty as a queen to her country and her own need for love and loyalty of the man. One constant about all films about this fascinating queen is that she was strong, wise and dedicated ot her service toher people.  Her sense of duty and leadership overrode principal requirement of the time - to marry another prince and create political alliance with another strong European royal powerhouse.  She has managed to deliver prosperity to England and help protestanism establish its roots there.  She has redefined history as a woman, ruler and a political figure of her time who was able to control church, her court and her royal subjects with her wit alone.  However, the full acting credit in this film should go to Samantha Morton in her role of Queen Mary.

3044287,4,B000ZOXDG4,"to me, cate blanchett is one of ten english-speaking actresses that could croak the abcs and i would buy a ticket for it. so, i didn't find my way to 'elizabeth: the golden age' for a history lesson.  likewise, i'm not an anglophile and have some feeling that the english have done some really funky things in the name of their queen.  but that aside, i have nothing but admiration for blanchett's second take on the virgin queen under kapur's fanciful direction.

blanchett and kapur made their chapters in the queen's life a romantic, lush film with hints of political intrigue accompanied by stunning visual and design effects (the watching eyes of the ladies in waiting as elizabeth and sir dudley make love turning in to prints of eyes on her drapes is still so wist ful and enchanting).  kapur was also able to give screen time to more than a few actors like daniel craig.  craig is now the british flavor du jour.  not to mention kelly macdonald and emily mortimer as two of elizabeth's ladies in waiting and the wonderful kathy burke as queen mary.

now the visuals are just as stunning--and from what i gather as anachronistic--as before.  alexandra byrne's costumes are even more sumptuous than before and very worthy of their academy award.  and geoffrey rush is on hand again as elizabeth's advisor and he is even more authoritative.

and as for cate--she is just as magnificent as she was before.  now she is power incarnate as she presses through the cavernous sets in her array of silks and brocades.  and she has more than a few moments of vulnerability as she watches her favorite lady bess dance with her favorite lord, sir walter raleigh and relives when she was younger.  her last night talks with her lady bess are also warm and filled with many depths.

now i wish that the score could have been a little more right and less a wash of strings and whatnot that make up the standard historical epic score.  and even though it may or may not be a huge part of british history, i would like to have seen more of samantha morton.  after all, she is a very good actor and mary, queen of scots is a very good role.

it would have been too much to expect blanchett to take many (if any) awards for this performance but the work still stands strong--even if it's not buoyed up by statuettes.",1211587200,,2304,4.526570048309178

First we are treated to Elizabeth's problems with Mary Stuart, then her relationshop with Walter Raleigh (an excellent Clive Owen) and then the struggle with Prince Phillip of Spain to maintain diplomacy which culminates in war. In comparison to the original, there was a distinct point of view but in this sequel, everything is scattered with a lack of focus. The 3 stars I give this to are the superb HD DVD transfer, Blanchette's performance and of course the battle scenes.  This is disc you would need to show off the virtues of HI-DEF!!

3044291,3,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is a continuation of the life and loves of Queen Elizabeth I of England as portrayed by Cate Blanchett and directed by Shekhar Kapur. The first ""Elizabeth"" was a perfectly watchable costume drama, but never quite made it to excellence. The sequel leaves more to be desired.

Familiar themes from the first movie remain a source of contention for Elizabeth. Religious strife threatens to rip the country in half and Europe teeters on war. Elizabeth, despite the advice of spymaster Sir Walshingham (once again played by the great Geoffrey Rush) takes a restrained approach to dealing with the English Catholics. Less restrained is she in the affairs of the heart when the dashing Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) returns from plundering the Spanish. Plunder is a dish best served with potatoes. (Just watch it ...)

Of course, when devout religious believers, politics, and a megalomaniac monarch meet, things get a little dicey. King Philip of Spain, under the pretext of avenging the execution of Mary Stuart (history is a little distorted here) launches his massive Armada to England, but is defeated by a storm.

The film lacks the emotional depth and lacks pathos for the character. Also, the defeat of the Armada completely lacks any sense of urgency or desperation that the English must have felt.

The film deals with the Virgin Queen's relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh, while King Philip II of Spain amasses a massive armada to destroy Elizabeth, and replace her on the throne with Mary, Queen of Scots.
While the film does take dramatic license with historical events, it is a moving, powerful portrayal of the life and times of Elizabeth I. Blanchett is once again fantastic as Elizabeth, while Clive Owen is great as Raleigh. Samantha Morton (Mary), Geoffrey Rush (Walsingham) and Jordi Moll (Philip II) give strong supporting performances. While the story itself is a bit slow during the first half, it picks up in the second half, with fantastic visual effects and action creating a powerful reenactment of the fight with the Spanish Armada off the British Coast.
If you enjoyed the original ""Elizabeth,"" then you will find equal enjoyment out of ""The Golden Age."" But if you haven't seen the first film, you'll be sure to enjoy this film all the same.

3044301,3,B000ZOXDG4,"Elizabeth I is considered by many to be among the most significant and fascinating monarchs to ever walk the earth.  She is also regarded as among the most beloved as well.  To create a lush and dramatic series of films about her long and storied rule is by no means unexpected, nor is it very original as the amount of on-screen interpretations of Elizabeth directly reflects the fascination we have in pondering the meaning of her reign.  Elizabeth:  The Golden Age is Shekhar Kapur's sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth/dp/B000RF7XYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth</a>, a film that introduced us to the famous queen and showed us the first part of her reign.  It's funny, I've been watching Showtime's the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors/dp/B000XV6VOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors</a>&nbsp;and the most recent episodes have shown us Elizabeth's birth and even a little bit about Mary I, the queen that proceeded her and the daughter of Catherine of Aragon .  Given the nature of the hedonistic protagonists Anne Bolyn and King Henry VIII on that show and its positive portrayal of victimized Catholics such as Saint Thomas More, it was quite refreshing to see the Catholic Church in the interrogation room once again, perhaps where it belongs.  Anyway, the significance in the quasi-history portrayed on both this film and that show compliment each other quite nicely as Spain during the second half of Elizabeth's rule was an absolute god-fearing behemoth and a force to be reckoned with.  Some people have said this film is Anti-Catholic but really, these are the days of the inquisition we're watching.  It might be a task to stay balanced.

Elizabeth is fundamentally very easy to sympathize with, after all it isn't really her fault her father was a pervert and her mother his mistress.  Nevertheless, Cate Blanchett has so much range that her performance quietly shows us her less obvious flaws.  I'm convinced that no other actress could portray this queen in a way that justifies her reputation.  The cast is actually great even beyond her though, which is not unlike the first film.  Walter Raleigh is played by Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush is Francis Walsingham and Mary, Queen of Scots is played with great villainy by Samantha Morton.  The film follows the Battle of Gravelines in the Anglo-Spanish War as it's primary battle scene but most of the film is focused on the amazing costumes, music, and sets.  It also ponders Elizabeth's interpersonal relationships.

There are massive historical inaccuracies that are for the most part done to heighten drama but some are pretty inexplicable (where the hell was Robert Cecil?).  I guess the inaccuracies would be inconsequential if I didn't also believe that 99% of the audience would see The Golden Age as their only reference to the virgin queen.  I'm not so sure I can forgive that but I know many viewers will.  Elizabeth's famous speech to the troops at Tilbury before the invasion of the Spanish Armada is widely documented but for those who don't know it is regarded as fact, the scene comes off as derivative of just about every Hollywood epic period film made in the last twenty years.  Blanchett is not at fault but her plate armor and lack of femininity in the way the scene is directed actually brought back the long forgotten memories of Milla Jovovich's speech as Joan of Arc in the pathetically amateur Luc Besson film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Messenger-The-Story-of-Joan-of-Arc/dp/0767845722/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc</a>.  That isn't to say The Golden Age is as bad a film, it is not.  It captures the magic expected of a portrayal of this leader in flashes but misses the opportunity to capture her most significant speech.  They actually blew it.

Anyway, very good looking film with some really great acting, but take heed; the history buffs might take issue with the accuracy, while the movie buffs might mistakenly walk out thinking they've learned something.  I'd like to consider myself a little bit of both so consider this a mixed review leaning toward a partial recommendation for the visuals and performances.",1208131200,,4320,5.400894187779434

In walks the adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh, which does turn Elizabeth's head.  He wants to continue exploring the new world, but needs the Queen's sponsorship.  Unfortunately, her romantic dreams of him don't quite work out.  But she does get Virginia named after her.

Many movies have shown bits and pieces of Elizabeth before with Betty Davis being one of the best, but this rivals even her magnificent classic version.  I highly recommend you catch this visual treat with substance. The movie centers on Protestant Elizabeth dealing with the Catholic King Philip II of Spain. His Inquisition is sweeping Europe and threatens the freedoms of all, including the English. Spain plots war with the assistance of the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots. Some magnifcent scenes including the battle in the English Channel with the Spanish Armada make it a feast for the eyes.

Cate Blanchett brings off the disjunctions masterfully and with amazing imagination.  Geoffrey Rush is subtle and surprizing.  Elizabeth and Walsingham, Walter Raleigh and Henry IV of Spain!--there are few more fascinating characters.

I could find nothing wrong with the story.  I did a little research after watching and found that it is pretty close to truth.  Elizabeth did, for example, send Raleigh to the tower out of jealousy.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada had a lot to do with the inexperience of the Spanish command, but then, it was miraculous too.  I enjoy the ideas at play, the tensions between renown and isolation, authority and individuality, reason and coercion, between open and closed societies.  This is a script with some substance.

It is a dramatized episodic biography.  It is similar in form to movies like ""Ghandi"" and ""Laurence of Arabia"".  This series has similar appropriate sorts of pay off.

3044309,5,B000ZOXDG4,"First the table is set for us. England is in trouble. Spain rules supreme with a vastly superior navy, The Spanish Armada. Phillip of Spain in a fanatical despot. A Catholic obcessed with destroying Elizabeth, the ""bastard queen"" who is by the way, Protestant. That alone didn't set her apart. It was her williness to allow her subjects to worship as they wished, a very radical notion at the time. By 1585, Elizabeth is middle-aged & probably not going to marry or have an heir. But she is still a woman & Sir Walter Raleigh comes into her life. He is a privateer, an adventerer, good-looking & cool as hell. He entertains her with stories of the new world which he has visited, claimed & named for her... Virginia. She falls for him & commands he stay. He tires of court life & desires to return to sea. Eventually, he takes up with Elizabeth's favorite Lady-in-waiting, Bess. Sir Walter impregnates & marries her, in that order, apparently. This of course enrages the Queen. Soon however there are more important things to deal with. She had been forced by her advisors to execute her cousin(?) Mary, Queen of Scots,  a Catholic claiming she is the rightful queen. The Spanish Armada is coming with troops to invade England. Elizabeth, looking very butch in her armour,
addreses her troops who are to defend England. But they don't have to.
Shortly, a storm intervenes, destroying the Armada & Phillip's dreams.
  The tone of this movie was somewhat lighter than the first. Just the ligther colors & sprit conveyed the idea that Elizabeth had coosolidated her power, which was absolute. Perhaps the best years of her reign. If you like history, you'll  appreciate this effort. However accurate it is much of it is historical fact. Considering we are looking back over 400 years it is really excellent. Forget that it is history, if you must. It is still a pretty good story.",1206489600,,1877,4.730886850152905

The Golden Age is poorly written, badly acted and predictable. It does not deserve to be equated to March or Die.  It is as inane as Ishtar. Blanchett, Rush, etc. play the same predictable roles as in any piece of this genre. It is hackneyed and trite.

However, Cate Blanchet continues to embody the powerful part of Queen Elizabeth I.  The movie ran on with scenes that had no build up of how they came to be.

3044319,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate Blanchett is spectacular as Queen Elizabeth I.  The film is loaded with style, story, history and a magnificent splendor not seen of late.
Admittedly, it is a triffle difficult task to create a film that is altogether historic, accurate, precise in detail and entertaining for those who don't appreciate the history and accuracy and detail.  Some detail must be left on the cutting room floor and a broad brush must therefore paint the intricate picture of who's who and whyfore.  But this film is balanced in this regard, almost perfectly balanced in this regard.
It is an art film to be sure, and a beautiful masterful art film at that.  Geoffrey Rush as the senior advisor and confident of the queen, is reprised in the role of Francis Wallsingham, the eyes and ears of all things secret.  Clive Owen is very good as Walter Raleigh, perhaps a bit much of a romantic than historical, but placed well within the story line and effective as an element of cohesion between the plots and the actual events.  Cate Blanchett is the greatest actress since Bette Davis and a true 'star' of the screen.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth is breathless perfection.  One is immediately endeared to the queen in both as a part of history and as a deep person of greatest inner strength and womanhood.  (Bette Davis and Cate Blanchett played the same role, years apart, and both are supreme.)

The digital effects are necessary and beautifully accomplished, yet not overdone as in most epic films.  The scene near the end where Elizabeth is standing upon a rock at the sea's edge watching the destruction of the Armada ranks with the best in any film of any time.

I would love to see a third film someday about the reign of the queen in later years with Cate Blanchett in the role.  I would never tire of seeing her.

Excellent, supreme masterpiece this is that the entire family could enjoy.  Any violence is non-gratuitous and germaine to the story.  It is a clean film by today's standards.  It is a love story yes, but more of a story of courage and determination to overcome fear and prevail in the face of what could have been certain destruction for England.",1205366400,,2153,4.6534391534391535
3044320,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I loved the first movie, Elizabeth.  The Golden Age, however, does not live up to my hopes of a solid sequel.  Though it shares the same general look as its predacessor and some continuity of the characters and their personal story lines, it is much less polished.  Though the love Elizabeth had for Bess was evident, I did not feel any believable chemistry between Elizabeth and Walter.  Cate Blanchett is a great actress but I felt the movie was cut in such a way that the queen appears to be a flurry of emotion shifting in every which direction and hardly having the time for it to soak-in between frames. The scenes needed to be longer or else more cleverly melded together to build the appropriate tension and further develop the characters.  The gory scenes only appeared to add to the problem of time - taking precious minutes away from what would have drawn me more into the plot.  It was frustrating to watch this movie after the masterpiece that came before it.",1205193600,,972,4.589595375722543

But there's no center to this film, no evidence that any thought went into it at all. To borrow a bit more from the Bard himself, while there's lots of sound and fury, it signifies nothing.",1205193600,,479,4.783132530120482
3044322,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I wonder: why do filmmakers bother to tackle an historical subject, if they are intent on changing so much of the facts that the result bears only a vague resemblance to what actually happened? What's the point? Why not simply revert to fantasy altogether? In this film about Queen Elizabeth I's ""golden age"", the time around the Armada attack of 1588, maybe the most surprising thing is the choice of protagonists. One gets the impression Francis Walsingham and Walter Raleigh were the two dominant forces in the Queen's life, which in fact they weren't by a long shot. Her most influential advisor and mentor, William Cecil, doesn't even appear on the cast list, and nor do the Earls of Leicester and Essex, who both ranked much higher on her list of favourites than Raleigh ever did. The latter character is turned into a swashbuckling hero, while in real life he was a vain and arrogant coxcomb, who wouldn't have dreamed to show himself in the slightly shabby, unvaried costume Clive Owen has to make do with - on the contrary, he loved expensive clothes and jewelry. He was also deeply unpopular at court.

The Raleigh in this film is actually a conflation of Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake. It was the latter who brought the potatoe to England and who spent a great deal of time at sea. It was Drake, too, who vanquished the Armada, and though that is in the film, the notion of Raleigh being aboard and Drake seeking his advice is patently absurd. As is the idea of Elizabeth watching the burning ships from Tilbury, for the fleet engaged in battle in front of the French coast, not the English. Nor would she have seen so much flame: the fire ships scared off and dispersed the Spanish, but only one of their ships was actually burnt. And as for Tilbury: why do we get such a botched version of Elizabeth's celebrated speech? Even its most famous line (""I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman..."") is not in the film.

Fortunately, the dealings with Mary, Queen of Scots are depicted somewhat more accurately, that is, if we forget that Mary would have had a French, not a Scottish accent and that Fotheringay wasn't set in majestic highland scenery but in the Northamptonshire flatlands. We get a good sense of the devious, scheming man Walsingham was - the J. Edgar Hoover of his day. Of course, Mary's exact role in the plot has never been established beyond doubt the way it seems here, but the interpretation is defensible. However, Walsingham's brother William, supposedly embroiled in the catholic plot, is entirely fictional: Francis was an only son. It's a far-fetched invention to add some psychological drama to Walsingham's character, something that might have been better achieved through a decent script. The scene where Elizabeth is held at gunpoint by Babington is another flight of fancy that relegates this film to the realm of Narnia and Lord of the Rings rather than that of historical drama.

The main redeeming feature is Cate Blanchett's portrayal of the Queen herself. In its perfect combination of humanity, pride, temperament and regal dignity it seems closer to the real Elizabeth than others have ever come; one is made to understand why the English people worshipped her like a half-goddess (and made to forget that at the time of the Armada the Queen was actually a woman of 55; her teeth would most likely have been black. The makers themselves seem confused about her age, having her considering suitors and talking about her fertility). Blanchett's performance is helped in no small way by the terrific costumes, which exuberantly reflect Elizabeth's extravagant taste in dress. In general the film looks gorgeous. It is strange though, and rather absurd, that while the era of this Queen produced a great number of magnificent palaces in a style even named after her, the filmmakers insist on having her live inside Wells cathedral (we get a single, nighttime glimpse of a great Elizabethan house, Burghley, which is apparently where Dr. Dee lives!). The gothic entourage, decorative as it may be, is entirely out of style.

This film is quite different from the earlier one about Elizabeth's rise to the throne, both in style and accuracy. In both regards, the earlier instalment has the edge. This one can be watched for the eyecandy and Cate Blanchett, and as such is enjoyable enough, but as historical drama it is way off.",1205020800,,4383,4.809018567639257

Elizbeth's want as a woman and duty as a Queen is evident throughout this story. As she pushes Bess towards Sir Walter, she flashbacks to her own lost youth. I was surpised to learn that Sir Walter Raleigh was indeed, secretly married to one of her ladies-in-waiting. I do think however, much liberty was taken in the telling of this 'romantic' tale. The costumes are amazing, the story entertaining and acting first rate. England never looked better than when those Spanish ships were sinking and Liz was on the hill looking like the mighty warrior.",1204934400,,704,4.778688524590164
3044324,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I wanted to see this film when it was in the theatres, but it seemed it was gone in the blink of an eye. Having watched this long-awaited DVD, I can see why it had a short run.

I loved the prequel, ""Elizabeth"", and had eagerly looked forward to this sequel. Upon viewing it, I was a tad disappointed.  It totally omits a pivotal character, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, the man who was Elizabeth's confidante and played a vital role in the events of the day. Instead, the screenplay chooses to focus on a supposed romance between Sir Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth, which plays itself out against the backdrop of a serious threat of war with Spain. Unfortunately, this supposed romance simply does not ring true, striking a false note, and therein lies the rub. The screenplay was poorly written, and the film came across as choppy and poorly edited. Consequently, unless one is familiar with the historical events of the day, the viewer might find the plot confusing. On the plus side, the costumes, the sets, and, above all, the acting were magnificent.

Cate Blanchett, as always, is terrific as Elizabeth, although she looked like a woman in her thirties rather than one supposedly in her fifties, which has a somewhat jarring effect. Geoffrey Rush is once again excellent in the role of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spymaster. Clyde Owen makes for a very virile and dashing Sir Walter Raleigh, while Abbie Cornish is delightful as Elizabeth ""Bess"" Throckmorton, the Queen's lady-in-waiting and Raleigh's true love.

While I love period films, I would recommend that one rent, rather than buy, this DVD.  Although I enjoyed the film, somewhat, I was torn between awarding it three or four stars. In the end, however, the crappy script overwhelmed the efforts of its stellar cast. I only hope that if there is to be another sequel that the script rises to the level of the talented cast.

3044326,3,B000ZOXDG4,"The Good Things:
-Looks historically/culturally accurate.
-Pretty good filming style with lots of good-looking shots.
-Excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth (would be comparable to Helen Mirren's performance in ""Elizabeth I"").  Very deep, complex, and moving.
-Clive Owen is in it, and does okay for himself.
-Strong symbolism...I think...

The Bad Things:
-Action scenes are brief.
-Some parts are confusing unless you pay close enough attention.
-Some parts were shot through glass or veils, creating some wierd images (although this could also be a good thing, because it is visually mesmerizing).
-Action scenes are very brief; particuarly dissapointing for seeing the Spanish armada being wiped out.

As a historical drama, this one works quite well.  It has a good style with lots of strong, memorable visuals.  Queen Elizabeth's character stands out tremendously well, and the other characters are not bad either.  However, this is not like watching ""Braveheart"" or anything; there are very few action scenes, and they are brief.  This is a film to see more for the artistic value, history, characters, and emotions, not for battles.

This is the sequel to the 1998 film ""Elizabeth,"" which also had Cate Blanchett, but one could watch this one on its own (the previous one dealt with the earlier stage of her life).",1204675200,,1323,5.23696682464455
3044327,3,B000ZOXDG4,"There is something stubbornly old-fashioned about Shekhar Kapur's 2007 sequel to his 1998 art-house triumph,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth/dp/B000RF7XYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth</a>. I don't mean the newer movie is a stodgy historical pageant. Far from it, all the production values are first-rate, including a relatively seamless use of CGI in the Spanish Armada sequence, but beyond all the pomp and circumstance, the mindset of the story is pure 1940's-era studio melodrama. Set in 1585, the film picks up the Queen's life a quarter century after the first film, and what follows in the strangely cautious screenplay by Michael Hirst and William Nicholson is a simplistic portrait of an aging, superstitious woman aware of her power but ironically at a loss to define her own fate. This period of her life is familiar from a number of previous films and miniseries, but this time, the psychological complexity behind such a fascinating historical figure has been downgraded in favor of romance novel plot turns and paper-thin character development.

The set-up is rich with possibilities only partially realized onscreen. Protestant England is on its knees, as Roman Catholic Spain has become Europe's most powerful country. Now in her early fifties, Elizabeth is vulnerable since Phillip II of Spain is intent on conquering England and especially because she has not married and produced an heir. Next in line is her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, a devout Roman Catholic imprisoned in a castle in Northamptonshire. Elizabeth has proven to be a tolerant ruler as she allows her country's Roman Catholics to maintain their religious beliefs, even though they see Mary as the only rightful Queen. In the meantime, Sir Walter Raleigh has just returned from the New World and stimulated Elizabeth's passion for adventure and her long-dormant desire for romance. Complicating matters is Elizabeth's devoted lady-in-waiting, Bess, a comely beauty who attracts Raleigh's attention. Just as this standard triangle is established, there is a threat on Elizabeth's life known historically as the Babington Plot. Mary is beheaded for her connection to the plot, which gives Philip free rein to gain the Pope's approval to attack England. Elizabeth inspires her troops to face off with the much larger Spanish Armada, and the rest, as they say, is history.

It's no surprise that Cate Blanchett commands the screen in the title role and does her best to fill in the blanks left by the routine script. She manages to imbue the Queen with a hidden vulnerability at which comparatively imperious predecessors like Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson merely hint. The one drawback is that she is too young for the role, a point emphasized by the periodic and somewhat conceited use of flashbacks from the previous film in which her appearance has not changed significantly despite the make-up. Geoffrey Rush returns from the first film as Elizabeth's advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham, but he has less to do this time. As Raleigh, Clive Owen has no problem playing a dashing figure, but he seems more like a romantic's fabrication of what a bodice-ripping swashbuckler should be. Speaking with a strange burr, Samantha Morton has precious few scenes as the fanatical but forgiving Mary, and her pouty face and petulant manner seem at odds with previous characterizations. As Philip, Jordi Moll is forced to play the king as a religious zealot, while Abbie Cornish's Bess strikes me as far too contemporary in manner to be credible as a lady-in-waiting, especially with the ongoing hints of lesbianism and a soft porn-like lovemaking scene with Raleigh.

Guy Dyas' production design, Alexandra Byrne's costumes and Remi Adefarasin's cinematography are all impressive in their splendor and meticulous detail, though I found the music by Craig Armstrong and A.R. Rahman far too intrusive. There are several extras with the 2008 DVD release starting with Kapur's commentary track, often insightful but excessively verbose. An eleven-minute making-of featurette is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film. Three other shorts are included - one on Dyas' intensive work on the production design, one on the recreation of the climactic battle with a mix of ship replicas and CGI, and one on the actual locations used for the filming. There are nine minutes of deleted and extended scenes including one that too-realistically shows Mary's decapitated head. None of these extras helps make the experience of watching this film any more involving.",1204675200,,4649,5.365753424657535

And I thought I could only love Charlize Theron, one of the most beautiful women to ever appear on a movie screen!!! Of course I do have somewhat of a crush on Scarlett Johannson, but don't tell Charlize that. But I digress. Throughout ""Lizzie Two"" most of the cast seemed to be sleepwalking. Clive Owen's portrayal was particularly boring. Errol Flynn would've certainly been much better in the role, but alas and alack, he is no longer with us! The battle scene with the Spanish Armada was really dull and pretty much anti-climactic. And oh, those seemingly endless ""big lighting"" effects with Elizabeth. Maybe this should have been titled ""Elizabeth, The Savior Queen"". I think Kapur should've reviewed some of the period pieces from the 30's and 40's. They usually had the required dash and panache that this one lacks. And what was with all those real high shots? Were they supposed to impress us little people? Some directors just fall in love with themselves after a dash of success. George Lucas' Star War series comes to mind. I gave this two stars only because it is still a cut above Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"", the epitomy of a bad ""historical"" movie. Was Mel already on the ""sauce"" when he made that one? (By the way, I really like Mel's ""We Were Soldiers"", just so you don't think I'm anti-Mel.) Some of these folks in the movie business must have a very low opinion of our intelligence. (Do ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" come to mind?) My other pet peeve about this movie and some others concerns the dialogue. Whatever happened to recording the characters dialogue in a clear, distinct manner. Actors should never be speaking whilst turned away from the camera. And I do have a good sound system in my home. About $4,000.00 worth. I get tired of going back over the same line two or three times trying to understand what is being said!!!

Mostly, I missed Sir Francis Drake. It was weird having the Spanish Armada without him being called away from playing bowls. And there was hardly any discussion of the fire ships and singeing the King of Spain's beard at Cadiz. It is even  more odd when you think that there are so many plays and histories and even science fiction (Dr. Who) that could have provided inspiration (not to say incident). Then, too, this was the age of the most glorious English poetry and prose -- instead we had uninspired dialogs indoors, telling not showing, and long long intervals of  silence.

3044338,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Loosely based on historical occurences, ""Elizabeth - The Golden Age"" is nonetheless a feast for the eyes.  Excellent cinematography and photography are just icing on a cake of superb acting.  Cate Blanchet, Clive Owen and Geoffrey Rush are as excellent as ever in this continuation of Kapur's version of the story of Elizabeth I of England.

In 1585 Elizabeth I turned 53 years of age, and young looking Cate (though mentioning increasing lines in the film) throws back us nerdy history majors who enjoy a good Tudor story.  Elizabeth faces two challenges - Mary Queen of Scotts and Spanish Armada.  The film, like the first one, was filled with intrigue and romanticized versions of Elizabeth's relationships.  There, of course, are accuracies, and I find it funny that some reviewers balk at a historically accurate part of the film.

One of those was the scene in which Elizabeth rides on her horse in her armor to speak to her troops just before the Spanish Armada.  One reviewer called it ""a cheap rip-off of Braveheart.""  In all actuality, Elizabeth did do this, and Kapur did not even include the biggest (and most oft quoted part) of her speech:""I may have a body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have a heart and stomach of a King, and of a King of England, too.""  I wish that Kapur added that part.  Another bit I wish Kapur (who seems set on the dramatic) included, purely for increasing the dramatic by using historically accurate, is the fact that the executioner had to hit Mary Queen of Scotts' neck twice in order to sever the head.  After beheading, Mary's wig fell off as her head rolled on the floor, exposing wispy white hair of a once beautiful woman, resulting in an undignified death for a dignified monarch, who went to her death with her head held high.

Clive Owen does an excellent job as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Geoffrey Rush shines as Sir Francis Walsingham.  In fact, the entire cast is stellar and they fully carry the somewhat rushed film, helped by stunning photography.  Musical pieces used in the first Elizabeth helped connect with that film.  Kapur is planning on doing a third Elizabeth film.  Although mostly historically inaccurate, the Elizabeth films are beautifully done, and highly recommended.",1203465600,,2239,4.7890625
3044339,3,B000ZOXDG4,"The first hours of ETGA was thrilling. Elizabeth (the ever-awesome Cate Blanchett) reigns with confidence and charm. She is held in fearful esteem by her people, whom she swears to protect. But treachery is afoot, in the lingering presence of Catholics in England after the Reformation, and Elizabeth worries about the intentions of her captive cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. Meanwhile, Elizabeth plays a teasing game with suitors from around Europe, each hoping to make her his queen. Enter the dashing and roguish Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) fresh from his discovery of Virginia, named for his beloved virgin queen. Raleigh charms his way into Elizabeth's court, and encounters a monarch who is vulnerable in spite of her adamantine exterior. All of this plays out against the threat from Spanish King Philip, busy building a fleet of ships to recapture England for the Church and to depose the ""illegitimate"" Elizabeth.

As I said, the first half of the film was wonderful -- well-written, clever, visually stunning. The costumes were gorgeous, intricate and convincing. The acting was subtle and believable. It was touching to see Elizabeth grappling with husbandless middle age. But close to the halfway mark, the film founders and never recovers. Inexplicably, Raleigh (who heretofore had the hots for the queen herself) falls for one of her courtesans. This injects a silly ""forbidden love"" element into the film. After this, the movie ricochets from one movie clich to another. Elizabeth, uncovering a plot by her cousin to take the throne, is disconsolate at the thought of executing a God-appointed queen. This in spite of her father's unstated lack of scruples in beheading E's mother, Anne Boleyn. Philip sets Jesuit plots into spin and launches the Spanish Armada against England. With odds overwhelmingly favoring Spain, will Elizabeth let her darling Raleigh out of prison to take on the Spanish? Will she regain the composure needed to lead her besieged people to victory? Will the manly Raleigh manage to get off his burning ship on time? By the time the movie ended, I really did not care. I no longer believed the character's motivations and lost hope that the movie's loose threads (OK, was E OK with Catholics or bent on hunting them down?) would be tidied up. Having abandoned any hope that the filmmakers would be able to dramatize the panoply of events, the film settles for set pieces. Elizabeth is seen in her flowing nightie, gazing out to sea at the burning enemy ships -- which are clearly visible one moment and enshrouded by fierce storms the next. Symbolic scenes (e.g., the one in which E, perfectly-coiffed and costumed, is circled dizzyingly by the camera) alternate confusingly with literal scenes full of extras. Reconciled with her status as mother of her country, she blesses the child of a couple who should have suffered her regal wrath for having ignored the need for her permission to marry.

""Elizabeth, The Golden Age"" had so much going for it. But by trying to tell so many tales at once, it managed to tell none of them well. A disappointment to all but the most ardent Blanchett and Owen fans.",1203379200,,3152,4.96780303030303

3044342,3,B000ZOXDG4,"The '00 release `Elizabeth - the Golden Age' is a visually stunning but overall ponderous exercise clearly showing how difficult the making of a worthy sequel can be. While the production values, costumes, soundtrack and cast are superb it's definitely lacking the magical ""something"" that raises a good film to a great one.

There are some haunting cinematic moments not soon to be forgotten such as the sight of Elizabeth standing on a distant cliff along the dark and stormy coastline viewing the Spanish Armanda ablaze on the horizon, or the image of Elizabeth garbed in white armor with matching horse extolling the troops to greatness as her long flowing red hair and demeanor bears a striking resemblance to Saint Joan of Arc.

Unfortunately the role of the legendary monarch is not fleshed out to the extent as it was in the script of the first film, leaving Cate Blanchett little new territory to explore within the psyche of the Virgin Queen. She is left with little to do other than vacillate between a compulsive control freak and a lonely, scorned lover along with occasionally striking a Madonna-like pose while the majestic soundtrack blares in the background clearly attempting to instill within the mind of the viewer a sense of awe and holiness.

On the positive side, the most interesting addition to the storyline is Clive Owen in the role of explorer Walter Raleigh. It's only in Blancehtt's scenes with Clive that her character is allowed to show any emotional or intellectual depth. On a more personal basis, being by nature inclined to the arcane, I particularly appreciated the inclusion of the royal seer Dr. John Dee in the storyline.

3044343,2,B000ZOXDG4,"In the original Elizabeth we saw the title character transform from an inexperienced twenty-something into a queen by hardening her heart and learning the ways of cutthroat politics.  So, why in the sequel is she portrayed as a hysterical teenager?  The filmmakers didn't see fit to transfer any of what made the original character so great into the sequel.  Instead of the assured queen at the end of Elizabeth, in Elizabeth: The Golden Age we are treated to an insecure monarch reacting to a midlife crisis by acting half her age.

King Philip of Spain is amassing an armada to invade England.  He sees the Protestant queen as a spot of darkness in a Catholic world, even though, despite urgings to do so by her own counsel, she refuses to persecute Catholics in her own kingdom.  If this wasn't enough, her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, is planning to assassinate Queen Elizabeth and take the English throne.  In the midst of these political machinations is a love triangle between the explorer Walter Raleigh, Elizabeth, and one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting.

For all of the intrigue and subplots, not much happens for the first half of the film and instead of political intrigue the audience is forced to endure another love scene where the two romantics ride horses in the countryside.  Raleigh and Elizabeth's relationship is utterly unconvincing.  I cannot understand how anyone but the most nave would be taken in on Raleigh's ""philosophical musings"" about how when death closes in during a storm it only makes you want to live more, to which Elizabeth replies with wide eyes, ""Yes, to live!""  It sounds like the kind of life philosophy that would fit nicely in between sketches of unicorns and rainbows.

The looming threat of the Inquisition accompanies the Spanish armada, even though we are never shown the religious intolerance of the Inquisition.  The menace would have loomed larger if the audience was aware of just exactly what was at stake.  The first film had the tremendous opening where Protestant heretics were burnt at the stake, would it have been too much for a similar reminder that Europe still had one foot in the Dark Ages?  Perhaps director Shekhar Kapur felt the dialogue was already enough torture for his audience.

In the film's defense, it does fulfill the historical film's need for extravagance in costume and cinematography.  However, looking pretty just isn't enough.  After the extraordinary introduction to Elizabeth in the first film the last thing an audience wants to watch is a digression.  If the film is about her rise to world dominance, then why does it feel as if Blanchett's playing the role of a washed up actress, past her prime and unable to get her agent on the phone?  It seems as if Elizabeth is more concerned with aging than she is with running her country.  The central metaphor to the film is that of a storm, which is uttered from the lips of many characters, and to be sure when you finish watching Elizabeth: The Golden Age, you'll feel as if you've weathered one yourself.",1203206400,,3041,4.820809248554913

The film deals with some of the most famous events of Elizabeth's reign - the Babington Plot which led directly to the trial and execution of Mary Queen of Scots, the invasion of the Spanish armada, encounters with Walter Raleigh.  Don't come to this expecting an education; the film has only a nodding acquaintance with historical facts.

As you would expect, the visual quality of the DVD is outstanding.  The disc's special features include deleted scenes; short subjects on the making of the film; the reign of Elizabeth; creating the armada; towers, courts, and cathedrals; and a director's commentary.

Yes, the costumes were spectacular, the photography superlative, and the scenery breathtaking; in other words, this film is filled with eye candy. Cate Blanchett played the awesomely beautiful queen and I was transfixed by her performance - something that normally doesn't happen to me when I go to a movie.

Granted, there may be many historical inaccuracies in this film but I didn't buy a ticket to receive an education - I use other sources (such a books) to accomplish that. (What a concept!)

3044348,4,B000ZOXDG4,"While this sequel to the 1998 film Elizabeth pales in comparision, it still finds some nice moments in a film that seems more content on the film more as a work of moving art, with its lavish costumes, gorgeous sets, and stunning cinematography, and yet human development somehow gets lost beyond all the pretty pictures and lovely costumes.

Elizabeth's reign as queen is once again in peril. King Philip of Spain plans on Holy War against England and the protestant queen that rules it and plots of assaisination begin to form under the control of Mary Queen of Scots. All the while, Elizabeth finds her heart once again caught in the battle, as she takes notice of a dashing pirate, Sir Walter Reiligh.

What's the film suffers is its seemingly vacant story line and the near absent soapy drama that made the first film so entertaining to watch. the director has all this great history to go upon and yet he seems more intent on the look of the film then the actual feel of it. As for Geoffry Rush, his character is reduced to nothing more but a side note that does not carry the same effect as he did in the first film.

But the good thing is that on aspect of the first film did not change and that would be Cate Blanchett's performence. Still just as fierce as in the first film, she brings back all of the aspects of our Queen that we knew and love. With a bitting wit, steely determination, and the ability to show weakness at just the right moment, Blanchett is able infuse just enough life into a film that, without, would probally be entierly dead.",1202515200,,1559,4.463157894736842
3044349,4,B000ZOXDG4,"ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-German/dp/B000OY8NBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good German</a>).

With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.

The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, ""Bess"" (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shoot-Em-Up/dp/B000XA5K48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shoot 'Em Up</a>).

Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).

The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.

Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.

This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, ""Yeah. Seen it. Been there.""",1202515200,,3057,5.649237472766885
3044350,4,B000ZOXDG4,"2007's ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" picks up the story of Queen Elizabeth in 1585.  The young and uncertain woman who became Queen in ""Elizabeth"" is now the mature and confident icon of her people.  Cate Blanchett reprises her role as Elizabeth.

Director Shekhar Kapur sets three plot threads in motion at the beginning of ""The Golden Age.""  The first is Elizabeth's life at court, as she manages her counselors, a simmering rivalry between Protestants and Catholics, and proposals of marriage from a variety of foreign suitors. The lonely Elizabeth dotes on young ""Bess"" Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), a young, attractive and trusted lady in waiting.  Enter Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), handsome swashbuckling seadog and explorer, who widens Elizabeth's horizons with tales of a new world and bewitches her heart with his charm.

The second thread is the plotting of disgruntled Catholics against the Protestant Elizabeth.  Elizabeth's aging spymaster Walsingham (nicely reprised by Geoffrey Rush) seeks to guard her against assassination.  Her Catholic cousin and rival Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), is imprisoned in England but schemes with English and Spanish agents against Elizabeth.

The third thread is the threat posed by Philip II, King of Spain.  As defender of the Catholic faith, Philip intends to depose Elizabeth and is gathering a mighty naval armada and army for that purpose.

These three plot threads are linked, sometimes in surprising ways, and they will come together to threaten Elizabeth's hold on the throne.  The savage interrogation of an arrested Catholic plotter uncovers the Spanish threat to England, while driving Bess Throckmorton into the arms of Walter Raleigh.  A failed plot against Elizabeth's life ensnares Mary Stuart, leaving Elizabeth with an agonizing choice of punishment.  Philip's armada enters the English Channel and Elizabeth must rally England's tiny navy and army to face an invasion.

Ultimately, this becomes too many moving parts to manage gracefully.  Director Kapur handles the triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh, and Bess Throckmorton with delicate precision to a reasonably satisfying conclusion.  However, he chooses to interpret Mary Stuart's involvement in an assassination plot to suggest that the whole was a scheme of Philip to justify going to war (a more common interpretation is that the canny Walsingham gave Mary Stuart enough rope to hang herself).  The battle with the Spanish Armada is a series of melodramatic visuals laden with religious overtones that must have been close to incomprensible to American audiences unfamiliar with English history.  Philip, in real life an outstanding chief executive of a far-flung empire, is reduced to caricature as a gnome-like fanatic muttering threats in candle-lit royal chapels.

""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is a visually stunning treat, taking full advantage of lavish sets and costumes to present a sense of place and time.  The underlying theme of the original ""Elizabeth"" movie is reinforced with a vengeance, as Elizabeth must sacrifice her personal desires to rule and safeguard England as an iconic mother figure.  A strong cast helps carry the day.  This movie is recommended as solid entertainment to fans of costume drama and period pieces.",1202515200,,3281,5.415354330708661

3044352,3,B000ZOXDG4,"ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE isn't golden.  Expectations were high after Cate Blanchett's first foray in 1998 as Elizabeth I, but somehow this follow-up film, with the same director (Shekhar Kapur) and writer (Michael Hirst with assistance from William Nicholson), does not reach those heights.  Visually stunning, with an endless array of knockout costumes for Blanchett, special effects and scenery as majestic as any that have been photographed by fine cinematographer Remie Adefarasin and a musical score by Craig Armstrong and AR Rahman - all of these fine attributes cannot cover the weak script and the general lack of character development that hampers the usually exceptional core of actors.

The portion of Elizabeth's history covered by the film is the battle with Spain, England being the only country not participating in the Holy War in Europe under the direction of King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Moll&agrave;), complete with the surprise decimation of the approaching Spanish Armada due to the heroism and commitment of Elizabeth with her people.  The surrounding events include Elizabeth's dalliance with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the traumatic (for Elizabeth) beheading of Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), under the advisement of Elizabeth's trusted Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).

Blanchett is a consummate actress and manages to inhabit the persona of Elizabeth as much with her glances and body language and silences as with  the meager material from the script.  She IS a Queen reborn.  The remainder of the cast is adequate though shallow, and while each has very little to say they maintain an atmosphere of Elizabethan England.  This is a DVD that could well be watched without the soundtrack and still be entertaining for the visual splendors. It could have been so much more.

Sir Walter Raleigh is somewhat interesting, as is the queen's favorite lady, Bess--but the story isn't supposed to be about them, is it?
It's also incredibly irritating to watch scene after scene of actors being filmed through frosted glass. Apparently the director and cinematographer couldn't think of anything else to do.

3044354,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Almost a decade later, director Shekhar Kapur follows up his critically acclaimed Elizabeth with Elizabeth: The Golden Age which includes the ethereal Cate Blanchett reprising her role as the famous regent.

Now firmly settled into her throne, this second film follows Elizabeth facing the crisis of the invasion of the famous Spanish Armada. In addition to this she also has to deal with an internal crisis as she starts having great affection for Sir Walter Raleigh (played by Clive Owen)--a pirate staying at the court. She obviously is unable to marry him being that she is the Queen, and a queen who has already refused many offers of princes from all of Europe.

This is a glorious, sumptuous epic with award-caliber production. The cinematography is some of the best I have seen since Titanic, and the sets and costumes are magnificent. The sweeping score blends all the scenes together perfectly. Cate Blanchett's performance stands out from the star-studded cast as she reprises her role with a ferocious intensity.

I have only one complaint with the film. It is the fact that the director changed Elizabeth's character into a woman publicly longing and pursuing a man in ways that reminded me of a giddy love-struck teenage girl with their first crush. It seemed out of character for a regally mature, sophisticated queen who should already have experienced such things and outwardly have moved on.

This film is quite different in tone as the other one. It is much tamer (garnering a PG-13 rating compared to the R rating of the other one) and more entertaining with the love story and the climatic battle at the end. Even with the change and the rather major complaint the film manages to be a stunningly produced, acted, and compellingly wrought epic piece of cinema. It makes me hope Kapur will make the third of his planned Elizabethan trilogy.",1202256000,,1860,4.914012738853503
3044355,5,B000ZOXDG4,"This is truly an original cinematic experience. I have never seen such a personal and compelling film biography. It continues the legacy began by ""Elizabeth I."" Every moment was filled with such noble and human living. It simply astounds me that so many reviewers didn't realize that this was a Jungian study in the clash of a major archtype with the world in which she lived and ruled. This Elizabeth was superbly realized with none of the ticks of Bette Davis or the overt sexuality of Helen Mirren. Blanchett gave us a chance to see into the real Virgin Queen. This woman was not sexually frustrated, but in full control of her passions tempered with grace and personal integrity. She claimed her life and owned it with every fiber of her being. The supporting cast was perfect down to Tom Hollander as Mary Stuart's jailor. Samantha Morton gave an exquisite portrayal of a queen caught in the force of history. Clive Owen, as usual, was every inch the hero archtype.

If you have any sense of what it is to an individual in a heartless society, you will never get a moment to breathe, so mesmerizing is Kapur's direction and the simply balletic cinematography. Every costume is a statement of the character's feelings at every moment and the progression of color leads you to the ending that you know you're going to reach, but still can't is going to come to fruition.

In the decades to come, ""Elizabeth-The Golden Age"" will become the movie that the critics just didn't know how to approach. In this year of absolutely mediocre films (excepting ""Michael Clayton"")I cannot believe that this film was not on everybody's Top Ten List.

But then we as a film-going public do not appreciate the operatic, the sensuous, the heroic. We gravitate toward the bleak, violent worlds of the Coen Brothers and Clint Eastwood that foster hopelessness and alienation.

3044356,2,B000ZOXDG4,"Alas and anon...just when you thought it was safe to assemble an armada and go back into the water, someone goes and produces another costumer concerning a certain virgin queen. Bollywood director Shekhar Kapur has re-enlisted co-conspirators Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush for one more go at the old girl in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"".

Picking up a few decades hence from where he left off in his outstanding 1998 film ""Elizabeth"", which depicted the ascendancy of the title character, Kapur cheekily condenses a turbulent and historically significant 4-year period (1585-1588) during the reign of Elizabeth I into what appears to be a rather eventful week in the life of HRM.

As the film opens, we are introduced to a much more wary and care-worn monarch (an alarmingly thin Blanchett) holding court over England's destiny. Gone is the radiant, rosy-cheeked and free-spirited ""Bess"" who lit up the screen in the previous film; she has been replaced by a mercurial, slightly paranoid monarch who is constantly on guard against duplicitous well-wishers and sycophants. Even her closest confidants are kept at arm's length, especially her Machiavellian ""spymaster"", Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).

The Queen has two big headaches keeping her on edge. The first is her cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland (Samantha Morton, in a fiercely intense performance) who feels she is the rightful heir to the English throne, not the childless [...]  Elizabeth (who is a Protestant to boot). Mary has some influential Catholic sympathizers at home and abroad, including the other royal pain in Elizabeth's derriere, King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla), who gets his jollies jeering at the English queen and rattling his saber.

Elizabeth finds a temporary distraction from all her political woes when the dashing adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, in all his rangy glory) strolls into her court, full of tales and loaded with booty from his latest excursion to the New World. Elizabeth is obviously charmed, but has to suppress her schoolgirl crush for sake of appearances. However, when she learns that Raleigh has fathered a child and secretly eloped with her favorite chambermaid, Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish) she is not so amused, and gives him a nice cozy jail cell to explore for a few years. Not to worry, however-history intervenes and the Queen pardons Raleigh in time to put him in charge of naval defenses in the year of the Armada (1588), which fuels the film's climatic battle scenes.

I have to warn you, this is one of those ""historical"" epics where you have to make a decision going in whether you are going to nitpick and get cranky and argumentative over factual inaccuracies and behavioral anachronisms, or just sit back for two hours and enjoy the opulent pageantry and bodice-ripping court intrigue with a $#!+-eating  grin on your face. Keep in mind that the screenplay was authored by William Nicholson, who scripted the (very) loose re-interpretation of the Camelot legend, ""First Knight"" and Michael Hirst, who wrote several episodes of Showtime's recent mini-series about Henry VIII, ""The Tudors"". In other words, this ain't ""Masterpiece Theater"", folks.

Kapur does seem indecisive at times; it's as if he wasn't sure whether he wanted to make an updated version of ""Fire Over England"" (which depicted Elizabeth and Raleigh embroiled in court intrigue in the year of the Armada) or pay homage to ""The Sea Hawk"" (the swashbuckling action scenes featuring Owens in full Errol Flynn mode will definitely make history majors twitch). Nicholson and Hirst's dialogue fuels some spirited exchanges between Blanchett and Owen in the first half of the film that reminded me of the clever repartee from ""Shakespeare in Love "", but it ultimately clashes with some of the heavier moments later on (Samantha Morton nearly steals the movie in her execution scene, but it seems to belong in a completely different and darker-toned film).

If you are a fan of the genre, you will likely be pleased. Blanchett is
excellent in the lead role, and Owen is charismatic as always. Rush is good, although his character is a bit one-dimensional (not his fault).

An unholy mixture of the banal and the bombastic, this 2007 film once again stars Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth I, who spends much of her time flouncing around in outr outfits that seem more Kabuki than England circa 1585. (No doubt they are historically accurate. Who would have the nerve to invent them?)

Blanchett, miraculously gives a good performance, even when saddled with lines like this one, to Clive Owen's Sir Walter Raleigh: ""In another world, could you have loved me?"" Maybe, but in the world of this film, with a score that's positively deafening, it's amazing that she could even hear herself.

This handsomely mounted film, in its cute ADD way, quickly forgets its half-hearted early attempts to make History Relevant to What Is Going On in the World Today and soon morphs into a sort of Classic Comics on acid, or the longest Eurythmics video ever made. This time around, the Virgin Queen is up to her ruffled collars in romantic and political intrigues, mostly revolving around the dashing Raleigh and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), respectively. History tells us that when the film opens in 1585, Elizabeth, who has been on the throne for 27 years, is 52 years old, and that Raleigh is 19 years her junior. Blanchett, if anything, looks younger than her 38 years - and Owen, in real life, is five years older than Blanchett. But they're both so good-looking that you can accept the queen making goo-goo eyes over the poetry-spouting Sir Walter, who returns from the New World just after she's endured a bad-date montage of potential suitors.

Or is Liz actually smitten with her lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton (played by Abbie Cornish), who infuriates the queen by getting pregnant by Walt? This triangle appears to be inspired less by any historical evidence than by THE VIRGIN QUEEN, a 1955 Hollywood travesty wherein Liz, Walt and Bess were played by the more-age appropriate Bette Davis, Richard Todd and Joan Collins.

Meanwhile, Spanish Queen, er, King Philip II (a mincing Jordi Molla) is plotting to restore England to Catholicism by encouraging the Sceptr'd Isle's Catholics to revolt and install Mary on the throne. Phil's agents trick Elizabeth's spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), into thinking Mary is part of the conspiracy - providing Morton with a nifty execution scene and the Spanish an excuse to launch the Armada. Sir Walt gets sprung and named director of Homeland Security. Damn history and full speed ahead! Somehow he ends up leading the British fleet in some obviously CGI'd sea battles, even swinging from the masthead and diving off a burning ship.

At the same time, our girl Liz - who has modeled a succession of costumes that make those in the far less entertaining MARIE ANTOINETTE look positively dowdy - is gotten up in armor and delivers what appears to be an advance draft of the St. Crispin's Day speech from Henry IV. (If there are any history majors left in the audience by the time this scene comes up, the sound you will hear will be all of them screaming ""uncle."")

Presumably she, Shakespeare and Lord Essex will be heading off to explore America in Kapur's threatened third installment. Can't wait.",1201996800,,3400,4.894097222222222
3044358,4,B000ZOXDG4,"After reading some of the reviews I was a little shocked that there was so much to do over the lack of historical accuracy.  This is hollywood not the PBS. I thought the peformances were wonderful, the costumes and sets were magnificent and the story solid. Story, not history. Just goes to show that you will never please everyone and it is good to have varied points of view. SEE IT :)",1201910400,,387,4.375
3044359,5,B000ZOXDG4,"I had some reservations about this film before venturing to see it at the cinema. The rating, PG-13, was lower than the R the first movie had which brought a degree of trepidation about the content being watered down. As well as that I wondered if it would indeed be possible to achieve the degree of excellence which the first film had met.

Having watched this film again several times on DVD I believe that although the current film has not achieved the same degree of oppulent excellence as the first it has come pretty close. It is clear that the lower rating is intended to attract a wider audience and the naughtiness which abounded in the first film is still there in the second although not so obvious.

Both films display a degree of enlightenment of how to perceive the past. Others have characterised the Elizabeth films as mere historical dramas and romances and to a degree those perceptions are correct insofar as the settings go. However, this is, to me at least, a superficial interpretation but other perspectives have greater strength.

Growing up in England, I was exposed to wonderful television programmes and films which depicted a historical portrayal of merrie olde Englande which was very historically inaccurate. I used to believe that the grimy industrial England portrayed by Dickens amongst others was an inferior time of high infant mortality, short live spans and very Hobbesian in nature. Until, that is, I discovered that Dickens was paid by the word and to keep his readers interested he portrayed the country in such a way that they would crave for more. Simialrly, closer examination of merrie olde Englande showed that it was not very merry at all.

In conjunction with that, history of human sexuality was largely began from Victorian times with their sense of prudishness and repression and it has been falsely claimed that much of current life was non-existant before so-called modern times.

Viewed from these perspectives both fims shed a different light on events of Elizabethan times. Elizabeth is not a single strong woman, she is a survivor against men who resent her grip on power. She was, like Margaret Thatcher, the strongest ""man"" of her time. Similarly the record of the times showed that although there were certain societal rules which needed to be followed, they were often broken but unless they were discovered and exposed they continued. Feints within feints as Frank Herbert would write in Dune.

What I love about these films, aside from their radical perspective on past events and the personalities of the time, is their focus on intrigue and plots. The machinations of the Catholic Church as exemplified by Philip of Spain in the battle to prevent the supremacy of the Anglican church from occuring, the jockeying for power utilising religion as a front, the godfather ruthlessness of the time and indeed the correlation with the penultimate scenes of that movie, all within times which were supposedly much simpler than our own.

Ultimately though Elizabeth is human, a woman, a woman of strength who subborns her own needs and desires to those of her country. Elizabeth the consumate politician. Is this a story of Elizabeth I or the current monarch residing on the throne of the United KIngdom? Sometimes one wonders, not least in the role of the closest of her advisers.

There is much for thought and entertainment in this film. Blanchett's performance is stunning once more and Clive Owen has come a long way since his Chancer days. All in all this is an excellent film and will be judged as such in the longer term.",1201910400,,3586,4.886513157894737
3044360,4,B000ZOXDG4,"I took the trouble to go to the theatre to see it. Kate Blanchett makes a fine Elizabeth. I tried watching the Helen Mirren performance and could only say to myself ""it looks like one of those awful PBS Shakespeare performances""
  The scenes with the Spanish Armada were particularly awful. Elizabeth's astral spirit runs out onto what I assume are the cliffs of Dover so she can watch the battle on the waves. The music soars and we get the impression the she is some kind of saint saving Christendom from the evil Catholic Phillip. Well I guess the British are entitled to their fantasies.
  She had cut off all her hair to wear wigs but in the climactic speech to I think about 150 troops she has on what has to be the most amazing Elizabethan wig. The poor women begs for a hug from Raleigh because she's such a frustrated old maid, I guess.
  A scene is inserted where an asassin forgets to shoot her. He has a gun, a clear shot, and decides that she is such a goddess I guess that he can't kill her. You wouldn't see Hammas being that weak. This never happened. I still recommend watching this one.  I have a suggestion for movie makers. How about Isabella the Catholic next?

As to this melting pot unrequited love, wonderful scenes from history, who can forget Raleight and the cloak over the puddles scene, as well as murder, treason and intrigue, don't forget Mary Queen of Scots here, and of course Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's right hand man and Britain's first true spymaster and you have a film that totally takes your breath away.

Forget the fact that historically there are probably more holes in it than a Swiss Cheese, the movie follows the spirit of the era in my opinion and is worth seeing just for the quality acting from Cate Blanchett as the passionate Elizabeth, Geoffry Rush as the deadly Walsingham, and the lovely Samantha Morton as the doomed Mary Queen of Scots, along with sumptious constumes, a great soundtrack, some nifty special effects.

I liked this film, it is as good if not better than the film Elizabeth and its a real shame it has not been nominated for more Oscars, certainly it deserved it considering what did get nominated this year!",1201305600,,1562,5.265060240963855

Well, you shouldn't be able to tell her age and generally too much knowledge of history will spoil the fun. When the movie started I decided to follow Coleridge's advice to ""suspend my disbelief"" and enjoyed it OK.
You don't get a lesson in history here (a very general but shouldn't you have known before about the Armada?) you get a picturesque vision of history and as such it works. Some twists made me smile. I found it quite amusing that all Roman Catholics look ugly and their behaviour is rather irrational. A comment to the ending - Elisabeth left England in debts (although not bankrupt as Philip did) and the quoted ""age of prosperity"" led directly to the Civil War half a century later.

3044364,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I won't write 1,000+ words ranting or raving on about this film, but I will put in a few remarks without simply listing out a detailed summary of the film. A little background, I saw the original Elizabeth in 1998 when I was in high school and loved it; it's still one of my favorite movies of all time. I am a history buff in the strictest sense, I have a bachelors and masters in history and am now working on a PhD in British history in the UK, but I still love good movies. The first Elizabeth film admittedly had its flaws, but in the end it generally got across an accurate enough story. When I heard a sequel was being made, I was so excited. And then I saw this crap...
Kapur said that he wanted this movie to be different from the first, as if he was making a totally different film, and boy did he succeed, but probably not in the way he intended. First of all, the characters were cardboard stereotypes and poorly written, directed and even acted. Don't get me wrong, I love Cate Blanchett, she's one of my favorites of all time, but in her defense, you can only do so much with what you are given. This Elizabeth is a one-dimensional, zombie of a spinster who the movie makers try so obviously and painfully to spell out for the audience that she isn't a woman that they want people to identify with, in fact they try in every way they can to set her apart as being as obviously abnormal as they can. For the whole movie she speaks in the same, old, monotone, voice, just like some kind of robot. It's painful to see such a great actress having to stunt all of her talent to force out such a stilted and shoddily developed character. The sloppy, sloppy attempt to show Elizabeth as having a possibly sexual relationship with Bess was just ridiculous and so poorly done that it ended up being insulting to the intelligence of the audience and even more so to the GLBT community by being so terribly written and performed.
Equally as insulting was the depiction of Philip II. Was it really necessary to depict the Spanish Armada as losing their battle because they didn't notice approaching English fire ships because they were so feverishly involved in what was depicted as cultish prayer? Give the Spanish a little more credit than that, and give the English a little more credit at being able to defeat their enemies for reasons beyond their inability to observe approaching enemies...
And one last thing, the one thing that I as an historian was picky about and was looking for going into the theater: showing Mary Queen of Scots as having a thick Scottish brogue? Seriously? Anyone who knows anything more about Mary than the pulp fiction legends and myths of the woman know that she grew up in France. It was an immediate signal to me that this film was going on sham research and would be pandering to an audience who they felt wouldn't notice or perhaps even care that they weren't just taking artistic liberties with histories but were turning it into a poorly written soap opera that wouldn't even be up to the level of quality one would expect on daytime TV.
I only wish I could erase the memories of this movie from my mind and only remember the first Elizabeth film. If you want to see a well-done portrayal of the later years of the life of Elizabeth I which is up to the level of that first film, I would suggest that you instead watch 'Elizabeth I' with Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons.",1199750400,,3410,4.431528662420382
3044365,1,B000ZOXDG4,"This was one movie I really hope that it will be impressive but as it turned out, it proves to be a really lousy movie. Cate Blanchett proves to be superb but she can't save a sinking ship like this movie.

I am not going to get into details about the historical accuracy since like the first Elizabeth, this is more like a historical fantasy closer to the Lord of the Rings then history of Britain. But I would say this, the director really sucks and whoever wrote the script needs to be taken out and flog, and finally, who did the editing in this movie should not have any children of their own. Simply put, these three elements of the movie failed the paying customers badly.

This movie appears to be a visual feast without a coherent story. We have poor Cate doing a lot of standing still, a lot close-up in her great costumes and a lot of staring. And yes, it quite visually fantastic and it would even be more if there was a developing script to all this. The movie appears to be over-edited as the plot move from scene to scene, each scene almost independent from other scenes. What you get as a result is a movie that don't make a lot of sense and where characters do things that don't flow with other scenes.

Since the movie is a historical fantasy in the first place, I wondered why the people who made this movie make a pretense of history? If they are going to throw away the history books, do so and create a script and a movie that flow and tell a story - like the first Elizabeth did. That film is a total fantasy and that is why it worked just fine. This is why this movie was such a killer of time, for people who were making fantasy movie, they tried to turn it into some sort of historical epic!!

This plain jane DVD (Amazon's description) won't cut the mustard. This movie really needs to be reedited and re-shot in-order to be save. I doubt if that will occur.",1198627200,,1885,4.256983240223463
3044366,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Sometimes I wonder just how much thought critics put into how hard it is to create the films they so gleefully shred in their reviews. Hundreds of actors, artists, technicians, and workers slave away for years to produce something in the mind's eye of one crazed director who channels it through one or two exhausted actors, and what comes out of the effort is more than a film, it is years of their life they will never get back, spend willingly to give you ENTERTAINMENT, or perhaps even, (dare we say it?) ART.

Not that it isn't hard to tell the difference between the two sometimes. When a movie makes you want to stand-up and cheer is it entertainment? When a film makes you want to cry is it art? Then you have movies like this one, where maybe you feel a little like doing both. I guess that just makes it a good and worthy movie, perhaps even great.

Cate Blanchett, one of the great actors of our time, so much more than a movie star, as she crafts her roles with a genius that you completely believe her in the characters she plays. Of course I knew her name long before the first Elizabeth came out (thanks to my sister Codemaster Talon), and could appreciate her enormous talent. It did appear that she would always be great and never be famous because of the sort of roles she always chose to play (period pieces and such), but like the amazing Gerard Butler, or the controversial Russel Crowe, sometimes history, if Hollywoodized a bit, can make for a rather entertaining film that might even be thought by some to be art, and that sort of thing often makes the lead actor famous...and the movie an EPIC.

Again, an Epic is a hard movie to make, particularly if the studios aren't throwing money around like snowballs Christmas day. I never saw the first Elizabeth (call that irony), but I heard great things. So naturally when I saw the trailer for this movie during the particularly dry season of interesting-looking movies, I wanted to see what it was all about. Actually, the real reason I wanted to see it was that it had so many great actors working together on the same historical epic (and I love epics!). Clive Owen (I first loved him in the BMW commercials known as ""The Hire"", and I still think he was great in King Arthur) as a charming historical pirate (errr...PRIVATEER), Geoffry Rush as the wizened old advisor, (the always wonderful Samantha Morton as the imprisoned rival Mary) and or course Cate Blanchett as the impossibly strong, noble, proud, GREATEST ruler England has ever known. If that isn't enough to grab your attention anymore I don't know what is.

From the previews, one might think this movie solely about Enlgand's fight against the Spanish Armada, and indeed that is the climax of the movie. But there is much that comes before. This movie actually features three major plot points/story arcs. Firstly, there is the drama that is Mary Queen of Scotts, wherein said rival, of course believing that SHE is the rightful Queen of England, plots and schemes to bring down Elizabeth whilst still in captivity. It's great stuff. Like so MANY people in this movie, the hardship of the times, heavy superstition, the harshness of life, has led to a kind of fanatical insanity. Mary is convinced that Elizabeth is a devil, and herself a saint. God is on her side, should she fail she will be taken to heaven forthwith. There's something almost noble about someone with that particular brand of insanity, believing in themself and the rightness of their desires no matter WHAT. When she dies (as history dictates she must), it is one of the greatest death scenes I have ever seen. Brilliantly directed too.

The Queen the handmaiden and the Pirate

The second story arc is about sometime pirate/explorer Walter Raleigh, and his relationship with the Queen and her Lady-in-Waiting dear friend. I gotta say, it's really great to see Clive Owen playing a character who isn't a total downer. Granted, he can play serious characters brilliantly, but sometimes kinda feel sorry for him, like maybe he's really terminally depressed and just playing himself onscreen. At any rate, this character is a charmer, and I absolutely love the way Owen plays him. This love triangle is about something hard to describe, but easy to feel if you are familiar. Owen loves the Queen with all his heart, but he knows from the get-go that anything ROMANTIC would only cheapen and weaken her as a person. So he is VERY honored and privileged to love her from a distance, emotionally if not physically. He expresses openly his dedication and affection for her, but naturally, being only human, she wishes it was something more romantic and less idealistic, in her heart, since she knows deep down such a thing can never be. When a romance develops between the Queen's lady and her knight, she is understandably furious, because to her it symbolizes something that she knew she could never have, snatched away forever by one she thought her dearest friend. The poor Queen failed to realize (the way that I see it), that it was actually just another way for the man to become closer to her by making part of her his own. The best scenes from this segment of the movie are Raleigh's repeatedly asking to be sent away to start a colony, and repeatedly being forced to stay by the Queen who simply will not let him go. The best scene in my opinion is the one where she gives him a high position which attaches him to her permanently, and the look on his face when he receives it, a bit like she just ran him through with a sword. Deep down the Queen must know that for a man like it making him stay home is like shooting his horse or burning his ship before his eyes, but naturally a person with such great power can't imagine how making her happy could possibly not make everyone happy (the quick exchanges between Raleigh and Elizabeth during moments of friction are brilliant).

The Spanish Armada

Okay, so from the trailers what you REALLY wanted to see was a huge battle sequence at the end with the whole Spanish Armada and the English fleet clashing in an epic climax. Well, in that case... you may be let down. The whole thing felt more than a bit anti-climactic, and was oven way too quickly. Ended almost as quickly as it actually started, despite all the build-up. I was really hoping for more, maybe some actual historical detail in the days that it took for the battle for control of the world to be decided. But all in all, it's not enough to kill the movie by any means.

If you love history, love Cate Blanchett and find politics and England fascinating subjects you're sure to find this a fun movie. Definitely a rental at least. Maybe more if you're a hard-core fan of any of the above.",1198368000,,6714,4.60233918128655
3044367,3,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth - The Golden Age"", the second part of a planned trilogy, features Cate Blanchett reprising her Academy Award nominated role from almost ten years ago. She is very good, she is always good, and one of three actresses I would watch read the phone book. The other two are Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. And Clive Owen is suitably dashing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but ""The Golden Age"" is lacking. In many ways.

In 1998, ""Elizabeth"" caused a sensation because Blanchett turns in an electrifying performance. Also, the film is stunningly gorgeous. And it continues our fascination with British royalty by depicting a small part of perhaps the most interesting monarch's reign. It was also our first visit to this oft-filmed monarch's life in a while, so it was interesting, refreshing and new to watch this director's and this actor's interpretation of the role. Since then, HBO produced a multi-part miniseries featuring Helen Mirren playing the same role. With more than six years between the two projects, we had enough time to give Mirren fresh eyes for her interpretation of the same monarch. The HBO project covers much of the same ground as 1998's ""Elizabeth"" but also goes further, to show her facing down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart, the Spanish king and more. Now less than two years after this memorable turn, we have ""The Golden Age"" featuring Blanchett playing Elizabeth as she faces down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart and the Spanish King's threats to invade England. Due to the proximity of the two films, ""The Golden Age"" draws unfavorable comparisons.

""The Golden Age"" seems `light' somehow. Like the force behind the story of the first film and the force of the production as a whole has been diluted. The film has more than one shot of Blanchett in an elaborate costume standing in the middle of a room as the camera circles her. This is interesting the first time, but when it happens a couple of times, it dilutes the power of this vision. We get it. Elizabeth has the weight of the country on her shoulders. And as queen, she gets to wear some amazing outfits. But when the shot is repeated, it seems designed to show off the costumes and appear to be filler rather than to help the story.

Blanchett is, as always, good. She is one of those actors who I think are incapable of giving a bad performance. Sure, they have appeared in bad films, but they are always interesting. As Elizabeth, she plays a character that seems tailor made for her, to accentuate the regal bearing of the actress. But in ""The Golden Age"", many of Elizabeth's best moments, her most powerful, were just portrayed by Mirren. Unfortunately, there are almost identical scenes and this really does ""The Golden Age"" and Blanchett a disservice.

Blanchett is a forceful personality and it is fun to watch her flirt and hold court. She really shows us many aspects of the monarch's character and life. But we don't get a feeling for the character's Virgin Queen status. Yes, we see her suitors and there are a couple of mentions made of this fact, the Queen's unmarried and unable to sire an heir, but it doesn't seem to be the pressing need we have come to believe. Too bad, because this is a fairly important part of her life. And it was a big part of Mirren's performance. Instead, ""The Golden Age"" concentrates on the impending conflict with the King of Spain.

Enter Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh. Upon his arrival at Elizabeth's court, he introduces himself and announces he has just returned from the New Land and named a colony Virginia, after the Queen. His gifts include potatoes and he brings two Native American Indians with him. But the impending threat of Spain changes Raleigh's actions; initially, he seems attracted to the Queen, and she him, but then his affections turn towards a younger member of the Queen's court, the Queen's most trusted friend.

As Spain prepares their armada for war, Raleigh jumps into action and begins to help the smaller British fleet defend England. As the Spanish ships attack, Owen swings from ship to ship, channeling the spirit of Errol Flynn. He even appears a little like the former swashbuckler film hero. The actor brings a dashing quality to the character, making him a bit of a rogue, a bit of a hero, a bit of the bad boy. It is no wonder the Queen falls for him.

Geoffrey Rush returns as Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's advisor. As he is sick throughout most of the film, he mostly stands by her side, raising his arched eyebrow when he doesn't agree or approve of something the monarch has said or done.

Rhys Ifans has a brief role as Robert Reston, a Catholic plotting to kill Protestant Elizabeth on behalf of the Catholic king of Spain. And Samantha Morton plays Mary Stuart, the woman at the center of many of Elizabeth's headaches.

""The Golden Age"" is beautiful to look at; the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to recreate the royal palaces and London of Elizabeth's age. The ships in the Spanish and British fleets are also particularly impressive. During the battle between the two fleets, we get a real sense for what life was like on these ships. Life and death.

But the film fails to fully engage us in the story. If you go to see this film, you probably have at least a rudimentary grasp of the history of these events. So the film should not have to work hard to engage us in the lives of Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh and the Queen's court. It should work hard to give us insight into the woman's life, the woman's thoughts, and the woman's feelings. But instead, it seems to want to focus more on the action-packed parts of the story, to make it more of an action film. It is almost seems like the filmmakers would like to recast Elizabeth in the mold of Sarah Connor, the role created by Linda Hamilton in ""The Terminator"" films. This doesn't work and detracts from the already interesting elements of the story.

""Elizabeth - The Golden Age"" is a bit of a wash. It features a strong performance from Cate Blanchett, a dashing performance from Clive Owen and looks beautiful, but it doesn't engage enough or give us enough insight into the monarch herself.",1198195200,,6158,4.692592592592592
3044368,3,B000ZOXDG4,"As I am a die hard fan of Kapur's Elizabeth, I was overjoyed when I found out that they were releasing a sequel, with both Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush returning. I made sure that I saw it on the date it came out, but I left the theatre feeling disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is an entertaining and visually lush film. The costumes are beautiful, the music is nice, and Blanchett (though looking a little young for a queen who should have been in her 50s), Rush, Clive Owen (as Walter Raleigh), and Samantha Morton (as Mary Queen of Scots) all give wonderful performances. However, it still felt as if the movie had something missing.

I know that the first Elizabeth was riddled with historical inaccuracies, but the movie contained so much plot and intrigue it allowed one to overlook its inconsistencies. Elizabeth: The Golden Age, however, falls short in that it focuses almost exclusively on the pseudo-romance between Elizabeth and Walter Raleigh (while Elizabeth did indeed have feelings for many of her male court favorites, Raleigh included, it was far from the fairy tale we see here) at the expense of leaving out many important characters and events. For example, where is Elizabeth's former love and best friend Robert Dudley? He is not even mentioned in this film, and it is a well known fact that not only did he participate in the Armada in 1588, he died later that same year, causing Elizabeth to stay shut in her room for days. Also missing is his stepson Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex, who was well on his way to becoming Elizabeth's golden boy.

Inaccuracies aside, there was so much going on in the actual time of Elizabeth I's second half of her reign (The Golden Age) that it is quite sad that all we get to see in this film consists of Elizabeth and Raleigh flirting, dancing, and riding around on horseback together or Elizabeth whispering her fears and desires to the only lady-in-waiting who seems to have been of any degree of importance, Bess Throckmorton (later Bess Raleigh).

The sad thing is, that with such talented actors, all this needed was a more fleshed out script and this could have come close to equalling its predecessor.",1198195200,,2204,4.731770833333333
3044369,2,B000ZOXDG4,"-
First of all, The story or History - well, I don't think the King Of Spain, Filipe II, wich was also, at the time, the King Of Portugal (the Portuguese throne gave him the command of the high seas - so, much of the ships were Portuguese caravelas), was only concerned with the Queen of England - it's ridiculous. And surely isn't as diabolical as showed. He made war against England not only because of the protestant position of Elizabeth BUT the fact that England's piracy were robbing ships and Spanish colonies with the Queen's consentment and not respecting the treaty causing economic conflict.

The only good thing in this movie is - as everyone knows - Cate Blanchet. Samantha Morton was also good in her role as Mary, Queen of Scots. I agree with most of the people. The first film was much better - the dialogues, intrigue, menace, all great, memorable sometimes. And with a grand finale! This movie, Elizabeth - The Golden Age lacks a good screenplay, intensity - Some lines are unbelievable dull. It looks like a soap-opera sometimes. Very bad supporting actors like the young Bess! Even Rush isn't as good as he was on the first chapter. But with such discrepancies it could have been a good film, but it fails mainly because of the heavy handed Kapur.

3044371,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Occassionally a movie is made that makes you forget where you are for a couple of hours. This is one of them. It is impossible to watch this film and not be completely transported into her time.

Cate Blanchette was the perfect Elizabeth. She is regal and fierce in her role. She also shows the human side of Elizabeth and faces some of the same worries and circumstances that women in our age do such as wondering who she will marry and what is ethical. She had to make hard decisions that impacted all of England.

This movie gives you an historical perspective on the religious struggle in medieval Europe. Elizabeth leads her troops into war against King Phillip and beats him soundly, expertly avoiding an expanded Inquisition that was brutal and intolerant.

Of course there are many intense battle scenes as well as execution and torture. I had to cover my eyes. The cinematography was breath-taking and the costumes seem very authentic.

Elizabeth was made very human in this movie and is vivid unlike many written accounts of her life. This is a must-watch for anyone.",1197936000,,1077,4.74331550802139
3044372,4,B000ZOXDG4,"There were two tides of hype for this movie: it started off with the brilliance of Cate Blanchett reprising her old role that propel to international stardom, the next wave came when the movie was put down as badly executed production with brilliant subject (though some lack historic evidence) and an outstanding cast.

The Golden Age picked up where last time was left behind. Elizabeth is a loved queen who refused to punish the Catholics for their belief. However, Europe is still not ready for a Protestant bastard ruler in the area. So the Spanish plot of assassination and invasion rolled up. Elizabeth, apart from being threatened by the overseas forces is also going through her personal struggle - aging and not being able to love anymore (or show affection) as a virgin queen. The premise is great as it shows that we are treading into the premises of the fear of age while try to put yourself together publicly. However, this is also the premises that brought the less convincing Clive Owen and Abbie Cornish characters in. Elizabeth tried to feel what was like to be a woman again through them but only to find out that the same put her into more misery. The plot was a quite winding but very predictable. Also this time round Walsingham (Georffrey Rush) had family affairs to attend to - which was supposed to put some human touch in him - didn't work miracle either. So the subplots all became very loose as Elizabeth carried further burden of avoiding the movie to fall apart on top of her scripted threats.

Performance-wise, Cate Blanchett is brilliant as usual. However, she is now so good that unless she changed her identity to play Bob Dylan, it might not be able to secure her another Oscar. She could end up like Meryl Streep being nominated in whatever she does, but needs more luck to win as she is now being taken for granted as a great actress of our age. Never like Abbie Cornish. For her role, anyone can do it and I personally think that Scarlett Johansson will be able to put so much more depth into the character while radiating it with doses of sex appeal even when she is wrapped up like cake in her costume. For Clive Owen, he is good but not good enough to make his story line interesting. But he definitely has the power to shake Elizabeth to her core. Clive has that touch of openness that made his scenes with Cate so much more interesting. But all his other scenes with Abbie Cornish is just like ""ok we got it can we move on?""

Elizabeth: The Golden Age is not a bad movie, and especially after reading 6000 million bad reviews about it and then you watch it without expectation. But I think all the bad reviews didn't really do justice to the movie itself. Elizabeth was great and it was an unexpected runaway hit, so the stakes are high this time. If this is not a sequel, I think the critics will be much more lenient - well they are lenient enough to say Cate Blanchett is the only saving grace for the movie - instead of full scale bashing. So the best approach will be watch it as an individual movie and forget about the movie 9 years ago, then you will be able to enjoy it. But one thing that bugs me most are all those stills trying to tell you how much money they put into the costumes and sets. Come on, it's period piece they ARE suppose to look great, especially when you are talking about the court. And one last thing - yes you can compare the Cate 10 years ago with the present Cate as it has two split second flash back of the young Elizabeth from the 1998 movie.",1196467200,,3522,4.415384615384616
3044373,2,B000ZOXDG4,"First of all, The story or History - well, I don't think the King Of Spain, Filipe II, wich was also, at the time, the King Of Portugal (the Portuguese throne gave him the command of the high seas - so, much of the ships were Portuguese caravelas), was only concerned with the Queen of England - it's ridiculous. And surely isn't as diabolical as showed. He made war against England not only because of the protestant position of Elizabeth BUT the fact that England's piracy were robbing ships and Spanish colonies with the Queen's consentment and not respecting the treaty causing economic conflict. Plus, Filipe was one of the most intelligent men in the world and the most powerfull too.

3044374,1,B000ZOXDG4,"What can I say, the 1st Elizabeth was simply great, the kind of movie leaving you riveted to the edge of your seat!

Unfortunately this one is very much the complete opposite. So yes the costumes are great and the few CGI special effects (basically the couple of minutes of action featuring the ships of the spanish Great Armada) are well made.

But apart from that it's a 2 hours torture that could have easily been reduced to a half-hour. There's no rhythm, it's very very slow, with many supposedly 'key' scenes just  dragging on & on & on (e.g. the execution, the baby, the kiss, etc etc...). The trailer pretty much shows what's worth watching out of the 2 hours movie, how sad is that?

Kate Blanchett's acting is possibly the only positive note overall & Clive Owen is pathetic as usual (though his worst performance is still Children of Men). As for Geoffrey Rush I really like him but he doesn't have much to do in this movie.

In the end, you feel the director made an attempt to depict some kind of intimate portrayal of Elizabeth: her fears, her doubts, her loneliness... Fine, but then stick to making some BBC TV documentary. Because for a full-length cinema feature it's definitely not good enough! Kapur should have stuck to the winning formula that worked so well for the 1st movie: the intrigues, the twisted plots, the action...

The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!

To all those who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the Elizabeth: The Golden Age, prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church & their allies in the Spanish government had the armada succeeded in its mission.

If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of  the dictator Franco!!

Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line.

On the home front, Elizabeth is being pressured to marry by her advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).  She rejects many possible husbands, but finds some interest in Sir Walter Raleigh (Owen).

""The Golden Age"" is an entertaining but flawed movie.  On the positive side, it is great to look at.  The costumes, set design, and cinematography are gorgeous.  The acting, while not as standout as in the first movie, is still impressive, especially by Cate Blanchett.  On the negative side of things, the story isn't that exciting.  Historical fact is also compromised for cinematic value, but not much is added.  The war with Spain comes and goes quickly, and without much excitement.

While Elizabeth (Blanchett) is busy deflecting unsuitable suitors and falling for the dashing Walter Raleigh (Owen), imprisoned cousin Mary (Morton) plans her assassination with the backing of Spain's devout Catholic king, Phillip II (Jordi Molla), who has promised to rid England of Protestants. The first half of the film has a lot going for it: lavish, detailed and not as stiff as your usual period dramas, The Golden Age allows the love story to take precedence and the subtle wooing between the Queen and Raleigh boasts a few cracking put-downs. Blanchett, arguably the best actress of her generation, knows how to play Elizabeth and has fun with the character, while Owen et al just about match her. It's obvious that Kapur wanted to devote more time to the Spanish invasion, but time or money trimmed the battle back to such an extent that the grandiose Armada lacks any real significance - both visually and story-wise. A story of two halves, The Golden Age works better as a love story than a political conspiracy.",1193529600,,1202,5.015
3044378,5,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" entrances.  Presented at the Toronto Film Festival, Cate Blanchett is riveting.  The range of queen to a private woman with doubts & desires is exquisite.  Blanchett played in the 1998 film ""Elizabeth"" & was nominated for an Oscar.  She won Best Supporting Actress for ""The Aviator"" in 2004 and was nominated for ""Notes on a Scandal"" in 2006.  She centerpieces the film.

An array of excellent players includes Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh. Nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2004 for ""Closer,"" Owen flirtatiously woos Elizabeth.  Geoffrey Rush plays Sir Francis Walsingham who connives adeptly.  Rush won Best Actor for ""Shine"" in 1996, nominated again in 2000 for ""Quills.""

Australian beauty Abbie Cornish, memorable in ""Somersault"" and played in ""A Good Year"" with Russell Crowe, portrays Elizabeth's closest attendant, Bess Throckmorton.  With stunning good looks, she displays great range from the official to personal with Sir Walter to concern for her cousin.

Her cousin Francis Throckmorton is played by Steven Robertson.  In brief scenes, he is memorable, urging Bess to help him regain favor with the Queen and in torture as Rush's Walsingham wrenches information from him.  Robertson had a small role in Orlando Bloom's ""Kingdom of Heaven.""

Eddie Redmayne, who was Matt Damon's son in ""The Good Shepard,"" plays Thomas Babington who attempts to assassinate Elizabeth with an unloaded gun.  He's great face-to-face with Blanchett.

Samantha Morton has 5 films this year & plays Queen Mary Stewart of Scotland with regal bearing and the nervous repose of a political plotter.  I'll always recall her looking at Tom Cruise in ""Minority Report"" and shouting ""RUN!""

Shekhar Kapur directs as with the 1998 ""Elizabeth.""  He has since directed ""The Guru"" and ""The Four Feathers.""  Michael Hirst wrote the screenplay for the 1998 ""Elizabeth.""  He is joined by William Nicholson who has screenwriting Oscar nominations for ""Shadowlands"" (1993) & ""Gladiator"" (2000).

The wonderful cinematography from colorful pageantry to somber prisons is by Remi Adefarasin who shot the 1998 film plus Woody Allen's 2005 ""Match Point"" & Michael Apted's ""Amazing Grace.""

Also starring is costume designer Alexandra Byrne.  Her costumes are gorgeous & stunning.  Byrne's 3 Oscar nominations for costume design include Hamlet (96), Elizabeth (98) & ""Finding Neverland"" (04).  She costumed ""Sleuth"" with Michael Caine & Jude Law.

Elizabeth is a stunning film that sweeps us into the epic, keeps us entranced with a story that does not drag, is performed exquisitely & leaves an appreciation for this era.  Enjoy!",1193270400,,2632,5.322815533980583
3044379,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I wanted to love this movie.  It does fall a bit flat and stale when compared to the first Elizabeth and other costume movies.

The Plot - There is a plot but it is scattershot and a bit vague.

The Dialog - It is rather weak at many times during the movie. Much of the dialog is in the form of questions and sarcastic humor. That gets boring after the first 20 minutes of hearing it.

The costumes - They look amazing!

The cinimatography - Is a bit on the artsy side and is rather grainy at times.  It still managed to look appropriately stylish.

Obvious disappointments - The Queen was in armor but she looked so uncomfortable up on the horse.  I did not feel conviced that she was going to fight in the war and she didn't which I thought was going to happen. It would have been awesome to see the Queen sword fight even if it did NOT happen in reality.  It would have been entertaining.

The characters were very annoying especially the rogue man that Elizabeth had a crush on.  It was rather unbelievable that such a ""strong"" Queen would fall for such a low life loser.

Was Spain that threatening to Elizabeth and England? Well the director didn't convince me enough to dislike Spain.

The acting - It ranged from average to excellent.  Cate did her best with the stale script and probably insufficient directing.  The other female actress (blond younger lady) did a great job too.

I hope they make a third movie and do a much better job at forming a quality script.

Overall it seemed rushed and it was somewhat dull.
This movie was worth watching for the drama and neat costume design that it presented but I will not purchase this movie once it is released on DVD.

Comments on my review are welcomed. :)",1192838400,,1715,4.390476190476191
3044380,4,B000ZOXDG4,"The sets, the costumes, the sheer beauty of the landscape is enough to earn this film a 5 star rating.  Parts of this film were so gloriously done they inspired the awe I feel looking at an illuminated text with the gorgeous gold leaf border and kid smooth binding.

Cate Blancett was stellar as an aging Queen Elizabeth, coping with the decline of her fertility while she still had to play the game of trying to find a suitable man to sit beside her on the throne.  Her wit dealing with Sir Walter Raleigh had everyone in the theatre laughing at one particular line regarding Raleigh's proposed name for his colony.  Her quandary over dealing with Mary, Queen of Scots was touching--what should she have done with a kinswoman and Queen.  Her leadership during war was inspiring.

I do not have sufficient scholarship in English history to comment on the verity of the romantic storyline with Sir Walter Raleigh. The general accounts are true, whether they were over-stated for film purposes or not should be determined by someone with more knowledge than I.

I will say the film was very worth attending and I'm glad to have seen it full screen in a theatre.  While modern home technology does do a fine job of rendering films--there's nothing to compare with a large-scale screen for the more gorgeously filmed movies.

I'm predicting at least a nomination for Blancett as Elizabeth as well as for the costumers, set designers and cinematographers.  This may well be a movie to buy when it comes out--particularly if you have the capability to really showcase this gorgeous film.",1192579200,,1581,4.779411764705882
3044381,3,B000ZOXDG4,"***1/2

""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" picks up pretty much where 1998's ""Elizabeth"" left off.  The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England.  On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without.  The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth`s own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.

Whereas the first ""Elizabeth"" was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading).  Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time.  The scenes depicting this more or less ""platonic"" love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly.  Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping ""pirate,"" Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.

Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in ""The Golden Age.""  She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen.  In an obvious effort to make her more ""identifiable"" to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film.  This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, ""regular"" commoner.  The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham.

Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being.  For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative.  Lucky for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene (although I do wish that he had toned down the music a scosh).

The first ""Elizabeth"" was a genuinely great film; yet, while this second installment may not be quite as ""golden"" as either its title or its pedigree might suggest, it's still hard to resist the lure of that Elizabethan magic.",1192233600,,3664,5.08
3044382,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate Blanchett has outdone even her own self. She has mastered a role that many actresses have also played,but SHE has become Her Royal Majesty Elizabeth even more so in Shekhar Kapur's newest installment ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE than she was in the first ELIZABETH in 1998. Blanchett is the perfect combination of ice and fire,vulnerability and bullheadedness,sensitivity and rageaholic and masculine and feminine to bring England's savior to the screen. Ms. Blanchett is so in control of herself that the corset  stays tied, but the fear and passion always dwell just below the surface. She is Queen. At one point,Blanchett,in a rage at the Spanish Ambassador screams ""I have a hurricane within me""....and she does,because Blanchett does.
Blanchett may well see her first BEST ACRESS Oscar this year. She has a Golden Globe and another win would be no surprise. This film has many magnificent qualities going for it,but ultimately it is Cate Blanchett's astute and finely tuned skills as an actress par excellent that carry this film to victory.
The year is 1585. Spain is eying the English throne. Sequestered up in Fartheringay Castle in Scotland,Mary Stuart the Queen of Scotland (an amazing and convincing Samantha Morton performance as always) also has her own designs to usurp Elizabeth,""that bastard whore."" Elizabeth is still advised by her chief counselor Francis Walsingham (again Geoffrey Rush reprising his brilliant role from the original).Walsingham still has safeguarded England as a Protestant country. Philip of Spain and Mary Stuart, though, are Catholic, and are set to unseat Elizabeth as Queen. But another usurper enters early on;a usurper of the heart,Sir Walter Raleigh (a well made up and swashbuckled Clive Owen).What Kapur does so beautifully with all of these players is to reveal the immense struggle that existed for Elizabeth not only from without, but also within. As Queen she must rule and be obeyed; but she is also a woman who has a heart, and that heart has denied itself many  of life's pleasures in order that she may ""be married to England."" This is the single brilliance of Kapur's film;though he needs to fit in historical facts to tell the actions that  do indeed occur between the countries and their monarchs, Kapur always keeps his focus always on Elizabeth, the ruler AND the woman. Even as Elizabeth ""allows"" (somewhat)her chief lady,Bess, to be wooed by Raleigh that she states, ""live my adventures through you"" or when Elizabeth, clad in armour atop a white steed proclaims to her troops, ""We shall not be defeated. Whether in Heaven or on the field of battle,(that was a loose translation!) we shall return victorious"" ,our focus is always on this miraculously strong and clever woman whose reign brought prosperity to England that would last three centuries. Kapur is confident in his Queen ""Cate"" to deliver the goods...and she does. Kapur has his Elizabeth calmly slip her royal signet ring onto her finger and has her in an almost Moses-like stance facing the raging winds and the thunder and lightening as she surveys, in her night clothes, the fighting ships in the Channel. Here Elizabeth is the warrior and the woman in one...powerful and mighty to withstand the Spanish onslaught.
The battle between the British and the Spanish Armada off the white cliffs of Dover is awesome and powerful to behold. The Channel is ablaze with blasting canons and ""fire ships"".One scene that Kapur vividly implanted in my mind is that of a white mare jumping from one of the Spanish ships. Kapur's camera follows the horse from underneath,swimming in the fiery waters, while Roman crosses and goblets fall to the Channel floor along with the bodies of dead warriors. This is a very arresting piece of camera work and symbolism of the Spaniard's defeat from which they never recovered.
I would be remiss if I did not mention the totally engrossing soundtrack that propelled all of the action forward while never over-asserting itself. That is the hallmark of a fine soundtrack.
Did I love it? ABSOLUTELY.
Would I see it again? DEFINITELY.
Will I purchase the DVD? Yep (but it is awesome on a big screen and will be significantly diminished!)
Will Cate Blanchett get her first BEST ACTRESS Academy Award? So far,POSITIVELY.
What else makes this movie magnificent? Costumes,Sound,Cinematography,Original Screenplay,Editing,supporting actors.
Yeah...it was THAT good! As a sequel, it fulfilled all my hopes.",1192233600,,4449,5.108516483516484
3044383,4,B000ZOXDG4,"When we last left Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett), she was young and inexperienced, struggling to come to terms with ruling a country. We now rejoin her in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" which begins well into her reign; beginning in the year 1585, the film chronicles the growing tension between England and Spain and culminates with a fierce sea battle. It also examines the relationship between Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), an adventurous seafarer. What we're presented with is less of an actual account and more of a dramatic love story, which basically means that it isn't even close to being historically accurate. But I guess that isn't a bad thing, considering the film's more creative aspects--""The Golden Age"" is a triumph of set and costume design, and the performances are top notch.

If only the story were at the same level. It would be too much to say that the plot isn't interesting; rather, it isn't interesting enough. Much of the material plays like a run of the mill romance, regardless of the time period. I just know that so much more defined Queen Elizabeth I, and I wish the filmmakers had given her character a little more depth. Not that she's completely shallow--if anything, quite a lot weighs heavy on her mind, not the least of which is her conniving cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton). Most of their rivalry stems from different religious faiths: Elizabeth is Protestant while Mary is Catholic. Hoping to take control of the throne, Mary conspires to have Elizabeth assassinated. Intercepting on Elizabeth's behalf is Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), the Queen's most trusted advisor.

On Mary's side is Philip II (Jordi Moll), King of Spain, who believes that Elizabeth has turned England into a godless country. He intends to conquer the Queen by sending a mighty armada, and the Spanish Inquisition along with it. Elizabeth understands that England's resources are depleted, as is its money; a counterattack will be much harder to plan and execute. Despite being incredibly strong-willed, something is holding her back, something that's diminishing her confidence. She seems to rely on Raleigh to soothe her, despite not knowing who he is or where he came from. All we do know is that he's arrived home from the New World, where he named a colony in honor of the Virgin Queen (Virginia). We've seen many films that make the Mysterious Stranger engaging or downright sexy--indeed, Raleigh is dashing, flirtatious, and bold. Just watch the way he presents potatoes and tobacco to Elizabeth.

Hoping to win favor with the Queen, Raleigh gets close to her favorite Lady in Waiting, Bess (Abbie Cornish), and it becomes obvious that his affections are divided between these two women. This plot device could have been much more interesting had it not been so clich; I've seen romantic conflict before, and it's usually reserved for escapist films. But ""The Golden Age"" is historical in context. I wanted more focus on the impending Spanish attack, especially since it was so intertwined with Elizabeth's assassination plot. The final major sequence does feature some battle, but not enough to be satisfying. It's as if the film fizzles out after spending so much time building itself up. It's not entirely a letdown, but it is a disappointment. This is especially true of Elizabeth's pre-battle speech: clad in armor, she rides a horse in front of her army while spewing encouraging sayings. I half expected her to say that the enemy may take their lives, but they'd never take their freedom.

Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. I greatly enjoyed Blanchett's performance; she gave Elizabeth a determined yet fragile quality that was compelling. I distinctly remember an emotional outburst aimed at the Spanish ambassador: ""I too can command the wind, sir!"" she screams. ""I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!"" This moment was raw and overwhelming, which was appropriate given her emotional state. I also remember a scene in an astrologist's lair showing Elizabeth's desperation. She clearly couldn't stand not knowing how everything would turn out. It was prophesized that two kingdoms would battle and only one would fall--the Queen would like nothing more than to hear that England will be victorious. Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed.

Yes, there is a lot to recommend about ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" and thank goodness that the good outweighs the bad. This is not a perfect film, but it can still get an audience from point A to point B. And it certainly is wonderful to look at; every shot is so richly detailed that you can't help but admire the work that went into it. The costumes are vivid, colorful, and intricate. The sets are lavish and bold, with practically every location dripping with colorful tapestries. The armada attack features a number of convincing special effects. Basically, everything felt real in terms of the film's look. The film's story, on the other hand, wasn't all that it could have been. There's a wealth of material on Queen Elizabeth I, and I can't help but feel that most of it was disregarded to make room for romantic elements. Romance works, but only to a point.",1192147200,,5234,4.956719817767654

3277991,3,B000ZOXDG4,"A huge disappointment after the first movie.  Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush were very good, and aged nicely, but I found many of the other characters somewhat caricatures (such as the Spanish ambassador and the young German prince).  Clive Owen did not seem at all the right person to play Raleigh, who was both a scholar and a swashbuckler.  Making Raleigh the focus of much of the movie, romantically involved with the queen and hero of the defeat of the armada (neither historically accurate - didn't the director know that Raleigh stayed on shore, and hadn't he ever heard of Howard of Effingham or Francis Drake?!), was unfortunate.  It meant that the movie largely glossed over the incredibly convoluted manoeuvers that Elisabeth was forced into when ruling over a small country still deeply divided between Protestant and Catholic, and with Catholic monarchs on the continent eager to conquer England either by marrying her or by invasion.
The sets are dramatic throughout, and the interview with the set designer was fascinating, but I couldn't help thinking that the Tudor palaces were not built to the same scale as the gothic cathedrals.  For example, Winchester has the longest nave in Europe, and it seems quite out of proportion when occupied by only one or two actors.",1502409600,,1286,4.990654205607477

In reality, Queen Mary preceded Elizabeth and died of natural causes. Elizabeth became queen by natural secession to the throne. Elizabeth did not chop off Mary's head as high drama in this film suggests.

3278176,1,B000ZOXDG4,"Why did they feel the need embellish Elizabeth's story?  She is the most interesting historical figure from the era, so much so, that it's called the Elizabethan era.  There was no need to glamorous her into a armor clad warrior princess.  And how did Raleigh take Drake's role during the Armada attacks?  Sorry Sir Francis, you just weren't sexy enough to make  the cut.  The real story would have been more interesting, focusing on Catholic vs. Protestant tensions in England, the series of skirmishes from Plymouth to Calais, and how Englad's victory changed the axis of power in Europe.  Instead we witness a goofy love triangle that has Elizabeth as a jilted woman rejected by Raleigh, policy decisions aided by the court astrologer and a Spanish Ambassador with his cadre of indignant dignitaries.  Cast Blanchett is ok as an actress, but whoever wrote the script ought to be drawn and quartered in good English fashion.",1483574400,,926,4.929032258064516

Helps to know a bit about English history to appreciate the events leading up to this woman's Queenship and her pain/struggle in power.

3278379,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I appreciate the craftsmen who labored to create this costume melodrama. All the locations are gorgeous with sublime architecture. Cate Blanchett is not appropriate for the lead role. The supporting actors, the walk-ons and the crowds have shining moments. One feels sympathy for Mary, Queen of Scots, and the young Isabella. The battle and defeat (how could this be a spoiler? It's elementary school, Watson) of the Spanish Armada due to ""God's wind"" is thought-provoking.",1481500800,,473,5.32

3278381,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Absolutely gorgeous film to behold - the sets, the costumes, the ships, everything is just beautiful.  The only thing I could be critical about, is the story.  Yes, it is about Queen Elizabeth but the film couldn't quite figure out how to tell this part of her story.  Are we watching a bio flick, a romance, a war film or a docudrama?  I guess it's a buffet of film, and it is simply beautiful.  Cate Blanchett is perfect royalty of the age.  Geoffrey Rush is brilliant.  Clive Owen is Clive Owen dressed an Elizabethan costume, and it works.  Samantha Morton, I think, is a real standout.  An excellent film!",1481155200,,610,4.522935779816514
3278382,4,B000ZOXDG4,"A movie with varied effects on the viewer. The cinematography, the acting, the period costumes are all wonderful. But there are considerable periods where nothing of great substance appears on screen, with the result that Boredom rules. On the other hand, there are periods, such as the actual engagement of the Spanish armada with the British navy, where the resulting scenes are truly spectacular.  Cate Blanchet as Queen Elizabeth with long and loose red hair and in full-body shiny panoply is a sight to behold. More bold strokes in the narrative and some judicious editing would have yielded a 5-star movie. As is, 3 1/2 stars sounds about right.",1481068800,,651,4.972477064220183
3278383,1,B000ZOXDG4,Ah yes the feminist rewrite history. Instead of the truth we have fantasy. You go girlllll.  Nope didn't watch it after I saw Cate in armor in the trailer.  What was the point. The first movie where Cate played Elizabeth was pretty good. This is so disgusting.,1480982400,,260,4.51063829787234
3278384,4,B000ZOXDG4,"A good portrayal of Elizabeth I---good, but not the best I've seen.  That honor goes to the Elizabeth (mini-series, perhaps as it was 4 hours long) played by Helen Miren (oops, I think I botched her name) anyway, her delivery of that role was absolutely glorious with Jeremy Irons as the Duke of Leister.  A brilliant movie that actually gave the queen's actual speech to the troops----where she said:  ""I know that I am a frail woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king---and a king of England.""

 I felt that movie was a bit more intimate---but, of course, that is just my opinion.  But, don't take my word for it---watch both films and see which is better.",1480636800,,667,4.471074380165289

Jeffry Rush plays a deliciously Machiavellian minister and Clive Owen is Sir Walter Raleigh.

Elizabeth wants a family and happiness, and her biological clock is ticking.  Raleigh looks like he might provide the ticket, but Rush's character manipulates the situation to destroy that chance.

In the end, our Queen determines that she already has a family -- Britain!

3278404,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Its hard to believe that I have walked by her grave in West Minister Abbey and stood where she is buried. Ive literally stood on top of her fathers remains, Henry VIII.  These are memorable visits but watching movies like these brings to life characters that are literally bones underneath the granite in which they are buried. History indeed that leaves us in awe.

I enjoyed the first Elizabeth film. Now we are ushered into another dramatized era entitled, Elizabeth: The Golden Age.  I will admit that I can enjoy a movie that has not received good reviews from critics or the audience for that matter. Of course, our tastes in entertainment and what floats our boat (or TV remote in this case) varies as much as our individual personalities.  Apparently, this is the case.

I've read critical reviews that the splendor, costumes, sets, and music were too sumptuous and weighed down the movie, distracting from the characters.  What hindered the critic from his enjoyment of this film, frankly enthralled me to no end. The sumptuousness of this version is what I enjoyed. I do not think that it detracts from Cate Blanchett in her portrayal as Elizabeth. Elizabeth in her own right is a complex character underneath her beautiful costume dresses, and the story is mostly focused on her struggles of remaining a powerful monarch, whose throne and life are under constant threat, yet struggling with the human need for love. This indeed is a Golden Age of her reign, which I think was the purpose behind all the sumptuous sets, etc.  I loved the soundtrack as well.

The only negative, of course, is that Geoffrey Rush is back as Sir Francis Walsingham, protecting Elizabeth1the queen, and torturing traitors left and right. Those scenes for me are the fast forwards or close your eyes and plug your ears moment. As you probably can tell from previous reviews, violence is not my forte.  Nevertheless, the truth of the matter is that torture happened and gruesome deaths awaited many of the main characters who played in history of ages past.  Even Sir Walter Raleigh eventually lost his head after the Queen died and his favor at court lessened.

Yes, I like this movie and all of its golden glory. Some of the best scenes are, of course, Elizabeth on her white horse and dressed in armor urging on her troops as the Spanish Armada approaches their coasts. Among all of these historical moments, I always find the religious aspect interesting, as well as each side prays to God for the victory believing it is heavens will for them to win.  Movies like these lead me to Wikipedia so I can read and learn the historical truth of these characters that lived and reigned in England.",1465689600,,2682,4.756465517241379
3278405,5,B000ZOXDG4,"I've seen this movie a bunch of times, and I love how it both humanizes the queen and exposes how the woman made herself into a Goddess-ruler.  I love some of the little things, like King Philip's quirky walk, and that the Infanta has a Queen Elizabeth doll.  The encounter between Blanchett and Redmayne is awesome in every sense of the word.  The looks on their faces before and after he fires at her are amazing for their intensity and the thoughts visibly racing through their minds.
I'm a wuss when it comes to violence and torture, so I had some problems with Walsingham's tasks, but totally love the portrait Rush gives of a devoted, intelligent, strategist-bodyguard.  His agony over having failed to see the trap Spain set for him is gorgeous, as is Blanchett's at having to execute her cousin.  Again small things grabbed me, like the reactions to catching her in treason from Mary of Scotland and her guard (Tom Hollander).
Generally a wonderful cast in a wonderfully directed epic of renaissance politics.",1465430400,,1017,4.788571428571428

3278412,1,B000ZOXDG4,"Oh, my. It's almost impossible to represent in a short review just how bad this is, because it's not comprehensively bad in fact, it had the potential to be good. During the first half hour or so, my wife was enthralled with the costumes, and I confess, some of them were impressive. And the earlier film about young Elizabeth Tudor's accession to the throne, also starring Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush, was pretty good. But the writing in this sequel is terrible, and this film generally reminds me of that Kardashians-Do-16th-Century-England show 'The Tudors'. Blech.

In a sense, this is the story of the Spanish Armada's defeat. But just as James Cameron in 'Titanic' took one of the most gripping and thoroughly-documented events in history and, feeling that it wasn't gripping ENOUGH, goosed it by fabricating a clich love story, here in 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age', we get the story of a fantastic maritime victory (or defeat, depending on your perspective) but the actual stuff done in boats is pretty silly, and most of the movie is soap-opera quality romance. Who knew that history could be this embarrassing?

Final note: No Shakespeare in this golden age. So what's the point?",1464048000,,1187,4.959798994974874

3278414,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Note:  It is difficult to rate literally works, such as this due to the subjective nature of the viewer/reader/listener.  My review is based on my own experience with a multitude of similar works.

'Elizabeth, the Golden Age' is the sequel to 'Elizabeth,' also with Cate Blanchet.  This is not a write-up of the first part, but it is difficult to consider in pieces.  Akin to reviewing 'The Godfather, Part II' without at least its part 1, in my opinion.

To my knowledge, there are three primary English-speaking movies dealing with Elizabeth's the First of England as its central theme.  This one, the Masterpiece Theater production 'Elizabeth, The Virgin Queen' with Anne-Marie Duff, and Elizabeth I with Helen Mirren.

Each of the three works brings an important contribution to my contemporary modern view of who Elizabeth was.  I am sure that it far from the real person.  Each also provides a perspective that is beautifully achieved and unique.

This work with Cate Blanchet is beautifully executed and as expected incredibly staged and prepared.  The story is well told and each primordial  element (director, music, setting, etc.) is first rate.

The drama and passion of certain events might be a bit exaggerated for those of us who also are history buffs, but as a movie it is worth my dime and almost expected.

One important aspect to mention is that it has English subtitles.  I find this important to understand British-language productions.  I know the Masterpiece Theater does not have subtitles and still find parts difficult to comprehend.

In summary:  I believe this one to be the most mature (by Hollywood standards) of the three works I have watched.  Helen Mirren's is definitely a close second.  For some reason I still enjoy the first part better than the second, but as I mentioned they are both part of the same people telling this story.",1463788800,,1867,4.919871794871795

3278493,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Beautiful ! Another masterpiece by director Shekhar Kapur. I loved the first one, because it was the story of her coming into power. In this one, she's older and fully involved in complicated political situations. She has matured and is thoroughly involved in totally being Elizabeth the Queen. The frivolity of the first story is not there anymore. Things have become serious, but she goes on to overcome all the obstacles that get in her way and does a splendid job of taking out the Spanish and eventually turning England into a world power. Once again, each scene is beautiful and here her costumes are even more gorgeous than in the earlier film. When she goes out to speak to her troops, dressed in armor and, for the first time not riding side saddle, sitting on that white horse and wearing a long white cape and with her long red hair flowing in the wind, she looks like a goddess. You can see the admiration in her men's eyes and their morale becoming stronger.

3278502,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Since I have a deep love for Queen Elizabeth and everything that she had to go through, I I hate and love this movie at the same time. I understand and accept that it's a movie, and it does not all have to be based on facts, but do you lure people in. But some of the inaccuracies is what made me hate it. The things that made me love it where of course all of the beautiful gowns.

I do wish that they would have changed Queen Elizabeth character just a tiny little bit so that she wouldn't seem so shallow. Because if all of the history books I have ever read depicted her the way that this movie had, I probably would have only read one and been done with it. I am kind of glad that I was born in this time, but I still think that part of me would have done really well in those days also. How cool would it have been to battled the Queen of Scots was Queen Elizabeth?!",1438819200,,872,3.926553672316384
3278503,4,B000ZOXDG4,Excellent sequel.  Not sure if King Phillip was that unstable.  Hollywood has a tendency to bash the Catholic Church,1438300800,,116,5.052631578947368

I found this movie to be very entertaining on the totally ""entertaining"" spectrum. Very colorful and fashionable (did they really dress like that?). There might, in fact, be some authenticity and true history here, also, but it's pretty much hidden and packaged otherwise. All in all a great chick flick.",1437696000,,449,4.921052631578948

3278531,3,B000ZOXDG4,"ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE

 Director Shekhar Kapur has brought back Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush to pick up the story of Queen Elizabeth some ten years after his 1998 film, Elizabeth.  Blanchett and Elizabeth are both somewhat older in the new film.
  Blanchett is properly queenly.  Rush, reprising his role as Walsingham, the queen's minister and spymaster, does his usual workmanlike job.  The impossibly dashing Clive Owen brings the myth of Sir Walter Raleigh to life.  Abbie Cornish, as Raleigh's love interest, adds the necessary eye candy.
 The problem with this film is that it is neither fish nor fowl.  We have murder, an assassination attempt and torture.  We have execution by rope and by ax.  We have beautifully done slow motion mayhem when the English navy battles the Spanish Armada in the English Channel.  We have Cate Blanchett, who wears armor like no other actress, making a wonderfully inspirational speech to her outnumbered troops.
 Alas, all is for naught.  Too much viewing time is filled with the emotional wrestling of the Virgin Queen.  Or what the writers imagine her emotions to be.  The digressions into the Spanish and Scotts courts add nothing to the narrative or the psychic tension of Elizabeth's soul.  It succeeds neither as a chick flick nor as grand historical drama.
 The acting is fine; some of Blanchett's oratory is truly grand.  The costumes and sets are true to period.  In spite of the excellent cast and good efforts of all involved, I can give this film no more than two and a half saw blades.",1424390400,,1547,4.873076923076923

3278534,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I loved the drama and the visuals to the movie, but disliked how the battle scenes were not detailed. There was no display of tactics in the battles and how exactly they were victorious. I thought they could have done some background more on pirates during that time period in the New World and some of the conflicts that occurred there. Also, It is documented that Ivan the Terrible wanted to marry Elizabeth and have a military alliance with her, but in the movie he get about 3 seconds of time! The most powerful Russian ruler who was a genius tactician and who was undefeated in all of his campaigns, conquering massive swaths of land. At least have a scene about an ambassador's visit and something with Russia... anyway I would have taken the creative license and a more global view focusing more on pirates, and Russia. Taking this in mind, I was annoyed by seeing Elizabeth as some bipolar worry-wort crying about how Spain will most definately destroy her when in fact in was the opposite-- England had superior cannon technology and ships. My final qualm with the movie was the complete lack of any scene taking place in the Spanish court or mainland or any scene in Rome. This makes it seem too detached. For what it was, it was ok but doesn't satisfy my taste. Without the visuals it would be 1 star.",1423699200,,1312,4.563559322033898

Add to that, Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary to the Queen Elizabeth and popularly remembered as her ""spymaster"", demonstrated the true nature of political intrigue, with its innumerable shifting angles as well as facets, such as turning on a friend that became involved in intrigue and even more so with respect to Mary, Queen of Scots. This movie is so good that... my opinion only... other films as The Virgin Queen (1955 and 2005), Elizabeth Rex (2004), Gloriana  (1984 and 2000), Elizabeth  (2000), Elizabeth R (1971) or Young Bess  (1953) don't even come close to showing the true Virgin Queen of Old England!",1417737600,,841,5.079710144927536

While history has been massaged and shuffled around a bit, it has been done for dramatic purpose. It marks the beginning of the great British Empire's expansion. The movie does show that it wasn't that much fun to be a Royal (in fact it was more hazard prone and deadly then they show). If Spain's monarch seems a little over the top, do some research on the families of European monarchs of the 14th to 17th centuries then you will know how the French Revolution came about.

She lived the first part of her life with the threat of death hanging over her head was real and could come at any moment.  Also the religious separation of the kingdom at that time and how when she finally did become queen, she was urged constantly to return the kingdom to the Catholic religion with no tolerance for anything else.

3278593,2,B000ZOXDG4,The costumes are stunning. So I suggest you put on the mute button and freeze the frame to look at details of the costumes. The storytelling is some of the worse I've ever seen on film. This film is more an orgy of images. I found it difficult to understand what the heck was going on for half the film. At that point I stopped and went online to read a synopsis of the so called plot. Cate Blanchett can do no wrong as an actress. But that's not enough. So in a nut shell: No story. Pretty costumes.

3278647,3,B000ZOXDG4,"This movie has pretty much the same Controlling Idea as the previous Elizabeth movie: that devotion and inner strength is required to protect one's country. But this movie does a way better job of proving the idea. Even though as queen, Elizabeth is far removed from the physical battle and spy vs spy action, her actions (and inactions) drive every turning point forward. When she wavers, England suffers, when she is strong, England triumphs. This makes for a very satisfying ending where she rallies her troops to defeat the Spanish armada in one of England's greatest naval victories in history. Great movie.

The packaging on it should let the viewer know this, instead you learn of it in the BONUS section of the DVD. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress, who can transform herself in such a way as to put you in the  space of the person she's playing; and she did so with this historical character.. AS most, I've heard of her or read something about her, but in this movie--though embellished; It's Elizabeth you focus on and feel for. You see the responsiblity her life contained, the stress and her strengths and weaknesses. The movie has historical background, but it is Character driven, so that is what a viewer who watches this movie should really bend toward; and it would be good to view the first part first, it would put some continuity to this one.",1371600000,,873,4.490566037735849

Action, intrigue, excellent acting, incredibly beautiful sets, camera shots, lighting, etc....  If i could improve the movie, I would have made it a tad more clear as far as the plot, (i.e. WHY was Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots in ""jail"" in the first place?) but if you can  bear not quite understanding everything, it was fabulous.  Love, adventure, etc.... Just beware of some particulary gory scenes,
as torture was commonplace in those days.  Definite parental discretion advised on that.  Also a vague sexual scene, although there was no nudity.  Also great for fans of ocean movies: great scenes at the end, of adventurous boating and war as the Spanish Armada attacked Enland.",1363392000,,950,4.75
3278662,5,B000ZOXDG4,"While this may have taken a few liberties with history, this was still excellently done as Cate reprises her role as Queen Elizabeth as she settles into her duties at court. There are still intrigues--and a war with Spain in the offing, and a bittersweet affair with Sir Walter Raleigh, a handsome rogue who fell in love with a different Bess, all while romancing the Queen and seeking favor. The largest intrigue is with her prisoner, Mary Queen of Scots and her upcoming execution. King Phillip of Spain uses this execution as an excuse to launch an all out war with England and there is many an anxious moment as the Queen knows the Armada is coming, and can do little to stop it on her own. Her words of prophecy to the snide Ambassadors from Spain however, do come true as both fire and storm contrive to humble Phillip as he is left bankrupt when the Armada fails to deliver the sure victory he thought he had.

This follow up, Elizabeth: the Golden Age, does not meet that level of quality in either ideation or direction.  While I think Cate Blanchett did a wonderful job in both movies, the second film had a more 2-dimensional set of characters.  This is especially evident with the representation of the Spanish Catholic characters - most especially Spain's King, who is about as stock a villain as I can imagine -- I half expected him to swirl his mustache.  As someone who spent years in Renaissance and Reformation Studies, I am no fan of the Spanish Empire of that time period.

3278690,1,B000ZOXDG4,"I liked the first Elizabeth film. There is no way this sequel could have been written by the same writer. Rather than a story; this film is a series of images with weird music, and disconnected, meaningless, dialogue which does not connect into a story. The lavish costumes and sets give you the impression the film is going to tell a story, but it never does. I read the reviews and was expecting an okay movie that was not quite as good as the first. However, it was far worse than I expected.

There is a subplot about an assassination, but we only see a small piece of the story, and are left with more questions than answers.

There is a subplot about the Spanish Armada, and there is no story here at all; just images and weird music..

There is a subplot about palace romance. You get a beginning and end with no middle, and no rhyme or reason. ""Weird"" is the best word to describe the script. Some new-wave artist is presenting us images with weird music, and a dialogue intended to match the weird mood of the images and music; rather than tell a story.

There is more story in the reviews than in the film. There is no story in this film at all. The writer should never have been paid, because he never wrote any story. The writer should be flogged, keel-hauled, and stretched on the rack for ripping us all off; along with every reviewer who gave this more than one star, because they did not want to admit they had been swindled.",1341964800,,1441,4.345724907063197
3278691,1,B000ZOXDG4,"The first film had many inaccuracies yet managed to hold itself together in quite an arresting way. The Golden Age is equally full of historical holes yet fails abominably. (The absence of Dudley and Essex, two key players at Elizabeth's court, did not go unnoticed.) The reason for this is, I think, less to do with factual errors in major historical events--such as details of the Armada--and more to do with inaccurate characterization. Clive Owen is decidedly charmless as Walter Raleigh, who should have been vain, captivating, and merciless. Cate Blanchett projects neither the majesty nor the flirtatiousness of Elizabeth, preferring to foghorn her lines like a novice transvestite. Laurence Fox's Christopher Hatton doesn't dance once. I know very little about Philip II, but that is ultimately unnecessary since he utters the same camp threats in every scene. The music is over-the-top and irritating. The writing is so preposterous that it's almost an afterthought. The camerawork largely consists of slow-motion close-ups or revolving shots reminiscent of fashion adverts. These techniques are used throughout the entirety of Mary Queen of Scots last segment, making it painfully melodramatic. The director also relies several times on the ""God's-eye-view"" shots he employed in the first film. I wished several times that God's eye would unhinge and squash Blanchett, thereby ending her strutting second-rate drag-queenery once and for all. And was I the only one that shivered when the film went chillingly jingoistic near the end?

The movie as stand-alone entertainment is far superior to the first movie in this series, Elizabeth. The pace of the movie never lagged and the scenery was splendid as it portrayed England during a turbulent period of its history.

As I expected, Cate Blanchett did a marvelous job portraying the queen as did the other actors in their roles. The visual effects of the battle with the Spanish Armada were very well done and the scene of Elizabeth encouraging her troops before the battle almost brought tears to my eyes. The audio and video quality is both excellent.

There are a number of special features which include one rather grotesque shot of a decapitated head. One problem we encountered involved understanding all the words; it seemed as if the music got louder as the actors started whispering making it very difficult to catch all they were saying. We solved that problem be activating English subtitles; after that we didn't miss a word.

You see a lot of people hating Elizabeth with little or no explanation as to why other than the over used bastard, whore, heretic reasons/descriptions. Caricatures is a word to sum up all of the performances.  The Golden Age is a woefully poor sequel to a movie that was sheer pageantry.  Cate Blanchett in one of the featurettes said that she felt that she had gotten it all wrong.

The current ""no child left behind,"" uneducated generation excepted, most other kids learned about Elizabethan England and the Armada in the 7th grade, I know I did. This film was accurate about the armada being wrecked in a storm and that's about it. The rest was pure disappointing fantasy. How on earth could a director or producer expect an audience to buy into this already well known event in English history? The real Queen Elizabeth powdered her face white in the fashion of the day. One of her favorite swear phrases was, ""God's death!"" Where were these? And the sight of Elizabeth in Joan-of-Arc armor rousing the troops was actually too comedic for any halfway educated audience to swallow. The writers need to find another line of work. Truck repair or WalMart cashier come to mind. The director used every directing cliche' in the book. A real hack job. The Spaniards were depicted as Darth Vader villains, with dark clothes and mean looking faces.

Nothing was good about this flop except for some of Cate Blanchett's acting, the costumes, and the cinematography. Those are the only reasons it deserves even one star

But then, I really shouldn't complain because I bought this DVD stinker in a Goodwil store for 99 cents. The Cover art and data indicated it was history. I now know why it was there. I just regret wasting my time watching it.

The Script:
A confused history lesson delves into campy soap operatic tones that snuff out the more interesting bits.

The Direction:
A total step backward from its grittier 1998 predecessor, Kapur tries to add too much gloss and loses his core along the way.

The Acting:
Clive Owen is a joke, Abbie Cornish can't act, Cate Blanchett is shocking bland and unfocused and Samantha Morton steals the whole show with a handful of scenes (she's amazing).

The Technical:
Some overblown visuals look cheesy and fake, but the costumes are divine and the texture of the set pieces are organic and splendid to look at.

In the end I hope that they stop here.  I loved the 1998 film, and Blanchett in it, but this was a disaster that failed on nearly every level, the Oscar winning costumes aside.",1330905600,,940,4.5266272189349115

Moreover, the absurd portrayal of King Philip II was that of a Darth Vader character saturated in his evil plans.

The propagandistic English historical establishment is the best in the world at manipulation via mindless entertainment, discrediting other nations, diminishing the history of others while inflating their own, and distorting Historical facts. They, along with the Dutch (research the Paper Wars against Spain in the 16th century) have been masters at the art of deception and propaganda for more than 500 years.

3278708,2,B000ZOXDG4,"After viewing this movie, I was greatly disappointed not just by the lack of historical accuracy but also by other things that are important for example the script, the filmography, the plot, the sets and most importantly the lack of action.

In a matter of fact, when I think about it. I'm not exactly sure who is the target audience here, it's not history buffs, nor action lovers or fans of soap operas dramas. I am still confused as to what group of people I would recommend this movie.

I don't normally give a movie 2 stars unless I had to and I tried to see some redeeming qualities to make up for my disappointment and eventually I did somehow for example the boat scene where Elizabeth is sitting with her ladies is beautiful for example albeit inappropriate (historically) for Tudor England and some other brief moments like the Spanish Armada sailing but that's it and quite frankly it wasn't enough to make me change my opinion after almost 2 hours of viewing

Why precisely I give this 2 stars ?

1-Historical Inaccuracies aside (I'll come to these in a moment) the directing was odd and made the film rather confusing. Jump Cuts, shots from odd angles and there was even a scene where Elizabeth was walking with her minsters and the camera decides to shoot that from the ceiling for no apparent reason.

2-The customs, I know they are pretty and the colors are full of life and glee but aside from the ruffs (which aren't even accurate and resemble wires more than fabric) the dresses look more suitable for Venice rather then England. Another thing that bugged me was Cate Blanchette's hair style. While the real Elizabeth undoubtedly wore wigs (not to cover her bald hair like some people think but to cover grey hair and because wigs were in fashion) was it necessary to decorate it with feathers in almost every scene ? She looks like a peacock ! It's impossible.

3-Manners and Behaviors, people didn't behave that way in Elizabethan England, they didn't talk that way either. The Script is very disappointing (I wasn't accepting something out of Shakespeare mind you) but at least something sophisticated enough and still understandable. The actors don't have a chance to shine because the script is so limited. In another scene Elizabeth the Queen is sitting on her throne while one of her ladies-in-waiting who is a dwarf no offense intended is sitting on her lap. Will the real Elizabeth or any Queen for that matter allow her lady in waiting dwarf or not to set on her lab in a public ceremony ? I just had to laugh at how ridicules that scene is! In another scene there is a feast and a group of painted performers came half naked (that wasn't the kind of entertainment at court that scene quite frankly fits more perfectly in Arabian Nights).

4-Historical inaccuracies finally we are getting there !

Elizabeth hated women (she trusted a few, including her governor Kat Ashley who was a mother to her and Dudley's sister who nursed her during small pox as well as another lady in waiting which name escapes me) as for the rest she hated them ! If you don't believe me read any biography about her. She broke a woman's finger once because she married secretly, she imprisoned another in the tower for the same reason, I wouldn't be surprise if she banished others too. She was all vicious to women while all charm to men. She preferred the company of men and was more comfortable with them and didn't make it a secret. So, for her to be running around with her ladies in waiting is untrue. She was a great flirt and surrounded herself with members of the opposite sex.

There are many key figures missing in this movie. Where is Essex ? Where is Cecil ? Where is Drake ? And most importantly where is Robert Dudley ? (Queen Elizabeth's favorite who might or might not be her one true love) all is gone.

By the time of the Armada Elizabeth wasn't entertaining any suitors. She was in her 5os, her ministers already knew she wouldn't get married as the possibility of an heir is no longer valid. Also, Elizabeth might be capable of Political Brutality almost like any other Politician however she was quite shaken by Mary Queen of Scots Execution. Or at least pretended to be Quite Shaken there is no emotion whatsoever shown in here. Even in that Kissing scene between Elizabeth and Raleigh she seems rather stiff while we know that she's a woman of Passion.

Cate Blanchette is an excellent actress but I'm afraid that's not enough to save this movie. The dialogue, the inaccuracies, the gloomy gothic sets that are so dark it's impossible to see who's doing what at times. If you'll watch this film then let it be for pure entertainment not for History please. There is NO History to be learnt here if you want you can always pick a book or use Wikipedia.

For a better adoption watch the Helen Mirren's version Elizabeth 2005. It's more accurate and the script is intelligent and witty.",1316995200,,4915,4.610983981693364

Practically everything Elizabeth did and said was written down in her own time. It is very easy to follow history and produce a thrilling story about these events, but this director decided to give us lies and dress up the lies in his concept of art. Got news for him--the art lies in story telling, not dressing it up with costumes, dark moody sets, and special effects. Everything here is overdone. Poor writing with unrealistic sappy dialogue and historical lies cannot be saved with expensive (but gaudy) costumes and fancy camera work. The truth in this story would have been far more interesting than this ego-driven director's vision. For instance, did you know that Elizabeth refused to pay many of the sailors who fought and risked their lives to save her royal butt from the Spanish? Many of them died later of diseases and starvation while living in filth, but her royal partying went on.  But if you wish to find far greater evil, read the histories of the Borgia and Medici popes. This movie was long, tedious, poorly scripted, overdone, boring, sappily dialogued, ego-driven, and mostly lies.

Following Queen Elizabeth in her middle years this films explores the romance of Sir Walter Raleigh, the Catholic assassination plots, Mary Queen of Scots treason and the Spanish Armada. The costumes and sets are stunning and are the key aspects that really makes this film. Blanchett's performance is as good as the first film (which you don't have to have seen to enjoy this film) and the supporting cast do an ample job at providing the drama and intrigue to the storylines. Clive Owen is especially good as the lovable rogue, Raleigh, and is very credible after seeing him in less impressive roles in other films. The veracity of the history may be in doubt, but the adventure and drama in the story more than make up for this and as long as you are aware of it, this film makes for a couple of hours of good viewing. Worth a try if you enjoyed the first instalment.

3278721,4,B000ZOXDG4,"This movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, as it's dense on politics at times, and gruesome at others. However, for those reviewers who claim this film demonstrates religious bigotry, I beg to differ. Written and visual portraits from this time period reveal that the Spanish did indeed behave and dress the way they appeared in the film. Dour, black-wearing, bearded, somber, and convinced that Elizabeth was an Infidel who deserved to be destroyed. In addition, Philip II's infirmities and strange physique were portrayed as they truly were at the time; the House of Hapsburg and its various branches was becoming so inbred in early modern Europe that many of its members were physically deformed. This is no different than discussing how that the House of Tudor, for whatever physical/genetic reasons, clearly had reduced fertility during Henry VIII's time and afterward -- and saying so is hardly anti-Protestant prejudice. These are historical facts, and histories of the time period make them abundantly clear.

The movie does not try to absolve Elizabeth from all religious prejudice; indeed, it does show her ministers' gruesome vengeance  -- with confessions extracted from torture -- against Catholics suspected of plotting her demise. However, it is important to keep in mind that context of the times, and that the religious wars were brutal across Europe. Compared to the Spanish Inquisition, Elizabethan England was far less violent.

Her reign was also less violent than her father Henry VIII's by far -- he whose rule saw widespread oppression and terrorism against Catholics and Protestants alike, depending on how the religious/political winds were blowing across Europe at any given moment, and given the views and actions of Henry's enemies/allies/wives/lovers of any given moment.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that even the most devout of Catholics of today would still claim that it would have been better for autocratic Spain, which had practically NO democratic tradition, and in which the Inquisition against Protestants, Jews, Muslims, accused heretics, etc. etc. was in full swing, to have conquered England in 1588.... The movie is also very useful in demonstrating how Elizabeth's victories and her enduring rule were in large part a result of her turning herself into a quasi-religious icon for her realm -- something the first film in the series makes even more clear -- and the price she had to pay for that decision. Subtle people will detect the subtleties in the film, and appreciate them. People with a major religious axe to grind, however, probably will not.",1266710400,,2605,5.180522565320665

With covert intrigue, Spain sets a trap for the Queen and her principal secretary, Walsingham, using as a pawn Elizabeth's cousin Mary Stuart, who's under house arrest in the North. The trap springs, and the armada sets sail, to rendezvous with French ground forces and to attack. During these months, the Virgin Queen falls in love with Walter Raleigh, keeping him close to court and away from the sea and America. Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Blanchett is magnificent in her strange, enigmatic and multi-dimensional character, constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counter-plotting to take her down at her Court, in her government, and, from foreign lands. This movie does entertain, sending me on a delightfully exciting spell-bound journey to separate legend and myths from historical facts.

3278723,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I loved the first ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett, and so was eager to see the follow-up.

It doesn't compare.

It is gorgeous in design and costumes.  For the most part the acting is good.  But the plot and the writing are stiff.

Everything is a set piece.  People simply pose, deliver their lines, and swirl away.  This makes the movie curiously static.

There isn't much interaction between characters.  This becomes blatant with Clive Owen.  I have heard Owen declare in an interview that actors don't have to show ""emotion.""  Well, in this one, he certainly doesn't.  He has two expressions: Amused in a Superior Way, and Sternly Serious.  These get old fast, and contribute nothing.  Owen is a kinetic actor like Tom Cruise, and when he is not in motion he is dull, almost embarrassing.

Geoffrey Rush is also wasted in this one.  He puts in his cameos and vanishes.

Worst of all, the plot jigsaw never fits together.  There is a vague suspense theme, involving Mary Stuart and Phillip II, but it is so un-suspenseful that it hardly makes sense.  There is even a suspense underplot, involving the Walsingham brothers, but again, it is limp to the point of sleepy.

3278727,1,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth- the Golden Age"" is a star-studded, well-acted, visually sumptuous cinematic hate crime. Surpassing even the Davinci Code in historical fabrication, coarse stereotypes and anti-Catholic bigotry, ""Elizabeth"" has set a new low in the use of film to demonize, mock and slander a group of people. One would have to go back, perhaps, to ""The Jew Suss"" to see a film that would equal ""Elizabeth"" in religious hatred. Perhaps Shekhar Kapur's next project will be to bring ""Maria Monk"" to the screen.

From the film's introductory assertion that ""Philip II, a devout Catholic, has plunged Europe into war"", educated men will guffaw at the shameless lies this movie tries to have us swallow. The cartoonish, Manichean caricatures that populate this movie are enough to condemn it: weird, cadaverous Spaniards, Jesuit assassins, treasonous Catholics, a creepy Spanish Infanta who plays with an Elizabeth voodoo doll, and a vacant-eyed Philip II who limps about gibbering insanely. On the other hand we have the thoroughly modern Gloriana, the liberated woman and good boss, who indulgently winks at her equally likable subordinates' slip-ups and looks darned saucy in a fabulous wardrobe and a big red wig.

But the sins of this movie don't stop at characterizations that would have been thought shallow in the silent film era. Most shameless of all is the portrayal of Elizabeth as an advocate for freedom and religious tolerance. She is indeed famously recorded as having said that she had ""no desire to make windows into men's souls"". To be sure, a Catholic under the Elizabethan regime was ""free"" to believe whatever he wanted, so long as his faith stayed within the confines of his mind. If he didn't publicly abjure the Pope and the old Faith, worship and live as a Protestant in all externals, and keep his Catholicism completely secret, persecution and death awaited. The fate of St. Edmund Campion discloses, in bloody microcosm, the reality of Catholic life under Elizabeth. Arrested for preaching England's ancient Gospel and administering the Sacraments to England's persecuted Catholic majority, Campion was racked, tortured, hanged to the point of death, disemboweled and castrated while alive, then beheaded and quartered. Such was the vaunted tolerance of Bloody Bess for those who resisted the ersatz, government-issued religion.

Perhaps the current decline and collapse of the practically pagan English ""church"" is yet another proof of the old saying that the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small. The Anglican compromise was an unnatural and insupportable belief system imposed upon an unwilling people, and like all bad ideas, has produced bad fruit: Deism, indifferentism, innumerable sects, naturalism and ultimately atheism. For hundreds of years, and for some inscrutable purpose of God, this alien system was permitted to flourish in England but now seems to be approaching its end. Whither the English go now, to the Faith of their ancestors or down some other path, God only knows.",1261094400,,3031,5.245360824742268
3278728,2,B000ZOXDG4,"This movie has been on my to-view list for too long.  So now, I broke down and rented.
Phillip II raises an army in Spain to attack the Protestant England, ruled by Elizabeth I.  Elizabeth struggles to balance the Catholics and the Protestants in England, and to face off against the Spanish Armada.
The costumes, sets, and scenery are goregous, stunning.  I can't tell you how often I would look at Cate Blanchett and think she was Elizabeth (in her costumes, she looks a lot like the paintings I've seen of Elizabeth I).  The same goes for Samantha Morton as Mary.  Absolutely stunning!
I think Cate did a fair job as Elizabeth, I enjoyed watching Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, and Samantha Morton was excellent as Mary.
As I'm sure you could tell, I had trouble giving a plot to this story.  Much of it seems to revolve around the teenaged antics of Elizabeth falling head over heels for Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), who only has eyes for Bess, the Queen's attendant.  While I am sure that Elizabeth wasn't the portrait of perfection that we receive from history, I got tired of the melodrama of the romantic angle (hence the title of this review).  It feels like a blasted soap opera.  And it interrupts the conflict between Spain and England, making that storyline almost impossible to understand.
And the pacing!  So slow, so boring, so tedious!  So confusing!  All these events...Mary's treason, Sir Francis Walsingham intercepting messages.  It might make sense if it weren't so hidden, so buried underneath the romantic triangle.
Cate Blanchett attempts to do a good job with Elizabeth and she does make the queen appear strong, but at times, she makes Elizabeth too human, whining, complaining in front of her courtiers, in front of the people she's supposed to govern, who are supposed to respect her.  What kind of woman can command admiration to be called the Virgin Queen if she is angsting over Raleigh being with Bess?  Clive Owen is forgettable as Raleigh, Abbie Cornish will never win an award of any kind for her ""performance"" as Bess, and Jordi Moll&agrave; as the Spanish King just cements in our heads that Spain = Bad.
Lastly, historical inaccuracies abound, even to a history dunce such as myself.  Wasn't Mary Elizabeth's sister, not cousin?  Didn't she die before Elizabeth took the throne?  Would Elizabeth really go all Eowyn on us and ride out Theoden style to meet her army?  I understand that movies don't have to be historically accurate 100% of the time, but I can only suspend my disbelief so much.
Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  Perhaps history buffs might be able to glance over the inaccuracies (probably not) or maybe the uninitiated can become interested in the story (if they like romance triangles), but other than that.  I don't know.  But I know how I feel, and I didn't enjoy it.  2 stars for Cate Blanchett's attempts, Geoffrey Rush, and the gorgeous costumes.

3278731,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate Blanchett alone makes this movie fantastic.  Her characterization of Queen Elizabeth is genius - every cell in her body becomes the powerful queen.  Cate Blanchett shows Queen Elizabeth's ability to change ""masks"" -  The queen who holds court shows her intelligence, strength, ruthlessness, yet has a sense of ironic humor.  The queen in private shows her emotions, love, and fears.  There are threats all around her.

Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) appears on the scene and throws his cloak below her feet so she does not step in a puddle.  His dashing ways attract her as someone different from the boring duties of the Court.  He tells of exciting adventures with savages, brings strange exotic items from the New World:  potatoes and tobacco as well as a few Native Americans. her Court.  Sir Walter distracts and intrigues her - makes her weak, she knows her rules  as Queen, yet she needs him near.  He notes that he has named territory after the Virgin Queen ""Virginia.""

She wants to focus on her responsibilities instead of personal matters.  Skullduggery and
treachery is all around.  There are fights on what religion should be practiced - an Armada that carries the Spanish Inquisition is coming to England to crush out the Protestants and make Catholicism the national religion. She depends on her advisor Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to flush out her betrayers.  Her own cousin, Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) is plotting to have Elizabeth assassinated.

Again, Cate Blanchett is riveting as Queen Elizabeth, and the movie revolves around her role.  The movie is excellent and the beautiful costumes, landscapes and sets frame the actress well.",1254700800,,1673,5.065934065934066
3278732,3,B000ZOXDG4,"Here we have a wonderfully produced semi-epic film, with sprawling scenes... film art at its best; however, it really drags in terms of action.

In a more positive defense of the film, if you are really into historically-based movies, I think you'll enjoy this one a great deal. But like similar productions such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becket/dp/B00007G1WH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becket</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-the-Thousand-Days-Mary-Queen-of-Scots/dp/B000RF7XYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, in an effort to accurately convey the tale the details here prey heavily upon the final achievement.

The Story: It's all about the reign of Elizabeth I (1533-1603), daughter of Henry [Tudor] VIII and one of England's most renowned and controversial queens. There's a particular focus on Elizabeth's troubles with both Spain and with the large Catholic population of her country. (Henry VIII had been excommunicated by Pope Clement VII. The King had married the sensual Anne Boleyn, [mother of Elizabeth I] absent the Pope's approval of an annulment from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then Henry subsequently established the Protestant Church of England.) The story also involves Elizabeth's rocky relationship with her Catholic cousin and rival for the British throne, Mary Queen of Scots who was ultimately executed by a malevolent Elizabeth.

I feel additionally compelled to remark that the casting for this movie was near-perfect as were the indoor sets and outdoor locations. For this specific reason, I would especially recommend that you view the movie in its widescreen version on the biggest widescreen television you can find.

In summary, if history is your thing, you'll likely award this 1 hour and 55 minute film four or five stars. If not, you'll probably be bored to tears.

I just wish Hollywood would make a real good movie about this subject without taking sides and portraying both the English and the Spaniards as accurate as possible the way they really were along with the real reasons why the armada campaign came to be.......The real reason for the Spanish Armada wasntareligious e, it was a response from the Spanish to the continous piratical attacks to spanish possessions from english buccaneers backed by Queen Elizabeth.",1244246400,,995,4.824561403508772
3278735,3,B000ZOXDG4,"At once more ambitious and less intriguing than its predecessor, Elizabeth: The Golden Age certainly isn't the abject disaster reviewers claimed on its theatrical release, although it's not nearly as engrossing as the original. Unfortunately, while Shekhar Kapur opens up the action and opts for a much lighter palate this time round, with at least a trailer's worth of striking visuals, the results are not particularly compelling. By focusing on the best-known part of the Virgin Queen's reign there's less of the constant sense of danger that marked its predecessor even though it amps up the threat by pitting her not against her own court but the might of the Spanish Empire and its Armada. Yet, being a sequel, it adheres to the `the same but different,' and there's certainly a strong element of dj vu: the dastardly Catholics are still plotting her death, with Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton taking on the Daniel Craig and Fanny Ardant roles of Jesuit hitman and conspiring Scottish queen. And, as before, history isn't well served, with the film offering the notion that Philip of Spain conspired to force Elizabeth to execute Mary Queen of Scots to give him an excuse for a holy war.

The script certainly could have been better, running down rather than gaining momentum as the Armada approaches and dropping the ball in many of the obvious slamdunks. Certainly if you're going to omit Elizabeth's famous ""I may have the body of a weak and foolish woman, but I have the heart of a king"" you need to come up with something with more guts and bravado than the tired horseback speech she gives to rally her troops. Even worse, the Armada itself is something of an anti-climax. The almost painting-like CGi effects aren't as much a problem in a film as occasionally stylised as this as are the all-too obvious budget limitations that reduce it to the odd running commentary that makes it somewhat akin to listening to a football game on the radio.

Performances are highly variable. Blanchett is suitably regal in the lead, with Geoffrey Rush and David Threlfall fare best among the courtiers, but Abbie Cornish makes little impression, Rhys Ifans just seems to be going through the motions and Samantha Morton is fairly awful as Mary. Both bland and risibly hammy at the same time, with her risibly overemphatic delivery she feels like a smug prefect in a school play playing up to the gallery rather than a credible conspiring monarch, giving easily the worst performance in the film even after the worst of her performance hit the cutting room floor. Yet the biggest surprise in the film is Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh.

If at first it seems disastrous casting the zombie-like Owen as the representation of the life and love Elizabeth can never have, but, amazingly, for once he almost rises to the occasion. Like many a bad actor he's utterly hopeless in the moments that aren't about him, looking bored when he's supposed to be listening, displaying complete disinterest in his scenes with Abbie Cornish and sleepwalking through the battle with the Armada, but for once he handles his monologues - the best writing in the film - surprisingly well, even changing his expression a few times, though quite why he chooses to play his early scenes with a bad American accent remains a mystery. It's not a perfect performance (the deleted scenes on the DVD show that his flat delivery and lack of timing botched a gift of a scene with Rush), but for the first time there are signs that if he was willing to really put in the work and had a director who wouldn't mistake talking in a bored Coventry accent for a performance he could be a capable jobbing supporting actor.

The 1.85:1 widescreen transfer is a bit disappointingly short on detail in some scenes, though there are a decent set of extras.",1241827200,,3806,4.797256097560975
3278736,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Picking up shortly after Elizabeth I left off the movie portrays the complicated life of one of England's greatest Monarchs. Elizabeth The Golden Age, shows us the balance which was required of Elizabeth, balancing the incredible tenacity and guts it took to rule England and her fears and longings for real love and security.

  Elizabeth's life is a story of overcoming the odds. Born second child of Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn, she was supposed the be the long awaited and promised son of the King, yet Henry's wishes for a son were dashed upon her birth. In the first movie we see the growth of her strength which Elizabeth must muster to survive, and in The Golden Age we see the strength come into full bloom, the strength she will need to overcome the looming Spanish evasion and the always present question of marriage and producing a male heir.

  Europe has become divided by Protestant and Catholic, and Elizabeth's own country and family has fallen along divided lines as well. Queen Mary of Scotland sits to the north imprisoned by Elizabeth, but Mary possesses something that Elizabeth does not have, the backing of Catholic Spain and France. For Elizabeth it is only a matter of time until she will be called upon to do something about the looming threat of Mary. When that time comes we find Elizabeth torn between what must be done to a trader and the rights of a sovereign Queen like herself.

  It is this decision which leads to the climax of the movie. Mary is favored by Spain and with the outcome of Mary's fate, Spain steps into action to crush the Protestant [...] Elizabeth. Elizabeth faced with an impeding invasion of the Spanish steps forward to encourage her  countrymen in the battle and protect her beloved England.

  However The Golden Age is not solely about the battles between countries but the battles of the heart. Elizabeth although known as the Virgin Queen is not without the need of love and passion. Yet Elizabeth knows that this could pose as big a threat to her and her country as the Spanish and French.

This film is truly a feast for the eyes - incredible costumes and sets are only the beginning. I would recommend that one watch The Golden Age after first viewing Elizabeth I. It will assist in knowing where Elizabeth has been and the amount of growth in Elizabeth is amazing to watch.",1240272000,,2353,4.6521739130434785
3278737,4,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth,"" the first film, was about a young woman coming to the throne in a period of great turmoil, and how she dealt with that... It was love in the context of power, betrayal, and survival...

In ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" we're dealing with the most famous aspects of her regime, the Spanish Armada, the Babington Plot, which was a major plot against her, and Walter Raleigh bringing back the very early understanding of the New World, and the horizons beyond Britain... It is the exploration of unrestricted power...

Elizabeth, as cultured and as intelligent and eloquent as she was, had never left the shores of England... And into her court, strides an explorer who has literally been where the maps end... The gallant Raleigh (Clive Owen) was a free spirit who thrills the queen with his tales and discoveries at sea ... The classic 16th-century adventurer who doesn't play by any official rules, and he does bring into the world of the court something very alluring, enigmatic and charismatic, which has a big impact on the queen...

The relationship between Raleigh and Elizabeth was very complicated... There were things holding Elizabeth back... ""We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love."" These words were spoken by Sir Walter Raleigh to the Virgin Quenn...It's very rare that the Queen takes interest in a man, and she does...

At this special point, England was very weak militarily... Elizabeth had discharged the navy... And once again it was the old problem of religious instability, which harasses the human race frequently...

Anybody that's interested in this period of history will find it fascinating just how capable Elizabeth was in regards to how she dealt with the captive Queen of Scots...

Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) had great respect for the Protestant Elizabeth, and was remarkably intrigued by her, and desperate to meet her, and fascinated... For several years Elizabeth suffered about her execution because she really believed two things... She believed that any queen was divine... She accepted as true that her Catholic cousin was there by the will of God, and therefore, Mary was there by the will of God... And in executing Mary, she would disintegrate her one belief that she herself was divine...

Mary found it in death... Elizabeth had to find it in life... So if you look at the Armada, Elizabeth finally does become divine, and that's why we had to admire how the scene of the Armada is shot, by Shekhar Kapur, in that way... It's not actually a fiery sea battle between two countries... It's a 'Holy War' with Spain... Therefore, the defining moments of the Armada is when Elizabeth walks up across the verdant cliffs in flowing white nightgown... She's no longer the Avenging Queen... She's instead a supernatural being, a disembodied soul defeating the enemy, dominating the fearless of the waves, the force of the storm, and the strength of fire...

Dripping with intrigues, plots, battles, mysteries, and strong emotions, the film captured the ecclesiastical spaces of the cathedrals to look more like a palace environment... It also captured the feel of the16th century architecture, linking and matching it to the proper locations...",1237075200,,3271,5.0

3278740,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Shekhar Kapur picks where he left off in telling  the story of Elizabeth Tudor in 1998 by presenting his interpretation of the latter half of the Great Gloriana's reign in this 2007 sequel.
  It begins in 1585. Elizabeth has been England's ruler for over a quarter century, and is now 52.
 She deals with threats of  invasion by Spanish King Phillip II(Jordi Molla), her ex-half-brother-in-law, and plots  against her that are a little closer to home by Scottish Queen Mary Stuart(Samantha Morton), her Catholic cousin, whose legitimate claim to the English throne is supported by Spain and Rome, but who arguably overplays her hand in dealing with her cousin.
 Meeting with her council members, her chief advisor Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush)advises her to monitor England's Catholic population more closely. While omitting her famous line, ""I will not make a window on men's and women's souls"", the Queen's(onscreen) actions reveal this. She vows to punish her people only based only on their deeds, not their beliefs (which in reality, didn't happen).
 The story omits  the Queen's most trusted advisor, William Cecil, as well as Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Cecil, and Robert Devereaux, and focuses on her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh (the ruggedly handsome Clive Owen, with radiant charisma, but looking as though he stepped from the canvas of an oil painting), who has just returned from the New World, having named the colony of Virginia in honor of the Virgin Queen, with the bounty of the New World, a few Native Americans, and pirated treasure from Spanish ships in tow.
 One has to overlook many historical inaccuracies to enjoy the performances of the beautifully intelligent Abbie Cornish as the Queen's ward, and most-favored lady-in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, Christian Brassington as the Archduke of Austria ( whose appearance recounts an episode of the storied Queen's life that took place earlier than the 1580s), David Threfall as Royal Astrologer, John Dee, whose prediction  of a war between two Empires, and vaguary surrounding those details troubles Elizabeth, Eddie Redmayne, as Anthony Babington, the Jesuit's recruit to assassinate the English Queen, Rhys Ifans as co-conspirator and envoy to Spain, Robert Reston, and Adam Godley as Francis Walsingham's traitorous brother, William.
 We are led through sundry intrigues, and court rituals, as well as the Queen's dramatic response to a threat by a Spanish Ambassador in which she claims to have  an internal ""hurricane that can strip Spain bare"", before we come to the high drama surrounding the trial and execution of Mary Stuart, an incident which causes Elizabeth much distress and may well have made her re-live the similar scenario involving her own mother, although she may have been too young to remember the latter. Tom Hollander's Sir Amyas Paulet, presides over the Scottish Queen's demise.
  Under the observant eye of his  daughter, the Infanta Isabel (who was actually 21 in 1588, but here is portrayed by child actress Aimee King, decked out like a 16th century Wednesday Addams),a vengeful King Phillip, who supported Mary Stuart, declares Holy War on England. Elizabeth has to forgive Raleigh's seduction of Bess to appoint him as captain of her naval forces.
 The climax of the film is the dramatic confrontation of the Spanish Armada, where Henry VIII's once unwelcome daughter presides over an astonishing victory. The cinematography of this scene is particularly bold.
 Dealing with life and death matters among her closest subjects shortly thereafter, she settles into her role as mother of her people, and helps England close the 16th century on a golden note.
 The acting and the costumes are superb, and I have often felt the best historical dramas are ones that resemble moving oil paintings of the time they depict on canvas. Director Kapur succeeds in creating that effect here.",1234051200,,3893,5.1900958466453675

3278743,3,B000ZOXDG4,"This is indeed a very colorful production and the acting is all pretty good, especially Kate Blanchette.
However it has two main problems
-- First there is the mis-blending of plots and episodes in the movie: Elizabeth's affairs at court with Sir Walter Raleigh shares about the same screen time as does the war with the spanish. But neither get dealt with properly or fully - they get dabbled in ... pity.
I am not sure how accurate the movie is. I honestly don't know but as a general history lesson it brings up interesting stuff about the religious background to spain etc. If it is correct in it's depictions then as a believer in secularism I am glad the spanish armada did not succeed againt England. The church has a lot to answer for in history no doubt. I say that tough I now live in Spain myself and love it to bits.
-- The second problem is the presence of Hollywood - the over-iconiation of Elizabeth is a pain amidst all the continuous background synthesized wall-to-wall dribble music. When will these producers ever learn? With all the classical music available not to mention endless abstract pieces that could have been used, I cannot understand the dullness of mind which the director is guilty of here. This is why this movie will always be a ""B"" flick. What a pity! A bit of simple taste and it might have been a classic. Certainly the stunning visual settings and costumes were all up to it.
I wish Hollywood would learn. Maybe take a page from A Man for all Seasons - pace things on the screen a little bit more rather than bombarding the viewer with this overproduction. Modern technology is great but we need to know when not to apply it.
Especially having spend all the time and money.
Let me give one small example of what I mean: There is a scene at a late stage of the file where the camera rotates a few times round a beautifully crafted doll/statuette of the queen(Kate Blanchette). Really marvelous idea but not at this stage of the story and for so long with all the meaningless background music raging. The film at this stage was boring and the scene served only to irritate this viewer - I just wanted it to end. Why not have this maybe in the opening scene and without the sound assault?!

It's tough to beat a foursome like Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen and Samantha Morton for good acting but - for me,  the star of the film was the photographer. In this case it is Remi Adefarasin. Between his camera-work, the direction of Shekhar Kapur, and the production design by Guy Dyas, this film is a series of pure visual treats.

I'm not one who usually pays much attention to costuming but Queen Elizabeth's attire in this movie is spectacular. A nod to the great costume design efforts of Alexandra Byrne.

Some people complain Elizabeth isn't portrayed as a strong-enough woman in this movie. I'll use a British response for that: ""rubbish."" Not only is she strong, she is shown as human - not some cold-blooded machine, but as someone with feelings like the rest of us. All her emotions - and I mean all - are on display along with inspiring leadership of her country, with the latter's welfare her number one priority.",1227657600,,1145,4.826530612244898
3278749,4,B000ZOXDG4,"In this sequel to Shekhar Kapur's 1998 Elizabeth, The Golden Age addresses Elizabeth's status in 1585, faced with war with Spain and the fate of her cousin, Mary Stuart, ousted from the Scottish throne and seeking Elizabeth's aid in reclaiming her rightful place. While plotting treachery against England, Stuart (Samantha Morton) enjoys the freedom to send secret missives to Spain. And Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla) schemes to deliver the rigors of the Inquisition to England and banish Elizabeth (Kate Blanchett). On a more personal level, Elizabeth is enchanted by an adventurous Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), recently returned from the New World and bursting with ideas for England's expansion across the sea. Unwilling to release the charming Raleigh for a return voyage, Elizabeth increasingly depends upon him to fill the lonely hours of what is a very solitary reign. The ageing Francis Wallsingham (beautifully understated by the always precise Geoffrey Rush) stands guard at the queen's side, delivering the news she is reluctant to entertain, his conscientiousness grown tiresome, but increasingly necessary over the years.

As events unfold, Elizabeth will face two momentous decisions: how to dispose of her blood relative and fellow-queen, Mary Stuart; and how to successfully engage in war with Spain, Philip's armada soon to arrive off the coast of England, far superior to England's maritime efforts. More painful, personally, is Raleigh's betrayal- Elizabeth's handmaiden, Bess, is carrying his child, yet another bitter pill for this beleaguered queen to swallow on her solitary sojourn as queen of England. Despite Blanchett's perfect beauty in this role and her adaptation of a more mature, yet still deeply emotional monarch, the true star of the film is the extravagant cinematography. The plot line is less than stirring, yet I find it impossible to grade this film with less than four stars for its arresting images. Scene after scene captures the essence of an era, perfectly rendered, historically accurate details: Philip stalking through his palace, black-cloaked and followed by chanting monks, the air suffused with light and grace; Elizabeth, alone in her rooms, the castle huge and hollow without the comfort of one who loves more than serves her.

On the precipice of the battle, Elizabeth emerges to rally her troops, the daunting Spanish armada visible off the coast. She is magnificent in silver armor on a white horse, long red tresses streaming down her back, an iconic Joan d' Arc to spur the men to victory in the face of a superior force. While Raleigh directs the English ships, the battle is engaged, the sea eventually filled with the bodies of the vanquished, Spanish Inquisitors, men of God, horses plunging over the sides of ships, weighty crucifixes tumbling into the deep while Elizabeth and Wallsingham rejoice. Silent much of the time, Blanchett rules this role through the force of her personality, leaving no doubt about the queen's terrible choices and brilliant monarchy. Still as a statue, she stands, hands raised to her people, a vision in white, lonely yet unforgettable. I can still see the striking images in this film, a testament to art and cinematography.

I can't believe Elizabeth:The Golden Age did not win best picture. The logistics of the movie must have been a nightmare what with the sets, costumes, wigs, makeup, cinematography,production design,etc.

I like this director's work. He uses the ""God view"" camera-work, we see the characters by hovering over their heads in many shots. I didn't find this distracting, quite the contrary, it was hypnotic, as was the ""artsy"" lighting and camera of whizzing around a holy looking Elizabeth.

I don't know if anyone noticed the possibility that Elizabeth was a lesbian or bi-sexual. She seemed to have a very close relationship with the stunningly gorgeous Bess played by Abbie Cornish whom I'd never seen before. I'm straight, but, omigod, if a pale yellow perfect rosebud could be transformed into a human face, it would be hers! Her face is so beautiful pure and innocent, she'll make you weep. Elizabeth seemed sexually torn between Beth and Raleigh which made it pretty interesting.

The costumes, wigs, makeup, sets, cinematography, and especially the bold music score was a feast! It makes me sick that No Country For Old Men beat this one out at the Oscars! I have a feeling that there's a trilogy here, but if this one did not make a profit, I doubt if we'll get to see how it all turned out. Cate Blanchett OWNS this character!!!

The point was HER - attention focused on her. That's what she expected and craved - demanded.

The movie may not be dynamic - but folks, that's the way life was during that time. (At least this is more believable than the tragic ""Tudor"" series!)

As in the earlier film, also directed by Shekhar Kapur, this picture is filled with of court intrigues, plus a plot by the Spanish Government and Mary Stuart to assassinate the Queen, all of which culminates with a huge sea battle and the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called ""The Virgin Queen"" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.

Elizabeth I, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, is more moderate than her father. The movie continues to create great suspense as we learn more about the latter years of her reign. Her loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, continues to help the monarch to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and Elizabeth is able to check mate all attempts against her.

The extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur added amazing detail to provide authenticity as to the battle between England and Spain, and they build a ship that is half Armada, half British, then PC replicated, providing awesome battle scenes. The architecture and decorations of the time are exquisite, filming where construction is actually taking place, and dressing in period clothing all construction workers, so the reality is magnificent.

In this film we see a monarch that is now experienced but confronting great challenges because her Catholic cousin, Mary Stuart is after her throne and upon her death, Spain sees the opportunity to attack England under the disguise that she has executed an anointed queen. We see the relationship the queen has with Sir Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen, who brings unique gifts from the new discovered lands of Virginia, named in honor of the Queen. His masterful knowledge of the seas provides great insight to Elizabeth during the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

Compare Elizabeth's way too Henryesque battle speech with Will's to see how flaccid this is. Not even poetry with a lower case p.

Too many stories going on simultaneously, each of them plenty sufficient to drive the plot, means that the whole thing becomes a confused and wild mess. But the shame comes in the lost opportunities. The execution of Mary, one of the most bizarre and terrifying events in English history, is really untouched. (Maybe they wanted to keep the Elizabeth as guilty and torn and the Elizabeth unsullied by this.) But for a graphic and visually compelling film such as this, the site of her head dropping from the exectioner's hand would have been rather startling.

And the love stuff, while maybe historically accurate (Raleigh did enjoy the queen's favor to a remarkable degree) just sunk this tale. We know she doesn't get the man, we also know she doesn't seem to want to. Showing her as an emotional and flighty female, while more in line with current sensibilities, just doesn't seem authentic.

The story is oddly vacant and not really accurate, but the visuals are stunning, and you can't help but enjoy the purity of Blanchett's performance.

I rather fear that too many people will take this ""MTV"" account of Elizabeth's life seriously, and that's a shame. It's a bit like reading the Spark Notes to the Golden Age of England, or watching the Mel Gibson version of ""Hamlet."" It's not BAD, but lord knows it's not accurate or deep. You're there for Mel in tights.

The same applies to Clive Owen. Edgy and divinely roguish in his role as Sir Walter Raleigh, he was certainly an eyeful of man candy. Again, his life was not entirely ACCURATE, but in a production such as this, I suppose that's neither here nor there: we are watching for ENTERTAINMENT.

If I really wanted ACCURACY, I'd watch the History Channel.

The costumes were beautifully done; the landscapes were gorgeous. Again, Blanchett MADE the movie worthy of attention, along with the cinematography and rich colors from artful contrasts and allusions.

I can't stop praising Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth. It is rich and complex, highlighting the solitude of a woman in power and trying to maintain her own against a male-dominated society and Houses. A society where her virginity is her biggest gambling chip against other countries. It was simply a brilliant portrayal!

I enjoyed this movie for what it was: ""BASED"" on the life of Elizabeth I. As we all know, that gives them license to ""elaborate."" (Although, they just... well... snipped the tip of that time period.)

3278778,5,B000ZOXDG4,"There have been so many versions of Queen Elizabeth's life, but I believe this one will stand out. I loved Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh, and of course Cate was superb. A young queen is torn between her country and allowing herself to fall in love or be loved.  Focusing on her country at a time when her throne and people need her undivided attention is an intense, bittersweet glance into another Era.  When Elizabeth is tricked into allowing her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scotland, to be sentenced to death and beheaded, Elizabeth's spirit and ability to face and fight the mighty Armada of Spain are fully tested.

3278779,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I adored the first Elizabeth. It was perfect in it's script and flawless in it's acting. After watching The Golden Age however, I was utterly distraught. I cannot believe that this is made by the same man who directed the first film. It just doesn't seem possible.
Everything from the script, to the editing to the actors that don't belong, it just doesn't work or flow. If there is one redeaming aspect of this film, it is the once again brilliant performance by Cate Blanchette. She can do no wrong. She is one of the most skilled actresses out there, anywhere. However, my gripe is actually with her character. She doesn't even seem to be the same Queen from the first Elizabeth. Granted, years have passed, but this Elizabeth comes off as weak and undecided, jittery even. It doesn't feel right. Abbie Cornish also feels very wrong as the Queen's favorite lady-in-waiting. She is very out of place, no matter the beautiful costume she is wearing.

Samantha Morton as Mary Stewart is UTTERLY wasted. They could have just cast some unknown, so small and barely noticable a part she played. One of my favorite actors, Geoffry Rush was shamefully placed in the background and barely had anything to do with this film. His character was a favorite of mine in the first film.
Clive Owen is pointless in this. His character feels neither here nor there. Wrong choice in actors, I guess.

The plot was also confusing, it jumped around way too much and you never really know how much time has passed. There is no mystery or intrigue. Nothing to captivate. The final and supposedly huge battle is a few boring minutes long and feels almost out of place.

The costumes and wigs are magnificent, as in the first film.  Again, one of the only bright spots.

This is an extrememly dissapointing film that probably should not have been made. It seems very unnecessary. This is definitely one of the instances where a sequel is so much worse than the original.",1213920000,,1948,4.684210526315789
3278780,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Okay, so I'm a little impartial; I'm a huge Cate Blanchett fan and also love historical movies. That being said I think this is a great movie, and even better than the first. There has been a lot of criticism that the film is not historically accurate, and while that may be true, it is called historical fiction for a reason; if you're looking for a documentary on Elizabeth I, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth-The-Acclaimed-Saga-of-England-s-Virgin-Queen/dp/B000065Q9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth: The Acclaimed Saga of England's Virgin Queen</a>&nbsp;produced by the History Channel. Some people have said this movie is only good for eye candy and that the plot is incidental and weak, that it isn't complex or motivate the viewer to think. While I don't necessarily disagree with this opinion, I would argue that there are at least two types of cinematic styles that can make a film extraordinary. The first is the intellectual type that requires abstract thinking, attention to detail and a good memory, the type of film that when all the pieces fall into place it seems almost like an epiphany. The second type of extraordinary film is one that is poignant, sensuous, ecstatogenic and fills one with exaltation. Elizabeth - The Golden Age is the latter type of film. It truly is sublime in the Romantic sense; attempting to analyze, interpret, and dissect this film will all cause you to miss the point! One can only appreciate the sublime when one ceases to try to comprehend, label, and order it; you can only stand in awe of it and allow it to overwhelm you. This is not to say that one type of film is better than the other, simply that they cannot be appreciated in the same manner. Think of the joy the first time you solved a complex equation or suddenly grasped a complex scientific theory; this is analogous to appreciation of a highly complex detail oriented film. Now think of the first time you heard Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy""; you certainly wouldn't have been able to appreciate it if you had approached it in the same analytical fashion as say, the Golden Ratio. So, try to approach this film on its own terms, and you won't be disappointed.",1213747200,,2239,5.054054054054054
3278781,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Long anticipated part three of the Queeen Elizabeth trilogy is finally out there with beautiful Kate Blanchett in the lead role.  Film focuses on the time in British history when Spain, the most powerful country in Europe, attempts to invade Britain in the name of the Catholic faith.  The premise film makes is that Spanish are using Mary, Queen of Scotland, as a bait for Elizabeth to give Spain a reason for invasion.  Important favorite at that time of Elizabeth's reign is Sir Walter Raleigh, who ends up marrying her favorite lady-in-waiting Bess.  Film attempts to cover many aspects of that time: clash between catholic and protestant faith, conflict between liberty and inquisition, Elizabeth's internal struggle between her duty as a queen to her country and her own need for love and loyalty of the man. One constant about all films about this fascinating queen is that she was strong, wise and dedicated ot her service toher people.  Her sense of duty and leadership overrode principal requirement of the time - to marry another prince and create political alliance with another strong European royal powerhouse.  She has managed to deliver prosperity to England and help protestanism establish its roots there.  She has redefined history as a woman, ruler and a political figure of her time who was able to control church, her court and her royal subjects with her wit alone.  However, the full acting credit in this film should go to Samantha Morton in her role of Queen Mary.

3278784,4,B000ZOXDG4,"to me, cate blanchett is one of ten english-speaking actresses that could croak the abcs and i would buy a ticket for it. so, i didn't find my way to 'elizabeth: the golden age' for a history lesson.  likewise, i'm not an anglophile and have some feeling that the english have done some really funky things in the name of their queen.  but that aside, i have nothing but admiration for blanchett's second take on the virgin queen under kapur's fanciful direction.

blanchett and kapur made their chapters in the queen's life a romantic, lush film with hints of political intrigue accompanied by stunning visual and design effects (the watching eyes of the ladies in waiting as elizabeth and sir dudley make love turning in to prints of eyes on her drapes is still so wist ful and enchanting).  kapur was also able to give screen time to more than a few actors like daniel craig.  craig is now the british flavor du jour.  not to mention kelly macdonald and emily mortimer as two of elizabeth's ladies in waiting and the wonderful kathy burke as queen mary.

now the visuals are just as stunning--and from what i gather as anachronistic--as before.  alexandra byrne's costumes are even more sumptuous than before and very worthy of their academy award.  and geoffrey rush is on hand again as elizabeth's advisor and he is even more authoritative.

and as for cate--she is just as magnificent as she was before.  now she is power incarnate as she presses through the cavernous sets in her array of silks and brocades.  and she has more than a few moments of vulnerability as she watches her favorite lady bess dance with her favorite lord, sir walter raleigh and relives when she was younger.  her last night talks with her lady bess are also warm and filled with many depths.

now i wish that the score could have been a little more right and less a wash of strings and whatnot that make up the standard historical epic score.  and even though it may or may not be a huge part of british history, i would like to have seen more of samantha morton.  after all, she is a very good actor and mary, queen of scots is a very good role.

it would have been too much to expect blanchett to take many (if any) awards for this performance but the work still stands strong--even if it's not buoyed up by statuettes.",1211587200,,2304,4.526570048309178

First we are treated to Elizabeth's problems with Mary Stuart, then her relationshop with Walter Raleigh (an excellent Clive Owen) and then the struggle with Prince Phillip of Spain to maintain diplomacy which culminates in war. In comparison to the original, there was a distinct point of view but in this sequel, everything is scattered with a lack of focus. The 3 stars I give this to are the superb HD DVD transfer, Blanchette's performance and of course the battle scenes.  This is disc you would need to show off the virtues of HI-DEF!!

3278788,3,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is a continuation of the life and loves of Queen Elizabeth I of England as portrayed by Cate Blanchett and directed by Shekhar Kapur. The first ""Elizabeth"" was a perfectly watchable costume drama, but never quite made it to excellence. The sequel leaves more to be desired.

Familiar themes from the first movie remain a source of contention for Elizabeth. Religious strife threatens to rip the country in half and Europe teeters on war. Elizabeth, despite the advice of spymaster Sir Walshingham (once again played by the great Geoffrey Rush) takes a restrained approach to dealing with the English Catholics. Less restrained is she in the affairs of the heart when the dashing Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) returns from plundering the Spanish. Plunder is a dish best served with potatoes. (Just watch it ...)

Of course, when devout religious believers, politics, and a megalomaniac monarch meet, things get a little dicey. King Philip of Spain, under the pretext of avenging the execution of Mary Stuart (history is a little distorted here) launches his massive Armada to England, but is defeated by a storm.

The film lacks the emotional depth and lacks pathos for the character. Also, the defeat of the Armada completely lacks any sense of urgency or desperation that the English must have felt.

The film deals with the Virgin Queen's relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh, while King Philip II of Spain amasses a massive armada to destroy Elizabeth, and replace her on the throne with Mary, Queen of Scots.
While the film does take dramatic license with historical events, it is a moving, powerful portrayal of the life and times of Elizabeth I. Blanchett is once again fantastic as Elizabeth, while Clive Owen is great as Raleigh. Samantha Morton (Mary), Geoffrey Rush (Walsingham) and Jordi Moll (Philip II) give strong supporting performances. While the story itself is a bit slow during the first half, it picks up in the second half, with fantastic visual effects and action creating a powerful reenactment of the fight with the Spanish Armada off the British Coast.
If you enjoyed the original ""Elizabeth,"" then you will find equal enjoyment out of ""The Golden Age."" But if you haven't seen the first film, you'll be sure to enjoy this film all the same.

3278798,3,B000ZOXDG4,"Elizabeth I is considered by many to be among the most significant and fascinating monarchs to ever walk the earth.  She is also regarded as among the most beloved as well.  To create a lush and dramatic series of films about her long and storied rule is by no means unexpected, nor is it very original as the amount of on-screen interpretations of Elizabeth directly reflects the fascination we have in pondering the meaning of her reign.  Elizabeth:  The Golden Age is Shekhar Kapur's sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth/dp/B000RF7XYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth</a>, a film that introduced us to the famous queen and showed us the first part of her reign.  It's funny, I've been watching Showtime's the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors/dp/B000XV6VOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors</a>&nbsp;and the most recent episodes have shown us Elizabeth's birth and even a little bit about Mary I, the queen that proceeded her and the daughter of Catherine of Aragon .  Given the nature of the hedonistic protagonists Anne Bolyn and King Henry VIII on that show and its positive portrayal of victimized Catholics such as Saint Thomas More, it was quite refreshing to see the Catholic Church in the interrogation room once again, perhaps where it belongs.  Anyway, the significance in the quasi-history portrayed on both this film and that show compliment each other quite nicely as Spain during the second half of Elizabeth's rule was an absolute god-fearing behemoth and a force to be reckoned with.  Some people have said this film is Anti-Catholic but really, these are the days of the inquisition we're watching.  It might be a task to stay balanced.

Elizabeth is fundamentally very easy to sympathize with, after all it isn't really her fault her father was a pervert and her mother his mistress.  Nevertheless, Cate Blanchett has so much range that her performance quietly shows us her less obvious flaws.  I'm convinced that no other actress could portray this queen in a way that justifies her reputation.  The cast is actually great even beyond her though, which is not unlike the first film.  Walter Raleigh is played by Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush is Francis Walsingham and Mary, Queen of Scots is played with great villainy by Samantha Morton.  The film follows the Battle of Gravelines in the Anglo-Spanish War as it's primary battle scene but most of the film is focused on the amazing costumes, music, and sets.  It also ponders Elizabeth's interpersonal relationships.

There are massive historical inaccuracies that are for the most part done to heighten drama but some are pretty inexplicable (where the hell was Robert Cecil?).  I guess the inaccuracies would be inconsequential if I didn't also believe that 99% of the audience would see The Golden Age as their only reference to the virgin queen.  I'm not so sure I can forgive that but I know many viewers will.  Elizabeth's famous speech to the troops at Tilbury before the invasion of the Spanish Armada is widely documented but for those who don't know it is regarded as fact, the scene comes off as derivative of just about every Hollywood epic period film made in the last twenty years.  Blanchett is not at fault but her plate armor and lack of femininity in the way the scene is directed actually brought back the long forgotten memories of Milla Jovovich's speech as Joan of Arc in the pathetically amateur Luc Besson film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Messenger-The-Story-of-Joan-of-Arc/dp/0767845722/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc</a>.  That isn't to say The Golden Age is as bad a film, it is not.  It captures the magic expected of a portrayal of this leader in flashes but misses the opportunity to capture her most significant speech.  They actually blew it.

Anyway, very good looking film with some really great acting, but take heed; the history buffs might take issue with the accuracy, while the movie buffs might mistakenly walk out thinking they've learned something.  I'd like to consider myself a little bit of both so consider this a mixed review leaning toward a partial recommendation for the visuals and performances.",1208131200,,4320,5.400894187779434

In walks the adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh, which does turn Elizabeth's head.  He wants to continue exploring the new world, but needs the Queen's sponsorship.  Unfortunately, her romantic dreams of him don't quite work out.  But she does get Virginia named after her.

Many movies have shown bits and pieces of Elizabeth before with Betty Davis being one of the best, but this rivals even her magnificent classic version.  I highly recommend you catch this visual treat with substance. The movie centers on Protestant Elizabeth dealing with the Catholic King Philip II of Spain. His Inquisition is sweeping Europe and threatens the freedoms of all, including the English. Spain plots war with the assistance of the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots. Some magnifcent scenes including the battle in the English Channel with the Spanish Armada make it a feast for the eyes.

Cate Blanchett brings off the disjunctions masterfully and with amazing imagination.  Geoffrey Rush is subtle and surprizing.  Elizabeth and Walsingham, Walter Raleigh and Henry IV of Spain!--there are few more fascinating characters.

I could find nothing wrong with the story.  I did a little research after watching and found that it is pretty close to truth.  Elizabeth did, for example, send Raleigh to the tower out of jealousy.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada had a lot to do with the inexperience of the Spanish command, but then, it was miraculous too.  I enjoy the ideas at play, the tensions between renown and isolation, authority and individuality, reason and coercion, between open and closed societies.  This is a script with some substance.

It is a dramatized episodic biography.  It is similar in form to movies like ""Ghandi"" and ""Laurence of Arabia"".  This series has similar appropriate sorts of pay off.

3278806,5,B000ZOXDG4,"First the table is set for us. England is in trouble. Spain rules supreme with a vastly superior navy, The Spanish Armada. Phillip of Spain in a fanatical despot. A Catholic obcessed with destroying Elizabeth, the ""bastard queen"" who is by the way, Protestant. That alone didn't set her apart. It was her williness to allow her subjects to worship as they wished, a very radical notion at the time. By 1585, Elizabeth is middle-aged & probably not going to marry or have an heir. But she is still a woman & Sir Walter Raleigh comes into her life. He is a privateer, an adventerer, good-looking & cool as hell. He entertains her with stories of the new world which he has visited, claimed & named for her... Virginia. She falls for him & commands he stay. He tires of court life & desires to return to sea. Eventually, he takes up with Elizabeth's favorite Lady-in-waiting, Bess. Sir Walter impregnates & marries her, in that order, apparently. This of course enrages the Queen. Soon however there are more important things to deal with. She had been forced by her advisors to execute her cousin(?) Mary, Queen of Scots,  a Catholic claiming she is the rightful queen. The Spanish Armada is coming with troops to invade England. Elizabeth, looking very butch in her armour,
addreses her troops who are to defend England. But they don't have to.
Shortly, a storm intervenes, destroying the Armada & Phillip's dreams.
  The tone of this movie was somewhat lighter than the first. Just the ligther colors & sprit conveyed the idea that Elizabeth had coosolidated her power, which was absolute. Perhaps the best years of her reign. If you like history, you'll  appreciate this effort. However accurate it is much of it is historical fact. Considering we are looking back over 400 years it is really excellent. Forget that it is history, if you must. It is still a pretty good story.",1206489600,,1877,4.730886850152905

The Golden Age is poorly written, badly acted and predictable. It does not deserve to be equated to March or Die.  It is as inane as Ishtar. Blanchett, Rush, etc. play the same predictable roles as in any piece of this genre. It is hackneyed and trite.

However, Cate Blanchet continues to embody the powerful part of Queen Elizabeth I.  The movie ran on with scenes that had no build up of how they came to be.

3278816,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate Blanchett is spectacular as Queen Elizabeth I.  The film is loaded with style, story, history and a magnificent splendor not seen of late.
Admittedly, it is a triffle difficult task to create a film that is altogether historic, accurate, precise in detail and entertaining for those who don't appreciate the history and accuracy and detail.  Some detail must be left on the cutting room floor and a broad brush must therefore paint the intricate picture of who's who and whyfore.  But this film is balanced in this regard, almost perfectly balanced in this regard.
It is an art film to be sure, and a beautiful masterful art film at that.  Geoffrey Rush as the senior advisor and confident of the queen, is reprised in the role of Francis Wallsingham, the eyes and ears of all things secret.  Clive Owen is very good as Walter Raleigh, perhaps a bit much of a romantic than historical, but placed well within the story line and effective as an element of cohesion between the plots and the actual events.  Cate Blanchett is the greatest actress since Bette Davis and a true 'star' of the screen.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth is breathless perfection.  One is immediately endeared to the queen in both as a part of history and as a deep person of greatest inner strength and womanhood.  (Bette Davis and Cate Blanchett played the same role, years apart, and both are supreme.)

The digital effects are necessary and beautifully accomplished, yet not overdone as in most epic films.  The scene near the end where Elizabeth is standing upon a rock at the sea's edge watching the destruction of the Armada ranks with the best in any film of any time.

I would love to see a third film someday about the reign of the queen in later years with Cate Blanchett in the role.  I would never tire of seeing her.

Excellent, supreme masterpiece this is that the entire family could enjoy.  Any violence is non-gratuitous and germaine to the story.  It is a clean film by today's standards.  It is a love story yes, but more of a story of courage and determination to overcome fear and prevail in the face of what could have been certain destruction for England.",1205366400,,2153,4.6534391534391535
3278817,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I loved the first movie, Elizabeth.  The Golden Age, however, does not live up to my hopes of a solid sequel.  Though it shares the same general look as its predacessor and some continuity of the characters and their personal story lines, it is much less polished.  Though the love Elizabeth had for Bess was evident, I did not feel any believable chemistry between Elizabeth and Walter.  Cate Blanchett is a great actress but I felt the movie was cut in such a way that the queen appears to be a flurry of emotion shifting in every which direction and hardly having the time for it to soak-in between frames. The scenes needed to be longer or else more cleverly melded together to build the appropriate tension and further develop the characters.  The gory scenes only appeared to add to the problem of time - taking precious minutes away from what would have drawn me more into the plot.  It was frustrating to watch this movie after the masterpiece that came before it.",1205193600,,972,4.589595375722543

Cate and Clive both look marvelous, simply marvelous. Cate certainly belts her lines out with conviction and Clive does a very reasonable Errol Flynn. But there's no center to this film, no evidence that any thought went into it at all. To borrow a bit more from the Bard himself, while there's lots of sound and fury, it signifies nothing.",1205193600,,479,4.783132530120482
3278819,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I wonder: why do filmmakers bother to tackle an historical subject, if they are intent on changing so much of the facts that the result bears only a vague resemblance to what actually happened? What's the point? Why not simply revert to fantasy altogether? In this film about Queen Elizabeth I's ""golden age"", the time around the Armada attack of 1588, maybe the most surprising thing is the choice of protagonists. One gets the impression Francis Walsingham and Walter Raleigh were the two dominant forces in the Queen's life, which in fact they weren't by a long shot. Her most influential advisor and mentor, William Cecil, doesn't even appear on the cast list, and nor do the Earls of Leicester and Essex, who both ranked much higher on her list of favourites than Raleigh ever did. The latter character is turned into a swashbuckling hero, while in real life he was a vain and arrogant coxcomb, who wouldn't have dreamed to show himself in the slightly shabby, unvaried costume Clive Owen has to make do with - on the contrary, he loved expensive clothes and jewelry. He was also deeply unpopular at court.

The Raleigh in this film is actually a conflation of Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake. It was the latter who brought the potatoe to England and who spent a great deal of time at sea. It was Drake, too, who vanquished the Armada, and though that is in the film, the notion of Raleigh being aboard and Drake seeking his advice is patently absurd. As is the idea of Elizabeth watching the burning ships from Tilbury, for the fleet engaged in battle in front of the French coast, not the English. Nor would she have seen so much flame: the fire ships scared off and dispersed the Spanish, but only one of their ships was actually burnt. And as for Tilbury: why do we get such a botched version of Elizabeth's celebrated speech? Even its most famous line (""I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman..."") is not in the film.

Fortunately, the dealings with Mary, Queen of Scots are depicted somewhat more accurately, that is, if we forget that Mary would have had a French, not a Scottish accent and that Fotheringay wasn't set in majestic highland scenery but in the Northamptonshire flatlands. We get a good sense of the devious, scheming man Walsingham was - the J. Edgar Hoover of his day. Of course, Mary's exact role in the plot has never been established beyond doubt the way it seems here, but the interpretation is defensible. However, Walsingham's brother William, supposedly embroiled in the catholic plot, is entirely fictional: Francis was an only son. It's a far-fetched invention to add some psychological drama to Walsingham's character, something that might have been better achieved through a decent script. The scene where Elizabeth is held at gunpoint by Babington is another flight of fancy that relegates this film to the realm of Narnia and Lord of the Rings rather than that of historical drama.

The main redeeming feature is Cate Blanchett's portrayal of the Queen herself. In its perfect combination of humanity, pride, temperament and regal dignity it seems closer to the real Elizabeth than others have ever come; one is made to understand why the English people worshipped her like a half-goddess (and made to forget that at the time of the Armada the Queen was actually a woman of 55; her teeth would most likely have been black. The makers themselves seem confused about her age, having her considering suitors and talking about her fertility). Blanchett's performance is helped in no small way by the terrific costumes, which exuberantly reflect Elizabeth's extravagant taste in dress. In general the film looks gorgeous. It is strange though, and rather absurd, that while the era of this Queen produced a great number of magnificent palaces in a style even named after her, the filmmakers insist on having her live inside Wells cathedral (we get a single, nighttime glimpse of a great Elizabethan house, Burghley, which is apparently where Dr. Dee lives!). The gothic entourage, decorative as it may be, is entirely out of style.

This film is quite different from the earlier one about Elizabeth's rise to the throne, both in style and accuracy. In both regards, the earlier instalment has the edge. This one can be watched for the eyecandy and Cate Blanchett, and as such is enjoyable enough, but as historical drama it is way off.",1205020800,,4383,4.809018567639257

Elizbeth's want as a woman and duty as a Queen is evident throughout this story. As she pushes Bess towards Sir Walter, she flashbacks to her own lost youth. I was surpised to learn that Sir Walter Raleigh was indeed, secretly married to one of her ladies-in-waiting. I do think however, much liberty was taken in the telling of this 'romantic' tale. The costumes are amazing, the story entertaining and acting first rate. England never looked better than when those Spanish ships were sinking and Liz was on the hill looking like the mighty warrior.",1204934400,,704,4.778688524590164
3278821,3,B000ZOXDG4,"I wanted to see this film when it was in the theatres, but it seemed it was gone in the blink of an eye. Having watched this long-awaited DVD, I can see why it had a short run.

I loved the prequel, ""Elizabeth"", and had eagerly looked forward to this sequel. Upon viewing it, I was a tad disappointed.  It totally omits a pivotal character, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, the man who was Elizabeth's confidante and played a vital role in the events of the day. Instead, the screenplay chooses to focus on a supposed romance between Sir Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth, which plays itself out against the backdrop of a serious threat of war with Spain. Unfortunately, this supposed romance simply does not ring true, striking a false note, and therein lies the rub. The screenplay was poorly written, and the film came across as choppy and poorly edited. Consequently, unless one is familiar with the historical events of the day, the viewer might find the plot confusing. On the plus side, the costumes, the sets, and, above all, the acting were magnificent.

Cate Blanchett, as always, is terrific as Elizabeth, although she looked like a woman in her thirties rather than one supposedly in her fifties, which has a somewhat jarring effect. Geoffrey Rush is once again excellent in the role of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spymaster. Clyde Owen makes for a very virile and dashing Sir Walter Raleigh, while Abbie Cornish is delightful as Elizabeth ""Bess"" Throckmorton, the Queen's lady-in-waiting and Raleigh's true love.

While I love period films, I would recommend that one rent, rather than buy, this DVD.  Although I enjoyed the film, somewhat, I was torn between awarding it three or four stars. In the end, however, the crappy script overwhelmed the efforts of its stellar cast. I only hope that if there is to be another sequel that the script rises to the level of the talented cast.

3278823,3,B000ZOXDG4,"The Good Things:
-Looks historically/culturally accurate.
-Pretty good filming style with lots of good-looking shots.
-Excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth (would be comparable to Helen Mirren's performance in ""Elizabeth I"").  Very deep, complex, and moving.
-Clive Owen is in it, and does okay for himself.
-Strong symbolism...I think...

The Bad Things:
-Action scenes are brief.
-Some parts are confusing unless you pay close enough attention.
-Some parts were shot through glass or veils, creating some wierd images (although this could also be a good thing, because it is visually mesmerizing).
-Action scenes are very brief; particuarly dissapointing for seeing the Spanish armada being wiped out.

As a historical drama, this one works quite well.  It has a good style with lots of strong, memorable visuals.  Queen Elizabeth's character stands out tremendously well, and the other characters are not bad either.  However, this is not like watching ""Braveheart"" or anything; there are very few action scenes, and they are brief.  This is a film to see more for the artistic value, history, characters, and emotions, not for battles.

This is the sequel to the 1998 film ""Elizabeth,"" which also had Cate Blanchett, but one could watch this one on its own (the previous one dealt with the earlier stage of her life).",1204675200,,1323,5.23696682464455
3278824,3,B000ZOXDG4,"There is something stubbornly old-fashioned about Shekhar Kapur's 2007 sequel to his 1998 art-house triumph,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth/dp/B000RF7XYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth</a>. I don't mean the newer movie is a stodgy historical pageant. Far from it, all the production values are first-rate, including a relatively seamless use of CGI in the Spanish Armada sequence, but beyond all the pomp and circumstance, the mindset of the story is pure 1940's-era studio melodrama. Set in 1585, the film picks up the Queen's life a quarter century after the first film, and what follows in the strangely cautious screenplay by Michael Hirst and William Nicholson is a simplistic portrait of an aging, superstitious woman aware of her power but ironically at a loss to define her own fate. This period of her life is familiar from a number of previous films and miniseries, but this time, the psychological complexity behind such a fascinating historical figure has been downgraded in favor of romance novel plot turns and paper-thin character development.

The set-up is rich with possibilities only partially realized onscreen. Protestant England is on its knees, as Roman Catholic Spain has become Europe's most powerful country. Now in her early fifties, Elizabeth is vulnerable since Phillip II of Spain is intent on conquering England and especially because she has not married and produced an heir. Next in line is her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, a devout Roman Catholic imprisoned in a castle in Northamptonshire. Elizabeth has proven to be a tolerant ruler as she allows her country's Roman Catholics to maintain their religious beliefs, even though they see Mary as the only rightful Queen. In the meantime, Sir Walter Raleigh has just returned from the New World and stimulated Elizabeth's passion for adventure and her long-dormant desire for romance. Complicating matters is Elizabeth's devoted lady-in-waiting, Bess, a comely beauty who attracts Raleigh's attention. Just as this standard triangle is established, there is a threat on Elizabeth's life known historically as the Babington Plot. Mary is beheaded for her connection to the plot, which gives Philip free rein to gain the Pope's approval to attack England. Elizabeth inspires her troops to face off with the much larger Spanish Armada, and the rest, as they say, is history.

It's no surprise that Cate Blanchett commands the screen in the title role and does her best to fill in the blanks left by the routine script. She manages to imbue the Queen with a hidden vulnerability at which comparatively imperious predecessors like Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson merely hint. The one drawback is that she is too young for the role, a point emphasized by the periodic and somewhat conceited use of flashbacks from the previous film in which her appearance has not changed significantly despite the make-up. Geoffrey Rush returns from the first film as Elizabeth's advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham, but he has less to do this time. As Raleigh, Clive Owen has no problem playing a dashing figure, but he seems more like a romantic's fabrication of what a bodice-ripping swashbuckler should be. Speaking with a strange burr, Samantha Morton has precious few scenes as the fanatical but forgiving Mary, and her pouty face and petulant manner seem at odds with previous characterizations. As Philip, Jordi Moll is forced to play the king as a religious zealot, while Abbie Cornish's Bess strikes me as far too contemporary in manner to be credible as a lady-in-waiting, especially with the ongoing hints of lesbianism and a soft porn-like lovemaking scene with Raleigh.

Guy Dyas' production design, Alexandra Byrne's costumes and Remi Adefarasin's cinematography are all impressive in their splendor and meticulous detail, though I found the music by Craig Armstrong and A.R. Rahman far too intrusive. There are several extras with the 2008 DVD release starting with Kapur's commentary track, often insightful but excessively verbose. An eleven-minute making-of featurette is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film. Three other shorts are included - one on Dyas' intensive work on the production design, one on the recreation of the climactic battle with a mix of ship replicas and CGI, and one on the actual locations used for the filming. There are nine minutes of deleted and extended scenes including one that too-realistically shows Mary's decapitated head. None of these extras helps make the experience of watching this film any more involving.",1204675200,,4649,5.365753424657535

And I thought I could only love Charlize Theron, one of the most beautiful women to ever appear on a movie screen!!! Of course I do have somewhat of a crush on Scarlett Johannson, but don't tell Charlize that. But I digress. Throughout ""Lizzie Two"" most of the cast seemed to be sleepwalking. Clive Owen's portrayal was particularly boring. Errol Flynn would've certainly been much better in the role, but alas and alack, he is no longer with us! The battle scene with the Spanish Armada was really dull and pretty much anti-climactic. And oh, those seemingly endless ""big lighting"" effects with Elizabeth. Maybe this should have been titled ""Elizabeth, The Savior Queen"". I think Kapur should've reviewed some of the period pieces from the 30's and 40's. They usually had the required dash and panache that this one lacks. And what was with all those real high shots? Were they supposed to impress us little people? Some directors just fall in love with themselves after a dash of success. George Lucas' Star War series comes to mind. I gave this two stars only because it is still a cut above Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"", the epitomy of a bad ""historical"" movie. Was Mel already on the ""sauce"" when he made that one? (By the way, I really like Mel's ""We Were Soldiers"", just so you don't think I'm anti-Mel.) Some of these folks in the movie business must have a very low opinion of our intelligence. (Do ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" come to mind?) My other pet peeve about this movie and some others concerns the dialogue. Whatever happened to recording the characters dialogue in a clear, distinct manner. Actors should never be speaking whilst turned away from the camera. And I do have a good sound system in my home. About $4,000.00 worth. I get tired of going back over the same line two or three times trying to understand what is being said!!!

Mostly, I missed Sir Francis Drake. It was weird having the Spanish Armada without him being called away from playing bowls. And there was hardly any discussion of the fire ships and singeing the King of Spain's beard at Cadiz. It is even  more odd when you think that there are so many plays and histories and even science fiction (Dr. Who) that could have provided inspiration (not to say incident). Then, too, this was the age of the most glorious English poetry and prose -- instead we had uninspired dialogs indoors, telling not showing, and long long intervals of  silence.

3278835,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Loosely based on historical occurences, ""Elizabeth - The Golden Age"" is nonetheless a feast for the eyes.  Excellent cinematography and photography are just icing on a cake of superb acting.  Cate Blanchet, Clive Owen and Geoffrey Rush are as excellent as ever in this continuation of Kapur's version of the story of Elizabeth I of England.

In 1585 Elizabeth I turned 53 years of age, and young looking Cate (though mentioning increasing lines in the film) throws back us nerdy history majors who enjoy a good Tudor story.  Elizabeth faces two challenges - Mary Queen of Scotts and Spanish Armada.  The film, like the first one, was filled with intrigue and romanticized versions of Elizabeth's relationships.  There, of course, are accuracies, and I find it funny that some reviewers balk at a historically accurate part of the film.

One of those was the scene in which Elizabeth rides on her horse in her armor to speak to her troops just before the Spanish Armada.  One reviewer called it ""a cheap rip-off of Braveheart.""  In all actuality, Elizabeth did do this, and Kapur did not even include the biggest (and most oft quoted part) of her speech:""I may have a body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have a heart and stomach of a King, and of a King of England, too.""  I wish that Kapur added that part.  Another bit I wish Kapur (who seems set on the dramatic) included, purely for increasing the dramatic by using historically accurate, is the fact that the executioner had to hit Mary Queen of Scotts' neck twice in order to sever the head.  After beheading, Mary's wig fell off as her head rolled on the floor, exposing wispy white hair of a once beautiful woman, resulting in an undignified death for a dignified monarch, who went to her death with her head held high.

Clive Owen does an excellent job as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Geoffrey Rush shines as Sir Francis Walsingham.  In fact, the entire cast is stellar and they fully carry the somewhat rushed film, helped by stunning photography.  Musical pieces used in the first Elizabeth helped connect with that film.  Kapur is planning on doing a third Elizabeth film.  Although mostly historically inaccurate, the Elizabeth films are beautifully done, and highly recommended.",1203465600,,2239,4.7890625
3278836,3,B000ZOXDG4,"The first hours of ETGA was thrilling. Elizabeth (the ever-awesome Cate Blanchett) reigns with confidence and charm. She is held in fearful esteem by her people, whom she swears to protect. But treachery is afoot, in the lingering presence of Catholics in England after the Reformation, and Elizabeth worries about the intentions of her captive cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. Meanwhile, Elizabeth plays a teasing game with suitors from around Europe, each hoping to make her his queen. Enter the dashing and roguish Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) fresh from his discovery of Virginia, named for his beloved virgin queen. Raleigh charms his way into Elizabeth's court, and encounters a monarch who is vulnerable in spite of her adamantine exterior. All of this plays out against the threat from Spanish King Philip, busy building a fleet of ships to recapture England for the Church and to depose the ""illegitimate"" Elizabeth.

As I said, the first half of the film was wonderful -- well-written, clever, visually stunning. The costumes were gorgeous, intricate and convincing. The acting was subtle and believable. It was touching to see Elizabeth grappling with husbandless middle age. But close to the halfway mark, the film founders and never recovers. Inexplicably, Raleigh (who heretofore had the hots for the queen herself) falls for one of her courtesans. This injects a silly ""forbidden love"" element into the film. After this, the movie ricochets from one movie clich to another. Elizabeth, uncovering a plot by her cousin to take the throne, is disconsolate at the thought of executing a God-appointed queen. This in spite of her father's unstated lack of scruples in beheading E's mother, Anne Boleyn. Philip sets Jesuit plots into spin and launches the Spanish Armada against England. With odds overwhelmingly favoring Spain, will Elizabeth let her darling Raleigh out of prison to take on the Spanish? Will she regain the composure needed to lead her besieged people to victory? Will the manly Raleigh manage to get off his burning ship on time? By the time the movie ended, I really did not care. I no longer believed the character's motivations and lost hope that the movie's loose threads (OK, was E OK with Catholics or bent on hunting them down?) would be tidied up. Having abandoned any hope that the filmmakers would be able to dramatize the panoply of events, the film settles for set pieces. Elizabeth is seen in her flowing nightie, gazing out to sea at the burning enemy ships -- which are clearly visible one moment and enshrouded by fierce storms the next. Symbolic scenes (e.g., the one in which E, perfectly-coiffed and costumed, is circled dizzyingly by the camera) alternate confusingly with literal scenes full of extras. Reconciled with her status as mother of her country, she blesses the child of a couple who should have suffered her regal wrath for having ignored the need for her permission to marry.

""Elizabeth, The Golden Age"" had so much going for it. But by trying to tell so many tales at once, it managed to tell none of them well. A disappointment to all but the most ardent Blanchett and Owen fans.",1203379200,,3152,4.96780303030303

3278839,3,B000ZOXDG4,"The '00 release `Elizabeth - the Golden Age' is a visually stunning but overall ponderous exercise clearly showing how difficult the making of a worthy sequel can be. While the production values, costumes, soundtrack and cast are superb it's definitely lacking the magical ""something"" that raises a good film to a great one.

There are some haunting cinematic moments not soon to be forgotten such as the sight of Elizabeth standing on a distant cliff along the dark and stormy coastline viewing the Spanish Armanda ablaze on the horizon, or the image of Elizabeth garbed in white armor with matching horse extolling the troops to greatness as her long flowing red hair and demeanor bears a striking resemblance to Saint Joan of Arc.

Unfortunately the role of the legendary monarch is not fleshed out to the extent as it was in the script of the first film, leaving Cate Blanchett little new territory to explore within the psyche of the Virgin Queen. She is left with little to do other than vacillate between a compulsive control freak and a lonely, scorned lover along with occasionally striking a Madonna-like pose while the majestic soundtrack blares in the background clearly attempting to instill within the mind of the viewer a sense of awe and holiness.

On the positive side, the most interesting addition to the storyline is Clive Owen in the role of explorer Walter Raleigh. It's only in Blancehtt's scenes with Clive that her character is allowed to show any emotional or intellectual depth. On a more personal basis, being by nature inclined to the arcane, I particularly appreciated the inclusion of the royal seer Dr. John Dee in the storyline.

3278840,2,B000ZOXDG4,"In the original Elizabeth we saw the title character transform from an inexperienced twenty-something into a queen by hardening her heart and learning the ways of cutthroat politics.  So, why in the sequel is she portrayed as a hysterical teenager?  The filmmakers didn't see fit to transfer any of what made the original character so great into the sequel.  Instead of the assured queen at the end of Elizabeth, in Elizabeth: The Golden Age we are treated to an insecure monarch reacting to a midlife crisis by acting half her age.

King Philip of Spain is amassing an armada to invade England.  He sees the Protestant queen as a spot of darkness in a Catholic world, even though, despite urgings to do so by her own counsel, she refuses to persecute Catholics in her own kingdom.  If this wasn't enough, her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, is planning to assassinate Queen Elizabeth and take the English throne.  In the midst of these political machinations is a love triangle between the explorer Walter Raleigh, Elizabeth, and one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting.

For all of the intrigue and subplots, not much happens for the first half of the film and instead of political intrigue the audience is forced to endure another love scene where the two romantics ride horses in the countryside.  Raleigh and Elizabeth's relationship is utterly unconvincing.  I cannot understand how anyone but the most nave would be taken in on Raleigh's ""philosophical musings"" about how when death closes in during a storm it only makes you want to live more, to which Elizabeth replies with wide eyes, ""Yes, to live!""  It sounds like the kind of life philosophy that would fit nicely in between sketches of unicorns and rainbows.

The looming threat of the Inquisition accompanies the Spanish armada, even though we are never shown the religious intolerance of the Inquisition.  The menace would have loomed larger if the audience was aware of just exactly what was at stake.  The first film had the tremendous opening where Protestant heretics were burnt at the stake, would it have been too much for a similar reminder that Europe still had one foot in the Dark Ages?  Perhaps director Shekhar Kapur felt the dialogue was already enough torture for his audience.

In the film's defense, it does fulfill the historical film's need for extravagance in costume and cinematography.  However, looking pretty just isn't enough.  After the extraordinary introduction to Elizabeth in the first film the last thing an audience wants to watch is a digression.  If the film is about her rise to world dominance, then why does it feel as if Blanchett's playing the role of a washed up actress, past her prime and unable to get her agent on the phone?  It seems as if Elizabeth is more concerned with aging than she is with running her country.  The central metaphor to the film is that of a storm, which is uttered from the lips of many characters, and to be sure when you finish watching Elizabeth: The Golden Age, you'll feel as if you've weathered one yourself.",1203206400,,3041,4.820809248554913

The film deals with some of the most famous events of Elizabeth's reign - the Babington Plot which led directly to the trial and execution of Mary Queen of Scots, the invasion of the Spanish armada, encounters with Walter Raleigh.  Don't come to this expecting an education; the film has only a nodding acquaintance with historical facts.

As you would expect, the visual quality of the DVD is outstanding.  The disc's special features include deleted scenes; short subjects on the making of the film; the reign of Elizabeth; creating the armada; towers, courts, and cathedrals; and a director's commentary.

Yes, the costumes were spectacular, the photography superlative, and the scenery breathtaking; in other words, this film is filled with eye candy. Cate Blanchett played the awesomely beautiful queen and I was transfixed by her performance - something that normally doesn't happen to me when I go to a movie.

Granted, there may be many historical inaccuracies in this film but I didn't buy a ticket to receive an education - I use other sources (such a books) to accomplish that. (What a concept!)

3278845,4,B000ZOXDG4,"While this sequel to the 1998 film Elizabeth pales in comparision, it still finds some nice moments in a film that seems more content on the film more as a work of moving art, with its lavish costumes, gorgeous sets, and stunning cinematography, and yet human development somehow gets lost beyond all the pretty pictures and lovely costumes.

Elizabeth's reign as queen is once again in peril. King Philip of Spain plans on Holy War against England and the protestant queen that rules it and plots of assaisination begin to form under the control of Mary Queen of Scots. All the while, Elizabeth finds her heart once again caught in the battle, as she takes notice of a dashing pirate, Sir Walter Reiligh.

What's the film suffers is its seemingly vacant story line and the near absent soapy drama that made the first film so entertaining to watch. the director has all this great history to go upon and yet he seems more intent on the look of the film then the actual feel of it. As for Geoffry Rush, his character is reduced to nothing more but a side note that does not carry the same effect as he did in the first film.

But the good thing is that on aspect of the first film did not change and that would be Cate Blanchett's performence. Still just as fierce as in the first film, she brings back all of the aspects of our Queen that we knew and love. With a bitting wit, steely determination, and the ability to show weakness at just the right moment, Blanchett is able infuse just enough life into a film that, without, would probally be entierly dead.",1202515200,,1559,4.463157894736842
3278846,4,B000ZOXDG4,"ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-German/dp/B000OY8NBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good German</a>).

With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.

The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, ""Bess"" (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shoot-Em-Up/dp/B000XA5K48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shoot 'Em Up</a>).

Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).

The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.

Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.

This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, ""Yeah. Seen it. Been there.""",1202515200,,3057,5.649237472766885
3278847,4,B000ZOXDG4,"2007's ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" picks up the story of Queen Elizabeth in 1585.  The young and uncertain woman who became Queen in ""Elizabeth"" is now the mature and confident icon of her people.  Cate Blanchett reprises her role as Elizabeth.

Director Shekhar Kapur sets three plot threads in motion at the beginning of ""The Golden Age.""  The first is Elizabeth's life at court, as she manages her counselors, a simmering rivalry between Protestants and Catholics, and proposals of marriage from a variety of foreign suitors. The lonely Elizabeth dotes on young ""Bess"" Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), a young, attractive and trusted lady in waiting.  Enter Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), handsome swashbuckling seadog and explorer, who widens Elizabeth's horizons with tales of a new world and bewitches her heart with his charm.

The second thread is the plotting of disgruntled Catholics against the Protestant Elizabeth.  Elizabeth's aging spymaster Walsingham (nicely reprised by Geoffrey Rush) seeks to guard her against assassination.  Her Catholic cousin and rival Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), is imprisoned in England but schemes with English and Spanish agents against Elizabeth.

The third thread is the threat posed by Philip II, King of Spain.  As defender of the Catholic faith, Philip intends to depose Elizabeth and is gathering a mighty naval armada and army for that purpose.

These three plot threads are linked, sometimes in surprising ways, and they will come together to threaten Elizabeth's hold on the throne.  The savage interrogation of an arrested Catholic plotter uncovers the Spanish threat to England, while driving Bess Throckmorton into the arms of Walter Raleigh.  A failed plot against Elizabeth's life ensnares Mary Stuart, leaving Elizabeth with an agonizing choice of punishment.  Philip's armada enters the English Channel and Elizabeth must rally England's tiny navy and army to face an invasion.

Ultimately, this becomes too many moving parts to manage gracefully.  Director Kapur handles the triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh, and Bess Throckmorton with delicate precision to a reasonably satisfying conclusion.  However, he chooses to interpret Mary Stuart's involvement in an assassination plot to suggest that the whole was a scheme of Philip to justify going to war (a more common interpretation is that the canny Walsingham gave Mary Stuart enough rope to hang herself).  The battle with the Spanish Armada is a series of melodramatic visuals laden with religious overtones that must have been close to incomprensible to American audiences unfamiliar with English history.  Philip, in real life an outstanding chief executive of a far-flung empire, is reduced to caricature as a gnome-like fanatic muttering threats in candle-lit royal chapels.

""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is a visually stunning treat, taking full advantage of lavish sets and costumes to present a sense of place and time.  The underlying theme of the original ""Elizabeth"" movie is reinforced with a vengeance, as Elizabeth must sacrifice her personal desires to rule and safeguard England as an iconic mother figure.  A strong cast helps carry the day.  This movie is recommended as solid entertainment to fans of costume drama and period pieces.",1202515200,,3281,5.415354330708661

3278849,3,B000ZOXDG4,"ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE isn't golden.  Expectations were high after Cate Blanchett's first foray in 1998 as Elizabeth I, but somehow this follow-up film, with the same director (Shekhar Kapur) and writer (Michael Hirst with assistance from William Nicholson), does not reach those heights.  Visually stunning, with an endless array of knockout costumes for Blanchett, special effects and scenery as majestic as any that have been photographed by fine cinematographer Remie Adefarasin and a musical score by Craig Armstrong and AR Rahman - all of these fine attributes cannot cover the weak script and the general lack of character development that hampers the usually exceptional core of actors.

The portion of Elizabeth's history covered by the film is the battle with Spain, England being the only country not participating in the Holy War in Europe under the direction of King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Moll&agrave;), complete with the surprise decimation of the approaching Spanish Armada due to the heroism and commitment of Elizabeth with her people.  The surrounding events include Elizabeth's dalliance with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the traumatic (for Elizabeth) beheading of Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), under the advisement of Elizabeth's trusted Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).

Blanchett is a consummate actress and manages to inhabit the persona of Elizabeth as much with her glances and body language and silences as with  the meager material from the script.  She IS a Queen reborn.  The remainder of the cast is adequate though shallow, and while each has very little to say they maintain an atmosphere of Elizabethan England.  This is a DVD that could well be watched without the soundtrack and still be entertaining for the visual splendors. It could have been so much more.

Sir Walter Raleigh is somewhat interesting, as is the queen's favorite lady, Bess--but the story isn't supposed to be about them, is it?
It's also incredibly irritating to watch scene after scene of actors being filmed through frosted glass. Apparently the director and cinematographer couldn't think of anything else to do.

3278851,4,B000ZOXDG4,"Almost a decade later, director Shekhar Kapur follows up his critically acclaimed Elizabeth with Elizabeth: The Golden Age which includes the ethereal Cate Blanchett reprising her role as the famous regent.

Now firmly settled into her throne, this second film follows Elizabeth facing the crisis of the invasion of the famous Spanish Armada. In addition to this she also has to deal with an internal crisis as she starts having great affection for Sir Walter Raleigh (played by Clive Owen)--a pirate staying at the court. She obviously is unable to marry him being that she is the Queen, and a queen who has already refused many offers of princes from all of Europe.

This is a glorious, sumptuous epic with award-caliber production. The cinematography is some of the best I have seen since Titanic, and the sets and costumes are magnificent. The sweeping score blends all the scenes together perfectly. Cate Blanchett's performance stands out from the star-studded cast as she reprises her role with a ferocious intensity.

I have only one complaint with the film. It is the fact that the director changed Elizabeth's character into a woman publicly longing and pursuing a man in ways that reminded me of a giddy love-struck teenage girl with their first crush. It seemed out of character for a regally mature, sophisticated queen who should already have experienced such things and outwardly have moved on.

This film is quite different in tone as the other one. It is much tamer (garnering a PG-13 rating compared to the R rating of the other one) and more entertaining with the love story and the climatic battle at the end. Even with the change and the rather major complaint the film manages to be a stunningly produced, acted, and compellingly wrought epic piece of cinema. It makes me hope Kapur will make the third of his planned Elizabethan trilogy.",1202256000,,1860,4.914012738853503
3278852,5,B000ZOXDG4,"This is truly an original cinematic experience. I have never seen such a personal and compelling film biography. It continues the legacy began by ""Elizabeth I."" Every moment was filled with such noble and human living. It simply astounds me that so many reviewers didn't realize that this was a Jungian study in the clash of a major archtype with the world in which she lived and ruled. This Elizabeth was superbly realized with none of the ticks of Bette Davis or the overt sexuality of Helen Mirren. Blanchett gave us a chance to see into the real Virgin Queen. This woman was not sexually frustrated, but in full control of her passions tempered with grace and personal integrity. She claimed her life and owned it with every fiber of her being. The supporting cast was perfect down to Tom Hollander as Mary Stuart's jailor. Samantha Morton gave an exquisite portrayal of a queen caught in the force of history. Clive Owen, as usual, was every inch the hero archtype.

If you have any sense of what it is to an individual in a heartless society, you will never get a moment to breathe, so mesmerizing is Kapur's direction and the simply balletic cinematography. Every costume is a statement of the character's feelings at every moment and the progression of color leads you to the ending that you know you're going to reach, but still can't is going to come to fruition.

In the decades to come, ""Elizabeth-The Golden Age"" will become the movie that the critics just didn't know how to approach. In this year of absolutely mediocre films (excepting ""Michael Clayton"")I cannot believe that this film was not on everybody's Top Ten List.

But then we as a film-going public do not appreciate the operatic, the sensuous, the heroic. We gravitate toward the bleak, violent worlds of the Coen Brothers and Clint Eastwood that foster hopelessness and alienation.

3278853,2,B000ZOXDG4,"Alas and anon...just when you thought it was safe to assemble an armada and go back into the water, someone goes and produces another costumer concerning a certain virgin queen. Bollywood director Shekhar Kapur has re-enlisted co-conspirators Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush for one more go at the old girl in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"".

Picking up a few decades hence from where he left off in his outstanding 1998 film ""Elizabeth"", which depicted the ascendancy of the title character, Kapur cheekily condenses a turbulent and historically significant 4-year period (1585-1588) during the reign of Elizabeth I into what appears to be a rather eventful week in the life of HRM.

As the film opens, we are introduced to a much more wary and care-worn monarch (an alarmingly thin Blanchett) holding court over England's destiny. Gone is the radiant, rosy-cheeked and free-spirited ""Bess"" who lit up the screen in the previous film; she has been replaced by a mercurial, slightly paranoid monarch who is constantly on guard against duplicitous well-wishers and sycophants. Even her closest confidants are kept at arm's length, especially her Machiavellian ""spymaster"", Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).

The Queen has two big headaches keeping her on edge. The first is her cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland (Samantha Morton, in a fiercely intense performance) who feels she is the rightful heir to the English throne, not the childless [...]  Elizabeth (who is a Protestant to boot). Mary has some influential Catholic sympathizers at home and abroad, including the other royal pain in Elizabeth's derriere, King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Molla), who gets his jollies jeering at the English queen and rattling his saber.

Elizabeth finds a temporary distraction from all her political woes when the dashing adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, in all his rangy glory) strolls into her court, full of tales and loaded with booty from his latest excursion to the New World. Elizabeth is obviously charmed, but has to suppress her schoolgirl crush for sake of appearances. However, when she learns that Raleigh has fathered a child and secretly eloped with her favorite chambermaid, Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish) she is not so amused, and gives him a nice cozy jail cell to explore for a few years. Not to worry, however-history intervenes and the Queen pardons Raleigh in time to put him in charge of naval defenses in the year of the Armada (1588), which fuels the film's climatic battle scenes.

I have to warn you, this is one of those ""historical"" epics where you have to make a decision going in whether you are going to nitpick and get cranky and argumentative over factual inaccuracies and behavioral anachronisms, or just sit back for two hours and enjoy the opulent pageantry and bodice-ripping court intrigue with a $#!+-eating  grin on your face. Keep in mind that the screenplay was authored by William Nicholson, who scripted the (very) loose re-interpretation of the Camelot legend, ""First Knight"" and Michael Hirst, who wrote several episodes of Showtime's recent mini-series about Henry VIII, ""The Tudors"". In other words, this ain't ""Masterpiece Theater"", folks.

Kapur does seem indecisive at times; it's as if he wasn't sure whether he wanted to make an updated version of ""Fire Over England"" (which depicted Elizabeth and Raleigh embroiled in court intrigue in the year of the Armada) or pay homage to ""The Sea Hawk"" (the swashbuckling action scenes featuring Owens in full Errol Flynn mode will definitely make history majors twitch). Nicholson and Hirst's dialogue fuels some spirited exchanges between Blanchett and Owen in the first half of the film that reminded me of the clever repartee from ""Shakespeare in Love "", but it ultimately clashes with some of the heavier moments later on (Samantha Morton nearly steals the movie in her execution scene, but it seems to belong in a completely different and darker-toned film).

If you are a fan of the genre, you will likely be pleased. Blanchett is
excellent in the lead role, and Owen is charismatic as always. Rush is good, although his character is a bit one-dimensional (not his fault).

An unholy mixture of the banal and the bombastic, this 2007 film once again stars Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth I, who spends much of her time flouncing around in outr outfits that seem more Kabuki than England circa 1585. (No doubt they are historically accurate. Who would have the nerve to invent them?)

Blanchett, miraculously gives a good performance, even when saddled with lines like this one, to Clive Owen's Sir Walter Raleigh: ""In another world, could you have loved me?"" Maybe, but in the world of this film, with a score that's positively deafening, it's amazing that she could even hear herself.

This handsomely mounted film, in its cute ADD way, quickly forgets its half-hearted early attempts to make History Relevant to What Is Going On in the World Today and soon morphs into a sort of Classic Comics on acid, or the longest Eurythmics video ever made. This time around, the Virgin Queen is up to her ruffled collars in romantic and political intrigues, mostly revolving around the dashing Raleigh and her cousin Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), respectively. History tells us that when the film opens in 1585, Elizabeth, who has been on the throne for 27 years, is 52 years old, and that Raleigh is 19 years her junior. Blanchett, if anything, looks younger than her 38 years - and Owen, in real life, is five years older than Blanchett. But they're both so good-looking that you can accept the queen making goo-goo eyes over the poetry-spouting Sir Walter, who returns from the New World just after she's endured a bad-date montage of potential suitors.

Or is Liz actually smitten with her lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton (played by Abbie Cornish), who infuriates the queen by getting pregnant by Walt? This triangle appears to be inspired less by any historical evidence than by THE VIRGIN QUEEN, a 1955 Hollywood travesty wherein Liz, Walt and Bess were played by the more-age appropriate Bette Davis, Richard Todd and Joan Collins.

Meanwhile, Spanish Queen, er, King Philip II (a mincing Jordi Molla) is plotting to restore England to Catholicism by encouraging the Sceptr'd Isle's Catholics to revolt and install Mary on the throne. Phil's agents trick Elizabeth's spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), into thinking Mary is part of the conspiracy - providing Morton with a nifty execution scene and the Spanish an excuse to launch the Armada. Sir Walt gets sprung and named director of Homeland Security. Damn history and full speed ahead! Somehow he ends up leading the British fleet in some obviously CGI'd sea battles, even swinging from the masthead and diving off a burning ship.

At the same time, our girl Liz - who has modeled a succession of costumes that make those in the far less entertaining MARIE ANTOINETTE look positively dowdy - is gotten up in armor and delivers what appears to be an advance draft of the St. Crispin's Day speech from Henry IV. (If there are any history majors left in the audience by the time this scene comes up, the sound you will hear will be all of them screaming ""uncle."")

Presumably she, Shakespeare and Lord Essex will be heading off to explore America in Kapur's threatened third installment. Can't wait.",1201996800,,3400,4.894097222222222
3278855,4,B000ZOXDG4,"After reading some of the reviews I was a little shocked that there was so much to do over the lack of historical accuracy.  This is hollywood not the PBS. I thought the peformances were wonderful, the costumes and sets were magnificent and the story solid. Story, not history. Just goes to show that you will never please everyone and it is good to have varied points of view. SEE IT :)",1201910400,,387,4.375
3278856,5,B000ZOXDG4,"I had some reservations about this film before venturing to see it at the cinema. The rating, PG-13, was lower than the R the first movie had which brought a degree of trepidation about the content being watered down. As well as that I wondered if it would indeed be possible to achieve the degree of excellence which the first film had met.

Having watched this film again several times on DVD I believe that although the current film has not achieved the same degree of oppulent excellence as the first it has come pretty close. It is clear that the lower rating is intended to attract a wider audience and the naughtiness which abounded in the first film is still there in the second although not so obvious.

Both films display a degree of enlightenment of how to perceive the past. Others have characterised the Elizabeth films as mere historical dramas and romances and to a degree those perceptions are correct insofar as the settings go. However, this is, to me at least, a superficial interpretation but other perspectives have greater strength.

Growing up in England, I was exposed to wonderful television programmes and films which depicted a historical portrayal of merrie olde Englande which was very historically inaccurate. I used to believe that the grimy industrial England portrayed by Dickens amongst others was an inferior time of high infant mortality, short live spans and very Hobbesian in nature. Until, that is, I discovered that Dickens was paid by the word and to keep his readers interested he portrayed the country in such a way that they would crave for more. Simialrly, closer examination of merrie olde Englande showed that it was not very merry at all.

In conjunction with that, history of human sexuality was largely began from Victorian times with their sense of prudishness and repression and it has been falsely claimed that much of current life was non-existant before so-called modern times.

Viewed from these perspectives both fims shed a different light on events of Elizabethan times. Elizabeth is not a single strong woman, she is a survivor against men who resent her grip on power. She was, like Margaret Thatcher, the strongest ""man"" of her time. Similarly the record of the times showed that although there were certain societal rules which needed to be followed, they were often broken but unless they were discovered and exposed they continued. Feints within feints as Frank Herbert would write in Dune.

What I love about these films, aside from their radical perspective on past events and the personalities of the time, is their focus on intrigue and plots. The machinations of the Catholic Church as exemplified by Philip of Spain in the battle to prevent the supremacy of the Anglican church from occuring, the jockeying for power utilising religion as a front, the godfather ruthlessness of the time and indeed the correlation with the penultimate scenes of that movie, all within times which were supposedly much simpler than our own.

Ultimately though Elizabeth is human, a woman, a woman of strength who subborns her own needs and desires to those of her country. Elizabeth the consumate politician. Is this a story of Elizabeth I or the current monarch residing on the throne of the United KIngdom? Sometimes one wonders, not least in the role of the closest of her advisers.

There is much for thought and entertainment in this film. Blanchett's performance is stunning once more and Clive Owen has come a long way since his Chancer days. All in all this is an excellent film and will be judged as such in the longer term.",1201910400,,3586,4.886513157894737
3278857,4,B000ZOXDG4,"I took the trouble to go to the theatre to see it. Kate Blanchett makes a fine Elizabeth. I tried watching the Helen Mirren performance and could only say to myself ""it looks like one of those awful PBS Shakespeare performances""
  The scenes with the Spanish Armada were particularly awful. Elizabeth's astral spirit runs out onto what I assume are the cliffs of Dover so she can watch the battle on the waves. The music soars and we get the impression the she is some kind of saint saving Christendom from the evil Catholic Phillip. Well I guess the British are entitled to their fantasies.
  She had cut off all her hair to wear wigs but in the climactic speech to I think about 150 troops she has on what has to be the most amazing Elizabethan wig. The poor women begs for a hug from Raleigh because she's such a frustrated old maid, I guess.
  A scene is inserted where an asassin forgets to shoot her. He has a gun, a clear shot, and decides that she is such a goddess I guess that he can't kill her. You wouldn't see Hammas being that weak. This never happened. I still recommend watching this one.  I have a suggestion for movie makers. How about Isabella the Catholic next?

As to this melting pot unrequited love, wonderful scenes from history, who can forget Raleight and the cloak over the puddles scene, as well as murder, treason and intrigue, don't forget Mary Queen of Scots here, and of course Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's right hand man and Britain's first true spymaster and you have a film that totally takes your breath away.

Forget the fact that historically there are probably more holes in it than a Swiss Cheese, the movie follows the spirit of the era in my opinion and is worth seeing just for the quality acting from Cate Blanchett as the passionate Elizabeth, Geoffry Rush as the deadly Walsingham, and the lovely Samantha Morton as the doomed Mary Queen of Scots, along with sumptious constumes, a great soundtrack, some nifty special effects.

I liked this film, it is as good if not better than the film Elizabeth and its a real shame it has not been nominated for more Oscars, certainly it deserved it considering what did get nominated this year!",1201305600,,1562,5.265060240963855

Well, you shouldn't be able to tell her age and generally too much knowledge of history will spoil the fun. When the movie started I decided to follow Coleridge's advice to ""suspend my disbelief"" and enjoyed it OK.
You don't get a lesson in history here (a very general but shouldn't you have known before about the Armada?) you get a picturesque vision of history and as such it works. Some twists made me smile. I found it quite amusing that all Roman Catholics look ugly and their behaviour is rather irrational. A comment to the ending - Elisabeth left England in debts (although not bankrupt as Philip did) and the quoted ""age of prosperity"" led directly to the Civil War half a century later.

3278861,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I won't write 1,000+ words ranting or raving on about this film, but I will put in a few remarks without simply listing out a detailed summary of the film. A little background, I saw the original Elizabeth in 1998 when I was in high school and loved it; it's still one of my favorite movies of all time. I am a history buff in the strictest sense, I have a bachelors and masters in history and am now working on a PhD in British history in the UK, but I still love good movies. The first Elizabeth film admittedly had its flaws, but in the end it generally got across an accurate enough story. When I heard a sequel was being made, I was so excited. And then I saw this crap...
Kapur said that he wanted this movie to be different from the first, as if he was making a totally different film, and boy did he succeed, but probably not in the way he intended. First of all, the characters were cardboard stereotypes and poorly written, directed and even acted. Don't get me wrong, I love Cate Blanchett, she's one of my favorites of all time, but in her defense, you can only do so much with what you are given. This Elizabeth is a one-dimensional, zombie of a spinster who the movie makers try so obviously and painfully to spell out for the audience that she isn't a woman that they want people to identify with, in fact they try in every way they can to set her apart as being as obviously abnormal as they can. For the whole movie she speaks in the same, old, monotone, voice, just like some kind of robot. It's painful to see such a great actress having to stunt all of her talent to force out such a stilted and shoddily developed character. The sloppy, sloppy attempt to show Elizabeth as having a possibly sexual relationship with Bess was just ridiculous and so poorly done that it ended up being insulting to the intelligence of the audience and even more so to the GLBT community by being so terribly written and performed.
Equally as insulting was the depiction of Philip II. Was it really necessary to depict the Spanish Armada as losing their battle because they didn't notice approaching English fire ships because they were so feverishly involved in what was depicted as cultish prayer? Give the Spanish a little more credit than that, and give the English a little more credit at being able to defeat their enemies for reasons beyond their inability to observe approaching enemies...
And one last thing, the one thing that I as an historian was picky about and was looking for going into the theater: showing Mary Queen of Scots as having a thick Scottish brogue? Seriously? Anyone who knows anything more about Mary than the pulp fiction legends and myths of the woman know that she grew up in France. It was an immediate signal to me that this film was going on sham research and would be pandering to an audience who they felt wouldn't notice or perhaps even care that they weren't just taking artistic liberties with histories but were turning it into a poorly written soap opera that wouldn't even be up to the level of quality one would expect on daytime TV.
I only wish I could erase the memories of this movie from my mind and only remember the first Elizabeth film. If you want to see a well-done portrayal of the later years of the life of Elizabeth I which is up to the level of that first film, I would suggest that you instead watch 'Elizabeth I' with Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons.",1199750400,,3410,4.431528662420382
3278862,1,B000ZOXDG4,"This was one movie I really hope that it will be impressive but as it turned out, it proves to be a really lousy movie. Cate Blanchett proves to be superb but she can't save a sinking ship like this movie.

I am not going to get into details about the historical accuracy since like the first Elizabeth, this is more like a historical fantasy closer to the Lord of the Rings then history of Britain. But I would say this, the director really sucks and whoever wrote the script needs to be taken out and flog, and finally, who did the editing in this movie should not have any children of their own. Simply put, these three elements of the movie failed the paying customers badly.

This movie appears to be a visual feast without a coherent story. We have poor Cate doing a lot of standing still, a lot close-up in her great costumes and a lot of staring. And yes, it quite visually fantastic and it would even be more if there was a developing script to all this. The movie appears to be over-edited as the plot move from scene to scene, each scene almost independent from other scenes. What you get as a result is a movie that don't make a lot of sense and where characters do things that don't flow with other scenes.

Since the movie is a historical fantasy in the first place, I wondered why the people who made this movie make a pretense of history? If they are going to throw away the history books, do so and create a script and a movie that flow and tell a story - like the first Elizabeth did. That film is a total fantasy and that is why it worked just fine. This is why this movie was such a killer of time, for people who were making fantasy movie, they tried to turn it into some sort of historical epic!!

This plain jane DVD (Amazon's description) won't cut the mustard. This movie really needs to be reedited and re-shot in-order to be save. I doubt if that will occur.",1198627200,,1885,4.256983240223463
3278863,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Sometimes I wonder just how much thought critics put into how hard it is to create the films they so gleefully shred in their reviews. Hundreds of actors, artists, technicians, and workers slave away for years to produce something in the mind's eye of one crazed director who channels it through one or two exhausted actors, and what comes out of the effort is more than a film, it is years of their life they will never get back, spend willingly to give you ENTERTAINMENT, or perhaps even, (dare we say it?) ART.

Not that it isn't hard to tell the difference between the two sometimes. When a movie makes you want to stand-up and cheer is it entertainment? When a film makes you want to cry is it art? Then you have movies like this one, where maybe you feel a little like doing both. I guess that just makes it a good and worthy movie, perhaps even great.

Cate Blanchett, one of the great actors of our time, so much more than a movie star, as she crafts her roles with a genius that you completely believe her in the characters she plays. Of course I knew her name long before the first Elizabeth came out (thanks to my sister Codemaster Talon), and could appreciate her enormous talent. It did appear that she would always be great and never be famous because of the sort of roles she always chose to play (period pieces and such), but like the amazing Gerard Butler, or the controversial Russel Crowe, sometimes history, if Hollywoodized a bit, can make for a rather entertaining film that might even be thought by some to be art, and that sort of thing often makes the lead actor famous...and the movie an EPIC.

Again, an Epic is a hard movie to make, particularly if the studios aren't throwing money around like snowballs Christmas day. I never saw the first Elizabeth (call that irony), but I heard great things. So naturally when I saw the trailer for this movie during the particularly dry season of interesting-looking movies, I wanted to see what it was all about. Actually, the real reason I wanted to see it was that it had so many great actors working together on the same historical epic (and I love epics!). Clive Owen (I first loved him in the BMW commercials known as ""The Hire"", and I still think he was great in King Arthur) as a charming historical pirate (errr...PRIVATEER), Geoffry Rush as the wizened old advisor, (the always wonderful Samantha Morton as the imprisoned rival Mary) and or course Cate Blanchett as the impossibly strong, noble, proud, GREATEST ruler England has ever known. If that isn't enough to grab your attention anymore I don't know what is.

From the previews, one might think this movie solely about Enlgand's fight against the Spanish Armada, and indeed that is the climax of the movie. But there is much that comes before. This movie actually features three major plot points/story arcs. Firstly, there is the drama that is Mary Queen of Scotts, wherein said rival, of course believing that SHE is the rightful Queen of England, plots and schemes to bring down Elizabeth whilst still in captivity. It's great stuff. Like so MANY people in this movie, the hardship of the times, heavy superstition, the harshness of life, has led to a kind of fanatical insanity. Mary is convinced that Elizabeth is a devil, and herself a saint. God is on her side, should she fail she will be taken to heaven forthwith. There's something almost noble about someone with that particular brand of insanity, believing in themself and the rightness of their desires no matter WHAT. When she dies (as history dictates she must), it is one of the greatest death scenes I have ever seen. Brilliantly directed too.

The Queen the handmaiden and the Pirate

The second story arc is about sometime pirate/explorer Walter Raleigh, and his relationship with the Queen and her Lady-in-Waiting dear friend. I gotta say, it's really great to see Clive Owen playing a character who isn't a total downer. Granted, he can play serious characters brilliantly, but sometimes kinda feel sorry for him, like maybe he's really terminally depressed and just playing himself onscreen. At any rate, this character is a charmer, and I absolutely love the way Owen plays him. This love triangle is about something hard to describe, but easy to feel if you are familiar. Owen loves the Queen with all his heart, but he knows from the get-go that anything ROMANTIC would only cheapen and weaken her as a person. So he is VERY honored and privileged to love her from a distance, emotionally if not physically. He expresses openly his dedication and affection for her, but naturally, being only human, she wishes it was something more romantic and less idealistic, in her heart, since she knows deep down such a thing can never be. When a romance develops between the Queen's lady and her knight, she is understandably furious, because to her it symbolizes something that she knew she could never have, snatched away forever by one she thought her dearest friend. The poor Queen failed to realize (the way that I see it), that it was actually just another way for the man to become closer to her by making part of her his own. The best scenes from this segment of the movie are Raleigh's repeatedly asking to be sent away to start a colony, and repeatedly being forced to stay by the Queen who simply will not let him go. The best scene in my opinion is the one where she gives him a high position which attaches him to her permanently, and the look on his face when he receives it, a bit like she just ran him through with a sword. Deep down the Queen must know that for a man like it making him stay home is like shooting his horse or burning his ship before his eyes, but naturally a person with such great power can't imagine how making her happy could possibly not make everyone happy (the quick exchanges between Raleigh and Elizabeth during moments of friction are brilliant).

The Spanish Armada

Okay, so from the trailers what you REALLY wanted to see was a huge battle sequence at the end with the whole Spanish Armada and the English fleet clashing in an epic climax. Well, in that case... you may be let down. The whole thing felt more than a bit anti-climactic, and was oven way too quickly. Ended almost as quickly as it actually started, despite all the build-up. I was really hoping for more, maybe some actual historical detail in the days that it took for the battle for control of the world to be decided. But all in all, it's not enough to kill the movie by any means.

If you love history, love Cate Blanchett and find politics and England fascinating subjects you're sure to find this a fun movie. Definitely a rental at least. Maybe more if you're a hard-core fan of any of the above.",1198368000,,6714,4.60233918128655
3278864,3,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth - The Golden Age"", the second part of a planned trilogy, features Cate Blanchett reprising her Academy Award nominated role from almost ten years ago. She is very good, she is always good, and one of three actresses I would watch read the phone book. The other two are Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. And Clive Owen is suitably dashing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but ""The Golden Age"" is lacking. In many ways.

In 1998, ""Elizabeth"" caused a sensation because Blanchett turns in an electrifying performance. Also, the film is stunningly gorgeous. And it continues our fascination with British royalty by depicting a small part of perhaps the most interesting monarch's reign. It was also our first visit to this oft-filmed monarch's life in a while, so it was interesting, refreshing and new to watch this director's and this actor's interpretation of the role. Since then, HBO produced a multi-part miniseries featuring Helen Mirren playing the same role. With more than six years between the two projects, we had enough time to give Mirren fresh eyes for her interpretation of the same monarch. The HBO project covers much of the same ground as 1998's ""Elizabeth"" but also goes further, to show her facing down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart, the Spanish king and more. Now less than two years after this memorable turn, we have ""The Golden Age"" featuring Blanchett playing Elizabeth as she faces down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart and the Spanish King's threats to invade England. Due to the proximity of the two films, ""The Golden Age"" draws unfavorable comparisons.

""The Golden Age"" seems `light' somehow. Like the force behind the story of the first film and the force of the production as a whole has been diluted. The film has more than one shot of Blanchett in an elaborate costume standing in the middle of a room as the camera circles her. This is interesting the first time, but when it happens a couple of times, it dilutes the power of this vision. We get it. Elizabeth has the weight of the country on her shoulders. And as queen, she gets to wear some amazing outfits. But when the shot is repeated, it seems designed to show off the costumes and appear to be filler rather than to help the story.

Blanchett is, as always, good. She is one of those actors who I think are incapable of giving a bad performance. Sure, they have appeared in bad films, but they are always interesting. As Elizabeth, she plays a character that seems tailor made for her, to accentuate the regal bearing of the actress. But in ""The Golden Age"", many of Elizabeth's best moments, her most powerful, were just portrayed by Mirren. Unfortunately, there are almost identical scenes and this really does ""The Golden Age"" and Blanchett a disservice.

Blanchett is a forceful personality and it is fun to watch her flirt and hold court. She really shows us many aspects of the monarch's character and life. But we don't get a feeling for the character's Virgin Queen status. Yes, we see her suitors and there are a couple of mentions made of this fact, the Queen's unmarried and unable to sire an heir, but it doesn't seem to be the pressing need we have come to believe. Too bad, because this is a fairly important part of her life. And it was a big part of Mirren's performance. Instead, ""The Golden Age"" concentrates on the impending conflict with the King of Spain.

Enter Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh. Upon his arrival at Elizabeth's court, he introduces himself and announces he has just returned from the New Land and named a colony Virginia, after the Queen. His gifts include potatoes and he brings two Native American Indians with him. But the impending threat of Spain changes Raleigh's actions; initially, he seems attracted to the Queen, and she him, but then his affections turn towards a younger member of the Queen's court, the Queen's most trusted friend.

As Spain prepares their armada for war, Raleigh jumps into action and begins to help the smaller British fleet defend England. As the Spanish ships attack, Owen swings from ship to ship, channeling the spirit of Errol Flynn. He even appears a little like the former swashbuckler film hero. The actor brings a dashing quality to the character, making him a bit of a rogue, a bit of a hero, a bit of the bad boy. It is no wonder the Queen falls for him.

Geoffrey Rush returns as Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's advisor. As he is sick throughout most of the film, he mostly stands by her side, raising his arched eyebrow when he doesn't agree or approve of something the monarch has said or done.

Rhys Ifans has a brief role as Robert Reston, a Catholic plotting to kill Protestant Elizabeth on behalf of the Catholic king of Spain. And Samantha Morton plays Mary Stuart, the woman at the center of many of Elizabeth's headaches.

""The Golden Age"" is beautiful to look at; the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to recreate the royal palaces and London of Elizabeth's age. The ships in the Spanish and British fleets are also particularly impressive. During the battle between the two fleets, we get a real sense for what life was like on these ships. Life and death.

But the film fails to fully engage us in the story. If you go to see this film, you probably have at least a rudimentary grasp of the history of these events. So the film should not have to work hard to engage us in the lives of Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh and the Queen's court. It should work hard to give us insight into the woman's life, the woman's thoughts, and the woman's feelings. But instead, it seems to want to focus more on the action-packed parts of the story, to make it more of an action film. It is almost seems like the filmmakers would like to recast Elizabeth in the mold of Sarah Connor, the role created by Linda Hamilton in ""The Terminator"" films. This doesn't work and detracts from the already interesting elements of the story.

""Elizabeth - The Golden Age"" is a bit of a wash. It features a strong performance from Cate Blanchett, a dashing performance from Clive Owen and looks beautiful, but it doesn't engage enough or give us enough insight into the monarch herself.",1198195200,,6158,4.692592592592592
3278865,3,B000ZOXDG4,"As I am a die hard fan of Kapur's Elizabeth, I was overjoyed when I found out that they were releasing a sequel, with both Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush returning. I made sure that I saw it on the date it came out, but I left the theatre feeling disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is an entertaining and visually lush film. The costumes are beautiful, the music is nice, and Blanchett (though looking a little young for a queen who should have been in her 50s), Rush, Clive Owen (as Walter Raleigh), and Samantha Morton (as Mary Queen of Scots) all give wonderful performances. However, it still felt as if the movie had something missing.

I know that the first Elizabeth was riddled with historical inaccuracies, but the movie contained so much plot and intrigue it allowed one to overlook its inconsistencies. Elizabeth: The Golden Age, however, falls short in that it focuses almost exclusively on the pseudo-romance between Elizabeth and Walter Raleigh (while Elizabeth did indeed have feelings for many of her male court favorites, Raleigh included, it was far from the fairy tale we see here) at the expense of leaving out many important characters and events. For example, where is Elizabeth's former love and best friend Robert Dudley? He is not even mentioned in this film, and it is a well known fact that not only did he participate in the Armada in 1588, he died later that same year, causing Elizabeth to stay shut in her room for days. Also missing is his stepson Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex, who was well on his way to becoming Elizabeth's golden boy.

Inaccuracies aside, there was so much going on in the actual time of Elizabeth I's second half of her reign (The Golden Age) that it is quite sad that all we get to see in this film consists of Elizabeth and Raleigh flirting, dancing, and riding around on horseback together or Elizabeth whispering her fears and desires to the only lady-in-waiting who seems to have been of any degree of importance, Bess Throckmorton (later Bess Raleigh).

The sad thing is, that with such talented actors, all this needed was a more fleshed out script and this could have come close to equalling its predecessor.",1198195200,,2204,4.731770833333333
3278866,2,B000ZOXDG4,"-
First of all, The story or History - well, I don't think the King Of Spain, Filipe II, wich was also, at the time, the King Of Portugal (the Portuguese throne gave him the command of the high seas - so, much of the ships were Portuguese caravelas), was only concerned with the Queen of England - it's ridiculous. And surely isn't as diabolical as showed. He made war against England not only because of the protestant position of Elizabeth BUT the fact that England's piracy were robbing ships and Spanish colonies with the Queen's consentment and not respecting the treaty causing economic conflict.

The only good thing in this movie is - as everyone knows - Cate Blanchet. Samantha Morton was also good in her role as Mary, Queen of Scots. I agree with most of the people. The first film was much better - the dialogues, intrigue, menace, all great, memorable sometimes. And with a grand finale! This movie, Elizabeth - The Golden Age lacks a good screenplay, intensity - Some lines are unbelievable dull. It looks like a soap-opera sometimes. Very bad supporting actors like the young Bess! Even Rush isn't as good as he was on the first chapter. But with such discrepancies it could have been a good film, but it fails mainly because of the heavy handed Kapur.

It's Hollywood-ized, down to the re-writing of history and the costumes, but it's still fun to watch.

3278868,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Occassionally a movie is made that makes you forget where you are for a couple of hours. This is one of them. It is impossible to watch this film and not be completely transported into her time.

Cate Blanchette was the perfect Elizabeth. She is regal and fierce in her role. She also shows the human side of Elizabeth and faces some of the same worries and circumstances that women in our age do such as wondering who she will marry and what is ethical. She had to make hard decisions that impacted all of England.

This movie gives you an historical perspective on the religious struggle in medieval Europe. Elizabeth leads her troops into war against King Phillip and beats him soundly, expertly avoiding an expanded Inquisition that was brutal and intolerant.

Of course there are many intense battle scenes as well as execution and torture. I had to cover my eyes. The cinematography was breath-taking and the costumes seem very authentic.

Elizabeth was made very human in this movie and is vivid unlike many written accounts of her life. This is a must-watch for anyone.",1197936000,,1077,4.74331550802139
3278869,4,B000ZOXDG4,"There were two tides of hype for this movie: it started off with the brilliance of Cate Blanchett reprising her old role that propel to international stardom, the next wave came when the movie was put down as badly executed production with brilliant subject (though some lack historic evidence) and an outstanding cast.

The Golden Age picked up where last time was left behind. Elizabeth is a loved queen who refused to punish the Catholics for their belief. However, Europe is still not ready for a Protestant bastard ruler in the area. So the Spanish plot of assassination and invasion rolled up. Elizabeth, apart from being threatened by the overseas forces is also going through her personal struggle - aging and not being able to love anymore (or show affection) as a virgin queen. The premise is great as it shows that we are treading into the premises of the fear of age while try to put yourself together publicly. However, this is also the premises that brought the less convincing Clive Owen and Abbie Cornish characters in. Elizabeth tried to feel what was like to be a woman again through them but only to find out that the same put her into more misery. The plot was a quite winding but very predictable. Also this time round Walsingham (Georffrey Rush) had family affairs to attend to - which was supposed to put some human touch in him - didn't work miracle either. So the subplots all became very loose as Elizabeth carried further burden of avoiding the movie to fall apart on top of her scripted threats.

Performance-wise, Cate Blanchett is brilliant as usual. However, she is now so good that unless she changed her identity to play Bob Dylan, it might not be able to secure her another Oscar. She could end up like Meryl Streep being nominated in whatever she does, but needs more luck to win as she is now being taken for granted as a great actress of our age. Never like Abbie Cornish. For her role, anyone can do it and I personally think that Scarlett Johansson will be able to put so much more depth into the character while radiating it with doses of sex appeal even when she is wrapped up like cake in her costume. For Clive Owen, he is good but not good enough to make his story line interesting. But he definitely has the power to shake Elizabeth to her core. Clive has that touch of openness that made his scenes with Cate so much more interesting. But all his other scenes with Abbie Cornish is just like ""ok we got it can we move on?""

Elizabeth: The Golden Age is not a bad movie, and especially after reading 6000 million bad reviews about it and then you watch it without expectation. But I think all the bad reviews didn't really do justice to the movie itself. Elizabeth was great and it was an unexpected runaway hit, so the stakes are high this time. If this is not a sequel, I think the critics will be much more lenient - well they are lenient enough to say Cate Blanchett is the only saving grace for the movie - instead of full scale bashing. So the best approach will be watch it as an individual movie and forget about the movie 9 years ago, then you will be able to enjoy it. But one thing that bugs me most are all those stills trying to tell you how much money they put into the costumes and sets. Come on, it's period piece they ARE suppose to look great, especially when you are talking about the court. And one last thing - yes you can compare the Cate 10 years ago with the present Cate as it has two split second flash back of the young Elizabeth from the 1998 movie.",1196467200,,3522,4.415384615384616
3278870,2,B000ZOXDG4,"First of all, The story or History - well, I don't think the King Of Spain, Filipe II, wich was also, at the time, the King Of Portugal (the Portuguese throne gave him the command of the high seas - so, much of the ships were Portuguese caravelas), was only concerned with the Queen of England - it's ridiculous. And surely isn't as diabolical as showed. He made war against England not only because of the protestant position of Elizabeth BUT the fact that England's piracy were robbing ships and Spanish colonies with the Queen's consentment and not respecting the treaty causing economic conflict. Plus, Filipe was one of the most intelligent men in the world and the most powerfull too.

3278871,1,B000ZOXDG4,"What can I say, the 1st Elizabeth was simply great, the kind of movie leaving you riveted to the edge of your seat!

Unfortunately this one is very much the complete opposite. So yes the costumes are great and the few CGI special effects (basically the couple of minutes of action featuring the ships of the spanish Great Armada) are well made.

But apart from that it's a 2 hours torture that could have easily been reduced to a half-hour. There's no rhythm, it's very very slow, with many supposedly 'key' scenes just  dragging on & on & on (e.g. the execution, the baby, the kiss, etc etc...). The trailer pretty much shows what's worth watching out of the 2 hours movie, how sad is that?

Kate Blanchett's acting is possibly the only positive note overall & Clive Owen is pathetic as usual (though his worst performance is still Children of Men). As for Geoffrey Rush I really like him but he doesn't have much to do in this movie.

In the end, you feel the director made an attempt to depict some kind of intimate portrayal of Elizabeth: her fears, her doubts, her loneliness... Fine, but then stick to making some BBC TV documentary. Because for a full-length cinema feature it's definitely not good enough! Kapur should have stuck to the winning formula that worked so well for the 1st movie: the intrigues, the twisted plots, the action...

The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!

To all those who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the Elizabeth: The Golden Age, prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church & their allies in the Spanish government had the armada succeeded in its mission.

If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of  the dictator Franco!!

Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line. Something this brilliant film makes crystal clear, regardless if Queen Elizabeth was no saint!",1193961600,,1559,4.961685823754789

On the home front, Elizabeth is being pressured to marry by her advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Rush).  She rejects many possible husbands, but finds some interest in Sir Walter Raleigh (Owen).

""The Golden Age"" is an entertaining but flawed movie.  On the positive side, it is great to look at.  The costumes, set design, and cinematography are gorgeous.  The acting, while not as standout as in the first movie, is still impressive, especially by Cate Blanchett.  On the negative side of things, the story isn't that exciting.  Historical fact is also compromised for cinematic value, but not much is added.  The war with Spain comes and goes quickly, and without much excitement.

3278874,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Following up 1998's Elizabeth, which documented the virgin queen's early years and rise to power, director Shekar Kapur delivers The Golden Age, an exploration of her character. While Elizabeth (Blanchett) is busy deflecting unsuitable suitors and falling for the dashing Walter Raleigh (Owen), imprisoned cousin Mary (Morton) plans her assassination with the backing of Spain's devout Catholic king, Phillip II (Jordi Molla), who has promised to rid England of Protestants. The first half of the film has a lot going for it: lavish, detailed and not as stiff as your usual period dramas, The Golden Age allows the love story to take precedence and the subtle wooing between the Queen and Raleigh boasts a few cracking put-downs. Blanchett, arguably the best actress of her generation, knows how to play Elizabeth and has fun with the character, while Owen et al just about match her. It's obvious that Kapur wanted to devote more time to the Spanish invasion, but time or money trimmed the battle back to such an extent that the grandiose Armada lacks any real significance - both visually and story-wise. A story of two halves, The Golden Age works better as a love story than a political conspiracy.",1193529600,,1202,5.015
3278875,5,B000ZOXDG4,"""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" entrances.  Presented at the Toronto Film Festival, Cate Blanchett is riveting.  The range of queen to a private woman with doubts & desires is exquisite.  Blanchett played in the 1998 film ""Elizabeth"" & was nominated for an Oscar.  She won Best Supporting Actress for ""The Aviator"" in 2004 and was nominated for ""Notes on a Scandal"" in 2006.  She centerpieces the film.

An array of excellent players includes Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh. Nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2004 for ""Closer,"" Owen flirtatiously woos Elizabeth.  Geoffrey Rush plays Sir Francis Walsingham who connives adeptly.  Rush won Best Actor for ""Shine"" in 1996, nominated again in 2000 for ""Quills.""

Australian beauty Abbie Cornish, memorable in ""Somersault"" and played in ""A Good Year"" with Russell Crowe, portrays Elizabeth's closest attendant, Bess Throckmorton.  With stunning good looks, she displays great range from the official to personal with Sir Walter to concern for her cousin.

Her cousin Francis Throckmorton is played by Steven Robertson.  In brief scenes, he is memorable, urging Bess to help him regain favor with the Queen and in torture as Rush's Walsingham wrenches information from him.  Robertson had a small role in Orlando Bloom's ""Kingdom of Heaven.""

Eddie Redmayne, who was Matt Damon's son in ""The Good Shepard,"" plays Thomas Babington who attempts to assassinate Elizabeth with an unloaded gun.  He's great face-to-face with Blanchett.

Samantha Morton has 5 films this year & plays Queen Mary Stewart of Scotland with regal bearing and the nervous repose of a political plotter.  I'll always recall her looking at Tom Cruise in ""Minority Report"" and shouting ""RUN!""

Shekhar Kapur directs as with the 1998 ""Elizabeth.""  He has since directed ""The Guru"" and ""The Four Feathers.""  Michael Hirst wrote the screenplay for the 1998 ""Elizabeth.""  He is joined by William Nicholson who has screenwriting Oscar nominations for ""Shadowlands"" (1993) & ""Gladiator"" (2000).

The wonderful cinematography from colorful pageantry to somber prisons is by Remi Adefarasin who shot the 1998 film plus Woody Allen's 2005 ""Match Point"" & Michael Apted's ""Amazing Grace.""

Also starring is costume designer Alexandra Byrne.  Her costumes are gorgeous & stunning.  Byrne's 3 Oscar nominations for costume design include Hamlet (96), Elizabeth (98) & ""Finding Neverland"" (04).  She costumed ""Sleuth"" with Michael Caine & Jude Law.

Elizabeth is a stunning film that sweeps us into the epic, keeps us entranced with a story that does not drag, is performed exquisitely & leaves an appreciation for this era.  Enjoy!",1193270400,,2632,5.322815533980583
3278876,2,B000ZOXDG4,"I wanted to love this movie.  It does fall a bit flat and stale when compared to the first Elizabeth and other costume movies.

The Plot - There is a plot but it is scattershot and a bit vague.

The Dialog - It is rather weak at many times during the movie. Much of the dialog is in the form of questions and sarcastic humor. That gets boring after the first 20 minutes of hearing it.

The costumes - They look amazing!

The cinimatography - Is a bit on the artsy side and is rather grainy at times.  It still managed to look appropriately stylish.

Obvious disappointments - The Queen was in armor but she looked so uncomfortable up on the horse.  I did not feel conviced that she was going to fight in the war and she didn't which I thought was going to happen. It would have been awesome to see the Queen sword fight even if it did NOT happen in reality.  It would have been entertaining.

The characters were very annoying especially the rogue man that Elizabeth had a crush on.  It was rather unbelievable that such a ""strong"" Queen would fall for such a low life loser.

Was Spain that threatening to Elizabeth and England? Well the director didn't convince me enough to dislike Spain.

The acting - It ranged from average to excellent.  Cate did her best with the stale script and probably insufficient directing.  The other female actress (blond younger lady) did a great job too.

I hope they make a third movie and do a much better job at forming a quality script.

Overall it seemed rushed and it was somewhat dull.
This movie was worth watching for the drama and neat costume design that it presented but I will not purchase this movie once it is released on DVD.

Comments on my review are welcomed. :)",1192838400,,1715,4.390476190476191
3278877,4,B000ZOXDG4,"The sets, the costumes, the sheer beauty of the landscape is enough to earn this film a 5 star rating.  Parts of this film were so gloriously done they inspired the awe I feel looking at an illuminated text with the gorgeous gold leaf border and kid smooth binding.

Cate Blancett was stellar as an aging Queen Elizabeth, coping with the decline of her fertility while she still had to play the game of trying to find a suitable man to sit beside her on the throne.  Her wit dealing with Sir Walter Raleigh had everyone in the theatre laughing at one particular line regarding Raleigh's proposed name for his colony.  Her quandary over dealing with Mary, Queen of Scots was touching--what should she have done with a kinswoman and Queen.  Her leadership during war was inspiring.

I do not have sufficient scholarship in English history to comment on the verity of the romantic storyline with Sir Walter Raleigh. The general accounts are true, whether they were over-stated for film purposes or not should be determined by someone with more knowledge than I.

I will say the film was very worth attending and I'm glad to have seen it full screen in a theatre.  While modern home technology does do a fine job of rendering films--there's nothing to compare with a large-scale screen for the more gorgeously filmed movies.

I'm predicting at least a nomination for Blancett as Elizabeth as well as for the costumers, set designers and cinematographers.  This may well be a movie to buy when it comes out--particularly if you have the capability to really showcase this gorgeous film.",1192579200,,1581,4.779411764705882
3278878,3,B000ZOXDG4,"***1/2

""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" picks up pretty much where 1998's ""Elizabeth"" left off.  The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England.  On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without.  The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth`s own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.

Whereas the first ""Elizabeth"" was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading).  Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time.  The scenes depicting this more or less ""platonic"" love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly.  Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping ""pirate,"" Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.

Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in ""The Golden Age.""  She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen.  In an obvious effort to make her more ""identifiable"" to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film.  This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, ""regular"" commoner.  The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham.

Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being.  For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative.  Lucky for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene (although I do wish that he had toned down the music a scosh).

The first ""Elizabeth"" was a genuinely great film; yet, while this second installment may not be quite as ""golden"" as either its title or its pedigree might suggest, it's still hard to resist the lure of that Elizabethan magic.",1192233600,,3664,5.08
3278879,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate Blanchett has outdone even her own self. She has mastered a role that many actresses have also played,but SHE has become Her Royal Majesty Elizabeth even more so in Shekhar Kapur's newest installment ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE than she was in the first ELIZABETH in 1998. Blanchett is the perfect combination of ice and fire,vulnerability and bullheadedness,sensitivity and rageaholic and masculine and feminine to bring England's savior to the screen. Ms. Blanchett is so in control of herself that the corset  stays tied, but the fear and passion always dwell just below the surface. She is Queen. At one point,Blanchett,in a rage at the Spanish Ambassador screams ""I have a hurricane within me""....and she does,because Blanchett does.
Blanchett may well see her first BEST ACRESS Oscar this year. She has a Golden Globe and another win would be no surprise. This film has many magnificent qualities going for it,but ultimately it is Cate Blanchett's astute and finely tuned skills as an actress par excellent that carry this film to victory.
The year is 1585. Spain is eying the English throne. Sequestered up in Fartheringay Castle in Scotland,Mary Stuart the Queen of Scotland (an amazing and convincing Samantha Morton performance as always) also has her own designs to usurp Elizabeth,""that bastard whore."" Elizabeth is still advised by her chief counselor Francis Walsingham (again Geoffrey Rush reprising his brilliant role from the original).Walsingham still has safeguarded England as a Protestant country. Philip of Spain and Mary Stuart, though, are Catholic, and are set to unseat Elizabeth as Queen. But another usurper enters early on;a usurper of the heart,Sir Walter Raleigh (a well made up and swashbuckled Clive Owen).What Kapur does so beautifully with all of these players is to reveal the immense struggle that existed for Elizabeth not only from without, but also within. As Queen she must rule and be obeyed; but she is also a woman who has a heart, and that heart has denied itself many  of life's pleasures in order that she may ""be married to England."" This is the single brilliance of Kapur's film;though he needs to fit in historical facts to tell the actions that  do indeed occur between the countries and their monarchs, Kapur always keeps his focus always on Elizabeth, the ruler AND the woman. Even as Elizabeth ""allows"" (somewhat)her chief lady,Bess, to be wooed by Raleigh that she states, ""live my adventures through you"" or when Elizabeth, clad in armour atop a white steed proclaims to her troops, ""We shall not be defeated. Whether in Heaven or on the field of battle,(that was a loose translation!) we shall return victorious"" ,our focus is always on this miraculously strong and clever woman whose reign brought prosperity to England that would last three centuries. Kapur is confident in his Queen ""Cate"" to deliver the goods...and she does. Kapur has his Elizabeth calmly slip her royal signet ring onto her finger and has her in an almost Moses-like stance facing the raging winds and the thunder and lightening as she surveys, in her night clothes, the fighting ships in the Channel. Here Elizabeth is the warrior and the woman in one...powerful and mighty to withstand the Spanish onslaught.
The battle between the British and the Spanish Armada off the white cliffs of Dover is awesome and powerful to behold. The Channel is ablaze with blasting canons and ""fire ships"".One scene that Kapur vividly implanted in my mind is that of a white mare jumping from one of the Spanish ships. Kapur's camera follows the horse from underneath,swimming in the fiery waters, while Roman crosses and goblets fall to the Channel floor along with the bodies of dead warriors. This is a very arresting piece of camera work and symbolism of the Spaniard's defeat from which they never recovered.
I would be remiss if I did not mention the totally engrossing soundtrack that propelled all of the action forward while never over-asserting itself. That is the hallmark of a fine soundtrack.
Did I love it? ABSOLUTELY.
Would I see it again? DEFINITELY.
Will I purchase the DVD? Yep (but it is awesome on a big screen and will be significantly diminished!)
Will Cate Blanchett get her first BEST ACTRESS Academy Award? So far,POSITIVELY.
What else makes this movie magnificent? Costumes,Sound,Cinematography,Original Screenplay,Editing,supporting actors.
Yeah...it was THAT good! As a sequel, it fulfilled all my hopes.",1192233600,,4449,5.108516483516484
3278880,4,B000ZOXDG4,"When we last left Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett), she was young and inexperienced, struggling to come to terms with ruling a country. We now rejoin her in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" which begins well into her reign; beginning in the year 1585, the film chronicles the growing tension between England and Spain and culminates with a fierce sea battle. It also examines the relationship between Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), an adventurous seafarer. What we're presented with is less of an actual account and more of a dramatic love story, which basically means that it isn't even close to being historically accurate. But I guess that isn't a bad thing, considering the film's more creative aspects--""The Golden Age"" is a triumph of set and costume design, and the performances are top notch.

If only the story were at the same level. It would be too much to say that the plot isn't interesting; rather, it isn't interesting enough. Much of the material plays like a run of the mill romance, regardless of the time period. I just know that so much more defined Queen Elizabeth I, and I wish the filmmakers had given her character a little more depth. Not that she's completely shallow--if anything, quite a lot weighs heavy on her mind, not the least of which is her conniving cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton). Most of their rivalry stems from different religious faiths: Elizabeth is Protestant while Mary is Catholic. Hoping to take control of the throne, Mary conspires to have Elizabeth assassinated. Intercepting on Elizabeth's behalf is Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), the Queen's most trusted advisor.

On Mary's side is Philip II (Jordi Moll), King of Spain, who believes that Elizabeth has turned England into a godless country. He intends to conquer the Queen by sending a mighty armada, and the Spanish Inquisition along with it. Elizabeth understands that England's resources are depleted, as is its money; a counterattack will be much harder to plan and execute. Despite being incredibly strong-willed, something is holding her back, something that's diminishing her confidence. She seems to rely on Raleigh to soothe her, despite not knowing who he is or where he came from. All we do know is that he's arrived home from the New World, where he named a colony in honor of the Virgin Queen (Virginia). We've seen many films that make the Mysterious Stranger engaging or downright sexy--indeed, Raleigh is dashing, flirtatious, and bold. Just watch the way he presents potatoes and tobacco to Elizabeth.

Hoping to win favor with the Queen, Raleigh gets close to her favorite Lady in Waiting, Bess (Abbie Cornish), and it becomes obvious that his affections are divided between these two women. This plot device could have been much more interesting had it not been so clich; I've seen romantic conflict before, and it's usually reserved for escapist films. But ""The Golden Age"" is historical in context. I wanted more focus on the impending Spanish attack, especially since it was so intertwined with Elizabeth's assassination plot. The final major sequence does feature some battle, but not enough to be satisfying. It's as if the film fizzles out after spending so much time building itself up. It's not entirely a letdown, but it is a disappointment. This is especially true of Elizabeth's pre-battle speech: clad in armor, she rides a horse in front of her army while spewing encouraging sayings. I half expected her to say that the enemy may take their lives, but they'd never take their freedom.

Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. I greatly enjoyed Blanchett's performance; she gave Elizabeth a determined yet fragile quality that was compelling. I distinctly remember an emotional outburst aimed at the Spanish ambassador: ""I too can command the wind, sir!"" she screams. ""I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!"" This moment was raw and overwhelming, which was appropriate given her emotional state. I also remember a scene in an astrologist's lair showing Elizabeth's desperation. She clearly couldn't stand not knowing how everything would turn out. It was prophesized that two kingdoms would battle and only one would fall--the Queen would like nothing more than to hear that England will be victorious. Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed.

Yes, there is a lot to recommend about ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" and thank goodness that the good outweighs the bad. This is not a perfect film, but it can still get an audience from point A to point B. And it certainly is wonderful to look at; every shot is so richly detailed that you can't help but admire the work that went into it. The costumes are vivid, colorful, and intricate. The sets are lavish and bold, with practically every location dripping with colorful tapestries. The armada attack features a number of convincing special effects. Basically, everything felt real in terms of the film's look. The film's story, on the other hand, wasn't all that it could have been. There's a wealth of material on Queen Elizabeth I, and I can't help but feel that most of it was disregarded to make room for romantic elements. Romance works, but only to a point.",1192147200,,5234,4.956719817767654

8236321,5,B000ZOXDG4,"Cate's great in this one. Again though revisionist take on history. I mean is accuracy boring or something ?!? Maybe it's just me but I find Non-fiction way more engrossing. Oh well, history is written by the victors & now theaters. Really, Raleigh jumping off a fire ship ?? YEA,Huh-huh. That job was given to ""expendable"" subordinates.  Coolest thing he ever did was yell ""strike man strike!"" at his execution.  Plus  Q.Elizabeth being able to see all the way to Calais from Dover or Folkestone to witness the armada burning (which only scattered their fleet while at anchor waiting for word from the Spanish army that was late.) You might see a faint glow on a clear night but not in a storm. O.K.,maybe I'm being too literal & poetic license is the theme of this movie. It was after all quite beautifully done. It's just the overt religious propaganda that irks a little.(& I'm not a religious person.) But more than that the total disregard of anything we really know about events & motivations is nothing more than opinion & fantasy & should be taken as such. This movie is romance novel & nothing more. Final note: England was instrumental in stopping the Inquisition which was kind'a like ancient Taliban so good show there.",1513987200,,1232,4.72093023255814
