Is the best...Honest...Informative and Real....The ladies interviewed were just what a group of students studying the subject needs to see....and for other transsexuals or transgendered these ladies give one hope and strength...

I just cannot write enough good about this dvd...Finally an honest portrayal...

8175374,4,B000N6UFAG,"Its sort of an inside view of a man transgender to female and finding out at age 41 he missed his male side of a life
he has taken to the exstream  of a woman's life, including prostitution, stripper and had over 30 surgery's.
I was left wondering how he could afford all this and why, one answer he said at the end was he couldn't tell
people he got involved with he was afraid they would think him queer so his relationships were doomed at the onset.
It was well worth the money to have it he was a beautiful woman.",1474416000,2,517,4.068627450980392

8175377,5,B000N6UFAG,"I can't say enough about this film.  To begin with, the DVD came in a slim case, which is great cause it allows for many more DVDs on my shelf.
The movie recounts reflections from several male-to female transsexual women, and also included one who reversed her surgery to return to being male.  All of the women had typical male adolescent years, but some knew as early as age 5 that they were female.  Most of the women felt that there was no logic to the way that they were, and reflected, if only briefly, on sex with men as a common theme.  All of the respondents felt that the transgendered lifestyle was a diverse spectral classification that represented all types of inclinations and diversions.  Some of what was stated in the movie is stereotypical and non-representative across the whole spectrum of TG/TS mentalities and lifestyles, but there was SOME truth in almost every word spoken.  With most of the women of the opinion that they spent their whole lives immersed in a secret gender, it's no wonder that they all struggled with gender harmony.  A central compelling theme was that gender identity does not equal sexual preference, an idea often blurred even by respected and educated people.  Intimacy really is about being yourself with someone, and that requires a type of honesty that may manifest itself as a gender identity disorder.
I was a little dismayed at the lack of ethnic variety in the documentary because a LOT of people think that transsexuals of color are all prostitutes and drug addicts.  Also disappointing was the lack of respondents who found themselves attracted to women.  As a black lesbian TS who likewise knew of her female nature at or before age 5, I think there are more TS women who prefer women than are obvious in almost any presentation.  Until the TS lifestyle can be studied up close and personally with honest, educated women represented among the respondents, a clear picture of MTF life and culture will not be available for scientific or social study or viable commentary.
(The above review was written by a TS friend of mine who viewed my copy of the film -- she said that she was glued to every word, and found herself crying because of the truths that were spoken.)",1291248000,4,2224,4.72093023255814
8175378,5,B000N6UFAG,"This is one of the most interesting documentaries I have ever seen if only for one reason:  the subject concerns older white men who felt the need to transition from male to female. Which is what I have just done.  It felt like these people were talking directly to me.  Their stories were so much like my own that I felt I was making new friends.  I was also intrigued that someone could transition, live as a woman for over twenty years, and then feel the need to go back.  My heart goes out to him.  A very interesting and well made film that touched me deeply.  If you want to know about the male-to-female transition experience, this is an excellent place to start.",1241222400,4,670,4.354838709677419
8175379,5,B000N6UFAG,"I basically purchased this documentary to hear about Judy/Josef's story since I had heard of his website 'HelpMeReverseMySexChange' some years ago and had wondered what became of him...and if he went back to living as a male again.  For me, personally, I wished more would have focused on her/his story (as well as, Brandy, another transsexual in the film) as the others were only interesting to listen to depending on how well you could relate to their stories (IMO).  Since I made the transition in my late teens I didn't totally relate to those who made the transition later in life after being married and having lived for years as heterosexual males (even Brandy seemed to show some skepticism or non-relate; which made me wonder if she was aware other transsexuals would participate in the doc, not just her and Judy).

Though remarkably, and perhaps courageously, a transexual named 'Beth' addressed being an 'autogynephile'  (something that is rarely openly discussed) when she mentioned masturbating in her sisters underwear as a young boy; that for her making the transition was more a sexual fetish.  I had never even heard of this 'condition' ten years ago.

This is just an observation I noticed is that nearly all late-transitioners (like many of those in this film) are Caucasian.  You rarely hear of a black transsexual who made the transition later in life.  My belief is because, as with very feminine males, life couldn't be any worse living as a female than it is as a male, so that gives them the courage and motivation to transition at an early age.  It seems to be mostly those who lived as white, heterosexual males that are hold-outs.  No doubt it's because their life is much better as white, hetero males than living as a female, so that would be my guess as to why they often wait so long before taking the leap.

I would highly recommend this documentary for anyone interested in the topic.",1230422400,6,1919,4.784848484848485
8175380,5,B000N6UFAG,"Very interesting. A unique DVD, I'd never seen anything like it. There are some great books showing up, but I haven't been able to find many movies. It was nice to see proof that people like me exist as well as a good representation of the variety of people that are Transgender.",1220400000,7,279,4.384615384615385
8175381,5,B000N6UFAG,"The film gives a good overview of the trans world. Just like in life there are down to earth folks but also, folks with lots of issues that have nothing to do with their sexual taste, and out right stereotypes. We can learn a lot from all of the individuals in the film. We can certainly walk away knowing that 'it' is as much a mystery to the transperson as it is to str8 people; or gays for that matter.

I thought the use of a transsexual's music in the film is a tribute to Tom Murry's ability to reach out to all communities.",1175990400,11,530,4.096153846153846
