2289303,5,B0009G4L50,"It's about time this sly, subversive sex farce -- high on the list of guilty pleasures for anyone fortunate enough to have seen it -- has finally reached the video market.  It deserves wide exposure (you should pardon the expression).  Screenwriter Mark Bruce Rosin's hilarious dialogue for his title character makes this a genuine camp classic.",1359849600,4,345,5.142857142857143
2289304,4,B0009G4L50,"This film is a one joke wonder... it is still very clever, and well worth having in a collection of novelty films",1355702400,3,113,4.181818181818182
2289305,5,B0009G4L50,been looking for this movie for a long time remember watching it at the theater and was hoping to see it on dvd or other format but could never find it so cool that i found it here,1350691200,2,180,3.763157894736842
2289306,4,B0009G4L50,"This is truly 'campy' movie that is in no way pornographic, though some might consider 'Virginia the talking Vagina' to be x rated or distastedul, it's a hilarious movie.  Imagine if our genitals could talk and had their own mind to say whatever they want, whenever they want.  As most adults know the thinking brain on our shoulders doesn't always match up with our sexual attraction down below.  When I saw this move back in the 70's it had been marked under the name, 'Don't date a girl with four lips.'  It took me a while to find it listed as ""Chatterbox.""  It was a bit absurd when I first saw it in the 70's as I was much younger, however as I've gotten older, I found the 'campiness' of it to be truly funny.  It's pretty funny when a talent agent calls a woman and then tells her to put ""Virginia"" on the phone and the woman slams the phone down bewteen her legs.  The only thing that I was left wondering about was the first scenes involved Virginia speaking out for the first time and giving her assessment of the mail partner's endowment or sexual ability, causing  him to recoil and break it off with the woman.  Then at the end of the movie, it appears the woman is ready to jump to her death because of the life that Virginia (the talking Vagina) has created for her and caused her many problems.  Suddenly on another cliff, another voice begins to sing.  It's the man from the first sexual scene, and apparently his penis is now singing.  They reunite and the movie suggests they live happily ever after.  My question was about that.  Did his penis learn to talk and sing while inside Virginia.  Was this some sort of contagious anomale that he got from her that caused his penis to talk and sing also, or was it there all along and just never spoke up before the incident.  But that's just the 1 minute ending.  The over all movie was hilarious.  If you're up for a great laugh and some extremely ridiculous scenarios, this is the movie for a great afternoon or evening at home.",1346889600,4,1995,4.375
2289307,5,B0009G4L50,great movie. been searching for this since i originally saw it on playboy channel in the 70's. very entertaining. and interesting.,1322438400,4,130,5.238095238095238
2289308,4,B0009G4L50,"CHATTERBOX with Candace Rialson was a campy/nudie romp...that worked. A cult classic in the genre of ""ROCKY HORROR without the toast.""
There's a lot of cute innuendo and faux modesty sections...and the story line even led to a COOL sequel opportunity.
So, put the kids to bed [as per DR. RUTH] and enjoy an ADULT COMEDY..some off-color jokes will SNATCH a laugh ot two out of you...
I had an old CED format [remember those?] copy...and could actually read the car license plate as ""I 69 WET.""
There, ...you're warned...If you are into VIOLENCE, and ACTION...keep way way clear. If your up for a light-hearted sex-farce...this is right up your alley.",1229472000,6,649,4.8558558558558556
2289309,4,B0009G4L50,I saw this on vhs years and years ago. I thought it was entertaining and very well done. It easily transcended its schlock genre and Candice Rialson is a gem. Whoever did the voice of her puss was a scream.,1208908800,3,206,4.175
2289310,2,B0009G4L50,"Hollywood tomatoes cavorting with Rip Taylor and Professor Irwin Corey (taking time off from accepting awards for Thomas Pynchon) so you've got shtick up the wazoo. This film isn't so much a cinematic capturing of the swinging 60s as it is a record of the death of burlesque. It reminded me of The Buggles ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" and The Simpsons episode ""Bart After Dark"" (featuring a tribute to Sheckey Greene), where the consequences of Venus never becoming Hera because of Ortho are spelled out with Marilyn impersonators and double entendres flying. The only things missing was a bump and grind score, a light up bow tie, and a punchline rim shot from a bored drummer.",1170892800,2,679,4.811965811965812
8060219,1,B0009G4L50,"It's a bootleg copied DVD. The audio is terrible and so is the picture qaulity.
Very, very bad product. Only giving 1 star because I have to give at least 1 star.

8060225,3,B0009G4L50,"Penny Pittman (Candice Rialson) has a Virginia that not only talks but sings. It doesn't like Penny's boyfriend Ted (Perry Bullington) and tells him very bluntly. Virginia would prefer a basketball team. Penny is exploited and goes on stage and sings. No sense in examining the medical condition.

Yes, it was an interesting concept, and was done in a campy manner so as to hit on all the overly apparent jokes. In many scenes the microphone can be seen, sometimes from the top and other times from the bottom. Cult-trash cinema

The film includes Rip Taylor, Arlene Martel (Spock's Vulcan wife ""T'Pring"" AMOK TIME), Professor Irwin Corey, Sandra Gould (Gladys Kravitz)

The film has sex and nudity (Candice Rialson).",1442188800,,717,5.008403361344538

8060228,4,B0009G4L50,"After seeing a few Candice Rialson movies on DVD (Candy Stripe Nurses, Summer School Teachers, and Hollywood Boulevard) I really wanted to see her in something after Hollywood Boulevard. Candice really stepped up to the plate on that film (standing strong with Paul Bartel, Mary Woronov, and Dick Miller) in her ""acting"". So I took the risk in purchasing the movie she did in 1977 called Chatterbox. What a surprise comedy this is from one time gay porn director Tom DeSimone (Lancer Brooks to his gay fans) who would later bring us mainstream fans Reform School Girls and Hell Night. This movie is definitely drive-in fare from 1977 for its low quality.
The movie is burned onto DVD-R and looks pretty decent. Doesn't look like it was from videotape (like my copy of Summer School Teachers) because the image would be smeared more than it is. I was surprised to see this look as good as it does. There is even a main menu! Don't get that from videotape recordings. This is bare bones release of this 73 minute full frame movie (count how many times you see the boom mic, one time it almost hits an actress in the head!).
This is a hilarious movie about a woman with a talking vagina and hope one day a company will give this a legit release. I would love to see Shout Factory release this with Hollywood Boulevard, Summer School Teachers, and Mama's Dirty Girls. These four films with Candice Rialson would make a nice package.",1372550400,4,1428,4.603921568627451
