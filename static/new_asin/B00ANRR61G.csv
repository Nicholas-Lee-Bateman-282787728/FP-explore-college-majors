8554847,5,B00ANRR61G,"On this DVD, he goes into great detail explaining what a cash flow statement is and the difference between it and the income statement. He also talks about the difference between accrual accounting and cash accounting and why publicly traded companies have to use accrual accounting. He explains in detail how to look at a company's finances and if you want to know more, he even recommends books that you can read.",1356998400,,415,4.777777777777778
8554848,5,B00ANRR61G,This video does a very good job of explaining the cash flow statement. I would say it is probably one of the best explanations of all. One of the reasons for why it is good is because he is using video which allows him to jump back and forth from one financial statement to another showing you how the things that are included in the cash flow statement really came from the income statement or the balance sheet after certain adjustments. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone interested in learning accounting and more specifically learning the cash flow statement.,1355702400,,577,4.7227722772277225
8554849,5,B00ANRR61G,"I always found the cash flow statement to be the most challenging to understand, and I would assume that it would also be the most difficult to explain. I was therefore thrilled to watch this DVD as the way it is explained on this video was superb.  Mariusz didn't just discuss individual line items but he showed exactly why they appear on the cash flow statement. I really like how he shows how the cash flow statement is derived from the other two statements. Overall, very good video!",1355443200,,488,4.545454545454546
