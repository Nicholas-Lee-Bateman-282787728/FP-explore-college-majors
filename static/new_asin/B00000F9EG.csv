7908044,4,B00000F9EG,"Gene Autry plays himself as foreman of a cattle ranch in this engaging modern B western faced with a problem as the new owner of the ranch, Sandra Knight (Polly Rowles), a recent college graduate in animal husbandry who decides to move from the East to her inherited property, brings with her a flock of sheep that she has been gulled into purchasing by an unscrupulous local rancher. Sandra also brings three of her lady college classmates with her to vacation during the summer on her new spread and their attempts to adjust to Western life provides comic effects thanks to a well-written script and the very competent direction of Joe Kane, who always works well with his cast, in this instance abetted by the presence of three veteran cowboy villains: Al Bridge, Edward Hearn and George Chesebro. There is plenty of good riding and roping, notably by Autry upon his splendid jumper, Champion, and the action is fast-paced with an interesting plot, comedic interludes and the customary musical numbers by Gene, who takes a properly strong stance against destructive sheep grazing in this delightful low budget effort, marked by the normal rushed ending when production money is depleted.",1128643200,,1190,4.984924623115578
