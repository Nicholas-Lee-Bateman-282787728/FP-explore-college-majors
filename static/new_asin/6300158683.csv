219445,5,6300158683,"From the director of ""All's Quiet on the Western Front"" comes this little-seen classic version of W. Somerset Maughm's story.  A very early talkie, this movie features a young Joan Crawford in the role of  Sadie Thompson, a fun-loving floozie who becomes the target of Christian  reformers. Crawford (in pre-ham acting mode) is very good as Sadie, as is  John Huston as the reformer Davidson.  It is very old fashioned but  Milestone's direction sets it apart from many talkies of the day.  He  utilized motion camerashots, the actors move around naturally, not tied to  the close range of a hidden microphone in an obvious prop. Therefore, movie  is not as stilted and static like many of it's contemporaries.  Extra  mention should be made for the Roan group who have done an superb job of  restoration, and yet do not charge exorbitant prices.

This is a review of the Roan Group version of Rain (1932).  This DVD will provide the best picture and sound quality out of all the different DVD releases of this public domain movie over the years.  The Roan Group restored the movie from the original 35 mm negatives and other original materials.  The picture and sound quality easily tops any other DVD release of this movie, I assure you.

Rain (1932) stars Joan Crawford and Walter Huston. Crawford, under contract with MGM at the time, was out on loan to United Artists to make Rain after the huge success of Grand Hotel (1932). The kind of role Crawford plays in Rain is unlike any of her usual roles she had played up to that point. She usually played heroic roles and shop girl roles. Now she was playing the role of a sinner, a loose woman, a hooker named Sadie Thompson. Audiences at the time couldn't accept Crawford playing such a role, so this movie flopped at the box office. Time has given this movie a huge boost, as modern day audiences accept this movie and Crawford's performance much more easily. Crawford herself didn't like this movie, probably because it bombed. She said that she overacted. I do agree that she did overact in some parts, but Crawford gives a great performance. A different role, yes. But her acting works so well for her character. Crawford looks the part as well, and her entrance in the movie is legendary. This movie is a good example of an actress showing her versatility, but unfortunately the subject matter of the movie and perhaps some tunnel vision by people at the time is what made this a flop in 1932. It's amazing how audiences can't accept an actor playing a different kind of role than what they're accustomed to.

One of the things I like about this movie is the atmosphere. It's a rather dark movie and it rains a lot throughout, hence the title ""Rain"".  I also like the way a lot of the scenes were shot and some of the camera angles.  The shots of the sky at various times throughout the movie really add to the dark feel and atmosphere.  The movie seems ahead of its time.

In my opinion, Rain is one of Crawford's best movies from the 1930s and it's certainly in my top two or three Crawford movies from the 1930s. I think the movie holds up pretty well. I highly recommend it.",1425081600,9,2398,4.491954022988506

I won't delve into the story of the film as it has been summarized quite succinctly in other reviews here. I'm focusing on the quality of the print, for a Public Domain film that has been released in many shoddy versions over the years. This version from Roan is probably the cleanest print available of this much maligned film. Many thought Crawford's performance almost clown-like at the time of release but it seems quite genuine when seen through the lens of time. Perhaps - along with being out of copyright - this is why the film has suffered from some ""TLC"" when it comes to restoration/preservation. The opening credits show some wear & tear (As they do on almost any film over 80 years old) but the main portion of the film is surprisingly clean and clear. Sound is quite acceptable for the era and the contrast levels are pleasantly distinguishable. There are no extras of any sort on this dvd, but as an admitted ""Crawford collector,"" this is the version to own until a true FULL restoration comes down the pike.",1390953600,6,1126,4.691919191919192

I determined this film to be theee most nail biter, edge of your seat morality play that I have yet to witness all my years... The pre-code days allowed a slice of reality much more so than the banal predictable moral codes of today...

Even considering today's headlines and ""Elmer Gantry"" like replicas, there is no triumph of hiprocisy featured so prominently as one encounters in this enticing film... Joan never looked sexier, and that is given her performance in Grand Hotel... The reformed makeup-less look was much less flattering but we girls all know how humidity never tames the locks to our desire...

I ended up rooting for Sailor O'Hara to sock it to the acerbic and disdainful reverend, but the ending proved even more rewarding! I can imagine why this must have resonated so well with audiences in the Theatre who were repressed from the 18th Amendment and saw this as sweet revenge with the impressive ratings...

219540,5,6300158683,"The story of a bad girl tempting the missionary, man of the cloth, symbol of all that is good and Sadie Thompson is all that is evil.
I thought Joan was quite effective since she always comes off as a bit course to me in all of her films anyway.
Her early scenes with the soldiers on shipboard and then at Guy Kibbee's General Store were probably risqu for the early 30's and I wondered how they were able to get around the code of decency though by today's standards there is nothing to these scenes.
I am a big fan of Walter Huston and Beulah Bondi which made this film all the more enjoyable for me.

219541,4,6300158683,"When Joan Crawford makes her entrance in this film, you know that she isn't going to be reading the Bible any time soon.

Away from MGM, she sinks her teeth into the role of Sadie Thompson and she's great as the amoral woman out for a good time (with a few good men).

By 1932 the movie-going public was well aware of who Joan Crawford was: the flapper, the mischevious gal with a heart of gold, the wronged woman, the clotheshorse.

She is none of these things here, and that is why the movie got such a bad reception upon release: glamorous Joan was nowhere to be found.  By 1932 Crawford was already highly regarded as something of a clotheshorse and (dare I say it) dancer (yikes!) but those films made money.  Here is Joan in her first truly magnifcent acting role and she is taking no prisoners.

Her entrance - this hand, that hand, that foot (leg), this foot (leg) and then the shot of her face.  Magnificent!  The only other memorable (female) entrance in a film was shot 14 years later by Lana Turner in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"".  People hate my reviews, so I know that others will certainly disagree with me.  (Hedy Lamarr in ""White Cargo"" seems to be chump change compared to this).

Lewis Milestone directs this and his stagey camera instructions can be forgiven as it is 1932 and the camera really hasn't learned how to ""move"" yet.  It can get claustrophobic at times.

But Crawford gives a great performance (even better than in ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Possessed [1931], or ""Paid"".

It's a shame that the public took her to task in her first great film role.",1372118400,,1575,4.5

219543,5,6300158683,"""Rain"" is based on a short story by W. Sommerset Maugham. A very young and lovely Joan Crawford gives a wonderful performance as a former prostitute on the lamb. You see little of the later persona she created for herself here but she was perfectly suited to the part. She meets a powerful and opinionated preacher and his prudish wife on the island of Pago Pago in the Rainy season and by means of what most of which seems much like cruelty tries to convert her to his own religious beliefs and the consequences of that belief to her personal life. Other travelers also add to the plot with their observances and opinions of the relationship between ""Sadie"" (the prostitute) and the Preacher. I won't tell the story and ruin it for you but there's a lot more going on in this drama. The ending is profound indeed but the real story is found in the dialog and the actions, thoughts and feelings of the characters. A true piece of classic storytelling. The role of ""Sadie"" was also played prior to this version by the beautiful Gloria Swanson in ""Sadie Thompson"" but the Joan Crawford version really holds up even now. A remake of this would be wonderful if someone would do it. I love this book and for Joan Crawford fans this movie is a must. Well worth the price. You'll want to watch it over and over and you'll notice something new each time. I recorded the audio book version of  ""Rain""

The movie begins with clouds and rain. There is singing from a group of soldiers. They want cigarettes. Does it ever stop raining? People present their passports for inspection. The ship is quarantined because one sailor has cholera (a dangerous disease still). One important visitor is a reformer to inspect the island. Then we see ""Red"" smoking a cigarette. ""Hello, soldier!"" Sadie wants a cheap hotel room (to keep expenses down). The natives enjoy life, eating and singing. [Unlike the rest of the world?] Sadie doesn't need glasses, she drinks out of the bottle. Drinking and dancing on the Sabbath? How scandalous! [Are the people overdressed for the heat?] Mr. Davidson stares at Sadie. Will there be trouble? Davidson complains to the Governor. The ladies complain about Sadie's presence. Is the ""right thing"" a matter of opinion? Will Davidson try to save Miss Thompson?

They converse, and Sadie tells about her past. Can she atone for her past life? Salvation or destruction? Is she doomed? Sergeant O'Hara visits her again (he too is from Kansas). Why doesn't Sadie want to go back to the States or Honolulu? What about Sidney? What if the Governor orders her off the island? Davidson used his connections to force the Governor's hand. Can Sadie get a few days delay? She tells why she doesn't want to return to San Francisco: there is a charge against her. Atonement for her sins? Sadie prays with Davidson. Then Sgt. O'Hara shows up with a plan for Sadie's escape. But Sadie must accept her punishment, guilty or innocent, because Davidson says so. ""I'll never forget you, ever."" Everything is clear to Sadie now. The drumming suggests the natives are restless. Sadie and Davidson talk about the future. What will Davidson do now? The next day brings sunshine. The fisherman find a body in the sea. ""I wonder why he did it?"" Sadie plays music again. Why? She feels like her old self, and will now go to Sidney.

You have to surmise why Davidson did what he did. Punishment for his sins? [Is this story believable?] Was it meant as a parable about society? Did Davidson represent the failure of Prohibition? I never read the short story that was used for this movie, I suspect it also aged badly. Joan Crawford became a star, her name was at the bottom of the cast listing.

Joan Crawford was absolutely devastatingly beautiful in this picture, and her acting was firstrate. The fear in Sadie was so believable; and the anger that Sadie had towards the hypocrisy of the missionaries was purely evident. This is without a doubt Joan's best picture of the 30's.

219652,5,6300158683,"Rain is an excellent Joan Crawford film that features fine acting by the cast; the cinematography and the choreography work well, too. This may have been a flop at the box office back in 1932; but I can see why this movie made it to DVD--it's actually quite a good film.

The action begins when passengers on a boat are unexpectedly stuck on Pago Pago in the South Pacific after an outbreak of cholera. And there couldn't be two more opposite people amongst those passengers--Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford), a loose woman, and a remarkably charismatic and somewhat nutty missionary named Alfred Davidson (Walter Huston). It isn't long before Sadie and the Marines on Pago Pago get friendly; and Alfred Davidson and his wife (Beulah Bondi) just can't stand it any longer. The Davidsons feel strongly that Sadie is a terrible sinner who must immediately repent for being loose, drinking liquor and dressing too ""loudly.""

Sadie resists Mr. Davidson's attempts to ""reform"" her; and the most of the others at the hotel where they're staying generally support Sadie to one degree or another. They do come to fear the political connections Davidson has; and when Davidson complains to the Governor of Pago Pago, Sadie just might be in a whole lot of hot water that even her Marine boyfriend can't help!

Joan Crawford is to be commended for a stunning performance as Sadie Thompson. The transformation of Sadie about one hour into the movie is astounding. Sadie is no longer a loose woman but instead she is now dressed very differently; she even completely agrees with the missionary Alfred Davidson that she must return to San Francisco to repent for her ""sins.""

Why does Sadie not really want to go back to San Francisco? Will Sadie's Marine boyfriend ever hold off Davidson, or will Davidson win the tug of war over Sadie's future? What makes Sadie change--and will it last? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie and find out!

The DVD has no extras; but the movie held my attention so well it almost doesn't need any extras. The rain that almost constantly pours down on Pago Pago enhances the drama of the story in a good way, too.

Overall, Joan Crawford fans will love this film. Rain is an excellent example of Joan giving an outstanding performance. Look for Walter Huston to give a stunning performance as the missionary Alfred Davidson; and Guy Kibbee fits in well as the owner of the hotel where the action takers place.",1207699200,13,2456,4.794326241134752

At first, Sadie has no intention of leaving and becomes incredibly indignant. Sadie says, ""you take care of your evil, and I'll take care of mine..."" -- words to live by.

A jewel bedecked, heavily made up Joan Crawford plays prostitute Sadie Thompson in this version.  She arrives in Pago Pago after having fled Honolulu's red light district.  She along with other passengers on the arriving ship are quarantined there due to a cholera outbreak.  Walter Huston playing fanatic reverend Alfred Davidson, his wife and daughter are also stranded.

There are all put up in the general store by kindly shopkeep Joe Horn played by Guy Kibbee.  Crawford begins to become friendly with the military men stationed there with special attention paid to Sgt. O'Hara played by William Gargan.  The naive O'Hara professes his love for Sadie and wishes to marry her.  Huston, egged on by his devoutly religious family, becomes enraged with Crawford's lusty behavior.  His mission becomes her salvation from wickedness.  He gradually wears her resistance down comvincing the governor of the island to deport her back to San Francisco.  With O'Hara sent to the brig for a week Huston turns Crawford into a repentant and brainwashed shell of what she once was.

The night before Crawford was to depart Huston succumbs to her charms and rapes her.  The hypocritical Huston eschews his beliefs and commits suicide.  The overwrought episode restores Crawford back to normalcy, for her, and she intends to run off with O'Hara.

Director Lewis Milestone is to be commended for some really fantastic camera work.  The opening scene showing the onset of the rainy season in Pago Pago was cinematically stunning.

219693,4,6300158683,"'Rain' appeared at a point in Crawford's career where she'd have done anything, played anyone - even Wally Beerey's grandmother, or so the saying goes - for a good part. And along comes Sadie Thompson, Prostitute of the South Seas, the Original Good Time Had By All, and off Joan went, to revel in a meaty role made famous by contemporary theatrical actress Tallulah Bankhead.

Panned by an unimaginative set of critics, and reviled by a public used to seeing La Carwford as the Ingenue shopgirl in such fluff as 'Our Dancing Daughters' and 'West Point', it's really a testament to the fickleness of the moviegoing public that this, a movie of really sterling performances and interesting, almost experimental direction, could have been so overlooked.

Joan plays Sadie, a hooker on the run, who is forced into an island-wide quarantine after her connecting boat ride is infected with cholera. Among the other passengers so stuck is Rev. Davidson (Walter Huston), who, upon discovering Sadie's sluttish past, becomes hell-bent on 'saving' her soul.

Joan gives an honest and raw performance here, and does not try to glamorise or romanticise the heroine. Hers is a bitter and hard-edged Sadie, full of bile towards men and the establishment, yet tender and vulnerable when the role demands. Her range as an actress is showcased here in the excellent exchanges with Rev. Devine, and Walter Huston responds in kind with a terrific rendition of the sanctimonious, dictatorial Man of the Cloth.

Direction by Lewis Milestone is highly remarkable for the period, the stacatto rainfall and panoramic camera sweeps contrast beautifully with the enclosed, claustrophobic interiors of the General Store, and the poverty and primitive status of the isalnd community shines through, lending a feeling of wilderness to the piece.

All in all, this is an excellent picture, and one of Crawford's finest performances. It's no Mildred Pierce, but where that movie falls down in terms of unbelievable glamour, this one excels - the realism is relatively palpable.

Thoroughly recommended.",1105660800,11,2072,5.188622754491018

  Rain is a movie that was produced in 1932, prior to the Hayes Production code that radically changed Hollywood when it took effect in 1934.  The movie, which was filmed on Santa Catalina Island, deals with passengers from a steamer that are quarantined for cholera on the South Seas island of Pago Pago.  The passengers, consisting of the Reverend Alfred Davis (Huston), his wife (Bondi), their adult daughter, and prostitute Sadie Thompson (Crawford), take up rooms at the island's general store that is owned and run by Joe Horn (Kibbee).  The steamer's arrival is proceeded by the onset of the rainy season.

  The free spirited Sadie Thompson has just left Honolulu's red light district en route to the South Seas.  She takes a room downstairs in the store and quickly sets up shop with some local Marines to the immediate consternation of the Rev. Davidson and his family.  No one else, including Mr. Horn and Dr. MacPhail seem to care.  Sadie and her guests first draw the attention of Mrs. Davidson and her daughter by playing records and dancing on the Sabbath.  Mr. Davidson (Huston in a powerful, creepy performance) soon takes it upon himself to ""save"" Sadie and thus change her lifestyle.  The minister uses the power of his stateside organization to pressure the local administration to aid him in his quest.  Through his efforts Sgt. O'Hara, who is in love with and wants to marry Sadie, is thrown in the Brig and the other soldiers discouraged from visiting the store.  Davidson also talks the island's governor into deporting Sadie back to San Francisco (from which she fled to avoid being arrested for an unspecified crime).  The storeowner Horn, while sympathetic to Sadie's plight, is forced to put up with the annoying tirades of the Davidson's because he fears losing his reputation and business if he doesn't.  He continually cautions Sadie to beware of Davidson and the power that he wields.  Dr. MacPhail meanwhile, manages to remain nuetral, although it seems that he too finds the Davidson's overbearing and Sadie victimized.

  Eventually Davidson manages to brainwash Sadie into changing her ways and being saved.  She soon agrees to be sent back to the States and face her prison sentence (even though she indicates that she was framed).  Before she can leave though, Davidson (who is not as morally pure as he would let on) gives in to temptation and rapes her, breaking the spell of the brainwashing and leading to a suprise finale.

  This movie was poorly received by the movie going public in 1932, but has come into its own since then.  The movie's message is all the more powerful today given the recent resurgance of conservative religious extremism to the political mainstream.  The Davidson's prudish ways and their desire to enforce them upon the rest of the world are nauseating.  Sadie, while far from a moral angel, is a fun loving, happy go-lucky person who is satisfied to live her life as she pleases without interfering with anyone elses right to do the same.  Her life is nearly ruined by the Davidson's moral crusade.

  Apparently Milestone didn't want Crawford (who was on loan to him from MGM) to play Sadie, however she more than handles the part.  The movie itself takes place almost entirely on the first floor of Horn's general store during a continuous rainstorm.  This limited setting is carried out by good camera movement and better acting.  The screenplay was based on a story by W. Somerset Maugham.  All of the actors give good performances and the script is very good.

  The DVD itself (the copy I viewed was from Alpha Video)was a good and very viewable transfer with no extras and good cover art.  It was very worth the price and is especially recommended for persons interested in pre-code Hollywood or those who want to see some of the dangers posed by religious extremism.",1102550400,8,4150,4.876436781609195

""Rain"" is fine today as a vintage relic of adult filmmaking. It concerns a group of missionaries who land on the tropical isle of Pago Pago during rainy season to save the souls of the ""sinful"" natives who are otherwise living in blissful harmony. Unfortunately, a group of Marines gets stranded there as well and among them is the colorful Sadie Thompson (Crawford), a woman of easy virtue and proud of it. The Marines love her and she parties hardy with them much to the shock and chagrin of the missionaries--- particularly the Reverends' self righteous wife (Beulah Bondi). She complains loudly and the Reverend determines to cast out the ""evil"" from Sadies' soul even though Sadie is just fine with it the way it is. Their confrontations eventually lead to a near exorcism of Sadie and she succumbs to the Reverends' power. But the rain doesn't let up and the jungle drums keep pounding in the night. The Reverend succumbs to a power of a different kind---that of the unleashing of long pent up sexual frustration and he rapes Sadie thus sealing his own fate as the real ""lost soul"". Walter Huston is stagily effective as the pompous Reverend and Crawford is nothing short of magnetic as Sadie.

Remember that in this period, the camera was usually stationary due to limitations in equipment, both for the camera and the sound recording.

219761,4,6300158683,"Joan Crawford is cast as Sadie Thompson and Walter Huston as the preacher in this 1932 version of the Somerset Maugham classic.  Shot in black and white, the video and soundtrack are somewhat scratchy, but the quality of the screenplay and the performances shine through.  The mood of the film is dark and shadowy throughout, and the Pacific island seems hot, wet and  foreboding.  Even the opening shot of soldiers marching in the rain and singing a song about how they expected a paradise when they signed up but were now disillusioned, sets the tone for the piece.
I never realized how attractive Joan Crawford was in her early days and this role calls for her to play both the hard edged prostitute as well as the newly converted former sinner. Both these personas come across loud and clear.  Walter Huston plays the preacher role sincerely, as a true believer who wants to save Sadie's soul.  Later, we see his inner conflict by just the look on his face, as his eyes glisten and he turns towards the closed door of her room.  There are a lot of shadows and a lot of close-ups and a lot of long, lingering looks between the actors.  This all works as a film and even though I knew the story, I felt the tension and conflict clearly.
The only music was the ragtime of Sadie's phonograph, the Polynesian melodies of the natives and - towards the very end - an instrumental rendition of ""St. Louis Woman"".  Also, given the technological restrictions of the time, there were some wonderful shots of the hard rain and rain barrels.  Everything looked wet and hot and sultry.  It was really very well done.

219762,4,6300158683,"This 1932 vintage film has a young and sultry Joan Crawford in the role of South Seas siren Sadie Thompson. Walter Huston is compelling as the fire and brimstone preacher who wants to run this fallen woman out of town on a rail. Beulah Bondi is excellent as the preacher's prudish wife whose sensibilities are upset by Sadie Thompson's very presence in the small, cramped South Seas island hotel where they are all staying, awaiting a ship that is to take them to their final destination. Seeking to save Sadie's soul, the preacher manages to brow beat Sadie into repentant submission to his will, only to be done in at the last by his own answer to the call of the wild.

This is an interesting film that shows the idiosyncrasies of earlier talkies. Look for some odd camera shots used in order to segue into the next scene. Listen to the pounding of the torrential rain that can be heard almost throughout the entire film (hence, its name). Listen to the beat of the native drums, working to set a mood when necessary. All in all, a very well done film for its time. Joan Crawford fans will love it, as will all lovers of vintage films.",1007856000,5,1138,4.471153846153846
219763,4,6300158683,"A fun and fascinating adaptation of Maugham's novel. To create the steamy Pago Pago atmosphere, the entire crew went west of Hollywood! (it was actually filmed on Catalina Island). Crawford never approved of her interpretation of Sadie Thompson, batting at the ball after Jeanne Eagels, Blanche Sweet and Gloria Swanson took their turns swinging the bat and hit. Joan was insecure especially since she was told ""When Jeanne Eagels died, RAIN died with her"". Strangely enough, her performance, when seen today is definitely one of the more interesting of her incredible career which spanned from 1925-1970. Audiences (mostly women) in 1932 flocked to watch Joan suffer in mink; they couldn't or wouldn't accept her as this blatant trollop of the South Seas! While her wardrobe for the tarnished lady is somewhat bizarre, her acting is certainly more watchable in this film than those in which she passed herself off as a zombie in the forties and fifties (with exceptions of A WOMAN'S FACE, HUMORESQUE, POSSESSED, etc ), Crawford was rather limited and wooden in her acting technique; it was her spunky flair and undeniable beauty with which her fans identified (even her ""sister"" Bette Davis admitted ""Boy, did that dame have a FACE""! But Davis had acting talent which Crawford could only sigh at with envy!",996537600,5,1307,5.055555555555555
219764,5,6300158683,"When I bought my first VCR back in the mid-1980s, the first commercial tape I purchased was a cheapie of ""Rain.""  I knew nothing about the story line and not much more about Joan Crawford other than ""Mildred Pierce"" and how she had been portrayed in ""Mommie Dearest.""  While the tape was only of medium quality (I would later buy both better and worse from the same company), it was good enough to enthrall me with the film.
""Rain"" tells one of those timeless stories that still has a lot to say to audiences today:  missionary succeeds in reforming sinful woman but then succumbs to her charms.  It had already been filmed as a silent with Gloria Swanson and would later be made into a color film with songs starring Rita Hayworth.  Jules Massenet's opera ""Thais"" has a very similar plot line.
Joan Crawford made this film at a time when she was mainly playing ambitious shopgirls clawing their way to the top.  ""Rain,"" for which MGM loaned her out after her big success with ""Grand Hotel,"" was a very different kettle of fish than her usual 1930s heroine and gives her a chance to really stretch herself.
Made up more than Gloria Swanson or Rita Hayworth ever thought of being, Joan's performance is similarly over-the-top but fascinating.  Our first view of her begins preparing us for her portrayal:  the camera first shows, one at a time, her two jewelry-bedecked wrists, then her two high-heeled-shod feet, and then finally her face, cigarette dangling from her mouth, and we have no doubt as to the kind of woman we are looking at.  And to hear her as she speaks her first word, ""Boys,"" is to understand why she thought her voice had been dubbed in by a man the first time she heard herself in a talkie test.
Sadie is vulnerable almost from her first appearance onscreen, asking for a room in the little hotel in Pago Pago because she has no money, and explaining, Flaemmchen-like, that she doesn't eat very much.  And William Gargan as O'Hara, the innocent young sailor who is smitten with her from the first time he sees her, recognizes her sweet, gentle quality, calling her a ""lady,"" much to the delight of his friends.  And Joan's softer side responds to his innocent quality, as she chooses O'Hara (whom she calls ""Handsome"") over the other men.
Walter Huston, the Reverend Mr. Davidson, is Sadie's nemesis.  His role is a little more one-dimensional, but he plays the cold, unflinching and ultimately all-too-human preacher very convincingly.  He does manage to garner at least some sympathy, both because of his suicide and especially as compared to his extremely self-righteous wife, played by Beulah Bondi (when I first saw Beulah Bondi's sympathetic portrayal of James Stewart's mother in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" I had a difficult time believing such polar opposites could be played by the same actress).
The turning point in the film is Sadie's conversion from sinner to penitent, and here it falls a little bit short.  But this is a fault of the script itself rather than the actors:  Sadie's actual conversion happens with very little motivation, so it is difficult to take seriously.  But even if Joan is not up to the challenge of making Sadie's conversion believable (I don't know that anybody else would be, either), she more than compensates for it when she tells O'Hara how she doesn't know why she chosen to be saved, she only knows she was.  This for me is the single most memorable moment of the film.  And she is equally great when she says, after learning of Davidson's death, ""now I can forgive him"" (shades of Puccini's Tosca).
Much has been made of director Lewis Milestone's camera tricks, but what I really love about his direction is how he introduces any number of interesting little contrasts and parallels.  For example, while the Christians read the Bible, pray, and yet display no sympathy for the plight of others, Guy Kibbee, as the sympathetic proprietor of the hotel who has helped Sadie when she had no place to stay, reads writings by the atheist Nietzsche.  And while our first view of Sadie is by way of her wrists and feet, our last view of Davidson is by way of his feet, washing up onshore after he has remorsefully cut his throat.
The quality of this DVD reflects a marked improvement over the VHS tape I have owned for years, with strong contrasts in shading between light and dark.  There is very little on the DVD in the way of extra features:  separate listings of the cast and credits, and that's about it.
""Rain"" remains to this day one of my favorite movies.  And I give it five stars because of the story line, still relevant almost 70 years later, the wonderful portrayal by Crawford, ably assisted by a srong supporting cast, and the greatly improved technical quality of the film.",985564800,31,4747,4.699638118214716
219765,5,6300158683,"The only problem that I had with this documentary is that it wasn't long enough. I must confess I never expected to see such grace in a female boxer. Funny and undaunted we are given a brief glimpse of her rise toward her Middle Weight World Championship title. Guidi herself is charming and insightful in the most unexpected ways but what is most startling is how well-adjusted everyone around her is represented. Her family is sweet and supportive but hardly bland. I'm not sure if we only got a look at Guidi's good side, even so she comes off as a helluva boxer and a fascinating human being.",984096000,,596,4.527777777777778
219766,4,6300158683,"I remember seeing this at Theater 80 St. Marks expecting that it would be a ""camp""-y good time.  I was genuinely surprised at how good it was.  Crawford is wonderful as the tough-talking tramp who is ""saved"" by the Reverend.  She is great at projecting the vulnerability inside Sadie before and during her conversion to penitent, and how, despite her lack of faith in humanity being being well-placed. that that vulnerability remains after her conversion back to tramp.  A great performance that was considered a flop in 1932 (Critics at the time said the role was all but beyond her) that works far better today.  It also give you a whiff of the raw sexuality that Crawford exuded in her early movies that made her the Madonna of her day.  Very much worth seeing.",981676800,4,764,4.664179104477612
219767,4,6300158683,"""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson,  a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a  bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of  the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also  exceptionally elegant.
The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset  Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the  part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and  powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old.  It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around  longer than we think.
I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no  other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her  famous.",963705600,10,954,4.721212121212122
219768,5,6300158683,"Strange little film...  A bit stagey perhaps, but I don't consider that much of a criticism, and actually there are some particularly ""cinematic"" touches for an early talkie --- lots of odd camera  movements.  It does feel a little claustrophobic, but this is pretty  essential to the plot; the entire movie takes place in a tiny hotel, it  rains throughout, and Sadie is trapped in a variety of ways, both  emotionally and physically.  I must disagree with the couple of people who  claim this is an example of Joan Crawford not hamming it up. She is awfully  charming in this but definitely doesn't give a performance I would describe  as understated.  In fact, I would say that what gives this film its  peculiar charm is a combination of its staginess, claustrophobia, and  Crawford's appropriate-seeming hamminess.  It's interesting to compare this  with the equally enjoyable Raoul Walsh/Gloria Swanson film, ""Sadie  Thompson"".  They are EXTREMEly similar, but ""Sadie  Thompson"" makes no reference to the play ""Rain"" in its  credits --- only the Maugham story.  Wonder when the play came out....",955324800,5,1101,5.078651685393258
