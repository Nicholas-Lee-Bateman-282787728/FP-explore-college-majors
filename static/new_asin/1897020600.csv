202515,1,1897020600,"In reviewing this video, I found the people were ready to laugh before he even walked out.  I find humor in so much in life and I was amazed that I did not find him funny at all!  In fact he is the most un-funny person I have ever seen performing comedy.  Anyone can mock others, most can do it in an amusing  manner and without arogancy.  Don't waste a dime on this guy.  Jeff Allen is a better bet any day.  Sorry to leave such a review.",1221868800,3,439,3.9204545454545454

202518,4,1897020600,"I'd not heard of Tim Hawkins until last night at some friends' house. They played the Full Range of Motion video. I had intended to stay for 10-15 minutes but stayed for the entire show.

His routines are quite imaginative and totally 'clean'. His take offs on songs are hilarious, especially his worship songs sponsored by corporations...""My Ford is an Awesome Ford..."", etc.

I'm not sure my parents in their 80s would appreciate him as he's pretty off-the-wall but younger adults and kids would love him.

202519,5,1897020600,We have been watching the ad shows on the Worship channel and we all roll with laughter watching Tim Hawkins.  He is equal to Brian Regan in our books.

He is one of the best comedians I've ever heard (Christian or non-Christian).  He is hilarious.  He proves that you don't need to curse and talk dirty to be funny.

202574,5,1897020600,"I will be the first one to say take God & your relationship with him seriously, but also respect the goofballs that He created!  God is the author of joy & Tim is gifted in helping to find joy in the tedious & crazy things of life.  I do believe that laughter is good for the bones & healing for the body - thank you Tim for shining in this arena.  Some may think Tim is a bit twisted, but if we're honest so are each & every one of us, to various degree's.  I don't (can't) run from this fact or try to hide it (doesn't actually work) so I am grateful for this ""twisted"", enormously funny guy that loves God & spoofs on songs & other crazy stuff we face & makes it easier to laugh a long the way!  My husband & I both especially enjoy the marriage segments as the years have taught us to laugh at ourselves & our flaws & yes, even at each other.  Each of us are works in progress & no matter how much we'd like to fast forward through the yucky stuff, it just doesn't work that way.  I'm so glad that God's not finished with this work yet & for the goofballs that He created!
FYI - I am more ""preachy"" than Tim - if you didn't know he does a lot of Bible study work off stage then you probably won't glean that from watching him.  He is just a normal guy having fun on stage & invites us along for the laughs.",1363305600,2,1310,3.9169811320754717

202587,5,1897020600,"After a YouTube introduction to Tim Hawkins I decided to buy his DVD Full Range of Motion. This is Tim's first DVD release of his stage show (apart from the Banana'DVD). I have to agree with some reviewers that some of the material is just Ahha funny but other bits are just hilarious. Taking into account this was his first DVD release I don't think it is as bad as some reviewers make this out to be.

Tim Hawkins humour is not your normal run-of-the-mill type humour. I would describe his humour as Far Side styled. In a nutshell, yes Tim is funny and you will  find plenty of laughs on this DVD. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates humour ranging from one liners, to witty, to yes - even toilet humor. I also like the way he pokes fun at Christians (I guess he can do that since he is one).

Like Tim says, Come on folks, if you can't laugh at yourself, laugh at others.

I definitely recommend this DVD",1349308800,3,920,4.2701149425287355

202593,2,1897020600,"...this particular DVD was really lacking...
I've loved Tim Hawkins since viewing a YouTube clip of him 2yrs ago, and just this past summer my husband and I went to see him perform. We purchased a pack of 'goodies' at the concert which included ""Cletus Take the Wheel"" CD, and DVDs (Insanitized, I'm No Rockstar, Rock Show Comedy Tour, and Full Range of Motion). We listened to the ""Cletus"" CD on the way home and were howling! We watched the first 3 DVDs and, even though some of the materials were repeated, we still cracked up every time. We finally watched the Full Range DVD the other week and, boy... what a disappointment. We still had a couple of chuckles, but he really seems ""off his game"" on this one. One reviewer said he seemed like he was slow, his timing was off. I was thinking ""Wow, he must be going through some personal struggles"" because he just wasn't ""with it"" in this DVD. I purchased this and I'm No Rockstar as a Christmas gift for a friend *before* I watched this one, and now I wish I'd chosen a different one.
If you are going to purchase his DVDs, this one really isn't one you need in your Tim Hawkins collection. The other 3 DVDs I listed are great, and the songs on the Cletus cd are also super funny.",1325116800,3,1233,4.341991341991342

I have watched this 3-4 times with different friends and still start laughing out loud each time.  There are parts--where there is more physical humor that aren't quite as funny to me, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  My parents in their 60s laughed and thought it was funny, but probably won't watch it again because they weren't into the physical humor as much. My kids (3,6,8) were able to get many of the jokes and 3 years later still sing some of the jingles.  It was good family fun and fully worth the money.",1311379200,2,621,4.327586206896552

I thought it was ok, but kind of slow and not nearly as good as Rockstar.  Hawkins seems slower, like his timing is off or something.

I prefer witty comedy, and some of his jokes are witty or even insightful. Other parts are just silly; those weren't even funny to me.

The good parts, though, were really good.",1271462400,4,345,4.548387096774194

If you need a good comedy DVD for a group meeting, date night or family get together, I HIGHLY recommend this one. He's great. We also purchased his other DVDs but this one is BY FAR the best. Gave it to several friends for Christmas and everyone has the same reaction. Hope to catch his next event soon. My 4 and 6 year olds can sing the Subway song all the way through.

202623,4,1897020600,"I had my doubts that I would like this guy's comedy. I usually can't stand ""Christian"" anything, even though it's the team I play for. I want quality, not evangelical Christian PC.

This show is laugh out loud funny the whole way. You don't have to be a Christian to appreciate most of his schtick, although you might get lost toward the end when he ""reimagines"" familiar (and tired, old) praise songs. He riffs on parenting, kids, shopping, traveling... universal human experiences that resonate with a broad audience.

The best part of Christian comedy is that it's funny without veering into crass or offensive territory. I think comedians have to work harder for their laughs if they aren't using that crutch. For a sample of his humor, check it out on youtube, especially the clip titled ""I'm Not a Rock Star.""

I probably would have given this DVD five stars if I had watched it maybe a half hour at a time, instead of all the way through. The comedy becomes a little repetitive at this length. And, I'm not one to appreciate humor about bodily functions, so some of the jokes didn't appeal to me. But I'm sure they would to my 10-year-old!",1241136000,22,1146,4.607843137254902
