8755809,1,B01DEV5D1C,Waste of my time. I still don't know the story or the point of the movie. Did not grab my attention. Although watching aditya roy was great. He's such a hottie. I don't care for Katrina. I personally don't like her acting.,1486684800,,222,4.309523809523809
8755810,5,B01DEV5D1C,Love this movie. Would buy it again for sure. You should totally watch this because of  Aditya and the soundtrack.,1480982400,,114,4.7
8755811,4,B01DEV5D1C,"Beautifully shot, poetic movie about obsession.  Aditya plays this obsession beautifully and believably.",1470960000,,104,7.0
8755812,4,B01DEV5D1C,"This movie is a retooling of Great Expectations.  It has been done in modern times with Gwyneth Paltrow and Ethan Hawke.  Well this modern version is set in India.  It's well done as well.  It was a little convoluted at times and the plot became a little confusing  but overall, it's a good movie.",1469923200,2,297,4.425925925925926
8755813,3,B01DEV5D1C,"Aditya Roy is pure eye candy. It's supposedly an Indian version of Dickens GREAT EXPECTATIONS...however it adds a sortve Bollywood twist within the plot regarding the familial relations of ""Miss Haversham""  that I couldn't quite discern despite multiple viewings. Some sort of step father ?  a bit long despite lush cinematography and there's no dance and music scenes to speak of. Bollywood attempts Russian depression?",1469059200,,420,5.446153846153846
8755814,3,B01DEV5D1C,"Overall, I liked the movie.  The story was based on Dickens so it was much stronger than one of India's famous ""make the plot up as you go"" films.  Aditya Roy Kapoor and Tabu make this movie worth watching.  However, again, Katrina Kaif leaves me wondering why she's even in a movie let alone starring in one.  Her performance is weak, and sometimes, it's almost painful to watch her.",1466812800,,384,4.521739130434782
8755815,4,B01DEV5D1C,"I want to stream this, gave it 4 stars since it probably is 4 stars, love Aditya Roy & Katrina also...., but came to stream it so am leaving a note, please put more movies on stream. thank you",1465603200,3,192,3.948717948717949
8755816,5,B01DEV5D1C,"In my opinion, there is much to like in this movie, like the beautiful backdrop of Kashmir and Lake Dal, the story, the music and esp. the dance sequence by Aditya Roy Kapoor and Katrina Kaif. A must see and own.",1464480000,6,212,4.195121951219512
