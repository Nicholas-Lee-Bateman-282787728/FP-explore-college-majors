Also discussed are the different styles of thinking and doing embodied in different individuals and the different roles that these individual types must play at different points in the journey to concrete reality.  Bootstrap Bootcamp (B/B) offers what is essentially a simple but universal ""map"" by which to navigate entrepreneurial terrain.  Since every entrepreneur faces a unique landscape, B/B provides specific examples to assist in locating the critical registration points.

Although principally prepared with business entrepreneurship in mind, this ""map,"" since it taps universal principals, can be useful for finding one's way in many other processes and relationships.

B/B opened my eyes, not only to new possibilities, but to fixes dearly needed in a current endeavor.",1200528000,,923,5.757352941176471
2941467,4,B000VHSPF4,"The Bootstrap Bootcamp DVD serves as a timeless tool in every fresh or seasoned entrepreneur's tool-box through their own journey of dreaming, building and growing companies from scratch.

Most Business books and schools teach you what to do once you HAVE a company. This DVD begins with how to make sense of your thoughts at every step from the moment you ""think"" of starting your own company. The concepts of explaining the journey of building a company A-Z, are simple to follow and very logical once you hear it, see it and practice it.

Highlighted elements such as ""talking to the customer"" even before you take your product to market, ""re-bootstrapping"" your company after years of growth and practicing the art of constant innovation have been defined in clear steps with real-life examples to prove the fact that this thought process works!",1200528000,,849,4.971830985915493
8218622,1,B000VHSPF4,"WORST ADVICE AND DVD I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY LIFE!!  Do not waste your money on this DVD!!!

My dad bought this DVD for me as a X-mas gift.  I watched it with my wife and am infuriated that my dad got scammed into buying this DVD.  My wife went to Haas Business school at UC Berkeley and thought this DVD was absolutely ridiculous and laughed the entire time (this is not a comedy!).  I thought it was terrible as well, not professional, he talks so much WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL!!

One final thought.  When people usually talk in front of a green screen, they have another background, not just a green screen!!

TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY!!  It's just his friends commenting on it saying it's the greatest!!  All from Austin, TX!!!",1307232000,,736,4.466165413533835
8218623,5,B000VHSPF4,"Bijoy is singularly passionate about Bootstrapping. He's taken a challenging method of starting a business and broken it down into simple ideas that can be acted upon. Many people bootstrap their businesses but few can tell you the steps they followed, how they navigated their way through the maze or how they arrived at the decisions they made. Bijoy has taken a theory and provided a primer that will allow an entrepreneur to map their way through the maze and successfully bootstrap their business.",1204502400,,502,4.988095238095238

8218625,5,B000VHSPF4,"The vast majority of Great companies (Dell, Microsoft, etc.) were all bootstrapped, but it's an incredibly hard model to articulate.  Bijoy has not only articulated it, but he's organized it to share with the world and help other entrepreneurs launch their business in a way that really contributes to their community and society.",1203638400,,330,5.226415094339623
8218626,5,B000VHSPF4,"As someone who has attended and listened to many of Mr. Goswami's rantings on the bootstrap model and process, I found that the DVD very nicely organized and summarized the stages and concepts of ""bootstrapping""  He uses several graphics throughout to help explain the process as well.  As someone who is engaging in starting a new company, I find the bootrapping model a refreshing contrarian viewpoint to the traditional business school models.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone involved in any stage of organically growing a company.",1201910400,,541,5.125
8218627,5,B000VHSPF4,"Bijoy's video is one of the best working models I have seen in quite sometime.  I have been a believer in his methods for the last few years.  I encourage anyone who is interested in starting down the path to spend sometime with Bijoy and his work.

Demo-Sell-Build repeat...pretty easy to follow once you understand the method.  Bootstrapping your organization, in my humble opinion, is a sound path for any business venture.  If you choose to go the way of the VC there are still some very important messages here.  I would recommend at least listening to the method before you decide as it might help make the decision more sound for you.

For anyone who is already down the path this information will serve to guide you no matter which stage you currently find yourself.",1201737600,,774,4.647058823529412
8218628,5,B000VHSPF4,"It turns out I was the classic bootstrapper without even knowing it... when I found out about Bijoy's work I realized, in hindsight, that there was indeed a method to my madness.  Using his clear terminology and simple conceptual framework, I've been able to wrap a real language around my business decisions and evaluate things based on his golden ""right action--right time"" approach.  Not to give away the surprise ending or anything.  Highly recommended for people in search of their own entrepreneurial path... those that wish to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.",1201564800,,577,5.117021276595745
8218629,5,B000VHSPF4,"As someone who started my own company I often feel like I am navigating my way through thick fog. I found this to be a very useful framework, offering a language and a model that gives me perspective.
I highly recommend that any entrepreneur absorb these concepts. It will help with both your business and personal growth.  I even introduced this to my leadership team and they have found it valuable as well.",1201219200,,409,4.602739726027397
8218630,5,B000VHSPF4,"Bijoy does a tremendous job of pulling together complex bits of data and presenting them in a usable model for entrepreneurs to make sense of chaos.  The problem of prioritizing and making tradeoffs in a small business are instrumental in navigating the waters from ideation through commercial success.  The Boostrap Bootcamp DVD is a quick study to help owners and managers in early stage startup and growth companies align their company with the framework presented and then ensure they are doing the right things at the right time.  And conversely, not wasting precious cycles on things that shouldn't matter.  Bijoy presents some bedrock tenets that we should all take to heart as we navigate ideating, building and growing a company.",1201219200,,738,5.125
8218631,5,B000VHSPF4,"I found this to be an extremely informative and useful tool for understanding how great ideas can become a reality. It is an easily understood, step-by-step guide to building a business and taking the right actions at the right time. It has inspired me to re-evaluate my current strategy and look to see if there is a more innovative way to approach my business.

It has also opened my eyes to the different people required to build a business. I was able to recognize my strengths and determine what type of partner would take my business to the next level.  Bijoy is brilliant and the tools found in the Bootstrap Bootcamp DVD are easy for anyone to apply to any business at any level.",1200700800,,687,4.532258064516129
