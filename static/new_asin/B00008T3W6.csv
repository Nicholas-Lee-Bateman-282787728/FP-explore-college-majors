1862222,4,B00008T3W6,"I remember this movie when I was a kid and wanted my daughter to watch it too. It was a silly as I remembered it. It is not the best movie ever made or best care bare movie, but it was good for a laugh. The best parts are with Grumpy and all the hats. If you can find a copy watch it. It is fun to share some of my childhood memories with my daughter",1215648000,,350,3.6184210526315788
1862223,5,B00008T3W6,"This is one of my favorite care bear movies but I don't understand why it hasn't been put on out dvd yet. I love the songs, the story was solid, and the cheshire cat was awesome. If Nelvana still has the rights to the movie, why is it the only one that isn't out on dvd yet?",1215216000,3,274,3.824561403508772
1862224,5,B00008T3W6,"I loved this movie as a kid and when I went to look for my old copy it was gone- sad day!  I wanted to show it to my daughter who has recently become interested in movies like this, so I came searching for the DVD- don't you think the fact that people are selling the VHS for $40 should show the producers that this movie NEEDS to come out on DVD!",1202428800,4,347,3.8194444444444446
1862225,5,B00008T3W6,"OK so I HAVE grown up and no longer really pay much attention to the Care Bears--but as a kid I LOVED this particualr movie, which is as yet the only full length feature film starring the 'bears that has not been put out on DVD in the USA, while several other countries DO have it available in that format.  I never forgot this particualr film and though it isn't as popular as the other movies, I have to say I feel it is better than any of the rest, and I can hardly remember it, but there are certain unforgettable moments that I will never forget, such as the song mentioned in the other review, the evil wizard's song, the jabberwocky scene,  and the young girl getting the unicorn to drink from her hand.  This film is awesome.  Coming from someone who is grown up but never could get this movie out of her head.  Highly Recommended.",1189382400,3,839,4.284810126582278
1862226,5,B00008T3W6,"I loved this movie as a kid. The songs are great, especially the Cheshire Cat's song and ""I'm Mad About Hats"" by the Mad Hatter. I never got bored with this movie. I remember watching it at least once a week when I was a child and more like every other day during summer. I still love it now and would love to have it on DVD.",1183161600,7,325,3.8656716417910446
7986864,5,B00008T3W6,"By far the best Care Bear story.  It is the most unique, imaginative, and just plane entertaining movie in a long history of warm, fuzzy, feel good films.  I will never forget the ""Mad About Hats"" song, and I just might sell my soul to get this on dvd.  As it stands, the only way to watch it with my kids is Youtube.",1463616000,,317,4.0
7986865,5,B00008T3W6,I wish this movie would come back on a dvd and not so expensive. I love this movie as a kid. Wish all the old movies up to now are on dvd. So many classics this age haven't seen. Please try to get this on dvd. Thanks,1451952000,,216,3.617021276595745

7986868,5,B00008T3W6,This was one of my favorite movies growing up. The message was solid and an important one and the songs were fun and cute. I wish this was out in DVD format for Region 1. :(,1380326400,,173,3.8333333333333335
7986869,5,B00008T3W6,"I never have this movie on VHS. But, I watched it on YouTube last year. It's wonderful. I too want The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland as much as some of you do. I'm aware that it only been released on DVD in various countries, but not here in the U.S. and Canada. Now, this is for the Care Bears fans, if you want a DVD copy of the movie, I have a Petition on Change. Org. The only thing you gotta do is to sign. I feared that some of you may not be able to find it, so here's the link: [...]",1372464000,,496,3.7788461538461537
7986870,5,B00008T3W6,"I took my three daughters to see this movie when it was in theaters. I purchased it on VHS when it was first released. I now have two granddaughters and my VHS copy is wearing out. Please give a heads-up when it's released on DVD or Blu-Ray! ""Stay off the checkerboard!""",1364774400,,270,4.313725490196078

7986872,4,B00008T3W6,Excellent! For any of those that remember this movie from the 80's. Classic Care Bears. Video was in great condition. Came quickly. Was packaged in a plastic case in a cardboard box. Greatly protected.,1355270400,,201,4.9411764705882355
7986873,5,B00008T3W6,"I grew-up with this as my favorite Care Bears movie and have lost my vhs copy.  My son (who is two) ADORES the original care bears movies and we would be thrilled to have this movie, but who can afford $50 or more for an old most likely previously viewed tape that is not going to withstand the kind of viewing my son will put it through?  It would be a great idea for whatever company that owns the rights to this movie release it on DVD.  I'd buy two copies in fact, because that's how I anticipate how often we'll watch it! DVD PLEASE!!!! I'm desperate for something for my son to watch other than what he's been watching (he only likes care bears these days)!!",1216944000,6,664,4.21259842519685
