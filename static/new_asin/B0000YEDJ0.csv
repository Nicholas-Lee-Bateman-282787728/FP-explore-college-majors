8004514,4,B0000YEDJ0,"This is the second part of a two-part series which dates from 1999. Again we have soprano Ljuba Kazarnovskaya and her interesting hair and makeup offering introductions to clips of Russian opera singers excerpted from operatic productions on film and television films, some in concert. Bass Ivan Petrov is also featured talking about many of the singers, and for a couple introductions Met opera coach Joan Dornemann turns up as well. If you want to hear full versions of anything you're out of luck; in most cases we get snippets rather than full arias or songs. For example, Kazarnovskaya's concluding segment from a stage performance of Strauss's ""Salome"" picks up the end of the Dance of the Seven Veils and segues to a small portion of the concluding monolog. Olga Borodina's ""Una voce poco fa"" showcases her in what looks to be a villa from some Black Sea resort area, which I guess qualifies the clip as an early music video.
When I first found out about this miniseries I was much more interested in part 1 and I still believe that to be the more valuable of the two, but I am very glad to have the clips of Vishnevskaya as Aida (apparently one of the only surviving records of her on film after her image was purged following her defection from the USSR) and of Italian supertenor Mario Del Monaco chewing scenery with mezzo Irina Arkhipova during his guest appearances at the Bolshoi in Bizet's ""Carmen.""
When this program appeared in the late 1990s there were not a lot of home video options for the opera fan to see as well as hear singers; nowadays you can probably call up fuller versions of most of the arias here on Youtube. It's well worth repeated viewings if you can find an inexpensive copy.",1308009600,2,1711,4.631578947368421
