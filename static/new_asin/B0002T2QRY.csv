2118310,5,B0002T2QRY,"I grew up watching Bob Hope Christmas specials, so this was a great way to step back in time.  It is classic Bob, and the guest list is incredible - Bing, Lucy, John Wayne, Jack Benny, and many others.  Wonderful family entertainment for the holidays!",1099094400,36,251,4.555555555555555
2118311,4,B0002T2QRY,"I'm a big traditionalist, especially when it comes to the holiday season.  For years it was always a great tradition to watch the Bob Hope Christmas special.  Each year he'd introduce the All-American football team filled with corny jokes, and sing his usual Christmas standard, ""Silver Bells"".

Hope for the Holidays is A walk down yuletide memory lane with this delightful look back at Bob Hope's NBC Christmas specials from yesteryear. Along with tree trimming, sleigh riding and egg nogging, the Bob Hope Christmas Special was an annual holiday tradition for families across America for 40 years. In this landmark collection, Bob and Dolores Hope welcome family and friends into their home for a nostalgic look at some of the funniest moments from past holiday specials and USO tours.

Authorized by Hope Enterprises, this DVD contains rare holiday bloopers from the Hopes' personal collection. The feature includes appearances by John Wayne, Red Skelton, Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, Phil Silvers, Dyan Cannon, Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, Dixie Carter, Olivia Newton-John, Shirley Jones, Lee Marvin, Redd Foxx, Phyllis Diller, Marie Osmond, Bing Crosby, and many more. There's 100 minutes of holiday cheer on this release!

We don't have Bob around anymore but he can live on in this collection.",1098230400,125,1298,5.251207729468599

2118317,5,B0002T2QRY,"My wife and I love ""Christmas movies"" and classic ""Christmas specials,"" but shopping for classic TV specials is a tricky matter. There's a standard list of ""old Christmas episodes"" that seems to be recycled through various DVD companies and sets. The other problem is that some we've bought turn out to be duds: Someone got access to a grainy old bit of video and slapped it on a disk.

That's why I'm taking time to recommend this DVD. Obviously, it's aimed at people who remember Bob Hope and enjoy his style of humor. As a Baby Boomer, I realize that Hope has been eclipsed by contemporary comics and generally is remembered as a guy who seemed to support the war in Vietnam. I would point out that Woody Allen personally cites Hope as a comic genius whose classic performances influenced Woody himself.

If you're someone with a warm spot for Hope, then you will smile during segments of this DVD. It's an odd mish-mash of a late-in-life TV special Bob and his wife made supposedly filmed ""in the Hope home"" with various celebrities stopping by. What's great about this disk is that the visitors trigger ""flashbacks"" in which classic scenes are shown from earlier in Hope's TV career.

We always know, when ordering such disks, that we might wind up with something we already own or, sometimes, we risk getting junk. We watched through about a dozen disks this Christmas of classic material -- and this is the one we're choosing to rate with 5 stars.

Hope fans? This one is a gem.",1484956800,6,1485,4.634980988593156

2118327,4,B0002T2QRY,"Bob Hope: Hope For the Holidays is a nostalgic look at the annual Christmas shows presented by comedian Bob Hope, whose connection to Christmas TV specials began on Christmas Eve 1950 with The Comedy Hour. These NBC specials became eagerly anticipated staples of holiday viewing each year. Bob, his wife, Dolores, and their family invited friends from the worlds of entertainment and sports to celebrate and reminisce about vintage seasonal sketches in the 1993 special Bob Hopes Bag Full of Christmas Memories.

Highlights of this release include a compilation of his monologues from his many holiday tours for the USO, Redd Foxx and Hope playing reindeer reluctant to guide Santas sleigh, Hope and Red Skelton (as Freddie the Freeloader) experiencing a small Christmas miracle, Jack Benny visiting Santa at the North Pole for a holiday stickup, former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt delivering a Christmas message, and Naomi and Wynonna Judd singing Beautiful Star of Bethlehem.

Department store Santas Bob and Robert Cummings swap stories on the subway, opera star Lily Pons performs a selection from Lakme, and Bob and Dolores Hope sing Silver Bells over a montage of him performing the song with an array of female costars from 17 holiday specials.

Bonus material on the DVD release includes Shanks for the Memory, about the world of golf according to Bob Hope, which contains clips of Hope with Bing Crosby, President Gerald Ford, and pro golfers Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus on courses around the world.",1478304000,,1525,5.141129032258065

If those are not fond memories, this may not create new memories, or help recall old ones, but for some of us, this little piece of the past makes the present a bit more special.",1452124800,2,405,4.5479452054794525

2118341,4,B0002T2QRY,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a Bob Hope fan. I bought this because I'm a fan of Christmas specials, and considering how many that Hope did in his career, this is a very nostalgic presentation.

It's packaged as ""Hope for the Holidays"" but by and large it appears to be a retrospective done in about 1993 (when Hope was 90) called ""Bob Hope's Bag Full of Christmas Memories."" Rather than Hope's traditional Christmas episode, it's set up like a Christmas party at the Hope's residence with a cavalcade of diverse former stars, most if not all of whom had appeared on previous specials. As we're introduced to guests at the party, we get a look back at when washed-up has beens like Loni Anderson and Barbara Eden (they were washed-up even in 1993) were important players on the Hollywood scene. It's cheesy, hokey, good clean fun.

The extras are a nice addition, but are limited to duets of ""Silver Bells"" with Hope and various female stars, and a blooper reel.

If you're Hope fan, this is must-see stuff; if you aren't one, much like me, it's still worth a look if you enjoy Christmas specials.",1356220800,,1111,4.545
2118342,4,B0002T2QRY,This wasn't in as good a shape as the Red Skeleton DVD and it was rattling but I contacted the seller and we think it is just the DVD coming loose.  I also sent this to my dad for Christmas so won't know until then how the DVD is until the new year.  It also arrived in timely manner.,1355270400,2,284,3.7966101694915255
2118343,4,B0002T2QRY,Good synopsis of Bob Hope over the years from his TV shows...alot of his opening one liners... brief clips from his war performances. Fast moving...& entertaining. I enjoyed it.,1323475200,,177,5.137931034482759
2118344,5,B0002T2QRY,"This is a quality video of one of Bob's Christmas shows.  This show contains a review of his many USO Christmas tours, along with some regular Hollywood takes.  Brings back good memories of Bob Hope in his prime, and the many co-stars he had with him on USO tours. If you're a Bob Hope fan, you won't be disappointed.",1293580800,2,317,4.3559322033898304
2118345,5,B0002T2QRY,"For those of you who are old enough to remember what watching TV at Christmas time was like back in the 50's, 60's, 70's and even 80's, this DVD will surely bring back a lot of incredible memories.  I can clearly remember waiting patiently each year for Bob Hope's Annual Christmas Special on NBC.  This DVD did not disappoint me in anyway.  There is footage of various skits with Bob Hope and just about every famous celebrity of that era. Even the bonus material containing a number of bloopers was great to watch.
Back in those days, there were only three stations or three networks to watch (ABC, CBS and NBC), but it seemed that there was always something great on TV, no matter what night of the week it was.  NBC was lucky enough to have Bob Hope for so many incredible years.  I truly have to applaud Bob Hope for entertaining our troops each and every year at Christmas and this DVD has quite a few memorable clips from the 50's through the 80's of Bob in some foreign Country with a great looking gal, parading around on the stage. If you are a fan of Bob Hope, or you'd like to experience just one more of Bob Hope's Annual Christmas Specials, then do NOT pass up this unique opportunity.  I assure you that you will NOT be disappointed. As far as the quality is concerned, it's not HD but it's still pretty darn good, even on a 55"" screen.
I have already watched this DVD two nights in a row and I will probably play it again some night before Christmas this year.  This is clearly one of my favorite DVD's of all time.",1291766400,11,1531,4.313588850174216
2118346,5,B0002T2QRY,"Bought this DVD for my mother who lives alone.  Her television keeps her company, but the trash on TV does not appeal to her.  She loved this DVD.",1286928000,,146,4.178571428571429
2118347,4,B0002T2QRY,"This DVD gives you a 'taste' of the Bob Hope Christmas Specials which I grew up on as a child.  It was very enjoyable... though I do wish it was much longer in length.  Actually I would love it - and I'm sure others as well here? - if someone could just do a documentary on Bob Hope's Christmas shows for our nation's troops over the years.  To me this was the funniest and most nostalgic part of the DVD seeing him and his guests - esp. his beautiful female guest stars, some who were singers - interacting with the troops during various war times.  These sections were much more interesting than the 'comedy sketches' which were kind of lame.  Comedy doesn't do well over the years - except for maybe the political humor - as well as the musical segments, I think, IMHO.",1259020800,3,772,4.333333333333333
2118348,5,B0002T2QRY,It was great seeing these classic performances.  Just wish the complete shows were available and not just snippets.  I have always loved Bob Hope and what he did for our servicemen and women overseas during wartime broght them a litle piece of home and for the moment took their minds off what was going on around them.,1256083200,2,319,4.578947368421052

2118352,5,B0002T2QRY,What a great video to add to your Christmas collection!  Entertaining for both young and old.  Many great clips from Bob's USO Christmas shows as well as from his All American football teams.  The bonus features of bloopers will have you rolling on the floor laughing.  I highly recommend this video for everyone.,1227398400,2,313,4.849056603773585
2118353,5,B0002T2QRY,"My dad got to see Bob Hope over in England during WW-2.  I missed him by a day in Subic Bay, Philippines.  Bob Hope is said to have been the greatest comedian ever.  Who am I to argue?  I lived for his Christmas TV specials every winter, and I rolled on the floor to his banter with troops and with the other stars.  This is a very nice collection of some of his best holiday stuffing guaranteed to renew your holiday spirit.  Little else needs to be said.  Just get it and laugh yourself unconscious.",1203033600,10,501,4.2105263157894735
2118354,5,B0002T2QRY,"This Christmas special was done near the end of Bob Hope's life and it features family and friends reminiscing with him about some of his favorite moments from the various Christmas specials he did over the years.  We watched it several times over the holidays.  My kids liked it, but my mother was particularly enchanted by it.  It brought back a lot of memories--for which we eternally thank Mr. Hope!",1201478400,11,403,4.728571428571429
2118355,3,B0002T2QRY,I love Bob Hope and all the wonderful things he did in his life time. Most of the video brought back pleasant memories sitting in front of the TV with my family.  The sitting at his home with friends and family was disapointing and non professional.  I think a single narrator would have been much more effective.,1199664000,5,313,4.473684210526316

2118357,5,B0002T2QRY,"Now that I am in my 30's, I see everything I once knew and loved being replaced with another generation of performers --- most of whom I don't like or are at best mediocre. So few of today's stars can inspire the same admiration I felt when I was a kid. Even as a young boy I knew there was something significant about Bob Hope. I grew up watching his Christmas specials, but so did my father and grandfather (via the USO shows). Bob was just as much a fixture of the holiday as tinsel on a tree. But after he passed, that all seemed to stop.

Fortunately, with this DVD I can now keep a part of that tradition alive. Alongside the annual must-sees like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" I have these wonderful moments of Bob Hope at his holiday best. It has clips and sketches from shows I remember, but also from shows before my time, all of which were laugh-out-loud funny. The extras include bloopers, which should not be missed because it gives a peak at what he was like behind the scenes -- which is as charming and funny as you thought he would be.

If you like Bob Hope and miss seeing his Christmas specials, this DVD will give you a dose of the old - but timeless - holiday spirit that you can share with the next generation. My only complaint is it's not long enough. But I wouldn't be satisfied until there was a DVD box set of each individual Christmas special shown in its entirety. Until that happens, I am very happy to have this to watch again and again.",1199318400,44,1494,4.275618374558304
2118358,4,B0002T2QRY,"This was a good buy.  I remember Bob Hope travelling abroad during the holidays, putting on his shows.  This was a nice way to remember those days.

8031530,5,B0002T2QRY,"For decades, Bob Hope took shows around the world to entertain troops stationed in every remote corner. Each year he was joined by different groups of entertainers who generously donated their time during the holidays as well.

Set against the backdrop of a Christmas party at the home of Bob and his wife Delores, this DVD features clips from both Bob's USO shows and his Christmas specials through the years. Yes, Bob's humor was filled with corny one liners, but that never detracted from how much he could make everyone laugh.

Included on this DVD you'll find classic skits with Bing Crosby, Red Skelton, Loni Anderson and Phyllis Diller, John Forsythe, and a few more. There are USO show clips going back to Korea in the early 50s. Included are a few of the funnier moments that occured when Bob introduced the AP All American football teams each year on his Christmas special. Late in the DVD there is a very nice sequence with Bob and Delores singing Silver Bells, with cuts to various times Bob has performed that song over the years.

As a special feature, there are a few outtakes from Bob's many Christmas specials, and those are also a lot of fun. However, to be honest, Bob ad libbed so much that sometimes the outtakes don't seem a lot different from what made it on the air! LOL

Bob's contribution to entertainment and to generosity of spirit should never be forgotten, and I hope this DVD helps to preserve his memory in the hearts and minds of all of us.

Thanks for the Memories, Bob!",1503360000,6,1504,4.597014925373134
