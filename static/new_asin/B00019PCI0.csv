And different from the rest of the sets,:#2
you're lucky to get multiple volume cases instead of one case which holds bundle of discs' or one disc with reverse side or a set with only five episodes than had to buy a next vol with another 5 eps :#3
It Plays' great for the time of Easter around, with Easter theme to the holiday cheer with a easter egg inside this dvd set you can enjoy a mini game:#4 it's with no doubts... presets a classic image to this nice anime that's better off with the first dub of this anime since the anime has a story to really enjoy'd:#5 Also You might find it better in japanese, an,It! can be watched as a family but know viz was not known to do things that was family friendly in there history of working on shows so I would still for life of it just make it wroth the buy even if the dub takes from the family friendliness :#6 but for the romance-comedy genre it's the only anime for the more realistic feeling and style of rumiko-sama since that much of it is to get kids into it might also found it also more for Adult's.:#7 Also For the reason of fact their's A novel type to better prefer If it hurts the youthfulness who watch it:#8 as I say sense of mature is not for kids to view so better to rip in make a kid like parody of it at time so kids can better relate :#9 and for anime there is over 870 anime and I know that theres a lot of for everyone's taste's:#10 This Anime is a good first one for everyone, but not this, dub could catch you in and This show pokes Jokes out of it to make woman funny so for a first anime I say watch this. The end
P.S.
Also Her first anime called urusei yatsura is her funny Anime of them all I'd became a_long_old FAN oh
And her work I am to say I'd seen since her first and the animax dub and british dub when it first air in The animax asia in on bbc.
I also seen about four dubbed versions of U Y which I say is great for kids of all ages which again not the say the show has the stuff that kids can see but does have edited edition also it has religion parody's-scenes' and one in particular had a eps of Adam and eve scenes' and featured xmas,
And So you best to look for U Y As a also great choice :) it has been on kids station in japan so kids can really enjoy it also It is better way to fix mistakes of miss understanding. It teaches- How to get their selfs not into bigy of jeez of J-i-n-k-i-e's of trouble :8 if you were me, you would seen this as a old show to be a Reminder your old in if you have kids they beat you at that youth of theres XD Funny for I to say but it is true,
An anime after all is meant to get a family friendly fun out of Anime but best to use a form of guiding the kids' before they get to watch things because they might end of being bad people when they turn to be solo XD ALSO enjoy IT Together with a crowd of family to it won't hurt the bound that all family need as the phrase goes!:
together we stand together_and Together We laugh our fanny off! For the fun Keep_Sake.  family of others laugh, Always w XD :)(sic) laugh.",1362268800,,3087,3.923444976076555
8008876,5,B00019PCI0,Thanks for taking the time to read my review. Almost everyone knows what this anime is about so I won't go into details. I just want to answer some previous questions about this series. Most of the people are not sure how well the dubbing was handled by Viz. Don't worry I've seen 60 episodes and the dubbing has been excellent. Another question that was asked by the many fans of this anime was will there be more Maison Ikkoku dvds produced. The answer is yes and volumes 4 and 5 have already come out so make sure to pick up the box sets 4 and 5. Another important fact is that this series was first aired on 1986 and since then has been a huge hit with the fans world wide. With that being said you cannot go wrong with this product so pick up your box set today. Thanks,1118707200,,774,4.132450331125828
8008877,5,B00019PCI0,"This series is great. I will not go into great detail about why, because other people, in other reviews, have done a much better job. I'll just say that the box set is a good buy in the first place, seeing as its 12 eps for 45 dollars, where a normal anime dvd would get you 3-4 epsodes for 25. Then, theres the anime. It's...wonderful, for lack of a better word. This IS romance-comedy, and one of the best examples of the genre I've ever seen. If you're worried about the sitcom-misunderstandings being the entire plot, don't worry, it doesn't work like that. It starts with a lot of misunderstandings, and a Love Hina-like theme, but as the show goes on it becomes more serious. The focus shifts to the competition between Godai and Mitaka. And while the ""misunderstandings"" still happen at the end of the show, the tone is completely different and it avoids being a stereotypical rehash of what came before. This anime is excellent, one of the few where I have given in and bought on dvd. The dubs are sound fine to me, but I usually watch it subbed so, I'll leave dub critiques to someone else. The subtitling is excellent. The video quality is excellent. It is completely worth it, the anime is great, the dvd's are high-quality. All the box sets are definitely worth it.
Now, anyone with a connection to Viz know when the next set is coming out?",1087257600,,1352,4.5
