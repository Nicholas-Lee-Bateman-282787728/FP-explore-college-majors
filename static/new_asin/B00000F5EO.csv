1205834,5,B00000F5EO,"I must admit that although most people don't seem to hold this film in high regard (I don't think it's even considered a cult classic)this is absolutely the best horror movie I have ever seen! It was released to east coast theaters in the United States on March 4, 1983. I was thirteen-years-old when I saw it with my parents that weekend and this movie left quite an impression on me. It touched me in a way no other film has before and I will never forget it. Not that it frightened me, no far from it, but I became obssessed with it and still am to this day at the age of thirty-four, one year older than Tom McLaughlin was when he directed it. I believe it was filmed in the fall of 1982 and took only twenty-eight days to make. It was shot on location in LA using the Hollywood Cathederal Mausoleum for interior shots. A set was built of marble and plywood for the special effects and the filming of the corpses coming out of their tombs. It had an excellent cast: Meg Tilly fresh from her role in ""Tex"" and whom I developed a crush on after seeing the movie, the handsome David Mason Daniels who bears a slight resemblance to Christopher Reeve and for whom I developed a kind of hero worship at that young age (where are they now
,I wonder whatever happened to him, he was a good actor), Adam West(of the '60's batman series), Melissa Newman ( Paul Newman's daughter), Robin Evans as Carol ( a former model and later a ""Rip tide"" girl(1984)), Leslie Speights as Kitty ( I wonder whatever happened to her too?), Elizabeth Daily ( Valley Girl(1983)) and of course a great writer director, Tom Mclaughlin. I have nothing but praise for this film and am eagerly awaiting its release on DVD with special features. I've heard some companies are interested in releasing it, I sure wish they would hurry up and do it! The VHS copies available look really crappy, but if you can manage to rent it( highly unlikely no video stores I know of have it) it's well worth it, I promise you! Buy this film and you will not regret it, watch it in the dark alone , with friends or better yet with your girlfriend or boyfriend. It is definitely a night you will remember until the day you die!",1079136000,21,2179,4.356265356265356
1205835,2,B00000F5EO,"This is not a masterpiece. This is a rechewed remake of so many films on the subject : telekinesis, vampirism, living deads, and a night in a cemetery. A few changes are introduced here and there to give new shades of black to this kind of stale mixture which will not give you the visionary power of some Dune's melange. There are some moments when the springs of fear work and the grossness of many situations and scenes is by far enough to make you feel a little bit sick in the stomach. But if you like grossness and moderate gore, go ahead and practise nauseae at infinitum by playing the tape over and over again. Kids will like it as if it were  a recollection of some summer camp night time ghost story around some camp fire in the depth of some forest.

Spooky enough, and the girls are 1980s girls without filthy mouths or dressing to expose themselves, like so many female film actors do now.  It's not a difficult plot line; extremely powerful psychic dies and carries his powers past death on the same night that one girl stays overnight in a mausoleum to fulfill a sorority test, and her 2 girlfriends show up to scare her.  Entertaining enough without the F bomb everywhere or 'found footage' nonsense that I'm so sick of.  It's entertaining without a lot of work to watch shakey cams and listen to senseless nattering and filthy language.  And no;  I'm NOT old.

1206034,5,B00000F5EO,"In ONE DARK NIGHT (aka: NIGHT IN THE CRYPT, ENTITY FORCE, REST IN PEACE, etc.), an old man's body is discovered, along w/ the cadavers of six young women, in an apartment. The death scene is anything but ordinary, w/ signs of paranormal activity. Meanwhile, goody-two-shoes, Julie Wells (Meg Tilly- PSYCHO 2, IMPULSE) is about to undergo her final initiation into a school club known as THE SISTERS. Two things to know: #1- The old, dead guy was a mysterious psychic named Raymar. #2- Julie's initiation will bring her into close proximity w/ this deceased dabbler in all that is diabolical! Woo-woo music abounds, as Julie is escorted by her so-called ""friends"" to the local mausoleum, where she must spend the night. While all this is going on, Raymar's daughter and her husband (Adam West- ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS, TV's BATMAN), are approached by a strange man, who fills them in on dad's true history, filled w/ fantastic, eeevil phenomena! Back at the mausoleum, Julie is sealed in w/ her new, cold buddies for a long evening! She attempts to make the best of it, exploring her silent surroundings. Of course, her future sisters aren't going to let her have a nice, quiet night in. Unbeknownst to any of them, Raymar still has a few tricks up his supernatural sleeves! ONE DARK NIGHT is 80's horror, at its absolute zenith! By the end, you'll be crying out two things: #1- I can almost smell the mom-n-pop video store! #2- Why does Kitty keep jamming that toothbrush in her mouth?  This is non-stop nirvana, right up through to the magnificently macabre, freak-out finale! Watch this right now! Pronto!...

Also, Meg Tilly has a surprisingly small amount of screen time (considering she's essentially set up to be the STAR). If you decide to sit through this, be prepared to see a TON of boring filler/exposition scenes (where a woman is simply listening to an audio tape).

This whole movie was a great set up for a great & scary ending!

1206093,4,B00000F5EO,"Here we are, 1983, another gem from the decade of horror splatter and quite a good one it is. This time, we see Meg Tilly playing Julie, a ""nice girl"" who wants to join a local high school girls group called ""The Sisters"". The leader of the group, Carol, just seems to want to toil with Julie because she is dating her ex, although Carol claims Julie has wanted into the group long before their relation split. Julie has passed all the tests Carol has dished out so far, but she has one last task sure to do some psychological scaring.

Meanwhile, a known mind control freak, Karl ""RAYMAR"", seeks out young women anyway he can and draws them back to his place of residence. There he performs his mind control of draining all life force from them and then stores such ""energy"" for moving objects at will, which includes the dead. RAYMAR finally ""dies"" and the police and coroners are at the apartment. What they see is so bizarre, they are dumbfounded. He is buried at a local cemetery in a Mausoleum crypt. Later that night, the ""Sisters"", minus one of the group who objects, goes to the cemetery mausoleum to play prankster on the unsuspecting Julie (who finds a room space in a flower closet.) What happens next is a series of events that cause all, even the girls playing the jokes on Julie, to literally be running for the doors to get OUT at all costs!

RAYMAR in his ""charged"" afterlife seeks out more power from the girls, but doing so, he will need a little help from the dead!
Things get ugly fast and soon the sister of RAYMAR sees his deeds in her own mind. She must go to the cemetery mausoleum to put a stop to him once and for all!
The two big movies I remember Meg Tilly in was this one and PSYCHO II from the previous year, 1982.

The picture is good, but could be better. Fans of this movie, like me, can only hope to have a Shout Factory or Scream Factory Blu-ray edition at some point. The zombies, or ""dead"" look pretty good for the year and having no CGI effects used. Just seeing them in the coffins and coming out of them are creepy.

1206129,2,B00000F5EO,"Like many other reviewers, I too saw this in the theater as a child, and I remember being scared by it. I didn't remember too much about the story, only that one of the characters walked around sucking on a toothbrush for most of the movie, and that it had zombies in it. I finally got a chance to re-visit ""One Dark Night"" today, and have to say, it's a film better left in memory and if you have fond memories of watching this as a kid....let them stay fond memories, and don't re-watch this movie.

""One Dark Night"" is the story about Julie (Meg Tilly) wanting to join a sorority (I guess it's a college-age group of 3 other girls) called the ""Sisters"". Too bad for Julie, she's dating the ex-boyfriend of the Sister's leader, Carol. Carol wanting to get back at Julie sets her up for a harsh hazing. In order to join the Sisters, Julie has to stay the night at a local mausoleum. Earlier in the day a famed telekinetic was buried in the mausoleum after his body was found with six murdered girls in his apartment. The evil telekinetic is a psychic vampire that drained the lifeforce of the six girls, and may be more dangerous dead than when he was alive. Oh, and Adam West plays the evil telekinetic guy's son in law!?!?

This is an 88 minute film, with the first ""zombie"" making an appearance at the 72 minute mark. The first on-screen death (I think?) occurs a the 78 minute mark....but I'm not sure if it's a death or just a passing out/knocking out scene? The previous 71 minutes are made up of girls fighting, some cool shots of a 1980's arcade (wow do I want that wall of pinball machines!!), and Adam West acting confused over his father in law's psychic abilities. I should also note that there are really no zombies in the movie...not like we've come to think of them. These are really reanimated corpses who basically hug you and invade your personal space....no brain or flesh eating...just really pushy and annoying.

Not recommended, ""One Dark Night"" is just a slog to get through, with really poor special effects and a threadbare story one that comes very close to a movie riffed by Mystery Science Theater 3000 called ""Ring of Terror"". Save yourself some time and get the MST3K episode instead of watching this.

1206135,5,B00000F5EO,"There are myriad horror movies in the realm of cinema.  In that realm, there are horror movies that were produced in the 1980s.  These films were primarily slasher movies; I feel the term slasher movie should need no introduction.  These films had a formula and a ruse (that is as reliable as the foundation of the romantic comedy).  I for one I have a soft side for 80s (and 70s) slasher films, but there is something very refreshing about this less known 1983 film One Dark Night.  (I actually think I can recall seeing this on HBO back in the 80s when I was six or seven, anyway.)

In modern times this flick might seem rather tame or humdrum, but for the time it was just different. There are two stories in this film that end up blending together. The first story revolves around Meg Tilly's character Julie, who wants to join a popular group of girls.  Actually these girls act like a discount Pink Ladies but whatever.  It should be noted that these are high school girls so of course there is some tomfoolery to be had. The leader of this ""popular click"" is Carol played by Robin Evans. Ms. Evans is absolutely stunning, the epitome of a California Girl with blonde hair, blue eyes and smooth skin, just a dream. Anyway, the click wants Julie to spend the night in a mausoleum as a hazing ruse to be accepted to the group. Well Carol is still sore about Julie dating her ex-boyfriend so she is going to make the night pretty tough on her.

The second tale revolves around a woman named Olivia whose ""creepy warlock like"" father just died. He has been buried in the same mausoleum where this hazing prank is transpiring. The odd thing is he might not be as dead as we all think. Adam West (Batman from 1960 TV show) has a supporting role as Olivias husband and the son-in-law of the recently deceased ""creepy warlock"".

This movie has mood and atmosphere going for it. There is an eerie vibe that makes this film really shine.  There isn't tons of blood and nudity, which I find are always welcomed in a horror movie.  Yet this movie makes up for that by providing the viewer with a slow burn and a very spooky setting inside a mausoleum overnight. However, there is one brief semi-nude scene with Carol.  Does that count? One criticism of this film is the character of Julie almost becomes an afterthought.  I realize this might sound strange, but once one watches the film they might see what I mean.
I have heard that many people are upset about the transfer on this DVD. I found it to look pretty good; there are some scratches here and there. Nevertheless, the picture is clear and the audio for the most part is crisp. I have seen much, much worse slapped on DVD for higher prices.

This is a two disk set and the second disk provides some extras, trailers and behind the scenes.  In addition it provides an alternate version of the movie called Night in the Crypt.  This version provides several changes, some minor and a couple somewhat major, including the ending.  I actually wish there was a way to morph both versions, as they both provide some great material.  Unlike the proper film, the alternate version suffers a bit in picture quality.  It is certainly watchable, but leaves a bit to be desired. Overall, a really good creepy little flick, dated yes, but great nevertheless.  I do my best to watch this movie at least one a year.",1395705600,2,3354,4.492586490939044

I ACTUALLY LIKE THE UNFINISHED DIRECTORS CUT ON THE 2ND DVD BETTER THAN THE FINISHED FILM; AND THE SPECIAL FEATURES AND COMMENTARIES ARE INTERESTING UNLIKE MANY OTHER RELEASES. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF RARE HORROR MOVIES FROM THIS PERIOD (OR A MEG TILLY FAN) THEN THIS IS A MUST-SEE AND A MUST-HAVE!,1347580800,2,395,4.424657534246576
1206180,3,B00000F5EO,"I originally saw ""One Dark Night"" when it was in theaters back in 1983 as a 9 year old lad.  The film had a PG rating so I thought I could handle it. (Boy was I wrong!)  This movie stuck with me and gave me nightmares for several nights afterwards.

A few years ago when I found out this overlooked horror gem was being released on DVD in two discs, I had to get it.  While it was nice seeing this film again as an adult without covering my eyes.  I was a little disappointed with the quality of the transfer.  It's too bad this wasn't remastered and cleaned up.  The DVD extras are nice: audio commentary, a small behind the scenes feature, and a very rough director's cut called ""Night in the Crypt"" with a slightly different ending. Unfortunately Bob Summers haunting film score to this movie wasn't included and continues to elude fans.

The movie itself is still sets a very creepy mood, but might not win over younger audiences of today.  Fans of classic 70's and 80's horror should enjoy it though for what it is and what the film makers were setting out to accomplish. An often overlooked and underrated horror classic.  I recently found out that One Dark Night will soon be getting a blueray release with new extras.  Hopefully this will be a better & much cleaner transfer that this film deserves.",1336608000,,1307,4.449579831932773
1206181,5,B00000F5EO,"I do remember seeing this movie when I was 10. (Well a month shy of being 11 lol) Anyway, I remember the story line and they way it builds and builds. I remember the corps's involved were roaming/floating around seemed chilling and spooky.  I loved the setting being in a Mausoleum too. At the time, I had no idea what that was. I never seen one in real life and I was intrigued. Not to come across as morbid but all the same. I found the special effects and the character development well written too.

It is funny that over the years I had forgotten the title of the move (like other reviewers) but remember the story line. Also the way the corps would float around and scare people. In fact I was trying to recall the title thus googling ""Mausoleum"" and there was a movie that was made in the 1983 called that. Talk about confusing. I guess during that time Mausoleums were a hot topic to place in movies. I never saw the latter and did not have the urge to. After events unfold and time passes I want to see it now.

""One dark Night"" is a master of horror that was swept under the rug and forgotten. As one reviewer pointed out the master copy was not able to be located. I hope they find it and make a beautiful BLu-Ray transfer. I will be ordering this copy soon, cause I am sure that happening is slim. Enjoy!!!",1331856000,,1318,4.222222222222222
1206182,5,B00000F5EO,"I have loved this little horror gem since it came out in the early 80's. It's alot different than a normal zombie movie. THe dead are animated by a force of evil and many look like real dead bodies that are just being pushed along with the force of the mind.  Ok , and meg tilly really carries this movie too, she's just awesome in it. But the print of this movie has scratches and lines all over it!  WHY DON""T they clean it up? lazy company. However you do get a whole other version of the movie too here. SO extra wise it's great.  BUt seriously, the print needs to be cleaned , a blu ray release would be great too. that and astrozombies too.  Clean them up!  However this one is one of the better thought out horror movies of it's time and the extra version is pretty cool. It looks bad too but at least it's just a working print.  Halloween h20 , almost looks this bad on blu ray. Why don't they at least take the time to remove the lines and scratches?  oh well. this is a great horror gem that even non horror fans can enjoy.

1206183,3,B00000F5EO,"Like many other reviewers here, I remember seeing this movie when I was a little kid. It would always comes on at night on cable, and I remember it scaring the living daylights out of me. I haven't seen it again until now, but all those years in between, and I still remember how it freaked me out. I was barely in elementary school! Now, decades later, I have re-discovered this little cult classic, and does it still hold up? Is it still as scary as I remember? First thing's first....

Meg Tilly stars as Julie Wells. She wants to become the newest member of the popular clique at school, The Sisters, which include 80s stalwart Elizabeth Dailey(Valley Girl, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Better Off Dead). Carol, the main girl, is the ex of Julie's boyfriend. Carol and the rest have an initiation for Julie. Spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. What Julie and the others don't know, is that Raymar, a Russian psychic, has just been interred there. Unfortunatley for the girls, 'ol Raymar's magic is still kicking, and some of the mausoleum's residents will no longer be resting in peace.

""One Dark Night"" is not perfect, nor is the DVD transfer. The movie still retains a lot of the ambience, suspense and chills I remember, and it still manages to chill and unnerve in all the right ways. The story is routine (how many times have we seen a character wanting to pledge to a popular group or sorority/fraternity and the initiation going awry?), but it doesn't matter at all. It works. Director and co-writer Tom McLoughlin (who also did ""Friday The 13th VI: Jason Lives"")films everything with such atmopshere and a sense of mounting dread, that it sucks you into the action, even if the first part of the film is something you have seen time and time again. McLoughlin really has an eye for the creep factor, and he films the long hallways of the mausoleum in a way that makes you feel like you are walking down them with Julie. When things really start kicking in in the last 10 minutes or so, it really is riveting. It's scary and undeniably creepy. McLoughlin knows how to set the mood and film the re-animated corpses in a way, and light, that is impactful. The corpses themselves are hideous. I mean that in a good way. All dummies, but most seem very realistic....and gross. Floating down the hallways, with feet barely touching the ground, in all sorts of decay, is a sight. Now, as an adult, I can see why this movie scared me when I was little. Heck, it still creeped me out today!

The cast is adequate. Meg Tilly is likeable as Julie, and Robin Evans is just right as the prissy leader of the clique. Batman himself, Adam West, pops up in a thankless role. It is a little odd to see Batman show up among the horror, but then he just has no point. Also, watch out for McLoughlin's wife, Nancy, pop up as Lucy. Elsewhere, the corpse make-up is disturbingly real and unsettling, and beat anything you would see now in today's CGI saturated world.

The DVD is a cool release, but the transfer is pretty iffy. Normally, I don't like these older movies to be too cleaned up, or look super slick and shiny like most of today's soulless horror films. I like movies to look like MOVIES. That being said, this one wasn't touched up at all. Not even a little bit. There are scratches in the film and on the soundtrack. It doesn't bother me at all, but it may to others. Also, disc 2 includes the director's cut. That cut was definitley not worked on either. There are even moments where there is no sound. Still, this 2 disc collection is a treat for the fans. It's great to see the director's cut, even if it's in questionable shape. There is also a great commentary track with McLoughlin and co-writer Michael Hawes. Disc 2 also includes a great 38 minute featurette from 1982. Not a docu, but just behind the scenes filming of the movie. It's a great look into the making of this movie. The movie also runs for 88 minutes, and not the 94 minutes printed on the back.

In the end, ""One Dark Night"" is not original in it's basic concept, but the situation Julie finds herself in is. It's a slow burn to the last few minutes, but it shouldn't matter. McLoughlin smothers the film in atmosphere, chills, and enough mounting tension and dread, that getting to the final payoff is just as much fun. This is that kind of movie. A kind they don't really make anymore. If this is your kind of thing, ""One Dark Night"", despite some minor flaws and poor DVD transfer, delivers.",1293148800,,4472,4.488943488943489
1206184,4,B00000F5EO,"To find this film after all these years. I saw it in the theater when it was released. Back then I was in my early 20s. They couldn't make enough suspense/horror films for me, lol. Am thinking I saw every one that was released during the early- to late-'80s when the genre was still popular.

Over time I had forgotten the title of this one but not the details. A friend on a forum site found the title recently.

As has been mentioned in previous reviews, the last half hour or so of this film is what makes it so memorable. Worm-riddled corpses dressed in rotted period clothing or what's left of it, seemingly resurrected from the grave and moving toward the viewer. These final scene effects were quite detailed and realistic for the time.

Adam West plays a rather boorish role as RayMar's son-in-law. Not West's finest hour but it's nice to see him looking so young.

Unlike many suspense flicks of the era, One Dark Night doesn't spring those heart-stopping surprises that caused one to jump back in his seat (and in doing so, dump twenty dollars worth of popcorn and Coke Cola on the theater floor and your girlfriend's good outfit). Rather, the story line builds slowly, allowing the viewer to focus on what's happening.

This film is more in the suspense genre than the horror genre. Horror film icons like Freddy Krueger and Chuckie were great at what they did. Unlike a good suspense flick the horror genre focuses more on blood and gore than telling a story.

Agreed, One Dark Night carries the infamous ""teen fright"" baggage. But so do some of Stephen King's stories. Like any fine suspense tale, it builds to a climax and gets good at the end.

Some younger viewers who are accustomed to today's elaborate, computer-generated effects and 3-D animation may not be overly impressed by this film. It does contain some props that reflect the times. Props such as rotary dial telephones, pinball machines and the 75 photo booth. Our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket. The teens aren't texting not chatting on cell phones. But as the old saying goes, you had to be there. :)

4 stars for the less-than-stellar transition from the original. Aside from than that, I love it. It's great to see it again. Kudos to the folks at Amazon for quick shipping.",1254528000,5,2269,4.640897755610973
1206185,5,B00000F5EO,"Although this is a pretty lavish two disc edition, the theatrical print used for the transfer has some bad scratches, dirt, splices and audio pops and hisses.  Sad Anchor Bay didn't grab this one up, they would have done a decent restoration and given the film soundtrack a remix.  The colors are sharp and the grain isn't too bad but the constant scratches and glitches in the picture are distracting.  It was nice to watch the work print version that is included on the second disc but I can't imagine I would ever sit through it more than once as the picture quality of this version looks to be second generation VHS in a pan and scan format.  The behind the scenes footage is extensive and fairly entertaining and the audio commentary for the film is very interesting.  I could give this release a rave review if the quality of the print had been at an acceptable standard.  This is one of the best horror films from the 80's and I hope at some point it gets the restoration that it deserves instead of this very uneven attempt.",1253836800,4,1032,4.462765957446808
1206186,5,B00000F5EO,"Since Jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense.

This little film is different. Made in the early 80's it does what every good horror film should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. Then, you make those horrors simmer, just don't turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering.

The story features Meg Tilly right before she had a short-lived turn with fame starting with ""The Big Chill"" and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90's. Meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls. They tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt. The mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward - further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her.

Meanwhile famed occultist Karl Rhamarevich has died shortly after having discovered a way to become even more powerful in death through telekinesis. His daughter doesn't believe this at first, but she listens to a tape about her father's experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw power from these animations. She also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead. I think you know where this story is headed, so I'll stop here.

I will mention that the DVD does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently. I saw it on TV in the mid 1980's and I remember it looking better than this. The problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the DVD had to be created from a print. This means it comes complete with dirt and scratches.

This is worth checking out for any horror fan. It was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on latenight TV until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986. Only TCM Underground airs this kind of film anymore.",1240099200,4,2375,4.4631336405529956

1206230,3,B00000F5EO,"One Dark Night is a brave attempt to do something different in the horror genre, and in places the film really outshines many of its rivals. However the overall story is weak, not to mention extremely far-fetched.

To get the plot out of the way, a group of mean girls offer a shy girl called Julie (Meg Tilly) the chance to join their gang if she will dare to spend one night locked up in a mausoleum. Julie accepts, however what none of them know is that a famous psychic with eerie powers has just been entombed within the very same mausoleum , and his corpse is not about to rest in peace! Well that sets up a pretty good (but standard) scenario for some supernatural scares, but the film takes almost all of its running time to reach this point. Most of the build up is centered around the girls rivalry and scheming, and this takes far too long. At least other films like ""Hell Night"" (which you could say this movie has a very vague resemblance to) actually start with the lock-in and build straight from there, but here, its 40 minutes in before the doors actually close on our heroine, and well over over the one hour mark before the spooky activity really started.

So sadly, nearly all the mayhem is confined to the last 15 minutes of the movie, so you'll have to be patient. But once it does start (and while it lasts), the film really rocks. The mausoleum becomes a pretty frightening vision of hell as the supernatural powers of the psychic start to terrorize poor Julie. Special effects are top notch, and you'll be seeing quite a few very realistic looking corpses that probably scared the actresses so much they didn't really need to act.

On that note, the acting's ok, and Meg Tilly makes an appealing lead, however, the script seems to have been designed to make you completely lose sympathy in the main character of Julie, as she goes from spunky heroine to spaced out, quivering wreck by the end of the film, with barely any dialogue. This annoyed me somewhat. After the eye-popping assault that I mentioned above, I would have preferred Julie to have been given rather more notable treatment in the climax, but everything ends very swiftly and without any real closure.

However these things aside, I enjoyed the film and think it was a pretty good idea. The mausoleum interior looks great, the lighting is cool and the corpses are fantastic.

Raymor has just recently been entombed.  Okay, so unless you remember this as a kid and are sentimentally attached OR like your Horror on the extremely light side (as in no blood, no guts, no death, no swearing, no nudity, and no scares) this probably won't do much for you... on the other hand, if your Grandparents are throwing a ""spooky"" Halloween party then this is a fairly safe choice for the old DVD player.  Taking place almost entirely in a mausoleum does provide some nice atmosphere but unfortunetely it's wasted with an overlong build up (over an hour before anything really happens) and special effects that make your local seasonal High School haunted house seem frightening and realistic in comparison.  I don't have anything against a good ""slow-burn"" type of film, but after investing in a movie for so long it has to deliver in the end... this one doesn't.  For those of you out there that do like the movie, this release from Shriek Show is quite a treat.  Although their clean-up and presentation is rarely up to the standards of some of their competition (Anchor Bay, Blue Underground, Dark Sky, etc.), they have more than made up with it in the bonus features provided including a director's cut.

1206238,4,B00000F5EO,"A girl desperatly wants to join a group of other girls but she has to pay a price: she has to spend the night in the local mausuleum. Not much going on you might think. But in a subplot we've allready seen that a mysterious, paranormal-gifted madman is just buried there.

And, as it turnds out, even after his demise, this madman still has a lot of nasty energy within him that wants to ""get out"" at all cost, making other lost souls in the building come to some sort of ""half living state"" again.

About all the reasons why I liked this cheap, obscure little horror movie, I have allready mentioned in my user comments review of ""Oasis of the Zombies"" a.k.a. ""Oasis of the living dead"".

The low budget gives it a distinct cheap look, which suggests a bit of a documentary-feel, and it has a quiet kind of atmosphere in the overal tone although there's still a lot of screaming and running in this one.

Just like the zombies in ""Oasis of the living dead"", the living dead who terrorize the girl and some other accidental invaders, are not screaming, running, jumping or acting franticly: they just emerge from their tombs and, quietly gazing, start to move across the floors of the seeming endlessly, dimly lit corridors.

This quietness the undead produce during their menacing assault is some kind of releaf, well... for me it is anyway, and a stray from the too much seen hysterical-zombie-running-and-howling stuff.

But think of this as well: the most eerie scene we catch right at the beinging. Police officers enter the room of an alledged serial killer. The scenery they (and we) witness is both very awkward and strange: a handful of dead girls' bodies lay stacked away in a closet, and kitchen items like plates and forks are stuck in the wall - no extreme blood or gore, but an enstranged, weird and very creepy mise-en-scene which immediately asks for answers.

But what the answers are is of lesser importance. It's how to start a movie in a good and haunting way, without throwing in a shoot-out, a clich chase of cops and criminals, or a million dollar of cheesy sfx.

It's an eerie and off-beat but highly disturbing start and could have come out of the pen of such `masters of the weird tale' as Thomas Ligotti or Ramsey Campbell.

Okay, there are long, overstretched moments of dullness that break the underlying tention quite a bit. But all the things I mentioned above make this obscure little scare a treat none the less.",1152403200,3,2445,4.61520737327189

Who would have thought One Dark Night (1983), aka Night in the Crypt (1982), aka Dark Night aka Entity Force aka Mausoleum aka Night of Darkness aka Rest in Peace, in all its relative obscurity, would find its way onto DVD (in a two disc set, no less) before some other, more well known horror nuggets from the 1980s, like Night of the Comet (1984), Curtains (1983), Night of the Creeps (1986), From Beyond (1986), or Visiting Hours (1982)?  Actually, Visiting hours is set for a DVD release in April 2006...but I digress...co-written and directed by Tom McLoughlin (Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Sometimes They Come Back), the film stars a young Meg Tilly (Psycho II, The Big Chill). Also appearing is Melissa Newman (Revenge of the Stepford Wives), Robin Evans (Fire In the Night), Leslie Speights (GoBots: War of the Rock Lords), Elizabeth Daily (Valley Girl, Streets of Fire), David Mason Daniels (""Days of Our Lives""), and Adam West (""Batman"", Chicken Little), sans the Batsuit.

As the film begins it's a dark and stormy night, and we see a woman awoken by vision...next we see a small convoy of coroner's vans approaching an apartment building in a downtown area, arriving at a bizarre scene of a number of deaths within one of the apartments including one man and six women.  Turns out the man was named Raymar, and, when alive, was considered some sort of great and powerful mentalist.  Next we meet a group of high school students including Julie (Tilly), Carol (Evans), Kitty (Speights), Steve (Daniels), and Leslie (Daily), whose got a hicky on her neck the size of a softball, indicating she may have been attacked by an overly amorous shop vac.  Seems Julie is interested in joining the local, harmless girl gang (known as The Sisters), only problem is Carol, the leader of the gang, and quite the hot little number, is determined to give Julie a hard time as she still smarting from getting the old dumperoo from hunky Steve (Steve took up with Julie shortly afterwards).  Anyway, she decides Julie should spend the night in a local mausoleum, the same one where Raymar was recently interred (the woman at the beginning was actually Raymar's estranged daughter Olivia, played by Newman).  The Sisters, including Carol, Kitty and Leslie (three girls doesn't seem much of a gang) goad Julie into going along with the stunt, their intent being to come back later and scare the wits out of her...which really isn't necessary as Raymar, who, as it turns out was (and still is) some sort of psychic vampire, and he's not completely dead (seems the negative psychic energies he drew upon when alive are sustaining him in some form after his death).  The Sisters show up (sans Leslie who chickened out), Steve eventually makes the scene, and all get to experience the weird fun a semi-dead psychic vampire can wreak on a mausoleum full of oozing, rotten, maggot ridden corpses (talk about having friends, or should I say fiends, in low places)...

One of the things that sets One Dark Night apart from a great many horror films released in the 1980s is there is no blood.  There's some ooze (emanating from the rotten corpses), but nary a drop of the hemoglobin...that's not to say no one gets murderlized, but it's just not shown in the graphic detail normally present in the various slasher films of the day.  What the film lacks in visceral content, it makes up for in creepiness and atmosphere (most of the film takes place in the mausoleum).  I'll be the first to admit that while there's really not much of a story here, the special effects aren't terribly special, the pacing very slow at times, and the acting often amateurish, the movie has charm and heart (in spades), and succeeded in keeping my interest.  Now I say there isn't much of a story, but one could make the argument that it was kept simple.  As for the special effects, some were quite good, considering the low budget nature of the film.  Some of the corpses show a good deal of detail, while others looked pretty rubbery.  One interesting aspect was the animated corpses didn't actually walk around, but hovered about a foot or so off the ground as Raymar used his awesoma powers on them to do his bidding.  I was kinda disappointed Raymar didn't do much of anything except hover in one spot and shoot electricity out of his eyeballs (that bit looked cool), as he used his powers to manipulate his surroundings...I guess when you're in a semi-dead state, the less you move around the better.  I mentioned the acting in general was amateurish, but, for most, this seemed their first, real gig (including director McLoughlin), so I don't want to come off sound harsh or unnecessarily critical.  I would have liked to seen Adam West have a bigger role as he was limited to the part of Olivia's husband, and didn't have a whole lot of screen time.  Tilly was believable as a high school student, but the rest seemed a lot more mature than any of the kids I ever attended school with, except maybe for that one freaky kid in everyone's class who was able to grow facial hair before anyone else.  That Robin Evans...her character may have been a nasty, vindictive, mean spirited one, but she had it going on...can anyone tell me why Kitty, the African American girl (woman) constantly had a toothbrush sticking out of her mouth?  It was really annoying, so much so even one of the characters in the film commented on it.  I said the pacing is slow, and it is, up until about the last twenty minutes or so, when things really kick into gear...there's a great number of scenes showing the wall of Raymar crypt cracking and red light emitting from said cracks prior to his finally rising from the grave.  Yeah, okay, we know he's stirring about inside so let's get on with it...despite the obvious flaws the movie was still a lot of fun, and worth checking out if you're into harmless scares sans the gore.

The picture quality on this Media Blaster/Shriek Show 2 set DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic, looks decent, but does suffer from some flaws due to age as a couple of frames are missing, and there's dust and specking present.  I've read where the original elements weren't available, so they had to make due with what they could find...while the picture may not be perfect, it's a hell of a lot better than any of the various bootlegs I've seen over the years.  I thought the Dolby Digital mono audio came across well.  As far as extras, there's a feature length commentary track with director Tom McLoughlin, a behind the scenes featurette entitled ""R.I.P."", an alternate director's cut of the film titled ""A Night in the Crypt"", trailers for other Media Blasters DVD releases including The Being (1983), Frankenstein's Bloody Terror (1968), Just Before Dawn (1981), Devil Dog (1978), Anthropophagus (1981), Love Bites (2001), and a High School Horrors Triple Feature set.  Oh yeah, there's also an actual film cell thrown in for good measure.

By the way, if I learned anything from this film it's not to flick your spent doobie at the tomb of a dead mentalist, as they seem to take offense...",1144195200,15,7139,4.718423169750603
1206300,2,B00000F5EO,"The film basically follows two groups of characters, one is a young girl named Julie, who wants to prove to a group of girls in a club called The Sisters that she got what it takes to join the club, despite her not being in the in crowed. The other group is a husband and wife couple, where the wife is a daughter of a recently deceased powerful psychic. After his death, a number of questions have been brought up, especially since his body was found with a number of others. We later learn that  he discovers a way to suck the life force  out of people, which grants him great power, and after his death his power somehow grows even stronger. Back to Meg Till's chracter, she finally has one last step to prove that she can make it in the club, which just so happens to be spending the night in a mausoleum that now houses the body of the psychic. Thinking they can scare the hell out of the eager Julie, the girls dawn Hollween masks and props , and set out to the mausoleum. It doesn't take long before the psychic's powers escape his coffin and awaken the dozens of rotting corpses that lay side by side, leaving the deceased man's daughter possibly the only one to put a stop to the madness. For an 80's movie this film surprisingly focuses more on building  the story rather than the typical cheesy deaths and T&A to keep the pace going. For those patient enough to watch the first half of the film you might be  pleasantly surprise by the out come. I know I was. I wanted to like the movie more, and I seriously considered a better rating , but I just counldn't get into the slow pacing as much as I wanted to. Overall a underated 80's movie that doesn't rely on chessy deaths and gratuatous nudity to keep the audience attention.

Classic horror with not a lot of gore but a genuine spooky atmosphere with a good build-up, especially when she is walking around the crypt at the start of the film. EXCELLENT!!",1140825600,3,377,4.094594594594595
1206302,3,B00000F5EO,"PLOT: Meg Tilly plays a high schooler who agrees to spend one dark night in a mausoleum alone or so she thinks. A recently interred psychic named Raymar uses his powers after death to wreak havoc inside the crypts and that includes playing with corpses. EG Daily co-stars. Adam West (aka Batman 1966) has a pretty dull background role. Kevin Peter Hall (aka Predator) is also in the movie and seen for a few seconds in basketball shorts.

REVIEW: Acting is decent across the board, but dialogue is a little amateurish here and there (""Your father was a genius in his field...well, until...""  Until what???). The first five minutes draw you in, but the middle act can be tough to sit through. It's mainly the parts where the high school soap opera kicks in. There is no nudity, blood and guts or even adult language. Maybe why this movie has been forgotten about by so many. You will remember the Makeup effects - excellent esp considering the time. Lots of latex decay. The optical ""light"" effects look cheesy in places, namely the red visible bioenergy.

Good music where it counts, though some parts for the quiet, non-horrific scenes sound too dramatic for what is on screen. Particularly out of place is the end credits music.

QUALITY: DVDs are usually transferred from a negative but since there seemed to be none existing for 'ONE DARK NIGHT' the distributor had to cull 35mm prints together and clean them up best they could, something they do often with other titles.

This widescreen transfer is in basic stereo, looks like it could have used more time to polish it up but the speckles and reel changes are not so distracting and the colors are sharp. You won't need the old VHS and since it never got release on laser, this is the best way to see the movie.

SPECIAL FEATURES: Not special at all. The package lists the Production Stills as a feature but they are not included.

There is a good amount of videotaped behind the scenes of footage from the beginning to the end.

NIGHT IN THE CRYPT is included. This was a previously unreleased early edit. Like a work print, it has minimal music in the background, is of lesser quality, and runs pretty much the same length BUT there are several different scenes and angles.

********** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **************************************** More mausoleum shots, more dialogue in certain spots, and a different ending!

There are NO trailers or TV spots for the film just a bunch of OTHER Shriekshow titles advertised. This is what Media Blasters normally does so it is possible that a trailer for ONE DARK NIGHT will show up on some future release. (and that is lame!)",1140480000,2,2632,4.72707423580786

Tom McLoughlin's 'ONE DARK NIGHT'(aka:a night in the crypt)is one of my very favorite childhood fright flicks & is one of the very core reasons i got into the loonytoon idea of owning every horror move ever made! Many disturbing images & the ultra spooky atmosphere that shoulders this film have stuck with me after all these years & finaly without even remembering the actual title i by chance stumble apon this excellent 2 disk special edition set with a limited edition 35mm collectible film strip(what a logical but unique treat)you also get a Director's cut version 'A NIGHT IN THE CRYPT' & the film quality of both versions isn't too great BUT NO COMPLAINTS HERE!(i've been waiting far too long to complain about small stuff)anyway in my opinion this is a must for any horror fan & especially a child of the 80's.

The finaly 20 minutes are when all the creeps come out, and the corpse effects are on par with what was going on in the hit Poltergeist the same year--in fact, a couple of the corpses look like they were borrowed from that film! The other plus of this movie--it has EG Daily, an 80s teen flick queen!

As for the video, the transfer is sharp, but the film itself is loaded with tears and specks, as well as some REALLY choppy edits, as if it was recorded from the actual cinema projector reels. Audio is a bit muffled, and only in stereo. There's a director commentary--and then on disc 2 (yes, it's actually TWO discs) there are behind the scenes clips and stills, plus a ""director's cut"" of the film--which shows it was originally titled ""a night in the crypt."" You also get a warning before this cut that it's from a very bad original print--and it is.

But now that it's coming out on DVD I'll just have to see it again as I recall it after all these years as a low budget, yet very effective little chiller.  Not overly gory as it was still the early 1980's, but provides more chills than many of its brethren from the same period.  A young Meg Tilly stars as a high school girl trying to join an exclusive clique called ""The sisters"".

In order to join she has to be hazed or tested by spending the night in a big, creepy mausoleum.  The mausoleam just happens to be the resting place of an undead Russian psychic whose mind is still working overtime.  He's essentially a vampire that feeds off fear rather than blood and uses his powers to bring the dead to life and to scare Julie (Tilly) and the rest of the kids inside.  so we have these kids being chased throughout the Mausoleum by these undead (although don't expect Romero type zombies here).

Okay, it's low budget but it's got a lot of very good horror elements and some genuine suspense that so many present day movies lack.  Adam West is also in the film along with leo Gorcey Jr., the son of Leo Gorcey of Bowery Boys fame.",1135641600,5,1255,4.283898305084746
1206340,5,B00000F5EO,"Okay, So here I am, an avid horror movie fan since i was about 8 years of age.  I'm 35 now and I seen this film back in September of 1982 with my 7th grade school chums.  Few Girls, Few boys and we all got freaky scared from this film.  Story line is typical of any other films we see today;  Girl wants to be in snotty clique with popular girls in school;  meanwhile, Creepy Old Man killer/kidnapper ""RAYMAR"" [A name you will always remember after seeing this thriller..]  is being buried in the local Mausoleum.  JUST AS THE SAME NIGHT the snotty girls hold there initiation for the 'nice girl Julie' to scare her to death.  Howeverrrrr...the joke is on the girls!  I won't give anything away but this film was both written very well and directed very well. FOR A PG rated film, THE SPECIAL EFFFECTS ARE GREAT!  Today this would 'clearly' be PG-13.  I had a chance to email the writers of this great film and I'm hoping its changed, but back last year he said they were not going to have any features with the girls.  A commentary would of rocked with them today to watch them 'then'.  It would of been cool to see where they are now because all the girls in this film were unique and had different likings about them.  I especially enjoyed watching ROBIN EVANS playing the No. 1 mean girl CAROL!  SHE IS GORGEOUS in this film and with its 80's look its just alll so inocent and I wish I could go back into time, to that night when we all walked to the movies when life was easy to see ONE DARK NIGHT!

Finally, thanks to Shriek Show ""One Dark Night"" is coming to DVD.

When you consider the setting for the film, a mausoleum, you know it's going to be creepy. Just the thought of sleeping overnight in a mausoleum makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand straight up. One dark night is a perfect movie to watch on a late evening or on Halloween night; it's a cinematic example of what Halloween is all about.

Mausoleums, Telekinesis, graveyard scenes, and coroner scenes,including a very strange and eerie scene where 6 dead girls are found in the recently deceased man's appartment all piled together with their staring eyes wide open! The background music is quite effective too in adding to the moviegoer's experience.

""One Dark Night"" is an underrated and, most likely, underviewed horror movie. Easily worth recommending for fans of the early 80's horror flicks that we've all come to know and love.

Despite the lack of Gore this Film succedes due to strange floating camera work an effectively weird soundtrack and a very Macabre Plot.

Despite all of its nonsense, ONE DARK NIGHT (AKA Rest in Peace, A Night in the Crypt, or Mausoleum) is a fun grade B movie that delivers, if only for its effective atmospheric build-up and its exciting dead-corpse galore conclusion.  Tom McLoughlin's tight and well-executed direction makes up for a too stereotypical characterization and a too long-to-get-there horror action.

'One Dark Night' has a good creepy build-up in it's story which eventually becomes an action filled fight for survival in a mausoleum. This is a story that begins with the death of a psychic named Raymar. Raymar's estranged daughter is visited by a strange investigator who is there to inform her of her father's past activities and try to convince her to stop what he suspects is her father's plan (don't get too comfortable with the idea that Raymar is dead). It seems that Raymar has spent his life (and frankly the lives of others) experimenting with life energy. At first he experimented with mice: taking the life energy from them and then reanimating and controlling their bodies with their own life energy. Raymar's obsession has eaten away at his humanity as Raymar has apparently been experimenting with humans (this is punctuated by an effective if not disturbing scene of several corpses in a closet). Alas, poor Raymar (I am not going to do it), I knew him Horatio (I am so weak); Raymar has bored of his accomplishments (?); but wait, there is hope; instead of reanimating others, could Raymar reanimate himself after death? Enter into the story a young high school girl played by Meg Tilly. Meg wants to be in this snooty (I am being kind) high school girls click, but she has to pass the initiation first (and you thought there was going to be a clever plot device,...nah). The girls put her up to spending a night alone in a mausoleum (but she won't be alone, Raymar was just entombed today). Of course the other girls are not going to let her off that easy as they plan to sneak into the mausoleum and scare her (boy those clever plot devices just keep flying off the scriptwriter's pen). I do believe we can all foresee what is about to happen. This movie does definitely have it's creepy moments and some good story development that cops out to a special effects filled climax. My main complaint about the climax is their confusion with the term animated. Raymar himself might as well have been played by a mannequin (for all I know, he probably was). For the climax to have been Raymar's plan, makes Raymar appear to not have been that bright (what was the point). If you look at this movie from a different perspective, however; that it is a fairly cliched movie with some originality thrown in; you may well find it to be quite entertaining and creepy.-Bob",1099612800,3,2597,4.575107296137339

With this movie, a lot of time and attention was given to detail, and plot as well as creepiness.
