8408316,3,B003XMD59U,"I watch Bollywood films quite a bit, but I've never been to India. What I know about the country is drawn more from my watching Bollywood than from catching up on current world events (because I am callow like that). But it leads me to this: I'm not sure how exaggerated or true to form this movie is in its portrayal of India's educational system. The stuff I see in PAATHSHAALA is pretty appalling.

New music and English teacher Rahul Prakash Udyavar (Shahid Kapoor), one of them idealistic sorts, steps into the well regarded Saraswati Vidya Mandir school, an institution on the cusp of drastic change. There is a growing movement in which school systems are leaning towards profit over education, and the Saraswati Vidya Mandir school, frankly, isn't a cash cow. Accordingly, this dictates new management, and Aditya Sahay (Nana Patekar), who has toiled for three decades as school principal, is forced to give way.

The new regime implements its money-making program, never mind that this comes at the expense of the students' welfare. It's wack (and pretty damn unethical) when kids are forced to pay fees just to use athletic equipment and play the school's musical instruments. It only gets worse when, in a frenzy of brand building, the school allows a reality television show to shoot on premises. And there's no subtlety at all in portraying the film crew as inhumane ogres. Charles Dickens would be in awe.

I think this was meant to be a children's picture. Chunks of PAATHSHAALA are devoted to tracking the stories of the kid actors. The teens get wrapped up in their various romances (predictably, one girl has a crush on Shahid). The younger kids are cute, although a number in this bunch gang up on one ugly duckling stricken with a staggeringly ghastly facial birthmark.

The story arrives at a crucial moment when the students and teachers go on strike, with Rahul emerging as a leading figure. This revolt promptly becomes  controversial national news. At this point, we think we know how the story ends. And, okay, there's a reconciliation of sorts - and there's even a moment in which the slimy manager looks shamefaced - but if you do stay to the finish, you can't help but notice that the school's problems don't actually get resolved. The story sort of carefully sidesteps the issue.

It's a statement to how earnest and well-intentioned PAATHSHAALA is that the songs are few and unintrusive - I liked ""Aye Khuda Mujhko Pata"" - and that Shahid Kapoor and Ayesha Takia aren't paired up romantically, all this so that the focus stays on message. The three leads - Kapoor, Takia, Patekar - keep it low keyed, and maybe too low keyed. Ultimately, good intentions aren't enough when the execution isn't there, and it isn't the leads' performances as much as it is the screenplay which is cluttered and unwieldly. Part of that is the crudeness and obviousness of the rest of the cast which get stuck with stereotypical roles. No character embodies the film's ill-conceived treatment more so than the school manager who is an asshat of the first order. His conduct against teachers, parents, and students is so over-the-top revolting that it loses the film tons of credibility.

No doubt that PAATHSHAALA was partly inspired by Aamir Khan's wonderful TAARE ZAMEEN PAR. Only, PAATHSHAALA isn't nearly as emotionally resonant. TAARE ZAMEEN PAR (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Like-Stars-on-Earth-Two-Disc-DVD-CD/dp/B001N6FPRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Like Stars on Earth (Two Disc DVD + CD)</a>) superbly, incisively conveys its school's callousness and neglect, and maybe it's because that story focuses more on one child's battle against dyslexia rather than on a whole mess of children. In contrast, PAATHSHAALA is a scattershot, almost self-indulgent effort, with too many characters, and too many cliched characters at that. PAATHSHAALA's cast and crew should be credited for attempting to open eyes regarding an untenable educational condition. If only the movie were stronger, more finessed, how much more impactful would the message have been? When Nana Patekar delivers that climactic closing speech, it isn't impassioned as much as it is lukewarm. This sums up the movie.

I feel like I should mention this next bit, even though I purchased this DVD from another web site. Maybe around half an hour into the movie, my DVD player started making a funny noise which it had never done before. I opened it up and found that the art on the DVD had begun to come off in flakes, possibly caused by the heat of the DVD player. Now, this is the first time I've ever had a bad product from Eros International, so I'm far from a condemning mood. But I just thought you should know...",1284336000,2,4740,5.029299363057325
