8407474,4,B003WQ5C3E,"As others have mentioned this is not a documentary about the band SNFU, it's a look at the life of Ken Chinn, the singer. It goes into the circumstances that have influenced his lyric writing and choice of subject matter for SNFU songs. Watching this documentary made me go back and listen to the SNFU catalogue and discover some of the deeper meaning of the songs. It's both sad and exciting at the same time and definitely worth watching if you're a fan of SNFU.

IMPORTANT!!! - I was happy to discover that you can BUY the digital download of this documentary for only $5 on vimeo.com.",1391126400,,588,4.4953271028037385
8407475,5,B003WQ5C3E,"First off, this is a must see for any true punk fan. That being said, it is a incomplete piece of work. The absence of Belke is obviously apparent and makes a big difference. As for Mr. Chi Pig, he is a fascinating human with a lot of problems and I couldn't get enough of him. His story is a story of a true punk legend (albeit not very glamorous....at all) and I think this DVD captures that aspect of Mr. Chi Pig very well. There's not a lot of live footage, but the interviews are what make this DVD.",1380672000,,504,4.05
8407476,5,B003WQ5C3E,"Mr. Chi Pig is arguably one of the most original voices in Punk, as well as being one of the most charismatic singers to ever grace a stage. OUASMCP is a great doc, that focuses on all aspects of Chi's career with SNFU and out, with acts such as The Wongs and Slave Co. Former and current band members are interviewed, as well as friends and other associates tell there storys about Chi. I would liked to have seen Brent and Marc belke comment, however I understand why they might have choose not to be included in this doc. Highly recommended to all fans of SNFU, Punk, or just touching storys abour survival and determination.",1288396800,2,628,4.469565217391304
