7925499,3,6302805252,"I thought this series (both Vol. 1 and 2) were a good source of historic blues info. I especially like the way they corelate historic events such as the 1929 Market Crash and WWII with blues events and artists. The only criticism I have is that it mixes too much jazz with the blues. I know there's a bluesy side of jazz (Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, et. al.) but that's space in the video that could have been dedicated to blues people: more down home delta guys, Chicago 50 & 60s, Texas, New Orleans, West Coast, British, you name it, but no jazz filler, please!",996451200,5,569,4.428571428571429
