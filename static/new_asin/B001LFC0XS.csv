8318005,5,B001LFC0XS,I ordered this video because I saw parts of it on TV and wanted my own copy.  It was an informative documentary about Elvis' childhood to his stardom.  Actual footage and photos were used when possible and it included interviews with his childhood friends.  This video was very interesting and well done!,1373932800,,304,4.8076923076923075

8318007,5,B001LFC0XS,"In-depth research, old photos and interviews with childhood friends  provide fresh insights into Elvis's early life.  This 90-minute documentary takes you from Tupelo to Memphis and back to Tupelo, just as Elvis is about to become the first superstar.  The DVD also features some fascinating extras about Elvis, especially exploding the myth that he was a racist.  All in all, a satisfying and beautifully executed film that is well worth the investment of time and money.",1232409600,9,472,5.171052631578948
