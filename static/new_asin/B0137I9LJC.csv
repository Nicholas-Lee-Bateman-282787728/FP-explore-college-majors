7360698,5,B0137I9LJC,I can't say enough about the George Lopez show. This was a good one for sure. (AND there is NO way I can say enough about Constance Marie. My God but the woman is a gem. A gem). Hopefully season 6 is released soon so us GL show fans can have all 6 seasons on hand at home.,1445644800,,272,3.706896551724138

7360700,4,B0137I9LJC,"I love George Lopez.  The guy is just plain funny.  Season 5 looks great and as the others have mentioned, every episode is in 16:9 widescreen and crystal clear.

My only complaint is that none of the season 5 episodes were transfered to DVD in stereo sound.  They are all in mono sound on all 3 DVD's.  I am disappointed at this turn.  So far, seasons 1 through 4 on DVD have been in full stereo sound.  The entire series was recorded and aired in stereo sound, and Nick-At-Nite shows them currently in stereo sound.

We are all eagerly awaiting the final season 6 to be released on DVD.  I just hope they are in stereo sound.",1442361600,3,627,4.2905982905982905

7360702,4,B0137I9LJC,"I just received this and it looks good.  Despite what it says on the disc, the show is presented in widescreen (even on my old full screen tv), which matches the info listed on Warner archive.  Other than that, this is a great set with all the episodes from season 5.  Now please release season 6.",1440720000,2,297,4.267857142857143

8727064,4,B0137I9LJC,"This show in my opinon this show is a classic.  No matter how many times I watch it, it still is funny.  It actually is tied with another sit-com for my favorite of all time. It is not hard to find this show in reruns, however it makes you realize how much is actually edited out of the rerums when you watch the full versions on the DVD.  The only reason I only gave this 5th season four stars, instead of five, is b/c the character Carmen (played by Masiela Lusha) went off to college, and left the show.  I really was hoping she'd return for at least an episode here and there (like Kelly Fox did on ""Coach""), but she never did.  They added George and Angie's niece Veronica (played my Aimee Garcia) to the show.  They did keep quality story lines however.  I own all five seasons, and as this 5th season might be a tad below the previous four, it still is better than almost all of the sit-coms out there today,",1499212800,,915,4.194285714285714
