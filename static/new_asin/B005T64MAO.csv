4888215,5,B005T64MAO,"Menemsha Films, which earlier brought us the delightful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nora-s-Will/dp/B005AWEIP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nora's Will</a>, is releasing a remarkable new DVD: Inside Hana's Suitcase. What makes Hana Brady's story so remarkable in its reach is that this true story circles the globe: Hana's life story--nearly extinguished in the gas and flames of Auschwitz--winds up connecting children at a Holocaust educational center in Japan with the lives of the Brady family, who were devastated in the Shoah and later scattered to North America.

Most importantly, this is a pitch-perfect choice to use with children in educational programs about World War II, the Holocaust--or in classes with general themes on war, peace, remembrance and reconciliation. In fact, the core of this story involves a diverse circle of school children who narrate much of the movie. The Japanese group that began this global quest is dubbed The Small Wings. These were children who wanted to find a project that they and their teacher could undertake to help the world remember the Holocaust and the horrors of World War II. Along the way, a woman who is a Hiroshima survivor comes and helps at the educational center. Anyone familiar with educational efforts on these complex issues will be pleased to hear that the Hiroshima survivor also gives a pitch-perfect description to the children of the major differences between the horrors of nuclear bombing in 1945 and the Shoah. Clearly, someone with great experience in teaching these lessons had a strong hand behind the writing and final editing of this documentary.

THE BASIC STORY: A real-life Japanese schoolteacher, who appears throughout the film, sparked this entire story by gathering artifacts for a Holocaust educational center she was developing along with a group of girls and boys called The Small Wings. After applying to receive Holocaust artifacts, a large box arrives with a handful of artifacts, including a battered brown suitcase labeled with Hana Brady's name. The teacher and her students begin searching for the story behind the suitcase. What they discover will surprise you. They wind up unlocking--and showing us in the film--a whole series of deeply moving memories and other related artifacts and photos. Finally, Hana's surviving brother George travels to Japan to meet the Japanese students. Eventually, books about Hana--and now this documentary--circle the world to help children learn the real cost of unchecked horrors against humanity like the Shoah.",1322956800,10,2587,5.563451776649746
4888216,5,B005T64MAO,"For many people, the Holocaust is fading into the mists of time; many of its lessons are being dangerously forgotten. But every once in a while, a film or book or *story* comes along that *refuses* to allow us to forget. Inside Hana's Suitcase is one of those films. It's a hybrid of documentary and biographical drama that will hold the interest of any child elementary age and up. Using contemporary interviews and recreations, it draws us into Hana's world; and we become part of her suitcase of memory, if you will.  It gentles us into the story of Hana's short life; but it doesn't let us off the hook, either -- Hana's death was part of that life, too.

Inside Hana's Suitcase is a love letter to a life cut short by evil. It's also the fulfillment of the child Hana's dream to become a teacher: Hana's life teaches us that we *must* remember and we, too, must look into the suitcase of history even when what's inside is ugly -- especially, when what's inside is ugly. And after the DVD is over, we must remind our children and ourselves of *beauty* in Hana's story and how through this film and the story of her life, she teaches us and will continue to teach us for years to come.  We must teach our children that the act of *remembrance* is a powerful thing; and *because* of the power of memory, the lessons of Hana's life are every bit as real and important today as they were during the time of the Nazis.

Fans of the book *Hana's Suitcase* won't be disappointed by this film. Like the book, Inside Hana's Suitcase is an opportunity to teach young people about the Holocaust and the need to practice tolerance -- and of the necessity for each of us to stand up against injustice whenever we see it.",1311465600,4,1712,4.425396825396826
4888217,3,B005T64MAO,This is the story of a class in Japan that wanted to learn about the Holocaust. They received a suitcase that supposedly belonged to a young girl that was sent to one of the camps. The docu goes into detail of what they did with the suitcase once these received it and what the class learned. I was held back from giving it four stars because of what comes out about the suitcase toward the end. That was disappointing to me.,1400976000,,425,4.2592592592592595
4888218,5,B005T64MAO,Saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Glad it's available now for U.S. viewers. Powerful true story.,1397088000,,126,5.35
4888219,5,B005T64MAO,"I'm a 5th grade teacher and absolutely love using this book in my classroom. We read Number the Stars as a class and I use this particular book in a reading group that needs to be challenged. This year we ordered the dvd and the entire grade watched it (we all read Number the Stars, but only a small group of kids read Hana's Suitcase). So the movie brought everyone together to learn about this incredible story.

In 5th grade, we are careful to limit our Holocaust materials to those that do not show graphic images. We feel the kids are not ready yet, and we know they learn about it more in depth in 7th and 8th grades in our district. This book and movie met our criteria for focusing on an individual's experience without providing disturbing visuals.

Just like the book, the dvd is so well done!!! Thank you to all who made it possible for George and Fumiko to share their stories.",1395446400,10,890,4.387878787878788

4888223,5,B005T64MAO,"Based on a true story  - A Director of Holocaust Education Center in Japan receives a suitcase with the name 'Hanna' painted on the side of it.  Along with teaching children the meaning of tolerance and peace, the director works with the children to find out who owned the suitcase and what happened to Hanna.  She comes to find out Hanna's story through Hanna's brother, who is a Holocaust survivor.  The movie goes back in time as Hanna's brother explains what life was like prior to the devastating event, during the Holocaust and how he honors his perished family by leading a full life.

4888224,5,B005T64MAO,This is a very interesting documentary.  I would recommend it highly.  The fact that Hana's brother /is still alive brings to light just how important it is to tell all there is to tell about the Holocaust .,1372982400,,207,4.421052631578948

8485914,2,B005T64MAO,"I purchased this DVD to use in my Language Arts classroom. The students read the book as part of our Injustice Unit. I LOVE the documentary itself. The problem is the SECOND time I showed the DVD (to my second class of the day), it went crazy, and scenes from some other movie/video was playing (absolutely NOT related to Hana's Suitcase). I played it a THIRD time during my plan time, and it was ""normal"" like the first time I showed it. It makes me very hesitant to use the DVD since I do not know what will pop up in front of my students. :(",1517184000,,544,4.1415094339622645

Wonderfully put together, touching, very sad and yet inspiring.
