7007089,5,B00TGCIH0I,"It's great to see a movie with Sam Claflin where he doesn't die at the end. I loved this story of two people who obviously belong together and love each other but just don't get their timing figured out until  many years later. Lily Collins is adorable as always. The only problem with this movie, for me, is that there's a little bit too many F-bombs, but the British use that word a lot more than Americans do and don't think twice, so I just think of it as a cultural difference!",1509926400,,482,4.239130434782608

Also, just speak your mind about how you feel about your loved ones! They should always know you care. Such a good movie. I had to buy it.

7007142,5,B00TGCIH0I,"This is the biggest delightful surprise in a rom-com in a long time!  My daughter recommended it to me, telling me ""You have to see it!""  This is the kind of witty, cute, and endearing movie that I think only the Brits can make.  First off, you will fall in love with both leading actors, Lily Collins and Sam Claflin.
The story is that Rosie and Alex (Collins and Claflin) have been life long best friends.  They are cute, do everything together kind of friends, but you can see early on that their are feelings that go way deeper.  As they graduate high school and plan to go to Boston to start colleges and break free, Rosie gets pregnant by a lame guy she dated at their prom.  Not wanting to hold Alex back, she doesn't tell him and lets him go off to Harvard.  As their lives evolve and they keep missing each other's clues, there is a lot of very sweet and very funny things that happen along the way that always makes you know more than ever that they belong together.  This movie is at times laugh out loud funny, with humor that is borderline raunchy at times in that way that Brits can pull off that somehow never seems raunchy.  Then there are parts of the movie that are utterly sweet and will bring tears to your eyes.",1470268800,10,1232,4.275862068965517

I love Lily Collins and Sam Caflin as actors, ad you put them together and on this project and it's amazing.

The story is about 2 best friends that love each other, their love timing is off. Their love journey is relatable, I think everyone at some point has gone through something similar. It's a sweet, silly, and funy movie.

7007188,4,B00TGCIH0I,I would say that it doesn't particularly follow the book but since it was written as a series of letters it would be hard to show that in a film without it dragging. One thing was the two leading characters in my mind were in looks much as I imagined them. As a stand alone work it is good and for those who do not like to read the book will not have a problem understanding the film. I would recommend as long as it is not compared to the book.,1441152000,2,445,3.901098901098901

7007204,5,B00TGCIH0I,"Saw the preview for this and knew right away I'd love it... and I did.
A sweet (yet at times mildly frustrating for the viewer lol) romantic dramedy about Alex and Rosie -- two best friends who go through life together with a handful of missed opportunities of getting together.  Parts of this were crass so wouldn't recommend for younger audiences, but was a great movie with terrific actors (Finnick is in it!) and a lot of depth.
Also really LOVED Lily Collins -- she made Rosie come to life (esp. love all her reactions to situations she found herself in).  Definitely worth a watch as there haven't been many movies like this made... let alone in the past 5-10 years!  Want to read the book now and see how it compares....",1434758400,,727,4.492424242424242

If you like girly chick flicks like Nicolas sparks movies you will love this.

7007209,5,B00TGCIH0I,"I don't recall hearing of this movie before.  I was scrolling through movies on a rainy night and came upon this one.

It's a sweet tale of two best friends who actually grew to love each other but never talked about it.  They had wonderful plans to go to university abroad in Boston together, but, as usual... life got in the way.  They spent a little over a decade apart and had the worst luck with it came to timing.

Their chemistry is undeniable and it's truly a sweet story.

It did remind me a lot of a modern-day ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", but with a twist.",1431216000,,566,4.242990654205608
7007210,5,B00TGCIH0I,"SIMPLY BRILLIANT AND EARTHY -- ONE OF THE BETTER DRAMAS WITH COMEDY I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG WHILE

Though I would still call this a comedy (a romantic one by design), that is almost doing it an injustice.  It has so much more to offer.  The best of comedies make us both laugh and cry at the same time.  Though the situations can be very dramatic, this slice of life comedy manages to be a little more down to earth while also giving us laugh out loud moments.  If you allow it to develop, it's the drama that draws you in as these two human magnets facing the wrong way go through life trying to get it right.  Then it's the hilarious moments and ridiculously witty lines that bring it all home into a classic.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Rosie (Lily Collins) and Alex (Sam Claflin) have been best friends since childhood.  They do everything together and confide everything.  As they reach the end of high school days it is clear they each have feelings for each other secretly, but cannot risk revealing how each feels.  They help each other win boyfriends or girlfriends, prepare for the school dance, even discuss sex very frankly.  Underneath it all, it's still very clear to the viewer that it's all about them.  A moment of confused rejection for Alex compounds the issue.  However, as they both prepare for college they still plan a future that includes each other.  Sam wishes to go to America and study at Harvard to become a doctor.  He shares that idea with Rosie and explains she could easily go to Boston and study her dream of hotel management.  Rosie's father is a footman at a swanky hotel and they are not wealthy.  However, it is Rosie's dream to one day own and run a great hotel.  As they move forward, life has other ideas as girlfriends and boyfriends seem to complicate the picture.  They are friends above everything, and above everything something more.  Though the premise may sound cheesy and perhaps done a few times, the effort this movie throws into creating somewhat substantial and earthy drama raises it to a whole other level of quality.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  Obviously those who hate romantic or dramatic films are going to have a hard time.  But for those who love the genre, this is a great film.  Lily Collins and Sam Clafln are absolutely brilliant and have great chemistry in every way.  The supporting characters are hilarious and rich.  Though this movie has an R rating that will throw some prospective viewers off, that is mainly for some very frank and hilarious conversations that are somewhat life based, if a little dramatic.  It is not raunchy, but there are moments of intentional crassness (like life).  There is no nudity, though there is some implied sex and sexual situations.  I found the movie tremendously skillful at walking that line between being absolutely funny and yet moving at the same time.  If it sounds remotely interesting to you, I highly recommend giving it a try.",1425081600,20,2929,4.6400778210116735
