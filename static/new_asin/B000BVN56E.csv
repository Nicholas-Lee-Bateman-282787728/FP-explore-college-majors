8093278,2,B000BVN56E,"I recently saw this video posted on Youtube and I wanted to get the video so I could see it in DVD quality.  Sadly, this was nothing more than a poor (you can even see the video tracking marks!) videotape transfer to DVD.  The only good thing was the sound but the picture quality was very dull, pixelly with massive color bleeding!

The second disc which were full of the known clips was in a lot better quality and near to DVD quality.  I do realize that this disc was from 2003 and DVD was not THAT old, but the quality of DVD had developed enough to the point that nothing should have been transferred from a tape - you need to transfer from direct sources.  This is laziness or a rip-off.  This set could have value if they were to DIGITALLY REMASTER this and sold it again and it would not hurt to add even more footage.

A lot of the footage where Groden tells us to see someone in a window are unable to be seen due to the poor quality of the discs.  They made nice menus, but the feature presentation is piss poor.  Because of the quality I do not recommend this because you will have  a set not worthy or adding to a collection.  The content is good, but if you cannot see it clearly what is the point?  Oh yeah - I was watching on a 60"" HDTV upscaled on a Blu-Ray player!",1333584000,4,1282,4.104417670682731
