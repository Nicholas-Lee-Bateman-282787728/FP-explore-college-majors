7852197,4,6303640591,"I would have to say that this movie is all right as Shannon Tweed has a role of a cop. Knowing the kind of parts that she usually gets in almost all her movies as the deadly diva makes me her true admirer. Shannon always has her style cut out for her and she manages to please the audience with her positive energy depending on what role she is portraying. SHE'S JUST AWESOME, I LIKE HER.",1355443200,2,388,4.118421052631579
7852198,1,6303640591,Hard Vice (also known as Vegas Vice)is a cheap direct to video affair that is about cops chasing down a hooker who kills her customers. Now vice cops  Sam Jones (whom you might remember from the Flash Gordon film) and Shannon  Tweed are called to the case. Very cheesy and low budget making you feel  that you just wasted your time. You can thank director/producer/writer Joey  Travolta for making this garbage a reality.,966038400,,421,4.726027397260274
7852199,2,6303640591,"Hard Vice, an engrossing and sweeping film of Las Vegas nightlife, boasts a stellar cast and fine screenplay, but a poor and convoluted plot.  With great lines such as ""Damn girl, what'd ya do in that bathroom?"",  this film wastes its immense potential.  Shannon Tweed shines in this  quasi-hot flick as a homicide detective.  Her fine supporting castmates do  their best to bring nuance to their scandalously underdeveloped characters,  but overall this film is only average.  The biggest mistake in this film is  wasting the fine potentiality of scenes in the stunning Maxim and Arizona  Charlie's Hotels in Vegas.  Still, worth watching with your mother or  grandparent.",946252800,7,673,5.186915887850467
