You'll learn the art of making stain glass, travel to Seattle and explore the rich, diverse world  of cultural music and look into the world of a children's book illustrator.....Highly educational and fun.  Ideal for children 7 to 14 and great for adults as well. A must have!!!",1099785600,,340,5.053571428571429
8037733,4,B00062WUS2,"Whether it's stained glass in Chicago, the Womad Music Festival in Seattle,  or a visit with childrens' author Marcia Williams in London, this video magazine with youthful narration will appeal to children of all ages.  We hear Cuban music, reggae rhythms, Irish sounds with an African beat, and  taiko drums to stimulate our musical interests. The illustrated myth of Daedalus and Icarus, and music by Peter Gabriel finish a world-wide snapshot of art for the young viewer.",1098748800,,474,5.12987012987013
8037734,4,B00062WUS2,"""Rainbow Soup"" is terrific. I don't know what else to say. It's as interesting for kids as it is for adults. (My wife wants to figure out how to teach her class how to make ""stained glass"" windows, whereas I want to hear more from the Afro-Celt band).  Art, music, literature, diversity of culture and history; I can't imagine a kid could watch this and not find at least one topic they'd like to explore further. ""Rainbow Soup"" does everything that a children's show should do, but which most--in point of fact--don't.",1098748800,,519,4.641304347826087
