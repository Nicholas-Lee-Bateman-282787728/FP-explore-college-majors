Darryl just got out of the psych ward in his no name town.  His doctor sends him home, but warns him: no, Daryl, you are not cured. Not until hell is a giant frozen record shop. Be a bright boy: take the meds.

But  Derryl does save the life of a boy running into traffic. Mom owns a resturant, and is just plain nice. She lavishes praise on Darryl--thankful, platonic hugs and friendly pats on the shoulder included--and invites him for a free meal. Oh sweetie,  if you only knew who you were dealing with.

Darryl's mom, however, is not so nice. She makes fun of Darryl, who cannot form healthy adult relationships. ""What would she want with a twisted little freak like you?"" the old bat asks, as sonny boy stuggles with his tie, gesticulating with his hands.

Gee, why is poor Daryl soooo crazy? Bad childhood? Blame aside, he is; hook, line and Depakote. It takes him less than an hour to utterly misconstrue the situation. He tells mom he now has a real relationship, and within days, asks the restruant owner to marry him.

From here on out, it is classic horror formula, and lusiously so. Darryl hurls mommy down the stairs, scares the hell out of his new obsession, breaking into her house and ripping off his own thumbnail when he finally catches her 74th hint. He is so ill, he goes to a strip club, and hillucinates his wholesome love's head on one of the scuzzy dancers.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot: he also kills a few people he feels are in the way of his newfound lovefest. By now his ""girlfriend"" is terrified of him and after the classic stuggle........well, Darryl, BYE BYE.

Classic horror style is by definition  formula--the aliennated protagonist, the abusive mother, and the sweet as pie victim, displaced as the ideal mother/lover Derryl will never have. He wants her because she is unatainable. He doesn't even know her. She is his abstraction. This stuff goes back to early Hitchcock.

So you pretty much know what will happen, but watching the process is the fun: the distorted reality of the stalker, the murder of the abusive parrent, and the sweetheart victim having no choice but to kill. Extra twist: having to kill the guy who saved your kid, then having to live with the guilt. You can also sympathize with Derryl. He is not evil, just REAL sick. Still, you feel comforted  he is kaput.

Director Peter Jackson understands this at its essence. His screenplay  hits bullseye. No pyrotechnics, no hip-hop soundtrack, no reality TV spoofing for wisea-s teens, none of the marketing garbage that has modern commerical horror in such a sorry state.

Stalked is what horror should be. Why--because the same old shoes fit,  every time.",1249257600,,2868,4.636363636363637
