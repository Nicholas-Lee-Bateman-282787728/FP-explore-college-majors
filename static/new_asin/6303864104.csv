734856,2,6303864104,"After reading the book, the movie leaves a lot to be desired.  There were just way too many things left out of the movie.
The film did have an exceptional cast, and the acting was terrific.  I was somewhat suprised at  how well Matt Dillon play Jan Erlone.  The setting was pretty good too.  The scenery was put together nicely, as it did look like the  1940's.
Unfortunately, the editing from the novel made the film seem  quite choppy.  Having read the book, you got into the minds of the  characters, especially that of Bigger's.  The movie skipped over too many  things, not allowing you to do this, which was a fairly big letdown.
Not  reading the book might leave you with a different impression of the film,  because, once again, the acting is wonderful.  But, having read the book, I  couldn't enjoy the movie.  Way too many important scenes were taken out of  it.  It is really not a good adaptation.",964224000,2,909,4.506172839506172
734857,1,6303864104,"Well, after reading Native Son, I thought it would be a good idea to rent the movie to get visual of what happened in the book. Well, that was all I got out of this movie...
There wasn't anything wrong with the acting or  set, it was the script. They simply cut way too much out of the book. Here  are some examples:
-After Bigger killed Mary and they found the bones in  the furnace, Bigger ran from the house (as he did in the book), and then  all of a sudden he's on roof tops getting chased and then caught. In the  book he was on the run with Bessie for a few days and then he killed her.  -In the book, they had two inquests and in the movie they only had one...no  mention of Bigger fainting in the first inquest. -They completely cut out  the trial in the movie, only playing soundbytes. They only showed the  sentencing. In the book, Bigger's lawyer gave a 16 page statement on  Biggers behalf. -Bigger's mother (Oprah Winfrey) assumed the role of both  his mother and the priest in the movie.
Well, those are a few examples.  If I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have known what was going on in  Bigger's head, which was what made the book so good. I don't think Richard  Wright would be too impressed with this movie.",964051200,7,1228,4.214592274678112
7856249,3,6303864104,I love this story! I really do. I wish they would do a remake. Please don't leave anything out this time. The book was amazing. The film was pretty good but it didn't do the book justice. I really wish Spike Lee or Lee Daniels make this story know. Everyone should see this a least 1 time! This was more like an after school special.,1431388800,,333,4.138461538461539

7856253,4,6303864104,"Ive read the book and seen both film versions of the story, and I feel this movie was really quite good.  The book is deeper, but the actors redeem the film.  Victor Loves performance was phenomenal  he effectively conveyed a cycle of fear and abuse that underlie antisocial behavior.  There are certain events and political undertones of the novel that are not covered in this film, but I am guessing that the films producers wanted to maintain a PG rating, which would have been challenging:  e.g., treatment of Bessies murder,  motives behind Mr. Daltons philanthropy, and systemic bias.  Wright wrote this story when he was becoming disenchanted with the Communist party, and that was significant feature of the legal defense presented in the book.  Ideally, the movie could have been longer.",1407542400,,796,5.022900763358779
7856254,4,6303864104,"No, of course it doesn't do the novel justice, but it could be a lot worse. It could be as bad as Wright's own 1951 film version, but it's not. Great for the classroom as a way to move students through the novel more quickly.",1382140800,,225,4.022222222222222

7856256,3,6303864104,"I understand the perspectives of the other online-reviewers; however, being an English teacher, I have found this video to be quite beneficial and complimentary in assisting me and helping my students to understand the characterization and themes in Native Son.  It is not an outstanding performance; however,  it does offer a color cinematic version, while having actors that are recongnizable to a younger generation.

I do not believe that many outstanding novels can ever really be properly and accurately portryaed on film; that is really a daunting task for directors, writers, and producers.  To this date, I can only say that The Color Purple has actually achieved cinematic success, due in large part to the creative genius of Steven Spielberg.  That is a rarity.

However, I have been trying to find this movie for some time, and at last, I have found it.  It will be put to good use in my classroom.",1126310400,14,910,4.908496732026144
7856257,4,6303864104,"For starters this movie depicts everything that is detailed/explained in the original title ""Native Son"". I do not  know precisely which movie one of the previous  reviewers  from Decatur, Georgia was watching, but I can most definitely  assure that it was not Native Son.
The  cast performed almost as  good as the  cast members in the original story.  I  think the book and the video are an excellent combinational method for  those reading the  novel and attempting to visual  what the entire  concept of this  novel is all about.  In short I  think  the video is  well deserving of a  4 star rating.",1057968000,6,603,4.679611650485437
7856258,2,6303864104,"The cinematic presentation of Richard Wright's classic is  once again another flop. Although it is far better than the original adaptation of the book into a movie (filmed in 1949), it fails to capture the essence of Bigger Thomas. How can such a film with a star studded cast fail so miserably? After all, now you have actors who can really act!
  Native Son lacks passion. Bigger comes across as poor Black boy gone wrong with his cowardly behavior. His white liberal benefactors personalities are benign. Jan (Matt Dillon) just doesn't impress me as an ardent communist. Mary Dalton ( Elizabeth McGovern) comes across as a bubble head. Even Oprah Winfrey's begging plea to let her son live, is a sham. Where is the political and heated fervor of the era? John Karlen's role as Max, the lawyer for Bigger, was a waste of time. He wasn't convincing as a passionate lawyer out to save this oppressed black boy.
  Most film adaptations of books fall short in staying true to the author's story. This second adaptation falls through period. I found it a great disappointment in the acting as well as the script. Someday, somehow, some one will do this great novel justice and present us with a blockbuster film filled with not only passion but with a sense of what formed this Native Son. I recommend this movie to put in your video archive along with its original version.",976752000,7,1371,4.695833333333334
