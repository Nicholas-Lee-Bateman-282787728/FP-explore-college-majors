6140085,5,B00H7YYMOM,"This was better than i thought it would gave been. Robin G. portrayal of a loving, example was very convincing. The children actors reflected of how kids their age are today but with a willingness to take heed of their mom's wishes to be a better person. Loved the fact that the vocalizing of Jesus was a reality in the storyline.  Scriptures were interjected, performance by the guest singing group in the church was uplifting and giving God the glory is a reality. Have to admit this was better than ""God's Not Dead"" because it has more continuity and substance and not an over done of wasteful film footage. Bravo to the screen writer(s), director, and producer to break the barrier that God is always in control.",1462665600,7,716,4.637795275590551

8630693,3,B00H7YYMOM,"A low budget religious flick. I bought it for the familiar-faces.
The acting was a little stiff, but the heart was in the right place.
There's more positive than negative in this. The angels' wings
could've used a little work, but, other than THAT the only thing
I disliked is even with my 65"" TV, the end credits were almost
too small to read.",1521763200,,344,4.390625
8630694,3,B00H7YYMOM,"This was ok. Better choice for a family movie than many others. My kids enjoyed it for the most part, but the believes were not accurate to what we believe as Christians. Although the believe in God is there, the rest was just something I had to explain to my kids as it's just a movie.",1519689600,,286,4.125
