8621626,5,B00GAOM56C,lots of fun! had a travel channel vibe to it but better..  no commercials!  bought this and disc 1 on a whim after coming across it.  have not been disappointed.  if you're interested in off roading in southern africa...  well worth it! waiting patiently for more in this series.,1413676800,,279,4.612244897959184
