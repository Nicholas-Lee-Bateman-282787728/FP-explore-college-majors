2696632,5,B000KNN9KK,"Four middle-aged men in Iran are driving from a ski trip, pull over for a bathroom break, see a huge boulder on a cliff, and decide to push it over the edge - the story is as simple as that.  It sounds so silly for some guys to decide to do this and spend so much time on it but you understand it as a part of human nature.  Sometimes you just feel a need to do something and can't move on until the task is done.  The rock on the cliff is compelling enough, and I spent the entire movie truly wishing that they could push it over, even if just to see what (if anything) would happen.  In the course of the day, the men are joined by other people passing through who join there cause (or sell a donkey to it).  The film was inspired by an idea from Abbas Kiarostami and it reminded me of one of his films, Close-Up; both stories explore men going to far lengths to do something that doesn't seem wise or useful to do.  It's about the nature of people to do what they are compelled to do, even if it makes no sense.  And yes, it's just plain silly.",1307577600,,1047,3.9808612440191387
2696633,3,B000KNN9KK,"""Men at Work"" is a film from Iran that focuses on four friends.  While travelling in a mountainous region within driving distance of Tehran, they stop for one of the group to relieve his bladder.  A striking stone rock oddly sticks out by the side of the road.  The men's imaginations are captured by the rock; and they assume the mission of trying to push it over and down the cliff.  The stone will not budge.  In the course of the afternoon, a number of other people drop by.  An old man whose donkey is purchased to help in the effort reluctantly sells his animal.  Two women that the men know arrive; and we learn part of the social history of the friends.  Several groups on a ski trip join the effort, eventually tying a winch and metal rope to their SUV and trying to pull it over.  The metal cable snaps and injures one of their crew.  One friend stubbornly refuses to leave, even to get his friend medical attention.  The film ends with three driving away & coming back to give their friend his coat & hot coffee.  This is an open-ended film.  One wonders why they try so hard to push over a rock on a mountain road in the middle of nowhere.  It's part road picture, part male bonding picture.  In the end, not much happens.  The film is more of a snapshot of a strange day in the lives of these characters.  Director Mani Haghighi makes a decidedly non-political film about a group of friends.

The short film on the disc is ""Hold Up"" about a woman who persuades her fiancee to hold up a convenience store.  Director Madelein Olnek provides good pacing on this quick 6-minute short film.  An unusual reversal during the robbery occurs that ties the film together.

The Iranian mountain scenery in ""Men at Work"" is exceptional.  The film has won Best Film @ Traverse City Film Festival, official selection @ Berlin Film Festival, Singapore International Film Festival & Tribeca Film Festival.  While I enjoyed the scenery and the whimsical nature of these Iranian friends, the film was not riveting.  Enjoy.",1173398400,11,2017,4.538888888888889
8158410,3,B000KNN9KK,"I disliked another Iranian film, but gave that nation another chance. And this one worked, even if this movie is essentially absurdist, or at least symbolic.

Four middle-aged men are driving back along a mountain road from a ski trip that didn't work out, gossiping and mocking each other the whole time. One has to stop to urinate, and when they do, they notice a vertical rock formation they all decide to try to tip off the edge of the cliff it is a part of. When their efforts initially fail, they buy a donkey from an old man, and when that fails, they come up with more and more absurd plans to make it finally move. Never mind that they were supposed to go home and watch an important soccer game. And other people start coming by, including their relatives. Not all the movie's time is spent on the attempts to move the rock; the cast talk and argue about their families and friends and workmates.

Perhaps this movie means far more to Iranians than anyone else; the whole premise is obviously symbolic, though we don't necessarily understand what exactly was being symbolized. Politics? Religion? Mere personal relationships? Still it is mildly amusing to watch.",1525132800,,1172,4.684466019417476
8158411,4,B000KNN9KK,"Four middle-aged Iranian guys are driving home from a ski trip and stop at the side of the road to pee.  One of them notices a tall, thin rock formation standing by itself at the edge of a sheer drop.  It seems like they should be able to push it over, so they try.  That's the movie.  They go to increasingly absurd lengths to try and knock over the damn rock.  I think it actually says something pretty profound about people ... men in particular.",1486425600,,449,4.235294117647059
8158412,4,B000KNN9KK,"The only way to make sense of otherwise intelligent men and women working so hard to topple a stupid rock is to imagine that the men and women stand for the modern, cosmopolitan Iranian people and the rock, which ""has no roots,"" stands for the theocracy.

Does the old man and his donkey represent the rural conservative supporters of the theocracy? Is the donkey being led away by two young women a way of saying it will be Iran's females who will convert the backward men of their country?

After an injury in the attempt (foretelling the 2009 demonstrations?), after all the men and women have left, one man remains, refusing to give up at what now seems an impossible, quixotic effort. He labors alone in the dark and cold until finally persuaded his effort is futile. And then the rock, though having withstood all previous efforts and appearing to never be toppled, does indeed fall over, as if by itself, as if mentally willed, like the bending spoon mentioned earlier in the film.

Is this film an allegory or is this American dunderhead reading too much into it?

Which is why my rating is 4 stars. If the film is indeed about current Iranian politics, it's brilliant and deserves an enthusiastic 5 stars. If it's not, if it's just an Iranian Seinfeld, only 3. Four splits the difference, because I don't know.",1483401600,,1319,4.648068669527897

8158414,5,B000KNN9KK,"A delightful film about how passion (obsession)  can develop in moments as the time is ripe.  About friends and all their quirks.  From Iran, filmed in the high mountains, very beautiful and not one mention of Allah or Islam.  This is a film with universal appeal, we know these people very well.",1468800000,,296,4.634615384615385
8158415,5,B000KNN9KK,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though it was in subtitles. It stays with you, and portrays Iranians as diverse and immersed in the human condition like anyone else.",1444176000,,170,4.896551724137931
8158416,3,B000KNN9KK,"We picked this movie because it looked lonely and unwatched on Amazon Instant Watch. As it turns out, we rather wish we had left it alone.

* Odd.  Potentially psychological but as movies go, rather plotless.

* Somewhat slow-moving.  It does progress from point to point but we had to skip about the middle 30 minutes to make it tolerable.

* If you don't need a story and want a movie that concentrates on personal connections then this might be for you.

PS: I hope my review was helpful. If it was not, then please let me know what I left out that youd want to know. I always aim to improve.",1419724800,,595,4.267857142857143
8158417,3,B000KNN9KK,"This is a rather quirky and roughly hewn film, which can be rather funny if you watch it with no preconceptions, and take more interest in the characters than in the plot.  The story pretense, is absurd, as advertised. Is it political? This must be obvious to Iranians. But life goes on around the four guys at the center of the story, in spite of the seemingly pointless obsession with the rock.  Three of my friends watched this, and it didn't make much sense to them. The second time I watched it, I focused on the characters and fragments of their lives, artfully rendered as background to the rock. I still thought the camera work improved in the second half. Women in the story seemed peripheral to the lives of the men, although one of them who made a stronger impression, simply by being beautiful and traditionally deferential. Strangers who passed through the story randomly added texture and amusing moments. This film is absurd like some of the people whom we meet every day, who don't always pay attention to what is most important in their lives.",1405382400,,1060,4.663101604278075
8158418,1,B000KNN9KK,"The plot (what there is) is nonsensical. For no apparent reason, a group of friends decides to topple a curbside rock. Alright, I can believe they might give this a shot for fun or to pass the time if stranded. But they spend HOURS on it when they could just leave! Is this some deep reflection on the pointlessness of life? It is certainly NOT a comedy as it is billed. I can't actually comment on the whole thing since I could only sit through the first half. But even if it improved significantly (which I doubt), the terrible build up is unredeemable.",1371081600,,555,4.398058252427185
8158419,4,B000KNN9KK,"The central idea that these men find they MUST push a rock over the edge of a cliff speaks volumes about human nature. The characters are also somewhat interesting but there is no great drama in their lives or the story other than finding they cannot move forward in live without pushing a rock they had never seen before over a cliff. The very lack of central drama leads the viewer to philosophical questioning and the subtle storyline does not really seek to interrupt that. I really appreciate it when a film does this, especially when filmed so beautifully.",1348185600,,562,4.686868686868687
