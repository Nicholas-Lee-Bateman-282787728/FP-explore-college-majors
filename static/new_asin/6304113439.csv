The ethical problems have, if anything, gotten worse. If you ever thought about getting mixed up in the modern surrogacy thing, watch this film first.",1469923200,,325,4.927272727272728

7861987,5,6304113439,"I am going to be a dad via gestational surrogacy this coming April 2013! Watching this movie scared me, made me wonder about what would happen if the surrogate changed her mind.... Surrogacy is a grey area of the law, many countries either have no law, or only have case law, or prohibit or legalize with restrcitions.
Nothing is uniform from place to place, so entering into a surrogacy agreement is scary, but know that if you researched the clinic/agency/provider and they have a good track record, your probably in good hands.  Never choose a surrogate who is doing this for only financial reasons, that can be part of the reason, but not the whole reason, altrusim is a big part of surrogacy.
I have worked with a surrogate in the USA and Abroad.  In my opinion, traditional surrogacy should be totally stopped.... all surrogacy should be done where the surrogate has no biological connection, and I think that one country has is all down pat- India. They have their process down to a science and it works.  Some might say, India, no way, but as a parent to be, the seperation that India requires will prove fruitful in the end.  Bonding with a surrogate will only complicate things when you become the parent and she becomes a friend.  NEVER work with family or known persons.  Keep things simple, private, use a mediator. This may sound cruil at first, but once you watch Baby M, it will make sense.",1353974400,,1406,4.626506024096385
7861988,5,6304113439,"I have always liked this movie.  This story is about a couple for New Jersey wanted so much to have a child they would do anything to have it happen.  Bill and Betsy Stern couldn't have their own natural child do to Betsy's medical condition.  I can't understand why people where so hard on Betsy that she didn't want to risk her health to try to have a baby.  If the risk was faced with anyone, i believe anyone would feel the same way.  I believe that Mary Beth Whitehead started off with good intentions, but she did so many horrible things to the family after the baby was born.  The Sterns tried so hard to help her and even gave the baby to her for ""one week"" But she never attended to return the baby to the Sterns and fled to Florida and didn't contact them for weeks, according to the movie. When the Sterns finally got the baby back, they had to go through a horrible court case.  So, I recommend watching this movie.  The way I would summ up this movie is a quote that is in the movie near the end.  ""Everyone talks about mother's rights, What about Father's rights??""",1251936000,2,1079,4.25
7861989,2,6304113439,"I just watched this movie recently for the first time in many years. As you may know, ""Baby M"" is the story of a suburban home-maker (Mary Beth Whitehead) who decided to be a surrogate mother for an affluent professional couple from Tenafly (Betsy & William Stern.) But after the birth of her daughter (named Sara Whitehead by her mother, Melissa Stern by her biological father, and otherwise known as ""Baby M"") Mary Beth knew that she could not part with her own flesh and blood.

I found this movie to be very biased and favorable only towards the allegedly-infertile couple. The performance of JoBeth Williams (portraying Mrs. Whitehead, now Mrs. Gould) was somewhat over-the-top. It was like she became this hysterical, screaming zombie after her baby was born and the producers did nothing to explain this sudden transformation.

If you are interested in finding out the facts about Baby M (unfortunately there is very little info on the Internet about this case as it predates the 90's and was overall a local story that was mostly watched in the suburban NY area) then I would certainly recommend reading: A Mother's Story by Mary Beth Whitehead.

This movie was originally produced as a two-part miniseries for ABC TV. It was originally shown in two, two hour blocks during two different days of the week (in 1988.) It has since been shown on Lifetime TV and is now on home-video. Please know that this home-video is the full-length movie, 3 hours and 14 minutes total (it includes the original opening and closing credits for both of the 2 hour TV movies, and also includes sections for commercials that state ""place commercial here"" these are inserted for about 5 seconds or less.) This film also includes performances by: Dabney Coleman (as the Stern's attorney), Brian Austin Green (as Mary Beth Whitehead's son), John Shea (as William Stern), and Jenny Lewis (as Mary Beth Whitehead's older daughter.)

The Baby M saga is very interesting because at the time it made history and set a standard. It also depicts the harmful bigotry that plague middle-class families in this country. Unfortunately this telepic does not delve into any of the socioeconomic and social bias that Mary Beth and her husband and family were the collective victims of.",1180656000,2,2256,4.897905759162303
7861990,1,6304113439,"Where do you begin with this film. It is the perfect example of why ""based on a true story"" can be so misleading. This film was made before the court issues were even completely resolved and was rushed out to capitalize on an incredible and important court case. The acting is putrid and there are an incredible amount of inaccuracies. The filmmakers obviously had a slant toward the Stern's and never fairly represented Ms. Whitehead's point of view. The $2.50 they are asking for this film is $7 too much since you will have to pay shipping. Avoid this unless you love horrific B-Rated made for TV garbage.",1126569600,3,608,4.638888888888889
