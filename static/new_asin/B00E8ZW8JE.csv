The art work elegantly and skillfully renders the drama, and the musical score is incredibly beautiful.  I bought it for my grand-daughter, who is sure to enjoy watching and listening to it again and again.  I have gotten to know the complex and brave Herschel and the sensitive people who care for him. You can almost touch his soft fur and hear his thoughts throughout this tale!",1382572800,,467,4.602409638554217
