8326614,4,B000NVI2D8,"I thought this was very good book, well writion, very relatible even if you haven't delt with a autistic child. I always enjoy animal storys but this one had extra enjoyment in it, to see how one speshil dog could help a kid relate to life, & endure hardships so much better by just showing pationts & love.",1371340800,,307,4.310344827586207
8326615,1,B000NVI2D8,The video does not work.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! We were thinking of getting our autistic grandson a dog for the reason in this video.  Saw the movie several years ago and wanted to use it to help in fundriasing for a trained dog.  Video does not work.  Not worth sending back for a 5.00 video.!,1351555200,,296,4.425925925925926
