In 2015 I travel to Miami to watch one of most relevant, creative and amazing artist of today. This performance recorded in Montreal Canada (two nights) captures the magic of that night In Miami.
Audience was amazing and if you, like me, don't understand French (yes his music and art are so powerfull, unique and rich that transcends lenguage) English subtitles are available in stromae's typeface (nice touch)
Cmara direction, audio recording and mix are top notch. If you are a Stromae fan this is a most in your collection.
The only thing missing is any bonus material. No behind the scenes, photos, interviews or nothing.
Still, a 5 star bluray for me.
Enjoy",1453248000,2,675,4.878260869565217
