2750418,3,B000MV9O4U,"I must have been sentimental when I ordered this.  Wanting to share some ""good old classics"" with my preteen children, I was excited to view the three musicals with them.  Gigi should be banned for girls - and boys, as a matter of fact (what were they thinking??); My Fair Lady is entertaining and a classic but not a favorite with my 6-year-old.  The only one I truly want to keep and see again is ""Singing in the Rain"", a story with some value - and the approval of all my kids.",1230336000,2,480,4.195652173913044
2750419,1,B000MV9O4U,"Very disappointing.  We didn't even watch all of it.......would return for a refund if I could.  It's nothing but advertisements of the movies,lots of print (telling it's in what kind of color, extravaganza, etc.)  Boring!  It had VERY brief segments from different movies.  I thought there would be some complete movies, not just segments.  The cover even shows 6 specific movies!!",1219622400,7,382,5.180327868852459

2750426,3,B000MV9O4U,"I had never seen any of these films before. While looking for ""Singin' in the Rain"" I came across this package. Each movie came in its own DVD and I was able to watch each film with no inconvenience. They all worked.

I discovered that musicals can be different. ""Singin'"" was singing and dancing all the way to the end. It is as dynamic as ""An American in Paris."" The lyrics to the songs were uplifting and added to the cheerful atmosphere of show business presented here, or reflected the mood of the characters (like the songs ""Good Morning! Good Morning!"" and ""Singin' in the Rain."" Dancing, however, was an essential part of the movie. By the way, this movie is about the problems a studio and its two major star undergo during the transition from the silent movie to the talkie (after the Jazz Singer becomes a success). When Don Lockwood and Lina make their first talkie, the premiere turns into a disaster and Don suffers an existential crisis. This can only be solved by turning the failed movie into a musical. Only one problem is left: Lina ( ""she can't sing, she can't dance...). Comedy and romance mix together with the music to create a great picture story. This film deserves 5 stars.

 ""My Fair Lady"", has a lot of singing, but very little choreography is required in this type of film; although the actors moved while they were singing. Each song was fun to listen to: it added humor to the story. I just read a book about languages and dialects, so I found funny that Rex Harrison could determine where each person came from just by listening to his or her speech (a predecessor to his Dr. Dolittle, I guess). In this film, a linguist teaches a flower seller from the streets to speak like a duchess only to win his bet, but having succeeded in his linguistic experiment, he has a hard time discovering that other feelings toward Eliza Dolittle have evolved. Overall, the film is enchanting because of the music, songs, and settings. Nevertheless, its musical style and the romance within it is as restrained as the society's manners being criticized. Not only does the proper speech that the Doctor in languages attempts to eradicate from Eliza is devoid of feeling and spontaneity, but also the professor's feelings toward his pupil seem too restrained. The second part of the film does weaken, I believe; it loses its dynamism. The film never hints at any romance between its two major characters although the film moves toward romance after Intermission. In spite of its minor flaws, the film is enjoyable. This film deserves 3 stars.

""Gigi,"" I thought, was different from the rest because this one had no choreography. And the singing was closer to speech than what we listen to in ""My Fair Lady."" At times, I felt that Leslie Caron wanted to dance, but she only limited herself to stretching out her arms. Actors were always restrained while singing. I wonder if this was done on purpose, given that the film is about ""love"" restricted to certain social boundaries, as Gigi learns to become a courtesan (without knowing it). For this reason, and for the fact that the story has few scenes showing any love developing between Gigi and her frequent visitor, I didn't like this film as much as the first two. I even thought that there was no reason to make it a musical; the story didn't make it urgent. I still remember the young man repeating ""It's a bore"" as something annoying. I also believed that Leslie Caron's appearance didn't let her show her charms as in ""An American in Paris,"" where she looked and acted more innocent. All this, of course, is a matter of opinion. I know it won oscars. I just didn't care about this story. The other thing I didn't like was this DVD edition. It was formatted to fit the TV screen, but it was the first time that I had the impression that sometimes the image was cut off in the formatting. I've never complained about this, but it is the first time that I have noticed it. This film deserves 1 star.

Anyhow, if you enjoy musicals, you are getting a great bargain from this collection.",1332547200,,4052,4.606648199445983
2750427,3,B000MV9O4U,"Movie arrived bundled with a few others. I was most excited about getting to watch ""Singin' in the Rain"". Unfortunately that movie did not work. My dvd player sat and spun trying to read the disk, but when I tried to play ""Gigi"" and ""My Fair Lady"" it read the disks and began playing them. I'm upset that it doesn't work but I don't want to return the whole set because one disk doesn't work.",1321833600,3,392,4.24
2750428,3,B000MV9O4U,Three separate discs with each of the musicals on a separate disc.  The one we wanted and chose to view first was Singin in the Rain.  It would not work.

2750431,5,B000MV9O4U,"These three time-honoured musical classics deserve a space in every DVD collection.  With stars like Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron and Audrey Hepburn, lush production values and memorable music, they'll be assured of giving your family hours and hours of solid movie entertainment.

MY FAIR LADY:
Rex Harrison ""grows accustomed to the face"" of Audrey Hepburn in the magical film version of the smash hit Broadway musical.  Despite an ill-fitting singing voice provided by ghost dubber Marni Nixon, Hepburn glows as the Cockney guttersnipe who blooms under the guidance of a stuffy professor (Rex Harrison reprising his stage role).

Special features: audio commentary with film restoration experts James Katz and Robert Harris, art director Gene Allen and singer Marni Nixon; theatrical trailer.

SINGIN' IN THE RAIN:
The beloved musical classic built around the Arthur Freed/Nacio Herb Brown songbook, detailing the various trials and trevails that ensued when the ""Talkies"" took over silent Hollywood.  Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds romance, whilst Donald O'Connor performs his tour-de-force ""Make 'Em Laugh"".

Special features: audio commentary hosted by Debbie Reynolds, and theatrical trailer.

GIGI:
The last big hurrah of the MGM musical stars Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan in a lush adaptation of Colette's famed novella.  Filmed on location in Paris by director Vincente Minnelli and featuring some of the most lavish costumes ever created by legendary Cecil Beaton, GIGI deservedly walked away with the 'Best Picture' Academy Award in 1959.

Special features: theatrical trailer.",1247270400,4,1586,5.570833333333334

2750433,5,B000MV9O4U,"The ""Essential Classics"" are aptly named, this is a great little collection of feel good movies that many of us saw with our parents (or in some cases with our grandparents).  Given the current economy and instability in our world, this is a bit of escapist fare that lets us all go back to a simpler time - if only for a while.  So, pour yourself a nice glass of wine, throw another log on the fire, turn down the lights, and sit back and enjoy a lighter moment in time.

The discs are well done, and the music brings back a lot of yesterdays.  Would that they (Hollywood) could return to making a few good musicals again.",1233532800,2,623,4.254237288135593
