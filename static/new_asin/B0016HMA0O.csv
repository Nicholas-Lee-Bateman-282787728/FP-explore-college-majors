8262555,5,B0016HMA0O,"This is a fun, beginners look into making rubber face masks. It talks a lot about items in a kit that is no longer available, however the items needed are very easily obtainable. I've been making masks for almost 20 years and so there was really no new information here for me, however that's not why I bought this dvd. I got it, mainly, for the nostalgia and because Ed Edmunds is an incredible mask maker and I wanted to peek at his technique. Lol. All in all, it's a fun introduction into simple face mask creation. I enjoyed it and think you will too.",1406332800,2,555,4.295238095238095

8262557,4,B0016HMA0O,"Pros.
The product was very professional and went at a good pace.
I learned something in the painting section, and now feel comfortable making clay/plaster setups.

Cons
He only covered full face masks, would have been nice to get his skill on open mouth face mask or half masks where you want to keep both eyes and mouth areas for an actor. Also didn't cover integrating Hair or other items to the mask.

certainly worth adding to your training material, but you will need more for pro work.",1389571200,3,491,4.568181818181818
8262558,5,B0016HMA0O,"With THIS DVD's contents, you can manufacture your own mask for Hallowe'en.
Like a lot of things, you can always do a better job with a third and fourth hand---
unless you are playing solitare, of course.

I fix MYSELF up for Halloween, regularly. I started l-a-t-e in life because I ""wasted""
most of my adult life in the military. Now --- see my Profile Photo --- at the ripe OLD
age of 64, after a couple hours, transform myself from 6'4"" to a seven-foot blue-guy!
