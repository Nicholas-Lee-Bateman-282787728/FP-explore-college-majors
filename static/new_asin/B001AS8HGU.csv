8279356,5,B001AS8HGU,"This DVD is professionally presented, comprehensive, yet easy for the beginner to understand, and an efficient use of time.
The sessions are short enough to complete before a day in the office, or a good wind-down after work.
It is a great introduction to the internal arts.
My breathing has  noticeably improved and my energy has felt more in balance since practising the exercises on this disc, Tibetan Qi Gong - disc one by Master Ron Lew.  I recommend it for everybody and especially anybody interested in improving their health and well-being.",1220227200,10,548,4.945652173913044
