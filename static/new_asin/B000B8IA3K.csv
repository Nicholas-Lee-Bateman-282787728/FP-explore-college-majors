2409117,1,B000B8IA3K,"There is only one reason to buy this repackaging of these three films - 'And Now for Something Completely Different', which is not available in a better presentation.  Both the versions of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' are the worst possible presentations of these films available on video. In fact, 'Baron Munchausen' is the fist time that I have seen a wide screen film presented on DVD that was culled from a pan and scan video edition, re-framed as letterbox and then mastered to anamorphic.  In this era of digital re-mastering in high definition for presentation in anamorphic as the de-facto standard for DVD releases, this edition is a travesty.

Don't buy it.",1200787200,97,713,4.925
2409118,5,B000B8IA3K,"I was really only interested in getting the Adventures of Baron Munchausen when I purchased this.  Amazon didn't carry it separately.  However, getting this box set was less expensive than any of the 3rd party sellers were selling it stand alone for.",1199577600,,250,4.928571428571429
2409119,5,B000B8IA3K,"I've always loved the zany, silly, never-fully-serious, antics of Monty Python's Flying Circus, and to get a boxed set of 3 DVD's for less than $20.00 was a major find (in my not-so-humble opinion). What MP does so well is take the everyday boring routine of life and turn it upside down and inside out, by means of pure unadulterated silliness. They find ingenious ways to ""poke fun"" at everything, but somehow manage to do it in such a way that its virtually impossible to be offended by it.

The first volume in the set, ""And Now For Something Completely Different, contains the best of their hit BBC TV Show from the early 1970's ""Monty Python's Flying Circus."" The various bits and sketches are still every bit as funny today as they were then.

The second volume was their first feature film: ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" takes a peculiar and perverse look at the King Arthur myth and his quest to find the most holy of cups in all the world. There is so much levity, parody, and satirical wit in this one film that its destined to remain a classic for some time to come.

The third volume contains ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a more recent release written by one of the members of the original group. If the movie ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" were to be mugged, then get run over by a bus, two cars, and a motor scooter, it might be close to the content in this movie.

I realize that MP is not for everyone. Not everybody enjoys their witty repertoire, but for those die-hard fans who find their unique brand of irreverent humor enjoyable, this is a must-have, and this three-in-one package deal makes it a bargain to boot.",1191456000,6,1648,4.483333333333333
2409120,5,B000B8IA3K,"My dad loved Holy grail so much he actually bought the vhs, in around 1995. Now some of you would say, thats not a big deal? WEll for my dad, buying a movie when you had a tv (hbo none the less) was like going fishing with a freezer full of fish, It just didn't add up. But this movie was so great and hilarious he caved and bought it. Well now we are in this Dvd era and soon to be something else, so i decided to buy this movie on Dvd. And i saw this great deal with the tv show and a sort-of random add in movie. The ANFSCD is classic, but most of my friends do not find Monty Python funny. Yet they also did not like Clerks I, so do not take their judgment too seriously (or rationally). WEll to the point, MP & the HG + ANFSCD are great and worth the price. Then they add in a almost-as-funny movie, that just sealed the deal.",1173484800,,831,3.865497076023392
2409121,4,B000B8IA3K,"Our son wanted The Adventures of Baron Munchausen for Christmas.  This was the only way (boxed set of three, and we already own The Holy Grail)to get a copy.  Service from Amazon was amazing, as usual.  Overall, not a bad deal for the price.",1169078400,3,241,4.431818181818182
2409122,5,B000B8IA3K,"If you are a fan of Monty Python, this is a must have.  The Holy Grail is quite possibly the funniest movie ever made and Something Completely Different is a collection of skits that includes the Funniest Joke Ever Told, Hell's Grannies, and the famous Parrot skit.  The three movies are all on separate discs in the thinner DVD cases so it isn't even as bulky as most boxed sets.  Overall, no Monty Python fan's library is complete without this set.",1168473600,2,450,4.530864197530864
2409123,5,B000B8IA3K,I have to say that anything to do with Monty Python craziness is absolutely hilarious.  I've even heard rumors that Jacqueline Kennedy as First Lady adored Monty Python and would invite friends to the White House to watch their movies.,1168300800,2,235,4.875
2409124,5,B000B8IA3K,"Monty Python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever. They made a tv show, Monty Python's Flying Circus, and several hilarious movies.

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

Their first movie, which is a collection of their best skits from their tv show. This movie is hilarious. It includes The Lumberjack Song, The Dead Parrot Sketch, The Dirty Fork, and the World Funniest Joke.

MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL

Their best movie. It's about Arthur and his knights looking for the Holy Grail. This movie will make you laugh insanely. Funny moments include The Killer Rabbit, The Knights Who Say Ni, and The Black Knight.

THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN

This movie is not a Monty Python film but was made by Terry Gilliam and co-stars Eric Idle, both of whom are former Pythons.

A must have for any Monty Python fan.

This set deserves the five stars and more. I recommend this to any Monty Python fan, British Comedy fan, or comedy fan in general. Too bad it didn't inlude The Meaning Of Life or Life Of Brian.",1136160000,31,1034,4.6740331491712706
2409125,5,B000B8IA3K,This was a gift for my teenage son.  He loves Monty Python & this had all the movies he wanted included.  It came quickly and he loves it.,1392336000,,138,3.892857142857143
2409126,4,B000B8IA3K,"Fans of the show(Flying Circus) as well any movies they may have seen and liked in the past will like this set. The gang do their clever/wackiest in bringing about just about every possible life situation,reacted to in their hilarious romp. They bring out the down side of medevel ways literally,in a comical way that is ironically pretty factual. Other weird situations,such as a knight fighting a giant penguin on the beach can be seen here. The sexual situations are met in a bobbling sense that will have your sides ache. Some of this is a little too far fetched in the warped sense,but most all is well worth viewing,many times!",1355184000,,633,4.711711711711712

2409128,5,B000B8IA3K,I bought this because I have enjoyed Monty Python movies in the past and wanted a copy of The Holy Grail. Before this I have never seen The Adventures of Baron Muchausen and was a little leery about this movie but I must confess I loved it. I definitely recommend these movies.,1256774400,,277,4.346153846153846
2409129,1,B000B8IA3K,"The ""Monty Python Box Set"" contains only three DVDs.  One of the DVDs isn't even a Monty Python movie.  Replace it with ""The Life of Brian"" or something Monty Python actually DID.

This is stupid.",1251244800,10,196,4.542857142857143
2409130,5,B000B8IA3K,"Well actually one film is not a Python film(Baron) but it is direced by Terry Gilliam and has some Python members in it!!! The other two(...Completely Different and Holy Grail) and absolute classic Python gems!!! A great set for the python fan!!! But beware that these are single disc bare bones releases(but they ARE anamorphic widescreen so that is a plus) so don't expect much in the line of extras,but it's a great buy if you can find it a low price,I hate paying full price!!! I'd problably give this set actually 3.5 stars due to the lack of extras,but heck it's Monty Python and it gets the full five stars!!! Absolute classic British comedy!!!

2409132,5,B000B8IA3K,"Monty Python is one of the funniest groups of movies and TV shows ever! and this Box Set is more than worth the small price for these 3 movies!!! The Holy Grail is one of the coolest, funniest, most enjoyable movies ever! Baron Muchausen is cute, not the best ever, but it is cute and along with Holy Grail and Now For Something Completely Different, this is a great Box Set, for anyone who loves comedy, and especially for anyone who is a fan of Monty Python!!!

I recomend to all!!!",1206230400,,484,4.318681318681318
