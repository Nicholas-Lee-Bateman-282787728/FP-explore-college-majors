I got to say he is very funny. He had me laughing all the way through his stand up. If you enjoy Latino Comedians, I definitely recommend you watch his stand up.. 5 Starras!!!! mix966fmdotcom",1459209600,,358,4.698412698412699

5656092,5,B00BMXT8M0,Some comedians come out strong on their first special but fizzle on their second - not Willie Barcena.  Just as funny as his first special and just as truthful.,1401235200,,160,4.517241379310345

8571179,5,B00BMXT8M0,"The show is mostly about married life. Not for prudish, but really funny. I've got to say I didn't know the comedian before watching the show, so it was a good surprise.",1514246400,,169,4.3125
8571180,3,B00BMXT8M0,"I Laughed hard and down to my toes about his jokes on religion and church's.  Then, like most men he spent entirely too much time on sex and the jesters therein.  That's when the laughter stopped and he just wasn't funny anymore.  His entire set stayed on filthy explanations on sex.  This type of comedienne always says that ""all men think and do exactly like the comedienne thinks and acts"" in reference to the sex.- just dirty minded with sex on their brain every waking minute of the day.  If that is truly the mind set of men there could never be any honest relationship with a woman.  His words would always say what men know you want to hear, but just as a wolf in sheep;s clothing, their words would be deceitful and untrue. My own father taught his kids that ""All men are liars and if a man will lie to you he will steal from you and if a man will steal from you he will always try to deceive you"".  I found this teaching confusing coming  from my Dad because he was a man, but I found throughout life that he was right.",1505606400,,1029,4.187817258883249
