2016703,4,B0001MXPF4,I am a Speech-Language Pathologist working with children ages birth to three with speech/language delays.  I purchased this video as a therapy tool.  I have given the video to most of my parents for review.  I have found that it really reinforces the strategies that I am using during therapy.  Baby Babble is different from other children's videos of this sort because it provides speech/language models to the display of toys instead of just playing music in the background.  I have found that many of my clients have enjoyed the video and wanted to view it over and over!  The parents report that their children were able to imitate many of the language models provided.  I also enjoy that it provided signs to go along with the spoken words.  This was especially helpful for those children who are not yet talking.  I would recommend Baby Babble for infants/toddlers with or without speech-language delays.,1097712000,138,910,4.895424836601308
2016704,5,B0001MXPF4,"I have had the video for a few months and have shared it with at least a dozen 1-3 yr olds on my caseload.  I have watched their reactions to the video and have been impressed. These children love the video and are verbalizing along with it. I have shared it with age-appropriate children, language delayed children, children with Downs Syndrome, children on the autism spectrum, and more.

Benefits of the video:
+ It has engaging toys that move and keep the child's interest
+ the sounds are easy for the child to say and repeat
+ the children naturally want to interact with the video and repeat the sounds and signs
+ the speech therapists remain completely still during their camera parts so that young children will focus on their mouths (for speaking) or hands (for signing) and are not distracted by outside movements/facial expressions.
+ there are musical toy breaks (segments without speech or signs) so that the child is not overstimulated
+ the included developmental chart is beneficial for parents
+ the parent tutorial gives parents hands-on ideas that they can use on a regular basis.

Things I would change:
- more signs in the sign language tutorial
- a higher age range for slightly older children

This video is well done and I will continue to recommend it to families that I work with.",1097539200,39,1308,4.723684210526316
2016705,5,B0001MXPF4,"My 15 month old son loves this video. We have had this DVD for about 3 months now. I usually watch it with him and we work on the sounds, signs, and mouth movements together. It is nice for parent-child interaction because they have time in between the clips so I don't feel rushed. The best part though, is that he has increased his talking by 100% since we got the video. We watch it several times a week when he requests it by saying ""bab bab"" while he dances around like the bear in one of their clips. It is a great resource-- especially for parents of children that are in the beginning talking and babbling stage of development.",1097280000,4,635,4.3
2016706,5,B0001MXPF4,"My 26 month old son really enjoys this video.  Recently he was found to have a significant language delay.  My speech therapist recommended this video to encourage his communication skills and  reinforce the basic sign language signs we are trying to teach him.

We have had the video less than a week and he is already using several signs.  In particular the video taught him the ""help"" sign.  We had been working with him on ""help"", but he didn't seem to get it.  After several viewings of your video, he now says and signs help.

We have lots of other videos, but Baby Babble is by far his favorite.  And as I already mentioned, he is putting the skills taught in the video to use in his everyday interactions.",1097020800,3,713,4.465116279069767
2016707,1,B0001MXPF4,"There are several segments to this video. The parent section has 12 helpful points for helping your baby talk. The 3rd section is some basic signs, its short and ok.

The main section is where the baby is supposed to be helped talking. It is a very boring, sterile, low budget toy advertisement. Many of the segments don't make any sense at all. Mostly showing a closeup of some toy with Fisherprice logo prominently displayed for no particular reason. The speech pathologists are completely stone faced during the entire video. It is painful to watch.

Some of the segment focuses more on language than speech, ie trying to convey the concept of in and out. But rather than use a simple container and placing something in and taking it out, they have some bizarre complex toy where you drop a ball and it meanders around some obstacles to illustrate ""in"". Very confusing.

This is one time I really wished I could have seen an excerpt before I bought it.",1096934400,20,955,4.6390532544378695
2016708,5,B0001MXPF4,"I think that this video is different from other videos such as Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. because it focuses on speech and communication rather than language. What I mean by that is that our other videos seem to just throw out a bunch of words and hope that kids pick them up. Instead, this video takes fun sounds from toys, forms them into simple vowel and consonant sounds, and then shows how to make the sounds. So, for example, it takes a fire engine sound, transitions the sound into a narrator saying ah-ah-ah, e-oo-e-oo-e-oo, and then later shows the narrator's mouth making the vowel sounds. My son picked up the sounds before he started saying the words. I noticed that the words that the video uses are simpler than other videos use, words like ball, up, and down. They are the words that a child would commonly say first in speech development.  Also, my son picked up a couple of signs from the video. Even though he can't say ""eat"" yet, he now signs ""eat"" instead of feeling like he has to whine. The video is made by a couple of speech pathologists, and it has a tutorial at the end that demonstrates techniques that they use. I picked up a few things that helped. Now I try to teach my son sounds before words. I changed his environment to make him communicate; I put his favorite couple of toys in containers so that he has to come to me and ask me to open the containers for him. All in all, I think this video is really good. It is a lot different from my other videos. My son and I have learned from it.",1095206400,182,1527,4.320557491289199
2016709,5,B0001MXPF4,My 20 month old son is speech delayed and we have had this DVD for about a month now.  He really loves it.  He has learned some of the signs already and I think this can only help him.  I always watch it with him and we work on this together.  I do recommend this for other moms.  I think it would even be great for younger babies who don't even have speech delays.,1089072000,8,365,3.8783783783783785
2016710,5,B0001MXPF4,I purchased this DVD a week ago after being told that my son was showing signs of having a developemental delay.  My son will run to the TV when I put this DVD in and he will sit or dance while watching it.  He has added to his vocabulary almost 100% and is able to use the sign language that is shown in this DVD.  I am amazed and thrilled at the results.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone who is looking for help in regards to late talking little ones.,1087257600,24,459,3.9565217391304346
2016741,5,B0001MXPF4,"Baby Babble is an amazing resource if you have a toddler with delayed speech. My son is in an early intervention speech program through our state. I was searching for things to assist us with promoting his speech and these videos kept coming up, and now I know why.

The video shows real live humans and toys. For some reason, this was very captivating to my child. He pays close attention when we are watching it. The women in the video make noises and the camera zooms in and pans out on the mouths on the screen. This is something that speech therapists emphasize as being important for speech. The video also gives 10-12 different signs for needs that toddlers have.

I think this is a great video to assist parents with speech development. You cannot just set your child in front of the video and expect them to start talking, but they will imitate the sounds. As the parent, if you watch it as well it is very helpful to learn what to do to show your child how sounds are made and also how to communicate using sign language. My son has made huge leaps in his speech development and I think that watching this video is part of the reason why.",1510012800,,1148,4.359813084112149

2016749,5,B0001MXPF4,I felt my 2 year old was a little speech delayed so I purchased this and he really loves to watch it. I also have noticed that hes been more vocal. I will be pruchasing the other volumes one by one as they do get costly.,1505260800,,220,3.8043478260869565
2016750,5,B0001MXPF4,"MAKE MORE!!! [Seems cheesy when you are watching it as a parent, BUT your child WILL start forming sounds, words, noises -- and the toys every few seconds going across the screen with the noises and words to match will hold their attention -- I promise!]",1505260800,,254,4.543478260869565
2016761,4,B0001MXPF4,"Surprisingly my daughter responded well to this DVD. She has never tried to mimic words or sounds from other shows, cartoons or DVDs, even Leap Frog! This video is REALLY outdated. I mean, it looks super low budget, simple and old. But I think that's what kids need? It draws her attention and she tries to make all the sounds. The therapists in the video visually make sounds with their mouths, they play with toys and make sounds, and they also provide a segment at the end showing how to practice speech with your child.",1505088000,,523,4.515789473684211

2016763,4,B0001MXPF4,"I read the reviews and decided to purchase Baby Babble with the hopes encouraging my son to speak.  For whatever reason my son loves this video. No frills, simple, engaging movie that grabs the attention of him. I also purchased Baby Babble 2 so we could ""change"" it up!!! I'm not sure why some reference it to being ""scary"". I Totally recommend the video to anyone looking to help encourage their child's vocabulary.",1502236800,2,417,4.712328767123288

2016765,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son, his wife and most importantly my granddaughter loves to watch; she is a delayed talker and even her older brother likes to watch.  Her father plays it in the car.  Her speech therapist has actually purchased these DVDs as a training and learning tool for her other clients.",1499385600,,281,4.6
2016766,5,B0001MXPF4,"My 2 year old son has a speech delay, he only says about 25 words right now. I try to work with him all the time and he refuses to speak or repeat anything we say. I put this DVD in and he said 3 new words and was instantly trying to sign 2 of the words they did! We watch this every afternoon now. She makes a lot of movements with her mouth like these,  just trying to get them to copy and practice vocal sounds. And he does it! I am so excited to see him practicing! I would highly recommend this DVD!",1498262400,,504,3.8
2016767,3,B0001MXPF4,Great concept but REALLY dated. I wish they had a newer volume that was more current,1498089600,,84,4.3125
2016768,5,B0001MXPF4,My son loved it. At first he was just staring still on verbal. But a few days passed and he was mimicking and now talking,1497484800,,121,3.88

2016770,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son LOVES this video series. Not many shows or videos capture his attention but this one is a winner. He basically only said one or 2 words until about 22-23 months. Then all of a sudden out of the blue, he started repeating words and trying to imitate things my husband and I say or do. He has made a lot of progress and these videos seem to help. Now instead of just watching them, he repeats the words the therapist are saying or imitate what the people are doing in the videos. He points and tries to show me the stuff that he thinks is interesting in the video. It's awesome for kids who may be speech delayed or late talkers. Similar series like Baby Einstein were a fail, but not this one. Definitely recommend.",1497052800,,721,4.2700729927007295
2016781,5,B0001MXPF4,"This is a great DVD! I love anything that's ""Baby Crack,"" but I truly feel like my boys are learning from this. They sit quietly and watch this DVD, while repeating the sounds they're making. It's very interactive!

2016783,3,B0001MXPF4,As other reviewers stated the production is old my biggest critique is how short the DVD is.,1494806400,,92,4.470588235294118
2016784,5,B0001MXPF4,"My 27 month old is speech delayed (or so I thought). We have OT, Hippo Therapy and EI galore. Tantrums happen when a child cant speak. I am very reluctant about videos and media. However, as a mother, I will do everything I can to help my child excel. I saw some good ratings on this and tried it. He was immediately tuned in. He already talks but not enough. Watching the video, he mimicked every noise and every single word. He actually SAID all of the words that they were saying. That is proof that it is in there. I will be purchasing the rest of the videos. This DVD unleashed his voice. Happy tears.",1494115200,4,606,4.232758620689655
2016785,5,B0001MXPF4,"I would recommend this to any parent concerned about delayed speech in their child.  It is very boring to an adult, but mesmerizing for the children.  It has lots of repetition and gives them opportunities to imitate at their own pace.  Lots of bright colors.  I give these as gifts to friends who are expecting.",1494115200,,312,4.618181818181818
2016786,5,B0001MXPF4,My 2 year old has a speech delay and is behind 7 months. He loves this video and has been imitating everything. Wish it was a longer video though. Will be ordering the other 2 videos as well.,1492819200,,191,4.052631578947368

2016789,5,B0001MXPF4,This whole DVD series helped my son SO much. We knew something was wrong at his first birthday when we saw other one year olds saying words and our son wasn't uttering anything yet. He was just pointing. We started speech therapy and got all three of these dvd's and boy did they help. It got to the point where he came home from daycare everyday and asked to watch these videos. He imitated what he could and started saying more words and sounds. The format just captures their attention so easily and holds it for the entire video.  He's almost three and still asks to watch them once in awhile and we have almost conquered his speech delay.  I recommend them to everyone now and will use them from birth on for future kids.,1490745600,,726,4.37037037037037
2016790,5,B0001MXPF4,"My 19 month old loves this video we started speech therapy and I wanted to have a reference for myself this DVD is perfect I bought it along with sookie and Finn's day but this one is better out of the reviews I was concerned it was outdated and that's laughable you can barely tell maybe the toys are older but think 90s not 70s (babies don't care!). Overall he's been watching it two weeks and has mastered the babbles and a few signs. The best is the parent part with instructions, I've learned a lot of tips and found excellent toys because of this DVD.",1490745600,,557,4.264150943396227

2016803,3,B0001MXPF4,"I'm an SLP and was excited to use this and possibly suggest to my clients' parents to use with their language and speech delayed children. My clients that I anticipated would enjoy it found little interest and engagement. At times she seemed as she would doze of. The concepts are great, and the models of speech production, but the activities and play is uninteresting to watch.",1488326400,,379,4.757575757575758
2016804,5,B0001MXPF4,"I wanted to address some of the other reviewers comments and add my own thoughts in regards to this dvd. Yes it is an oldie, not ancient, nor ""outdated"" either, but a classic is what I prefer to call it. It's can seem a little cheesy and silly yet it's engaging for little ones. It was made by 2 speech therapists. It will not work for every child, but I guarentee for most with speech delays, it will help in some way or another. We have 6 children, one of our sons had speech apraxia and a phonological disorder. He knew what he wanted to say but his mouth and tongue couldn't form the words. This lead to tantrums, meltdowns and quite a bit of frustration on his part. Though he received speech therapy, we still needed to work with him daily to help re-enforce what the therapist was working on. We found this dvd and the Signing Times dvds invaluable. Learning to sign eased frustratuons, (and he'd sign and speak the words, not just sign them). (The Signing Times dvds was a joy and fun). This dvd shows little ones how to form the words, like ""Pop, pop, pop"" while seeing a therapist do it and illustrating balls popping. It was colorful, cute and funny. Our son was about 2 or so when we started using this dvd. To give you an idea of its age, Noah will be 15yr old the end of this month. But I'd buy it again for a grandchild in a hot minute!!! By the time Noah was 3 1/2 he was talking more fluently. We look back now and his speech problems are a distant memory and believe me when I say that he hasn't stopped talking since he started! Hahaha He is now in 8th grade honors classes, Beta Club and just received an invite for early college. His reading level is that of a college student. So don't fret about your little ones speech. Teaching sign language while working on speech so they have a way of communicating needs and wants. Find ways of playing with them with speech sounds, make it into a game. Be blessed",1487462400,,1926,4.2650273224043715

2016807,5,B0001MXPF4,"Purchased this DVD for my 18 month old nonverbal grandson who is receiving speech therapy. It was a little something to put in his stocking just to try. I was confused by the reviews which for the most part were love it or hate it. I knew upfront it was dated. Explained that to my daughter.

The first time they plugged it in she called and asked, ""what kind of voodoo crack is this?"" He never took his eyes off the screen. When it was over he was up running around and babbling like crazy. He doesn't watch videos so I wasn't expecting much! Yes it's dated, yes it would be difficult for me to watch over and over except for the fact that it works wonders for him! Over and over he is glued to the tv! I'm ordering the second DVD today!

2016810,4,B0001MXPF4,My son LOVES this and it has helped him. There are 4 in the series and we purchased 2 (original and beginning words) and they are basically the same so my advice is buy Baby Babble (the original) because the subsequent ones are going to be the same.

2016822,5,B0001MXPF4,"Couldn't be happier or more impressed with this video. The video has helped a lot with my speech delayed son. He LOVES this video. This is one of the only videos he will watch all the way through without getting distracted. And that has been MULTIPLE times.
He now has starting to say a few words and is really using the sign language he has learned on the video. This video has greatly decreased his frustration with not being able to communicate. Would highly recommend this video to anyone needing extra help with their child's speech.
And just a word of advice, don't judge the video by what you as an adult think of it let your child decide. I would have NEVER thought this video would have kept my very hyper toddler engaged let alone seeing him learn sign language and verbal words.

2016830,5,B0001MXPF4,This DVD works great. I used this DVD for my now 7 year old when he was a baby.  I thought it was odd when watching it but he learned a lot and loved watching it over and over again. I bought it again for my now almost 2 year old who is a preemie. Once he started watching this DVD he began using sign language and his verbal repeating picked up quickly.  He also loves to watch the DVD over and over and over again which can be a bit much on me.

2016843,5,B0001MXPF4,"This is one of my favorite child/baby shows. All four of my children loved watching this when they were babies. About 8 years ago, I came across Baby Babble at the library, and checked it out. My daughter was so enthralled, I actually purchased it. No. It's not high tech. Yes, the speech therapists clothes/hair styles are dated. But who cares?  The video is not brand new!  It was made 12 years ago. What I loved about it was the fact that it enhanced my children's speech. They still love the movie whenever I play it for my 20-month-old. Even if it doesn't enhance your baby's speech, it can entertain them for 20-30 minutes while you cook some dinner!",1477353600,,656,4.504201680672269
2016844,1,B0001MXPF4,Terrible. I would never buy again. I wish we hadn't missed the return window. It's so bizarre. Barely focuses on language. Looks like it was filmed in someone's living room. Supreme waste of money.,1475884800,,197,4.823529411764706

2016846,5,B0001MXPF4,"My child is 25 months old. He recently said his first word a month after using Nordic Naturals DHA and started vocalizing more. However, besides the speech therapy he's been getting since May, I feel like he needed more help at home.  Despite some of the ratings that's it is of poor quality I bought it anyway. He was tuned in from the minute I popped it in the DVD. We got it on a Friday and have been playing it once a day.  4 days later he is starting to mouth the words that they're saying. I catch him by himself making the sounds. It's the most progress I've seen in him. He is using ""more"" sign language a bit more and is actually repeating sounds and words. I've been trying to get him to repeat after me since he was 9 months with no success. It's really a great DVD. I plan on buying part2. Im always quick to question these ratings that have miracle results, it may not work for everyone but my son is finally making some great progress and im so happy.",1474848000,9,965,4.1550802139037435

2016848,3,B0001MXPF4,"Alas, my 21 month old toddler has speech delays.  He babbles a ton but has not really figured out words.  As a Mom desperate for a miracle cure (but smart enough to know better), I ordered this video on the off chance that this would jump start him for his upcoming speech therapy sessions.  Also, I figured if my kid was going to watch TV, this was probably as good as any other kids' program, so why not give it a shot?  Plus, the positive reviews on here gave me hope.

We've watched it 3 times so far over the course of a week.  The first time, my son was really exhausted when we turned it on, but he stayed riveted to the TV and laughed a few times in response to the video.  The second time he babbled once and still stayed focused.  The third time, he drifted away a bit to chase our cat. Apparently 1980s television production will only hold his gaze so long!  Kids today.

As for the video itself, the adults watching along with their kids will chuckle.  My husband and I had some snarky commentary, all in good fun of course.  It is older video production.  It's as if someone set up a home video camera on a bunch of 1980s toddler toys, and the speech therapist folks move them around and make noise (I am oversimplifying this, but that is the gist of the video content).  The therapists also appear on the video to make bizarre facial expressions (thus eliciting the snarky commentary from me and my husband) and to show basic sign language.

So far, we have not seen any miracles.  But to be fair, they never promised miracles and my kid actually seems to enjoy the program.  Either way, we are not cancelling our speech therapy sessions.  Should you buy it?  Meh. Couldn't hurt.",1474416000,,1693,4.3514376996805115

He is trying to copy the sounds which is his weak point but he is trying and that's awesome. This video is dated, but that's to be expected with a video that was released in 2004. Even though it is dated, it still has all of the learning techniques that our speech therapist does. It's like being apart of a session. The floating heads is weird but I understand stand why they do it. It's so the child can focus on their mouth and the sounds they are making. It's a fun and captivating dvd for the little ones.

My son has watched it four times in the last three days, the last two times were his choice. He tries his best to mimick the sounds already and this DVD absolutely excites him.

2016870,5,B0001MXPF4,"All the baby babble dvds are great. My daughter is 2 and was told she has a speech delay. She also sees a therapist. We were given the dvds by my mother who read good reviews. I am not sure what it is about the show but my daughter not only loves it but she also repeats it and has learned so much. There is not much to it, just toys in front of a black screen which the therapists say the name of toy or action of toy.  As a parent who watches it with her I find I learn a lot too. With the lessons at the end of the show, the bit of sign language taught, and also we own a lot of the toys used in the show so I get an idea of how I should be talking while playing. Also, the type of tones, ways of speaking and usage of toys are very similar to what our therapist does with our daughter. Watching the DVD alone will not do much to help your child, but taking what you learn from it and using it in everyday play is so helpful!

The dvds (all stages) have just help us as a family so much! Also, we try to limit her tv time. So this is something she seems to like watching and I know is helping her. I really think for both parents & the child these are great.",1466726400,,1161,3.7540983606557377

2016886,5,B0001MXPF4,"My best friend recommended this to me when my oldest was a baby, and I'm so glad she did. My son was picking up on words that were emphasized in this series pretty early on. He used some of the more common words they go over like ""push ball"" and ""fall down"" soon after he started talking. The tutorial at the end was awesome! My husband and I now use the tips for our second child who is 7 months old.
My son still loves watching these. When we first started using these dvds he would come running if we asked him if he wanted to watch Babble. And the second he heard the first notes of music on the DVD he would get super excited and start cheesing. My husband and I will watch it with the kids and say the words to them along with the tv since studies have shown that tv and human interaction light up different parts of the brain. I would recommend doing that instead of just plopping them in front of the tv. We actually have a few scenes we love. One we affectionately refer to as Dancing Bear, and when he is on the screen we all stand up and wave our arms and shake our legs. My son laughs and thinks it's the funniest thing ever.

2016889,5,B0001MXPF4,"At age two my son was diagnosed with a severe speech delay (apraxia) and our speech therapist recommended this video. Keep in mind that this video is designed specifically for young children with speech delays and it recreates the activities of a typical speech therapy session. It doesn't have slick graphics or music and the pace is very slow--on purpose. The idea is to model speech and encourage children to mimic the sounds. It works very well. My son loved the videos (there are three total in the series) and they helped him learn basic phonemes. The videos also helped us to learn how to model speech for our son and how to encourage him to speak. If you are looking for a video for a normally developing child you probably won't like this but for those of us whose kids have an actual diagnosed speech delay, it's an incredibly useful tool.",1461542400,3,849,4.592105263157895

He has no clue how outdated it is, nor does he care, and these speech pathologists that made this DVD know a lot more than I do apparently, because this DVD holds his attention unlike anything else! I think it's luck of the draw whether this DVD can keep your little one engaged and I just happened to luck out on this one I guess after reading some negative reviews. Prior to this DVD he would only say the word, ""hi"" once in a blue moon and now, after about a month of watching this, he's much more vocal and attempts to ""conversate"" more than ever. Granted he isn't saying actual words yet, but I feel excited that he's making much more complex sounds. This DVD also helped me in giving me ideas and a guide to help my son in ways I didn't even think of. People always tell me that I shouldn't be in a rush to have him talk because once he does, he won't be quiet, however I can't stand to see his frustration and I could use a few less tantrums!

To get the most out of this DVD you need to watch it WITH your child...I thought it was going to be a waste of money, BUT, I think I was wrong. We decided to use it anyway despite the oddness and my son is babbling a significant deal more just in a week! I'm not sure why it's working but it does indeed seem to be. I'd recommend it, can't hurt that's for sure! The quality isn't amazing, you can tell it was originally for VHS but it's worth the price I think.",1449187200,,724,3.958904109589041

She is 11 months now and she says a few words such as (up, down, mama, daddy, bye bye,  tee tee, momo, baby, papa and No). But this video has truly encouraged her speech and language development both verbally and with sign language.  Even though the video seems dated the powerful effect it had on my child was priceless. Also, its good to watch the video with your child and use the tips they show you in the video daily. Don't leave your child in front of the TV and expect the therapist  to teach them.

Sometimes she is so enthralled/distracted by the toys at our regular speech therapy that she doesn't make the same effort that she does when watching these videos.

He's obviously very intelligent, but speech delayed. A speech therapist recommended Baby Babble so we decided to give it a try.  A try?  My gosh, it turned out to be MUCH more than a try!  He was mesmerized by the words, pictures, and simple sounds of this DVD.  In short, he LOVED it and sat still for its entirety.  Now, one short month later, his vocabulary is exploding.  He is making all the sounds he heard on the DVD, and he is saying the words of the objects before they even appear on the screen.  It is phenomenal !  There is no way I would say it is a mere ""coincidence"" that he is now verbal.  Baby Babble played a large part in this progress.  I recommend this DVD to ANYONE who even questions the development of their child's speech. It is great!  Yes, it is simple and seemingly ""old fashioned"" at first glance.  Just trust it.

2017058,5,B0001MXPF4,"The first time you watch this video, you're going to think you made a mistake. It seems very strange and dated. I, like you, was sold by all the reviews. Once I made the purchase though, this video sat unwatched in my prime app. After it became apparent our 19 month old had a slight speech delay we were desperate to keep stimulating him and willing to try anything.

The second, third and thousandth time I watched this series I can honestly say it's perfect. It's simple with happy music, quick colorful scenes and sounds and dramatic changes from image to image. It's exactly what you need to keep a little one entertained.

Expect to see images of popular children's toys paired with bouncy music, while narrators make sounds. Some scenes are just colors and music, while cut away images of the narrators show basic sign language. This is not a signing video though - it's a communication video.

We watch each video in the series once in the morning and once in the evening while he plays or eats. I can honestly say after 8 weeks of doing this faithfully he has more than tripled his vocabulary. Granted we were starting at a pretting low point of two or three words, but as of today (just shy of 21 months), he easily has command of 40 or more unique words and sounds. Keep in mind that we are also incorporating daily use of picture and word books, but I attribute the lion's share to this video series.

He wasn't glued to it the first five or ten times he watched, and even now sometimes it just plays in the background while he builds with his mega blocks; but he's definitely hearing it and learning. Just now as I typed this he said ""P!"" Right as the narrator introduced the letter. It's a fun video series that empowers babies and toddlers to learn from imagery in short, bright bursts. Exactly appropriate for their growing brains.

For mom and dad the movies can become a bit tedious and nerve wracking, but hopefully when you see dramatic improvement in your child's vocabulary you won't mind as much. I don't. I am extremely happy with this purchase. Keep an open mind and you will be too!",1430611200,,2108,4.493472584856397

If you are a parent of a child that needs help speaking, PLEASE try these. I don't know about babies, but for a 3 year old it is definitely worth it.

 I purchased the dvd's because i felt she was delayed in her speech and it got her attention when i played it on youtube. Within a month we noticed a difference.
Every morning I play all 3 dvds for her. If i dont, she pushes me to the tv screaming ""babuuu please come on"" and then claps while telling me ""good girl"" when i play it. She interacts with the dvd and randomly during the day will start doing the letter workouts.
The quality of dvd's is like power point slides put into a vhs.
The dvd also gives parents sign language lessons and tips on how to help your child to annunciate letters better.

Now I have a 1 year old son who is only saying a few words but lots of sounds! He wants to talk so bad we just don't know what he's saying so I am excited to purchase this again and I hope that it does as well for him as it did for my daughter! I highly recommend these DVD's for any child 6 months of age and up with or without speech delays. I read another reviewers comment on the graphics and how the video seems dated and she's absolutely right! But, regardless of that it still works! So in my opinion I don't really care what it looks like I only care if it is helpful or not! Consider this for your child. You won't regret it.",1421971200,2,1076,4.080188679245283
2017088,5,B0001MXPF4,"Yes, I am not impressed at all. Boring and outdated....BUT my 15 mo loves it and gets upset when it's over. Today was only the second day she watched it, so not sure how it will help yet.

Update...my 3 1/2 yo daughter is far above her counterparts in her speech and vocabulary. I can't say it was these dvds because we also did baby signing time with her, but I'd like to think the combo worked. My friend, who's 3 yo is barely understandable, just borrowed my set. I'm hoping it'll help her too. My suggestion- it can't hurt, and may help so why not?",1421798400,,552,4.2075471698113205
2017089,4,B0001MXPF4,It helped. That's all I cared about.,1421798400,,36,4.285714285714286
2017090,5,B0001MXPF4,"We got this as a precautionary measure for our 18 month old triplets, since triplets are usually speech delayed.  After maybe 10 or so views, our babies were mimicing the sounds that the video speakers repeated. It was very cute: If the video voice said ""Pop! Pop! Pop!, pretty soon I had 3 little babies in a row, laughing and going ""Pop! Pop! Pop!"" Or maybe it was Bop Bop Bop. Anyway, they had fun while they were learning, which I count as a victory.  I think it really helped that I usually watched the video with them, and made the noises or words myself right along with the video (After a few views you'll have it memorized too, I promise!).  Monkey see, Monkey do!  So they weren't just copying the video, they were copying Mommy too.  I also tried to incorporate their concepts into the babies' daily play, such as, ""Ball in, Ball out, Ball down""
I agree with other reviewers that the video feels old and low budget.  However, remember the purpose of the video: to teach your child to understand  communication concepts, make their own babble, and hopefully to talk. I disagree that I'd want them distracted with flashy lights and loud sounds. I want them to focus on the lips of the speaker and think about the word they are communicating, and I think that would get lost with too much bright flashy action.  I think this video is brilliant in that it captures their attention just enough and does what its intended to do: Get your child talking!",1421625600,,1457,4.513307984790875
2017091,5,B0001MXPF4,"This series is amazing! At 18 months, my son's pediatrician referred us to have him evaluated for possible speech delays, as he had yet to say more than two words. He was diagnosed with a speech delay, and has been in weekly therapy for a year. Now, at 31 months, he has been diagnosed with Childhood Apraxia of Speech, which is a oral/motor planning problem. As he was beginning speech therapy a year ago, I stumbled across the Baby Babble series, and I cannot tell you how much they helped to improve his speech and language development! In addition to the therapy techniques, he would watch these videos almost daily - and in fact, he still asks to watch them repeatedly, even though he has them totally memorized! He absolutely LOVES watching these, and has since the first time we tried. The two SLPs who developed this video series are very clear in their explanations, and include a lot of useful tools for parents/caregivers in helping your child learn to speak. I credit this series with playing a MAJOR role in helping my son work through his challenges with speech. And bonus for parents, they are highly tolerable for adults, unlike so many other baby/toddler videos! They even include a section on basic sign language, which we found incredibly helpful in communicating with our son before he was able to use words. I highly recommend this series. Each of the three DVDs focus on the most prominent letters for that stage of development, and give exercises/games and words for the child to repeat which reinforce the use of those letters. It is truly amazing how much these helped him, and us, through a difficult stage of development. And just because my son has difficulty with speech and language, does not mean that a child without those challenges would not find this fun or helpful. I truly think these would be beneficial to all children who are learning to talk.",1421452800,,1883,4.72644376899696

At first he was completely mesmerized and wouldn't take his eyes of the screen for the length of the video.  He would sit in his chair and grunt at the TV until we would turn it on (several times/day).  Now watching it once a week will usually suffice.  Unfortunately, I can't say that it has improved his speech any up to this point, but if you need a brief distraction to take a deep breath or run to the restroom, this video will do the trick!",1419897600,,575,4.2

He just is completely enthralled with this video from beginning to end (only like 20 mins long). It's great when I'm cooking and I just want him to watch something educational for a bit to stay out of the kitchen. I try not to let him watch a lot of tv or cartoons so I figured this was a nice show since it teaches him at the same time. Well since he's watched this (2 months probably 10-15 times). He has learned to sign all 10 words and he started to say his first words!

2017096,5,B0001MXPF4,"When I turned on this DVD, I was disappointed at how dated the filming was. The toys used, music played, etc were very much outdated and you get this sense of low budget filming. However, this is coming from an adult's perspective. When my almost 2-yo toddler saw this dvd, he was hooked. He was glued to the tv!! And this is coming from a toddler who has a very short attention span. He was fascinated and was actually speaking or trying to speak the words spoken in the dvd. Great educational dvd in my book. Dvd shows simple visually stimulating toys and accompaying words for toddlers to learn... ~30mins in duration. I suspect, b/c dvd keeps things simple, a toddler can make sense of what is shown and be interested in the contents presented.  Dvd also has extra features such as tips for parents.

There are quick snips of the therapists doing signs like ""please"" and ""eat"" but no reinforcement on what the signs means. The entire video consists of snips of different things happening, objects moving and so forth. There were even parts that I thought were creepy and weird like when the camera would zoom in on a piggy bank face (which was a old wrinkly not regular pig face) and snips of trippy shapes moving with strange music. The video could be good for a infant, but not so much a toddler. My son and I were not a fan",1416441600,11,591,4.333333333333333

Besides the fact that I'm already seeing much more desire and effort from him to sign/talk, it also holds his attention and helps me whenever he gets fussy. Also, when it's diaper changing time and he gets fussy, I say phrases or sounds from this program and he seems to pay attention and calm down.

I was becoming concerned because she was not using her mama and papa sounds that she had been using months earlier.  After working with her and the DVD for one week (once a day, every day) she began picking up more sounds and you could see her making connections with the program content and her own environment i.e. finding similar toys in our home, playing with them etc.  Yes, it is a little dated but I found it to be a good starting point and extremely helpful.

Desperate for help, I decided to search for videos to train him at home instead.  My husband and I are amazed at his progress.  My son is addicted to this video and watches it ovet and over.  After two weeks, he is speaking 10 words and is mimicking us to learn more.  I am so grateful to these therapists who put the video together.  They are brilliant!!!!  I bought the other two as a result.",1405123200,,542,4.194174757281553

2017156,5,B0001MXPF4,"My 2.5 year old has had developmental and speech delays since he was 8 months old and still not sitting up on his own.  Currently he still doesn't say any actual words, but this has helped a lot.  He's been in therapy for two years now but it has taken them awhile to find the 'key' to getting him to be calm and want to work during sessions.  He's hesitant towards people coming in and making him do things so he wasn't making much progress.

He's finally caught up (mostly) developmentally with others his age but still not talking so I found this DVD and it has been great!  He went from babbling just a few times a day, minimal facial expressions and not wanting to imitate to being a babbling king!  Two different speech therapists and even his father and I couldn't get through to him like this DVD did.  He mimics and imitates their noises, some signs, and their facial expressions and his has taken what's he has seen and learned and gladly shows his therapists the things he is learning.  He usually sits and focuses well on the first 15 minutes then watches on and off for the rest, but that's fine with me!  He's only 2 so I can't expect him to want to sit still and watch a movie for 25 minutes.

For the people complaining about the quality of the video, this was released over 10 years ago now.  Look back 10 years in your photo albums and it'll be just as ""dated""!  Things have much improved since then so of course the quality is not going to be what you would expect from a DVD released yesterday.  It would be awesome if they could re-shoot and make a more updated version but honestly it doesn't bother me or my son at all.",1403740800,,1642,4.275080906148867

Mostly a fast babbling begins and conversations can begin holding a book sitting on the floor. I listen very carefully. I take the cue to repeat the sounds the toddler is making. With eyebrows lifted and a smile on their face, I babble right along with them. I watch two or three toddlers together babbling without interruptions. I document what I see and enter this into their personal binders. I play this dvd during play in the morning and once again in the afternoon.

He loves the faces and the sounds on the screen. It's very appropriate for babies. They show baby music,  baby images, toys, & sign language lessons. My son giggles and babbles back to the screen.

Cons: yes, it's a bit outdated and low quality. it can be easily refilmed. But it doesn't matter to my son.

When I watched it for the first time with her, she only glanced at it and I thought I was wasting my time, but after playing it 3 times, she is glued to the tv watching every motion.  She is making the faces with the two ladies and shakes her head yes and no.

The first part is a series of shots of different toys, with speech therapists describing them, making sound affects as if they were providing their services in your home... I couldn't believe, from the first time we watched it, it held my son's attention the entire time. It ends with a parent tutorial and sign language tutorial... very useful for myself and he even watches this part to the very end!

I read before that others said it had creepy faces and its a bad recording. I did not think this was true. It might be older but I think it's supposed to show real life objects in a real context.  I have no complaints. And the faces were not scary- they were just isolated so kids could focus in on facial expressions.

The therapists that created this video were not overly exuberant and downright boring in some spots.  While I know that over animation can sometimes be detrimental to therapy, there is a point where you find a happy medium to keep the infant engaged with what you are doing.  My niece fell asleep during the first play of the DVD, and I told my sister I won't be buying the next level, it was not worth the money.  She did want to go ahead and keep it for the sign language presented at the end of the DVD, there were, however, only ten symbols presented at the end, and that does not address a day of activity in the life of a one year old.

The words, tools and toys used were dated and did not keep my grandsons attention. As someone who has taught children, I expected much more. Children want to hear the actual words, wonderful sounds, they want to hear excitement, they want and need to hear the colors that are visible. My daughter was as stunned as I was. The whole, ""Speech Pathologists"" was the bait for selling this video, sadly I bought into it. Would not give this expensive video away. Very Disappointed.",1394582400,8,746,4.790697674418604

I've been taking her to two different speech therapists a week and thought I would give the baby babble dvd series a try.  I love how it reinforces what we learn from therapy, many of the parent tips are exactly what we were told in our therapy session.  The sign language is an added bonus.  My daughter loves them, is entertained by them when she learns, but also likes to show off when she knows something they show on the video too.

WHY he is so willing to watch it is mystifying since I agree with the reviews that this video was produced in someone's basement using toys from Good Will.  He also learned the sign for more which is great progress for us.  I am going to show it a few more times but it's possible that the problem is going to require real speech therapy as it could be an apraxia. (He's says a couple words and never on demand).

While dated, this immediately caught my toddler's attention and KEPT IT for the full 28 minutes. She gets so excited to see the toys and hear the sounds and words being used. This is a VERY basic baby babbling DVD. Words like ""up"", ""down"", and sounds like ""mmmm!"" in repetition along with sign language are used. My daughter who has never mimicked  or repeated words is suddenly repeating sounds and words along with the DVD. I am amazed and shocked how well this is working. It's helped my daughter say ""duck"", ""eat"" and say ""MMMM!"" when she sees the rabbit eat the carrots.

When we first watched it, I will admit that I said ""Oh what a waste of $18"". The woman in black is quite scary and as previous reviewer have said, it looks like she has a floating head. She doesn't smile and makes lots of noises. It does remind me a lot of Baby Einstein but with a slightly lower budget.

We have had it for a little over two weeks and my toddler has already started to mimic the noises on the DVD, as well as dancing with a dancing bear and grabbing at the balloons/bubbles when they appear on the screen. He recently learned how to sign ""more please"" and will even sign ""more"" when the DVD is over. I would say that it took him about a week of watching it (about 1-2 times a day) for him to start mimicking what he saw. I will add that this is not a ""babysitting"" type of DVD.

My son is 29 months and only says about 20 singular words. On top of that, he is SUUUUPER high -strung && active. So, it makes it difficult to get him to sit down long enough to focus on learning new concepts and words. HOWEVER,  today was the 1st day of him watching this d.v.d. and he was GLUED TO IT! after the 3rd time around,  I was so amazed I actually took a picture and sent it to his father . The techniques are great and easy for him to understand. Will be buying the other two!! Thank you so much for this product! !",1388016000,,597,3.966666666666667

However, he and his momma dropped by while it was still going and he watched it.  Now every time he comes over 2-3 x a week - he says ""Ball TV"" (The first scene is a spinning ball), and he watches and repeats everything.  He even watches the credits and repeats.  I wish I would have had it before - we might have avoided going to therapy. :)",1385424000,,499,3.95

2017226,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son loves this video; He wants to watch it over and over again. Before I purchase this video I looked over the reviews both bad and good but, what really helped me decide to purchase was a women on youtube giving her review.

2017228,5,B0001MXPF4,We bought all three baby babble videos almost a year ago and my daughter who is 28 months now still asks to watch them. They are very dated but she learned a lot of words when she first started talking and it was amazing to watch her language develop each time she watched them. I would definitely recommend. She did not have any speech delays but she walked at 22 months and needed physical therapy and I ran out to get them because I wanted to assure that we would give her any possible tools to try to prevent any other delays. At the time we purchased them she wasn't speaking much and my husband and I feel that these videos were worth the time and money.,1383523200,,660,4.2047244094488185

My son has been slow to speak, which is why I got the DVDs in the first place, and now he is making the sounds and copying the words along with the ladies on the screen. He's also fascinated by the toys shown and says their names too. I've noticed huge improvements. He still has a way to go, and the DVDs aren't the final answer, but they've certainly gotten him babbling to himself more, using words in different situations and even saying words like ""bread"" when before the best he could manage was ""'uck"" for ""truck"". They are a fantastic boost to his language learning, and I highly recommend them.",1382227200,,722,4.3161764705882355

2017232,5,B0001MXPF4,This is the only DVD I let my daughter watch - she stays engaged is interested and seems to learn from the video. An added bonus is that my family - especially the less baby-savvy grandparent - has also learned how to speak to an infant. I will say we are anti-TV for kids under 2 (it is not recommended by the American pediatrics) so we just make sure we watch it together and interact with her for most of the time.,1381449600,,417,4.097560975609756

But, thanks to these DVD's they are babbling away..mama, papa, hi, bye, and baby talk all day long! I saw the difference in my eldest, in 3 weeks, who just made sounds with his mouth shut.

I bought this for my first baby 2 years ago and he loves it now my 7 month watches it and loves it too. I really believe this helped my son with his developments. The sign language really helped during those fustrating times of communication when he couldn't talk. Would def recommend.,1379808000,,442,4.402439024390244

So far, I only purchased the first one.  I have to tell you he loves it and has produced so many new sounds from what he's seeing and hearing from the dvd.  The Sign Language section is simple for parents and it really helps a parent whose child is frustrated b/c they cannot verbally express themself yet.  I am so happy I purchased this too.  The music is very soothing too and the toys depicted in the DVD help teach simple commands such as, open, close, in, out, up, down, pop, hello, etc.",1377388800,3,671,4.277777777777778

2017251,5,B0001MXPF4,"We just received this DVD a few days ago. Our son is 17 months & has a few words but we wanted to give him a boost with his language development. This is a great tool. He LOVES it, and is so captivated he will sit down and actually watch the program. He is engaging with it & trying to make the sounds along with the DVD. It has only been a few days but he is already being more vocal. And as a bonus he is using signs in context- which is new. We just finished a 6 week signing class, but he hadn't really show interest in signing, until after seeing the DVD. It could be coincidence? But I think it's related.
As for complaints about the production value- it is made for babies & toddlers, and they don't give a hoot about production value- they care about content. And the content is excellent. It is simple, clear & engaging. These are real exercises used by speech pathologists done in ways to appeal to children.
I would absolutely recommend this DVD, we are planning to get the rest of the series.",1376611200,2,1004,4.2072538860103625
2017252,5,B0001MXPF4,"My two year old son is hesitant to talk. We've always given him anything he wants without him asking for it so he just points, gets it, and doesn't have to say a word. He even gets mad at us when we try to make him say something. We suck at just letting him cry until he asks for this or that so we are no help, I suppose. He watches this video every day and actually likes it. He mimics the girls on the video and is already saying things that he wouldn't say before. He's not ready to mimic us yet, but he's getting there. He makes most of the sounds that are on the video and I'd say that it's really helping him a lot. One of the best things about it is that it has immediate benefits, at least where my son is concerned. He learned a lot of the sign language immediately and so even though he may not be able to say ""more food please,"" he signs it to us. It's amazing to watch his progress. It has only been about a month since we started baby babble. I also ordered the second video in the series at the same time but it is for more advanced talkers than my baby.

He enjoys watching the dvds, they keep his attention, but best of all he is trying to say the words and make the sounds and signs being taught on them! Since he has been watching them, he has started saying lots more words and is trying harder to communicate. I would highly recommend these dvds to anyone, whether your child is having communication problems or not, my two younger grandsons enjoy them also.",1375833600,3,537,4.546391752577319
2017255,1,B0001MXPF4,This video is very short and seems like it is more for an adult to watch to learn how to teach instead of a baby . It hardly teaches anything . The signing part of video is only a couple of eirds and then it goes to a part of showing toys with there name brand written underneath . I don't see how that is supossed to teach a baby . It is very boring and not enough info . I am hoping the second and third one are better because this is overpriced for the quality of dvd,1375660800,6,470,3.757575757575758

After watching this a few times I quickly ordered the next two. My son stays home with me so does not have not have other children to learn from. It seemed that since he started to watch these that he started to try talking more....I also use other dvds as well....sign language dvds, Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby....they all have there purpose but these really seemed to speed things up for him.
Also, my niece who is 5 really enjoyed watching these and she seemed to learn from them as well. She was still having some trouble with certain letters.

I do wish they used lighter colored back drops with more of the scenes, as I think that would have made the videos seem more cheery. Some of the reviews stated that the ladies were scary,....I wouldn't go as far as to say that however, in the 2nd and 3rd videos they do smile more so I can see where they would say that with the first one.....smiling is good :-)",1374537600,,1078,4.248780487804878

After hours of reading different blots and sites...I came across this video on Amazon. I thought...its worth a shot, the reviews were pretty good. I am so GLAD I bought this video. AFTER JUST ONCE OF WATCHING IT MY SON WAS STARTING TO IMITATE the sounds and words the ladies were saying!! I couldn't believe it...his vocabulary went from almost nothing to 10-15 words in just a couple days. My youngest son (18 months) loves to watch this video also. They ask to watch it a few times a day. I just ordered Baby Babble 2....hoping they like that one too! I would definitely recommend this video to everyone.",1373932800,2,913,4.345029239766082
2017268,5,B0001MXPF4,"My child has been watching the entire Baby Babble series since he was about a year old. He is 17 months old now and many of his first words (SPEAKING words, not just sign language) have come from watching these videos. Words like baby, daddy, mommy, up, down, out, more, truck, please, thank you, all done, eat, and countless others. The videos are designed to hold the short attention span of young children, and they definitely do. The intervals of music, incorporation of sounds, talking, simple objects, etc. ---all of those are specifically directed toward babies and toddlers. In my opinion, this series is better than Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. for the older baby/young toddler. It might be ""too educational"" for the really young baby. But, from 9 months to age 2 1/2 or maybe even older, I would say this series is THE BEST out there for speech, learning, and ""quiet time."". The series even focuses on certain letters like p,b, and m or t, d, n which directly coincides with the appropriate level of speech that a child is capable of learning as he/she grows. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE BABY BABLE SERIES (There are 3 in the series.)My child has learned a TON from it. He is usually very picky with what he has the attention span to watch, but these videos totally captivate him and not just every now and then, pretty much whenever we turn it on. Oh and as an added benefit, the videos are quite calming for the parents and the creators' approach toward teaching the concepts is actually quite fascinating.  A nice break from some of the ""annoying"" shows and DVDs that are out there for kids. And an overall great way to expose your child to language/learning. One of the best products we invested in during my son's first year and a half of life for sure.",1373932800,2,1774,4.596214511041009

Our 14 month old was good at nodding and shaking her head and pointing, but was not really catching on to communicating with her words.  I put this DVD in on our car ride to the sitter one morning and watched in the rear view mirror and she took it all in.  She watched it again on our way home.  When I went to get her out of her carseat she looks at me and says ""UP"".  I couldn't believe it!  For about a week she watched it once a day (usually on the way home because the dvd lasts about 20-25 min which is how long our commute is) and I noticed her sounds and language improving every day.  We took a break from it for about a week and she watched Dora.  The first time Dora played she is in the back saying ""D, D, D, Dora"".  It's amazing!  So we alternate between other videos and this, but she is always very excited for this (despite the fact that it is WAY outdated) and it holds her attention.  I am looking forward to getting Baby Babble 2 once she ""masters"" this one!  For our future babies I am going to start playing this even sooner now that I see how magical it is.

2017278,5,B0001MXPF4,My 2 year old really enjoys watching ALL the Baby Babble videos. It has helped expand her vocabulary and sound making. I'd recommend this video (and the other 2 in the series) to any parent with small children.,1370649600,2,210,4.552631578947368
2017279,2,B0001MXPF4,"My twins are 20 months old and in speech therapy. I thought this would help to enhance their learning based on the reviews.  It doesn't really.  It is more like a cheaply produced version of Baby Einstein without as much repetition of concepts, and not as much opportunity for parent-directed interaction.  When my kids watch Baby Einstein they sometimes laugh, get excited, or point.  When they watch this they usually just stare blankly.  There are no babies in this video which makes it hard for them to identify with.

Part 1 is made up of short segments either showing a toy with music in the background (i.e. a spinning toy), a woman making a sound or mouth movement, or a toy with an associated sound in the background (see a popping toy, hear somebody say ""pop pop ... pop pop pop... pop pop""... or a jack in the box and then somebody says ""Boo.""). The twins are mildly entertained by portions of it (the toys) but do not interact with the video in any way, nor do they try to replicate the sounds being demonstrated as they do during their speech therapy sessions.  My daughter is mildly afraid of the blonde woman wearing black, probably because she is very stoic.  Every time that woman shows up on the screen, my daughter covers her head with a blanket and turns away.

Part 2 = instructions to the parent (which I did not watch because my kids were not into it so I can't comment on this).

Part 3 briefly showed two women demonstrating signs.  The word is spoken, the written word is displayed, and you see the sign being made.  This will not be able to teach a child how to perform signs. It is more to show the parent what the sign is so that the parent can start teaching it to their child.  Since my kids already knew the signs and comprehend the spoken word, they understood this portion of the video... but it was not interactive.  ""Signing time - My first signs"" is way better.

Part 4 - toy bin - shows all the toys that were used in the making of this film with the brand of the toy so that you can go purchase it.  Kind of useless because none of those toys are in production anymore.

Maybe this video was good back in the day but I can't see it being useful at all when there are better videos out there.  It's also very expensive for what you get.",1370131200,,2274,4.32311320754717

2017281,1,B0001MXPF4,If your baby watches shows like this there is no hope for our future.  This show is being taught by a lady with Turners and a mix between kleinfelters and Edwards syndrome.  My sister showed this video to me when I visited my nephew for the first time and I was amazed that she spoke so highly about the reviews online.  This video however is overrated and in my opinion as a physician can only offer a delay in education.  What you should be doing is reading and working with your children instead of relying on a magic bullet that doesn't exist.,1369612800,8,547,4.333333333333333
2017282,4,B0001MXPF4,"As a first time mom, I thought my bilingual child had some sort of speech delay so I decided to buy this dvd to help her, but turns out she doesnt have any speech delay, she was just taking a little longer because she was assimilating two different languages. All in all, this dvd is great for kids that really do not express themselves with sounds and need some encouragement, the methodology is really good and I can see how it would help a child with speech delay to get moving :)",1369440000,,483,4.260869565217392
2017283,5,B0001MXPF4,"I swear by this DVD in multiple ways. I don't let my son watch television so this is it when it comes to screen time which happens either when I'm with him interacting or sick or exhausted and need a breather. Either way, he LOVES this DVD and can actually almost say DVD now. He will go to the laptop and point and motion until I put it on sometimes. In the beginning which was maybe around 9 mos, I would plop him on the couch with me and he'd just watch and sometimes crawl closer to the television. I really think he learned about 'up' and 'down' and 'in' and 'out' from this video. Starting around 16 months, he would sit with an empty apple juice container putting objects into it one at a time sayijng 'in' with each object exactly like the video does. I think he may have learned colors as well. He knows the DVD quite well and will often start making sounds for the upcoming image before it appears on the screen. If I had to guess, I'd say he's seen the whole DVD 30 times. He copies the speech therapists when they make vowel sounds and it's the cutest, coolest thing. The variety of sounds and noises and visuals of mouth movements and tongue exercises interspersed with toys keeps a child's attention and keeps them focused on developing the mouth control to speak well. People are often shocked when my son says things because he's direct, enunciates well and has a broad vocabulary for his age. I attribute it partly to this DVD. I also taught him baby sign language and talk to him ad nauseum about everything under the sun from artists to construction to whatever we happen to be passing in the stroller in NYC. I've read a lot about language and it's influence over a child's success in life so I'm quite focused on this aspect of his development. I honestly don't know exactly how many words he speaks now because some days there are multiple new words and I can't keep up. I've counted up to 60 but I know I'm missing some and he's said at least 10 new ones since then. It could be 90. Just the other day, he pointed to the sky and said ""moon"" which floored me because I can't remember the last time we talked about it and he said it perfectly the first time. He can also say more difficult words like ""upstairs,"" ""airport"" and ""flowers."" I also wanted to mention that I'm aware of the recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics that children not watch tv before 2 yo. I'd read that it not only isn't good for them but takes away from real learning time which is why I've tried to make myself available as much as possible to watch the DVD with my son and comment, ask questions or react throughout. Based on what I've seen, he's learned a great deal from this DVD. I'm not saying the AAP is wrong. I think, as a parent, you use your best judgment based on your particular child and assess along the way. I also wanted to mention that when I first got the DVD after reading so many rave reviews and watched it, I was totally underwhelmed. Give it time. It took my son 6 mos before I started seeing benefit after benefit from this product.",1369353600,,3068,4.328125

She watched this video for the first time this past weekend and we have watched it once per day since (6 days so far), upon her request. The first viewing she just watched, but the second time around she was mimicking the women on the video and repeating words I haven't heard her say consistently. Over the past week, she has started talking a lot more. I'm not saying it is solely the video, but my husband and I truly believe it has definitely helped her.

I got this DVD and instantly my daughter began to catch on. She was mimicking the therapists and saying words the same week we got the DVD. It was amazing. The concept is quirky, never thought my daughter would be so interested, but she loves it. We watch the DVD daily and I apply the concepts taught in the parents section. The dvd has great concepts and my daughter  has even picked up on the sign language. Just goes to show everyone has their own learning style and this is one my daughter thrives from.

He started on Monday and by Thursday he was sick and that Saturday morning I had to take him to the ER and he had to stay the night in the hospital.  We took him out of daycare because it wasn't worth him constantly getting sick. We purchased Baby Babble 1 & 2 hoping it would help.  Within 2 days of watching it he had learned the sign language and was using it through out his day.  He loves the videos and will watch them all day long if I let him.  The tips for parents are great.  I ran right to the dollar store and got some of the things they suggested (whistles, pinwheels, bubbles)  My son copies the mouth movements of the speech pathologists the best he can and each day he gets better.  We have had the videos for almost 2 weeks and he's saying 5 more words and able to say more sounds.  Instead of grunting and pointing he will point and sign please or sign eat.  He is less frustrated which makes it easier to teach him to communicate when he is wanting something.  I do have a dr appt set up for him next week to see if his pediatrician wants him to see a speech pathologist, but I think with his recent improvements he won't have too.

However, I have more success getting them to talk when I talk to them and ask them questions rather than having them watch this video.

I bought this based on the reviews. It seems that many people like this video, so I'm assuming it is just not for our family. I watched parts of it and it's interesting... a bit strange, but definitely interesting. I have a background in IT/visual communications and image editing, so I have to state that I don't feel the video is well made; I could have made it myself. That being said, I'm not sure the visual aspect is as important as the verbal. And honestly, I bought it for the verbal aspect, thus the 4/5 stars.

While the other children romped and yelled and played, he romped and played -- but no sound.  He had months of speech therapy with no success, nothing, not a sound. He is not deaf, he has a form of autism.

I bought this DVD, for him, for Christmas.  The reviews were so encouraging, I thought, ""What the heck, it's worth I try!"".  And, now, I can say this has been the most fulfilling purchase of my life.  No kidding.

His family came to visit a few days before Christmas and I decided to give this gift early.  We put the DVD in the VCR and all sat down to watch.  He sat down, also.  He was immediatley captivated.  He watched the entire video, which was a feat in itself, as he never before showed any interest in watching TV or DVD's for more than a few seconds.

During his first viewing he started trying to mimic the sounds.  Really!!  That afternoon, he was trying to form words!!  Honestly!  We were amazed.  This was our Christmas miracle -- on a DVD.  It has been 2 weeks since he received the DVD, now he runs and ""yells"" and plays with the other children.  He is saying ""some"" words, the progress has been tremendous.

2017324,5,B0001MXPF4,"Bought this and the level 2.  Learned a lot about how to help a speech delayed child learn words and develop the muscles in his face to enable him to speak.  Created flash cards.  Followed the exercises.  He liked teh interactive parts where he could push the DVD buttons to move things along. He learned patterns as he watched these DVDs over and over.  When he finally started to talk with the help of a speech therapist after having watched these DVDs many times, he started to speak and we found we had build a great vocabulary for him and finally the words all came out........",1356566400,,582,4.452830188679245
2017325,5,B0001MXPF4,"I have to say, at first glance of these DVD's, I was really worried my son wouldn't want to watch them.  They seem VERY VERY simple and downright bad (my older boys in their teens were making fun of it.  BUT, with my 27 month old son only speaking a few words, and my pediatrician saying that if at 30 months, he's not progressing we need to have him evaluated for delayed speech, of course I was looking for something with good reviews to try.  THESE DVD's HAVE GREAT REVIEWS (WITH A FEW NOT SO GREAT IN BETWEEN), BUT THE GOOD ONES ARE SPOT ON!!

 My son's vocab exploded within 2 weeks of receiving these. He was grunting the syllables for words he KNEW but wouldn't say and he could follow complex instructions, and he could figure out puzzles and locks after a minute or two, so we knew he was pretty smart. Imagine how cool it is to finally be called ""mama""!  I don't know how else to describe how effective these are, but to say that he went from having 10-15 words to an uncountable list (including stringing two-three together!)!  AND he asks for these DVD's to be played on his own.... not something he does with any of the others. I truly feel like his confidence went up when he found he could mimic the two speech pathologists in the DVD.  THANK YOU CORY AND AMY!!!!!!",1356566400,4,1280,4.326359832635983
2017326,5,B0001MXPF4,My son is 2 1/2 and is very speech delayed.  I love watching him watch this video.  He mimics all the sounds and attempts to repeat the words.  I highly recommend this to any parent with a speech delayed kid.,1354579200,2,208,4.15

2017328,5,B0001MXPF4,"I bought this video after my 21-mo-old son's pediatrician said we should consider speech therapy if he wasn't talking by 2 years old. He babbles and makes noise, but does not say any words. He totally understands us when we talk to him, can follow direction, and we usually know what he wants with non-verbal communication. He is very analytical and loves to do puzzles and build with legos. In other words, he is a smart little guy even though he isn't talking. I bought this video hoping to get some ideas about how to encourage him to talk at home - i.e., maybe I could do ""special"" activities with him...

At the beginning of the video are suggestions of ways parents can encourage talking - all of which I have read or seen before, such as withholding an item trying to get them to ask for it, like a ball. That does not work with my son - he just looks at us like ""duh! I know it's a ball."" So, my hopes for learning something new myself did not come to fruition.

BUT... this video has worked WONDERS for our son.  The video looks a lot like an Einstein video, with music and toys, etc. but then interspersed between those segments are two speech therapists imitating the toy sounds, and making other early speech sounds. We sit with our son while he watches it and imitate the sounds with the therapist. Honestly, watching it is a bit excruciating for an adult, just like an Einstein video, but something about this video has helped our son ""get it"" when it comes to talking. He doesn't talk during the video, but afterwards, he is a lot more verbal for hours. Now, when we ask him to say a word, he seems to understand what we want him to do and he a least makes sounds in response.

Our son now says a couple of words and he tries to say new words - I totally credit this video with helping our son WANT to talk and realizing that he CAN talk. It's like a light bulb went off in his brain and talking is now on his radar.

Needless to say, I highly recommend this video for otherwise normal children with a speech delay!",1353801600,19,2030,4.276041666666667

He began trying to talk with the first video!  We have been watching them for a couple of weeks now.  Not only is he saying most of the words and expressions with them (not totally clear, but you definatly know what he is saying) but he actually speaks ahead of the video (saying the color of the next balloon before it comes on the screen ect).

2017331,5,B0001MXPF4,"I'm the mother of a 3.5 year old boy who sits on the spectrum. My son's new speech therapist lent me a copy of Baby Babble to watch with my LO. After two months of using it here are my thoughts:

Pros:
* Focus on lip movement.  My son seems to really pay attention to the therapists' mouths as they coo out sounds/words.
* The simple sounds make it easy for my son to repeat them.
* Good rhythm. Just enough breaks to stop his frustration, but not too many that he gets distracted.

Cons:
* Really dated. I think this video was originally produced for VHS, it certainly feels that way. The producers should consider releasing an updated version with better sounds and graphics.

In addition to Baby Babble, here are some other videos that have been really helpful for my son's speech and language:

It is 2 specch therapists, that designed this to show kids what they teach in their line of work.  I got my daughter one of the toys from the video, the old fisher price phones from like 30 years ago.  The other day she was talking on the phone and I realized it was from what she saw from the dvd.  How would she know how to use a rotary, when we only use cell phones?!  Collectively, she has seen that for approximately 1 minute and she got it!  Crazy!  I already bought the 2nd one, can't wait to see how she absorbs that one!",1353283200,,696,4.0962962962962965

Not only were they all mesmerized by the visuals, after only a few weeks the older children were naming objects they saw, in English. These are children who don't even speak their NATIVE language yet, so it was quite impressive that some of their first words were in English.

The video is very simple visuals... mostly showing moving toys or objects in front of a black background. In my opinion simple keeps the attention span longer for younger children.",1352937600,,619,4.576576576576577

2017341,5,B0001MXPF4,"Just wanted to say FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!! My oldest is now 5 and she started with the original Baby Babble at about 6 months and her vocabulary EXPLODED by 1. We constantly received complements on how articulate she is. Even now, we are amazed at how well she is able to express her feeling, emotions and thoughts through language. She communicates so effectively and her vocabulary and understanding of speech is amazing. We dropped the ball with our 2nd daughter (now 2 yrs old) and it shows. Her language skills are nowhere close to her sisters and we feel we played a large roll in that by not challenging her, not playing the DVD for her and relying to much on her picking it up from her big sis. We just started Baby Babble with our 7 month old about 2 weeks ago and both my 7 month old and 2 year old are TOTALLY engaged and LOVING the DVD. My 2 year old mimics the sounds and the dancing of the marionette bear (lol). My 7 month old in just 1.5 weeks is now playing with her tongue and making more sounds. It has also reminded us as parents of our role and we are doing a lot of language play with the kids, sound consonant repetition ect. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!!! FYI, I just placed an order on Amazon for Baby Babble 2 and 3. I'm hoping my 2 year old will benefit as she just started realllly talking about 2-3 months ago and pronunciation is a struggle.

I realize its Your Baby Can Read is a totally different type of learning tool, but I wanted to point out that my older girls have never been captivated by those DVD's. Even when they were brand new. These DVD's collect dust.

Another FYI: When I first received the Baby Babble DVD I was TOTALLY underwhelmed by the packaging and then thought I had been cheated out of my money with the ""low budget"" (in my original judgment) quality of the film.  Then I watched my oldest daughter be completely captivated by it.  She watched it daily.  We would keep it on loop playing in the toy room and she would watch it while playing with her toys.  There was no fancy animation or graphics, just real people and real toys in front of a black back drop. SO basic, yet SO perfect.",1349481600,,2131,4.288557213930348

2017343,5,B0001MXPF4,"I am in tears for again but I had to tell my story and advise anyone who wants to know that this is the best speech dvd on the planet, especially for developmentally delayed kiddos.  My beautiful 6 year old son spoke his first words after watching this dvd. Something he couldn't accomplish with speech therapy alone, though he's had it for several years.  He is a survivor, against all odds of early shaken baby syndrome and extreme physical abuse resulting in traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, global developmental delays and until this dvd he was non-verbal and communicated via a few ASL signs and gestures.  He spoke his first words ever with this DVD and continues to try and vocalize.  He has learned his entire alphabet, upper and lower case and is beginning to put sounds, letters and words together. It is a simple video but in spite of his generally short attention span, he can't get enough of this dvd, and squeals with delight when I put it in, every time, no matter how many times. I bought the second one and am having the same results so today am buying the 3rd one.  He's not conversing freely, but he can clearly say Uh-Oh, Light, Love, Elmo, Sponge Bob, Yeah and and honestly this was thought by all professionals to be completely and forever beyond his ability.  I only wish I could meet these most incredible speech therapists in person.  If you are on the fence, get off and order this - if it did this for my son, I can only imagine what rewards it would offer a typically developing child.",1349395200,14,1520,4.525547445255475

At first she started screaming when the one women appeared like a ghost out of nowhere with a black back ground on the screen making a weird humming noice.  I ran into the room and played back what she had seen and could understand why. It was creepy in my opinion. I then put something else on and she was fine.

IT MIGHT BE helping too, as we've watched and practiced it four times now since receiving it this week and I have noticed more sounds and imitation coming from my child.

Will give it some more time and perhaps I can make 3 stars - 4 or 5.  I was just expecting something different than what I've already been doing at home.

2017348,5,B0001MXPF4,"Recently, someone sent us a package in the mail that included this Baby Babble DVD. I had never heard of ""Baby Babble"" before, and was curious about it so I put it on and watched to see what my son would do. My son is 26 months old, is diagnosed with Autism, and Sensory Processing Disorder and severe speech delays.

The first few times he watched it, he was very intent on it. It is very similar to the ""Baby Einstein"" DVDs in that it is colorful, has music and is fast-paced. After seeing how much he liked it, I decided to start putting it on once a day as a ""Speech Therapy"" at home kind of thing. The more he has watched it, the more he has learned to do the things on it. He has learned a few sounds, facial expressions, and he even signs with it! I am amazed at how every day he seems to learn more from it.

I know there are a wide variety of reviews on this DVD - most of them great five star reviews, but some of them not so great. The DVD is very low budget and that gets a lot of people upset. Most of the scenes are toys that spin or make music, the speech pathologists using toys, and the speech pathologists signing, or making noises and sounds. You can tell it's done in their home, and at times you can see the string or the hands ""behind the camera.""

I say all that to say this: my son doesn't care about any of that he's just a kid and I'm sure he doesn't notice. It's not supposed to be anything crazy, it's supposed to be simple and very much like you would get at a speech therapy lesson. My son has been attending speech therapy since he was 18 months old and I have seen the different methods they have used.

This DVD is right on and I like that he can have speech therapy right in our living room. He has interacted more with this video at home then he has ever done in an actual speech therapy session and that means more to me than anything! A lot of speech delays are caused by something called ""low tone,"" which relates to the muscle tone in the mouth and cheeks. My son has this problem and because of that he needs exercises that help to strengthen those muscles. Blowing, sticking out your tongue, and funny funny facial expressions are all things done on this DVD and are great for developing muscle tone in the face. My son copies those as well and I know in the past he was physically unable to do things like that because his muscle tone was so low. Through therapy it's gotten better, and I am thrilled that this DVD works on those things as well.

At the end of the DVD, the therapists give you tips and tricks to help your child learn how to talk. There is also a section for signs so that you can learn along with your child. These tips and suggestions have been very helpful to me, especially as a mother of a child with speech delays.

""Up"" has been one of my son's only words for several months now and it's so encouraging to see him interacting and doing sounds and signs with this video. I think this is going to be a big help for him and have already told his speech therapist about it. I also plan to buy the next two volumes. You can find out more about the DVDs from their website: [...].",1346284800,3,3140,4.114192495921697

I am a stay at home mom and did everything to promote speech as they do on the video beginning with her at around 6 months, but she must have gotten tired of same ol' mommy day after day and didn't want to talk to me anymore :) According to her pediatrician as long as she understands what we tell her we have nothing to worry about she will talk when she is ready (and boy does she!! sometimes I just look at her and say if you understood all of that, then I'm certain you can talk ;P ) After only 2 months of watching this video, she will bring it to us and sign ""more"" for us to put in the video. She signs drink, eat, please, thank you. (She talks away we just can't understand what she is saying, so the sign language has helped tremendously!!) She follows along making every sound, facial expression, and sign that they do on the video. We are ordering the next one in the series as we speak!

When we saw this DVD and read several dozen reviews, we were very hopeful that this would be helpful to our little one; however, that has not been the case. We have tried playing it for her several times and she simply has no interest in watching it. We even tried sitting down with her using a laptop which she is obsessed with and still a no go. It just does not get or keep her attention.

She is very engaged when she watches a television program called ""Yo Gabba Gabba!"". She actually expresses laughter and squeals during the program. At this point in her development, she does not watch ANY other television programs. We have tried introducting her to other programs and she has no interest.

As for the value of the Baby Babble DVD, the advice that the speech pathologists offer to parents is very useful to us as parents with a child who is delayed in speech. For that reason, I gave it three stars. Our daughter has received occupational therapy and physical therapy for six months, and speech therapy for the past month. From my experience with my daughter's therapies, I know that the speech pathologists put a lot of thought into the DVD, but unfortunately and with all due respect to the creators, the content meant for the child quite simply isn't enough to pull her in.",1343088000,,1393,4.612903225806452

2017359,5,B0001MXPF4,My 6 month old loves this DVD and watches it intently when I play it. I plan to buy the other baby babbles (2 & 3) as well. What a wonderful DVD for babies!,1338249600,,156,3.6176470588235294
2017360,1,B0001MXPF4,"Unfortunately, I completely agree with the other critical reviews on Amamzon. This is camcorder-quality product, with little content, mostly plastic toys being moved around together with a few repetitive sounds like choo choo.. although I really wanted to find educative value in this, I failed to find any. I bought that video when my son was 11 moths old. He was almost as bored as Mom. He's never liked it and, at 20 months,  has now totally outgrown it.",1335571200,9,457,4.784810126582278
2017361,5,B0001MXPF4,"I hesitated quite a bit before buying this video based on the many negative reviews.  My son is 3 years old, has hypotonia and has been in speech therapy since he was 19 months old.  This video replicates the activities he does with his professional speech pathologist.  Yes - It is not a slick video like the Leap Frog series - it is an honest-to-goodness insight to what a therapy session is.  It shows great tricks for the parents to engage their babies/toddler using toys to illustrate basic words such as ""UP"" and ""DOWN"".  The sign language is great.  My son knows many of the signs and signs along with the video.  With regard to those segments where the therapist is staring straight at the camera with a neutral expression making ""funny"" sounds and/or facial expressions - there is a sound reason for what they are doing.  Many speech delays are caused by something called ""low tone"" - this relates specifically to the muscles surrounding the mouth.  Delayed speakers often need exercises to strenghten those muscles.  Blowing feathers, whistles, sticking out your tongue, all those funny facial expressions and sounds are great for developing facial muscles and for learning the proper way to hold your lips to create the target sounds.  I was thrilled when my son imitated along with the therapist on the video.

I have purchased all the videos in the series and my son (now 3 1/2) still watches them (we have had them for close to two years).  He can even ask for ""Baby Babble"" by name.  He remains in speech therapy twice a week but these videos have been a great supplement to his ongoing development.",1335484800,3,1614,4.697508896797153
2017362,5,B0001MXPF4,This DVD is really great. My daughter is 18 months. she got engaged right away with it and she started imitating the sounds and signs. It almost became a daily ritual to watch the DVD together. I would say she almost learned to say all the words she heard in this DVD,1334102400,,267,4.153846153846154

2017364,5,B0001MXPF4,"This is my first Amazon review but I wanted to spread the word about how beneficial these videos have been. I bought this video after having concerns that my 20 month old was meeting and exceeding every developmental milestone EXCEPT language. His pediatrician gave suggestions and asked that I not be concerned just yet because he wasn't 24 months. However, this is my 3rd child and my older two children were in speech for articulation issues so I wanted to be proactive this time around(My older two are doing just fine now). I was very impressed with the speech therapists that my children worked with at their school. I searched online for tools to help with learning speech and came across short video clips of this DVD that was online. My 20 month old loved them so I bought Baby Babble 2 & 3. I was looking for something that will help him say more words aloud. He has great receptive language but his expressive language skills seemed somewhat delayed. After a week of watching the videos, he has been saying 10 new words and is still learning and saying more words. He dances and interacts with the videos. They seem so simplistic to me but there is just something about it that he loves. I like how the speech therapists on the DVD give him opportunities to say sounds by being in front of the screen mirroring them to him face to face. He also learned how to blow watching them! lol  I highly recommend this DVD for any concerned parent. They also teach the parents ways to interact and assist with language outside of the video. This is the next best thing to hiring a speech therapist. Now I notice that he has started to be more interactive with not only other DVDs we own (Baby Einstein) and shows he watches (Baby First TV) but with us more now too which is the most important! Thank you so much Baby Babble creators!",1331510400,,1834,4.491017964071856

2017366,4,B0001MXPF4,"I bought this because my 3 yr old was a very quick one, he talked certain times, and only to certain people.
I hoped this would help him to talk more, I used this in conjunction with, your baby can read, little einsteins, sesame street, bubble guppies, and brainy baby left brain and right brain dvd's, and I made the other kids talk to him more. So I would say all these things helped cause now he won't shut up!!

I would say give it a try, anything educational can help",1330646400,,472,4.186813186813187
2017367,5,B0001MXPF4,"If you have a child whose speech is developing at a normal pace - you may very well be disappointed with this video.  It won't be all that valuable to you and your child will learn to speak just as quickly without it.  It's main function is to help children who need speech therapy.  It is not worthless as some reviewers had stated.

If you have a little one who suffers from speech apraxia, severe articulation difficulties (beyond what is normal) or an austism spectrum disorder - this video could be very beneficial.  It obviously won't replace speech therapy, but it would be a great supplement.  I'll admit that it does look hokey and cheap.  Basically it mimics what some speech pathologists do during a session.  I purchased this for my niece who suffers from speech apraxia.  She is almost three years old and cannot speak.  (Her I.Q. is normal and she does not have autism or receptive language delays.)  As she has an intense desire to learn to speak, she is immensely interested in this video and tries to mimic the mouth movements.  I wish that I had known about this dvd when my autistic son was younger as I have no doubt that it would have helped him.",1330560000,,1167,4.504761904761905
2017368,5,B0001MXPF4,"Since my baby wanted to watch TV so badly, I decided to get him some educational videos.  This was one of them.  He's almost 8 months old.  I can tell he really likes it because he smiles and makes happy noises throughout.  As far as I know, my child does not have any weaknesses.  We just got it because it seemed like a video geared towards babies with real images and people in it.

This video is divided up into 3 sections.
1. Baby Babble - the main part that the baby watches
2. Parent tutorial - where the speech pathologists explain ways you can foster speech development with your child
3. Sign Language Demos - the speech pathologists demonstrate several signs that would be helpful at home.

The Baby Babble part is set to interesting music and shows toys while the speech pathologist ""play"" with your child using the toys.  They intersperse the scenes with the speech pathologists making weird faces or sounds.  These are my baby's favorite parts.

This is a nice low key educational video for your baby.  I recommend it.",1330473600,,1032,4.554347826086956

Our dr. recommended speech therapy, but I saw these videos and bought them to supplement at home.  My son comprehends pretty much anything you say and communicates using non-verbal cues quite well, but he doesn't make a lot of different sounds or is progressing slow and that's why we are pursuing speech therapy/this video.

I agree that the video isn't likely to win any awards for cinematography.  However, the video is still engaging and my son really enjoys it.  He laughs at things he finds funny and has already started to imitate the sounds and/or therapists.  I do wish it was longer or maybe had 2 episodes, but it's not a dealbreaker.

2017375,1,B0001MXPF4,"I got this DVD after reading all the good reviews.  I have to say it is terrifying to my 18 month old.  EVERY single time I put the DVD on he screams and cries like I usually never see.  The DVD is comprised of multiple scenes some are basic toys (such as ball drop or popper) mixed with scenes of women demonstrating how to make a noise.  The DVD is pretty boring for a child because the toys they show are really for babies.  The DVD isn't really entertaining at all, one scene is a toy fire truck with someone going ""eeee oooo eee ooo"".  There is prob. nothing in the DVD that you wouldn't do yourself naturally.  The worst part of the DVD is that the people in it are dressed in black and are standing in front of a black background so they look like floating heads.....picture watching a boring DVD and suddely a floating head comes on the screen and shouts ""eeeeeeeeeee"".  If you have ever been to a haunted house that is what you will think of when you watch this DVD.  The only thing missing is a flash light under their chins!  Cory Poland and Amy Chouinard (the makers of this DVD) have also written a book 'Let's Talk Togehter"" (home activities for early speech and language development).  My advise is just get the book it is awesome and packed with tons of activities or exercises to help guide you while you are doing your usual activies with your child such as meal time or bath time.  The book has different stages and is very ""user friendly"" anyone could understand and incorporate the exercises.  The book is $30, so don't waste money on the DVD just buy the book.  I have both DVD and book......the book was worth every penny and more I will use it for at least the next year, the DVD however, was only useful for my husband and I to put on after little man went to bed and we had a good laugh.  Honestly, an older child may not get scared as badly with the DVD but then they would be too old for the exercises in it too.............wish I hadn't got the DVD but I did laugh so hard at it that I cried!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o) FYI:  if you have a video camera at home you can make this DVD in 20 mins...really, get the book and if you want a DVD for when your away just record yourself playing with your childs toys and doing the exercises from the book.",1326844800,44,2267,4.225058004640371
2017376,5,B0001MXPF4,"I bought this for my 2 year old, he was one of those 'late talkers' and we were getting worried.  This DVD seemed highly recommended for late talkers so I thought we would give it a try.  I honestly think this helped him, not loads and I don't credit this DVD for getting him to talk solely on it's own, but he was mesmerized by this DVD and loved to watch it and would try to start saying some of the sounds.  We just popped the movie in the van when we went places and he would watch it the whole time.  Now, after watching it some myself, I have to admit it seems sorta dull and unentertaining in my mind, but little toddlers love it for some reason haha.  It's just simple and creative for little growing minds.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD and let's just say I have not gone to the effort to write many reviews on amazon, but this is one of them!",1325980800,,851,4.065868263473054
2017377,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son and I have been watching this DVD since he was 6 months old (he's 15 months old now)
We've purchased many other kinds since then but this one still is his favorite. He asks for it by making the sound of the fire truck in the beginning and points to the TV. He has it memorized from beginning to end. He will make the sound of what's to come on next. He has learned some simple baby sings like ""all done"" (which he says now), ""eat"" (starting to say eat too), ""more"", ""book"", ""ball"" and a few others. More importantly, his language skills have grown because the DVD demonstrates exactly how to move your lips to make the sound. It's like mouth exercises for babies/toddlers.
  At the end there's a very informative parent tutorial. I watch it over and over. My son likes watching it too because it shows the producers working with a baby. She does a lot of signs with her mommy and my son is very interested in watching her and mimmiking her. They should make another DVD using more babies and toddlers demonstrating what they teach. We would buy it!
  I highly recccomend this DVD. I haven't seen any other baby babble DVDs but I'm thinking about buying the P, B, M one. Although my son can say all those sounds well now. This is worth every penny. Make sure you watch it with your child and interact with them. We make a game out of it and it's a special part of our day.",1325203200,,1378,4.268199233716475

The quality is simplistic, but I wouldn't call it poor. It keeps my toddler riveted. He repeats the sounds and words, and even anticipates the sequence. We jokingly refer to it as the ""Creepy Floating Head"" video, but it is fascinating to him. I'm planning to order the second one soon. It's the only think that will keep him still.",1325030400,,607,4.333333333333333
2017379,1,B0001MXPF4,"This had so many positive reviews that I thought the negative ones were just exgaerating.  No, these DVD's really are worthless (to me at least).  Our daughter is not autistic so if it helps with those kids great but this video did not show me anything profound.  Maybe if you never talk to your kid or know how to play with your kid then maybe you may learn something but I didn't & felt like I wasted my money.  All it was a low budget movie that shows different toys & makes noise.  Like a popping toy & it goes pop pop pop.  Or flashes balloons & says up, down & what color the balloon is.  My daughter has a ball pit & I throw the balls up & say up & when she hands me balls I tell her what color they are.  Why do I need a DVD to do that?  She gets more from interacting with me.  Randomly the ladies pop on the screen & will stick out their tounge or make a sound with their lips but that's all.  If I want my daughter to stick out her tounge I show her a flash card that says tounge or simply ask her to show me her tounge.  Again, why did I pay $17 for that?  When we had our daughter evaluated by ECI & they noticed a slight speech delay even they said they aren't going to do anything magical just to keep reading, singing & doing what we are doing.  She uses signs & can communate quite effectively through gestures so I guess when she is ready she will talk & your kids will too.  Save your money & just do the usuall - Identify objects they point to, incorporate signing, read, sing & try to remember to narriate every little mundane thing you are doing.

2017381,1,B0001MXPF4,"I, too, bought this DVD because of all the good reviews. Honestly, what are these 5-star reviewers thinking? Did we watch a different DVD? I also had read the one-star reviews and thought, well, low-budget and amateurish doesn't mean it couldn't still be worthwhile in some way . . . How I wish I had listened and not bought this. If Amazon will not allow me to return it for a full refund, I'll be really teed off. They shouldn't even sell this thing.

For one, as others have said, it is extremely amateurish, filmed on a home camcorder. The sound quality is just horrendous. The toys are suspended from strings and wires that are visible. But worst of all, there is no sense to the ways in which the speech therapists have chosen to convey certain concepts. For example, a ball is put into a toy, and the word ""ball"" is spoken, then another ball is put in, and the word ""more"" is spoken, and so on. I mean, wth? When a ball is introduced on the screen, I could see a child wondering, is it a ""ball"" or is it a ""more""? The ways they chose to convey SIMPLE concepts such as ""in,"" ""out,"" ""up,"" and ""down"" were similarly botched and made no sense. A colored balloon was used going up the screen to illustrate ""up"" and then pulled down out of sight to convey ""down,"" but then moments later, balloons are popping up again on the screen in exactly the same manner, only this time, colors are being named. This is terribly confusing!! Are we learning up and down, or are we learning red and blue? The worst part of the whole DVD, however, is the one very freaky looking stone-faced woman. OMG, she is frightening. Honestly every time she comes on the screen, it feels like a horror movie in the making.

I thought that the speech therapists would be mouthing letter sounds and words, but they are not; instead they are making stupid non-letter sounds like blowing raspberries or licking lips. How does this teach language?  My children are not autistic but are a bit slow to speak so we thought this would be a good DVD for them. There is NOTHING of value here.

I cannot believe that this was allowed to be produced in its current state and that anyone actually agreed to sell it. I try to be as generous and fair as I possibly can be about items I review but, oh boy, this one was so much worse than I could have ever imagined. The Baby Einstein DVDs are not of consistent quality, I'll be the first to admit, but the ones that are good are very, very good. I was hoping this would be similar, only with a focus on language development. Instead, it appears that the makers attempted to cop from Baby Einstein with the toys and balloons and puppets, etc.

Very disappointed. Hubby and I did have a few chuckles. I guess that's something.",1323648000,9,2733,4.382642998027613
2017382,4,B0001MXPF4,"I purchased this for my 16 month old because I was concerned he was not engaging and after 2 weeks of watching the video, he said his first word. He loves to watch it and participates right along with it. It was a great buy!",1322179200,,224,4.0
2017383,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son had just two years old and was just saying mama and dada. He never went through the babble stage and we just assume he was a quiet baby. He was always very independent and very hands on. After observing him with kids his own age we knew that it terms of talking he was behind and being a teacher myself, my concerns were rising.
After talking to his doctor, I started the process of early intervention. Living in NYC he only receives 30 minutes a week. I knew that wasn't enough but I also couldn't afford anything private. I started to do some research and found Baby Babble. I read all the reviews and was eager to try it.
The video is nothing fancy, no special effects, but it captures my son's attention! He watches it daily on his request no less! He repeats the sounds and the gestures that is shown. I love watching him get excited when he does the sounds and he loves to hear the claps we give him when we see him do it.
I can't wait to try Baby Babble 2 in a few months after I see he is ready to move on. He does have a long road ahead of him but this has been a great start!",1321660800,3,1092,4.013761467889908

2017385,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son is 2 1/2 years old and is a delayed talker. He is a very shy kid and always lets himself shrink into the shadow of his older (strong-willed) sister (who is just 16 mos his senior). I've tried everything I can think of at home and nothing works to coax him to speak. I turned to this DVD based on the recommendations of other parents, hoping anything would help (in addition to getting my son into our city's public school preschool program).

This DVD may seem very simplistic on the surface, but it's perfect for young children. The two speech therapists use proven techniques to help a child gain the confidence he or she needs in order to verbally communicate. They use toys that children are very familiar with in their households and that parents can use to continue the lessons on the video. The quick segments are perfect to keep the child's attention while also encouraging them. In addition, the speech pathologists that put this together also include a section for parents that helps explain speech development in their child from a professional's point of view as well as giving invaluable tips.

My son is now starting to try to speak a little bit more and this video has been a wonderful supplement. He is a lot less frustrated than he was before and I'm noticing an overall improvement in his confidence. I HIGHLY recommend this video to any parent whose child has a speech delay.",1320624000,2,1401,4.622489959839357
2017386,4,B0001MXPF4,"I ordered this to complement the work we're doing with our 21-month-old that is rather speech-delayed. He enjoys the video, and I thought the content and approach was generally really well done. I can see how it would help parents in a variety of situations to improve some of their skills and their knowledge about helping their children learn to communicate.

That said, I was a little disappointed that the audience--particularly for the parent tutorial--is exclusively parents of younger babies that do not have any developmental challenges. The language and content assumes a child that is ""on track"" with the standard developmental milestones, and doesn't include any additional notes about modifying or utilizing the techniques for older babies and toddlers who need help communicating.

If you have a child that's delayed--or suspect you do--this kind of tool should definitely be supplemented by guidance from a speech therapist or other developmental professional. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to adding this to our tool bag. :)

***UPDATE
After about 6 weeks of watching together a few times a week, I'm really impressed how much my son likes this video and how--simple as it is--it reinforces my own skills in helping him develop his communications skills. Despite what I noted above, I definitely recommend it. Incidentally, I don't find the content and approach particularly annoying or strange, as others have commented. This is definitely a learning tool produced with a very low budget, but I don't see anyone selling this product like it's the next Little Mermaid. ! :)",1320105600,,1589,5.223529411764706

2017391,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son wasn't saying anything but ""dada"" at 9 months old.  I ordered this and it was the only DVD he was allowed to watch.  I played it for a few minutes at a time while I made dinner.  My husband and I thought it was dorky and the sounds are a little obnoxious, but my son absorbed it all like a sponge.  He started signing more, saying more, imitating the fire engine sounds etc.  One day he saw our neighbor blowing bubbles and out of the blue he said ""bubbles!"" clear as day.  We couldn't figure out how he knew that word until we played Baby Babble again and saw it there.  By 12 months, he knew all of those words and could identify the objects that go with them.  He only said 10 words at 15 months, but jumped to 100 by 20 months.  We talk to him in adult language all day long, but he wasn't repeating us.  I think Baby Babble helped kick start his language development.  He realized how empowered he felt to communicate his needs and have them understood and met more quickly. Bottom line, this works really, really well.  It's developmentally appropriate and the frames aren't too fast paced for a baby's eyes and brain.",1318291200,,1131,4.283018867924528
2017392,4,B0001MXPF4,"My daughter at 3 years old is speech delayed- we have started using this. Though she finds the therapists a little scary - she watches this program. Most of all, I appreciate the tips for parents. I have started practicing with her. In a lot of ways, this is just good common sense. But when was that ever really ""common"" huh? :-)
Oct 2011 Edit:
After a couple of months of watching. My daughter has been repeating what the therapists say and doing the signs! Its so wonderful. Ive been told to watch out that it doesnt become echolalia for her- but to try to ensure that she says things in the right context or help her understand the right context. Shes also no longer scared of the therapists!
Dec 2011 Edit:
Ok, a couple months down the line, we are ready for the 2nd dvd in the series. I really hope there are more forthcoming! Thank you!",1318118400,3,843,4.341772151898734

2017394,5,B0001MXPF4,"Our two-year-old has been ahead of the game physically and seemingly disinterested in the verbal ""stuff.""  I've often  seen her mouth the words we say, or the appropriate response to a question posed to her, but she was not mimicking the sounds we prompted or the words we asked her to repeat.  We've seen some tremendous changes in the three weeks since we started viewing Baby Babble regularly.  Her verbal sounds and words have greatly increased.  Her sisters, my husband, and I have reference points at which to play with sounds and she is ready and willing to play along.  She loves the fire truck ""e-oo,"" and the ""beep, beep"" of the cars the most, yet she loves watching the adult faces and tries to repeat and mimicking their every word and face.  Although, I must admit, it's painful to watch as it's not made for adult entertainment, it has bridged the gap from few to many words and verbal sounds and I can't thank the creators of this video enough for that.  My husband and I are both educators and have been practicing what they suggest on the video since infancy but this purchase really made all the difference.",1317427200,,1125,4.59

This one arrived just a couple days ago and my son prefers it by far to the other. Almost immediately he began to imitate the words being said. He speaks maybe a dozen words, though he understands a great deal more. This is a fun dvd that he giggles watching and is happy to practice talking with. He doesn't have any specific speech delay he just hasn't been interested or willing to. It's great being able to pop this in and listen to him practice. He had a small surgery so we have been trying to keep him as still as possible and therefore he has been watching tv and movies a lot the past few days. Bob the builder being the current favorite was actually passed over by my son and he requested to watch this dvd instead. That is amazing in our house! Highly recommended. (And he has absolutely no issue with the supposed ""scarey ladies"". I am very protective of what he watches and he just thinks they are silly.)",1317168000,,1033,4.275510204081633

A lot of reviews say that the dvd is boring and seems like a home video but i thought it was very stimulating for my son! other than ""blues clues"" this was the only dvd that would keep him engaged for the complete duration!!!

This DVD also uses toys to keep baby's attention. I laughed the DVD off the first couple of times, but I do have to say that my 15 month old likes it! She was already verbal when I got the DVD, she even recognizes quite a few written words, so I wasn't sure if this DVD would be benificial to her, but her pronunciation has improved with the first few times she watched this, not sure if it was the DVD or not but the DVD does have some benificial points. It definitely keeps her attention the whole time and she does repeat the words and sounds that they make.

We have tried Baby Einstein with only moderate interest from him but from the first time we put Baby Babble on, he was hooked. It's now 6 months later and he STILL has to watch it once a day. He looks at me, says ""Babble!"" and runs to the TV. He's watched it so many times that he has memorized what comes next so he will start to say things from the next scene before they come on.

I honestly thought it would just be a good tool for me to be able to run and take a quick shower but I noticed after a week or two of him watching that he was actually learning the words and sounds from the show. Here's some of what he started saying: ""in"", ""out"", ""down"", ""up"", ""ears"", ""mouth"", ""boo"", ""night, night"", and tons more. That blew me away. We had been trying sign language with him and it was hit and miss. After watching this for a week he really started to grasp the signing. When I watched it with him I thought one of the ladies was kind of mean looking and I was worried he would be scared but he has learned to imitate the sounds she is teaching and doesn't seem to mind that she doesn't look friendly.

I can't say enough good things for this video. Of course there will always be children that don't like this video, just like my son isn't all that interested in Baby Einstein videos while other kids can't get enough of them. So I can't guarantee that your child will have the same reaction as mine. I just wanted to share how it has helped us out!

Baby Babble arrived first and I couldn't wait to pop it in the DVD for my daughter. My wife and I watched Baby Babble together with our daughter and we were extremely disappointed. The toys used are outdated. The expressions used by the people in the video are so bland that they are almost scary (seriously)! I don't recommend this video to anyone.

2017442,5,B0001MXPF4,"This video is fabulous, as is Baby Babble 2.
First let me say that as often as we play this, I am not sick of it; it does not come into my dreams at night or float around in my head all day, and I still enjoy watching it with my daughter.
My daughter spent her 1st nine months in an orphanage in another country, and certainly rarely got encouragement to babble, or a chance to interact with anyone. At 19 months I was starting to worry that her speech was delayed as she seemed to not want to talk. Her understanding of my speech was very good; she could follow directions well; she's physically very adroit, but she did not want to talk.
We've had these DVDs almost a month and she's now very ready to talk. She has +/- 40 words. Her speech is a bit unclear, but it's improving daily. She loves these DVDs. We show them usually 2x/day, and they run about 20 minutes, so we're still under an hour of TV/day. I like to show one to her during her post nap snack/meal, because they really make her slow down and focus, and I find that she eats much better, and does a better job manipulating her fork while she's watching. And her favorite food, which used to be ""Uh! Uh!"" is now ""Eh ma may,"" aka edamame to you and me.
My husband and I will repeat the words/exercises of the DVD, and get excited at the right spots, and this seems to be a lot of fun for our daughter. Now she seems to want to try to talk for fun, and that's a huge improvement.
I read some reviews that called these videos boring or odd, but, I think that's because the reviewers are adults. These videos are like Mr. Rogers, i.e. some adults will find them boring and slow, but babies and children will find them fascinating.
Yay for Corey and Amy!",1288396800,2,1715,4.18429003021148
2017443,5,B0001MXPF4,"Our son is 27 mos and has a speech delay.  After trying a number of other similar types of videos on the market, Baby Babble was the most successful.  The techniques are most similar to those used by his own speech pathologist (because it was created by speech pathologists) and it is one of the only ones to hold his attention long enough for him to actually pick up some words and sounds.  We just got Baby Babble #2 and look forward to it as well.

It also got him practicing sounds, which he had never done before (at age four years, this was really quite something!)  I wrote to the speech pathologists who created this to thank them for their efforts because I was so happy with the results.  They wrote me back and told me that they made the DVDs with the hope that they would reach children like mine ...and typical kids too!  The only reason that I give four stars instead of five is due to the basic filming approach, which was most likely due to budget constraints.  On the other hand, the very basic filming approach may actually be considered a plus for children with special needs as there's not a lot to process all at once, but it's still entertaining.

Plus you'll find that after you watch it to with your little one that you like to do the facial expressions with them which is also a lot of fun, makes them laugh every time. Plus who would have thought that they would be learning from some silly facial expressions. She loves to repeat what I do to her, like I said they do pick up from it.

2017452,5,B0001MXPF4,"My 2 year old was diagnosed with hypotonia at 17 months.  She was unable to speak or chew correctly and began intense speech therapy and sign language classes.  While working with her home lessons provides something to do, I am constantly looking for more ways to help her.  One day while looking for more sign language  materials this dvd came up in my recommendations.  After reading all the glowing reviews, I figured it couldn't hurt.

The day it arrived I put it in and sat down with my daughter to watch.  My initial thought was ""those people are nuts"".  The video comes off like a bad 80's movie with the cheesy electronic music to boot.  A woman in a black turtle neck in front of a black back drop making horse sounds?  Toys with a voice over?  I could not believe this was what everyone raved about; however, there was my daughter watching the movie completely entranced, occassionally squealing in laughter and looking to me for my reaction.  By the second viewing she was interacting with every segment, trying to make each sound.  Now, 2 weeks later, we've ordered the second dvd as she is constantly trying to put the first one in.

While she hasn't mastered all the sounds, she tries every time.  The sign language in the dvd is very basic, things she already knew, so she enjoys doing the signs along.  While I sill haven't completely figured out it's appeal, I do know this dvd has already become an invaluable part of our resources.  Days when she's cranky and doesn't want to work on her lessons or sign, I can put this in and she'll play along without realizing she's ""working"".

She repeats a lot of words from the movie throughout the day and is becoming more descriptive, like if she sees a red ball, instead of just saying ball, she will say red ball etc.
On a side note, I personally think this is a very good movie but for some reason, it reminds me of a Clockwork Orange.  Obviously 2 very different movies, but I think it's something about the music and the way it is filmed that reminds me of it.",1281139200,,663,4.116279069767442

2017459,5,B0001MXPF4,"I bought this because my oldest daughter (nearly 3) does not talk other than the occasional ""no no no"" and very rare ""love you"". My spouse and I have talked to her docter about it repeatedly and they keep telling us to put her in day care, which is just not an option we are willing to consider. We think speech therapy is exactly what she needs, but thanks doc, no referral. So, it arrived about a week ago, I couldn't wait to pop it in and watch it with her, my first reaction was disappointment, I thought surely she won't find this interesting, the appearance is so bad, very ""home movie"". She LOVES it, she likes copying all the funny sounds and faces the women make. We play it three times a day, first thing in the morning, after nap time in the afternoon, and before bed, she's gone from only saying those two things to saying thank you, drink, eat, up, down, in, out, night night, mama (my favorite)... she even counts to five, the great thing is it teaches all these things to your child in context, so she's not just memorizing sounds.
Also, if you're worried about the ""rats sequence"" mentioned in one of the bad reviews, don't be, it's a toy mouse poking in and out of a toy block of swiss cheese, while a voice says ""in, out!""
These are great DVDs, my child's frustration level has gone down so much because she's finally able to communicate.
Background on my daughter and her difficulty with speech, her little sister was born when she was 13 months old, her development had been perfectly normal until then, but having a new baby upset her so she regressed a lot, and in my attempt to make it easier for her I made the mistake of anticipating her every desire, so she never had to ask for anything (bad mommy award).
Also, if you're concerned the 50 minute runtime is too long for your child, it's actually only about 25-30 minutes, the rest is for the parents.",1275782400,4,1877,4.3810888252149

He tries to speak as he signs the word when watching these videos.  He also owns the Trebelina DVD, which teaches how to read music, and he dances to that video.  These Baby Babble DVDs did not hold his attention at all.  Most of the words he already hears & visually recognizes from either Your Baby Can Read or Signing Time.  They do BRIEFLY go through some of the vowel sounds - and I found that to be something he has not already been exposed to.

So I highly recommend them, and to those so called experts, maybe they should get out of the lab and have some children of there own. lol",1259366400,,749,4.319148936170213
2017478,1,B0001MXPF4,"My son is 15 months old has been watching sesame street and baby Einstein videos since he was 4 months. It started with 10 minutes and increased to 30 minutes a day now.

From what I have observed, and comparing to the Baby Einstein Videos, Baby Babble was all over the place and lacked cohesion. My husband, having majored in Psychology, was in stitches after watching only 5 minutes of this video. My son was looking at us as if wanting to ask ""what is this?"". He had no interest in watching it.

To call this video ""Speech Enhancing"" is ridiculous. This is a combination of what parents can do ( making sounds for their babies as young as 2 months) and baby Einstein , only non-cohesive. Also, the color quality of the objects and the overall DVD-Quality were horrible.

I would challenge any parent to at least give other similar videos a try. You may be pleasantly surprised!

In the DVD, just two women pronounce a few sounds and words when moving toys around. They may be language experts but how can my son learn from them if the DVD can't attract him.
I actually found my son likes Disney's cartoons a lot. But there are hardly any clearly audible sounds in those cartoons. Can somebody make language enhancement DVDs based on Disney cartoon?",1258761600,7,503,4.478260869565218

When I first got the DVD and popped it in the player, my first thought was, compared to bigger budget productions like Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby, this DVD seemed inferior. But when I showed it to him, he was captivated. Why? Well, heck if I know. But he wanted to see it again and again. Then one day I was delighted when he was stacking blocks, and I heard him say, ""On top!"" every time he added a block to the stack... just like they do on Baby Babble. Then one day he started imitating the video as they said, ""Pop! Pop up!"" He has also learned some signs from Baby Babble, including the very useful sign for ""more"". He loves talking along with this DVD. This video, more than any other video, toy, or activity I've tried, has successfully gotten my son to practice his speech and learn new sounds.

2017485,1,B0001MXPF4,"I have no idea why this video gets so many good reviews. This DVD looks and sounds like speech therapists from 1970's France with too great a love for ""Space: 1999""'s soundtrack got free weekend labor from a couple of undermotivated undergrads.

Fundamentally, the DVD doesn't add anything to what parents should be doing anyway. We bought it believing it would give us ideas. Hardly. Are people so out of touch with their ""inner parent"" that they need to pay for a video of a hand pushing a toy train saying ""choooo chooooo?""

It's a 1/2 hr (+/-) of clips a few seconds long. A lady makes a silly sound. A clip of a toy with blinky lights. A cheap animation. Another lady robotically says a simple word with added sign language. Another moving toy with blinky lights...

Just because your kid watches it doesn't mean it's worth recommending. I can push a doll off the sofa 50 times in a row and my son will laugh all 50 times. Entertaining babies isn't hard.

Looking at your kid while speaking to them will be far more effective. Playing with toys is far better than a video of toys. Who doesn't make choochoos, Indian whoops, siren sounds, snake hisses and lion roars with their kids? Who doesn't go bububububble or overenunciate or turn simple words into songs?

To restate, what does this video offer that a parent can't give a child? Parents with disabilities or parents of children with disabilities may benefit, but otherwise, come on.

If you want a video that teaches your kids (and you) something new and looks like effort was put into it, look up the Baby Signing Time videos.",1250553600,20,1588,4.593639575971731

The second time I put it on, she stayed in the room and actually laughed at a few parts. She used to talk several months ago but regressed and stopped talking. After watching Baby Babble a few times, she started making a lot more sounds. She also began trying to imitate some of the things she saw, such as stacking blocks, feeding the baby, talking on the phone. Recently, she has been signing a few of the words. All of the colorful, moving toys keep her attention. She enjoys watching the entire DVD including the parent tutorial, the sign bin, and the toy bin.

2017489,4,B0001MXPF4,"I purchased this DVD for my 2 yr old after reading all of the positive reviews.  Keep in mind that every child responds to stimulus differently and it may not work for everyone.  The first time my daughter watched the video, she was mimicking the two presenters and trying to say some of the sounds.  She had said ""mama"" a few times before, but never used it in context or to call me, but after the third day- she was saying it all the time (thanks to the phone ringing in the video).  This video helped her with her vowel sounds and it also helped me to understand how to speak with her.  It definitely kept her interest, more so than the ""My Baby Can Read"" series.  I will definitely buy the second edition for her.

BTW: The ""floating heads"" are not scary, they just look like women in black and I believe it is done like that so the emphasis is focused on the facial features.  Also, it is a very simple video, no glitz and glam which is why I think it works, they are able to relate it to everyday items.  I read a review that complained about promoting the toys at the end - if you watch any Baby Einstein series or other Baby DVDs, you will most likely see that at the end.  It is so you can find any toy in the video if your child seemed interested in it.

Lastly, I noticed that some people watched the DVD without their child first.  I would recommend watching it with your child for the first time, it is meant for children not adults, so of course it would seem silly to anyone who is past that level.  That way you can watch your child's expressions and reactions to the video.  That is the only way you will be able to tell if it is useful.",1246406400,5,1654,4.128125

My son (2.5) was born 6 weeks premature and we're not sure if there is any correlation, but he doesn't speak very many words yet (less than 25 obvious words). However, we taught him sign language and he proficiently signs 300-400 words! For this reason, the Early Childhood Development program people said he shows no signs of a disorder, but is choosing to use sign language instead for now. Anyway, the point is that we have opted to encourage his sounds and speech with videos like this one. It captured his attention the moment we hit ""play"" and he asks almost daily to watch ""bubble"" (Babble). He immediately tried to mimic the sounds ""pop, pop, pop"" (to a ball popper) and ""ah-aw, ah-ah, ah-aw"" (firetruck siren). The hosts who are speech-language specialists make the noises with several toys, they also have segments that show how to form your mouth for other sounds. The videos are in the style of ""Baby Einstein"" videos and although done well, don't seem quite as ""high-dollar budget, professional"". For example, you can see the fishing line they use, some shadows, and small things. Overall, the kids don't notice and it's still a great video.

(She could understand it - but not speak.)  When we got back home we were at a bit of a loss because she didn't understand us and her frustrations grew when there was no real ability to communicate.  We try to sit with her and read books, but that only keeps her attention for a couple minutes.  Sesame Street and Elmo only keep her attention for short periods.  We read reviews on this and figured that we'd see how this might fare in helping language and keeping her interested in something.  From the moment we sat with her and turned this on she sat still, mesmerized, totally interested.  After a couple of viewings she was signing, mimicking the sounds, lip and tongue movements, etc.  Now her vocabulary is growing quickly and her pronunciation is getting clearer.  Now the words we use with her are sinking in faster and the use of them on her part are quickly coming along.  This is a fantastic DVD!",1241049600,,1143,4.5588235294117645

He's also started imitating 'Ma Ma Ma'.  We also own the entire baby bumblebee set but they're more advanced, once he starts talking I'm sure those will be helpful, but since my son needs help even making noises and moving his mouth this video's more appropriate.

If your child is a slow learner or is a late bloomer this video is a must. It took my grandson a week to start repeating what he heard and then a few more days to actually understand and put the words in the right context.
I am absolutely amazed that a video could do this but this one did.
He watches this video about 3 or 4 times a day. He repeats and knows what he is saying and it all took less than a  few weeks.
It has a really good section to help parents with the video and also has a paper guide to help parents along.
I cannot rave enough about this video . I only wish these 2 ladies would do more videos and expand on the vocabulary. There is nothing more gratifying than seeing a little mind repeat and understand what before frustrated him due to his lack of understanding.

In fact, when the lady/teacher's face is on the screen, my daughter starts crying. I even tried sitting down with her a couple times and try to get her excited to watch the video.

From a parent perspective, the toys presented and the music presented is so outdated comparing to Baby Einstein. Also, if it is a speech DVD, why are most materials about toys? I forced myself finishing the DVD. There is not much materials being taught: in/out, up/down, a few different vows...many toys being video taped in an unattractive way.

On top of that, if you return an open-box dvd, you don't get full $  back. It's a waste of time and money for me. I am surprised there is no other negative feedback about this product.",1238889600,8,1037,4.564516129032258

They are very entertaining; my daughter can watch them over and over.  However, they are light on the educational content needed to help her speak.  We then moved to Baby Bumblebee videos about a month ago. They contain the repetitive content, which helps her speak.  However, the repetition can be a bit boring; it took several tries to keep her focused.

Baby Babble combines the best of Baby Einstein and Baby Bumblebee videos; Baby Babble is both entertaining and repetitive.  In addition, there are segments with sign language and humans actually making sounds with their mouths.  Out daughter just watched it for the first time tonight.  She was captivated; she started iniating and repeating some words without prompting.

Every child is different, but I recommend that people start with Baby Babble and then go to other brands. Rather by buy one video that is entertaining, another that is repetitive, yet another that has sign language, etc., buy one video, Baby Babble.",1238025600,3,1092,5.016666666666667

The toys are there to stimulate your child so they can sneak in the good stuff in between.  Most of the toys are so old you can't buy them anyway!  Second:  There are plenty of things to get your child to practice how to talk.  ALL of the ""fun"" things they are doing with their mouths are activities/exercises geared toward speech.  It's like dominoes- you hit one, they all start to fall.  You start with mouth exercises and sounds, and then the talking comes.  Not that hard to get people, really!  Third:  Yes, it has an at-home feel to it.  So what?  In this age of Disney, a little personal type work is refreshing.  Does everything has to be so in-your-face stimulating?  Let the child use some of thier own imaginations once and awhile.

Off my soapbox.  Great video!  My little guy is responding wonderfully to it.  He does all the mouth exercises and signs and is starting to try to pronounce his own words.

Otherwise the actual part that your child is supposed to watch leaves something to be desired.

I thought that this video was a good idea but poorly made. I probably would not buy it again even if they lowered the price. For those who are still interested in buying the video I would wait until it falls below $10.",1230681600,,863,4.427672955974843
2017517,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son is 19 months old and he's not that verbal. I was hestiate to buy the dvd. I read several of the reviews and it seemed that so many parents were pleased with it. Well, I got the dvd a couple of days ago and my son has watched it 3-4 times. The video holds his attention and he actually mimic what's being done on the video.  And he will say more, help, pop, bubble and will sign more and help. Also, he will make the sounds. I'm telling you he wasn't doing this last week.  I am amazed. He just started saying mama, which I think is great. I was very happy to finally hear him say mama. Several reviews discuss the quality of the video and how poor it is. I'm not concerned with it. What I do know? My son has said more words in the last couple days prior to watching this video. And it was worth the money. I also bought baby babble 2.

Happy to hear my son words.",1229126400,,871,3.9375

2017519,4,B0001MXPF4,"My son just turned 2 and has been diagnosed with a developmental and speech delay.  After reading the reviews we decided to buy this video for him.  Yes, it isn't as fancy as Baby Einstein, but my son doesn't care at all.  He loves the toys, the music, and the women who make the ""faces.""  In fact, some parts of the video make him totally crack up!!  After a few days of watching it, he is already repeating the vowel sounds and attempting the sign language communication (help, more, eat).  His therapist and I have already noticed a slight decrease in his frustration levels as he tries to tell us using more sounds what he wants.

I purchased my copy at clevershopper.com and went ahead and purchased Baby Babble 2 from there today.  Shipping is only about $3 if you get regular first class mail, and the DVD, itself, is slightly discounted.

It's scary when professionals tell you that your child has a problem, but I'm confident these videos will be an aid to this coming year of therapy.  If anything, just watching the parent tutorial section helped me become more aware of what I should be doing to help.",1228780800,,1113,4.52
2017520,5,B0001MXPF4,"I not only see the benefits of this video as a speech pathologist, but also as a mother. I recently purchased this video for my 14-month-old, and he absolutely LOVES it! None of his other videos hold his attention like this one does. It did not take him long to start making the sounds that they use with the toys, like ""pop, pop, pop"" and he genuinely tries to interact with the women and toys on the screen. The women who created this video are experts on speech and language development; they have done a wonderful job demonstrating techniques to use with children with speech/language delays and typically-developing children as well. While the video holds my son's attention, I know that I must implement the techniques with him throughout the day, and not let the learning stop when the video is turned off. That is a great feature of this video- the SLPs give a tutorial for parents on how to implement these techniques. Also, I often sit with him and make the same sounds and faces that the women/toys do. He loves that I find the video as interesting as he does, and likes to make the sounds/faces with me. This helps to make it even more of an interactive experience instead of parking him in front of the TV and leaving him there (although I understand, sometimes we moms need a second to ourselves to get something done as well!).

I have read some reviews where parents found the women ""creepy"". However, the reason the women stand so still and are dressed in either black or white with the same colored background is to accent their facial expressions/movements so that children will focus on them instead of a distracting background. Most children will not be ""creeped out"" by this unless they sense that their parents find it unusual. Children like playing and making silly noises and faces; most kids enjoy this.

While the video quality is better in the Baby Einstein videos, I have found them to be much less engaging and I can't get my son to watch them. I figure that I can deal with less-than-perfect video quality as long as the content is high-quality and beneficial for my child's development.

I highly recommend this video!",1228521600,,2150,4.652631578947369

Well three months later and these worries have been put to rest. My daughter now won't watch anything else and, and really enjoys her daily dose of baby babble, repeating the words, and sounds as she watches. The dvd's are done in a fun and interesting style, and even my wife and I don't get tired of watching them with her. The parent tutorials are very useful, and give guidance on how to keep encouraging speech patterns and practises. Our nine month old daughter likes to watch as well.

By the 4th time he watched them he was repeating all the sounds on the video. Now at 22 months he is all of a sudden talking up a storm. I think he needed the basic sound building blocks that are taught in these videos (we have Baby Babble 2 also). I wish we would have gotten them sooner.

He is behind me watching this video as I write this saying, ""blue, pink.."" to the feathers falling segment.  Amazing.  This IS a video to watch with your child as only you can add to the learning and experience.  As a tool - very useful... so if you want to talk to your child and hear their voice this is a good bet.

He loves the first edition, but doesn't care for the second one (I'm not sure why!).  I consider him a ""late talker"" although he does make attempts to speak with gestures and sounds.  He was evaluated by a speech therapist, who determined his speech was that of a 12 month old.  Although his speech therapist encouraged me to use other methods, I truly feel that these videos are quite effective.  My mother purchased a portable DVD player for my son to watch the movies on, which he loves.  It gives him a sense of ownership (he get's to watch HIS movie on HIS personal DVD player) and the movie is quite engaging and entertaining.  I started to see an improvement with his speech almost instantly.  I would recommend that parents/caregivers watch the movie WITH their child, instead of letting the movie ""do all the work"" (which is why I emphasize that this is a good TOOL for speech development).  The DVD's are designed to help children mimic sounds and sign language, which my son does all the time now.  I would recommend it to any parent.  There are parent tutorials at the beginning and end, which are helpful.  My only regret is that I didn't discover these DVD's earlier!

These two videos practically put her in a trance!  Since she was 6 months old, she's been giving her undivided attention to these shows and since about 9 months babbles along with the people in the video.

She's a year now and still isn't really picking up words yet-just the sounds.  However, we do communicate slightly through the basic sign language, which decreases her/our daily frustrations and sets her up for success when attempting to communicate her wants and needs.

These videos are worth the price for the hours I've gained during the past 6 months to get some work and chores done for myself while she is having fun learning.

Be advised though, this is a video which really only works if you reinforce the exercises often and integrate them into your daily communication with your child.  Babies may be entertained by the show but the learning begins with your interactions.

This is a great present for new parents and their children!  My daughter loves it.",1206057600,,1105,4.768421052631579

It's not very musical nor ""happy"" at all. Really very serious. The woman making the vocal noises (like the soung of a Fire Truck or just bu bu bu) never smiles and the DVD is by no means fun. Even the sign language is very seriouse with no smiles, laughter or music. In my opinion, NOT what babies need.
Baby Signing Time with Rachel Coleman is absolutely full with songs and music while showing the signs and that makes it easy to keep babies attention.  It's thanks to the Signing Time DVD's that at 12 months my little one signs over 20 signs, showing me what she thinks, wants and how she feels.

It teaches sounds and concepts, not just showing a bunch of things like flash cards.  The first few signs he learned like ""eat, more, and all done"" were life-savers and cut down on a lot of frustration for my son.  He has also learned a lot of objects as well as words to decribe things (up, on top, in, etc.)  He likes to tell us little stories!  For a toddler, I recommend Baby Einstein's Baby Wordsworth to expand his/her vocabulary of objects.  But for a baby, Baby Babble is the place to start for understanding and communicating!",1182643200,2,852,4.516339869281046
2017560,5,B0001MXPF4,"I purchased this video for our youngest child, who at 19 months was not talking as much as her siblings were at the same age. I only wish I had done it sooner! The first time we watched it she said ""up/down"", ""in/out"", ""ball in"", etc...for the first time, and learned all of the signs instantly- signs she still uses although she speaks in sentences now and doesn't need to sign. At 25 months our daughter loves this video and wants to see it over and over. She even likes the parent tutorial!
The creators of this video did an excellent job of pacing this video in a way that holds the baby's interest, while educating the parent at the same time.
I will give this video to friends who are expecting their first baby this summer; this is a great gift for a new parent.",1181692800,2,769,4.273972602739726

He would pick his toys up and set them down without doing anything with them, or toss them, or carry them as he spun in a circle. It didn't change no matter how much Floortime I did with him. After watching this dvd once/day for 2 weeks, that changed. For example, he'd pick up his firetruck and push it along, saying, ""wee-ooooh, wee-oooooh,"" like a siren. He picked up his toy phone and said, ""hello? hi! ok, bye-bye,"" and hung it up, just like they did in the video. His speech therapist was amazed.

This video is different from some of the other ones I have because it shows adults  making sounds and funny faces, and it uses 'baby talk' to help the babies learn.

However, this 45min program still grabs his attention after a few months! I like that they seperate learning with a few minutes of visual simulation breaks. The first two times he watched the video intensly. By the sixth time he was imitating the mouth gestures he was seeing by the pathologists on the video. What I couldn't believe was not only he was trying to imitate the sounds but he picked up the signing of eat, more, and please within the second week! To have my now 20 month old signing please with EVERYTHING he asks for is such a reward to an already stressed mom! By the DVD or VIDEO - it's worth every penny.",1177200000,3,913,4.440476190476191

Our pediatrician had suggested that we look into some sort of speech therapy for our boy because at 18mos he was slightly delayed. We did the hearing test and he passed so therapy was going to be our next step. I was reluctant to get this video because our son is a hard sell unless the words ""Baby Einstein"" are in the title. He LOVES it. Not only does it keep his attention but he started copying all of the sounds within the first couple of weeks and he learned how to use the baby signs that are shown in the video. We took two signing classes but he didn't get it until he watched the video. As parents we appreciate the tutorial portion of the video (which my son also watches)because we have a five month old and it gives us tips on how to encourage speech at an early age.

This DVD was instrumental in getting my son motivated to even attempt to make a sound.  I recommend it to anyone who has a speech-delayed child.  I wish I would have had it for my older son's articulation speech disorder.  My youngest began to use it at 4 or 5 months to ensure proper speech development.  She loved it!!

Yeah he could point and do things we needed him or wanted him to do and knew what things were but as far as saying what they were when he did it was never shown.  I heard of this video through AMAZON and read most of the over 100 reviews to make sure that this video was actually worth buying and not another kids tape which will be shown once, he won't find it interesting and stored up with the others collecting dust. We purchased the video and the very day it came popped it in the VCR and it was like magic! He was in AWWWW!! Its like he had never seen anything like it. The lady with the ""floating head"" as others say, is NOT scarey at all.  My son loves her the best and imitates her faces and noises. He has even started to realize that the babysigns I have been doing with him are a means of communicating since the ladies on TV do them.(he can do ""more and all gone"")
In a matter of 3 weeks, he is saying ""up, down, ball"" among others and will even imitate the games that they play such as all the toys in and all the toys out.  We play the video once a day, usually at a more relaxing part of the day before daddy comes home or after dinner.  He even said MAMA!!! Now if that doesnt just make you want to cry!!
For those Bargin shoppers: I found this tape on Clevershoppers.com for MUCH cheaper than AMAZON or Ebay.

These are things we have been working with him and getting inconsistent results, but this video seemed to really reinforce the ideas.  He absolutely loved it and wanted to watch it again and again.  The tips they give are all things we learned with our speech therapist, but it helps to review them.  The use of signs is also wonderful!  Even my 4 month old seemed to be interested in it.

Our 27 month old had less than 20 words in her vocabulary and we were looking for some intervention that we could start while waiting for a speech evaluation and therapy sessions.  We were amazed at the results!  In just 3-4 weeks of watching the DVD several times a day, our toddler picked up over 50 words, learned all animal sounds, learned concepts such as ""more"" and ""uh-oh, fall down"", learned to count to 5, and so much more.

He watched this video until he was about 3.  Then he didn't really have any interest because the video was beneath his level.  At 3, he was about 6 months behind in speech.  Now he is 4 and he is at an age appropriate level.  We tried many other speech videos when he was two, and it was hard to find one that kept his interest enough to watch it.

This video has gentle music in the back ground with bright colored toys and the occasional vocalization or sign.  I have to say the speech paths in this video do not look very happy - almost somber.  I suppose the reason is to minimize distraction from the task, but they could smile a little more!  If your kids like up-beat, bubbly, fast-paced lyrics-to-the-music style of entertainment - Along the lines of Barney or Sesame Beginnings - this DVD is less likely to satisfy him/her.

2017593,5,B0001MXPF4,"I stumbled across this video in December 2005. After reading many reviews, I ordered it for my micro-preemie daughter who was 14 months old at the time. I can't say enough good things about this DVD. I have read the complaints of others about it not being as ""professionally produced"" as Baby Einstein, etc., and frankly, it is not a polished big budget video. However, the CONTENT of the video is outstanding. The video was made by two speech pathologists, who emphasize proper language development. Every early intervention specialist that I have told about this video was extremely impressed with the emphasis on developing proper sounds and speech through very simple, repetitive phrases, sounds, facial expressions, and sign language.

Now for the critic that really matters; my daughter. She absolutely LOVES this video. From the very first time she saw it she was mesmerized! She is now almost 26 months old and she still loves it. It is by far, her favorite video. When it is on, the world around her simply stops because she is so focused on her movie. She has definitely benefited from the repetition of watching Baby Babble. She repeats sounds and phrases from it as well as sign language. We are a very language rich home and we are always talking and interacting with our children, so we are not using this as a substitute for interaction with her. Instead, we use it as another tool in encouraging her language development. It is inevitable that she is language delayed; she was born 16 weeks early, so we do everything we can to help foster proper language development. Even my gifted 6 year old son enjoys watching Baby Babble with his sister, and gets so excited when she repeats words, phrases, and sign language from the video.

It also has parent tutorials that are very informative about language development, sign language, and activities to do with you children to encourage language development.

If you are looking for a video that will have a tremendous effect on your child and his language development, look no further than Baby Babble. It is by far the best $20 I have ever spent.",1165881600,4,2109,4.804407713498622
2017594,5,B0001MXPF4,"When I first viewed this DVD with my 11 month old it seemed really badly made and boring to me. Wierd looking women, cheap toys and not much to hold my attention. However, my son has absolutely loved it from day 1. His first imitation was the fire truck siren sound. He is now 15 months and has a vocabulary of 25-30 words, most of which come from this DVD. He has completely memorized the video and anticipates each section before it starts. He loves watching the video, but more importantly, I think it has taught me to speak with him in a way that helps his language development. I have started using repetitive phrases like ""on top"", and he understands and repeats those in various contexts.

As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the production quality is bad compared to Baby Einstein or other big-company-DVDs. But that doesnt matter in the least to my son. In fact, the simple and older toys used really help focus on basic actions (""ball in"", ""on top"", ""push"") rather than a lot of distracting images.

He wasn't babbling at all at 11 months, which is why I got this video, but now he is in the advanced category for speech. It might be a coincidence but I think this DVD has really helped him, and taught us how to speak with him.",1165622400,2,1249,4.426086956521739

As soon as it started, he stopped what he was doing, and watched intently.  He sat on my lap and I repeated a lot of what was being said, but he was transfixed on the screen.  On the second day, I played the dvd again, and this time he smiled and started babbling nonsense, then would try to repeat a few sounds and words.  I think the dvd is awesome.  I don't know what it is about watching it on tv, but it works for him.  I tried doing the sounds and words on my own, but it wasn't as effective.

There are a few parts that make him nervous--the metal star thingy and when the blocks fall over. It may be the music.  I can say that even though he still isn't saying much, he has picked up on some signs used in the video and he is making more noises, like buzzing like a bee and vroom like a car.

The two therapists focus on speech production with focusing on their mouth, movement and placement of lips and tongue too.  Also, they add sounds of the toys that you see, and the toys are very visual and educational.  My son is speech delayed and within four days of watching this video, everyday at least once a day, he added five new phrases to his vocabulary and learned to stick his tongue out and be more aware of his own mouth.  He requests this video every day, and I would encourage anyone with a child with speech delay to try this video. I think it is very well done and the video is clear and professionally made.

After about a month I stopped watching it because he started to seem disinterested..... Well he is now 22 months and he hasn't watched the video in over two months and he's now started to talk. If I put our camera in front of him and tell him to say ""cheese"" he repeats ""cheese"". He says ""uh-oh"", ""dog"", ""hi"", and a few other words he wasn't saying three months ago...

2017602,4,B0001MXPF4,"I'm very sorry that I didn't find this video a bit earlier in my child's speech development.  She's just over two, and just a little bit delayed, so this video wasn't much help for her.  It says it works for 3-30 months, but I think that it's aimed toward a level of development that my daughter is already past.  BUT, I will say that the techniques used are very good, and I plan to use it for my 4 mo daughter starting now.

These are the very same things I should have been doing to encourage my oldest's speech development, but I was too inexperienced a parent to do so.  Again, I would mostly advice this video for parents of younger children or older ones who are more significantly speech delayed.

Be warned, you don't just put this in the DVD player and forget about your child for a bit.  If you start using Baby Babble with your child, that means that you have to do some work, too.  Learn the signs, learn how to reinforce the lessons throughout your normal day.

I love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the DVD. My son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days. The video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development.

She wears a black turtleneck on a black background, so she looks like a floating head.  But not a joyful floating head.  A scary one that makes strange noises and facial expressions.  It even made me uncomfortable.  The production value also looked cheap compared to other DVDs like My Baby Can Talk.  The lighting, color and art direction was bad.  I had to turn off the video after five minutes because my child had this frightened look on her face and started to cling to me, and I don't blame her.

Whenever she appeared on screen, by daughter would burst in tears (while she no longer cries, she does appear frightened).

There is very little in this video to aid in talking. Many of the expressions of the women (Speech Pathologists) in the video are either almost scarry or just plain bizarre. The quality of the video is very ""camcorder like"". We've got the entire series of DVD's of just about everything out there for a child, but I never thought any were cheap/poor quality until I saw this one.

During the video you will see: A stoic woman sticking her tongue out; rolling her tongue; slurping followed by a cheap toy suspended by a string with no attempt to hide it.

There are a few signs that they teach within the dvd, like how to sign, ""thank you"", or ""drink"", but there couldn't be more than 10 the entire dvd.

2017619,5,B0001MXPF4,"As a person that deals with adults on a daily basis, interaction with how little ones was not my forte.

Our child was not picking up some of the speech milestones set by our pediatrician at 18 months. She was mildly concerned about our son not speaking -- of course looking at a medical perspective. The recommendation was for a hearing test, which he has normal hearing. Her next recommendation would be a speech pathologist to work with him.

Well, I beat her to the punch and purchased this video. The video contains drills that a speech pathologist use. Our son was not slow on speaking, but the parents (us) are slow on helping a baby learn to speak. The great thing about the video is that it gives drills on how to communicate with your child by words and sign language. After repetition, he can say a couple of words and knows how to ask for help if he needs something.

Our son now asks for the video on nearly a daily basis. He is not quite saying movie yet, but trying! The child section is about 25 minutes, long enough to keep his attention.

As mentioned in some other reviews, the quality is not top-notch but he does not care. The content is more important than the pictures. And yes, we also purchased ""My Baby Can Talk"", which focuses more on signing than speaking. Baby Babble has speaking and sign drills. Both videos compliment each other.

I especially recommend this video because many books only address a medical problem, not ""parenting skills for dummies"". Our son is on his way to learning to communicate and we have a kickstart on how to communicate with our toddler. Bring on baby number 2!",1150329600,10,1620,4.515358361774744

He's even using a couple of signs when up to this point, he did not model our signing at all.  He also follows all of the oral motor exercises.  I find it to have good sound and video quality, unlike a previous viewer.  It gets 4 rather than 5 stars from me simply because I would have liked to see more words being modelled such as ""phone"", ""cup"", and ""toy"".

It brought almost instant relief to our family.  Suddenly my son was letting us know when he wanted something to eat or drink by signing rather than whining while we guessed what he wanted.

Soon we heard these words and saw the signs carried into everyday play and requests, it was quite amazing.  We wished there was a Baby Babble part 2!

The Baby Bumble Bee videos did not provide a human element and did not hold my child's attention as they are too long and provide little more than a run-on of DVD flashcards.  The biggest benefit of these videos is that they promote language, offer a familiar scenario very similiar to what is provided and said in an SLP and often ABA therapy session.  My daughter watches it 1-2x/day and since has gone from just making one limited sound to run-on gibberish sentences - sprinkled with words here and there.  We firmly believe this is an excellent reinforcer to her therapy sessions to promote language.  Thank you for creating.

This has been very good as it shows sign language for some requests.  The sign language is beneficial for me to use and so when my son points instead of asking, I show the sign since I know what he wants.  And it prompts him to ask for ""More"" or to say ""please"" and ""thank you"".  The speech pathologists on the video were good.  You see their faces as they show various mouth/tongue  exercises and how to make sounds.  I appreciate them and wished they had another video for those of us with older toddlers with speech delay.  I'd say that this video is geered best for the baby audience of 6+ months to 2 years.  But since my son is speaking on the level of an 18m-2yo, this has been beneficial for us.  Our problem is getting our son to speak sentences or even two to three-word phrases.  I would like to see a sequel to Baby Babble to work on phrases/sentences.  My son simply loved the scence with the toy telephone.  I recommend this.

I love how they mix in signs, sounds and facial expressions. My only ""complaint"" (and i hesitate to call it that) is how the one woman (Amy?) isn't smiling/grining when she does the sounds and facial expressions. Maybe she's not suppose to so that the child will focus more on how to mimic her, but she just looks so ""dumpy"" instead of friendly.

I found the 10 signs sign language tutorial helpful (I think it is baby signs and not ASL; my son only has 4 fingers and both his thumbs and couldn't do ASL right now anyway) as reading a book and trying to figure out how to do the signs can sometimes be confusing.

My daughter turned 3 today and has not been talking much and we have had tests and tried different programs and had speech pathologists coming to the house and working with her and the results are good but slow....well, she watched this dvd over and over and now recites it with the people on the screen, she tells us when she wants to eat...by saying it AND signing it....drink, yes, no, up, down, in, out, hello mama...ok...bye bye.  I am amazed and told all her teachers about it...they are going to recommend it to their other families.  If you are thinking of buying a copy of this....do it!

He watched it only once so far and he could not take his eyes off of the screen.  He started to get speech therapy a month ago but has yet to make any progress.  It was comforting to see that they use the same techniques that his therapist is.  The format is similar to that of the Baby Einstein videos so I knew he would enjoy it.  He knows his ABC and 123's and at the end they show words with their accompanying sign and he read the word off the screen-I was floored.  I hope that this is the help he has needed.,1137024000,,613,3.7874015748031495

The parent tutorial included on the DVD is excellent as well and helps my husband and I work with our daughter independently on increasing her speech.  The video also keeps her interest through the entire thing.  We also got her ""Baby Wordsworth"" by Baby Einstein and she only will watch that for a few minutes before loosing interest.

It has also helped reinforce such concepts as up and down and help. She loves this video and if given a choice, will choose it every day.

My 14 month old is also enjoying it, and my older kids love the sign language at the end.

The production on this program is not as 'slick' as the Baby Einstein products but my kids don't care a bit. If you have a child with atypical language development or a language delay, you should get this disc!",1135296000,3,606,4.5

However, the speech pathologists on the DVD knew exactly what they were doing!  Clever productions, attention grabber sounds, eye-catching facial expression, and good intro of signing.

In fact, as far as encouraging late talkers, we would rate this one up there with ""The Miracle of Mozart Numbers and Shapes"".  ""The Miracle of Mozart"" takes a different approach by using kid's voices to entice children to repeat what they hear.  This DVD uses Speech Therapists and is really useful in motivating our non-verbal toddler.  It will also show you how to promote language.  I can see why the parent of a typical child with normal speech development might not be impressed with this product- but if you are a parent looking for something to help promote language, this is a great choice.

At first, I was concerned that this video wouldn't hold his interest because it seems more geared for a younger child.  But, to my surprise, I've been able to get him to watch it with me, and together we imitate the sounds and words.

I have every day toys at home and she can stare at those all day long.. I want and are looking for useful skills that a proffesioal can teach me and my child.

I've seen a few reviews that compared the quality of this DVD to Baby Einstein or the appearance of the individuals appearing in Baby Babble.  The bottom line is this, it's about helping your child enhance language skills.  If it holds his or her attention and it works, the quality is besides the point.

This video uses the strategies that they are learning in their speech therapy. Plus, it gives great ideas for parents to use with their kids.

2017666,5,B0001MXPF4,"This video is the best I've seen for enhancing speech. I bought it when my son was 19mos old and only had two words in his vocabulary ""Go"" and ""Ball"". When I first played it for him he watched it intently but didn't seem to respond to it verbally. At 24 mos old he has been in speech therapy for three months and his vocabulary now consist of about thirty words/signs. Some he will speak,some he will sign or both. Some he understands but doesn't yet speak or sign (receptive language is just as important as spoken language). I pulled the video back out and started playing it for him at bedtime while in his crib(this way he isn't distracted). I hear him talking with the video. Not only does he repeat the sounds he hears but he says the words. He also laughs,sings and dances to it. Alot of it mirrors what he learns in his speech therapy. But that is the beauty of the video-to have a speech therapist in your home. I have only been playing it for him for a week and he is beginning to memorize the video. I noticed he is telling me what comes next on the video. I couldn't believe it when he looked at me and signed please and said ""peeezzz"".I looked up at the video and the next thing I knew the speech pathologist in the video came on and signed and said ""please"". He will go through the vowel sounds with the stuffed animal but he will say what is coming next. Before the bear came on and ate a few carrots my son rubbed his tummy then said yummmm. Then he pretended to eat a carrot too. The video may not appeal to an adult audience but that isn't what it is designed for. It is an educational tool for children. I really like how the women in the video are dressed to blend into the background so the focus is on their mouths. The sounds may appear silly to an adult but are important to speech development. The video gives ideas for how to play with the toys he already has while encouraging speech through play. Just this week he has learned the meaning of up and down. I saw the use of balloons for ""up"" and ""down"". I did the same with a balloon left over from his birthday party. I said ""down-down-down-down"" as I pulled the string down and ""UUUUUUUUPPPP"" as I released it and WOW after 3 times he had it. Believe me the small amount you pay for the video is worth it when one 30 minute session of speech therapy costs me $75. I just wish I hadn't been so quick to put the DVD away for those few months when he didn't respond as I had wished when he was first introduced to it. It truly is worth the small price tag. If you are a parent whose child has the slightest speech delay buy it.

After watching it a couple of times he began doing the signs for more and for help along with the lady on the video.  He is also making the E and I sound.  Before he made no vowel sounds.  He is communicating a little better since viewing this video.

I also purchased the Baby Einstein Wordsworth video that was just released.

2017669,5,B0001MXPF4,"My son is 25 months old and was just diagnosed with a speech delay.  I was hesitant to buy this video because there are a few reviews on this site that comment on its poor quality and that it doesn't hold children's attention as well as others.  But all the videos I have researched online to help with speech delay seem to have negative comments.  I finally decided to buy this video (because it was made by speech pathologists) and Baby Bumble Bee's Vocabulary Builder #1 (because it repeats the words several times).

The first time I played Baby Babble for my son, I sat and watched it with him and tried to encourage him to make some of the sounds and try some of the signs.  He watched intently from start to finish, but he was not responsive at all.  Good thing I didn't just store it away with all the other videos, because the second time I played it for him, I was preparing dinner in the kitchen, and much to my surprise, heard him babbling in the living room.  It turns out that he was mimicking some of the sounds and facial expressions on the video. This from a child who has NEVER mimicked anyone!

Now when we watch the video together, and the women make facial expressions, he looks to me to see how I respond and then he tries the expressions himself. I'm not sure why, but his favorite part is at the end when the bunny (or is it a puppy?) makes vowel and consonant sounds.  I'm proud to say that he can copy each one!  2 weeks ago, he would have never done such a thing.  I hate to admit it, but he's learning better from this video than from his own family.

By the way, he likes the Baby Bumblebee video too, but he just sits and watches that one in silence, like all the Baby Einstein and Sesame Street videos I was hoping would get him to start talking.

It has a lot of sensory movement which I feel is vary appropriate for our son.  The visualization of sounds by the therapists is quite advantageous.  My son is fixated on their mouths and tries to mimic their lips.  My daughter's speech thrapist has continuously aske to borrow it because other families want to see it,too.  I am purchasing two more of  them (another for myself and one as a donation to our local library).  I like Baby Bumble Bee, too.

She would much rather watch her Brainy Baby video. I truly believe in signing to help babies communicate, though. I've seen it in action with my nieces. However, I recommend just getting a baby signs book and engaging in some conversation with your baby. Then, get a Brainy Baby video for entertainment. Please note that both were VERY cheaply made.

My 3 year old son has a mild speech delay, and his words have become much clearer and he loves to enunciate the sounds and exaggerate the facial expressions like the women in the movie.

I also have a 13 month old son, who started watching this at 8 months.  He was 2 months premature and we expected severe delays in speech, both from the prematurity and family history.  He is now advanced in his speech patterns, and has several understandable words, as well as ""Daddy"" and ""Mama"".

This DVD is like having a speech therapist visit your house every day.  Not only has it helped tremendously, but all three boys love watching it and anticipate their favorite scenes.

He was interested for about a minute and then went to play with his legos. The video quality is very poor and does nothing to hold a child's interest. Anyone could make this video with a camcorder and some colorful toys.

Not impressed at all.",1114473600,7,390,4.492957746478873

sessions once or twice a week, and are making some slow but steady progress.

I've played it once or twice a day for Kyle

for the past two months.  He voices along with the vowel sounds

(aaaah-eeee-oooooh--oooo), and now does that around the house even when the

video is not on.  It really is very helpful to reinforce what's happening at

our speech therapy sessions, and I think Kyle likes the fact that he now

anticipates what's coming.  (His little brother, 3 months, likes it too.)",1113177600,6,587,4.712871287128713

Althought, I do not believe it has significantly contributed to expediting her speech development, she is now slightly above-average in the number of words she knows and uses.  I first noticed the impact this DVD had when at 12 months, she held a balloon and said up/down, lifting it up and pulling it down. Most importantly, I find that this DVD is exceptionally engaging and will hold her attention the entire time it is on.  This was true at 6 months and is true at 18-months also.

We have some of the same toys used in the video and she even plays with them in the same manner the video does.  It really has improved her babbling and talking.

That said, it is low budget in terms of filming -- but then, my 13 month old daughter doesn't notice this.  It's a keeper!",1104105600,2,401,4.142857142857143
2017695,2,B0001MXPF4,"Somewhat unprofessionally done- lots of shadows.  It is sometimes hard to see what the speaker is signing due to the angle of the camera and the lighting.

Many sequences are very very close- almost to the point of ripoff- to Baby Einstein videos.  Same type toys, same bodiless hand doing the shape sorter, etc. only not as crisp or as well done as Baby Einstein.

My baby is only 9 months old, so perhaps her interest in this video will increase, but I can say that she is incredibly interested in ""My Baby Can Talk"" which is a similar style sign language video.",1103500800,6,564,4.446601941747573

I only wish I would have known about it when Enzio was younger...I concentrated on all the baby Einstein videos which now when I look back on how wonderful I thought they were...I relize that they weren't, not for language skills anyways they hardly use language in there videos. This video was created by SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS which is why it really touches on language/sign language. Don't hesitate to get this one...you won't be waisting money. They use alot of sounds and show you some basic sign language to help your child communicate better so they are not so frustrated. I only hope they come out with more videos like this one, My son watches this with me every day and we do all the sounds & signs. My son just went to have his hearing tested and to be evaluated for language delay and when the patholigist were playing with him I felt like I was watching this video, they did almost everything that is in this video. His language is already improving. This one you can pop in and if you have to catch up on laundry,dishes etc you won't feel quilty.",1102636800,9,1282,4.478632478632479

After about 4 weeks though, the video (DVD)is wearing out we have to constantly restart it.  These speech therapists should make an entire series.  Great stuff.",1101945600,,497,4.72093023255814

This DVD has also helped me to realize what I was doing wrong when I try to teach him something.  Baby Babble has taught me to break things down to a more simple and understanding way to teach my son.  Before, I would try to over-do things for him and I think that is why he would get frustrated and give up.

NOTE: I also changed him to a soy toddler formula b/c he most definitely has a cow milk sensitivity which can manifest as delayed speech and foggy brain. My older child has an actual milk  allergy so I know it caused us some cognitive issues before we had her tested for food allergies. I also tried omega supplements in the form of fish oil but due to the messiness began giving him organic brown hen eggs(scrambled & purchased at grocery store) for breakfast and sprinkled ground  flax seeds in his applesauce to supplement omega 3s and 6s.
