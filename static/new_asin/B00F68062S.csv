8612638,5,B00F68062S,"We are so impressed with this first feature film from Bill Haley. Direction and acting are first rate, and the plot offers fun twists and surprises. Despite our very different tastes in movies, both my husband and I laughed all the way through. Clearly, this was written by a movie buff and has more than a few inside jokes for fellow cinema lovers. On Amazon, the DVDs appear to have sold out, but indie film fans will want to grab a copy for their collection if Steve Phoenix comes back in stock.",1391040000,2,498,4.423913043478261
