959266,5,6305029482,"i love BOTH versions of this film, but prefer this newer one.  it is by far more faithful to the book, including many scenes of hardy's the other version simply cut out to allow for time constraints.  both casts are  excellent, but, again, i found the newer version's cast just a TAD closer  to the book's intent.  this bathsheba and gabriel are both totally lovable  and pitiable in just the right places.  This fanny is absolutely  HEARTBREAKING!  boldwood and troy are perfect as well.  my only complaint  is the omission of the gargoyles in the scene where the grave is flooded.  if you must choose, get the newer one.  if you can afford both - get them  both!",963705600,9,664,4.516949152542373
959267,5,6305029482,"This film, and the tv version of Pride and Prejudice, are by far the greatest 19th century dramas I've ever seen. The cast here is masterful - Paloma as Bathsheba, and especially Nathaniel Parker, whose spoken and  unspoken expressiveness communicates such a depth of both patient and  steady loyalty, compassion, love and turbulent, repressed feeling and  desire; he is absolutely haunting! This is a film to watch again and again.  My only criticisms are that Boldwood is simply too old and unattractive for  us to fully believe in his appeal to young women, and that Nathaniel Parker  is simply too handsome to be the homely, rejected but kindhearted Gabriel  Oak of this very excellent novel. (And by the way, do read some wonderful  quotes from the highly recommended Hardy novel and view photos from the  movie at my Far from the Madding Crowd site - under the name BathshebaOak  Hardy at Readers Vine!)",945561600,10,909,4.882352941176471
959268,5,6305029482,"Before watching this Masterpiece Theater production (and subsequently ordered the video), I didn't know who Nathaniel Parker was.  He plays Gabriel Oak in this drama, and if he has not been particularly noticable in  earlier roles, he is riviting on screen in this one.  Part of his appeal,  of course, stems from the excellent characterization and plot ala Hardy.  Oak is the steadfast one, so clearly a man above all men in his deft and  natural hand at farming, his honor and steadfastness.  But he is the  silent, in-love-but-denying-it one through most of the story, and that  gives his character irresistable tragic appeal.  Meanwhile, Bathsheba, a  beautiful but rather naive and foolish girl, allows herself be manipulated  by several other men (nearly to her and everyone else's ruin) before  realizing that Oak is her destiny.  The casting is superb and the acting  wonderful.  The tension of Parker/Oak having to watch silently while  Bathesheba makes foolish mistake after foolish mistake, is good  storytelling, but Parker makes it magic by the desperation and hard-bought  restraint he portrays on his face in so many scenes.  I haven't been caught  up by a romance in years upon years, but this one I cannot get out of my  head.  I admit it, I'm completely enthralled.  I'm an old cynic, a tough  nut to crack, so hats off to the cast and screenplay writer.  I'm sure most  women would find this as 'swoony' as I do!",917136000,6,1431,4.854166666666667
959269,5,6305029482,A very faithful rendition of Thomas Hardy's book. The cast is terrific and are very believable in the roles.  Nathaniel Parker as the loyal and decent Gabriel Oak and Paloma Baeza as the headstrong and impetuous Bathsheba  bring simmering fire to their parts.

959339,5,6305029482,"This is my favorite version of this classic, including the 2015 film I just watched.  The script, as others have noted, is more faithful to the novel, as are the scenes described.  Nathaniel Parker is perfect as the faithful, steadfast Farmer Oak, although I wonder at his patience as he watches Bathsheba flounder through two ill-considered relationships.  Sergeant Troy is well cast, and Fanny Robbin is far better represented.  Mr. Boldwold is older in this version, and appears a little crazy, which he was.  The farmhands are much better cast and explored here - they were a big part of the Hardy novel and the music is delightful.  I plan to buy this, since my VHS version is rather obsolete.  Well worth your viewing time.",1439510400,4,729,4.784

There is a depth and understanding and glorious performance by Paloma Baeza and Nathaniel Parker that will make this the most outstanding version of Hardy's novel.

The acting is very good, the set design and photography is excellent, the pacing very good and the effects are very well done.

959387,4,6305029482,"We enjoyed this because we like Thomas Hardy.  (I know, sounds weird, since he can be so depressing, but he was an outstanding author.)  The scenery was beautiful, even though bleak at times, but this helped set the mood for the story.  A lot of thought was put into the costumes, the buildings and the interior settings.  While it was an enjoyable and thought provoking movie, the actors weren't the cr&egrave;me` de la cr&egrave;me` of British actors, with the possible exception of Nathaniel Parker.  They were good, but not great.  They all seemed to be 'holding back', acting somewhat restrained.  Perhaps this was the fault of the director.  He may have been  intending to create the necessary somber mood, but the actors lacked that essential 'intensity'.  Paloma Baeza was not the best choice for the lead female role.  She came across as so very ""Un-British"".  With all the talented British actresses who could have played a definitely British part, why on earth did the casting director choose her?  She came across as someone from another country who had been ""dropped"" into Great Britain and wasn't quite sure how to act.  Nathaniel Parker did a very good job.  He did put so much effort into his part.  I'm certain that it was a physically exhausting part because of all the action required of him.  This movie is recommended for the serious lover of Thomas Hardy.  It's not for someone looking for 'light, mindless entertainment'.  We do recommend it and are glad to have it in our collection.",1431043200,4,1507,4.81640625

The dirt, blood, sweat and work of a farm community told from the landowner's points of view and the people who worked there with romance mixed in.

Nathaniel (the farmer) did everything for her, and she treated him badly.  It's a shame he loved her so much that he waited for her to come to her senses.  I really wished he hadn't married her.  She also treated the old man badly.  That poor girl, who loved the soldier, and her baby dying was heart wrenching.  Never the less, I enjoyed the movie.",1403481600,4,468,4.32183908045977

Nathaniel's performance was outstanding and Johnathan Firth's Troy was spot on although I would have liked a younger actor in Nigel Terry's Boldwood role. I thought the director Nicholas Renton captured the 19th century era in magnificient fashion.

959487,4,6305029482,"This show kept my attention throughout.  I wasn't sure where the events were leading, but tension built as the plot progressed.

959488,4,6305029482,"I saw the Julie Christie version of this many years ago and was not impressed.  Like another reviewer posted, it was hard to get past the 1960 hairstyles and Hollywood drama of that film.  This version made in 1998 offers some good actors.  There is Paloma Baeza, who plays Bathsheba Everdene, a beautiful, proud, but fickle woman who inherits her uncle's farm.  Nathaniel Parker as Gabriel Oak, the man who loves her, is rebuffed and although he is a very capable shepherd and farmer, loses his livelihood.  Mr. Boldwood is played by Nigel Terry, and is the older neighbor, a life long bachelor who adores Bathsheba and is made a butt of a joke as she very coyly sends him a valentine.  Then there is the wayward soldier Frank Troy played by Jonathan Firth--a rogue indeed.

There is much more detail in this movie as it explores more the backgrounds of both Bathsheba and Gabriel as they meet early on and Gabriel tries to unsuccessfully win her.  It shows Gabriel struggling to run a farm and raise a flock of sheep only to have it all go to ruin.  Bathsheba living with her aunt suddenly becomes the mistress of the farm.

There is another character that becomes part of this story and it's Fanny Robin who is once the paramour of Frank Troy.  Their marriage doesn't take place due to a mix-up and Frank is so embarrassed that he just goes away.  What happens to Fanny is heartrendering.  The actress who plays her portrayed the simple, absent minded, innocent that she is.

The cinematography was excellent, with the cliffs, ocean views, and the 19th century life on a farm.  And of course the harshness of the winters in that part of England.  The movie is in two episodes and I would highly recommend it if you are a Thomas Hardy fan!",1378252800,3,1741,4.54983922829582
959489,5,6305029482,"For lovers of Thomas Hardy, this is the perfect realization of the book.  Who can get past Julie Christie's 60's hair and make up in the 60's movie version?

959490,4,6305029482,"I liked this movie.  It wasn't overly tragic.  At first I thought Bathsheba was going to be a brat but she wasn't.  She's a young woman who relishes her independence.  She rejects the proposal of a good guy, Gabriel, a shepherd and eventually inherits her uncle's successful farm.  She plays an immature joke on a wealthy farmer in her community that eventually leads to tragedy.  The only thing about this version of the movie is that the actors that portrayed Bathsheba and Gabriel did not have any chemistry between them.  The acting was good but the chemistry just wasn't there.",1376092800,,582,4.76

First, I've read the book and seen the Julie Christie / Terence Stamp movie.  I was a little wary of watching this version, thinking that it couldn't live up to the previous movie--it did.  In particular, I didn't know if anybody could play Sgt. Troy as well as Terence Stamp, but Jonathan Firth made the part his own.  I've seen him in at least three projects now, and I think he deserves so much more than being known as Colin Firth's brother.

I must admit I had a little trouble with some of the country accents.  I watch a lot of British movies and TV shows, and generally have no problem at all with accents, but some of these country accents of the farm workers and country folk were a little tough.  I didn't get every word, but I got enough.

The attention to detail was wonderful.  Watching the farm workers engaged in their various agricultural pursuits using antique machinery and old methods was fascinating.  The casting of the farm workers and household staff was perfect.  It is hard to believe these were modern day actors, not genuine country folks.

I suspect that Hardy would prefer this version, as it is closer to the book than the previous version.",1348876800,8,1430,4.488372093023256
959599,1,6305029482,"Having enjoyed many other period movies & series, but never having read this in book form, I was expecting something more. I do not like the story. The Woman's name  : Bathsheba is obviously accurate. Watch as every man but one makes a fool of himself....and roll your eyes as she acts stupidly until the end...and then there is no satisfaction, for she is not worthy of the guy...and my, what a sad happy ending...dismally depressing proposal. How could a man want a pariah like her ? Must be something in the water for she's not THAT good looking and she certainly is not that deep of a person. Pass on this and go back to the Cranford or Lark Rise to Candleford series, even a 2nd time around they are much superior and satisfying in every way",1348185600,8,746,4.405797101449275
959600,5,6305029482,"I saw this production of ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" when it originally aired and recorded it on VHS.  It was still ""Masterpiece Theatre"" then and was introduced by Russell Baker.  It has always been one of my favorites, and I was stunned to finally see a domestic DVD release after all this time.  (I have the Region 2 British DVD release, but the video quality is quite poor and I have to play it on a small window on my computer for it to look acceptable.)  This film is beautifully done with great performances, especially by Nathaniel Parker as the steadfast Gabriel Oak.  I've always had trouble buying Paloma Baeza as being so stunningly beautiful or irresistable that men would destroy themselves over her, but she is a good actress.

I consider his work, like much of the Bronte sisters, too ""dark"" for my tastes.  So, when I was gifted with this Masterpiece Classic some years ago it sat unwatched for a period.  The VHS  program presenter (name fails me) made clear early in his introduction that this story stands apart from Hardys later works, being one of his first efforts as a young man.
  The historical period is a favorite of mine, and the casting is perfect.  Coming from a peasant farming and backwoods poacher background, I feel very  much at home in the midst of these farm folk.
  The principal characters are also very well cast, but I was particularly pleased with Nathaniel Parkers performance as Gabriel 'Farmer' Oak.",1331424000,9,874,4.71523178807947
959604,5,6305029482,"This 1998 Granada TV-WGBH co-production of Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel of the same name - which was his first great literary success - is arguably the best tv adaptation of any of his works, in part becuz it runs for 200-odd minutes (not the 240 cited above), which allowed the production team to unfold the story in an ""unhurried"" fashion.  The plot revolves around a woman, wealthy farmowner  Bathsheba Everdene (portrayed by Paloma Baeza, who, though she looks much more southern European than English, is brilliant in the role), and her relations with three suitors, Shepherd  Oak (Nathaniel Parker), Sergeant Troy (Jonathan Firth), and Mr. Boldwood (Nigel Terry).  Interestingly, btw, despite her unsual position for that era as an independent woman of wealth, each of the aforementioned men is  drawn to Bathsheba for herself rather than for her money.

The adaptation is more or less faithful to the novel, which was set in the 1840s,  and both are favourites among Hardy fans largely becuz FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD is the least tragic of the Victorian writer's great ""Novels of Character"" (indeed, compared to THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE, TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES, & JUDE THE OBSCURE, FFTMC is a positively happy tale).  Another thing of note both in the novel and this TV movie is the way the farming scenes and the language, manners, and customs of the country folk are wonderfully presented, making the story as a whole seem true(r) to life.  And, as this is a Hardy story, there will be some incidents that may seem improbable, but the characters themselves are very believable - and very human.

Yet, while this is my fav Hardy adaptation and one of my fav Hardy novels, I still have to agree with the opinion of his great contemporary Henry James that, ""(the suitor who winds up finally winning Bathsheba's hand) is too good for her"".  Watch this excellent production to see whether or not you agree.  Enjoy.

959638,5,6305029482,"When I was a child, the beautiful Julie Christie played Bathsheba Everdale in the 1967 film version of John Schlesinger's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Far-from-the-Madding-Crowd/dp/B001B4VXWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Far from the Madding Crowd</a>.""  Ms Christie embodied a loveliness that is most representative of the mod Carnaby Street `bird' also epitomized by other long-tressed blondes like Pattie Boyd, Jane Asher, and Chrissie Shrimpton.  As the spectacular Bathsheba, understandably, Ms. Christie chooses at whim whichever man she desires--will it be the faithful Alan Bates, the dashing Trevor Howard or the wealthy mature Peter Finch?

In director Nicholas Renton's version of Hardy's classic tale, Bathsheba, played by Paloma Baeza, rules her country manor in a far less obvious way.  Ms Baeza's beauty when compared with Christie's does not entice with groomed perfection.  However, with her bold angel's face framed with a mass of unruly dark hair that she gathers in a quick bun or pulls back to suggest the haste of a working member of a busy farm, Baeza much more than Christie steps out of the pages of Hardy's novel with more authenticity.  Hardy's Bathsheba matter-of-factly marvels at the perfection of her face; there is little artifice--just knowledge of its existence and perhaps its ability to facilitate her ambition.  Baeza's skill in portraying these traits subtly speaks well of her ability as an actress.  Her eyes tell all; they well up with pent-up Victorian emotion even when the muscles in her face do not even move a millimeter.  Nonetheless, she may seem a bit reserved for the irrepressible Bathsheba.

Despite the tumultuous plot line, this version of ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" pleasantly drones like bees on a summer day.  The simple life of running a farm with its multitude of manual labors and laborers as suggested by the title, of course is debunked by the wild emotions and desires that run rampant below the surface of what seems to be a well-organized country manor. Each of the players, although they live in paradise, wildly seeks distraction, through love, the need for possession and the usual gossipy curiosity found in any close-knit environment where new faces instill a fresh surge in the pulse of the small community's lifeblood.

Most notable is the performance of Nathaniel Parker as Gabriel Oak--this handsome actor personifies the stalwartly farmer in all his varying moods--a far different role from his overtly sensual one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wide-Sargasso-Sea/dp/B0000D0YXV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wide Sargasso Sea</a>.  His love for Bathsheba shines like a beacon in the dark; his loyalty throbs steadily with a stubbornness at once chivalrous and proud.  He wears his honor like a badge and righteously displays his disapproval for Bathsheba's behavior.  Outwardly sensual in his resplendent yet subtle manliness, Parker's perspective frames the drama from beginning to end with a marvelous quietude that proves that still water does run deep.

The other two suitors of Bathsheba are admirably played by Nigel Terry as the besotted neighboring landowner, Mr. Boldwood, and Justin Firth, recognizable as the younger brother of Colin in the role as Sgt. Troy.  Renton's direction enables the audience to see Bathsheba from the perspective of the desires of both these male characters and to understand their motivations completely with respect to the sensibilities and expectations of the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

Bottom Line?  This BBC presentation of ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" faithfully depicts the situations and characterizations in Thomas Hardy's novel of the same name.  Beautiful to look at with lush countryside, authentic period costume and players that effectively portray the characters, this 203 minute presentation will entertain anyone who enjoys a Masterpiece Theater adaptation of classic literature.  Lead Paloma Baeza's Bathsheba adequately shows the vanity and expectation of her character with nuanced looks and smug reality befitting the farming community setting. Recommended.

959639,5,6305029482,"I just recently discovered Thomas Hardy, to my surprise and delight, having avoided him for years. I had never read his novels, knowing them to be mostly tragic and gloomy, and I had never had to read him in college (although I was an English major), until one day when I saw Under the Greenwood Tree*, and realized ""Hey, maybe he's not so depressing!"" I loved Greenwood Tree, and immediately bought both the DVD and book, but when I realized that it is considered one of Hardy's inferior novels (I don't know if I agree, however) I decided to take a look at his ""good"" novels as well. So I bought a mass volume of Tess/Jude/Native/Casterbrige/Madding Crowd, and have thus fallen in love with Hardy's writing and storytelling. I wanted more, and so I saw the recent BBC adaptation of Tess online, and then I wanted even more.
Which brings me to Far from the Madding Crowd. After reading a lot of reviews on both films, I decided that my first venture into Bathsheba and Gabriel's story needed to be with Paloma Baeza and Nathaniel Parker, rather than the 1967 Julie Christie version. I have yet to read the book in its entirety (I skip around a lot), but I was keen to get a feel for the story, and so I took my chances, having read that this version is the better of the two, and sat down to watch.
And boy was I ever not disappointed. It was brilliant, and moving, and I was glued to my computer screen (I was lucky to find it on youtube) for its whole three hours. From what I have read of the book I believe this is a great adaptation, and got the characters spot on, especially Nathaniel Parker as the ever faithful Gabriel Oak. I've seen Parker in other things, namely Bleak House and Stardust, and have been impressed with his performances, but it is as Oak that he really shines as an actor, and made me, in about a minute of knowing Gabriel, fall in love with Hardy's strong-silent shepherd. Baeza was also excellent as the willful Bathsheba and Jonathan Firth and Nigel Terry were both irratingly good as the rakish Troy and the disturbingly lecherous Boldwood, respectively. The rest of the cast also did a very good job, and I enjoyed every minute, and can honestly find no fault with this movie, as a movie in and of itself.
Having fallen in love with both this story and Gabriel Oak, I'm ready to sit down and read the whole book, and will possibly see the 1967 version to compare it for myself. I also urge any fan of Thomas Hardy to see this film, if you can, because the only travesty of this movie is that it doesn't exist on DVD for Region 1. WHY? What is that about? I'm sure that there are plenty movie fans out there like myself, that love classic novels and period films, and love this movie in particular; there's surely a big enough fanbase in America to release the DVD here. So come on! Somebody please, please, PLEASE, make this movie available in Region 1! We Hardy fans are waiting!
This movie is worth every single second, and if you can find it, see it! You won't regret it, and it's just pure punishment that I can't buy it on DVD!

*As an aside, Under the Greenwood Tree is scarily similar to this story on several points, and I honestly don't know why it isn't considered as good as Hardy's other novels. Give the movie a shot if you like this movie, then read the book if you like it. Dick and Fancy are definitely the first hints of Gabriel and Bathsheba, and the BBC movie is quite as good as this version of Madding Crowd.",1270425600,2,3461,4.374223602484472
959640,5,6305029482,"In the dramatic closing scenes of Far from the Madding Crowd, Gabriel Oak has decided to leave Casterbridge - and Bathsheba Everdene - for good.  Everything hangs in the balance, confounded by misunderstanding and miscommunications, just as they so often are in real life. Why wouldn't Everdene marry Gabriel?  ""Because you never asked"", she says.  I've gone over this scene several times, checking it against the beginning of the story where, after Bathsheba's aunt throws cold water on Gabriel's professed intention to ask Bathsheba to marry him by saying she already has at least a dozen suitors, Bathsheba finds out about the encounter and runs across the meadows to catch a retreating Gabriel. During that encounter Gabriel clearly asks Bathsheba to marry him. 'Sitting by the fire'.  There will you be and there will I be'.  So he does ask her to marry.  She, coyly, refuses.  She turns him down.  But he did ask, so the ending of the story is a bit confusing and the time has come to check the book to see if this was a production error. Gabriel did ask Bathsheba to marry him and she did say no.  Did she say it in order to be asked again, to be pressed, as is so often the way in real life?  As an aside, the delicate dance of 'no', 'perhaps', 'yes' woven through and played out in Hardy's story reminds me of how the feminist ""no means no"" rants have served to poison and seriously damage the superbly delicate and intricately complex, multi-dimensional relationship between men and women, where 'no' is a so very much more complicated a word than the one-dimensional, cut and dried 'no' that feminists would have us believe it is.",1269734400,3,1641,4.666666666666667

959669,5,6305029482,"A better dvd transfer for region 1 would be nice and so would a blu-ray transfer done with care.  I have a region free player so I bought this region 2 product.

I saw the much earlier production when it was released so long ago.  This is closer to the novel but leaves out a few words from the text that could have been included in the screenplay in my opinion.

""Vanity"" says Oak to the gatekeeper on the toll road after Bathsheba passes by on her way to visit her aunt.  This early part of the book is barely covered in the movie and is so needed for understanding.

It is her vanity that almost destroys her but causes terrible things to happen to others.  She cares so much for herself and so little for others and all the while tries to make matters look the opposite.  The film is subtle about her vanity while the book is not.  Her vanity meets the man of similiar vanity and she marrys him.  She soon learns her tragic mistake but is not much able to see it is her own fault.

But most of the others in the story can see it.  Over time they lose respect for her and some start to leave her farm.  Shepherd Oak is the only one who saves her farm many  times but grows weary of her selfish vanity eventually.  His life was saved by her when she lived with her aunt.  He believes he should help her in return.  The book makes more of this friendship.  Oak can not save her from herself.

Of course, the ending is nicely done and pleasing.

The music, acting, camera work, and local scenery of farming are done ever so well.  I really like this movie.  My wish for better is due to my fondness for the novel, of course, as it has a complex plot and marvelous characters.  In addition I was a farm boy in my youth and can easily see the difference between country folk and town folk.

I give it 5 stars.  A feature about the making of the film would be great.",1264032000,5,1863,4.1225626740947074
959670,4,6305029482,"The 1967 version of Far From The Madding Crowd will always be my favorite, but this 1998 Masterpiece Theatre two-parter is a very compelling presentation in its own right.  Beautifully photographed, capturing the rustic glory of the Dorset countryside and a very earthy portrayal of the novel's characters, I am very surprised that it has never been released on region 1 DVD.  Surely there is enough acclaim and fans of this film to issue it in North America, especially now that John Schlesinger's epic of Thomas Hardy's novel was recently released in region 1 and it received a vast restoration of sound and scope compared to the region 2 print.

I must give particular praise to Natasha Little's portrayal of the sweet and wronged Fanny Robin, cast aside by Jonathan Firth's rakish Sergant Troy for Paloma Baeza's Bathsheba Everdene.  You really feel for Fanny when she has been tricked into going to the wrong church on the morning that she and Troy were to be married.  The scenes of the girl's hardships while she is with child makes me wonder if that was some foreshadowing for Hardy's later creation of Tess Durbeyfield.  Baeza does a respectable turn as Bathsheba, and although she is very pretty I don't think she captured the striking beauty that Hardy's herione is described as possessing.  Still, she played the role well and she established wonderful chemistry with Nathaniel Parker's Gabriel Oak. Parker is excellent, capturing Oak's essence, but for some reason I found him too old for the part (although Alan Bates was surely around the same age when he portrayed the character, but then, Julie Christie was older than Baeza when she portrayed Bathsheba).  Nigel Terry as Boldwood more than matches Peter Finch's portrayal, while I don't find Firth as handsome as Terence Stamp, I feel Firth captured a bit more of Troy's rakishness and showed more dimension in the part. What I find frustrating about both film adaptations of FFTMC is that we never get to see Bathsheba and Oak kiss.
You know all along that Gabriel is the right man for Bathsheba, so you expect some kind of payoff (them getting married notwithstanding), but I guess it may be better to imagine rather than to be shown.

One thing I definately missed in this Masterpiece Theatre presentation is the wonderfully fitting music score that so defined the 1967 movie.  Not that the score for the 1998 FFTMC is not good, I just felt it was lacking something.  Oh well.  Either way this is still a memorable version of Hardy's novel and very much deserving of proper DVD distribution.  Please release it in region 1 DVD format!",1245801600,2,2605,4.84009009009009
959671,2,6305029482,"I watched this version of Far from the Madding Crowd in two segments. Part One was fairly well scripted. Any changes (such as Fanny deliberately running away from Frank) were minor and made sense. Even better, the relationship between Bathsheba and Gabriel was developed. However, well before the first tape was finished, I was waiting for it to end. The makers seemed to feel obligated to keep in every single incident in the book. In a novel, this isn't a problem, for you can just set down a book and come back to it when you're ready. With a movie, this is much harder. Filmmakers MUST realize they can make cuts in and shape a script!

Part Two was much worse. Without fixing the length problem of Part One, it almost seemed as if they fired the intelligent scriptwriter and hired one who didn't know what they were doing. Bathsheba appears to love Gabriel, not Frank, so why does she choose Frank over Gabriel after Gabriel has made a declaration of love? Why couldn't have Fanny just died on the spot when Frank finds her again and she confesses why she left him? What was the point of keeping her alive any longer? Not to mention having Frank yell at Bathsheba for no reason... The point, it seemed, was to have a sensational coffin scene with Fanny and a naked baby - and Bathsheba, as no proper Victorian woman would have done, asks Frank outright if he is the father. (The 1967 Far from the Madding Crowd gave Fanny a blue baby that looked like it was made out of papier-mache in the coffin scene - WHY must there always be sensationalism added to these old stories?) Also, in the novel, Frank never talks about firing Gabriel. He did in an original draft of the novel, but if Thomas Hardy could omit that, why couldn't the filmmakers?

Also, what on earth was the point of adding in all kinds of crude content in this version? This adaptation has two servants in suggestive positions in the barn, Frank attempts to seduce Bathsheba before their marriage, and the couple is later shown naked in bed (though their privates are covered). Such added content is appropriate in a story like Tess of the D'Urbervilles or Jude the Obscure, but why on earth should it be included in Far from the Madding Crowd? The '60s version was much more appropriate.

Finally, although the acting was good in this version (Mr. Boldwood behaved much more like a madman, and Gabriel is in it much more), I missed the charisma and star power of the actors in the 1967 film. Plus, Bathsheba, although fairly attractive, wasn't nearly beautiful enough. So this production was overlong, unengaging, had unnecessary bedroom content, and a confusing and convoluted second half. Stick with the '60s version. It has its faults, major and minor, but it's a much more enjoyable watch.",1232064000,8,2763,4.6462167689161555

959678,3,6305029482,"I should start out by saying that I love the book, and I have seen the 60s version of this story and rather liked it. That said, this is a nice little production. The scenery is beautiful, the costumes are great, the music is lovely and appropriate, the acting is solid.
The plot involves the lovely Bathsheba who is the object of affection (obsession?) for three very different men. Paloma Baeza is Bathsheba, she is a good actress but I found her extremely youthful face a bit distressing at times. She just looked too young to be such a tease. Still, she plays her role well.
The three men in her life are the stalwart shepherd Gabriel, the obsessive older farmer Boldwood and the dashing, heartbreaking Sgt. Troy. Nathaniel Parker (very good in Vanity Fair as Becky's clueless husband) plays Gabriel with perhaps more passion than he displayed in the book but he looks the part and anyone who has not read the book would never know the difference. He fits right in and looks quite handsome in the bargain.
Jonathan Firth (Fred in Middlemarch. Brother to Colin Firth of Pride and Prejudice) plays the thankless role of Troy with great relish. (Troy is not a cool villain, he is the sort you boo and hiss at whenever he is on screen, it takes a good actor to carry him off without seeming too Snideley Whiplash about it) He is the only man of the three who excites Bathsheba and he is the only one who is not truly in love with her.
The supporting cast is good, especially Natasha Little (Becky in Vanity Fair) as Troy's cast-off mistress Fanny.
In conclusion, I liked the 60s version a hair better but only a hair and I highly reccomend anyone interested in this story to try both versions as both are good in their own unique way. This version is more accurate with costumes and such but the 6os one is more suitable for family viewing.

7882016,4,6305029482,"I have seen 3 versions of this movie. I enjoyed this one best. Through out the movie this character, Mrs. Troy, shows more feeling for Mr. Oak than any of the other two. There was more details concerning the lives of the servents, also. They were more like a family, who really cared for their mistress. I hope everyone will give this movie a viewing.",1465430400,,351,4.415384615384616

7882018,5,6305029482,"This is my favorite version of Far From the Madding Crowd.  The characters and story-line seem more well developed, and my heart ached for Gabriel Oak, a humble, hard-working man crossed in life and in love.  The soundtrack makes the story moving, and the small vignettes of workers singing in the field drew me in so that I felt I was part of the story.  Personally, I don't think that Paloma Baeza is beautiful, but I know men often have a different idea of beauty, but I thought that she played the character expertly.  I could feel the energy of her defiance, independence and her folly.  I have been a fan of this MT version for years.  The DVD quality was excellent in my opinion.",1451001600,3,686,4.448
7882019,5,6305029482,"All three movies in this collection are perfect to watch on that wet, cold day when you are stuck indoors.  They are all classical tales, well scripted and cast.",1444521600,,161,4.551724137931035
