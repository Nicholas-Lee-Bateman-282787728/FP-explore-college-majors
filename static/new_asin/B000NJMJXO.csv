2771682,5,B000NJMJXO,"What cute characters and better yet a series that gives all glory to the only GOD WHO IS THE FATHER, THE SON & THE HOLY GHOST (Isaiah 7:14, 9:6 & 1 John 5:7)",1394409600,,157,3.787878787878788

2771685,5,B000NJMJXO,This video is very entertaining and instructive. After several viewings it still captures my two young girls attention. This is a great lesson in self-esteem.,1323216000,,158,5.36
2771686,4,B000NJMJXO,"IT IS A GOOD CARTOON BUT THE VOICES ARE ANNOYING, OF COURSE THE FELLOWS BEHIND THE CHARACTERS ARE OLD. IT'S A GOOD STORY FOR CHILDREN.",1284940800,,134,4.4
2771687,5,B000NJMJXO,"My child did a Hermie music program at his church school.  I was very impressed by the lessons and the program itself, so we have purchased several Hermie and Friends books and this video.  A great video for teaching about God's love and prayer to the younger age groups- I'd say age 3-7 would like it.  And parents will not worry about any of it.",1245024000,,347,4.3076923076923075
2771688,5,B000NJMJXO,"This is a really good video for children.  The animation is brightly colored and absolutely beautiful!!  The story is also very educational and based on the Biblical principle that God created all creatures and even though Hermie, the caterpillar, is just an oridnary caterpillar....God is not through with him yet...then later in the movie he turns into a beautiful butterfly.  This movie teaches children to accept themselves as who they are because that's the way God created them.  It also teaches them that God is in charge of what they are and who they become...you just have to have patience and faith.

The video is about 31 minutes long...my only complaint is that I wish it were longer.  The description at Amazon says 60 minutes long and the dvd itself says 40 minutes.  Apparently, those times includes the extras on the movie such as the making of the movie, games, etc.",1191024000,2,883,4.80794701986755
