8317639,5,6304467028,"""Loved Christy's enthusiasm. She's a great teacher. As a DJ, I need to know all these dances, even the stupid ones. It's always nice to look good doing it before you go out teaching it. Great idea to do a video so you can practice by yourself first. They should make one for the general public so they will look a little better on the dance floor!""",1085097600,4,348,4.208955223880597
