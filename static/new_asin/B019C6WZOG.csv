8744596,5,B019C6WZOG,"This DVD features six Chuggington episodes all full of train-filled fun. The episodes are all jam-packed with action and the characters teach such great lessons for kids. My kids have watched this show since it started and they still love it. We received the limited edition version of this DVD which comes with a toy train, such a great bonus! Overall though this is a great DVD and perfect to watch one episode at a time or a few.

There a few episodes in this DVD with an awesome stacktrain. For the price, you can't beat it! We all know the trains alone are around $4-8 each! Great price and item!",1456790400,,307,4.133333333333334
