Bass FishingThe Basics with Chuck Woolery is a really WONDERFUL DVD!

Growing up, I always enjoyed watching Chuck Woolery on many game shows and his Love Connection television show.  I even remember he and his wife on, Celebrity Bowling, in the mid-1970s.  So, when I saw that Chuck Woolery had a DVD on bass fishing, well, I just had to purchase it!  I WASNT DISAPPOINTED!

Chuck and his friend, professional, B.A.S.S. fisherman Michael OShea, do a terrific job at conveying their knowledge of rod and reel selection,  how to set it up, casting styles and techniques and  what equipment to be sure to have on your next fishing outing.  They also go into depth on color selection, explanation, description and DEMONSTRATIONS on top water baits, jerk baits, crank baits, spinner baits, jigs and worms.  Chuck does a great job at showing you how to tie the Palomar Knot which is used by over 85% of the fishing professionals on the tour.

Yes, there are things on this DVD that most fisherman already knowbut each time that I enjoy watching this DVD , I seem to learn something NEW!

BUTHERE IS MY FAVORITE THING about this DVD:  Clearly Chuck Woolery didn't do this for the money, you can tell this from his beautiful home and amazing swimming pool shown in this DVD.  He clearly did this Bass FishingThe Basics DVD because of his INTENSE love of bass fishing AND wanting to HELP those of us also learn to enjoy the art of bass fishing! I appreciate that!
Chuck Woolery couples his wonderful sense of humor with his smooth easy way of making things simple to understand, and does a MARVELOUS job of getting you just as EXCITED about bass fishing!!  He even makes a point about things to REMEMBER when fishing with youngsters as he and Michael OShea are shown fishing with their children.  Very nice!

I wish this DVD was 2-hours long!

(Chuck, if you ever read this review, please make additional DVDs about fishing!)

Thank you!

8051261,4,B0007TKGE4,"This DVD covers the subject of bass fishing very well, but there are a couple of omissions which should be corrected. The most glaring omission in my opinion was the subject of fishing line. No where on the DVD is this covered in regard to test of line or color or whatever. Also there is no coverage of the different species of bass. One assumes that largemouth black bass is the primary subject of the DVD however. A short section might have been devoted to where these lunkers hang out too. Despite these omissions the topic is covered very well and even the long term fisherman can glean a lot of material through viewing it.",1120953600,5,629,4.478260869565218
