8558307,5,B002S51K8Q,"This feature film is an homage to those old cabin-in-the-woods horror flicks that director Kevin Rhoades grew up on. A bloody masquerade unveils the murderous history associated with an upstate vacation cottage when two groups (guys vs. gals) are double-booked for the same getaway weekend. David Cooper as the creepy caretaker heads up a terrific cast of newcomers. An eerie, sexy, and scary slasher film.",1329004800,,406,5.2615384615384615

I'm a huge ""B horror movie"" fan and watched it at home with friends - we all LOVED it, funny where it should be, scary and well shot (plus the music is really cool) with a great story line!
