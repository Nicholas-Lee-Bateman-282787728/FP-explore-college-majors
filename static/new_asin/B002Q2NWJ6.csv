8487373,5,B002Q2NWJ6,This documentary is full of fun facts and interesting information about the start of what is now the trendy surf culture in Newport Beach. I grew up in Newport with many of the people who started the now popular surf companies and after seeing this movie I was so surprised to find how how much there was I still didn't know. There is some great and very funny bonus footage too and of course cool surf footage. It's a film you can watch over and over!,1308182400,,452,4.267441860465116
