660859,4,6303413269,"Devil Hunter Yohko starts out as the lighthearted tale of an average teenage girl.  Very rapidly we learn that she's not so average after all.  Namely, she's so desperate to lose her virginity she'll go to bed with the first cute guy willing to pay for a hotel room.  This is actually a pretty interesting situation of role-reversal.  If it were a boy who wanted sex so bad he'd sleep with any willing female, no one would think twice about it.  Since it's a girl, though, it seems strange and funny and sexy.
Of course, with a title like that you know there's more to it than the normal anime romantic hijinks.  Yohko finds out she can't have sex without putting the world in jeopardy from invading demons.  This sets up another role-reversal, when she must save a boy from a marauding female demon.
I couldn't honestly say whether a girl would like this anime or not.  I think most girls would like Yohko, but there is some gratuitous nudity.  Of course, most guys will like this.  The video is funny and the action is decent.  I recommend that you at least check out this first tape.",973987200,2,1086,4.461928934010152

660861,5,6303413269,"Devil Hunter Yohko is a classic that has a little bit of everything.  From romance, to adventure, to mystery, to action, to comedy DHY is an anime worthy of putting into your collection.  From fluid animation, to great  voice acting, to terriffic music this anime is sure to please.
This is  the start of the a great series as it follows the adventures of Yohko Mano  (the 108th Devil Hunter in the Mano line).  Story wise and charcter wise  it's very similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Here's a girl who simply  want's to be a teenage girl, but gets saddled with this very important task  of being a Devil Hunter.
Very highly recommended.  Oh, one last comment,  don't get the dub... the American voice actors are horrid.

1: Good animation, the graphics are decent compared to Fatal Fury or the Street Fighter series but still not AS great as Ninja Scroll.

Cons -
1: Not AS good animation as Ninja Scroll.
2: Only 3 episodes! I WANT MOREEEE!

660983,5,6303413269,"I've seen the whole series of Devil Hunter Yohko and I recommend it for demon killing gore/horror/comedy/etc. anime fans.  Technically they're are a total of 5 episodes because episode four is just mix of DHY music vids some don't even seem to fit in with Devil Hunter Yohko.  Eps. 1, 2, 3, 5, & 6 r all normal episodes.  This does have some Sailor moon feel to it but, it is still very different.  It is totally towards teens and adults and has alot of heavy adult themes.  Plus theres praticaly a good amount of nudity/sexual themes.  This is definatly not for kids! Its also a comedy/action/sex/gore/ genre of series.  Overall its about a chic who fights Devils/Demons and she's dieing to be able to fall in love and have sex with men! ...",1026518400,4,742,4.492537313432836
660984,4,6303413269,"Devil Hunter Yohko was one of the very first anime I saw way back when ADV was a little company that everyone never heard of.  It was and is one of my favorite anime series. It chronicles the story of Yohko, a young high school girl that has a special destiny.  She is actually the 108th generation of Devil Hunters...mystical warriors who fight the forces of darkness and evil.  While this may sound similar to Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Yohko came first. Yes, even before the movie. Perhaps Buffy was even influenced by Yohko, as Joss Whedon is a comic fan.
This release contains the first three episodes in Japanese as well as English.  Also included are some art, music video, and some commentary. I only watched the sub version. Perhaps the Amazon reviewer watched the show in English because obviously in the sub version his loopholes such as a devil hunter having to be a virgin are clearly explained after the end of the first episode, and we find out that the esteemed line of Devil Hunters must stay pure only until they actually become a Devil Hunter.  After that, all bets are off.
Watching this show now, nearly 10 years later, I'm surprised at how well it stacks up against today's shows.  While there is the typical gratuitous nudity, sexual situations, and violence present even in today's anime, Yohko is instantly likeable as she struggles with life trying to balance her secret demon hunting career and her hormones/high school life.  Sound familiar?  Laced with humor and gags, Yohko is a funny show.  Another great feature is the music.  I really like the music in Devil Hunter Yohko.  Perhaps it's just nostalgia creeping it's head up but, the music is quite catchy.
Granted, it can seem a bit much, and I agree that it is a fan service fest, as Yohko seems to lose much clothing, but there is still something about it that appeals to me. Not being into the gratuitous nudity and sex, I ordinarily would shun a show like this.  Like I said, it may be nostalgia rearing it's head, because I enjoyed this show and recommend it to fans of Buffy if only to what may have even been it's original inspiration.",1023235200,7,2124,4.604774535809018
660985,5,6303413269,"Long before Buffy Summers ever picked up a stake, Yohko Mano was swinging her soulsword and carving up demons and other assorted nasties. Devil Hunter Yohko was the first anime ever released by A.D.Films--now known as ADV Films--so it's only fitting that it should be released on its 10th anniversary to DVD. Not only is the original anime included, but also the second and third installments on the second DVD, and an impressive amount of extras, like music videos, an art gallery, and a historical commentary from some of the ADV staff. It should be noted, however, that DHY is loaded with gratuitious nudity and sexual situations, and is definitely NOT for children(although the content in the later episodes is toned down considerably).",1023062400,,740,5.024390243902439

660989,4,6303413269,Devil Hunter Yohko is a great anime series in my opion.  The anime has great battle action and fun comic releif in the story.  Yohko always is serious in one part of the story line and a total goofball in another part of the story.  The way Yohko and her friends have to deal with what's happening around gets to be the some of the best anime sences I have seen.  I am sure that once you watch Devil Hunter Yohko you will feel the same way I do about the series.,997660800,,462,3.989130434782609
660990,5,6303413269,"ive seen devil hunter yohko long long long time ago.  I don't know if the info is accurate but is is pretty accurate.  Yohko is a sixteen year old teenager that cant seem to get up early enough for school.  She finds out by her grandmother that she is to be a devil hunter generation 108. Her grandmother is generation 107.  why isn't yohko's mother the 108 generatiion? its because her mother had sex even though she wasn't supposed to for a devil hunter. being a devil hunter, you can have sex until later on.  Yohko's mother tells her that its alright to have sex with a guy and its perfectly okay to her. weird.  a guy that has a crush on her is turned into an evil person.  He takes her out to someplace and seduces her into having it.  this is not that r rated movies but it does have stuff you don't want young children to see. just as he is going to take yohko's virginity away, her grandmother comes to rescue her.  I also remeber another rival competing to have the title of devil hunter gen. 108. Her name is ayako i think.  she wears the same outfit as yohko but its black, i think that ayako's grandmother was a twin to yohko's grandmother but yohko's grandmother go the title and now she's teacher her daughter to take the title away for yohko.  Later on she meets a young girl who wants to be a devil hunter too and yohko is training her to be one.  There was one part where yohko is transported back into time where the devil hunter generation 1 was living. As she saw. the gen 1 was fighting a demon from escaping... thats all i remeber. only out on vhs, six volumes...",974592000,,1586,4.232558139534884

7848287,5,6303413269,"I have a fascination with anime series that focus on demon hunting (and they tend to be under the goth category) and Devil Hunter Yohko actually scared me as a child. Like ""Oh it's a magical girl series!"" -someone gets killed brutally- Whoops...

Devil Hunter Yohko is about a 16 year old girl named Yohko Mano who just wanted to get a date. Of course that has to wait since she was chosen to become the next in line for Devil Hunting. The series makes it clear in episode 1 she can have fun after she becomes a Devil Hunter but episode 5 seems to contradict that with her grandmother saying she still has to remain a virgin (of course this could just be for comedy purposes since that 5 minutes in the episode was about Yohko's family and Azuka constantly barging into Yohko's room whenever she was trying to make a move on the guy of the episode she crushes on).

There is a lot of action and sexual themes and its surprisingly how much this show got away with back in the day because now most harem series with sexual innuendoes get slapped 17+ even if its not as extreme as what goes on in Devil Hunter Yohko.

Episode 4 is the only one that is not an episode...just a music video mash up and that was the thing back in the day. Episode 1 is the most mature of the bunch and because of how extreme the episode was, they actually toned down the sexual themes afterward. Episode 2 introduces Yohko's partner and adds another plot hole in how anyone can become a Devil Hunter if they found the bracelet. Episode 3 and 6 to me was incredible weak and the latter is because of its plot holes (the identical twin, the lack of explaining the second Azuka etc.) while the former just seems more fantasy driven than demon hunting in the human world. Episode 5 for me was the best because it has the most action (and gore) of all the other episodes and probably had the most horror elements.

Overall I still hold this series highly on the list. Since the anime is cheap now, I recommend a watch at least once. The music is very catchy especially Touch My Heart and I love the artwork and how the action sequences are. (And Yohko was my idol when I was a kid except for the fact she pursued boys a lot). 90/100 with the loss of 10 points from plot holes. No one likes them not even me but since most of these episodes tend to be stand alone, it doesn't ruin from the experience. Should have been an episode based franchise instead of just small episodes that go beyond the 24 minutes.",1401321600,,2478,4.288461538461538

7848289,5,6303413269,"Even better than the first 3 episodes, Devil hunter Yohko is classic Anime at it's best! This show may be a bit dated, but it still has sexy girls, engaging plots, and great music. This DVD is absolutely exceptional in every way and I strongly recomend it for any anime fan(provided you can deal with the nudity of course).",1130457600,,323,4.491525423728813
7848290,5,6303413269,"The very first anime ever released by ADVision, this is still one of the best, even in this day and age of shows like AZUMANGA DIAOH, EXCELL SAGA, and MAGICAL SHOPPING ARCADE ABENOBASHI.

Regarding Amazon's plot description, there is no plot hole regarding the part about devil hunters and virginity. I guess that guy must not have been paying close enough attention. Let me make it clear for you: a girl born into the Mono family must remain a virgen until the first time she blossoms and becomes a devil hunter. If she loses her virginity BEFORE that happens, she loses the ability to become a devil hunter forever. If she loses her virginity AFTER she becomes a devil hunter for the first time, she no longer has anything to worry about (at least as far as her powers go). Because Yohko's granny didn't have sex until after she became a devil hunter, she got to keep her demon slaying powers for life. (This is made pretty clear in both the dub and sub versions of the show.)

As for other plotholes, Yohko and Chi's gawky male friend who is first seduced and then possesed by the principal disapears after the first episode and we're never told what happened to him. However, it's always possible his family could have moved to another town and taken him with him.

However, in episode 2 we meet Azusa, a girl who is perhaps slightly younger than Yohko who has a magic bracelet of her own and wants to become a devil hunter too and wants to learn from Yohko. While Azusa is certainly a cute character, and it's interesting watching Yohko fight with a partner, and the English voice actor, Kimberly Yates, does a great job in the role, it's problematic to the story. The first chapter gives you the impression that you actually have to be born into the Mono family to become a devil hunter, but apparently now any teenage chick with a magic bracelet can become one (at least as long as she's still a virgen.)

Then we come to the final episode, when Yohko meets her twin cousin, Ayako. We never meet Ayako's mom. Did SHE lose her virginity too early, too? (Boy, what would the odds of THAT be, huh?) Or was she killed in combat against a demon? We are never told. The biggest gap in the entire series, however, comes in the form of Ayako's partner, Azuka's twin, who is dubbed simply ""Azuka #2"". Did Azuka also have a twin we were never told about? Where did she get her magic bracelet? (How many of those things are there, anyway?) When Yohko asks the question of where Azuka's doppleganger came from, her grandma simply tells her, (and the audience,) ""Well, maybe it's just one of the 7 wonders of the world!"" Gee, thanks alot, guys.

Finally, regarding the dub, one other reviewer said it was horrid. Generally I try to respect everyone's opinion, but I have to take issues with this one here. I mean, cripes, just how good do the actors have to be to satisfy you?! I myself belive whole-heartedly that the English voice actors fit their characters perfectly, and I'd hate to hear anyone eles doing them. I became an instant fan of Amanda Winn's (English voice of Yohko,) the first time I saw this. Also, what ever happened to the person who did the voice of Yohko's vampy mother, or the young grandmother in episode 5 (which would actually be episode 4 if you don't count the music videos episode)? Both of them were wonderful also, but I don't think I've seen them in anything eles. If you're open to watching dubbed anime, I don't see how you could dislike this.

Anyway, this is a must-own for any true anime fan.",1120694400,10,3523,4.50547730829421
7848291,5,6303413269,"Yohko wants to become a 107 devil hunter but she has to stay a virgin first. Later in this show she starts to have powers fights a devil queen. She has a crush on a guy who doesn't want to waste his time on her. One girl she saves becomes her assistant. The action is not for kids, theirs a lot of panty shots showing and full nudity.",1120694400,,334,3.926470588235294
7848292,5,6303413269,"Devil Hunter Yohko is one SWEET show. I simply loved the first episode for all it's humor, wit, action, and sexual puns. The nudity in this show truly comes second to the story itself and all the comedy and action in it; the nudity only helps act like a guideline in a sense and helps moves the story along when needed. To be honest it makes sense to have it. I mean the story is about her fighting demons yes, but she's got to stay a virgin first until she officially becomes the 107 devil hunter. If you were a devil bent on world domination wouldn't you have your demon spawn change a dorky boy into a ""mega playboy"" and get him to sleep with her to save you the trouble of getting into a brawl which you'll probably lose.

Either way the show is super awesome. It has some great action scenes which are portrayed rather well with some artwork that goes beyond the comic book fashion. The jokes and antics are hilarious. I mean your grandma bustin' in on you when you're half awake and trying to beat the crap out of you isn't funny, then you need to see how they do it in yohko and you will. The artwork is is pretty good; it could be better I'll admit, but it's still quite good concerning what this shows about. Most of the characters along with Yohko are quite lovable, especially good ol' grandma. If you're a fan of anime genre or a newbie to it all then Yohko if definitely worth checking out if not owning.",1098835200,2,1417,4.2481481481481485
7848293,4,6303413269,"I disagree with the Amazon editorial review.  Devil Hunter Yohko, or in its original name, Mamoto Hunter Yohko, is anime that is anything but silly.  As a female anime fan, I found it empowering.  I don't feel the nudity is gratuitous.  Part of the story concerns Yohko coming to terms with her sexuality, and later claiming it, as well as the mantle of Demon Hunter.  We all make the choice (hopefully it is not forced on us) as when and how to engage in sexual activity for the first time.  When is the right time?  Who is the right person?  And what are the consequences of our choices?  These are all questions that young women deal with every day.  Yohko's choices and near-mistakes are as serious as the ones we make.
Philosopy aside, this is vastly entertaining.  The series has engaging characters whom most of us can recognize in our own lives.  I agree with the reviewer who said Yohko's grandmother is her favorite.  Yohko's devotion to her Obasan is touching.  Other great characters include Yohko's flaky but caring mother, Yohko's best friend, and a nerdy boy at school.
Overall, this DVD retains an innocent and noble quality despite a few blatantly sexual scenes.  It is noble because of the good versus evil story, and boy, this is some serious evil.  You will be on the edge of your seat cheering for Yohko.  This is an anime made with love, and one for the ages.",1080691200,3,1381,4.571428571428571
7848294,4,6303413269,"Most of the episodes in this series were humorous and entertaining, yet when you have a collection with many episodes, you would think each one would build on what the other showed which wasn't the case in Devil Hunter Yohko.  Each episode presented different stories and introduced random characters who were supposed to serve as main characters with a great say in how the episodes played out, but weren't able to do so since they weren't portrayed all throughout the series.  The humor in this series is specifically geared towards adults as it consists of an abundance of nudity and fowl language that most parents wouldn't find suitable for children.  Overall, there was a fair amount of action and gore in every episode, though I would be a little hesitant to list it in the horror genre.  Devil Hunter Yohko uses ideas of both Buffy: The Vampire Slayer and Sailor Moon to present its theme and purpose for Yohko being a devil hunter.  Also, this series does not consist of 6 episodes but rather 5.  The 4th episode is merely a music video collection about the series as a whole, yet the story still ends as it should and does not leave the viewer hanging.  The 2 DVD's as a whole consist of both dubbed and subtitled versions of all the episodes, a few music videos concerning the series, and a wide array of trailors in the separate disk by AVD Films.  The clarity of the picture is superb and very impressive.  In sum, if you're looking for a decent anime with interesting action scenes, an interesting plot, and loads of humor, then by all means check Devil Hunter Yohko out.",1072310400,4,1585,4.612099644128114

Devil Hunter Yohko is a story about a young girl who is destinted to become a devil hunter.  In this DVD set she comes into her powers, fights a demon queen, meets 2 totally hot guys, saves ones girlfriend, and gets an apprentice.  I wish there were more than two DVD sets.  This is one show that should have been continued.",1054771200,,616,4.559633027522936
