8343790,3,B001UI3OT0,"Sinhasan, the Throne was made in 1978 by Jabbar Patel was based on two novels by Arun Sadhu's novels Mumbai Dinank and Simhasan . I remember that this movie had made quite a few waves. It makes for a compulsory viewing because it gives us glimpses of the intricacies of politics and the back door deals that transpire. The action is based in Maharashtra and is from the perspective of a journalist played by Nilu Phule. The plot revolves around the defection of the number two person in the party played by Shreeram Lagu who aspires to be the chief minister and the handling of the threat by the incumbent Arun Sarnaik. It is extremely fast paced and has amazing dialogues and direction plus fabulous music. I was unable to understand the reason for it being shot in black and white but this does not hinder. The cast is a virtual who's who of Marathi cinema, stalwarts such as Dr. Shriram Lagu, Arun Sarnaik, Neelu Phule, Datta Bhat, Satish Dubhashi, Madhav Watve, Mohan Agashe, Nana Patekar, Rima Lagoo. Etc. Three stars 02/19/10",1266537600,,1031,4.670329670329671
