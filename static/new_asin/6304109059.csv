7861842,5,6304109059,Being a fan of the movie of the same name I was surprised to find there was a cartoon series so I bought it. The box was in somewhat rough shape but the tape played surprisingly well not even skipping so I was quite happy the show is cute as well. All and all I recommend it to fans of the movie and cartoon fans.,1426118400,,313,3.830769230769231
