8188876,5,B000P4VRDU,"A nice, older Italian comedy about a group of ghosts trying to prevent their old palace in Rome from being torn down to make way for a department store. The ghosts are of people from different periods. A young Marcello Mastroianni plays an 18th cent. Casanova type. A fun movie, dubbed in English.

8188877,4,B000P4VRDU,"Back in the day - let's say circa 1875 - those hard-livin', no-nonsense western pioneers would size up them newly arrived tenderfoots and then scoff mightily. But there are tenderfoots... and there are tenderfoots. 1948's much neglected THE DUDE GOES WEST is a rollicking western comedy and an Eddie Albert vehicle, and I jumped at the rare chance to see this underappreciated character actor featured in a starring role. Albert plays Daniel Bone (not Boone), a mild-mannered, educated gunsmith who in 1875 leaves Brooklyn to ply his trade in dangerous, disorderly Arsenic City, Nevada. This was once said of Arsenic City: ""In one week alone, they buried 57 quick-tempered gentlemen... from lead poisoning."" One thing you can say for Arsenic City: a gunsmith will always have work.

In the untamed West Daniel Bone runs into rascals and reprobates. He also catches a glimpse of Liza Crockett (Gale Storm), naive daughter of a murdered miner who's come to Arsenic City to claim her legacy. Liza has a map to her father's lost mother lode. This is no secret to any number of larcenous villains. The smitten Daniel Bone is very willing to help her file her claim, if only Liza would get over the notion that he himself is a shady character. Besides, what can a tenderfoot do anyway, burdened by soft livin' and useless book learnin'? Except that Daniel Bone is a gunsmith, and what good is a gunsmith if he can't shoot a lick? Bone's professional aptitude with firearms renders him well-equipped to cope with the hardened pistoleros who brace him in the West. It also helps that Bone keeps an innocuous pipe pistol on his person. And it turns out, his book learnin' comes in handy when he and Liza are captured by marauding Indians.

It's an enjoyable underdog story anchored by Eddie Albert's turn as the unassuming yet surprisingly steely protagonist. A solid supporting cast props him up: Binnie Barnes as the cold-hearted and calculating (and alliterative) Kiki Kelly, Gilbert Roland as the unsavory gunhand Pecos Kid, and Barton MacLane as the less unsavory Texas Jack ,a wanted outlaw who strikes up a tenuous friendship with our gunsmith. And because any western worth its salt must feature an ornery and grizzled sidekick (cackling is optional), James Gleason pops in as the requisite gold prospector. THE DUDE GOES WEST favors a light tone but never descends to caricature work. For fans of shoot-'em-ups, it even serves up moments of furious action. And if you can stand it, there's a hanging scene in which Eddie Albert drops the heavy hokum when he blisters an angry mob with a speech about the Fifth Amendment. And if you can stand it, Eddie Albert even sings a ballad or two. Roy Rogers doesn't have anything to worry about.",1349049600,2,3444,5.872255489021956
8188878,5,B000P4VRDU,"I just viewed this film, which I've never heard of before, on TCM.  I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could find a copy because I enjoyed it so much.  A very amusing script, competent cast, and though a predictable plot - it still had a couple of surprises.

I'm not a big fan of classic westerns, but this one has something for everyone.  It has all the stereo-types of bad guys (black hats), native americans (of the ""How"", and ""white man speak with forked tongue"" variety), but yet this charming film kept me watching to see what happens.  It's kind of a western drama/spoof/romance all rolled into one.  Eddie Albert does a great job as the ""dude"".  Gale Storm, while not the greatest actress, does an adequate job and is definitely easy on the eyes.

I thought it was going to be a rip-off of Bob Hope's ""Paleface""/""Son of Paleface"", but it's not.  Give it a try, I think you'll like it.",1326067200,3,899,4.4
8188879,5,B000P4VRDU,"A very entertaining movie somewhat like ""The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw"".  Albert was good but let`s hear it for Gale Storm too. Also, I think Warner Archives has a lot of gall asking the price they do for these movies put on inferior discs.  Besides most of the movies in their collection are second rate  in my opinion.  This movie was one of the exceptions.",1311811200,,358,4.461538461538462

8188881,4,B000P4VRDU,Eddie Albert stars in an early Green Acres-type comedy as New York gunsmith Daniel Bone who heads west to the wicked mining town of Arsenic to cash in on the market for gun repairs. On the way there he convinces the hostile Indians he is a great smoke god and the outlaws that he can outshoot them. Gale Storm enters the picture in search of her late father's gold mine and everyone in Arsenic wants her map. Albert is thwarted in all his romantic advances until he memorizes the map and rescues her to find the gold. Directed with flair by Kurt Neumann (The Fly),1229731200,2,563,4.371428571428571
8188882,5,B000P4VRDU,"Especially to those who know him primarily from ""Green Acres,"" Eddie Albert probably doesn't seem an especially heroic figure.  But in this BW outing, made when he was 42 (though he looks younger) and only 10 years from his film debut, he shows that he can do it, if not always in deadly serious style.  He plays Daniel Bone, a young gunsmith who, in 1876, decides that Brooklyn is no longer the place for a man in his trade and sets out for the mining camp of Arsenic City, Utah Territory.  On the train from Kansas City he meets Liza Crockett (Storm), who is on her way to the same destination in hopes of finding the golden lode discovered by her father before he was murdered.  What neither of them knows is that somebody else wants to find it too, and has sent the Pecos Kid (Roland) to do the job.  Daniel saves Liza's map (without knowing just what Pecos was after), and in the process makes an enemy.  He also manages, through a series of misunderstandings, to convince Liza that he too is out for the map--and perhaps her virtue as well!  Later he saves the life of Pecos's rival, Texas Jack Barton (MacLane), and when he and Liza are captured by Paiutes, manages to use the information gleaned from his extensive reading to gain their respect and friendship.  Gradually we learn the extent of the plot, which Daniel continues to foil, and in the end, ""with a little help from his friends,"" all comes out right: the villains are suitably dealt with, Liza's mine is saved, and (as narrator-Daniel tells his grandchildren), ""your Grandma...won your Grandpa.""  Though not notable for fast action and (as we might expect from its date) somewhat given to Political Incorrectness, this little-known comedy-Western gem offers good pace and several memorable characters, including Texas Jack (who comes to quite like Daniel) and prospector Sam Briggs (Gleason).  To me, its great strength is that Albert and his cohorts play it straight, even though the audience sees that it's a comedy.
