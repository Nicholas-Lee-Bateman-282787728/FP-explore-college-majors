3554121,4,B001EHDSP2,"We've been waiting for these for a long time.  Quality isn't the best but certainly acceptable.  Would have rated a 5 except for the fact that these are strangly enough recorded on DVD-R disks (you can tell by looking because they are a purple color on the recorded side instead of silver or gold).  For this reason, they wouldn't play on one of my older DVD players.  If I didn't know better, I'd think they were bootleg copies.  Don't know why they did this!  Otherwise, they're worth the wait.",1231632000,,496,4.51685393258427

I would gladly pay my hard earned money for titles like that.",1222819200,9,369,4.78125
3554126,5,B001EHDSP2,"This is an Amazon exclusive and won't be sold in stores. Amazon worked out a deal with nickelodeon to ""Burn on demand"" meaning upon receiving an order that Amazon will create the dvd and insert then ship it to the buyer...

For those of you who are definitely Doug fans, you can tell the difference in the show's animation.  That's because most to all of the animation was sent overseas to France's Ellipse Programme, but it shouldn't deter you from watching it.

Some of the memorable episodes are:
-Doug's Dinner Date
-Doug's Secret Admirer
-Doug vs. the Klotzoid Zombies
-Doug Lucky Hat (the music score's a definite must-listen)
-Doug's Lost Weekend
-Doug's Worst Nightmare
-Doug's Dental Disaster

I highly recommend this (along with Doug-Season 1).  Lord-willing, Nickelodeon and Amazon.com will finally release the final season soon.

A definite hit for fans and the whole family!",1232841600,,867,5.194244604316546
