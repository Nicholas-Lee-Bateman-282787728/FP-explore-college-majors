8757574,4,B01E38CBYC,Excellent series. The only reason I gave this show 4 stars and not 5 was that sometimes the English sub-titles could have been worded better. However this did not prevent me from understanding the story. Lots of interesting sub-plots and twists to the story. If they make season 2 I will definitely purchase it.,1485475200,2,311,4.777777777777778
