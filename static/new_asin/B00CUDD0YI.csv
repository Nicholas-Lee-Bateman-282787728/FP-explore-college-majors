5741860,1,B00CUDD0YI,"This is just a show ,, Or 3 assembled together to make a ""movie' ... O already had these on my dvr.. For free. LAME",1396137600,2,115,3.64
5741861,1,B00CUDD0YI,Care bears .... And a lot more villains and trash talk for little kids to pick up.  Seems aimed at a teenaged audience.,1391644800,,119,4.173913043478261
5741862,4,B00CUDD0YI,"While this is not the original Care Bears animated characters, it is still cute and adorable.  The characters are so colorfully animated that its hard not to smile at them.  I actually like that this was more of a movie than just separate episodes, but it is a short movie at just about an hour.  I guess though one hour is a good length for young kids, but my kids wanted more.  The Care Bears are all so friendly and polite, and they do show off some great lessons in this movie such as working together, friendship, problem solving and being honest.  All the lessons are pretty basic and easy for kids to follow.  This is the first ""new"" Care Bears movie we have and its a great addition to any child's collection.

I received this title to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1383782400,,793,4.390410958904109
5741863,4,B00CUDD0YI,Wonderheart Bear is really cute and funny in this movie! The only things we are not crazy about are that the movie feels like three tv episodes strung together and we prefer the shows without the human kids in them.,1380758400,2,215,4.4
5741864,5,B00CUDD0YI,"Full of fun and learn how to care, the little ones absolutely love it. It is an absolute favourite of my little girl.",1379462400,,117,4.130434782608695
5741865,5,B00CUDD0YI,"This was a great addition to the care bears movie line up! My daughter love the care bears and I remember the original care bears from the 1980's! While there were some new characters in this movie, the messages that are shared are ones that continually make me more than happy to have my kids watch this. On top of this the story itself was fun and engaging and you end up getting lost in the show itself and before you know it the movie is done! All-in-all this was a fun movie to share with my daughters and it is one that I would highly recommend to all!

5741872,2,B00CUDD0YI,I was good. I was expecting it to be an actual movie. It was just three episodes that played one right after the other. They made it seem like it was gonna be different,1425772800,,168,3.9705882352941178

5741874,1,B00CUDD0YI,"Waste of money.  My kids already own the complete season of this edition of Care Bears.  This isn't even a movie, it is just 3 episodes of the season put together.

8586512,3,B00CUDD0YI,"Not really an ""all new movie"" like they claim. It's really just all of the episodes pertaining to wonder heart in the TV series. It gets the job done with our 2 year old, but didn't quite accomplish having a different hour of carebears to hear on the background every morning",1473984000,,275,4.411764705882353
