8364892,3,B002D55NUC,"5-0 is the best cop show from its era.  I do plan to order the rest of the seasons because of that. Sadly, this season is all about ransom and espionage with or without foreign governments.  Give me just a plain old murder or two that has to be solved.  This is my argument with what transpired on NCIS.  Originally, it had a military person or spouse who was killed and the team went to work.  It evolved into all the terrorist storylines and has gotten old.",1494547200,,459,4.2298850574712645
8364893,5,B002D55NUC,"The discs and cover box arrived in good shape and on time.  As for the material, the show is intriguing.  The filming contains scenes that could only be from Hawaii and specifically the Honolulu area, which gives it a sense of realism.  They show a lot of gorgeous scenery, events from daily life, and sky and water effects.  The show starts out with short clips, of sights from around Honolulu, a girl doing a hula, and a group in an outrigger canoe.  The music is energetic and catchy.  On the Five-0 team there is a blend of the various ethnic groups present on the islands, working well together, which gives a sense of respect.  Some of the episodes could be from anywhere, but others could only be possible in Hawaii.  The plots are well thought out and portrayed, with good acting and sensitivity, not just a lot of fighting and special effects to get attention.",1393977600,,869,4.561290322580645
