7307002,4,B010CG2EQY,"Radicalized is a great film.  I loved learning about the various people involved in the movement, and also having the opportunity to delve into their lifestyles to a greater extent.  Seeing the arc of the rise and decline of a movement was brilliant.  I am still confused by the Occupy Movement (in a good way), but this film is definitely a must see.  The only thing that kept me from giving this film five stars is that I came away from the film actually feeling a little sympathy for the police.  Having a person yell into your face with a megaphone?  That's just obnoxious.",1442966400,4,577,4.5

7307004,5,B010CG2EQY,A solid journalistic style doc about the challenges of expressing the freedoms of speech and assembly among a excessively armed police presence.

7307007,2,B010CG2EQY,"It's a big missed opportunity.

We start with a compelling narrative of Occupy LA, and meet several interesting characters, brought together by OLA's violent breakup as they commune together in echo park to plan for change. and then....  something?

The film has little plot or structure. We don't learn nearly enough about the people, what makes them tick or even what their goals are. The filmmakers focus a little on about a dozen people when a closer focus ob 3-5 would have made a better story. The film just vaguely follows them from protest to protest (very well edited and scored protests) and cause to cause but theres no progression, no point to it all.  What change has happened? lessons learned?  I feel the characters and filmmakers had something to say but couldn't figure out how to say it so they just showed a bunch of protesting / partying for two hours. Theres a great story here somewhere, but it's not on screen.",1443052800,5,933,4.699386503067485

7307016,4,B010CG2EQY,"The best part about this movie is the fact that it is absolutely honest and raw. It's hard to believe otherwise. There is no short of violence and targeting, and Slovick's eye does NOT turn away. We watch a group pf people struggle against society; and some soar into themselves while others find their souls dampened over and over again by police repression. How would you react to cops taking you for the fifth time? Or come to your apartment seeking you out since you are a known protester? What is it like to live in a constant state of fear because all you want is the freedom and justice we claim to have? What happens when movements splinter and dissolve within?

Having seen this movie at a few festivals, it always brings out the old school hippies who say all movements need more peace and love. For all those sixties loving folks, there are scenes that show what happens to ""peaceful"" protesters in Los Angeles. Hint: It's getting beaten.

There are scenes in which you cringe, because there is no way in hell you'd be doing what they are. It's very real, and paints the people as people. There is no glory in their life, and their ideals are still being shaped. One gets the feeling there is probably eight documentaries in all the shot footage.  There is just so...much.

One of the best story lines is that of Shaimaa and Anthony. It is heartbreaking to see the constant targeting of them, and the hurt they endure. As they grow older through the film's timeline, Anthony is arrested many times in the span of a few months...all of them targeted. To watch the joy drain from their faces is devastating. Like lights being snuffed out. Shaimaa's words are a perfect choice for this film, and the poetry she shares will kick you right in the soul.

Watch it for a real unvarnished look at Occupy LA, and the beginning of many grassroots rebellions we're seeing now.

Oh, and FYI, recently the City of Los Angeles settled for 2.3 million dollars for excessive force and First Amendment violations at the Occupy LA Camp Raid.",1443052800,6,2034,4.574175824175824

7307025,4,B010CG2EQY,"I got to see this in one of its early fundraising runs for the local Pacifica station, KPFK. Its hard for me to imagine what it would be like to be someone who did not experience this documentary first hand, as I did. This documentary follows a group of young people on a journey through decolonization of the mind, and the quest to spread that to the world around them. While this movie gave me a lot of ""feels"" because of my personal experience, I felt some things were way out of time sequence or left unexplained, where it clearly need it to be. It left me wondering why so many important messages of the purposes, and directions of these actions were lost? The little bit of what you do see, can't come near close enough to telling the entire story, but I am sure time and legal reasons were part of the struggle of editing it.

I enjoyed the movie for what it was, it was shot well, it tells a good story, that I truly hope can make people realize that every person has the power to bring change to the world around them, even if its just a little bit at a time. I hope people watch this movie with friends, and discuss the themes and various situations presented in this documentary. This may be suitable for older teens of more radical parents as well. Its a long road building a culture of resistance.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Radicalized/dp/B010CG2EQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Radicalized</a>",1443052800,2,1454,4.816

The footage is raw and often times shocking. This proves just how powerful grass roots movements are.

7307077,5,B010CG2EQY,"This is an engaging and well done film that brings the viewer into the lives of a group of young activists facing a number of issues partly brought on by the gross differences in income and class disparities that our society is seeing today.  It has a fair amount of shock value, as it views life through a more extreme perspective.  Overall, an interesting film that highlights a number of issues that are current in our society, hopefully further opening up continued discussion surrounding these issues.",1443052800,2,506,4.872093023255814

7307097,5,B010CG2EQY,"Radicalized provokes a strong emotional response from the viewer. In our increasingly polarized world one can either despise the film's characters or praise them. I prefer to remain in the neutral space and not get pulled into the vitriol negativity of either side.

With Radicalized, we witness the purging of our diseased society. The angst and trauma that the marginalized population faces on a day to day basis, finally exploded in 2011. We can see this unfolding even today with #BLACKLIVESMATTER. This battle will not go away, until the problems brought up in this film are faced.

In the modern world, we're conditioned to get up everyday, go to school, go to work, and play the game. But when Occupy happened, many realized that our lives are a lot like Monopoly, where .01% of the players on Earth are consistently stealing money from the worthless paper money bank. Sooner or later, every player that is not part of the true global power structure will be bankrupt, because the game is rigged.

If you walk away from this film saying ""F the police!"" you've missed the point. If you see this film as ""a bunch of kids screaming that need to get a job,"" you've also missed the point. Attempt to watch this film with pure empathy, and love everyone in it. If you can muster enough energy to do that, you should come to the conclusion that our world is toxic and unsustainable. The ""pigs"" are just the attack dogs for the global cabal, and the ""incoherent young radicals"" are just a symptom of the system that is rigged to consolidate tax revenue to the upper echelons of power.

Human beings are a self-loathing species - perpetuated by our controllers. Rise above this by loving each and everyone of each other. Let's see if we can do things a different way.",1443052800,3,1765,4.665594855305466

They think a lady sat down on a bus, a bunch of people marched, some guy gave a speech and then it all just sort of happened. They forgot(or never knew) about the army of lobbyists, attorneys and back room dealers that knew what they needed to do in order to push legislation to a successful vote in congress.

They say that corporations are wrong and money is the problem while typing on their Apple laptops and ranting on their iPhones. That is the price we pay for living in a free country. You are able to wear, say, buy, go, and learn what you want. Within reason. Far from fascism. I love their youthful enthusiasm and passion.
