7368061,4,B013JZW8E8,"Turbo Kid is one part nostalgic love letter, one part creative ingenuity. If you grew up in the 80's or early 90's watching the classic sci-fi action films of the day there will be a lot for you to appreciate about Turbo Kid. The trio of filmmakers that wrote and directed this together really nailed the retro-ism that this movie took on while allowing itself to be comedic at times when necessary.

There are some great one liners in the film (like many of the action movies of those decades) as well as some wildly violent and extremely entertaining scenes. The movie takes place in a Mad Max-esque post apocalyptic future of 1997 (presumably a nod to the prophesied 'Judgement Day' from the Terminator series). The synth soaked soundtrack really ties this film all together, bringing some of those childhood memories back as if this was a movie you used to wear out on your VHS tape player (or laser disc) growing up.

You would expect a lower budget, straight to VOD movie like this to feel cheapened by the over use of un-refined CG, but the filmmakers stayed true to the roots of the movies they wanted to homage and many scenes were done with in camera make up and effects (always a great thing).

If you're like me and you just can't get enough of the 80's, watch this movie. These guys did a great job making something new feel old all the while maintaining their own originality without going so far over the top (such as something like Kung Fury) that there are parts of the movie you can actually take somewhat seriously.",1440979200,6,1534,4.550724637681159

7368063,5,B013JZW8E8,"This movie is so horribly done, I laughed until I almost cried. It is terrible on purpose, and hilariously entertaining because it does such an amazing  job of being awful. This plays homage to so many bad apocalyptic 80's movies. If you grew up in the 70's/80's, you will love it. If you are a little younger, this movie tells you what you missed out on. Warning: F-bombs done badly. Blood sprays everywhere. Lots of 80's synthesized music.  Rides taken from the old ""Rad"" movie set. And the hero is a comic book nerd. What else do you need??",1526601600,,543,4.474747474747475
7368064,3,B013JZW8E8,"When I heard about the premise and watched the trailer I was going out of my mind from how cool they sounded/looked. I thought for sure no matter what happened I would be blown away and would buy a copy of the DVD/Bluray when released, and my fingers would be on fire from how fast I`d be writing a five star review for what seemed like the coolest movie in the world. Well, after waiting all these years anxiously and finally being able to see it I can honestly say it was just mediocre.

 The Pros: Regardless of a low budget, it was extremely gory, charming and cute in moments, the acting was passable (The great Michael Ironside excluded as he`s always amazing), the premise was terrific and fun, the imagery suitable and convincing for an Out-There Post Apocalyptic film, and finally, a great soundtrack that took me by surprise. I kid you not; the soundtrack is probably the best thing in the movie as it goes from 80`s themed movie music to a great original synth score by the composer.

 The Cons: Seriously unbalanced/bad pacing, and tonally all over the place. The whole of the movie felt longer than it should have and the story has the viewers scratching their heads pointing out little plot holes as the events unfold. One of the biggest having to do with the ending and a certain ability Apple can do earlier on in the film. Also, the tones keep going from high to low so often you feel as though you`re on a roller coaster; lots of super highs one minute, only to have super lows the next. Doing this kills the progression of the story and any connection the audience has towards the movies` conclusion. Lastly, lackluster battles and a lackluster finish; TK rarely uses his blaster/glove except for taking three meaningless thugs out early on, and at the end when it`s time to really go crazy and let loose it`s done in a ho-hum kind of fashion. It all just fell flat for me when all was said and done.

 You can`t imagine how much I want to give Turbo Kid five stars, everything about it in premise should be amazing and bad ass; but I have to be honest and go with how I feel after having seen it and give it only three. I can`t say I`ll be digging in my wallet to fork over my cash in a frenzy of excitement to purchase a copy to add to my video library when it`s finally more readily pressed. It needed to be better and in execution it missed the mark. There`s supposed to be a sequel in the works so I`ll be keeping an eye out for that in the hopes they`re able to come back stronger in their next effort. Worth a look but don`t get your hopes up like I did.",1526342400,,2580,4.309278350515464

The weaving of an unashamedly childish story line with a level of blood, death, and gore that would make even the most hardened ""The Walking Dead"" fan feel squeamish exhibits a level of generationally privileged pychosis (amplified through a life long psychotic drug addiction) the likes of which the silver screen has rarely ever been graced with.

7368087,4,B013JZW8E8,Turbo Kid is one of those movies that will catch you by surprise. As you watch and get sucked into a retro 80s style post apocalyptic film with hauntingly mesmerizing music you get a sense of charm and heart not common in films as gratuitously violent as this one. The love of a boy and a new friend is heartwarming as they struggle to fight against Zeus who is awesomely played by a heartless Michael Ironside who loves to torture the people who live on his land that he claims he owns. Turbo Kid has a distinct feel and this is certainly one of my favorite recent movies of the last several years. It surely is a living comic book and you will just have to watch to find out just who this beautiful yet seemingly crazy girl Apple is who talks to dead people. You gotta see this and also own this. It is worth seeing more than once.,1493424000,2,833,4.2125

7368093,5,B013JZW8E8,"As a child growing up in the 80's, low budget post-apocalyptic films were a staple of weekend television and HBO. Some of them were trash, some were trashy, some were absolute jewels of action entertainment. A few even had heart, thought, and soul behind them.

For most people, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is the pinnacle of the genre, taking a modest budget and making something depthful, savage, and entertaining out of it. For a time, it spawned many imitators, it's own sequels, and became an iconic standard by which most of those followers would be measured... decades later, Turbo Kid emerges from the Wasteland to fight for a place among the champions of the Thunderdome... does it measure up?

Oh yes. Yes it does. Turbo Kid is both a clever skillful homage and laugh out loud send-up of the 80's post-apocalyptic madness. It's funny - occasionally hilarious - brutally gory (in an over-the-top Troma or Peter Jackson way), well acted, and surprisingly heartfelt. It has everything you could want in a 80's B-style post-apocalyptic adventure... and a Gnome Stick!!! It's main conceit (and one that some viewers may not be able to accept) is that much of the civilization and resulting action revolves around BMX bicycles as the primary mode of transport. No nitro engines, no rusted hulking desert vehicles or flamethrower guitars - bikes. Kid's bikes. Yes, it's both absurd and oddly sensible in a world long past the point of decay, but if you can accept that, the rest of the movie is pure wasteland wonder. The humor is pervasive, but often played straight, and is always respectful of the genre. This is not a wry, snarky mockery of  the genre and time period it's exploring. It's a love-letter - a blood soaked, flying buzz-saw, nuclear fallout, rainbow unicorn love-letter

Acting is solid from all the main players, including genre icon Michael Ironside playing the kind of role he's been playing since before the bombs fell and the world moved on. He's great. So is the rest of the cast including Laurence Leboeuf, as the lead female protagonist. Her presence in the film is one of the things that most entertains and elevates everything happening around her. Some of the acting is intentionally over the top, cheesy, or energetic - sometimes deadly serious and dramatic. It's well directed, with actors very well cast in their roles. Visuals are polished and consistent with the look and feel of the movies it honors. The wasteland is strewn with decaying signs of the apocalypse, but the cinematography is professional and often poignant. Audio is great and the synth music soundtrack is a complete triumph. Even if you don't feel or love the film, the music is worthy of any synth rock put out in the 80's, with a few emotional nods to Blade Runner's Vangelis score as well as many great action themes.

If you're looking for a post apocalyptic film that's fun, sometimes silly, sometimes wistful, surprisingly epic - and wears it's influences on it's spiked football padded shoulders proudly - you WILL enjoy Turbo Kid.",1485302400,8,3042,4.864864864864865

7368097,5,B013JZW8E8,I saw this movie on netflix and thought it deserved a written review so here it goes. The movie had an amazing amount of blood that I thought really made it look older than it is. I believe the blood wasn't  CGI either. The movie had a great storyline to it. The only thing I wish they explained a bit more was the robots. I thought the movie had a semi realistic idea going on where they were riding bikes instead of cars.

7368116,4,B013JZW8E8,"From the start, this movie is clearly an ultra-low budget flick that doesn't seem overly concerned with acting quality.  In fact, Michael Ironside (Extraterrestrial, Total Recall) gives perhaps his most ridiculously hammed up performance I've ever seen as some sort of evil tyrant in this post-apocalyptic Mad Max wasteland.  Not one second of this film takes itself seriously and thank God for that.  It's part 80s action B-movie and part 80s videogame in theme and score, embracing its lunacy and running with scissors at top speed.

The Kid (Munro Chambers; Godsend) is a quirky young scavenger scouring the wastelands for trinkets to entertain himself and goods to trade for survival resources.  He meets a bright-eyed, awkwardly idiosyncratic and perhaps mentally challenged girl named Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) who takes an instant liking to himwith a dash of stage-5 clinger craziness and equal parts adorable naivet.

This movie taught me a few things.  For example, duct taping a lawn gnome to a baseball bat creates a dangerous weapon called a gnomestick.  I also learned that the best way to settle a post-apocalyptic dispute is by arm-wrestling over hot toasters.  Oh, and be wary of evil robots!

The adventure takes hold when The Kid finds Turbo Rider dead and dons his armor and turbo blaster power glove, which hilariously turns its target into explosions of gooey mess.

Written and directed by newcomers Yoann-Karl Whissell, Anouk Whissell and Franois Simard, this film feels rather innocuous until the gore graces the screen.  Dismemberment accompanied by spewing red corn syrup and abundant gore-slathered chunky gushings beg us for forgiveness for the sinfully non-existent budget.  And you know what?  It works.  I like watching torsos get quartered, blood geyser eruptions and bicycle-drawn disembowelment.

The connections to Fury Road's (2015) water tyrant and Soylent Green (1973) were well-intended, but didn't fit my fancy nearly as much as the 80-90s videogame references to Zelda and the Nintendo PowerGlove.  And despite its utter nonsense--best characterized by liquefying people and low-speed BMX chases--I ""think"" I enjoyed this.  The combat violence was tedious at best (probably meant to be funny--but not so much for me), but I found it salvaged by the ridiculous gore.

I find myself questioning the genre of this movie.  It's ultra-gory nature has made it an instant favorite to horror gorehounds, but it's more of a campy action B-movie.  I guess it doesn't really matter, does it?  It's zany and bloody and funny, and that does it for me.  If you enjoy pure cinematic lunacy, then this is probably for you, too.  I will see that among movies like this, this is more on the forgettable side and I definitely have no desire to ever see it again.  But I might be interested to see what these filmmakers do next, preferably with a bigger budget.",1455494400,,2881,5.117773019271948

7368121,2,B013JZW8E8,"I'll never wrap my mind around the mouth watering that follows a few festival darlings like this. It's simply an amalgamation of forced references and tropes seeking to pay homage to an era and type of filmmaking that invented them organically.

As a result it has no real unique point of view, story, or theme but is simply a colorful husk meant to contain nostalgia. It leaves no lasting impression on its own merit other than that it's a hyper violent send up of bygone days. Why the level of violence is as high as it is, is also preposterous and nonsensical. I enjoy a good gore fest but it seems to be jackknifed into a premise that needn't call for it and would benefit greater by embracing its childlike influences rather than trying to create a juxtaposed version of what those influences would be like if they grew up.

Artistically it also never fully captures the look and feel of its 80's and early 90's influences. So evenly lit, so digital, and all taking place in the day time in locations that look less dystopian than present day Detroit.

Unfortunately it's simply another 21st century trope machine that borrows much from the greats but somehow manages to run ninety minutes without a life of its own all in the name of, ""Remember how cool this stuff was? It's still cool if you just hop in our little time machine! Oh, and also people are mutilated and there is tremendous bloodshed.""",1454716800,,1405,4.589641434262949

There are some great movies still being made today, but zombies, crime dramas, and the unreal/surreal horror films; enough is enough already.

7368140,5,B013JZW8E8,"Turbo Kid is stupid, has a lot of stuff that if you mistook this to be a plausible or realistic story line you could tear apart with example after example, starting with this is a post 1997 nuclear war aftermath world (homage to Judgement Day's nuclear war date perhaps), yet the main hero and everyone else dress and have items such as cassette tapes from the 80's. Why no one drives a car, guns aren't plentiful and good and bad guys go everywhere on BMX bikes is just something you're going to have to accept. This film has bright colours, fun fight scenes with limbs, heads and so forth sliced off easily, and tacky costumes. It's simply a lot of fun. You do probably have had to be exposed to childhood shows and movies, as well as cartoons set in this sort of world which weren't necessarily not trying to be realistic back in the day, but if you watched those you can appreciate what these film makers, script writers and actors are trying to achieve with Turbo Kid.

The basic plot revolves around a kid who survives by scavenging and trading what he finds for bottles of water (you don't want to know where the supply the water's coming from) and occasionally something else such as an old Turbo Kid comic. It is when he has stopped on his journey home to read this sitting on a park swing (possibly supposed to be the one from the nuclear blast scenes in Terminator 2), and a hot but weird girl surprises him and then quickly freaks him out by telling a corpse it's all right now she has found someone new to look after her so he flees. But there's no getting rid of her and when she's captured by the minions of a the wasteland's overlord, he's going to have to embrace his inner Turbo Kid and get her back.",1451347200,,1718,4.35202492211838

It caught my attention and looked pretty unique, plus Laurence Lebouef's character, Apple, really stood out to me. So, after Liz came home from work, we nestled in and ordered it up (through amazon).
I'll say this upfront. This movie can get pretty gory at times. Not like ""Saw"" gory but more like ""Kill Bill."" Hyper Stylized. Silly.
The story is pretty straight forward with a few enjoyable twists. It's something that teenage me could have dreamed up.
We ended up really enjoying the movie and I was right, Lebouef was outstanding.
The trailer makes the movie look much more action oriented than it really is, which is great in my opinion.

7368174,4,B013JZW8E8,"There are many ways to describe the unique world of Turbo Kid. It is a Mad Max-like post-apocalyptic world where civilization has collapsed; where tyrannical warlord Zeus (scene-stealing Michael Ironside) rules with an army of warriors riding BMXs (yes, bicycles, not motorcycles). And in this wasteland the Kid (Munro Chambers), a comic book reading, bicycle-riding boy, meets a mysterious girl named Apple (Laurence Leboeuf).

Turbo Kid is not just an ode to the 1980s and 90s; it works well as a piece of entertainment on its own, with ridiculously gory action scenes and delightfully eccentric characters. This is a well-worn story of heroism and boy meets girl, and the writer-director team (of Franois Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell) takes it very seriously.

The result is a low-budget movie with a high entertainment value, a fun movie for moviegoers, especially for those who like the pop culture of the 1980s and 90s, or things such as retro games and Giorgio Moroder synth music. And the heroine Apple is really charming.",1444176000,,1048,5.158823529411765

7368179,3,B013JZW8E8,"Another fake 1980's movie from Canada, this one spoofing the post-apocalyptic genre.  There's some funny gore but not much else.  Unfortunately, Turbo Kid looks nothing whatsoever like a real 1980's film--it was clearly shot on digital video which gives the movie a way too modern look lacking the grain and muddy colors a real exploitation film shot back then would have had.  The film's synth soundtrack also sounds a bit too bouncy and modern and lacks the warmth  of 1980's analog synthesizers, instead sounding like music that was composed using a computer.

The story concerns The Kid (Munro Chambers, making little impression) who scavenges and tries to avoid danger until he accidentally finds the suit of his favorite comic book hero, The Turbo Avenger, which gives him the confidence (and weapon--a laser powered glove) to take on the man who murdered his parents, the evil despot Zeus (Michael Ironside), who likes to kidnap innocent people, force them into gladiator style fights for the entertainment of his followers and then juice the dead bodies to create the world's most precious commodity--water.

I've always been a Michael Ironside fan, but he probably wasn't the best choice for this part--he looks old and worn out, lacking the intensity he used to bring to the screen.  A lack of energy also extends to the film's decision to have everyone ride around on bicycles, which probably seemed like a cute joke on paper but in practice slows down the action.  Real films of this type would have had the characters on motorcycles, even if the question of where the gasoline was coming from was completely ignored, which probably would have been a better idea here.  The novelty of watching Mad Max style characters ride around on bicycles might have worked in a short film, but in a feature the joke wears out pretty fast.

Of the rest of the cast, only Laurence Lebouf as The Kid's antic female best friend Apple manages to make much of an impression, bringing a comic energy to her scenes that is absent from the rest of the film.  The gore in the fight scenes is over-the-top and frequently amusing, but it's a shame that the same over-the-top sensibility wasn't applied to any other aspect of the movie--Turbo Kid lacks the energy and humor to make much of a mark as a comedy and is too obviously inauthentic in its look and style to work as a fake 1980's exploitation film.  Other than Apple and the gore Turbo Kid is a listless bore, watchable but not nearly as fun as the more authentic Hobo With A Shotgun or The House of the Devil, both of which could pass for actual 1980's films or the daffy Dude Bro Party Massacre III, which looked about as authentic as Turbo Kid but at least offered fairly consistent laughs.  Turbo Kid, on the other hand, is a decent time waster if you are really hard up for something to watch but nothing more.",1443744000,,2861,4.709418837675351

The world is interesting which most post-apocalyptic worlds are but it's the little things that separate it from the rest. For example, in this world people travel via bike exclusively which makes sense and ties into how well this movie pays homage to the 80's without centering the movie on it. Despite its desolate setting it is actually filled with vibrant colors as well as characters. The story isn't exactly anything brand new but the way its told is truly entertaining. The action scenes always have purpose never do you wonder what a character's motivation for fighting is. Along with the action comes plenty of gore which might bother some viewers but I feel as though its so over the top that its more comedic than anything. The music is made mostly of synths with the main theme being No tomorrow by Le Matos, a beautiful track that sums up everything Turbo Kid is about adventure, wonder and a hint of love. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end and plan on purchasing a physical copy if it becomes available. So if you have the urge to go biking through a wasteland with a mysterious pink haired girl this movie is definitely for you.",1443139200,,1566,4.698181818181818

7368197,4,B013JZW8E8,"A fun, 80''s style action/sci-fi romp through a late 90's apocalyptic wasteland. Heavy on nostalgia without relying on references to 80's pop-culture or gimicks. Story, heart, action, and some character development. A bit on the short side, and some elements didn't seem to make sense, especially near the end of the movie, but overall quite satisfying, especially for such a small production.",1443139200,,393,5.354838709677419
7368198,5,B013JZW8E8,Turbo Kid is one of the best post apocalyptic movies to come out.  Everything from the colors to the music screams 80s / early 90s nostalgia.

7368199,3,B013JZW8E8,"I love everything they did with the practical effects, location, props and background design, but I wasn't invested in any tension that was going on in the movie. I didn't know it was, but the major breaks in action and plot points didn't land for me. Visually and creatively, it was fantastic. I still recommend it, and I will be watching BMX Bandits again soon.",1443139200,,363,4.6
7368200,4,B013JZW8E8,"If you've seen every big movie from the 80s, you'll notice tons of loving references iconic scenes. That being said, this isn't just an 80s love-fest with no content of it's own (I'm looking at you Kung Fury). The story at the heart of this movie holds it's own, and I found myself genuinely caring for our main characters. The blood and gore are all very entertaining in that Troma-esque way, and the digital effects work very well in concert with them (which is a very good thing considering how many people are turned into meat pinatas via laser-blast).

Some of the acting from the incidental characters was a bit weak, but overall doesn't detract too much. Not a classic that you'll go back to again and again, but certainly well worth a watch.",1443139200,,749,4.58955223880597

I said heart because the movie is full of heart and charm and well crafted humor that is extremely rare. The characters are likable and the relationships are both heartbreaking and smile-inducing. The character and costume designs were very cool, authentic-feeling and well executed, the soundtrack and score fit and worked perfectly and the pacing was flawless.

Normally I'd say that this type of movie isn't for anybody because it is a bit quirky and far-fetched, but I think it'll charm anybody who gives it a shot.",1442534400,,716,4.774193548387097
7368208,5,B013JZW8E8,"5 Stars is maybe a bit strong for a nice action comedy, but for a film that came out of nowhere and I only discovered because the Red Letter Media guys got drunk and reviewed it next to The Visit, it feels like it gets the extra star.

Turbo Kid is an action-comedy take on 80s post-apocalypse films, with a very purposeful homage to early Peter Jackson gore.  The film walks the Zombieland line though, blending a nice comic send-up of the genre, while still also sincerely telling a story in it.  The story is straight-forward (and you can probably tell half of it from the cover pic ;) ) and keeps the stakes adequately balanced so by the end you're drawn in to what happens even though the climax is some of the most bizarre action-gore you'll have seen since, well, Dead Alive.  Michael Ironsides probably stands out the most, keeping a good balance of fun while never pushing his antagonist 'Zeus' into absurdity.

Overall, fun movie and I think if you generally like the three movies in the tag, you'll enjoy this.  It's 90 minutes, and gets you in and out with a fun but charming story as quick as it can.",1442361600,,1113,4.431372549019608

7368221,5,B013JZW8E8,"Finally a movie with a small budget that knows how to use it!
The story of Turbo Kid is packed full of nostalgia , i've seen someone describe it as ""Mad Max meets Mega Man"" and that's very accurate. While it does have a lot of elements from other movies of this genre, you never one feel bored, or feel like ""oh i've seen this before"", like most remakes/inspired by/ etc films. Everything feels fresh and it gives you the joy of finding your favorite toys at a yard sale.
The story is sweet, it has a nice little love story tucked in the layers of blood and stellar soundtrack by Le Matos (seriously, the soundtrack alone is worth the rental/buy price) .
The acting is wonderful, Apple (Laurence Leboeuf) has recently received an award for her performance, but my favorite, is Skeletron, his body language/character is amazing.
All in all it never hit a low moment or a boring moment, it peaked my interest the entire time. I really cannot say enough good things about this movie, however, if you don't like blood or nostalgia, then this movie is not for you.",1441929600,,1059,4.492227979274611

7368235,4,B013JZW8E8,"With its Laserdisc-inspired intro, synth-heavy score, and hair band soundtrack, everything about Turbo Kid screams retro. And that's before we really even get into the plot; a patchwork homage of '80s genre riffs, bursting with just as much heart as it bursts with gushes of fake blood. While retro cinema has long become an overexposed trend in itself, Turbo Kid is one of the best examples, working as a nostalgic love letter and a cheesy spin on Mad Max, making its timing pretty darn perfect.

Set in the distant future of 1997, the earth has been rendered an inhabitable wasteland, with water a rarity and what's left of humanity living in the Wasteland zone. That's where we find our hero, known only as The Kid (Munro Chambers), a BMX-riding scavenger trying to survive the brutal regime of Zeus (Michael Ironside), a warlord who controls the flow of water and commands an army of masked goons. Zeus gets his kicks by tossing his victims in a giant pit (really an empty pool) and having them fight to their deaths gladiator-style. The Kid has been on his own ever since his parents were brutally murdered, but he finds companionship upon encountering Apple (Laurence Leboueuf), a wild, pink-haired girl with a screw loose in more ways than one. Inspired by finding the suit of his favorite superhero, Turbo Man, The Kid, Apple, and an arm-wrestling drifter set out to put an end to Zeus' reign of terror.

With its campy gags, shoestring budget, and reluctant hero, Turbo Kid resembles all of those terrible post-apocalyptic wannabes from the '80s. What makes this film so much fun is that it isn't taking itself seriously at all. There's a lot of winking going on here that genre fans will recognize; everything from Army of Darkness (""This is my gnomestick!""), to Soylent Green, and of course, George Miller's Mad Max movies. The film was written and directed with obvious love for the time period by Anouk Whissell, Franois Simard, and Yoann-Karl Whissell, who created it originally as a short movie. It's easy to see how that would have been the case, and it shares more than a few stylistic similarities with Jason Eisener's violent B-movie, Hobo with a Shotgun, which makes sense considering Eisener exec-produces and has a small cameo.

While there aren't a lot of big names to be found, scoring a veteran like Michael Ironside, a staple of many a bad '80s action flick, was a tremendous coup. His enthusiasm only seems to skyrocket as the geysers of blood shoot into the air and the corny dialogue flows. He gets exactly how this kind of cornball film is supposed to be played, and undoubtedly he spread that wisdom to his younger co-stars as both Chambers and Leboueuf are terrific. As enjoyable as the performances and numerous sight gags are, there's still barely enough here to pad out the 90-minute runtime, which probably goes back to this being a short movie before it became a feature.

It's probably safe to say that Turbo Kid's goofy exterior and odd sense of humor won't be to everyone's liking, but this movie wasn't made for those people, anyway. There's an audience out there who will lovingly embrace Turbo Kid, and for them they'll look at it as a modern day cult classic.",1441584000,,3203,4.786618444846293

It was nice to see how character driven the plot was too; great acting too. These guys did a stellar job here.
