8532750,5,B008YT8RAY,A Great disc to buy with three movie on the same disc. Benji are great classic movies to own.,1447200000,,93,3.9473684210526314

8532752,1,B008YT8RAY,"This ""Triple Feature"" pack is a disappointment.  Only ""Benji: Off The Leash"" is in 1080p.  The other two movies are standard DVD quality even though all three are on one Blu-Ray disc.  Looking at the product details, it does say Multiple Formats but that is very easy to overlook.  The packaging leads you to believe all three of these movies are in HD.",1424390400,,353,4.555555555555555

8532754,2,B008YT8RAY,"These movies are probably the worst example of Blu-Ray that I have ever experienced.  The colors are bland, and the details are muddy...look more like something on VHS back in the '80's.  They are cute, nowadays hard-to-find, movies that deserve a real restoration.",1401753600,,265,5.1395348837209305
8532755,5,B008YT8RAY,Our 2 1/2 yo son would watch the 1st movie all day everyday if we would let him. The other two are not my favorite at all but for the price its well worth it.,1363910400,,158,3.5428571428571427
8532756,5,B008YT8RAY,I highly recommend this product for anyone who has young children.  The movies are filled with wonderful lessons of positive interaction with people and animals.  My grandchildren enjoy watching these over and over.,1360281600,,215,5.484848484848484
8532757,5,B008YT8RAY,Cute light hearted films. The price was right ($10 for 3 films) but the picture aspect ratio is almost a perfect square.  I guess that is 4:3.  This leaves black bars on both sides of the screen.,1357257600,3,195,4.243243243243243
