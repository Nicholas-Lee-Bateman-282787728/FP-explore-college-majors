Since I saw them and listened to them onPBS I was hooked, I have been looking around music stores but they are not available, now that I found,I ordered 2. I am very happy.

8205326,5,B000RK57WY,"I have never been a great admirer of opera until I saw this VHS. These three women are amazing with their rendition of classic arias. They are so clear in what they are singing that you can actually understand what they are saying (as long as you understand the language). It is too bad they do not have this program on DVD, but if anyone out there knows of any dvd releases, please feel free to let me know!!!!! For a relaxing time to just kick back, get this VHS or better yet get the CD and sit back and let the soothing sound of their voices take you away from everyday noises, LOL!!!!! GREAT CD AND VHS!!!!!",1183248000,2,612,4.194915254237288
