They become embroiled in a future war, then wind up in the time of  Giant Lizards (because that sure ain't no dinosaur).

1019127,2,6305417180,"Thankfully, I watched this as part of the prime membership. Otherwise, I wouldn't have watched this horrible 1968 romp. This movie features a mix-mash of ideas that just don't congeal. The technobabble dialogue is exceedingly long and nonsensical. Considering that Star Trek was on TV at the same time this movie was released and Star Trek was able to use technobabble to great effect, this movie just couldn't get the hang of it. Oh how the actors tried, but the words just seemed like alphabet soup coming out of their mouths.

This is a movie that could have easily been featured on Mystery Space Theater 3000 or possibly even Elvira. Yes, it's that bad. The problem is, it's so bad it's bad. Some movies are so bad, they're actually funny. This one is not even that. It's dry, overly long, slow, the camera shots are held far too long and inordinate amounts of time are spent on long gobbledygook technobabble scenes that don't actually move the plot ahead.

The ending decides to yank out a whole swath of earlier film footage and replay it with an echo effect on the audio. Yes, it's the same exact footage. Worse, the reason it's played is never explained. Then, the final two characters who are now firmly 'lost in time' inexplicably decide to spout some cringe worthy dialog trying and play it off as kind of adam-and-eve exploration thing.

Oh no no no. You should definitely avoid this one unless you are really really bored or you're hankering for a really bad 60s B-movie that feels like a 50s B-movie. The name of this film is only reason I gave it 2 stars.",1467417600,,1571,4.603571428571429

This review is from: Science Fiction 2: Journey to Center of Time (DVD)
""Journey to the Center of Time"" is almost universally panned as one of the 60's worst sci-fi efforts. And admittedly, some of the slick, bigger budget time travel movies are more thoroughly enjoyable. But, some interesting theoretical physics and engineering concepts (as they relate to time travel) eventually emerge, making this rather interesting B-cinema fare. :"" <<<<<",1462060800,7,726,5.433628318584071

To the movie I would give 3 stars, since the plot is entertaining, its premise does not require an overwhelming suspension of disbelief, the actors' performance is overall good and the special effects are ok (for the time the movie was made). That is from previous times when I have seen this film.

My beef is with the dvd I received from Amazon. It does not play in any of my two regular blu ray players or in my multi region blu ray player or my regular dvd player of my laptop. All of the four devices give a message that the dvd cannot be read. The dvd case looks and feels really chip. Looks and feel like a bootleg. Although I do not know if that is the case.

1019419,4,6305417180,"""Journey to the Center of Time"" is almost universally panned as one of the 60's worst sci-fi efforts. And admittedly, some of the slick, bigger budget time travel movies are more thoroughly enjoyable. But, some interesting theoretical physics and engineering concepts (as they relate to time travel) eventually emerge, making this rather interesting B-cinema fare.

Plot-wise, an industrial CEO (whose deceased father wholeheartedly funded time travel experimentation) threatens to pull the plug in favor of weapons R & D, unless substantial time travel can be demonstrated. So far, his trio of scientists can only look 24 hours into the past, but not visit. Desperate to save the project, the scientists decide to attempt lengthy time travel into not just the past but the future, resulting in a temporal roller coaster ride that spans 5,000 years A.D. to 1 million years B.C. !

For viewers who are familiar with theoretical physics, some key scientific themes emerge from ""Journey."" First, the script does allow for accurately explaining the theory of relativity (though it does require some chewing of scenery to accomplish). Tremendous energy transfers also occur to account for the warping (or bending) of  the space-time continuum: The detour, if you will, that the time machine takes from time to time on an otherwise near infinite road. This is consistent with many theories (from Einstein's to Haku's) about the structure of space-space. There is also a thrilling scene that illustrates the time travel causality loop theory: That is, oversimplified, where a temporal event repeats itself continually within separate instances of time. And, there is a scene that indirectly references the ""Many Worlds"" or parallel reality theory of time (advanced by such physicists as Hugh Everett and used by many of ""Journey's"" sci-fi contemporaries like ""Star Trek"" and ""The Outer Limits"").

As far as ""nuts and bolts"" technical accuracy, ""Journey's"" time machine is probably too small and unshielded for surviving the intense velocities necessary to achieve theoretical time travel. However, the machine uses an encased ruby, that is tracked by mission control laser guidance, as means of navigation. While seemingly just scripted deus ex machina, rubies are actually important means of focusing lasers for guidance and measurement because of their low loss of power [light] transfer between points. And quartz-housed ring lasers are the focal point (pardon the pun) of renown University of Connecticut physicist Dr. Ronald Mallet's time travel experiments.

The movie's major liability is lax character development, though the actors make what little they're given work well enough. Tough guy actor Scott Brady (THE CHINA SYNDROME) and Abraham Sofaer--who bears a resemblance to Henry Kissinger--offer the movie's best performances (as the overbearing CEO Stanton and fatherly Dr. Gordon respectively). Anthony Eisley is the strapping scientific hunk with Gigi Perreau an approximation of Raquel Welch (from FANTASTIC VOYAGE), thus giving ""Journey"" a cheap, but requisite, modicum of romance. And the characters populating the war-torn future are laser fodder; but, the actors playing them give it their best.

With better production values and marketing, ""Journey to the Center of Time"" could have attained a better degree of sci-fi cult status. Nevertheless, for armchair theoretical physicists and engineers and perhaps their professional counterparts, the nicely staged theories, paradoxes, and accurate  technology in ""Journey to the Center of Time"" might just make for a fun way to pass an idle Saturday or Sunday.",1436400000,13,3620,5.476702508960574

The boxcover to the old VHS I have of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF TIME features a blonde hero-type guy firing some kind of futuristic weapon, with a dinosaur roaring in the background.  OK, first of all there are no lasers or futuristic weapons in this 1967 film directed and written by David L. Hewlitt.  Well, none that look like the picture and that are wielded by any of our heroes anyway.  And no studly-looking he-man type guys like the one on this boxcover.  There is however a dinosaur or big lizard or something - though you only ever see the head of it.  All that should give you some idea that you're not going to be getting a top-quality product out of this film you've never heard of made the year before 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.

I'm not sure there's much point in my describing the plot, but what the heck.  A bunch of scientists are conducting time-travel experiments - they're trying to just look into the past - but their experiments might be in peril because the new owner of the company funding their work, Stanton (Scott Brady, the actor you're most likely to recognize though I wouldn't count on it) thinks they're wasting his money.  He's a stereotypical greedy capitalist y'know (guess what happens to him later on).  So they push all the dials up to 11, and while Stanton watches the ""time vault"" which looks a little like an undersea diving bell ends up jetting off into the future with the capitalist, the older scientist who heads the project (Abraham Sofaer who looks an awful lot like Henry Kissinger), the younger impulsive scientist (Anthony Eisley), and the female scientist (Gigi Perreau) who is there to scream and do things she's been told not to.

First they travel 5,000 years into the future.  How do we know it's the future?  There's a needle-like spaceship, or rather a very cheap model of one in their view screen.  Some humanoid (read: human but with pale faces and vaguely metallic clothes) meet them and tell them to warn the past about the war that will devastate the planet.  Then all the aliens get killed by the humans of the future in a scene that just shows a bunch of people running this way and that.  So our little team goes back to the past but overshoots the mark.  There are dinosaurs and volcanoes and stuff.  Henry Kissinger-looking guy falls into lava, and bad capitalist commits a sin of paradox trying to take the time machine back on his own (despite having no idea how it works) and also comes to his end.  The young couple get back, and something weird happens.  I won't spoil this for you in case you have even more tolerance for extremely wooden acting, sets and FX that make the original STAR TREK look like AVATAR, and 25x as much boring fake scientific dialogue as action.  In the end it's too boring to be so-bad-it's-good; you're better off watching something like ROBOT MONSTER or PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE for that, and there are dozens of SF films from this era that are better than this one.",1268006400,,3016,4.536044362292052

1019498,2,6305417180,"JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF TIME is one of those cheaply made science fiction films whose miniscule budgets are matched only by an equally miniscule plot, direction, scripting, and acting. In this clunker, Scott Brady is your typically beefy industrialist whose only connection to the advancement of science is the financial bottom line. His unwillingness to open the vaults of further funding forces his scientists, lamely played by Gigi Perreau and Anthony Eisley, to prematurely loop ahead to the future in a time machine.  Naturally, there is a mishap that lands then squarely in a nuclear war, whose own weirdly made up leaders (Lyle Waggonner and Pouppe Gamin) do little more than prance about for their few minutes of screen time.  Brady and his time travelling cohorts travel back to 1,000,000 BC where they meet dinosaurs.  Apparently, the script writers failed to indicate that the dinosaurs died out when a comet smacked into the earth 65 million years ago. At this point, whatever plot coherence there was dissolves into a misty mess of chintzy special effects whose only apparent purpose is to divert the viewer's attention from the T-Rex size plot holes. Further complicating matters is a series of potentially interesting temporal paradoxes that might have engaged the viewer had the script respected his intelligence to the point of incorporating them into a coherent plot.  By the final reel, the viewer is asked to accept yet again another dopey science fiction cop out ending of How We All Began. JTTCOT had the potential to be more than all hands concerned made it.

Then you need a time lab to go inside the vault - this should be a circular room filled with all sorts of dials and gizmos that serve no purpose whatsoever; make sure some of them are housed behind cardboard-like control panels. You must paint the walls of the lab the ugliest burnt orange color you can find - that's important. Now take your big old ruby (no, I don't even want to know where you got it), put it inside a birdcage, and rest it on a stand in the middle of the lab. Buy a camera and put a TV screen on the wall somewhere (black and white, not color) - this is for the benefit of the folks in the ""control room"" (an even cheaper version of the time lab set); they, naturally, can see whatever your camera shows no matter how many millennia you travel in time away from them. Next, find some scientists; one should look a tad like Henry Kissinger if you want to do this right, but any young man and woman off the street will do for his assistants. Make sure they refer to the space-time continuum, stabilizers, and other fancy words like that all the time. You won't actually need a burly, antisocial misanthrope reluctantly funding the project, but if you have one handy go ahead and throw him in there with the scientists just to shake things up a little bit. There you go. Turn a few knobs, count down from ten, and enjoy your travels back and forth in time.

I'm quite sure your own time travel experience will exceed that of the characters in this film.

This also serves the purpose of introducing a dinosaur into the film; as we all know, any time travel movie simply must have a dinosaur in it.

Journey to the Center of Time basically exists to be made fun of, but the thing that bothered me most about this exceedingly low-budget flick was the fact that the writer started making stuff up at the end.
