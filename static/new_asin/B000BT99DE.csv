2439998,5,B000BT99DE,"These actors have starred in other movies such as La Madrastra, Rubi, and Corazon and those were excellent movies too.

6/16/09: The best love story I've seen so far is ""La Otra"".",1221264000,4,179,4.59375
2439999,4,B000BT99DE,"This abridged novela, which is about 8 hours long, is a step in the right direction.  Although it is missing a few scenes that made the series noteworthy, it's a huge improvement over the DVDs of ABRAZAME MUY FUERTE and CORAZON SALVAJE.  If it were only two more hours long, I might have given it the fifth star.

Jorge Salinas' fans will not be disappointed; his performance is not hurt by this abridgement.  His character is still the tortured macho man who needs to put things right, only to have his life complicated by love for the daughter of his worst enemy. None of the leading players' performances are seriously shortchanged, although Cesar Evora's Atilio is missing a shade or two of complexity that make him more than a typical novela villain.  The filler scenes are gone, which makes for a more streamlined story, but there are a few scenes and flashbacks that would have made this a stronger presentation.

Although the Juan Gabriel song used for the title sequence is missing, the lush incidental music by Jorge Avendao is there.  Had this DVD not included the marvelous romantic theme, I would have felt very cheated.",1151884800,11,1133,4.75
2440078,2,B000BT99DE,Placed an order recieved 2 discs. The side 2 is repeated on both discs of 1 and 2 no ending... Placed another order thinking it was an error. Same thing.  So unhappy to what the ending is.  Actors are GREAT Movie was Awesome but no ending.... First time I am unhappy with my order. Will not purchase from This third party vendor company in the furture. Disks recieved with a heavy film on them doesnt come off and the disks skip.  Had to clean them to play them Both sets.,1394755200,,472,4.222222222222222
2440079,2,B000BT99DE,"I DID NOT GET TO FINISH WATCHING IT BECAUSE ONE OF THE DVD'S WAS THE SAME, AND I WAS NOT GOING TO PAY AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ONE",1394409600,,123,3.5925925925925926
2440080,5,B000BT99DE,A good telenovela. I really like this soap opera. It is intense with the secrets and revealing that happen. The scenery is also beautiful. Arribe. Ole.  Kudos to the seller.,1393977600,,173,4.766666666666667
2440081,1,B000BT99DE,"My two-disc, two-sided set is mislabeled AND so is the replacement set I just received. I now have FOUR copies of Disc 1, Side 2, but NO copy of the last disc (Disc 2, Side 2). Amazon has given me a credit, but I still don't know how the story ends. The disc SHOWS Disc 2, Side 2, but when I load it into my DVD player, the screen displays Disc 1, Side 2, which is what plays. This is very, very frustrating. As I said, the new set from Amazon is another disappointment because the manufacturer's blunder has NOT been fixed. I have returned both sets. I give up.",1375142400,3,562,4.118181818181818
2440082,5,B000BT99DE,"The Novela is great, The Resume is awesome. But, MY DVD CAME DEFECTIVE. Be careful with this soap. There are two double sided DVDs. But one of the sides repeated in both DVDs, now that's a human error. Im looking forward to buy a new one. Overall, it is a great thing to add to your collection.

It is a perfect thing to add to your collection. I just hope next DVDs don't come with the same mistake.",1372550400,,400,4.128205128205129
2440083,5,B000BT99DE,"I have watched this before on tv and couldn't wait to watch it AGAIN. I loved reexperiensing it, it was great !",1364515200,,111,4.090909090909091
2440084,1,B000BT99DE,I was cheated out my money bc its not the full novela...parts are cut out to were some episodes don't make sence and u have to put it together yourself...on top of the fact that its not even the original song from the novela either.....,1348876800,,236,4.266666666666667
2440085,3,B000BT99DE,"This telenovela represents folklore tale creation - a kind of a story that grandmothers would tell. It has some magic elements, but unfortunately it is reduced from original, so appearance of wild guy from the woods does not make much sence to me, I guess he was the one of the destroyed family members. I like to wach telenovelas for Spanish learning purpose, and it is also entertaining. So this telenovela is OK, but not spectacular. Probably more low budget than others I've seen. Actress who plays Mariana is lovely.",1310860800,2,521,4.8
2440086,3,B000BT99DE,"Compre esta Telenovela por el Elenco que tiene, sobre todo por Angelica Rivera, Cesar Evora y Jorge Salinas.
La Telenovela en si es Muy Buena, solo que la Actuacion Protagonica de Alejandra Barros al principio no me gusto mucho, me parecio muy sobre actuado, pero reconosco que es un pre-concepto, a medida que fueron transcurriendo los capitulos y se iban incrementando los personajes mejoro mi opinion al respecto y me fue gustando mas.
Angelica Rivera y Cesar Evora son Exelentes como Antagonicos y me gusto mucho sus Actuaciones, realmente se llevan la Novela ellos 2.
El Dvd esta bueno, los Resumenes contienen lo mejor de la Telenovela, pero podria haber sido mucho mejor, al igual que Abrazame Muy Fuerte y todas las Telenovelas de Salvador Mejia Alejandre, que se han editado en Dvd, no contiene la Msica Original, ni en la Entrada ni en ninguna de las Escenas.
La Cancion que pusieron en la Entrada no me gusto para nada, no se compara con el Tema de Juan Gabriel Yo Te Recuerdo, que era un Exelente Tema y le daba Emocion a la Historia.
En cuanto a la Edicion de las Escenas del Dvd estan bien, se entiende, pero faltan muchas escenas importantes de la Novela.
Hubieron 2 Escenas que no estan en el Dvd, y es cuando encierran a Atilio en la Carcel, no se ve cuando lo capturan en la casa y tampoco se ve como Lucrecia, la Madre de Ignacio se enferma. Despues, lo demas esta bien.
No Contiene los Creditos Finales despues del Fin, estan en un Extra, como todas las Telenovelas que duran mas de 500 Minutos o que estan mal resumidas.",1300233600,,1541,4.566787003610108
2440087,2,B000BT99DE,I did not like the version on DVD the Novela was poorly edited.  It was edited on a very boring way.  Lots of important details were left out as Mariana's second preganancy as well when Lucrecia had her accident.  Very Boring!!!,1260316800,2,228,4.512195121951219

so missed the end of the drama.

8092009,3,B000BT99DE,"I ordered this telenovela along with several others as a gift for my wife. She was disappointed to discover the second disk, side two was identical to disk one, side two; thus no conclusion to the story!  We returned the DEFECTIVE Mariana and ordered a second new set.  AGAIN the same problem.  The second Mariana was also DEFECTIVE. We are unhappy with Amazon quality control. I would rate Amazon product reliability marginal.",1394841600,,427,4.902777777777778
