2607590,5,B000GFKE4Q,"An incredible story of faith and survival. A must read for everyone. We keep saying never again to genocide and still these things happen. We must say the same to war, especially Bush's war of invasion on Iraq.",1198627200,2,210,4.552631578947368
2607591,4,B000GFKE4Q,"The DVD gives an introduction to our own darkness and blindness, as it reflects on the atrocities of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, seen through the eyes of the 19 yr old survivor. The DVD's 'brief' overview (38 min)allows viewers to get a 'taste' of not only the brutal history, but also the conversion from death to life, both physically and spiritually, in a way that does not overwhelm the viewer. The DVD really points out the intrinsic beauty of Rwanda in the midst of its ugly reality. I recommend this DVD followed by either the ""Left To Tell"" book or audiobook, by the same author.",1185235200,6,586,4.59047619047619
2607592,5,B000GFKE4Q,"I read the book Left to Tell (which was tremendous), and ordered this video right away when I saw that it was available.  It is excellent also, both as a companion piece to the book or on its own.  Immaculee's story is emotional and wrenching as it portrays an unbelievable tragedy.  Everyone should see it so they'd feel compelled to help others who are now suffering and dying in Darfur.",1181260800,4,389,4.5285714285714285
2607593,5,B000GFKE4Q,If you can watch this and keep your eyes dry you should examine your heart. A very touching experience as you relive her past.,1178409600,,126,4.291666666666667
2607594,5,B000GFKE4Q,This is an incredible story beautifully portrayed in this DVD. This is not to be missed!,1169337600,7,88,4.5625
2607595,2,B000GFKE4Q,"This CD was interesting and enhances her book ""Left to Tell"" by actually visiting Rwanda, her homeland.  However, I give it a low grade only because I was looking for more information on the spiritual elements of her heart-wrenching story. So by that measure, my expectations were not met. I can only say that the whole of her story -- the factual and spiritual -- as told in her book will live with me forever. Very powerful.",1167782400,22,426,4.532467532467533
2607596,5,B000GFKE4Q,This was a fabulous documentary...very moving.  It realistically depicted the atrocities and horrors yet was tastefully done.  It personalized a monumental disaster and put a face and individual story to the genocide.  This one woman's remembrance becomes a tribute to her strength and endurance and a lesson in humanity as she returns to her country so many years later.  You feel as if she is in the room telling the story directly to you...the method of film-making adds to the depth of her poise and emotion.  Highly recommended!!,1165190400,12,534,5.0227272727272725
2607597,5,B000GFKE4Q,"I purchased this CD set after seeing Immaculee on a TV program and just caught the tail end, and was interested in hearing more...when I started playing them with some friends of mine, who are African American, I am White.....(I only mention that distinction because white or black these tapes and this story is equally heartbreaking) anyway the story and what happened is spoken of in such and articulate manor by Ms. Immaculee that we couldn't help but listen to them all right through, they are long and harrowing...and I recommend them to everyone so as to know just what atrocities are going on, and how are lives are darn good by comparison..there is also a DVD to order and watch...I have it but have not watched yet..can't get everyone all back together....

Please don't pass this CD set up...you'll never be the same after listening.",1163030400,12,843,4.773972602739726
2607598,5,B000GFKE4Q,"Immacule's story captured my heart when I first heard her speak with Wayne Dyer last fall.  I read her book and felt transformed.  This movie adds another dimension to her amazing story, and I commend the filmmakers for such a clear and moving exposition of her experience.

The film has many great moments:  when Immacule goes back to the hollow shell of what was once her family's home, we can feel how overwhelming and sad it is.  She calls to her young son to hold him--one of the few blood relatives she has left.

Yet Immacule clearly has healed and moved on from the tragic circumstances of the genocide--and if this woman can forgive her family's killers, anyone can.

My favorite moment in the movie is when she talks about meeting one of these killers.  ""I'm so sorry"" he says.

""Yes, I'm past all that, I forgive you.""  (And I believe her!)  She goes on to say, ""But what were you thinking?  You used to be a human being!  How could you do such a thing?""

Now, what I love about this, is that she clearly ""loves the sinner, hates the sin""--Her forgiveness is not blind, it acknowlegdes that something happened that was not good, but she doesn't condemn the person who did it.  How utterly incredible.  It was as if she was asking him why he stole a car or something.

(PS his answer was that they told him they would make him rich, but in fact, he spent 11 years in jail and had lost everything once he got out.)

Anyway, I think Immacule is amazing, incredible, inspiring, beautiful inside and out, and I'm so glad to have this film as another tribute to her incredible story.

I was there, actually, when they were shooting it!  After hearing her speak the first time, I knew I wanted to do an acting project about her story.  I went to another conference and got to meet her. (Wow!)  When I learned that she would be going back to Rwanda to film this documentary, I invited myself along--I'm grateful the filmmakers let me stay!

Anyway, I love what they did with the material, and I'm inspired by this film.  I highly recommend it, and I wish it every success.",1157846400,55,2075,4.428571428571429
2607599,5,B000GFKE4Q,"The film chronicles Rwandan genocide survivor Immaculee Ilibagiza as she returns to the scene of one of history's most horrific displays of inhumanity.  The film is very well-done, taking the audience through the aftermath of incomprehensible brutality. Readers of Ms. Ilibagiza's book will be fascinated to see the bathroom where she and seven other women hid, to hear the interview with the Pastor who gave them shelter and to meet many other key figures in her book Left to Tell.  I think the documentary is particulary impressive in that the director could easily have chosen to sensationalize this material, and instead presents the story in a straightforward manner. Very, very well done.",1153612800,30,694,5.1875
8131402,5,B000GFKE4Q,Wow! What a story!!,1412035200,,19,4.0
8131403,5,B000GFKE4Q,I'm thinking of recommending her for sainthood. She has changed my life.,1405555200,,72,5.083333333333333
8131404,3,B000GFKE4Q,"This was okay if it's viewed as a companion to the ""Left to Tell"" book.  My recommendation would be to read the book first (which is absolutely phenomenal by the way) then watch this.  It's a short documentary with interviews with the author and images of some of the places in the book.  That was okay for me because I've read the book but even so I was hoping for a little more.",1393286400,,380,4.178082191780822
8131405,5,B000GFKE4Q,"While reading this book, I could feel Immaculee's pain. This book was so touching. It made me want to meet Immaculee in person. I felt so bad as she lost her family to the Rwanda genocide. This was an awful tragedy that I will never forget.

Very good read.",1353888000,,257,4.244897959183674
8131406,5,B000GFKE4Q,Immaculee gave a talk at a Catholic Convention in Indianapolis during July 2012.  I got to meet her briefly after the talk.  This story is well worth knowing and owning.  It is truly a Christian witness for all seasons.,1343001600,2,219,4.564102564102564
8131407,5,B000GFKE4Q,"The Diary of Immaculee brings to life the book Left To Tell. We go back and visit her home country, we walk the same paths, we go back to the small bathroom where she hid for those long months. We hear the sorrow in her voice as she walks us through her former life in Rwanda, and we cry with her. The sad situation could not have been written better. This book is another one to keep and reread.",1238889600,2,396,4.025316455696203
8131408,5,B000GFKE4Q,"An amazingly honest, touching true story that left me with thinking and knowing more about Rwanda and its people. It digs even deeper into the Rwanda issue that the movie ""HOTEL RWANDA"" as it deals with an invidiual and her struggle in this horrible war alone.",1224288000,3,260,4.673913043478261
8131409,4,B000GFKE4Q,"This is a very brief overview of Immaculee's incredible, horrible and hope filled witness to the hate we human beings are capable of, AND the depths of LOVE that God invites each one of to know in the midst of humanly impossible situations.  Her book is profound.  It should be read by every person on this planet. For those of us who do read it, what a gift it would be to find ourselves in it; in both the possiblity of such hatred that can take hold of our own hearts, and in the ""bathroom"" with Immaculee--being personally loved and ministered to by God Himself.  This movie is a short version, and very good.  It is a good starting place if someone is not a ""reader.""  My hope is that those who watch this will read her LEFT TO TELL.  Hatred is color-blind, nationality-blind, sex-blind, and unfortunately, often religion-blind.  We all need to beg for the Life of Christ to dwell richly in us and reform our sinfulness.
If every High School showed this, maybe some hearts would change early in life.  Immaculee had the gift of a loving, faith-filled family.  She has been chosen for a great purpose in this life.  May we hear her.",1222128000,2,1136,4.470873786407767
8131410,4,B000GFKE4Q,"Short and sweet, this DVD is well worth watching.
Immaculee give a human face as a suvivor of one of the worst tragedies in human history since the Nazi's impurged the Holocaust on the Jews.
Most of us at the time only saw images of machetes and bodies everywhere, and hence could not fully understand the impact on real people in Africa, who were butchered purely for being from a ""different ethnic tribe"".
Could have been a little longer however, and more reference made to the book that she wrote as well.

8131411,4,B000GFKE4Q,"Our bookclub read ""Left to Tell"", which was a wonderful book and resulted in lively discussion.  The DVD ""Imaculee's Diary"" was perfect for after book discussion to actually see the place where she was kept and see some of the individuals referenced in the book.  I would definately recommend getting both.  Was pretty graphic at times with historical footage, and a little sad at times.",1207353600,7,387,4.923076923076923
