4253768,5,B0043988HG,"I have been a loyal fan of Dragon Ball Z since I was younger and watching the original run on Toonami and on VHS.  I drifted away from DBZ for many years but have been an anime enthusiast ever since DBZ got me hooked.

Dragon Ball Z Kai caught my eye for several reasons:  mainly being remastered yet retaining the original 4:3 aspect ratio (unlike the previous two versions that chopped part of the format to be presented in pseudo widescreen).  I have faithfully purchased the Kai series (the titles released so far) on Blu-Ray.  Here are my thoughts:

Part three takes us through the middle of the Namek/Freiza saga.  Spoiler free: These episodes cover the time from the post Zarbon Vegeta battle and Gohan's pinching of a certain item up to  the second transformation of Freiza (episdoes 27 to 39).  For those familiar with the series, this is when things really start heating up.  For those unfamiliar, let's just say things start getting pretty crazy at this point.

Technical stuff:
The ratio is kept to the original 4:3 aspect.  Some animations have been cleaned and even re-animated (in the case of some of the lighting effects from ki attacks and power-ups).  Some of the re-animated shots look like something from American Saturday morning cartoons rather than anime, but these instances were very rare.  The two that stood out were in the previous volume anyway.

The sound is vastly superior to the previous versions.  The English dub is improved and they aren't afraid to get a little dirty (they swear often, but not in an offensive way.  They just yell 'you bastard' a lot).  Though the few uses of swearing is in line with the more literal translation.  Also, the American voice acting is a lot better this time through.  Most of the lines have been slightly changed to stick closer to the actual translation.  The Japanese voice acting is the original (highly amusing in some roles) though it has also been cleaned up a bit so that static is removed.

The music is the original Japanese score, just re-digitized for this release.  It is superior to the original Japanese and the American scores (though the American score was pretty good considering).

Editing:
Here is where most die hard Dragon Ball Z fans choke up:  There is a lot of cut content.  I have seen the original, un-cut, American and Japanese versions.  I gotta tell you.  You're not missing anything.  Most of what was cut was pure filler by TOEI trying to fill time slots.  They've also removed a lot of re-used cells.  I remember how annoyed I was to see Piccolo battling the Android and TOEI reusing animation cells from the Piccolo-Raditz battle.  Seriously.  Also, I don't hear too many people upset about missing out on the Garlic Jr saga.

They cut about 50 episodes (give or take) and reduced the amount to 98 (through the Cell Games saga).  I don't know if they will continue through the Buu saga (no word yet even in Japan), but I am a huge fan on the improvement in quality of picture and sound so I hope they do.

Also of note:  the Blu-Ray version is presented in full HD, though the original show was analog and standard definition.  There is a noticeable difference between the DVD and Blu-Ray version in animation clarity and quality.  There is also a major difference on the sound.  The difference is worth the $2 or so for the Blu-Ray vs DVD if you have a player.",1309910400,,3365,4.63728813559322
4253769,5,B0043988HG,"Please note, that what I am about to say in this review is strictly my opinion, if you disagree, that's fine, you can comment below with your opinion, and we could discuss it. Now, on to the review:

Now, this is just my opinion, but when I saw the original Dragon Ball Z, I absolutely just couldn't STAND the Namek saga(excluding Freeza). It was so slow, and drawn out due to all the filler. WAY too many random Bulma moments if you asked me.

But thank Kami for Dragon Ball(Z)Kai! Now, the Namek saga's is one of my favorites, because I can now ENJOY the saga, instead of constantly going back to whatever Roshi's doing on Earth at that certain time, or what kind of trouble Bulma's getting into.",1309737600,3,698,4.403100775193798
4253770,4,B0043988HG,"As Vegeta battles with Krillin and Gohan for control of the Dragon Balls an unforseen circumstance forces them to team up or die!

Quick recap for those who don't know about Kai: DBK is the 20th aniversary version of DBZ. That annoying filler that would make entire story arcs last forever and lead to the nickname Drag-on Ball Z? Totally gone and replaced with a remastered version that has a much quicker pace. This pace favors those that could never get into the original DBZ anime due to it's length as well as manga purists that don't care for anything filler. Animation is improved and cleaned up all around with the occasional new clip to help make up for damaged film. As far as the cuts and animation quality goes if you've seen the first two parts you should know what to expect in this area.

As with part one and two script wise the Japanese version is about the same despite everything being rerecorded for 2009-2011. Meanwhile the English version sees it's best and most accurate translation ever with a good portion of the Funimation voice cast returning. Even if you are a purist that didn't really care for the English voices in any form at least try to watch it in English at least once. Despite the occassional incident of Funi using the English attack names (such as Solar Flare and Spirit Bomb) for the most part they stick with the Japanese names (Taiyoken and Makankosappo). The set itself cover the battle with the Ginyu Force as well as the early part of the battle with Frieza.

If you don't own any of the season box sets or Dragon Boxes of the original Z then do yourself a favor and pick this up! Just please bear in mind that the DVD/Blu-Ray release of Kai is NOT the edited version on Nicktoons. This release is NOT intended for children and is totally uncut.",1300147200,4,1790,4.518518518518518
4253771,5,B0043988HG,"These are some great looking episodes,dolby true HD does not dissapoint.good fighting in this set,makes it great.

This is a must have for dbz fans",1299369600,,147,4.88
4253772,5,B0043988HG,"I consider myself an expert on DBZ. In fact, I'm Otaku DBZ. I own every episode and movie (legally from Funimation). Naturally, I did not think that Kai could trump its predecessor, the most famous anime of all time. I was so wrong, thankfully. Kai is really, really enjoyable.  They have done an expert job on removing all the filler, kudos to the team for that. Sure the new voices for Gohan and Bulma are a little annoying, but you get used to them pretty quickly. I would classify this series as a must own, for both newbies and Otakus.",1295740800,,540,4.4
4253773,5,B0043988HG,Dragon Ball Z Kai is all the action and story of DBZ without all the filler pulling it down.  The english dub performance is incredible:  Chris Ayres's Frieza is the best acted in this series.  For once I actually enjoyed watching the Namek saga,1294704000,,245,4.5227272727272725
4253774,5,B0043988HG,"I have been watching DBZ for about 10 years now, and I am happy that I can finally watch every episode and not get bored from all the fillers and stand-offs from the original.

Likes-
New intro
Fixing of the scenes that were damaged over the years
Taking out the fillers
Better English dialogue
Excellent sound quality
Pretty much exactly like the manga
New animated breaks in between parts of an episode that actually change as the episodes progress.

Dislikes-
No marathon mode

Part 3 leaves you wanting more of the action! This actually comes with a small extra unlike the other two parts; An interview of some of the English voices from the show. I can not wait for Part 4 to come out, the final battle between Goku and Frieza!",1292371200,10,732,4.53030303030303
4253775,4,B0043988HG,It would be nice if they didn't wait so long between release dates...3 to 4 months is just too long. They should be pumping these out monthly or bi-monthly at the longest.,1288569600,4,171,4.375
4253776,5,B0043988HG,"This set will cover episodes 27-39 of the rebirth of the world's greatest anime- Dragon Ball Z! On the last set, we were introduced to Freeza, Zarbon, and Dodoria. On this set we will see the arrival of Goku at planet Namek, and the Ginyu Force! FUNimation Entertainment is not holding back on these releases, as the sript is outstanding, swearing and all!

I was a little disappointed that Freeza didn't get the cover for this release, but hopefully he will be on Part Four!

This will make a great Christmas present, as it comes out in December!
Support DBZ by buying these sets!",1285977600,11,581,4.576923076923077

8414254,4,B0043988HG,"This is the best I've ever seen Dragonball Z. I admit that the original anime has since bored me while growing up, but Kai reinvigorated my interest in it. The quality is great too. The only reason why I didn't give a full five stars is because it didn't have a great deal of bonus features.",1420156800,,291,4.214285714285714

8414256,4,B0043988HG,"If you're planning to watch Dragon Ball Kai whether it's in Japanese or English, it's ideal to grab the original ""Part"" releases because they have the authentic soundtrack, which not only does it sound, modern but also, cinematic and spectacular.

The picture quality is pretty stunning at times too because they had in store the 36mm film footage which is a lot better than the 16mm (the only one that FUNimation has, for example).

As for the arc itself, the Namek/Freeza arc is definitely better watched through the Kai series than in Z, for the pacing is moderately faster and ideal.",1400371200,,587,4.801980198019802
8414257,3,B0043988HG,I payed quite a bit for this compared to the other low price box sets and what I got was a disappointment. I did not get a slip cover and only got half of the 2 individual dvd artworks. The cds worked great and ran from the captain ginyu saga to the beginning of the fight between goku and frieza. I own 5 of these now and this one just feels incomplete without the 7mm jewel cases and the slip cover and half of the artwork cut off and removed. The video content itself I love but the packaging is cheap as it only came with a 14mm black jewel case with half of the cover art missing. Good try though.,1390867200,,602,3.9834710743801653
8414258,5,B0043988HG,Dragonball Z on blu-ray is all i needed to hear to get excited but having the series filler cut out to match the manga was a great move watching it on toonami back in the day it seemed like five episodes per spirit bomb.,1361664000,,220,4.0227272727272725
8414259,5,B0043988HG,"DB Kai takes Z into the manga story line of the series. Removing filler, this saga is amazingly fun to watch with great fighting and story progress as fast as it should be, unlike Z which takes 40 episodes to meet the enemies and get anywhere in the series.",1354492800,,257,4.26530612244898
8414260,2,B0043988HG,"I tried to get one on here when Amazon was selling this for around 12$.  I waited over a month and received nothing. I eventually received an email that said it was cancelled and that they were not receiving anymore.  Bummer.  I watched some of season 4, pretty good looking, not perfect.  There's no telling whether this version of dbz will play to the end on Blu ray.  I don't like how some seasons are already discontinued, delayed, etc.  Also, what's up with the other versions, 1.2, etc.  They're milking it, and not makeing sure the fans can even complete their collection before coming out with other versions.  Not sure what else to say, Amazon!  I want this for 13$ :)",1332460800,,677,4.528925619834711
