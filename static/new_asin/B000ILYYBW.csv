8146096,1,B000ILYYBW,"Poor sound and video reproduction. This seems to be a copy or knock-off version of another DVD with the exact same title, which is also for sale on Amazon.

This is a great Christmas video but you'd do well to get the original version which is technically superior in all respects.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-In-New-York/dp/B00066X9V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas In New York</a>",1217462400,4,439,6.701754385964913
8146097,1,B000ILYYBW,"I bought this DVD only to discover it is a bootleg (?) version of another DVD with the same title.  The distributor went out of business several years ago and the quality looks like it was copied from another DVD.  Charging over $25 for this adds insult to injury.  If you want to buy this, look for the same title on a white background with different graphics - also for sale on Amazon but at 1/5 cost!  Unless of course you want to give a nice Christmas present to whomever is trying to sell it!",1217462400,,497,4.2
8146098,5,B000ILYYBW,"For those who've experienced the magic in THE CITY for the holidays AND for those who never have as well...this is an excellent holiday-mood video.

GREAT gift item too - tops my list.",1204243200,,184,4.575757575757576
8146099,5,B000ILYYBW,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD HOPING TO SEE AND FEEL LIKE I WAS IN NEW YORK AT CHRISTMAS TIME, AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!  I AM SO GLAD THAT I BOUGHT IT!  I WILL PROBABLY WATCH IT YEAR AROUND!  YOU TOO, WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU BUY THIS DVD!",1198195200,,237,3.795918367346939
