I know DVD can handle suround sound and full even, 7.2 format.  and it still has a good picture.  Blue ray has better Picture, and that option needs to be offered, too.  I don't like the formats that limit the playback media to, only certian limited players.  this country needs to improve the copyright laws, so that if a video is not offered in DVD, or Blue ray, we can record our own in those formats.",1299456000,3,557,4.149532710280374
