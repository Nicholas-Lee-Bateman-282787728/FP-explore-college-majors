7806908,3,6300230252,"The United States Football League played for just three seasons (1983-85), so very few legitimately released videos exist of its existence. Halcyon Days Productions released at least two videos of USFL footage, the first of which was 1987's ""Pro Football Funnies."" When I acquired this title about 15 years ago, I didn't know what to expect, save that it would not be an NFL Films video. I'm sure that those who participated in the league would not view their time there as a joke, but there's plenty to suggest that these teams weren't of NFL caliber in any way.

The inspiration for ""Pro Football Funnies"" is obvious - NFL Films has done a number of ""Follies"" films. Writer Jeff Scott has written a production with some structure. Anything that could go wrong during the course of a USFL contest is covered, beginning with a botched coin toss and ending with a power outage that ended a losing streak for the Denver Gold. Miscues on offense, defense, and special teams are included. Games played in rain and snow show how a playing field can turn into one huge slide - and one big mess. Big losing streaks are also a target. Fans and cheerleaders are caught in embarrassing moments. Referees blow calls. Even Steve Young, who started his pro career in the USFL, is shown not paying attention during warm-up tosses.

The motivational techniques of Memphis Showboats coach Pepper Rodgers get a special spotlight. During a pre-game pep talk, he tells his team he has no idea how they'll win a game - they're just going to do it. In another talk, Rodgers promises his players hot dogs if the Showboats win. The video also shows him in very animated moments on the sidelines. It's just as much fun to watch his moves as it is to hear him speak.

Another spotlight is on a series entitled ""Fabulous Finales,"" where one play spells the difference between victory and defeat. My favorite involves Showboats running back Alan Reid. In the closing minutes of a tie game, Reid takes a handoff, promptly loses twenty yards, and gets tackled in the end zone for a safety. That safety was the margin of victory for their opponents, the Jacksonville Bulls. These game-deciding plays show even the pros aren't immune from mistakes.

Narrator Curt Chaplin serves as an adequate guide through the blunders in this 30-minute video, but his delivery doesn't leave the indelible impression John Facenda made when he narrated for NFL Films, including their ""Follies"" series. It's also clear that a lot of the USFL footage is video, and doesn't have the sharp pictures seen in NFL highlight reels. Still, ""Pro Football Funnies"" manages to capture the lighter moments of the USFL, even when these pros made high school teams look good by comparison. While ""Pro Football Funnies"" won't be the sort of highlight footage some USFL fans will want, it's one of the few of the league that can be acquired at all. It shows some of the league's most fun moments. The losing teams may be the only ones who beg to differ.

7806909,3,6300230252,PRO FOOTBALL FUNNIES is an outakes and bloopers reel that features USFL (1983-1985) footage.  Aside from the humor value of watching the rain come down in Noah/flood proportions in Jacksonville or Denver Gold Coach Craig  Morton having fits with his headset....it is classic USFL!,961113600,2,280,5.340909090909091
