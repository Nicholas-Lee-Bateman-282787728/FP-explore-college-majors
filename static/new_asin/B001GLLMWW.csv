3614429,5,B001GLLMWW,"I watched this movie while I was recuperating from a broken leg.  The beauty of the country settings was breath taking.  Emma Samms was a little weak in her part, but Bruce Greenwood was breathtaking.  It made me take notice of the title and since I got to watch the entire movie without commercials I had no idea what the name was. I just remember Emma from General Hospital and Bruce's stunning good looks.",1295568000,4,408,4.486486486486487
3614430,5,B001GLLMWW,"Treacherous Beauties is a wonderful story of romance and intrigue. Bruce Greenwood and Emma Samms are great together. They don't have to say a word for you to sense their attraction to each other. The smoldering look in their eyes says it all. Most of the Harlequin movies I have seen are excellent and this is no exception. If you are looking for romance and intrigue this is a movie you will certainly enjoy. I first watched it from Netflix and enjoyed it so much, I purchased it from Amazon and have watched it several times. I highly recommend this movie. You can't go wrong with Harlequin.",1285113600,4,594,4.5607476635514015
3614431,4,B001GLLMWW,"This is one of the better Harlequin movies I have seen. It has good
actors in it. The story keeps your attention.
  Its even has some steamy sceens.
  If you want a good romance I would go for this one.",1270598400,,202,3.975
3614432,1,B001GLLMWW,"Sorry, I got sucked into this because I was desperate for something to watch, should have read a book.",1258934400,2,102,4.421052631578948
3614433,5,B001GLLMWW,"If you like romances, you will probably enjoy ""Treacherous Beauties"" very much.  The two leads are strong.  Emma Sams is beautiful and warm, and Bruce Greenwood is handsome and winning; he has that certain magnetic spark that he always brings to his roles.  The setting is lovely:  green and wild.  Horses feature prominently in the story and complement the natural beauty. It's a nice little get-away lose yourself in for an evening.",1247875200,12,434,4.972222222222222
3614434,5,B001GLLMWW,I wish there were more movies like this one with the romantic tension between the main characters.  What's interesting is the depth of the story from the different themes entwined.  This is one movie I watch over and over and it doesn't hurt that Bruce Greenwood was very sexy! NOTE: This DVD purchase is in case my VHS fades.  I have dozens of romance movies on VHS from the mid and late 1980s and in the process of replacing them with DVDs since VHS will fade.  The best way to store VHS is vertical with the rewind tape on bottom and away from the sun and humidity even though stored in a box.,1243036800,9,596,4.247787610619469

3614448,2,B001GLLMWW,The story was ok but the acting and story were a bit cheesy that I had to watch it alone without the presence of my family.  It's not one of my proud moments.,1400284800,2,158,3.787878787878788
3614449,5,B001GLLMWW,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I watched this movie everyday for 3 weeks straight, it has 2 of my favorite pepole in it they play the characters of Ann Marie and Jason Hollister(SEXXY,OMG). Ann Marie's(Emma Sams) brother is killed on the ranch where he works and lives and she goes to investigate and find out what happened. The Hollister's who own the ranch have been known to buy there way out of situations. I love the story line and the mystery behind it.  I lovethe cast of characters, however there is a little bit of nudity,but not alot a short seen.  I so enjoyed this movie!!!!!!",1398297600,2,589,4.547169811320755

3614451,5,B001GLLMWW,"Wonderful, great romance from past times - remembers me being younger, when TV showed things like that. Emma Samms acts great, Bruce Greenwood is wonderful.",1371081600,,156,5.28
3614452,5,B001GLLMWW,"I liked the story line immensely.  To trust or not to trust, to love or not to love.  These questions are not so simple when someone is trying to sabotage the relationship.  And it is from the person you would least expect.  That makes for a good mystery and good romance.",1354060800,2,272,4.2745098039215685
3614453,2,B001GLLMWW,"I gave it 2 stars because the horses are beautiful but they do not compensate for the lack of any real mystery or plot. The ""love"" scenes are contrived. Bruce Greenwood with his shirt off and his hair in his eyes washing a horse with the sunlight glinting off of his chest hair is just silly. Buy Last of the Dogmen if you are looking for mystery, love, dogs, horses, Indians and a chic flick even guys like.",1342742400,2,408,4.243589743589744

8305876,3,B001GLLMWW,I don't usually care for this type of movie but I watched it because Bruce Greenwood starred in it. It was actually pretty good but I still think it was enjoyable mainly because Bruce was in it.,1514851200,,194,4.27027027027027

8305879,3,B001GLLMWW,"It was a decent movie, had it's moments of being good, but nothing special. Felt some stuff jumped forward too much, but the murder mystery component at least added a slight interesting twist.",1508544000,,192,4.848484848484849
