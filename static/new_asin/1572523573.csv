190024,3,1572523573,"There is a problem with the subtitles - at least with the DVD version of this movie - which makes following the story very difficult.  [I don't usually mind subtitles - in most subtitled movies, I've forgotten that I'm reading them and have no problem with them.)
The subtitles appear on the screen only during the *exact* time the words are being spoken, and not a second longer.  This means that it's very hard to read two-line subtitles, and often hard to even read multi-word single-line subtitles.
I'm a quick reader, but there were dozens of times during this film where I'd be watching the characters and completely miss what the subtitle said.  Or, I'd get frustrated and spend my time focused on the subtitles and miss the actions and expressions of the characters.
Apart from the technical aspects, the plot and situations are right out of a ""Lifetime Movie of the Week"", but the characters are fascinating. I found myself thinking about the characters and their inter-relationships days after the movie ended.",998265600,9,1020,4.884393063583815
190025,4,1572523573,"Michel (Guy Marchand) falls in love with Jewish refuge Lena (Isabelle Huppert) at first sight and offers marriage as a way she can avoid being sent to a German concentration camp.  She accepts, and although she doesn't love him, they have two children and are still married when we pick up the action again in Lyons in 1952 when Lena is 29-years-old.  There she meets the sophisticated and well-to-do artist Madeleine (Miou-Miou) who awakens her to the drabness of her existence as a housewife with a loutish husband who now runs a gas station.  The attraction between Lena and Madeleine is very strong, and very threatening to the men, especially to Michel.

Huppert's poignant and bittersweet portrayal reminds me of her delicate work in Madame Bovary (1991).  There is the same listlessness expressed along with a vague desire for something better out of life, and the anticipation of the sadness that we know will come of such desire.  Miou-Miou is sharp and cynical with perhaps a streak of the manic-depressive about her.  The love they spontaneously feel for one another is real and beautiful and makes us want it to be fulfilled.  But Lena holds herself back because of her family, and then it is the men and propriety that get in the way.

Of course this is very French and Lena and Madeleine hold hands and comfort one another while telling each other their innermost secrets including the infidelities of their spouses, etc.  (The men have no such communication.)  Director Diane Kurys exercises more restraint in showing the physical nature of their mutual attraction than would be displayed today.  Lena says to Madeleine at one point, ""I want to kiss you,"" but we do not see them kissing.  The most explicit scene sexually is the startling, but delicately expressed, meeting with the soldiers on the train where we discover the full extent of Lena's frustration.

This is not quite a great movie.  The pace is a little slow in spots and sometimes the focus is not as sharp as it could be.  But it is an extraordinarily honest movie, and I'll take that over sharp technique any day.  Huppert is not only at her best here, but her exquisite and subtle beauty is shown to great advantage.  Miou-Miou is also very pretty of course--this is the first time I've seen her--so I would say her strength of character is perhaps her strongest suit.  This is a human tragedy on a small, intimate scale, one that we can't help but feel could have been averted had those involved understood one another better, had they been a little wiser.  We've all been there before and so we can share the sadness and the sense of loss.

190037,1,1572523573,"I had to watch this flick in my French cinema class and about walked out it was so ridiculous. If you enjoy movies where you pretty much like everyone else other then the main characters then go see it. Basically the movie focuses on these two women that obviously are in love with each other. Throughout the movie they cheat on their husbands with other men, abandon their children like they don't matter, and more simply put revert to being teenagers with no respect for others even though they both are married with children. *SPOILER* One husband was such a great father to his children you hoped that the two women would just leave to go do their lesbian thing and never come back but no, the women decided to take the children with them and leave their husbands. Freaking ridiculous. This movie was based off of a true story of the own director's childhood and boy do I feel bad for her.",1204588800,6,893,4.484662576687117
190038,4,1572523573,"We learn about two women Helene and Madeleine.  We meet Helene in WWII France in the Jewish women camp about to be send off to the concentration camp.  Her beauty meets the eye of a man who offers her marriage that she accepts as a means of avoiding the concentration camp.  At the same time, Madeleine is an art student married to a colleague student who tragically gets killed during one of the student riots.  10 years later, in the early 1950s both women get to know each other after attending their children's school rehearsal.  By now, Helene has two daughters and Madeleine has a son.  Both are trapped in the marriages that can only be described as loveless arrangements of convenience.  Their respective husbands see them as a possesions to have and show off to the outside world, creatures destined to stay home and tend to their children.  But as the friendship between the two women develops, their frustration with their lives starts to simmer.  They try to cover their dissatisfaction with love affirs, or one time encounters with the strangers, until they both come to realize how strong their mutual attraction for each other is.  Both women understand each other and feel each other's emotional void they experience with their husbands.  Their innate sense of style, strong desire for independence and want for meaningful existance draws them together to the frustration of both of their husbands. While movie never shows sexually explicit connection between two women their need for each other is obvious.  Nothing seems to be able to stop it and social norms of the time are to be broken regardless of the consequences.  Based on the life and experiences of director's mother this is a powerful story.  It is also impossible to believe that Isabelle Huppert made this film 20 almost years ago.  She is still equally beautiful, but I finally got to understand how she established herself as an actress portraying very emotionally complicated women.",1196985600,2,1966,4.915151515151515
190039,4,1572523573,"The best movies, like the best novels, are those that present characters in such a way that you can't help getting involved with their lives, in having a strong reaction to them. This is one of those movies and the reaction I get from it is negative: I want to shake these characters by the shoulders to get them to stop what they're doing.

Set in Lyon, France, during the 1950s, two women become very close friends (lovers actually) and want to escape from the confines of their marriages and their husbands. One is married to a selfish schemer who deals on the blackmarket; the other to a garage owner who loves nothing more than playing with his kids. The two womwn feel ""trapped"" and ""confined"" by these men, and long to be ""free.""

If director Kurys wants the viewer to feel sympathetic toward these two ""modern"" women, she's failed miserably with me: they come across as little more than selfish flakes. The men have their problems, too (insensitive, doting), but they at least appear more honest. I know feminism meant different things in different parts of the world, and this movie deals with French concerns (which are different than American or Arabic or Chinese), but it's really difficult to swallow. As a piece of movie making it is very well done - and certainly evokes very strong reactions. I wonder what the validity quotient of this movie is today, even in France.",1131753600,3,1384,4.691358024691358
190040,5,1572523573,"The beuty of the film lies in its subtle power to transmit the complexity of when family obligations come in the way of self-fullfilment. The film is based on the true story of the the film maker's mother and was a cathartic process for Kurys, who was very close to her father and mourned his seperation from her life. Kurys exhaults her mother's strength and independace in the face of 1950s tradition but does not entirely pardon her for splitting up the family. The narritive is also a feminist consciousness-raising exercise to the extent that it invites the spectator to share in the protagonists' growing awareness of their unsatisfactory lives as married women in the pre-feminist patriarchal world of the 1950s. And though Kurys maintains that her mother's relationship with her female remained platonic, the movie is full of shared looks and pauses that suggest a desire between the two women. the intensity of the their attraction (wether platonic or otherwise) is expressed through the small seemingly meaningless phrases that we utter when we are overrun with emotion. One may postulate that had the relationship between the two women evovled in a different time where the idea of a lesbian affair would not have been so 'unthinkable' their feelings could have bloosemed into a sexual affair.",1070409600,11,1304,5.041666666666667
190041,5,1572523573,"This movie is one of the top 10 in my list. It describes the special nature of female-female friendships and how we women have to rely on each other to survive the slings and arrows of an outrageous patriarchy. However, the movie does, unfairly I think, portray men in a rather negative light. This is just not realistic in the global perspective. On the other hand, if I had a daughter, I would make sure that she owned this DVD. The players in this movie are fantabulous actresses. The plot is believable. The direction and cinematography are a cut above the norm. I would rate this 6 stars if I could.",1052870400,8,604,4.45045045045045
190042,1,1572523573,"This movie is definitely a love story between two women, regardless of what Isabella from Texas (say no more)wants to believe.  I think she needs to watch the movie again and this time, read the subtitles.  I originally viewed this movie on A&E in the mid 80's and specifically remember reading that the director is one of ""Lena's"" daughters.  I am not saying that two women would leave their husbands and live together for years, and not be lesbians, however, the odds are quite remote.  Having lived in the gay community for 25 years, I think I know a lesbian subtext when I see it.  It is really sad that someone who is heterosexual wants to deny we lesbians our love stories.  It is especially pathetic when we are constantly bombared with heterosexual everything.  I think any lesbian and enlightend straight women would love this movie as much as I did.  This is definitely a ""must see"" for lesbians and all thoe straight women out there who cannot stand their husbands.",1032480000,10,976,4.666666666666667
190043,5,1572523573,"I saw this movie based on the recommendation of my friend whose review has been posted for this movie. I was warned, however, to be prepared for what comes after my review or rating. Apparently if you like this movie you will get a bunch of recommendations and referrals to lesbian movies as my friend is now getting and becoming quite irritated with it. I can only smile because I guess, it is rather hard to escape the assumption based on this movie. I agree that this is a beautiful movie about friendship. It is difficult, however, for modern women to accept the fact that there are deep friendships bordering on physical tenderness and deep emotional bonds without having sexual relations and remain heterosexual, enjoy one's marriage or relation with the opposite sex. In some cultures, for example, it is not uncommon for girls and adult female friends to hold each other's hands or put one's arm around a friend's waist in public without being a lesbian. Such friendships are also marked by deep emotional bonds not only with each other but with the friend's family. Certainly such public display or type of relationship would be miscontrued as a lesbian act in the US. Over the fear, perhaps annoyance, of being innundated by lesbian movie recommendations from ..., I rate this movie with five stars. Isabelle Huppert is a magnificent actress. This is a beautiful story about the bond of friendship, albeit interpreted as a lesbian affair - thus degrading its true value. The great philosopher Aristotle described the three types of friendship - a friendhip out of need; a friendship out of mutual satisfaction and the highest level being that of a friendship out of virtue. This is a story of a friendship out of virtue!",1027382400,15,1730,4.828282828282828
190044,5,1572523573,"This is a beautifully made movie. What fantastic performances from Isabelle Huppert, Miou-Miou and Guy Marchand. No wonder Huppert is considered a diva. She is a great actress. When she laughs, you laugh. When she is sad, you are sad and when she is angry, you are angry. This movie is an example why the French consider movie making an art and a national tradition. This is a poignant and moving story of the strength of friendship and of jealousy. Think of spending Saturday with your girlfriend shopping and coming home to a jealous boyfriend or husband, or being upset with your boyfriend or husband because he spends endless hours discussing politics or NASCAR with his friend. This movie goes deeper but you will understand the meaning of friendship and why friends gather from and give strength to each other and of the irritating emotion of jealousy. This movie is eloquently written and superbly acted. While viewing this movie it would not be unusual to feel ambivalent emotions. The movie constantly elicits joy, seriousness, laughter, and sadness. If you do not speak French the subtitles may be disruptive. You may find yourself ocassionally reviewing the scenes to read the subtitles. But I could not take my eyes away from the screen. It is a pleasure to look at Huppert and Miou-Miou, they are beatiful and so are the clothes! This was the first French movie I have seen in a long time. Since then I have purchased other French movies. Why do French movies always make you think for a long time after you have seen it?

7797888,3,1572523573,"I had not seen this film since it was shown on Cinemax in the mid-1980s. In addition to its feminist themes, it also affords a fascinating glimpse of non-conventional life in 1950s France, outside of Paris (Lyon, in this case).

When I played this disk on a 50"" LED HDTV, I was dismayed to see thick black bars both above AND on each side of the image as well, so that the image displayed is only 50-60% of what it would have been had it been displayed full size (full diagonal size with black bars above/below). Even worse, the subtitles are projected into the black bar BELOW the image. My tv can zoom in to give a 16:9 full screen (full width----with thin black bars above/below) view, but then the subtitles are lost because the subtitles reside in black bar below the image. Since I don't speak or understand much French, I depend on the subtitles. The tv has a stretch option which makes the image appear distorted (too wide) and in any case the subtitles are still lost with this option. So the only way to watch the film and see the subtitles is ""normal"" view with very thick black bars on all sides-----with a film obviously made in widescreen 16:9 format with beautiful cinematography.

I've never owned any disk before with subtitles projected into a black bar below the image. I wonder if perhaps this is (or was, at the time) less expensive than projecting them onto the film image. Technically speaking, the disk has very little in the way of extra features, which indicates to me that the disk must have been released years ago. I don't buy disks solely for the extra features, and the primitive menu format suggests to me that they employed an early, no-longer-in-use method of putting subtitles in the lower black bar. This could have been intended for viewing in the 4:3 CRT era, when the image would have stretched fully across the picture tube with black bars only above and below. Some disks on the market were released when most viewers still had CRT televisions, and some evidently are not optimized for use on a HDTV with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The problem with viewing this title on an 16:9 HDTV is that the viewer gets thick black bars on all sides and a miniature image. The menu does not offer ""set up options"" to remedy the situation, as this disk is from the early days of DVD transfers. Zooming in to get a full size image works only for those fluent in French, who can afford to lose the subtitles. I cannot.

Five stars for film content, one star for technical aspects of the disk.

Note: the earliest reviews of this disk go back to c. 2001, which reinforces my view that the odd subtitle format in the lower black bar is a long-discarded technique that didn't pan (pun intended) out. Another reviewer noted that the subtitles flash on and off very quickly, and I agree: in several key scenes, I had to backtrack because I could not read the subtitle in its entirely before it disappeared. I enjoy foreign language films in languages in which I""m fluent (German, Spanish) and languages I have not studied, such as French, and I'm adept at reading subtitles quickly...so when they are too fast for me, they are likely too fast for the average viewer as well.",1399334400,,3189,4.550522648083624

Huppert marries a soldier at the camp who's not Jewish, but Miou-Miou and her husband go to other countries and don't return to France until after the war.  The movie is about the friendship between these two women through the birth of children, the death of Miou-Miou's husband, and Huppert's attempts to find some independence by opening a shop.  I think a bit of editing could have made the film a bit tighter.
