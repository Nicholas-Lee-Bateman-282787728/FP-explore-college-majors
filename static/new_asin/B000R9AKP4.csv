2862756,5,B000R9AKP4,"I was asked to review this video by a friend who wants to learn, but is very shy.  The Hula moves taught here are explained easy enough for the newest person to understand.  I have been dancing for 24 years and was fortunate to study with a halau (Hula School).  The only thing you'll miss out on is the critique of a Kumu Hula.  So, if you're doing it wrong, you won't know, but if this is your only option, go for it!  Some advise...be patient with yourself!",1264118400,12,460,4.181818181818182
2862757,2,B000R9AKP4,"I have had many years of professional dance experience, but not in hula, and wanted to learn it.  However, this is very much a beginner's level video for someone who has never studied dance before.  The instructor breaks down every movement in such detail and in such a quiet, monotone voice that you almost fall asleep watching it.  The dance demonstration also moves too slow.  It is very boring and I never did finish watching it.  Very disappointing.",1253664000,8,454,4.769230769230769
2862758,5,B000R9AKP4,"I was expecting a glossy, semi-Hollywoodesque video.  Instead, the Kumu Hula is very real, and it feels like she's giving you private instruction because of some of the word-grasping that she does and some of the non-polished aspects of the video.  It's a great video.  The lessons are simple, and they remind me of when I was taking in-person hula classes from a Kumu.

Although it's sometimes hard to completely understand what the Kumu is asking students to do, her assistant being able to show the end product really helps.  I do wish the assistant had chosen another color of shorts to wear, however, as it's hard to see discrete leg movement with a mass of solid black and legs.

I did expect to learn even a simple dance, and except for the practices (slow, medium, or fast), there is nothing put together into a dance for the student as a kind of culmination of the DVD's learning.  At the same time, I like the format where the step is presented and repeated during instruction, and then a few minutes of practice immediately follow.  By learning/practicing two or three of the steps, and then adding all three of the practices, I not only get to enjoy the beauty of hula, but I also get a great workout.",1242345600,25,1213,4.557603686635945
2862759,3,B000R9AKP4,"Enjoyed the video, but it is missing the printed instruction booklet it says it comes with.  I don't know how to contact Amazon directly to have this sent out separately.",1240963200,9,170,4.666666666666667
2862760,5,B000R9AKP4,"This DVD is very informative and worth every penny.  Everything you need to know about hula is on this DVD.  Do not be discouraged by the word ""Intensive"" in the title of this DVD.  Kumu Kea is a great teacher and explains everything in detail and with kindness.  The steps are thoroughly explained and presented in such a way that even a beginner will feel a sense of accomplishment as they learn each new step.  Take your time with this DVD. It is quite lengthy, but you will not feel rushed into learning the steps.  I have purchased several DVD's of this type, but no longer used them anymore.  I put ""Basic Hula"" on top of the list for learning hula dancing.",1214438400,25,663,4.385245901639344

2862762,5,B000R9AKP4,"This is a great introduction to Hula dance.  Kumu Kea walks us through the steps with detailed and specific instructions which are demonstrated by the lovely Manumele.

2862763,4,B000R9AKP4,I have enjoyed this DVD Very much. I have resently moved to a place where a Hula group is not available. This DVD has been a great help in keeping up the things that I have learned as well as learning some new steps and practice!!!!!!!!!,1206057600,6,237,4.173913043478261
2862764,5,B000R9AKP4,"As a teacher of dance, this video will help you help your students improve technique.  As a student, it will open your eyes to the true meaning of Hula in a sincere and technically correct way.

We here on the mainland may not have a true view of what this dance from the islands is all about and where its roots are. This basic video will dispell a lot of notions about Hula and shows the real challenging and rewarding aspects of the dance, technical and graceful.  It is a winner...I wish I had owned it 20 years ago...",1197072000,47,522,4.252525252525253

The lessons are very detailed and easy to follow. There is a special section on hand movements and how to achieve them. From the menu you can pick individual lessons or practice sessions and repeat them as often as needed. This is a wonderful, well organized video for beginners.",1436227200,3,431,4.684210526315789

2862776,5,B000R9AKP4,"This 2 hour video covers 16 foundation steps. The instructor is a kumu hula, and the ""student""  is one of her uniki. There's also sections on stance/posture and how to develop fluid hand movements.  Another reviewer was disappointed that there were no hand gestures, but all beginners in a halau learn footwork first --- for several months in fact. Hand and arm movements come into play when you get into choreography later.

The dancer stands facing a mirror so you won't be confused about right or left. This halau uses ai ha'a style (bent knee) and their female dancers do the uweke, rather than the uwehe which they consider unladylike. Those are the only things that might be different if you join a halau later.",1430611200,5,717,4.72

2862781,4,B000R9AKP4,"I learned at a Halau from Auntie Christina in Laie, Oahu, Hawaii pre-Polynesian Cultural Center [PCC] and during the Hukilau Beach luau days.  She continued to train me when I danced at PCC in the 1960s.  Those training still is part of my life when I dance.  This DVD returns the names of the movements and the basic hula posture and structure...so many memories coming back to me while I live in rural CO in the mountains.

2862784,5,B000R9AKP4,"I just wanted to add my praises for this excellent video.  The review by ""Amity"" (Mar 29, 2012) sums up the format very well so I would direct readers to that review.  I also belly dance and I have yet to find a belly dance instructional DVD executed in the excellent format seen on this hula DVD.
Very easy to follow. I had my husband download the DVD onto my iPhone to make practice easy and accessible.",1384300800,4,405,4.246753246753247
2862785,2,B000R9AKP4,"I bought this DVD based on reviews, and expected more for the price. It is an instructional video, so I don't know why others are commenting that they didn't get a good workout- you should buy a workout DVD for that. The instruction cueing and demonstration are perfectly fine, video quality and set is okay (I heard some background noise in the first 5-10 minutes), but I think this could be accomplished in a $15 DVD.

As an experienced Egyptian dancer, I found this to be a bit too slow for me, and for $40 I expected to get more cultural and history lessons on the dance, as well as proper costuming and apparel. I did appreciate the demonstration of and verbal cueing of rolling through the feet, proper arm position, etc.

***My  unopened, new DVD package did not include the booklet that stated was included***",1381968000,16,817,4.582191780821918

2862787,5,B000R9AKP4,Allowed me plenty of practice to execute the basic hula steps correctly. I just joined a bginner's hula class and needed to get up to speed on getting the correct footwork in place before learning the choreography. This fit the bill. The only complaint I have is that it should have a menu where you can choose what you want to focus on rather than having to fast forward each time.,1375142400,,382,4.394366197183099
2862788,5,B000R9AKP4,This video was expensive; but so very worth it.  I joined a hula group and was able to do all the basic steps like the pros. Thank you.,1365552000,4,135,3.8214285714285716
2862789,4,B000R9AKP4,"Excellent DVD for learning basic Hula.......however, the booklet was not with the DVD. I might not even need it, but it was missing.",1363219200,2,132,4.782608695652174
2862790,4,B000R9AKP4,"Great intensive old style hula instruction and practice video. No booklet included,although it is indicated on DVD packaging, but video was enough on its own.",1358121600,2,158,5.36
2862791,5,B000R9AKP4,"While this is a rather technical introduction to hula with lots of steps, you've probably had fun with Kili's less intensive workouts.  This is the first in a large series of works that demonstrate ancient kahiki dances and modern auana dances.  You'll be transported from an old culture to the 1950's and up to dancing to modern ballads.  The beautiful hand gestures describe their culture with grace and deep meaning.

The website is a truly generous education in the world of Hawaiians.  She gives us recipes, videos of the state and all sorts of information.  You are left with enough knowledge of place to act and let the movement flow with the added coordination of the emotional level of acting.

Real Hula as a whole is a deeply moving experience.",1345593600,3,755,4.7615384615384615
2862792,5,B000R9AKP4,"Kumu Kea does a great job of breaking down each of the steps covered in this video.  Even if you are an experienced hula dancer like myself, it is good to see how other schools teach their steps.  Although there is no choreographed dance included, it does include a basic sample of the steps put together at 3 different tempos.  The video quality is kind of like old VHS, but that did not matter to me.  I bought this because I wanted to see the steps broken down so I can start to teach my daughter hula.  We don't live near any Halau right now and I want to teach her the properly.
I had tried just demonstrating for her, but found I did not have the words to explain what I was doing.  Now with this video I do.  The steps done as drills also make a great workout! I have also tried some of Real Hula's choreography videos which are well done also.",1339200000,4,851,4.121212121212121
2862793,5,B000R9AKP4,"This DVD teaches the art of the dance of Hula. As the title implies, the lessons are Basic and meant for beginners. It is intensive because of the detail which is required for proper dance instruction. This is not a DVD for one who is interested in an exercise workout. I myself have taught classes in dance other than Hula, and taught in the same manner as this teacher. I feel fortunate to have found a DVD that offers lessons given by one who clearly shares her love and knowledge of the art of Hula.",1336262400,8,503,4.3052631578947365
2862794,4,B000R9AKP4,This was really helpful in helping me practice at home The steps were very easy to follow and the teacher explains everything so well..My only complaint is it would have been nice to have a nice soundtrack with this and also to have shot it in a better location. It seems very low budget....it looks like it was shot in a  room without windows and just a mirror in someones house by amateurs. Why not film this in a beautiful location like the beach or in a garden  with nicer music?  I practice with this daily and In spite of all this the teacher and the dancer are just great and I have to rate it high for that alone!~just expect a VERY  basic but very well informed and easy to follow dvd.,1334620800,8,694,4.195488721804511
2862795,4,B000R9AKP4,"I have been belly dancing for about eight years and took a hula workshop a couple years ago. After that I bought the DVD ""Intro to Polynesian Dance"" which was put out with the support of the Belly Dance Super Stars. It was interesting and fun, and I could kind of figure out how they were doing most of the moves because I am familiar with the similar movements of belly dance. However, Basic Hula is FAR better for someone who is just starting and wants to see how the moves are done. Each movement is broken down with the demonstrating dancer in front of a mirror so you see back and front views, while the instructor verbally explains what the dancer is doing. She also gives excellent tips for what NOT to do. Each move is then practiced in slow motion, and then at tempo with the drum being played. Another thing that I like is that each move is displayed on the screen so you see how it is written as well as hear the instructor pronounce it. This covers many moves, and at the end there are three practice sections at slow, medium, and fast tempos where the instructor drums and calls out moves and you follow along with what the demonstrating dancer does. It's an excellent way to learn the names of the moves and practice transitioning between them. The instructor also points out several times that there are different styles of hula so if you've had lessons from a different instructor there may be differences, but they are not a matter of ""right or wrong"", just a matter of style. The video is a little old and obviously didn't have a large budget, but they did an excellent job with what resources they have. I rented this on instant to see if I liked it but I will definitely be purchasing the DVD to keep. The closest hula instructors to me are a 2 1/2 hour drive away so I am VERY happy that this is available. It really is a close as you can get to taking a real class. I would recommend it for anyone! By the way on the realhula website they also have DVDs of full choreographies, which I also plan to purchase after I have mastered the Basic Hula :)",1332979200,22,2069,4.3076923076923075

8199565,3,B000R9AKP4,"An honorable attempt to teach a beautiful sacred dance, but for the price I expected more.  What is given here is very basic steps and their Hawaiian names and not much at all in the way of hand movements or their meaning. During  the practice you see the teacher using hand movements that were not ever taught.  If you are only interested in the basic feet and hip movements and not so much the hands, then this video will perhaps suffice but I think most people want more comprehensive instruction.  I am going to have to drive an hour to take lessons that will teach me what I hoped this video would.",1472774400,3,603,4.357142857142857

They kept me going and greatly enhanced my education. I love her teaching style. I'm going to be downloading as many of these as I can because my DVDs are getting old. A few words after reading a couple of less-than-flattering reviews: First, these are NOT really meant to be workout videos. They are traditional hula instruction, so if you're looking for cardio or weight loss with hula, look elsewhere. Also, these were originally VHS videos (I owned some back then). So as a result, they may not be as sleek and polished as you are accustomed to. That doesn't detract from their value. For those of you wishing for more instruction on culture and dress, Kumu has a lot of material on her Real Hula interactive website, so be sure to check that out.",1471910400,3,922,4.494047619047619
