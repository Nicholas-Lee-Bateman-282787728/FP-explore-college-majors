6410847,3,B00KALQI1O,"It was OK...nothing great....Brooke was not very good, like a Disney sitcom actress, though not as hysterical.

Always nice to see Mr. Burns.",1409616000,,141,5.130434782608695
6410848,5,B00KALQI1O,"A young Brooke Sheilds and an old George Burns put one of the best team performances on film.  Watch for Carl Balentine, Keye Luke, and many other classic movie figures as supporting cast.",1408752000,3,188,4.696969696969697
6410849,4,B00KALQI1O,"It is entertaining, funny and feel-good.  It is a treat for those of us who remember George Burns  from the Burns and Allen shows, and it a great opportunity for those who never had that pleasure to treat themselves to a very entertaining movie.  It is also a very good family movie for all.",1406419200,3,291,4.351851851851852

6410852,5,B00KALQI1O,I've watched George Burns since I was a kid and he was always funny and this movie just shows that George was like a fine wine. I really liked this movie and anyone who likes a good comedy will enjoy this one.,1405382400,3,209,4.0
6410853,5,B00KALQI1O,"I haven't seen this 35 year old movie in 20+ years, and it was actually better than I remember it. This edition from Sony Choice Collection is 94:59 long and in 1:85:1 aspect ratio.",1402963200,7,181,4.352941176470588
6410854,5,B00KALQI1O,"This is a great film that is finally released on DVD.  However, the Amazon listing shows that 18 minutes were apparently cut from the film.  IMDM and everyone else shows the film as 93 minutes, including my VHS copy.  Amazon shows a running time of 75 minutes.  This is a terrible loss of content.

Update 6/18/2014 - Wrote to Amazon advising them that their web site showed 75 minutes and sent them a link to the IMDB.com data base which confirms 93 minutes.  Amazon this morning said in an email to me WRONG ----  ""...link does not verify 93 minutes..."".  Well they need to get new staff to check these things.  They DVD arrived this afternoon and it is in fact 95 minutes long and the aspect ratio is 1.85:1.",1402704000,9,711,4.407692307692308
6410855,5,B00KALQI1O,"I got this video for my 7 year old daughter who is a little pudgy.  She and my 6 year old daughter have done it two days in a row so far and really enjoy it.  I haven't been able to participate yet, but am intending on it.  My youngest was actually asking to do it again once it was over. Great family activity.  The routines are well explained and energetic.  Thanks!",1262736000,,368,4.055555555555555
6410856,5,B00KALQI1O,"I remember watching this movie over and over as a kid on the fairly new HBO channel.  Yep, I'm old. 
Loved it then and watching it now just takes me back!",1499385600,,154,3.935483870967742
6410857,5,B00KALQI1O,"To me this is an old fashioned mid range budget film that had a solid cast, good humor, and nothing really tawdry (although you see the backside of miss Brooke's stunt-double).  It the kind of film that they used to make a great deal, but seems to have fallen by the way side.  For all the runaways from broken homes with parents who fell into vices, this film is for you.

The impeccable George Burns carries the film with his usual understated witty performance, and when things come to a head.  And with all star Vaudevillian support cast of Hollywood greats, the film really shines.

The film style is pretty basic.  No overly artistic shots, not CGI, no digital inserts, none of the stuff that's become the trend in today's hyper film making atmosphere, as well as no real social psychology message, just a story that itself is the message without the benefit (or curse) of the studio marketing psychologists.

And that's refreshing, because had this film been made today, then Brooke's character would have been droning on about how hard her life was.  Burns' character would have been a burnt out humorless case.  We would have had a lot of ""sky cam"" wire work, CGI stunt cars, and the one SFX in this film would have been green-screened to death.  Fortunately this film was made a couple of decades ago.

Give it a shot and see what you think.

Enjoy.",1497225600,,1359,4.593360995850622

6410859,5,B00KALQI1O,"This movie is wonderful. George Burns was fantastic along side Brook Shields, and the other stars that played on this movie. I would have liked to see a second movie with Brook, and Burl Ives and George. It would have been fun to see how the adoption went with the couple that played George's daughter and son - in - law.",1486684800,,321,4.278688524590164

6410866,5,B00KALQI1O,Great wholesome DVD. A must have for fans of Brooke Shields and George Burns. Its another movie that captures the beauty of Ms. Shields and the comedic charm of Mr. George Burns. Good quality DVD in letter box wide screen full aspect ratio.,1460419200,,240,4.604651162790698

6410871,5,B00KALQI1O,"Saw this as a kid back in summer ""79"" liked it then, love it now. Great supporting cast. Can never go wrong in a movie that started the late comic genius of George Burns and the Incomprably Gorgeous Brooke Shields, who happens to be 1 of my daughter's middle name's. Worth seeing. Takes you back to simpler times when life was much less complicated and virtually technically-free, a whole other era, surprisingly a welcome delight.",1446422400,,431,4.76
6410872,5,B00KALQI1O,"Looking for this movie for a while and leave it to amazon to have just what I want, thanks amazon",1444089600,,97,3.9
6410873,3,B00KALQI1O,"OK, this is not a great movie.  Brooke Shields is cute but can't even vaguely do ""tough.""  The chief charm of the movie - and I've been looking for this one for a while - is watching George Burns.  He does wonderful stand up and vaudeville pieces that fall completely flat with his audience - which rather adds to their charm.  He says some very insightful things about age and watching the world move past you.  This is a good Sunday afternoon film.",1443052800,2,450,4.373493975903615
6410874,5,B00KALQI1O,I was waiting along time for this movie to be on DVD or VHS. The movie was at least as good in video quality as originally seen on TV if not better.,1441497600,,148,3.65625

6410882,4,B00KALQI1O,"George was still in top form and Brooke was lovely and each blended with the other for a likable flick.  Perhaps Miss Shields' most endearing performance in the period of Pretty Baby, Wanda Nevada, Blue Lagoon, etc.",1427241600,,215,4.8108108108108105

8656962,5,B00KALQI1O,I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it.  I didn't get to see it in 1979 in the theater. I saw it on TV but found it delightfully enjoyable about a runaway on the lamb from a drug dealer then turns up in George Burns's car.  In the trunk.  Naked.  Then the real fun begins.  Don't turn away from this movie.  Buy it and watch it. It is adorable. It's cute. It's funny.,1530144000,,376,3.9466666666666668
