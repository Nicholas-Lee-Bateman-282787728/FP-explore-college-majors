227346,4,6300213234,"The older the wine, the better.  same with ""old"" american films: the scenography or make-up might appear funny nowadays, but the approach of the film directors was maybe - more human. I liked the film, I liked the  conclusion, and consider this TOS episode not the best one, but one of the  well-made beginnings od s-f as we know it now. Actually - the one who has  perhaps the most connotations with the golden era - 50ties sf... Enjoy!",931046400,,437,4.493670886075949
7805194,5,6300213234,"I'm the ninth person to give this episode Five Stars and the fourteenth overall to rate it.

From the opening scene this episode grabs you. I remember seeing it as a kid at my Grandparent's house for the first time. I loved it then and I still love it now even more. The scene at Cestus III base is a classic. I love how Kirk takes command and sends out Lang and Kelowitz to reconnoiter the area. He and Spock manage to neutralize the alien commando force and give chase up in space.

Both vessels are captured by the Metrons, a metrosexual race of creatures if ever there was one. These beings force the Gorn and Human to fight one another. Kirk is able to use his brains over the brawn of the Gorn and wins the reprieve from death that looked to be around the corner. But he shows mercy to the Gorn and wins the admiration of the Metrons. This enables him to leave knowing he did the right thing.

The costume for the Gorn was remarkable. Even more remarkable was how the actor was able to breathe. The Gorn creature may have been the basis for the Trandoshan species that George Lucas created for Star Wars 12-13 years later in Empire Strikes Back. it too was reptilian and very dangerous but probably not as strong as the Gorn.

This is the best episode of the show's first season and one learns a lesson from the beginning when the mortar rounds are falling amongst the landing party to the duel between the Gorn and captain Kirk. It is Kirk's ingenuity that saves him and his crew from certain death. Buy this on tape and you will love it. It is not available on DVD just by itself. Your choice is to purchase the entire set or to buy the individual tape on VHS which is now out of print. I loved this and so will you if you are a Trekkie.

7805197,5,6300213234,"Some reviewers have complained that Gene Coon ruined a story with such potential. Some say that the Metrons acting like chaperons was stupid. So if we don't have the Metrons what do we have? We have nothing but a space chase and lots of action. Like I have said, good Science Fiction is action and didactic. Well done Gene Coon.",1242259200,,328,4.483333333333333
7805198,4,6300213234,"This is the famous Gorn episode that features a slow-walking lizard man chasing Kirk around a planet. It has a strange history. Producer Gene Coon wrote it as an original episode, but then someone discovered that sci-fi author Frederic Brown had written a story that was in some ways similar, so they gave Brown credit.

If you read Brown's story, you can see the similarity: an Earth man (though not Kirk) is pitted against a malevolent alien in hand-to-hand combat. If the Earth man loses, all humans will be destroyed. In the Trek version, Kirk is forced to fight the much stronger Gorn captain, and the Enterprise will be destroyed if he loses.

Both stories have an anti-war slant. Super-advanced aliens decide it is better to stage a one-on-one battle rather than let two angry races carry on an interstellar war threatening the general peace. But in Coon's version, the anti-war slant is much stronger still. The Gorn race acts and appears savage indeed (what are humans more predjudiced against than reptiles?), but near the end Kirk starts to suspect that the Gorns were only defending their home territory when they blasted a Federation outpost.

One of the virtues of the episode is that is one of the few ""hard science"" shows in Star Trek or any other televised sci-fi show. Actual knowledge of real science is used at an important plot point (as opposed to the meaningless technobabble that often ruined TNG). Kirk calls upon genuine knowledge of basic chemistry to make gunpower with the materials found on the planet. The Gorn captain is much too tough to be hurt otherwise. As a small child, I was really scared by this lizard man.",1187222400,,1647,4.792253521126761
7805199,5,6300213234,"This episode is one of the best of the original series and shows james kirk learning a lesson, having him confront his own predjudice towards an alien lifeform. The final scene where kirk shows mercy towards his alien opponent is a prime example of roddenberry's vision of the future where humanity has overcome their baser frailties.",1176076800,,334,4.982142857142857
7805200,5,6300213234,"When I was a kid, I loved this episode because it features Kirk fighting against a dinosaur-looking alien. As an adult, I can appreciate it even more. Unlike so many Star Trek epsiodes where Kirk is lecturing some other species about justice or equality, here Kirk is taught an important lesson about his own prejudice.
The episode begins with the Enterprise finding a Federation colony under savage attack by an unknown species. Countless men, women, and children -- all civilians -- have been slaughtered. Kirk is enraged and chases the attacking vessel across space. Spock tries to talk some sense into Kirk but he will have none of it. He pushes his vessel past safe limits in an attempt to catch the aliens. When when the two ships travel into space claimed by the Metrons -- an advanced, pacifistic species -- the situation changes considerably.
Realizing that both the Enterprise and the aliens are running on pure adreneline and not thinking things out, the Metrons decide to let the two sides satisfy their thirst for violence through a one-on-one battle between the captain of each starship. Kirk and the captain of the alien ship are transported to the surface of a barren world where they are to engage in hand-to-hand combat to the death. To Kirk's horror, he finds that his opponent is from a species of incredibly strong reptiles named the Gorn. Kirk quickly discovers that he is physically outmatched.
What makes this episode so fascinating is how Kirk changes during the course of the conflict. At the start, he is openly hateful of the Gorn, even going so far to as to admit that he has a natural revulsion towards reptiles. He considers them lower lifeforms. However, he is aware of his prejudice against them and forces himself to remember that his opponent is every much his equal intellectually. Late in the battle, he communicates with the Gorn captain through the universal translator device and discovers that the Gorn attacked the Federation colony because they believed it was an invasion. For the first time, Kirk is able to see the situation from the other side. The Gorn were acting in (perceived) self-defense.
By the time that the battle has finally reached the final confrontation between the two, Kirk has come to the conclusion that he is not qualified to judge the action of this species nor dispense justice.  His surprising resolution of the conflict impresses the Metrons, who have been overseeing the battle.
The ambition of this episode -- airing in the 60s and with a limited budget -- is staggering in retrospect. Shooting a battle between Kirk and a reptile running around in the desert is impressive enough. But the fact that Kirk, the quintessential hero, is able to admit that he may have been wrong is something that is rare even in today's popular TV shows and movies. This episode was well before its time.",1059004800,3,2856,4.840490797546012
7805201,5,6300213234,"Arena or We Morn for the Gorn....
This one is based on a classic SCI fi short story that pits man against monster.  In this case it's Kirk against the Gorn.  He uses gun powder and a makeshift cannon; which by the way I find hard to believe he'd be able to do this in the desert.  If you can forget that it's still nail biter of an episode.  We see Kirk against a foe he can't stop with his fists so he has to blow him off the map.  We see a wispy alien from above who is experimenting with humans to see how they react under the stress of getting killed by a dinosaur creature called the Gorn.  It stands up to the repeated viewing test but I'd have to say you have to suspend your belief in the logic department.",1029628800,,714,3.958041958041958
7805202,5,6300213234,"This episode showed two sides of the story for once. The Enterprise and humans aren't always the good guys. It concerns no one, until the end that the Gorns were invaded and they were merely defending themselves. So nyah nyah nyah!",1019606400,,231,4.658536585365853
7805203,5,6300213234,"This episode begins with what appears to be a low budget version of Balance of Terror. We don't even get to see the Gorn ship, which takes some excitement out of a high-speed chase, which Kirk believes is important to the Federation.
As soon as the Metrons step in, however, the action picks up considerably. Kirk is forced to battle the leader of the Gorns, and the resulting combat is fun, exciting, and suspenseful.
The Gorn is well-done and effective, slow, but too strong for Kirk to overcome using his standard Federation Judo that usually serves him quite well.
The final showdown between Kirk and the Gorn is a classic Star Trek scene that is not to be missed.",989539200,5,668,4.621848739495798
