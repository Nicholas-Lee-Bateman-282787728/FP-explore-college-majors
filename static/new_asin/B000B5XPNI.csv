8113870,1,B000B5XPNI,Very frustrating to watch. Provides only bits of information at a time then cuts to other scenes mid sentence. Leaves you hanging and dependent on looking stuff up online. Get another video series or watch other How to videos online. I give it a one star because I can't give it a lower rating.,1274745600,,294,4.462962962962963
8113871,1,B000B5XPNI,"Very low budget, poorly organized and poorly presented. This DVD is guaranteed to get the novice or weekend Do-it-yourselfer in big trouble! The information it presents is HIGHLY incomplete. It does not present the material in a logical step-by-step manner and essentially what you get is a sound bite. It leaves out too many critical steps to be of any use! And forget about the helpful hints, tips, short cuts and friendly advice. Not here! I recommend the Hometime video series by Dean Johnson or just picking up a Flooring video at any of the large home centers, for a fraction of the price! This DVD should either be thouroughly updated or removed from the market!",1171411200,9,669,4.775862068965517
