8053111,1,B0007X1NWO,"These are great films, but this is a set that is basically pirated from other companies. It is low quality, and a rip off from the people who actually take the time to make good dvds available. You rather need any Buster Keaton release from Kino, as well as the MGM collection. Avoid this!",1291334400,2,289,4.37037037037037
8053112,4,B0007X1NWO,"I disagree with the above review.  However these were made, they are still very watchable and only a fraction of the cost of the Kino set.  The music is very appropriate: lively, happy, and fun.  Though the quality may not be the same,(honestly I have seen them both and the difference is slight with the exception of The Garage)I am very happy with my purchase.  For those of us who cannot afford to purchase the Kino set at almost 200 dollars, this is a great alternative.  After all, some Keaton is better than no Keaton at all.",1284163200,2,531,4.43298969072165
8053113,1,B0007X1NWO,"Let's make this quick -

Several of these shorts are sourced from other vendor's dvds, specifically the ""One Week"" short, which only comes from one source. This may not be illegal, but it sure is a crummy thing to do to those good guys who actually source and restore silent films. Buy the Kino set of Keaton to support that kind of work.

Several of these shorts are from inferior copies. They are also poorly encoded, so the quality suffers even more.

And then there is a watermark in the corner, because, even though these are just copies of other people's productions, heaven forbid somebody copies these versions!! So you get to see a watermark during the entire set. Annoying. It's amazing that companies that have everything to lose when it comes to being copied won't put a watermark on THEIR dvds because they know that quality comes first, but some tinpot garbage vendor is willing to slap his logo all over the place.

Don't bother. There is nothing worthy here. Get a different set from Image or Kino, who actually have done something worthwhile. And get me something to control my blood pressure while you are at it. Remember, I bought this so that you don't have to!!",1138492800,75,1182,4.641148325358851
