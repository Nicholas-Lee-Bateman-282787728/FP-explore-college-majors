8024002,5,B00028G784,"Sofia Alvarez shines as Chabela Vargas, a tough gal who lives on a ranch with her sister Graciella (Nelly Montiel) and tio (Carlos Orellana). Chabela wears the pants in the family and runs the ranch, and is very much ""one of the guys."" An engineer from the big city (Rene Cardona) comes to the ranch to complicate matters of the heart, and both Chabela and Graciella are smitten. He plays on both their affections, leaving Lorenzo (Pedro Infante), who is secretly in love with Chabela, out of the running. Lorenzo is an honest man, and the only one that is macho enough for Chabela, but it takes time (and a big fight!) for Chabela to discover this.

This is very much Alvarez' film, with Infante getting very little screen time, but he makes the most of every minute of it. Sofia Alvarez (1913-1985), the wonderful actress from Colombia who was also paired with Infante in ""Soy Charro de Rancho Grande"" and ""Si Me Han de Matar Manana,"" is terrific in this role, and her enchanting grace and style can be seen even in her masculine stance and dress. Her hands are amazing, and so expressive. Directed by Joaquin Pardave, the Jorge Stahl cinematography is gorgeous, and gives one a feeling of what ""old Mexico"" was like. The audio is somewhat deteriorated, and you'll have to turn up the volume a little more than usual. Manuel Esperon scored the film, and Infante and Alvarez have 3 songs apiece, With the title song getting several renditions. Other songs include ""El Corrido de Chabela Vargas"" and ""Un Resbalon."" No subtitles are available.",1177977600,3,1542,4.732342007434944
