7929551,4,B000051S6P,"Great content. Johnny Miller is insightful and explains key points succinctly. I am trying to put this on my iPad so its there when I need it. Unfortunately, the formatting only allows for it to be to be converted into an hour long video with no chapter breaks which means its hard to go over particular areas as needed. The videos are great, but it should be put into a more accessible format.",1379203200,,394,4.410958904109589
7929552,5,B000051S6P,"This is some of the best golf instruction that I have seen, and I have bought a lot of golf instruction books and videos.",1368662400,,121,4.083333333333333
7929553,5,B000051S6P,Honest approach with tips I saw nowhere else. His credentials are there and his reputation for saying stuff others won't. Worthwhile viewing.,1362182400,,141,5.454545454545454
7929554,3,B000051S6P,The instructions were too fast and assumed the golfer had some experience.  I do and found the DVD's helpful.  My wife is a new golfer and was totally lost by his instructions.,1276041600,,176,4.46875
7929555,4,B000051S6P,Johnny Miller clearly demonstrates his passion for understanding and executing the golf swing. Pretty well produced because it captures his enthusiasm and knowledge depth. The explanations and tips that he provides are easy to take to the course and driving range. The guy is a master at his craft.,1263254400,,298,5.1020408163265305
7929556,4,B000051S6P,"Great videos.  Johnny gives tips in these videos which I have never heard before.  He gives a lot of information which has to be seen a few times to comprehend. The instruction is excellent.  The only thing I would have liked better would have been more camera angles and some better graphics.  Overall, I would highly recommend this dvd.",1256428800,3,338,4.677966101694915
7929557,5,B000051S6P,"I've read and watched a lot of golf instruction and this is some of the best.  I'm a 22 handicapper with a tendency to fade/slice most shots.  After a lifetime of DIY learning I took a lesson from a local pro recently.  He showed me that my posture was poor and I was coming over the top more than I ever imagined I was and got my swing on plane.  This immediately straightened out the ball flight.  Then, watching Johnny's video, I was able to turn the ball over and get a nice draw going on my irons--something I've never done before.  The key is in what he calls ""covering"" the ball with your right hand, or ""palming up"" with your left.  He also points out that something as simple as rushing your tempo is an easy way to fade the ball--the very thing I've been doing all along!  There is enough information here to keep you busy on the practice range for a long time: hitting high, low, hooking and slicing around obstacles.  His style of teaching is very informal; you feel like you're out there on the practice tee with him just shooting the breeze.  He's right when he says that a lot of what he's covering hasn't been covered before.",1249430400,6,1141,4.314553990610329
7929558,5,B000051S6P,"I had previously owned the video of Johnny Miller's Golf Clinic and found  this to be the best around. He makes the process of teaching the method of playing golf at a high standard much easier for the likes of me to understand.
Apart from Ben Hogan's book on The Fundamentals of Golf, this method gives a visual dimension as to what Ben Hogan tried to highlight in book form.
