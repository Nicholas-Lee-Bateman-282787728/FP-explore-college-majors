635466,5,6303394051,"After all this time I'm glad to finally have this wonderful movie on DVD; it was certainly worth the long wait!

John Candy turns in a wonderful performance as Chicago police officer Danny Muldoon, in his late-30s and still living with his mother. He tries to pursue a relationship with a young girl working as a makeup artist in a funeral home, but his feisty Irish mother won't seem to let go. Quite a charming story, with a few jolts coming from Danny's imagined fears of his mother being harmed when he's not there for her. The way Chicago is represented is hit-or-miss, possibly due to licensing issues for some of the more well-known Chicago images (most notably, the Chicago policeman's uniform and the design of the Chicago squad car), but those flaws notwithstanding the movie still has a Chicago feel to it. There actually are still a few remaining store-front funeral homes in Chicago, and of course the plentiful Irish pubs are captured perfectly. Probably the unheralded star of the movie is old Comiskey Park, which for 80 years was the home of the Chicago White Sox. The filming took place after the final baseball game was played there in 1990 (and a few months before its fateful date with the wrecking ball), and the first-date picnic on the playing field was a wonderful and touching sendoff for the old park. After going to many White Sox games there since age 5, it sure was nice to see the fireworks from the scoreboard one last time!",1089676800,3,1456,4.665369649805448
635467,5,6303394051,"I saw the movie on Pax tv, channel 16  here in Salt Lake City and it was very good.  I like Maureen O'hara, she played in Miracle on 34th Street, I have that video.  I am going to order Only the Lonley because it is very moving and entertaining, I thought that it was interesting when Maureen O'Hara ""Tells it like it is"" to John Candy's girl friend and almost ruins their plans for getting married.",1064275200,2,399,4.223684210526316
635468,4,6303394051,"I'd rate this a five star movie in terms of showing John Candy's ability to act rather than simply be funny. It only rates four stars though because the overall movie, while good, isn't exceptional. That being said, the interplay between the Candy character and his mother (Ohara) and potential mate (Sheedy) is well done, allowing Ohara to play the shrew and Candy to play the repressed but dutiful son to the hilt. Though rated a ""4"", don't let that stop you from buying the movie. It's the best dramatic work John Candy ever did which, given how well he plays this role, is the real tragedy of his early death. John Candy at 65 years old playing parts similar to the one Ohara latches onto here would have been really something to see.",1056326400,5,738,4.514925373134329
635469,4,6303394051,"This movie has all the makings of a winner.  A plot that is identifiable to almost any moviegoer, (everybody knows somebody in this situation.)A cast consisting of a fine comic lead, good supporting characters and two Hollywood legends.  And a script that fits each actor like a glove.
John Candy pleases in this low key role of a lonely police officer tied too tight to his mother (O'Hara) who has very strong opinons about almost everything and who plays the mother guilt card like no other as he is pursuing his interest in an equally lonely lady (Sheedy).  I watched this with my own mother who is O'Hara's age and saw her nodding in agreement all over the film. (until her full blooded Siclian fists clenched when O'Hara's character described us.  The look on her face was worth the price of the movie alone.)
The story is plesant and worth your money, Candy & O'Hara work well together (who would have thought she would outlive him!)  but the real power of the film is her interaction with Anthony Quinn.  Classic film buffs like myself will get a real charge out of Quinn once again persuing O'Hara, but this time without an Errol Flynn as a rival.  That sub plot is at least as interesting as the main one and for my money is better.  It is classic Maureen O'Hara, the strong woman who is chased by the strong man and frankly is a great contrast to the the exact opposite situation between Candy & Sheedy.
In the end to nobodys surprise love conquers all and Candy's final immagined scene (contrasting with several ones eariler in the film) gives him closure.  That final scene is my favorite and show O'Hara playing a character she has always excelled at.  Considering the events of 9/11/01 the ending has even more meaning as we see a member of ""The Greatest Generation"" setting an example (albert a fictious one) that would be bravely followed in reality 10 years later.
I've said little about the good performances by Sheedy and Belushi, not to mention several other supporting characters in minor roles, they all add to the picture, but the stars make this film.  Buy it.",1010102400,31,2084,4.62059620596206
635470,4,6303394051,"Is there a movie where John Candy was the main actor that did not make you laugh out loud? This is not an exception to that rule. The man had such subtle wit and could deliver a line in the most hillarious way, God rest his soul.

In this story his mother makes a good candidate for mother-in-lawhood. She is controlling and a bit selfish in that she doesn't see her sons need to have his own life.

Each time John Candy tries to let go he has thoughts that something terrible will happen to his mother. His mother comes across as a completely controlling and insensitive person who we soon learn to dislike. We of course feel completely sorry for her son and hope he finds someone and runs away with her.

As a police officer who knows everyone, he finally takes advantage of his position in very creative ways and meets the woman of his dreams. But can he keep her? Will his mother let him go?

All I want to say is...watch this and enjoy it. If I tell you the whole story, it will spoil it for you.

If you don't laugh out loud when you watch this movie, come back and give me 10 negatives...I am that confident you will enjoy this movie. It is a bit long in some places, but the laughs are completely worth it.

Maureen O'Hara's character (as Candy's mother) displays familiar temperament as a feisty character that develops her heart in the end.

John Candy and Maureen O'Hara do a great job as you would expect of portraying a codependent mother and son who need to untangle the apron strings holding both of them back.

I can't imagine anyone worth knowing who won't enjoy this movie.  It isn't as contrived as UNCLE BUCK and it's just as funny.  Wouldn't John Candy have been a wonderful friend IRL? I think so, anyway.  Such a loss.",1424131200,,613,4.611111111111111

636143,5,6303394051,"It's a puzzle to me that whenever I see a piece about John Candy on the news, or some other program, recalling his life or this or that, they never seem to mention ONLY THE LONELY, which I maintain is his best film. I don't watch all that many romantic comedies, but the ones I do watch and enjoy are usually about ""misfits"" of some sort or another - i.e., MARTY,  BENNY AND JOON,  UNTAMED HEART, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL (another John Hughes film) and so on, and ONLY certainly falls in that category. John Candy's given the spotlight here, in a dramatic/comedic role that may have been too radically different from his other work, and perhaps that explains the seemingly indifference of the media regarding this film.

The story line is classic, unmarried brother still living at home with Mom as she reaches retirement age and feels trapped between starting his own family and taking care of his Mom. The cast is stellar and all of them are perfect for the roles they play. Why this is not out on Blu-Ray is a mystery.

He wins her heart and all is well until they run into the obstacle of Dannys domineering Irish mother Rose Muldoon (Mauren OHara).  Everyone warms him to the routine of marriage and his best friend played by Jim Belushi tries to sway him away.
All the while Nick Acropolis (Anthony Quinn) is pining for Roses heart as the nosy next door greek neighbor.
A beautiful story with a message of the challenges of love and living happily ever after.  I watched it late night on HBO and was marveled on such a good story.  John Candy was such a versatile artist. RIP.",1404691200,,815,4.413333333333333

636360,5,6303394051,"The best film John Candy ever headlined!  A shy, intelligent, lonely Chicago cop longs to escape his overbearing Irish mother's grasp and discover all life has to offer:  romance, love, passion, independence, and adventure.  When Danny(Candy) meets Teresa(Sheedy) an aspiring make-up artist stifled by her own phobias, working in her father funeral home with no one for company except the deceased, he sees a truly kindred spirit whose fire lies just below the surface.  Together the two embark on a sweet, endearing, and rocky path to love complete with disapproving relatives.

How I love it when Danny stands up to his domineering mother (albeit still respectfully but not without truth and pulling no punches)!  This film reminds me so much of Marty (starring Ernest Borgnine).  One can't help but feel that Colombus must have channeled Paddy Chafesky.

A timeless film with a poignant message!  If you have not seen this one, do yourself a favor and purchase for your collection!  It is that fabulous!

I still miss Candy; he is irreplaceable and such a class act!  He would have doubtless gone on to even greater things...  Can't help but smile when I watch one of his films, especially this one!",1398902400,2,1202,4.95
636361,5,6303394051,"John Candy made a lot of movies, some good and a lot of them mediocre. This whimsical 1989 romantic comedy, filmed in Chicago rather than some stand-in city, has a lot of panache and flavor in addition to a great cast. Candy is a Chicago cop who still lives with his overbearing Irish Catholic mother. For anyone who has mother issues, it's a hilarious comedic romp as Candy tries to break away and date a Sicilian mortician played by Ally Sheedy. What makes this material stand out from the usual formula comedy is the brilliant presence of frequent John Wayne collaborator Maureen O'Hara, who came out of retirement for this role as the mother. Her interactions with Candy are hysterical. Good supporting work comes from Jim Belushi as Candy's police wagon partner, Kevin Pollack as his brother, Macauley Culkin in a blink-and-you-miss-it early role as his nephew, and Anthony Quinn as a Greek widower with designs on O'Hara. Add a first-rate director (Chris Columbus of ""Harry Potter"") and you've got a sentimental and sweet film that may well be the best overall film in Candy's brief career.",1398211200,,1096,4.866310160427807

636564,5,6303394051,"We all know of John as a great comedic actor. I've seen all of his movies, and really loved his work on SCTV. I first saw this movie in the late 90's. Since then I've looked for it but it has been out of print. It was recently rereleased on DVD. First I'd say this movie is hard to catagorizie, In my opinion. It's not a comedy, but it is funny. No gags or slapstick. I don't want to call it a ""romantic comedy"", for fear of labeling it a ""chick movie"".  In a small way, it sorta' is, but not really. You guys will like it too. I see it as a pretty accurate play on the relationships between the characters.

And what a great cast it is, John Candy, Maureen O'Hara (in her 1st acting roll after 20 years of retirement), Anthony Quinn, Ally Sheedy, Jim Belushi. Written and directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone). At the heart of it is John Candy as a single 30 something Chicago cop who lives with and takes care of his overbearing, opinionated, cold Mother (Maureen O'Hara) who won't agree on anything, includind the color of the sky. Then John (Danny Muldoon) falls in love. I'll leave it at that. It is really good movie with a great cast and a lot of familiar character actors.

Who would have thought these five would star together in a romantic comedy?  I will not attempt to repeat the plot of this movie as other reviewers have already done this service for us.  I will say that this movie is another one of those lost gems that few realize exists.  I remember seeing it on cable some years ago and was struck by how well it entertained me.  It is a great movie for its genre and should at least be rented for viewing if not purchased.  O'Hara gives a wonderfully entertaining performance.  Another reviewer stated that she stole the show.  She just about would have if not for the performances of many of the supporting actors.  She is indeed a Hollywood icon of a golden age that has passed.  Many of the aforementioned supporting roles are played by veteran actors whose faces you will recognize, but unfortunately their names have escaped us.

636615,3,6303394051,"In Only the Lonely, Danny Muldoon (played by John Candy) is a single Chicago cop with Catholic guilt, a racist mother, and about a million friends.  When he meets Theresa Luna (played by Ally Sheedy), who applies cosmetics to the newly departed at the family's funeral home, viewers get to watch this relationship develop.  However, when Danny's mother, Rose (played by Maureen O'Hara), finds out that Theresa is both Polish AND Italian, sparks fly.

This is not a slapstick comedy film, as you might expect with John Candy.  It's a more serious film about loneliness, guilt, stereotypes, racism, and love.  A side vignette is the romantic pursuit of Rose by her Greek neighbor, Nick Acropolis (played well by Anthony Quinn).

It's a film in the general style of boy meets girl, they fall in love after a number of stumbles, something happens and they break up, one or the other rethinks their life and goals, and they get back together.  Is this just the human condition, or what we find entertaining?

One thing I didn't like about the movie was that Theresa Luna (Ally Sheedy), so cute and vulnerable at the beginning of the film, got much less loveable as the movie progressed.

A repeated line throughout the movie was ""Sometimes it's good to be a cop.""  It worked well!",1291334400,,1275,4.754545454545455

636620,5,6303394051,"I own very few DVDs and this is one of them. An excellent outing for John Hughes and Christopher Columbus (Home Alone among most recognized for these Chicagoans), this is an outstanding multi-ethnic, multi-generational romantic comedy which - yes - does everything at its level best to amplify perceived stereotypes of Italians, Greeks, Irish, Polish, WASP and tie to various areas of Chicagoland. The humor is both delicate and raucous in various scenes, certainly in consideration of Jim Belushi as John Candy's cop partner on 'stiff duty'. Maureen O'Hara and Anthony Quinn are hilarious in their stereotypical roles - which, as the only potential slight, can sometimes seem very contrived in performance. Ally Sheedy plays Candy's love interest as an introverted mortuary assistant. The varied scene shots around Chicago are great. As a final note on the actors, John Candy is at his best - a real tribute to his comic and reasonable acting legacy (though Planes, Trains and Automobiles takes the cake).

Great story, situational writing and script. The real message with this quaint and sometimes hysterical romantic comedy is that love conquers all - particularly across generations. Make sure to see this hidden gem among films.",1247788800,,1234,5.232323232323233
636621,5,6303394051,"Danny Muldoon, a 38 year-old Chicago policeman, still lives with his widowed mother. An unhealthy codependency exists between them. She still does his laundry and makes his meals. She makes intrusive comments and directives about his relationships with women, even openly demeaning his new girlfriend Teresa. For his part, he is extremely protective of his mother. Even when on dates, he has visions of disaster overtaking his mother, and feels compelled to interrupt the date, and make a phone call home to see if his mother is all right. This does not exactly help his growing relationship with Teresa.

This rocky comedy has numerous hilarious scenes. There is the lowering of a corpse out the window, using a fire hose to do so. In another scene, Danny Muldoon uses a snorkel to be lifted up to the window of his girlfriend Teresa. At still another time, Danny uses his police siren to fake an emergency to reach his departing, estranged Teresa.

Will Danny ever fully outgrow his relationship with his mother, and become fully available to Teresa? Will she recognize any such outgrowing and give him another chance?",1243123200,,1120,4.952127659574468
636681,4,6303394051,"Roles like this helped make big John Candy somewhat of a beloved figure in his time. He was good at playing big, lovable oafs that usually messed up but had a good heart.

Many times, as in here, he might appear jovial on the outside but inside he was a very lonely guy, hence the title. I'll bet a number of viewers could identify with him. In this film he plays ""Danny Muldoon.""

Ally Sheedy's character, ""Theresa Luna,"" is sweet in the beginning but then becomes unfairly-demanding and annoying by the end. Maureen O'Hara did a fine job playing ""Danny's"" domineering mother, ""Rose."" She came out of retirement to do this film and did herself proud. Anthony Quinn's role, meanwhile, was stupid.

This movie is billed as a comedy but I didn't find a lot of laughs in it. It's really more of a sentimental drama, and it works on that level. I always enjoy seeing comedians do drama, because they are so good at doing it. I'm sorry Candy didn't make a few more dramatic roles.",1238457600,,975,4.497175141242938

This is one of my many favorites of his movies, to top it off we have Mareen O'Hara with all her spunk and class.
The movie is a cute classic comedy, one of chris colombus's films I believe, I love his films like dennis the mennis and such. Did he do Home Alone? I'll have to check but I believe so, anyways Id say it wouldn't hurt to get this one, try it, if you don't like it then aliens do exist.  ^^
It has all of what I like in good movies.
It has comedy, it has romance, it has some action, it has guilt, allot of guilt, it has paranoia, it has phyco mothers, it has a guy with a very active imagination and can think of all the most worst possible things that could happen to his ""sweet"" mother.

The movie is funny despite some ethnic slurs and O'Hara steals the movie. Upon her return to Tinseltown after the death of her husband, she was asked to play Rose Muldoon. She took one look at Candy and said ""OK, I'll play his mother"".

Another icon Anthony Quinn plays the lovelorn neighbor. His scenes with O'Hara are classic. Two tremendous pros giving lessons in acting and their  chemistry is perfect.

Candy and Ally Sheedy are newcomers compared to O'Hara and Quinn and this  humorous and entertaining movie gives them the chance to work with two of  filmdom's greats and both are wonderful in their roles.

But this is O'Hara's movie. She never resorts to stereotype and her strong finish only reaffirms the statement ""welcome back Ms. O'Hara"".

There were certain facts and circumstances here that challenge our ability to suspend our disbelief such as Candy, a Chicago policeman, being ""transferred"" to a job in Florida and also his tremendous obesity at that point in his life made the attraction between he and Sheedy a bit suspect. But John Candy was a tremendous joy in practically everything he ever did. His acting was always good and he portrayed the mother-dominated Danny Muldoon with aplomb. In fact, the acting overall, with Maureen O'Hara excelling in her role and Anthony Quinn adding a certain something to the endeavor, was another reason for why the film succeeds. As far as the romance was concerned I found it a little too manufactured, but tastes do differ in this regard.",1184976000,,802,4.904411764705882

Neither character has much to offer...other than themselves...and that turns out to be enough.  Throw in an intrusive mother for a little humor, and this movie has it all.  Highly recommended.

636725,5,6303394051,"In John Candy's short but prolific film career he made few films that were up to his prodigious talents.  This is the best of the bunch.  There is no debating that Candy was up to the light-hearted comedy demanded of him in his role as affable Chicago cop Danny Muldoon.  Candy was also more than capable of delivering on the dramatic elements in this story of a 38 year-old man finding love for the first time.  Credit that to the capable direction of Chris Columbus and his knowing script.  Candy also gets to play with some first class pros and I think that upped his game.  Maureen O'Hara lost none of her star appeal in her golden years as Danny's demanding mother.  This role could have been played as a stereotype but O'Hara injects complexity and, yes, sympathy for her character.  Ally Sheedy may also have had the best role of her career as Theresa, the introverted funeral home cosmetologist who is the object of Danny's affection.  Anthony Quinn also delivers an amusing turn as Danny's neighbor who burns the torch for his mother.  This film is an unqualified heartwarming success.",1119139200,42,1094,4.680628272251309
636726,4,6303394051,"""Only the Lonely"" is actually a very interesting film, featuring on a procession of lonely people. As much as the Roy Orbison title song sums up the plot, so would ""Eleanor Rigby"" ... ""All the lonely people, where do they all come from? All the lonely people, where do they all belong?""

In addition to John Candy's Danny and Ally Sheedy's Theresa, there are more lonely people - Danny's mother Rose, trapped in an isolation of her own making, played to a tee by Maureen O'Hara in a great performance. Anthony Quinn, as Nick, would love to rescue her, but she is too stubborn and obstinate to let him in. In reinforcing her own loneliness, Rose is also condemning Danny to his own isolation, as well as Nick.

Through Candy's terrific performance (by far, the best of his all-too-short career), we find out that Danny is actually a very good guy - a hard worker who himself sacrificed so his younger brother could go to law school, a dutiful son who, even 25 years later, still feels regrets over his father's inabilities to make it big in business. In short, a big lug who would be a great catch for a girl like Teresa.

Ally Sheedy also does a fine job with Teresa. I have read reviews describing this character as ""muted,"" ""inconspicuous"" and ""apologetic,"" which I think totally miss the point, which is actually explained in a scene early in the movie.

Teresa simply is a very shy person, lacking in self-confidence and aggressiveness. It's not only being shy - she has a real emotional problem with it. She sometimes retreats into a shell and as a result sometimes is out of the center of the action. She has gravitated into a career that reinforces this isolation.

I think Sheedy actually nailed this character trait very well. She's pretty, neither drop-dead gorgeous nor an ugly duckling. Another nice-looking girl of whom you know somebody could say, ""You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're all right...""

We learn a little more about her dreams and aspirations and of course we realize she and Danny are perfect for each other, if only they can figure it out and find their way around Rose.

In very brief bit parts, we see, as part of the crowd of regulars at the Irish pub Danny and Rose frequent, three middle-aged (LATE-middle-aged) confirmed bachelors, bar-hounds, kind of Cliff-Claven-plus-20-years type characters -- full of wisecracks, jokes, Irish drinking songs -- but also alone, so much so when one of them dies, there's virtually nobody to even come to his funeral.

These are obviously cautionary tales to Danny - the Ghosts of his Christmases Yet To Come. A look at what his life will be in 25 years when Rose is gone, and he has no one left.

At the end, of course, love does conquer all, and we wouldn't want it any other way. Teresa gets the guts to go after Danny, Nick gets the guts to go after Rose, Danny gets the guts to cut loose of Rose, and Rose finally gets the guts to not only let him do it, but to tell him to.

Sure, it's mushy and predictable. But it makes the heartache a little more bearable. Absolutely a must movie for DVD someday, so get with it!",1100131200,7,3092,4.544964028776978
