8609643,5,B000HE8CSG,"I have had the great fortune to watch these lessons and work with the Maestri Martinez in person. Their interpretation of the Spanish system of fencing is unparalleled because it incorporates the martial knowledge of previous Spanish fencing masters as well as the personal martial knowledge of the Maestri accumulated over a lifetime. The instruction received here is organized in the Maestris unique pedagogical approach to learning Spanish rapier. The DVD lessons serve as a supporting study material for those unable to train with a master practitioner of Spanish Rapier. However, the instruction here should not be confused for an all encompasing manual that is entirely inclusive of all the nuances of Spanish Rapier as a martial form. It is not a how-to guide, but rather a well organized sequence of lessons designed to facilitate ones personal journey into the martial form of the Spanish Rapier. In that sense, it is absolutely invaluable. I highly recommend that anyone who seriously wishes to study and practice the Spanish School of Rapier obtain this DVD.",1531612800,,1069,5.184971098265896
8609644,5,B000HE8CSG,I've been a student of fencing for over 8 years. Specifically Spanish for 6 years.  I found that this is an excellent video that walks a new student through the basics of Destreza. Everything done in the video is explained and demonstrated well. I would recommend this to anyone who is seriously wanting to learn more about Spanish fencing and the art of defense.,1530835200,,363,4.671875
8609645,5,B000HE8CSG,"These DVDs are a great source of information for those looking to learn more about the Spanish school of fencing. While no one can learn a martial art by simply reading a book (old or new) or by watching a DVD, this is a fantastic addition to anyone's collection of study materials and offers those without access to a qualified teacher the chance to begin their journey.

Based on many years of rigorous research by Maestro Ramon Martinez, the steward of a living martial arts tradition, he has put his unique combination of knowledge of the fencing arts and his fluency of various Spanish dialects on display. Given this, he remains the single most qualified person to offer an interpretation on La Verdadera Destreza and does so eloquently in this series.",1530835200,3,758,4.786259541984733
8609646,5,B000HE8CSG,This collection of instructional DVDs are in my opinion the best source for studying the Spanish School of Rapier available on the market.,1528588800,6,138,5.043478260869565
8609647,5,B000HE8CSG,"With this work Maestro Martinez has done a great service to the practice of historical fencing by enabling both the adept and the new initiate to enrich themselves with the wealth of the fascinating tradition of La Verdadera Destreza.

Others can more eloquently express the technical masterwork made possible by the unbroken line of instruction stretching back several centuries. For myself, I can say I found the integrity and thoroughness of this system of instruction to be intensely inspiring and perilously beautiful.",1528502400,8,523,5.378048780487805
8609648,5,B000HE8CSG,"I have studied fencing for fifteen years and have take taken classes with other instructors (including Maestro Curtis). Based on that experience, it is my opinion that the Destreza taught by Maestro Martinez is the most comprehensive and well-informed interpretation of any being taught today. This video, while a bit dated, is still an excellent survey of the Art for someone new to Destreza. No video can replace live instruction, but this does all that can be expected of an instructional DVD. You will not ""learn to fence"" from it, but you will get a solid introduction to some of the main principles and techniques specific to Spanish fencing. If you are curious about Destreza and are looking for solid and serious information from a Maestro who is classically-trained, a native Spanish speaker, and who has been fencing -- and, indeed, a Master at Arms -- for longer than many of us have been alive... then I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough. It is well worth the money.

Full disclosure: I have taken many classes from the Maestros Martinez and have chosen to study at a school associated with them. I do not, however speak for my school or for them.
Also full disclosure: At least one single-star review of this video is from a newer fencing master who has a history of public hostility to the Martinez Academy. The fencing world is full of adolescent posturing and I encourage you to take both superlatives and vitriol with grains of salt. Sigh.",1528502400,9,1462,4.778656126482214
8609649,1,B000HE8CSG,"I am a board-certified fencing master, a researcher of the Spanish tradition, and I run a school which teaches the work based on the earlier authors of La Verdadera Destreza with an emphasis on Carranza, Pacheco, Figueiredo, and Ettenhard.

The first thing you should know about these DVDs is that on his website Ramon Martinez claims to be the ""world's preeminent authority"" for this tradition.  If you have experience in martial arts, this should be a warning sign.  Anyone making extraordinary claims deserves extra scrutiny and skepticism.

The DVDs are advertised as presenting the swordplay tradition practiced by Carranza, Pacheco, Rada and other historical masters of the Spanish True School, La Verdadera Destreza.  The problem is that the target audience of these DVDs are English-speakers and these newcomers to the tradition have no meaningful way to verify the academic integrity of the presentation and the fencing actions performed in the videos against the actual source texts.

The assertions Martinez makes of expertise and authority suggest that the viewer is going to be presented an authentic representation of the art but as he presents the material the edifice begins to crumble.  What is presented appears to be primarily classical French with a bit of Spanish window dressing.  To be fair, in the video at one point he describes it as his ""own didactical method"" but he doesn't make it clear when his method deviates from the historical sources and the deviations are significant and important.

If I sell you a chicken sandwich made from frog meat, the frog meat might still be delicious but that doesn't make it chicken.  In the same way, classical French fencing can be very effective; the problem is that you should not sell it as Spanish True school to the unwary.  Misrepresentation matters.

You should not take my statements on faith; talk is cheap, and evidence is not.

I will present a selection of specific examples with citations from the historical sources for consideration:

*****************************************************
1. The meaning of Atajo has been altered to make it a synonym for engagement.  Atajo is called ""Atajo The Engagement"" in the video's opening atajo plate.. The problem with that assertion is that engagement in the True School is called Agregacin and its very different from Atajo.

Pacheco in New Science p. 365 (1632)
Atajo, according to our definition, is when one of the weapons is placed over the other (not in any of its extremes nor with any of its extremes) and with equal or some degree more of strength subjects it and makes it so that the technique that can be formed must be done with more movements and the participation of more angles than those that its simple nature requires.

The Defining Elements of Atajo:
Subjection with equal or greater degrees of strength.
The subjection is placed from above.
The subjected line is closed so that an adversary cannot strike with a single movement.
Do not participate in extremes

2. The atajos deviate the opposing weapon using horizontal (or lateral) opposition.  Quoting the video, Coming back, again, to the first position, I'm going to make the atajo to the inside.  So, I'm merely moving my hand to the side, getting the weak part of her blade, and moving her point away from me, again, my point is in line with the perforation of her guard and just under the rim of the cup of her guard.

The problem here is that atajo is downward subjection (called Natural movement) and not lateral displacement of the opposing weapon as you can see in the citation of Pacheco above.

Ettenhard in his Compendium and Foundations p. 154-155 (1675)
I am very safely confident that one will have recognized with enough satisfaction that the Atajo causes its effects by means of a superior graduation and of the superior power of the Natural Movement and also that one will concede to me that if it were possible to beat and destroy these two causes, we would see dispelled the end of such superior effects

3. The atajos do not close the line of attack preferring to keep the point in presence.  In the Martinez quote above you can see that he keeps his point in presence for the atajos.  By observation you can see that the adversary can strike in a straight line to the target.  Again, you can see that this contradicts Pachecos guidance from New Science.

4. The position of right angle posture has been altered such that the hand position is either fingernails up or fingernails down.

Carranzas Description of the Position of the Sword Arm from The Philosophy of Arms p. 155-156 (1569, pub. 1582):
And the best of all these positions is as the arm originates because in it the nerves are more relaxed and the action of the Muscleswhich are (as it is said) the instruments of the voluntary movementquicker. In this position the strength endures longer, and since it is the middle (according to necessity) one passes easily to the extremes. For these reasons and others that come from these, the position on Edge is stronger and better than the one with fingernails down or up. Between the extremes there is advantage, like in those extremes that the virtues have (as we will mention in its place), because the extreme that the Fingernails Up arm makes is not as strong as the position of Fingernails Down. Thus, of the two, Fingernails Down is the most noble because it strains the Nerves less to maintain the strength, because even though the arm does not move (seemingly) the Muscles are working inside that maintain it in that position.

Specifically, the correct grip is fingernails facing the inside line like an Italian third.  In that hand position you can rapidly present your true edge to either the inside or outside line as needed.  The hand positions Martinez advocates mean that half of his atajos are taken with the false edge and the deviation of opposing steel is always lateral.
*****************************************************

In these DVDs Martinez states in volume 2, ""This drill is similar to what I did before except that we're both in Atajo to the inside.""  That statement is extremely problematic and revealing to anyone who knows the tradition.  It betrays a fundamental ignorance of a core defensive action of the True School that functions in an analogous way to finding-the-sword in the Italian school.  (It would be equally troubling to hear someone claiming to be the preeminent authority on Italian fencing say, ""We have both found each other's swords on the inside line."")

There is nothing wrong with creating a hybrid of classical French with Spanish True school; that could be brilliant and exceptional.  The tradition has long history of experimentation, variation, and even conflict between schools.  However, if you change the meaning of fundamental True School actions like the atajo without making your alterations clear you spread misinformation that others will need to correct afterward.

The continued sale of these DVDs creates a cycle of reinforced ignorance that propagates misinformation in the tradition over the course of decades as new fencers view his videos.  If these DVDs were not being sold today as authentic Destreza by the ""world's preeminent authority"" there would be no need to publicly refute the work.  Sadly, that is not the case and if the tradition is to flourish we must try to provide new fencers with a warning that this material is not accurate.

If you think a classical French School style with Destreza flavor sounds interesting, you should buy these DVDs but be aware that the original meanings of the tradition's jargon have been radically changed without warning.  If you want an authentic presentation of the style practiced by Carranza, Pacheco, Ettenhard, or Rada you should look elsewhere.",1528416000,21,7793,4.971494607087828
8609650,5,B000HE8CSG,"There is a growing interest in western martial arts and there are many fascinating manuals published in the Renaissance to use as source material, but it takes more than reading text hundreds of years old written in a manner of speech very different that what is used in literature today. A good understanding of swordsmanship from an experienced Maestro is a must. Maestro Ramon Martinez does a fantastic job of distilling and presenting the core fundamentals of the often misunderstood Spanish system.
Many rapier fencing enthusiasts have dismissed Destreza as a overly complicated and mysterious novelty in Renaissance swordsmanship, however it is well known that the Spanish were very successful duelists and feared throughout Europe in their time, what they were practicing made them the deadliest of adversaries. in these DVD's Maestro Ramon Martinez lifts the fog of mystery and shows a martial art rooted in sound logic and geometry and built on diligent and thoughtful practice. Maestro Ramon Martinez seems to teach information from such masters as Carranza, Pacheco, and Thibault. fundamentals are taught in short, simple, easy to grasp lessons With the help of Maestra Jeannetta Acosta Martinez, and legendary martial artist Anthony De Longis.
Spanish Rapier fencing information can be hard to come by and there aren't many instructors out there teaching this fascinating martial art. The best sources of information that I know of, if you don't have access to a Destreza teacher are these DVD's and the exceptional information put out on the web by Maestro Puck Curtis. I would enthusiastically recommend these DVD's for anyone interested in Renaissance fencing.",1331856000,14,1675,5.324528301886793
