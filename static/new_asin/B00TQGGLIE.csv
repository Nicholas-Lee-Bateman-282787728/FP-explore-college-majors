7020241,5,B00TQGGLIE,"These Final Hours is an excellent movie. It is not a sci-fi flick, as there are virtually no explosive or high tech special effects. It is a character study about one man's redemption. The movie is well-shot and extremely well-acted. The story, a man's behavior just prior to the end of the world, is similar to On the Beach, and also reminds one of Seeking A Friend for the End of the World. It has its gory moments and there is some nudity and coarse language. So it is not for the very young. But adults will enjoy this well done, if unavoidably depressing motion picture.",1515888000,2,575,4.433962264150943

7020248,3,B00TQGGLIE,"Spoilers**........Not much going on here.  Vague references about the end of the world, the how and why of it never really discussed in any detail.  Some people are going nuts in the face of their impending death (within 12 hours).  Mayhem abounds.  A guy takes a young girl into his care, drives around looking for members of his family, visits an end-of-the-world party (everyone dancing, screwing, being crazy).  He finally reunites with his pregnant gal and together they fry on their favorite beach.
Nothing even remotely original here.  Just a shell of a film that had potential.  See On The Beach, made in the 1960s, for a really taut apocalyptic thriller (that ends up in Australia too).",1492041600,,695,4.888888888888889

7020250,4,B00TQGGLIE,"The end of the World is nigh and the people of Perth have been told they have a mere 12 hours to sort out their affairs. James is a bit self absorbed and has had a life mainly dealing with his own wants  though he is not a bad person. But as destruction approaches he is told of the party to end all parties and so heads off across a town where all semblance of law and order has broken down to get his rocks off.

Along the way he comes across a seven year old girl, Rose, who has been split up from her father and, reluctantly, he decides to help her. The path to the reunification with her father takes him on his own path to find what truly matters to himself.

Now this is a film with a simple plot but it is cram full of things that make it stand far out from the crowd. The acting is superb and Rose played by Angourie Rice is excellent and so are all the supporting crew. The cinematography is subtle but brilliant and the special effects are completely believable. The real strength is the story and the underlying emotions that are rumbling along like the clouds of destruction that act like an urban soundtrack as the film nears its conclusion. This is a film you will remember you will talk about and may even want to see again  it is that good  highly recommended.",1488931200,,1277,4.17479674796748

Only thing I didn't like was the yellow filters used. I thought the yellow filters took away rather than added to the mood of the movie.

7020263,3,B00TQGGLIE,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'These Final Hours.'

This is a decent end of the world movie but not great. I prefer post-apocalyptic movies as opposed to pre-apocalyptic or 'happening now' apocalyptic movies.

While there are a lot of good reviews here and many people seem to think that the characters behave in a believable way, I tend to disagree. While a lot of the people would probably do what many of these people do,

***Spolers Ahead***

 I felt the main character's behavior was unrealistic. Would he really leave his pregnant girl friend alone to go to a party? Wouldn't she go with him?. I doubt very much the little girl would want to be left alone at the end.
In a way this reminded me of 'On the Beach.' Almost nobody had any interest in attempting to save themselves. I find this unbelievable. Though one person does build a fallout shelter. Would mankind really just give up? Wouldn't they launch a space station? Dig hundred of miles down to allow a few survivors to continue? The movie doesn't really elaborate on how much notice they had.
Also, I don't like movies that end with no hope whatsoever.
Of the more believable moments were the two 'rednecks' trying to rape a little girl and a crazy drug party.
This movie also had similarities to other 'end of the world' movies such as 'Deep Impact' and 'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.'

***End of Spoilers***

I do applaud the independent company for making this movie. Even if I didn't love the subject matter I still enjoy the process of watching the movie. I doubt I will watch it again though.

7020268,4,B00TQGGLIE,"I saw the movie a couple of years ago on NetFlix and couldn't forget it. I take that as a sign I need it in my collection. I don't know if it's exactly off-the-wall, but the premise is a country who knows their world is ending within a short period of time and it explores (briefly) the varied reactions to it from insane to giving it up, following a young man who leaves his girlfriend and wanders around getting into various situations.

I'm being deliberately vague because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I tend to put myself in the situation and I don't know that I'd have been able to do what he did, particularly with the little girl. I like that he was a decent person even if it wasn't always easy for him to do that.

I watch movies all the time. For me to hang on to one that is obviously not mainstream nor remotely blockbuster says more about the film than it does me. Well worth the time.  Give it a try.",1460246400,,923,4.145251396648045

7020270,4,B00TQGGLIE,"Possible spoilers.  This Australian film never made it to the U. S. except for a film festival in Chattanooga.  Too bad.  Written and directed by Zak Hilditch, the film is yet another take on an end-of-the-world scenario of which Australia seems to be perfect for.  This time around, the end isn't coming because of nuclear annihilation but due to an impending collision with an asteroid.  Set in the far western city of Perth, it will become one of the last populated areas to feel the cataclysmic fireballs effects.  The film makes it clear, there is no hope as the impact is felt first in the North Atlantic, wiping out Europe, North America and moving southwest.  With about 12 hours left, the city is awash with fear and doom.

Nathan Phillips (Chernobyl Diaries) plays James who along with his girlfriend Zoe (Jessica De Gouw) engage in a final act of intimacy before James departs for a party some miles away.  Zoe is left alone.  Shes pissed and so are we.  She wants to ride out her final hours with James.  He wants to spend it drunk, stoned and having a good time.

En route James car is jacked.  He is about to steal a van owned by 2 men who are carrying a 11 or 12 year old girl into their house.  About to leave in the van, he hears the girls screams and in spite of his party plans, he decides to intervene.  One of the men is huge but a large claw hammer is a good equalizer.  The girls name is Rose (terrific performance by Angourie Rice) who is trying to get back to her father.  They were on their way to the family home when they ran out of gas.  Rose was evidently kidnapped by the 2 perverts.  James hopes to drop Rose off somewhere on the way to party time.  He decides his sisters place would be good.  She has 3 daughters near Roses age.  Upon arrival, James finds that his sister didn't wait for the firestorm to end it all.  He decides Rose will just have to come along to the party.

In what is a very uncomfortably long section of the film, James and Rose walk in among a giant, drunken orgy of people in varying degrees of undress doing varying degrees of drugs and engaging in varying degrees of debauchery.  James even leaves Rose to defend for herself while he hooks up with his girlfriend-on-the-side, Vicky (Kathryn Beck).  She just wants to have sex, but James feeling the old guilt trip decides Rose needs him more.  He finds Rose has popped a hallucinogen (really Rose?) given to her by a crazed woman (Sarah Snook, so good in Predestination).  With no other alternative, James heads to his estranged mothers house to care for Rose before driving her to her family home and reunite with her dad for the final hours.

The story hops around a bit too much, relying on the fact that James is pretty high through much of the film, to make his decisions plausible.  But Phillipss performance is noteworthy, especially in the endearing scenes with young Ms. Rice.  As James finally decides to do the right thing, his long wave goodbye to Rose proves Phillips has some real acting talent that hopefully will get recognized.  Aside from the choppiness of the middle section of the film and occasional dialog fluff, the movie is hard to resist.  The special effects are inconsistent as well.  Scenes shot in the car are clearly faked, easily seen even without Blu ray.  But the final wall of fire is spectacular, raging across the ocean toward land.  Recommended.",1459728000,2,3392,4.501639344262295

7020272,5,B00TQGGLIE,"Really, really loved this film! If end of the world movies where the world actually ends are not your forte you won't like this. If you love a good end of the world movie this one is even better than 4:44 Last Day on Earth. Well written, even better cast.",1457654400,,255,4.12
7020273,4,B00TQGGLIE,"This is a thriller mixed around the emotional reality of a drama. Your main character James who is trying to live his last day, at a party, but ends up running into a girl, kidnapped and about to be raped, by two men. You see there is only 12 hours left until the end. A meteor has hit earth. A massive global fire is spreading across the world and will hit Australia in 12 hours. James wants to live his hours partying, but everything changes as this young man, mainly self-obsessed, comes in contact with his emotional side and slowly, the girl becomes his redemption. This is a film that is beautifully acted. Nathan Phillips does an amazing job as James. Nathan Phillips is a stunning and extraordinary actor that I have been following and his career since 1999, playing in the TV series Neighbours, that kind of sounds like I am stalker. In reality, it is his acting that sticks with me. He makes you remember his performances. He has such a unique persona, in his vast array of characters and acting experience. From TV to feature films, he owns his parts and is able to build on the atmosphere of the plots taking place. I loved him as the character of James in These Final Hours. He gave the part depth and the coming ordeal. Something I absolutely loved Nathan Phillips in was the short lived character of Jack Dobbs in the awesome, American version of the series, The Bridge. Like all his parts, he breathes life into the character of James.

Now to be honest going into this I had the mindset as follows: Like zombie films, something that is overdone, over created and displayed annoyingly, is the end of the world plot and scenarios. Going into this, it already had one strike against it, because the end of the world in a feature film, has been overdone countless times. Interestingly, I found myself with my foot in my mouth, and enjoying this film greatly. I ended up experiencing something different, something unique, and it has an originality. I didn't know what to think at first, because like I said, I went into it thinking, oh here we go again, another end of the world film, but, what this one does, is actually ads, stunning performances, alongside a believable plot, that plays with the viewer. The film gives a setting of adrenaline and also the ultimate conclusion of what is taking place. It kind of lets you experience an intense ordeal. That intensity is mixed with an emotional baggage, that you the viewer takes a hold of, as it allows you to become a part of the film.

This is written and directed by Zak Hilditch. Hilditch took a tired, un-original plot and gave life back to it. He was able to hold your attention and make you become a part of the horror, and dread, and tension taking place. He was able to get away from the idea of, its already been done, mentality, and add a little freshness, to the tired reality, of the end of the world plot.

Now what really needs to be said is the acting, by new comer, and I am utterly floored at the brilliance of this young actress, Angourie Rice. Rice plays the part of Rose, the little girl James saves, and she is mind blowing. What perfection in her part. This is her first feature length film. I cannot express enough about her part. She literally comes to life and creates realism through an emotional plight that sticks deep within you, as you watch.

This unique and amazing film was selected to play at the, 2014s Cannes Film Festival. Its a film I highly recommend. Different and unique and emotionally fresh. These Final Hours is able to breathe life into a plot thats been dead for years. These Final Hours is flawlessly acted, tight direction, emotionally charged viewing experience. Loved this movie, loved this Blu-ray.
These Final Hours is truly a believable, emotional drama that the viewer, cant help but feel.

Audio and video where amazing. Great High Definition. Vibrant colors and perfect ear candy in sound.

I highly recommend this feature. Also a wonderful Blu-ray to experience it on. I was thoroughly entertained.",1453420800,3,4021,4.608938547486034
7020274,1,B00TQGGLIE,"I think the synopsis was misleading.  I expected to see people trying to find ways of fending off the meteor.  What I saw was very little of a disaster movie and more sex, drugs, and gruesome acts of violence.  An example of what I mean is one of the characters hacking a man he apparently didn't know with a machete and dead bodies on the streets, and one person hung himself on a power line.  Every other sentence was ""f"" this or you. The only redeeming part of this movie was having the main character help a girl try to find her dad.",1451260800,2,537,4.184466019417476

The disaster, a meteor hit the East coast of the U.S. which started a wall of fire around the globe and decimating everything, Australia is the last and has 12 hours. That being said, we have Jimmy, remarkably played by Nathan Phillips, he wants to party his last hours of life, he comes across a little girl and well, I'm not saying anymore. Except BRAVO to my friends in Australia...please keep making these wonderful films. I now have ""on the beach"" as the #1 of this genre and ""These Final Hours"" as the number 2.

7020284,4,B00TQGGLIE,"Human existence on the Earth is set to end in less than a day.

The Final Day begins with James and his girlfriend, Zoe, in a beach house.  Zoe wants to spend the last day together; James wants to go the last great end of the world party.

The movie is largely about James' trip to the party, and his realization that even with nothing left, he still needs to be human.  The world that James sets out into is probably far more realistic than the gentle, slightly silly world featured in the similarly themed ""Looking for a Friend for the End of the World.""  In this version, bodies are hanging from light poles and children are being kidnapped for rape. James ends up with his car stolen and some other adventures, including rescuing a child, who is about to be raped by two scummy men, and killing the rapists.  James takes the child to the party and gradually comes to realize that in a meaningless time spending more time in the meaningless activities of the party is more than he can bear.  He takes the child to her family and then realizes that he needs to be with Zoe.

The end of the movie is both emotionally and visually powerful.

If you are a hard-core science fiction view and have a high threshold for nihilistic-inspired violence, or, if you are like me, you can squeeze a drop of meaning out of the end of the world, then this is a terrific movie. If not, then this movie is going to leave you depressed and/or confused why anyone would recommend it.",1440720000,3,1466,4.380073800738008

7020299,5,B00TQGGLIE,"Fantastic piece of Australian cinema, something along the lines of another Aussie film- The Rover (2014) but not-quite.

Brief Synopsis: The world is coming to an end...there are less than 24 hours left before a huge cataclysm will strike Australia (the rest of the world either  already perished or is about to) a young man is visiting his lover who is pregnant with his baby.  However, after a brief stay and quick farewell he sets out in a stolen car to attend the FINAL PARTY (basically a wild house-pool party filled with death games, orgies, plenty of alcohol and loads of drugs).  At the party the girlfriend of the main hero awaits him...will he make it before the time? Watch and find out...

I don't understand folks who gave this film 3 or less stars...seriously these folks must have watched a different film from the one I saw.
These Final Hours (2013) is a great film to watch with your significant other and/or family.  Imagine yourself in a similar situation as the main character, would you act in similar fashion?

The ending of the film is very powerful...last time I saw such ending was in the City of Angels (1998).",1437868800,,1136,4.65

Synopsis: Meteor hits the north Atlantic creating a firestorm that within the day will eventually engulf the world.
I'm all for media dumbing down America but ...
1. It shouldn't be a meteor but an asteroid if it's to have any chance at all at being such a bad boy. Second it would have been seen and dealt with by a whole host of currently available technologies to render it a nonexistent threat.
2. Hitting the ocean (known to have water in it - duh!, would have extinguished any supposed firestorm) and fire does need fuel besides O2.
3. Of course, with only a day left, the story needs some tragic love - that's called creative writing. So our central figure is off searching.
4. The usual scattered bodies spaced logically so as to fill the screen with well placed bits of blood indicating self inflicted wounds. Strange I didn't see any animals feasting on the newly placed food sources.
5. A few well placed fires; the usual burning tires and a few CGIs of buildings.
6. Usual long slow cinematic time-lapse scenes of clouds and flocks of birds (they are flocking because they have an ominous sense it's the end). Also a dead crow; it too must have also sensed the end and took its own life.
7. Usual abandoned cars, some trashed, some lined up askew on a roadway.
8. Usual couple of fight scenes. Why? It's the end of the world!
9. For some reason, for most of the movie, we only see one person driving in the whole city of Perth - our protagonist.
10. Usual helpless stranger is rescued by our protagonist. How original!
11. Our driving protagonist is constantly complaining of low petrol so why doesn't he just siphon any of the many abandoned cars?
12. Wouldn't be a good ending unless we had a group of people deciding that a party was in order - of course, sex and drugs.
13. Forgot, for most of this creative endeavor there is someone doing a radio broadcast voiceover - as if we needed to know what's going on!
14. Usual misleading DVD cover - we don't get to see anyone getting crisped at the end. Too bad, that would have been an easy cheap CGI.
15. It is an Aussie film, with WellGo and other notoriously cheap studios backing its production. All they needed was to add some Mexican, Hollywood & N.Y. studios to really dumb it down.",1436745600,3,2468,4.450331125827814

The movie starts moments after a meteor has crashed into north america. The continent has been devastated, demolished, and now it and its inhabitants are gone. The rest of the world will soon follow. On the other side of the world - Australia - our anti-hero has left his pregnant girlfriend to go to the party-of-all-parties and die amidst a drug, sex, and alcohol driven orgy. En route to the party, he saves a little girl and suddenly he finds himself torn between the friends that await him and the little girl's desire to be with her family during these final hours.
The story is a heady mix of how people deal with death - from the horrific to the anguish to the humor. And while you may have to suspend some disbelief from time to time, the movie can be forgiven for that trespass.
Ultimately, the story is an action flick with a heart, about a man who searches his soul and seeks to find his own redemption during his final hours.",1433030400,3,1148,4.6048780487804875

7020330,5,B00TQGGLIE,"Audiences across the world never seem the slake their thirst for the apocalypse. Movie after movie after movie are made depicting the end of the world, or nearly on the brink. Youd think given the abundance of world ending tales of woe we (the audience) would become hardened to its tropes, accustomed to the standard conventions of finite time on Earth, that filmmakers would give up on trying to create a new feeling or impression of the end.

They dont. They don't because zombies and vampires and supernatural calamities are an entertaining way to visit terrible ends to our species, without the underlying reality of possibility. We love our apocalyptic tales dressed up in monsters and otherworldly themes that stand no chance of happening in the real. When we do get a tale of the end that tries to stay grounded its usually tempered with hope and light. A little cream added to cut down the bitterness of our beverage. Something to take the edge off. Dull the blade so to speak.

Not in this review. These Final Hours gives us razor sharp depiction of life at the end. A beautiful and smartly rendered snapshot of how people might react in the face of complete destruction and devastation. A film that shows the hidden nature of humanity. Exposes the fragility of societal bonds. Shows just how quickly the social contract becomes null and void in the face of extinction. Makes you ask the question  If the world were coming to end, what would my priorities be?

The story follows a young man (Nathan Phillips) as those around prepare for an Extinction Level Event to reach Australia. In his quest for a friends end of the world party (so he can drug out and enjoy his final hours) he is set on a road of redemption after saving the life of a little girl (Angourie Rice) who has become separated from her father.

These Final Hours is a tour de force. Writer/director Zak Hilditch does a masterful job depicting Perth during the final twelve hours of its existence, creating a landscape that is all at once eerie, haunting, deadly, and fascinating. So many filmmakers are tempted to dilute the atmosphere with endless carnage and action; over the top spectacle from beginning to end, as if to constantly remind the audience that things are horrible. That hell on Earth has come.

Hilditch does it right. Relying mostly on subtle set pieces depicting people at their best and worst. Images of what people have left behind. Messages written on sidewalks, cars and garage doors. The occasional remains of those whove either succumb to violence or their own self inflicted fate. The subtle environment makes all the more effective those moments when brutality and insanity take center stage for necessity of a scene. The entire landscape is so masterfully staged I found myself wanting to walk among the streets as a ghost, observing, glimpsing the most realistic depiction of the apocalypse Ive ever seen on screen.

Adding to the canvas are the performances of an amazing cast of characters living out their time in Hilditchs tragedy. Nathan Phillips is simply amazing. Playing James, a man whos never really grown up or taken responsibility for himself. A character who isn't a hero, isn't an anti-hero, but just a normal man. Scared, lonely, unsure of himself from beginning to end. His uneasiness and uncertainty is so believable in the context of this film that you feel everything he feels as hes torn between doing the right thing and doing nothing. After all, if the world is ending why does the right thing matter?

Balancing out Phillips performance is Angourie Rice, playing Rose the little girl whose fate is altered by a chance encounter. Seeing the end of the world through the eyes of child, she provides a counterbalance in perspective that is powerful, emotional, and devastating.

These Final Hours pulls no punches. Its an end of the world story from beginning to end. It doesnt cheat. It shows the best of people in the worst of times and it does it extremely well. With grace, beauty and brutality.

This is now my favorite movie in its genre and the best Australian film Ive seen to date. I truly hope those filmmakers from down under keep at it because they are blowing Hollywood out of the water.",1432857600,3,4225,4.7753424657534245

Having covered the only negative points, which is Amazon's fault entirely, the movie itself was interesting enough. The character was likeable and I liked his progression from beginning to end.

I wondered, though - if the meteor hit in North America would it really take that long for devastation to engulf Australia? Also, why a huge fireball? I mean, no dissipation whilst crossing the ocean? It just seemed to move slowly taking continent after continent. If a fireball ensued with the impact, I would think it would move rather quickly over the globe.",1427328000,,874,4.705882352941177

7020356,3,B00TQGGLIE,"These Final Hours is set in Perth, Western Australia and nearby areas, where we know life has already been wiped out in Europe, a radio show tells us death is rolling through North America as the film begins and the extermination force (a big fire wall approaching over the ocean as a result of a meteor impact in the North Atlantic) is only hours away from Perth.  There is no escaping death, there is no where to run too, it's already nearly unbearably hot.  Although obviously a lot of people have vacated Perth, others have shut themselves in doors to die in their own familiar surroundings.  Some though are determined to party until they're dead, and that's where our main character James (Nathan Phillips) who we follow all events through the film with, is headed, that is until he is forced to stop his car due to a homemade blockade and a guy with a machete jumps in and tells him to drive.  Of course his journey doesn't end with that guy, along the way he will be forced to make moral choices he had no intention of thinking about in his final hours, the first major one being does he help a screaming little girl being dragged into a house by two paedophiles, or does he just steal their van so he can get to the party?

The film is pretty simply shot, there's not a lot of actors in the film, and most that appear are extras playing corpses who have taken their own lives or had it taken by someone else.  The storyline works because the main character James isn't the morally nice guy most survival films have as a character in this sort of film.  So you don't know (although you can still guess some) if he will automatically indeed do that choice you'd hope you yourself would in this situation.  Nathan Phillips does do a good job in the lead role, as does the young girl (Angourie Rice) who plays Rose.

Although the film is probably the most realistic of the end of world genre, it lacks the entertainment factor, well fun entertainment factor, that a lot of films that are granted less real do. You certainly wouldn't want to mistake this one for a comedy. Usually as well there's quite a few characters to follow on the screen compared to just following one man's final couple of hours on earth.

7020359,5,B00TQGGLIE,"I usually don't rate movies but this was an excellent film.  Most apocalypse movies rely on CGI (computer generated graphics)  to compel a story.  This one in my opinion did better than the ones that do with almost no aid of it.  Great acting, dynamic characters, very dramatic and believable.  I am not familiar at all with Nathan Phillips but he drove this picture to perfection and along with the production value...  5 Stars... ok 4.9 stars.  I will round up for an independent film.",1426550400,11,487,4.658823529411765
7020360,4,B00TQGGLIE,"A modern twist of On The Beach.  Decent movie, though depressing as heck.  I'd like to be a Pollyanna and think that humanity might face ""the end"" (if there is an end) with a bit of dignity, but movies like this are a bit more realistic than their 1950's counterparts.

Not a really heady movie, but a good watch if you are into apocalyptic features.  After watching this, I'm heading off to have ice cream with my extremely happy pugs, who if the end of the world were coming, would face ""the end"" with the same oblivious happiness they bring to waking up every day on planet Earth.

7020367,5,B00TQGGLIE,"""Nathan Phillips"" best known to horror fans for his roles in ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Chernobyl Diaries"" Heads up the cast in this film in which there is only about 15 hours left until the world comes to an end by way of fire. He plays James, a seemingly self centered party boy.

On his way to the last party ever, where everyone  gets wasted and acts like Sodom and Gomorrah part 2, James stumbles upon Rose ""Angourie Rice"" a little girl who has been taken by two disgusting pedophiles. He saves her then has to make a moral judgement as to take her to her family or go to the party.

From there James and Rose create a bond and encounter all types of inhumane people. There's violence, some very graphic but nothing really slasher film worthy save one scene with a machete. It's a very moving story that is also very frightening because it seems so plausible.

Nathan Phillips looks sexier than ever, showing six pack abs and a bit more than that in one scene. This is definitely not a feel good movie but there are moments that restore your faith in mankind when so much madness and debauchery are lurking in every corner.

There have been some good movies out of Australia lately with Wolf Creek 2, The Babadook and now, this one. It's not as action packed as the trailer would have you believe, but it's a really good movie with Great character development and beautiful Cinematography .",1425686400,26,1386,4.484126984126984

8702802,5,B00TQGGLIE,"Gripping and well made, simultaneously uplifting and redemptive but also depressing and definitely apocalyptic, this is the beautifully filmed story of two people facing the end of the world in Perth, Australia. The day the film depicts beginning about ten minutes after an asteroid impacts the north Atlantic Ocean, there are about 12 hours before a global firestorm reaches Perth. It is heavily implied again and again everyone knows this asteroid strike was coming and really there was no way to survive it. The world is truly ending.

The story is essentially about how people chose to spend those final hours and how they decide to face the end. Will they fall into crime and violence? Party until they are numb and don't care? Spend quiet time with family and friends? Take their own lives and/or the lives of loved ones so they don't feel any pain from the coming firestorm? Face the coming apocalypse, wanting to feel and experience things up until the very last moment, maybe alone, maybe with those they love most, maybe with complete strangers?

The movie focuses on two people. We get James, the main character, who in the beginning is with his lover Zoe, enjoying each others intimate company on the beach and what they know will be a great view of the firestorm. Zoe, who tells James she is pregnant, wants James to stay, but James wants to join his friend for one final party and get wasted, blocking all feelings for what is going to happen and is really rather upset to receive such serious news on his last day alive. Understandable, certainly, but also selfish, and James leaves over Zoes objections to make his way to his friend Freddys party.

Along the way James encounters signs of the end of the world, one of them two men taking a young teenage girl into a house with the obvious intent to rape her. Torn between going on his way to the party and rescuing the girl, James finds he just cant leave the girl to that fate, even knowing she would die in less than 12 hours and rescues her.

The girl  her name Rose  was never someone James intended to bond with, but bond he does while hoping to find Roses dad (Rose and her father got separated) or failing that, leaving her with someone while he makes his way to the party, but events don't go as planned owing to a variety of encounters along the way. Also along the way James becomes less selfish and redeems himself, finding peace with his life and what he needs to do in his final hours, some of that from Roses positive influence, some of that from the quest to get her to her father and to do something selfless in his last hours on earth.

The movie was beautifully filmed with just gorgeous use of color and light. It had just the right touches of post-apocalyptic mayhem without being ugly or brutal (certainly nothing quite as dark as The Walking Dead or the like). Some of the encounters were tropes of a sort of this subgenre  people trying to take your working vehicle for instance  but others were not and a surprise. The actor who played James (Nathan Phillips) did a great job and was believable as he made the slow slide from selfish and nihilistic to a man on a mission to a man at peace, and Rose (played by Angourie Rice) was endearing, right between the line of a child and an intelligent and quite capable adult, precocious and frustrating and very well portrayed.

The movie reminded me a bit of Iain Rob Wrights novella _Tar_ and the novel and the movie _On the Beach_ but I think was superior to either one (though they are all quite good). If you like any of those three you would enjoy this film.",1530835200,,3596,4.509984639016897

Suicide? Partying? With loved ones?

8702808,4,B00TQGGLIE,"Not a family friendly film as this film is ""Not Rated"", but after seeing it certainly a strong R, sometimes bordering on NC-17 (nudity, sex, drug use, strong language and graphic, sometimes gory, violence). This is the last 12 hours of humanities time on earth. How people in this city of Perth face that runs the gamut in highly realistic and sometimes very grim fashion. The action centers around one far less then great man, you could almost say a low life here, and how he ends up achieving redemption at the 11th hour of the end of the world while while humanity is falling apart all around him. It is this unexpected by him journey toward redemption that makes the film something special and worth seeing. Great and sometimes wrenching performances by both Nathan Phillips and Angourie Rice.
