8169014,3,B000MGUZ66,This one is worth watching.  A good storyline with interesting twists along the way.  And Taimak is good as the lead character's brother.,1357862400,,137,4.913043478260869
8169015,5,B000MGUZ66,"This movie really touches on a subject that many of us are not aware of, corruption in our ""justice"" system.  I felt the acting was pure and raw, just like the streets the film was shot on.  Thank you Hawthorne and Tariq for making this film.",1179532800,9,242,4.239130434782608
8169016,1,B000MGUZ66,This movie is worse than anything Stephen Segal ever made.  Poor acting; almost no discernible plot.  It's crap.  It's not even worth the $1.00 RedBox rental.  A complete waste of time.,1178928000,6,185,4.870967741935484
8169017,3,B000MGUZ66,"This movie was actually pretty good.  The story line got a little ridiculous at points but always recovered.  There are a a few veteran actors (Taimak) in this movie which helped tremendously to pull it off.

Brief synopsis (I'll try not to spoil the plot):  The movie is about a boy named Tony who is sent away from home after getting into some trouble in the streets.  He becomes a male model as an adult and returns home where he meets his wife and has a child.  He becomes caught up in some kind of drug/money racket and gets set up by the people he's running for and sent to prison on some bunk charge.  For some reason no one can seem to help him! His lawyer can't help him, not even his pastor brother (Taimak)can help. While in prison his wife does somethings to help him get out but only makes the situation worse and his brother is killed as a result.  He escapes prison in some far fetched, crazy manner and goes about finding out who killed his brother and who set him up.  The title of the movie doesn't really reconcile with the plot of the movie at all, the ""System Within"" refers to a subplot in the movie when Tony is in prison.  This prison storyline is where the movie faulters the most.

It was an alright movie.  Rent before you buy.  It may not be worth $17.00.",1175990400,10,1283,4.25206611570248
