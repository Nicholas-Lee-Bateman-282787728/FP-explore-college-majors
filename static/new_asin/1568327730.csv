187013,5,1568327730,"I had gotten out of shape over the past few years and had a nice little  tire started, but after using this tape three times (and two of those  weren't even all the way through) I could already see my abs toning up.  This really will help anybody and gives great results.  It's also tough,  and you might have to pause the tape for a minute during the workout, but  it's well worth it.",962668800,2,385,4.135135135135135
187014,5,1568327730,This is a workout is great for people who don't have a lot of time for a workout but want results.  It develops muscle and cardiovascular at the same time and allows you to start light and work your way up.  I personally  enjoy the the extra energy it gives me throughout the day as well as that  well toned look.  It requires very inexpensive equipment (a few dumbells)  and doesn't get boring.  I look forward to seeing Gilad Janklowicz other  videos.,917308800,8,453,4.439024390243903
187015,5,1568327730,"Tamilee Webb's THIGHS OF STEEL is available used for one cent!  You can get this great tape for a penny plus shipping costs!

THIGHS OF STEEL offers two workout sessions, which instructor Tamilee Webb leads.  Appearing with Tamilee are two other young women named Lori and Megan but neither takes the lead or says much.

The first THIGHS OF STEEL segment is more of a calorie-burner, with lots of movement as it keeps you on your feet.  The second emphasizes exercising muscle groups, keeping you on the floor.

Tamilee, Lori and Megan all wear one-piece, thong leotards in both THIGHS OF STEEL segments.  Of greater significance, each girl wears flesh-colored stockings, making for a number of sexy views of their backsides, which their thong outfits do little to cover.  Tamilee Webb's big beautiful bottom stands out, as(s) she's closer to the camera than the other two but(t) also because Tamilee is by far the best-looking girl, especially from the rear.

To my surprise and delight, in THIGHS OF STEEL Tamilee shows off her fine behind much more than she has in her other thighs, abs, and even buns workout tapes.  In the second segment, Tamilee teaches a couple of exercises resting face down on the floor, her thong doing nothing to hide her sumptuously round butt cheeks.  What must be a male camera operator makes the most of the opportunity by treating us to salivating close-ups of Tamilee's amazing rear end.  Who could resist?  It surprises me that no one bounces a quarter off that bottom of hers as she rests there!

Lori and Megan, however, get the best view of Tamilee Webb's bottom as(s) they are right behind (tee-hee) Tamilee throughout THIGHS OF STEEL.  In the second segment, where the girls stay in one position for minutes at a time, you will notice Lori and Megan staring at Tamilee's protruding posterior.  Each girl cannot help but smile several times, not wanting to look but unable to stop checking out Tamilee's tush.

As with other Tamilee Webb fitness videos, the producers short-change Tamilee's talents by issuing THIGHS OF STEEL on the cheap S.L.P. speed tape.  Here's hoping THIGHS OF STEEL, along with other early, superb Tamilee videos (ABS OF STEEL, to name one) that were on crummy S.L.P. tape could come out on D.V.D..  I doubt there is much of a market for it, unfortunately.",1176422400,2,2318,4.822784810126582
187016,5,1568327730,"This is a great upper body workout,This is a great workout for women as well as men. I think women will love doing this workout to tone and define their arms as well a get a good look at Gilad. I loved his legs of steel workout,thats what made me want to give this a try. Both tapes are intitled the Men of Steel series,but they are for us to ladies. Gilad really gets you motivated to get up and get moving,I am a big fan of his Bodies in Motion show now. I also want to add his all of his tapes to my collection. This is also a great tape to get your man up going to get into shape. I would highly reccomend this tape. Gilad is a hottie.",1161388800,,639,3.8484848484848486
187017,4,1568327730,"Gilad leads this 40 minute upper body workout, it is thorough and hits everything, including chest and back which are often neglected in arm workouts, plus forearms and rotator cuff.  He is instructing one on one in a comfy workout room, he has his weight rack beside him and he is set to go.

He starts you out with a simple warmup, then you move right into the workout.  He starts with some chest presses and does not use any weight for the first set, then he grabs some light weights and you do another set, then you will do a set of chest crossovers adding a side step and cross with the opposite arm.

Next you will work the shoulders, starting with front raises rotating the palms upward, then you will do a set of side lateral raises before combining the two for another set.  Then you will get some lighter weights and do some rotator cuff work, then you finish out the shoulders with some rear delt lifts.

Triceps are next, you will start with double arm kickbacks before  moving into one arm kickbacks for each side.  Then you will do a set of tricep dips in a 2-2 count.  Then you grab a medium weight  (he uses a 10 lb) and do a set of french presses.  A second set of tricep dips follows, this time you will do them in single count.  Then you will grab a slightly heavier weight (ex 12 lb) and do another set of french presses.  One more set of tricep dips follow, this time you will do 3 counts down, 1 count up.  Finally you will finish your tricep work with a third set of french presses, this time using your heaviest weight.

Now it's time for biceps and forearm work.  Gilad grabs a pair of 10 pounders from his weight rack and you will do a set of traditional curls where you twist up at the top, there are some tempo variation here (2-2 count, 3-1 count, single time).  Then you will do a set of cross curls working the forearms before doing another set of biceps using a little heavier weight, after that you will do more forearm curls one arm at a time.  Then you will do a set of classic 24's, 8 reps where you lift halfway up, 8 reps where you start at the top and lower halfway down, and 8 reps using full range of motion, he uses 10 lbs for these.  Then to finish out the bicep work you grab a heavy weight and do one arm concentration curls, again with some tempo variation.  Following this he will do some more forearm work and some wrist curls.

Next you will do a short back session, one arm rows for each side, again some different counts.  Then you will grab some light weights and do some combination exercises for all the muscle groups you just worked.  Here you will see 2 combinations, the first being a combination of cross arms and side & front delt raises, and the other a combination of bicep curls and overhead tricep extensions, then you combine both sets to finish out.

Finally you will do three sets of pushups, each set each about 10  reps.  The first set you will start with your hands wide, each set your hands are set more narrow to make it tougher.  Then it's time to cool down and stretch.

I like Gilad, and I think he does a good job here.  I really like that he tells you what size weight he uses for each exercises, it helps me give me a gauge on what I should be using.  He does sneak a few extra reps in which might annoy some people, especially if they think there is only one rep and he adds on two more.  But he is a friendly instructor but to the point, plus he lets you know that he is working hard too.  He even strains on the last rep of the last set of french presses, which I always get a kick out of.  The workout does move at a quick pace, there is a good amount of reps and tempo variations for most of the exercises, I find I have to use slightly lighter weights due to the number of reps and speed of the workout.

All in all this is an excellent routine for all people, not just men.  Ladies can get arms of steel with this video too.",1143936000,4,3908,4.144754316069057
187018,5,1568327730,"My wife gave me this video, along with weights at my request as a birthday present 9 years ago and I'm still using them today. The video is easy to follow from the beginning and is perfect for someone just starting out.  As you progress in fitness levels, you decide the amount of weight to use for each exercise.  The results are worth the 45 minutes spent three times a week.  You feel more confident and the results are noticeable.  There is no other video workout for men like this on the market that I have found.  I highly recommend it to any man wanting to strengthen his upper body without investing a fortune.",1128038400,,618,4.385964912280702
187019,5,1568327730,"This is one of those workouts in the "" ...of Steel"" series, but this one is directed to men, unlike most of them. The instructor, Gilad, has a pleasant accent and really knows his stuff. In about 45 minutes he takes you through a good warmup, the gamut of upper-body exercises, and a surprisingly long stretch. All the exercises are concise and are super-set (you don't rest between them except to exchange weights). Between the bicepts, tricepts, forearms, chest, shoulders, and back, this workout will build all facets of your arms. Best of all, you can suit the weights you use to your fitness level. This video is motivating and rewarding and, while I would not want to do it daily, it is a good break for me to do once a week or so (I am a woman).

187020,5,1568327730,"First time using it, my abs were sore for 2 days!  Arms and shoulders were, too, but it's a ""I'm toning up, so it's going to hurt a little"" kind of feeling.  I like the way she does an arm exercise, then to the floor for an ab, then arm, then ab so you feel you can get through the whole tape.  I used the soup cans for my initial weights and it's working great until I feel like I can graduate up to actual weights. I'm excited about this workout!",1082764800,,448,3.901098901098901
187021,5,1568327730,I have had this tape for a little over a year and I just started using it again. I love the fact it alternates between floor and arm exercises. My arms are coming along and I know I will see results if I stick to it.,1047600000,,216,3.717391304347826
187022,5,1568327730,"I love this workout. Simply put: great pacing, perfect cueing, challenging exercises, wonderful results. I'm a chick, too -- I can follow along fine, and just stick w/ the lighter weights when he moves up to the twenty pounders.
Gilad rocks -- you'll see. He's very encouraging, and the way he counts down while sneaking in tips on proper form/alignment helps the time fly during reps. Also, it cracks me up when, after the brief warmup, he looks into the camera & says, ""OK, men, now it's time to work on our arms of steel!"" with this cute little nod of his head....
Oh dear, I'm afraid I'm losing my objectivity, here. Regardless, this is a GREAT arms, chest, shoulders workout. Not so much for building mass, as one reviewer pointed out, but you will get some nice definition before you know it. Money well spent, indeed!",1013472000,12,824,4.612244897959184
187023,5,1568327730,"This is a great video!!!!  I have several Tamilee videos, and I think this one is the best.  This video alternates between arm and ab exercises.  The heavier the weights and the harder the intensity of your movements, the better your results will be.  I have been using this video 2-3 times a week for about 3 months now.  My arms are VERY toned.  My abs are coming along, but after 3 kids, I do have a long way to go.  I recommend this video to anyone who wants to shape up their arms and abs.",1001030400,9,494,4.083333333333333
187024,5,1568327730,"I am not a man but I love this video.  This is a great video for toning  your arms.  He works with as little as 5lbs up to 20lbs. I don't go that  high but for myself a set of 5, 8, & 10 work well and I feel pleasently  sore the next day.  This video works all parts of the arm plus the chest  and the back as well.  Most videos for women neglect the chest and back so  I am really glad to get those here.  The tape last about 45 minutes and he  does separate upper body moves and then for the last 15 minutes he does  combo moves working several parts at once. Definately recommend this tape  for anyone who wants to sculpt their upper body.",969235200,16,642,3.8461538461538463
