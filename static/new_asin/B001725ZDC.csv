3167066,5,B001725ZDC,Caamp Rock is a fantastic Disney Hit! The  only thing is they lip sync and it so clear they are because They either are lip syncing to fast or they are lip sycing to slow to the words. I know it is their voices though. Still. Camp Rock is very cool and Very awsome!,1214352000,,265,3.9074074074074074
3167067,4,B001725ZDC,"Can't help but think of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL while watching CAMP ROCK, but it has some charms of its own and it isn't EXACTLY a cookie cutter replica of the two HSM movies--though I will say that setting it in a summer camp for musicians is a tiny bit like the setting of the second HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, especially the many scenes of HSM2 and CAMP ROCK set in the institutional kitchens while cooking and washing dishes and peeling potatoes for 100s of people--OK, those scenes were the same.

Except that in HSM2 Gabriella did not have to be pretend to be a rich spoiled daughter of a Japanese CEO, and she did not have to lie about her mother being a cook.  That makes the new picture a little bid sadder and a little bit more serious, because Mitchie definitely has mother-daughter shame issues.  Sort of like Susan Kohner did in the Douglas Sirk version of IMITATION OF LIFE, Mitchie is bitterly ashamed to have a mother who cooks for a living and works at ""Connie's Catering Company.""

By the way, all the food Connie makes in the movie looks fantastic, especially the cupcakes and those fake CDs covered with icing!  Disney should put together a ""Connie's Catering Cookbook,"" to showcase some of the wonderful food featured in CAMP ROCK.  I'm surprised the students weren't super fat getting to sample Connie's delicious wares.  Instead they're fairly slim, especially the two rapping dance boys who get to lead the Hasta la Vista crew.

But the music is the important thing.  There aren't any numbers as catchy as the songs in HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL or as ""What Time Is It?"" in HSM 2, but give them time, they will grow on you.  The horrible blonde Tess Tyler actually gets to sing two of the better numbers in the score, ""Too Cool for You"" and her finale with all the mirrors, and most of the kids get to chime in here and there.  Demi Lovato as Mitchie Torres is cute in a Mary Diaz way, but she smiles way too much!  While we watched the movie at my apartment, a crowd of grownups gathered with a big quart of Scotch and we were told to take a drink every time Mitchie shows that appealing grin, and everyone was drunk within the first twenty minutes.  She's wonderful in the part (especially in the sad moments) but, enough with the choppers, Demi!  Two of us had an argument about the young actress, and one said that her resemblance to Demi Moore was so strong she must be the daughter of the veteran star from the 1980s and 1990s.

But I think of her as her own creation, and she's very believable.  As Shane Gray, the bad boy rock star, Joe Jonas wires the floor with Zac Efron.  His big bushy black eyebrows look like crows feathers--feathers form a 600 pound crow.  How does he even see out from under those brows?  Maybe that's why his gaze seems fixed to the ground, as though he were a shy wallflower.  The other two brothers have regular eyebrows, it's just Joe who's had the brow transplants I guess.  He is sort of like John Cuaack, if Cusack had any sex appeal, and sort of like Joe D'Allesandro, if the latter were a topnotch rock musician.  Anyhow Mitchie and Shane have a lot of chemistry, and I think should somehow be incorporated (or promoted) into the upcoming big screen HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3 SENIOR YEAR.",1214265600,,3233,4.4718909710391825
3167068,5,B001725ZDC,I am a 33 single mom of two.  My daugter is 11 and son 9.  They absolutely loved it.  My daughter is a HSM fanatic and she said this was better.  Myself admitting I loved it too!  For the fact here are The Jonas Bros attempting acting. They are prof musicians and singers. So to step out and try acting and dancing was great. Then to bring in Demi Levato so fresh and talented. Kudos! The movie kept to plot and dialog without drowning you in song after song. They were placed perfectly. We watched it days earlier on Disney on Demand and since then I think all three of us have caught it all weekend on every place it was shown. All in all I think we have watched it 10 times thanks to DVR!  We really loved it and hope for a return.,1214179200,3,734,4.027586206896552
3167069,4,B001725ZDC,My nine year old loves the Jonas Brothers and this CD was an instant hit.  All the hits from the recently released Camp Rock movie.,1214006400,2,131,4.24
3167070,5,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock is the new Disney summer teen musical & it rocks. The story centers on Mitchie- an ordinary girl who thinks she has to lie to fit in with the cool girls at an exclusive camp dedicated to talented young rockers. Over the course of the movie she learns from friends including a hunky young rockstar & enemies that all she needs to succeed is to be herself!
  It a great message for all young people  but I thinks its the wonderful performance of Demi Lovato as Mitchie & Joe Jonas as the rockstar & the great musical numbers that everybody will really love!
  I should note that Nick & Kevin  Jonas appear in the movie in smaller  supporting roles and do very well. The Jonas Brothers perform a couple songs in the movie and they are great!
  I just saw the movie last nigh & can not wait to see it again!
  The DVD provides an alternate ending and tips from cast members on how to be a rock star. I am, sure the DVD will be worth owning!",1214006400,7,946,4.171270718232044
3167071,5,B001725ZDC,"I must say, I initially wanted to watch this movie simply because of my obsession with the Jonas Brothers. About one minute into the movie, though, I completely forgot about their upcoming appearance and was dazzled by Demi Lovato, who plays a girl named Mitchee who has an incredible voice but is afraid to let people know. One thing I liked about this film was that Mitchee actually was afraid of singing in front of an audience, and didn't just say she was scared and then proceed to belt out a song; rather, she sang quietly at first, eyes on the floor. This made her character extremely relatable and I even surprised myself by feeling my heart start to race when she was about to perform- I was actually nervous for her! It takes talent for an actress to be able to make her audience feel right there with her the whole time, and Demi Lovato certainly has a bright future. Her voice is incredible, and she's a wonderful young actress too, not overacting or acting and doing things a person in the real world wouldn't, as so many Disney stars do these days.
  The Jonas Brothers were also great, but I was surprised and disappointed that Nick and Kevin weren't in the movie much. In fact, I remember thinking half way through, ""where are those two Jonas boys? They've had only one scene and it's halfway through the movie already!"" Joe surprised me too by being a great actor! During the movie, I admit, I never thought of him as Joe Jonas, but rather, Shane Gray.
  Overall, Disney definitely has created another smash hit with ""Camp Rock."" Unlike in other Disney flicks like High School Musical, when some of the girls in this movie get bullied, they get angry rather than shrinking away and moping. One of my favorite scenes, though I won't give anything away, was when one girl got fed up with being treated horribly and rounded on the blond girl, actually yelling at her. Imagine that, yelling in a Disney movie! It was refreshing! The emotions were real, as they were throughout, another thing great about this movie. So, the acting was very, very good, the voices of Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas were outstanding (and I wish I could underline and bold the word ""outstanding""!) and five minutes after watching this on Disney Channel, I find myself wanting to watch it again!
I will definitely be buying this, and I recommend it to everyone, despite whether or not you're a Disney fan. This story is believable, fun to watch, and will leave you craving more!

~a 16 Year old~

P.S. I will admit, it did seem a bit rushed towards the end, but that's not enough of a complaint to dwell on.",1213920000,7,2594,4.54389721627409
3167072,4,B001725ZDC,"My children and I were lucky enough to see this movie a little early due to the fact that it was on Disney On Demand.  Good entertaining movie for the family.  I gave it 4 stars, because I thought it was a little short and could have used a little more substance to the story.  It seemed to have just raced through to the end.  I don't want to ruin the story for everyone, but the music was good and there were some cute parts.  Flour in the face, slipping on the floor and the poor brother with his birdhouse obsession.  I was disappointed that the other Jonas brothers weren't part of the main story, but rather made cameo appearances.  Mitchie and Shane were really cute together and I am glad she put him in his place, because he started out as a real jerk.  I loved their duet together at the end where they put their two different songs together and made it flow as one.  The end was surpising to my children because the person who won the contest was not who they thought it would be.  All in all the kids loved the music and really enjoyed the movie and already they have watched it over and over.  We will definitely be getting the dvd when it comes out.",1213833600,11,1163,4.193693693693693

3167115,3,B001725ZDC,"Eh.
1st: I am a fan of Demi Lovato. But NOT in this movie. Nope. Nope. NOPE.
2nd: Jonas Brothers add a good dynamic to the cast, but the mini plot thing they had going on within their 3 characters was iffy at best.
3rd: The songs are annoying at best, and sort of make the movie seem more like a musical than a movie. And not in a good way.

All in all, I would only recommend people watch this JUST so they could see Camp Rock 2 which is 1000x better. Seriously.",1406505600,,463,3.925531914893617

3167132,3,B001725ZDC,"This movie is typical in just about every way. It has its moments but generally goes for the predictable. Demi plays Mitchie, a cute girl that's very insecure about her life up until now. She enters Camp Rock and meets a couple of girls, one of which who is the snotty, uppity type. Typically, they are rich and she is not and Mitchie tries to be like them and lies a whole lot through the movie to prove that she indeed is like them. Joe Jonas (who plays Shane) and his brothers (save for the younger, less famous Jonas) are in the movie. Joe is the only main character of the brothers however and is endowed the role of the rebellious celebrity. He's at Camp Rock (which he used to attend like Demi) this time as a dance instructor. Through most of the movie he has a bad attitude. It isn't until he hears Demi's character sing a beautiful, inspirational tune that his character starts to change for the better.

Overall, the movie was OK. It has life lessons on how not to be ashamed of where you come from and to follow your dreams. Typical? Yes. But not so bad for the younger audience who could have these values instilled as a reminder. I liked it enough and I'm 27. Hopefully, the younger crowd sticks this one out. Demi does a LOT of lying for a while and doesn't actually stop until she gets caught in her lies pretty much. If anything is taken from this movie it should be the fact that we should all stay true to ourselves.

3167139,2,B001725ZDC,"I will say this right off the bat: this movie is a disappointment. Let's start with the plot.
A young aspiring musician goes to a camp filled with other musically-inclined artists. At Camp Rock, they will harness and expand their ""talents"" (talents which include singing as though they will have an asthma attack any second, and thinking they can dance when they can't). The girl works part-time in the kitchen to pay for her stay, something she keeps from the other campers. At the camp, she meets a teen rocker-idol who is there for punishment (yeah, staying there would DEFINITELY be a punishment). Apparently, his attitude has gotten him into trouble with his bandmates and he needs to cool off. The girl changes the boy over the course of the movie. They fight. The girl does not win the big competition at the end of camp (didn't see that one coming. The main character doesn't win?) Girl and boy make up. The End.
Now let's talk about the music. For the most part, the music is basically rap/hip-hop. As mentioned above, the singing doesn't even make up for the terrible tunes.
If the plotline and characters had been developed a bit more, this might have been a fairly decent film. The only good parts are when all three Jonas brothers are together. They play off each other and deliver their comical lines well. Sadly, the five good minutes when they're all together do not make up for the other 85 that do not include Kevin and Nick.
Final word: skip this movie and watch High School Musical instead.",1273708800,,1510,4.638059701492537

3167142,4,B001725ZDC,"While I'm far from the target audience, I must confess that I've watched some of the current Disney Channel shows and found them quite entertaining. With their Original movies, is another story. Most of those I've seen I found plain, uninteresting and didn't exactly brought my desire to support Disney's profitable (and somewhat desperate) marketing of their newest products, which High School Musical is a clearly example of (although Hannah Montana goes into the same category too, at least it isn't an DC Original movie). When I first heard about Camp Rock, my thoughts were that this was just another soulless attempt to profitable marketing, which it somehow is. But one evening I randomly watched this movie on Disney Channel and I was surprised over finding the movie quite enjoyable and watchable.

The only component I enjoyed about the High School Musical flicks were the songs. Camp Rock is slightly better in many ways. First of all, it has a better story. While there's nothing innovative or groundbreaking about the plot, the story still unfolds nicely throughout the movie and it's a component that actually works. And overall, I felt Camp Rock had more heart and soul than the soulless and bland High School Musical trilogy.

Second, the overall cast are more likeable and not a bunch of intrusive wannabes as the HSM cast. While none of the acting is Oscar-worthy, the cast delivers decent performances without overacting. Demi Lovato portrays Mitchie as a sweet, but insecure and identity-searching girl, without giving the character some real substance. In comparison to Lovato's latest projects, as Sonny With A Chance and Princess Protection Programme, she has definitively improved her acting skills since Camp Rock. Perhaps this is unfair to her, but considering that she's marketed as the competitor of Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez, a comparison is inevitable and Lovato struggles to distinguish herself from her rivals. While she's indeed talented, she doesn't have the it factor and star potential that characterizes both Cyrus and Gomez. In spite of that, Lovato does have the best singing voice of the trio, which she proves both in the movie itself and on the bonus features.

Another surprise comes from Joe Jonas, who plays the apparently unlikeable, but misunderstood rock star Shane Gray. Although Mr. Jonas is far from a versatile actor, his role as a torn celebrity gives the film some weight and depth. Other noteworthy performances come from Alyson Stoner as Mitchie's likeable friend Caytlin Geller, Meaghan Jette Martin as Tess Tyler and Daniel Fathers as the British camp leader Brown Cesario. Fans of Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana will notice the appearances of cast members from each of the shows.

Another good component is the music, which is overall listenable and catchy. Just as High School Musical, this is a musical where people randomly break into song, but the numbers never feels out place. The songs are fun and enjoyable, especially Mitchie's big solo number This Is Me and the final jam song We Rock at the end. By the way, this DVD contains a extra song number, which is called Our Time Is Here, which is passable enough, but nothing beyond that.

If there's something to complain about Camp Rock, it would be that some of the final conclusions feels somewhat rushed and leaves again some questions, but it doesn't ruin the overall impression of this movie.

BONUS FEATURES.
The bonus features are divided into two sections, which is Music and More and Backstage Disney. While the former mostly includes more or less the same musical sequences of the film, just with lyrics on screen, the real interesting features lies on the Backstage Disney section.

First up is a own section which is called How to be a rock star, which contains seven shorts. All can be played together into a 27:54 minutes featurette (which is actually recommended, for the continuity and cohesiveness of the feature). The video features interviews from the cast and directors and while some of context is somewhat preachy and aimed for kids (at least those over eight), it's still pretty informative, entertaining and not so fluffy to scare away an adult audience. The whole crew comes off as sympathetic, likeable and enthusiastic, so watching the interviews with them is a blast.

Next up is a fifteen minutes and fourty-five seconds featurette Jonas Brothers: Real Life Rock Stars, which is an insightful and interesting featurette portraying the brothers busy life. The siblings appear as nice and grounded guys and their hardcore fans will most likely love this.

Afterwards comes the Introducing Demi Lovato (5:40) featurette, which is rather more brief comparing to the two former featurettes, but still informative. This inside-scoop with Demi is about her interest in music and her experience with making this movie and Demi comes off as a shy, but likeable girl.

Camp Memories (5:49) is probably the most disappointing featurette on this DVD. With the exception of two brief video shots, this featurette is rather like a slideshow reel with personal photos taken by the cast and crew.

Hasta la vista: From rehearsal to final Jam (4:55) is the insight of the making of Hasta la Vista musical number and cast members Jordan Francis and Roshon Fegan gets interviews and sing as well. A cute short, but brief.

Too Cool: Setting the Scene (3:37) is about the preparation about Tess' big musical number Too Cool and has brief interviews with some of the girls in the cast. Actually a little more technical and informative than the Hasta la Vista featurette, but also too brief.

Overall, this is what you get by the Camp Rock DVD. The movie itself is actually pretty cute and entertaining. It may be silly to recommend a Disney Channel Original Movie so warmly, but Camp Rock is really worth a watch, in my opinion and it's better than HSM and even Hannah Montana The Movie.

When it comes to the overall judgment of the Bonus Features, I find it somewhat odd that a so heavily marketed product film doesn't include more extras, but the final featurettes are mostly enjoyable and watchable and will definitively please the fans.",1266624000,,6180,4.9815712900097

Anyways, i saw it on TV and put songs from it on my Zune, and I still can't get enough of it. It's catchy and fun, and it tells the truth about trying to fit in as a teenager(and of course how lying about who you are will bite you in the butt). Demi Lovato is a really great actress, and she sure has a set of pipes on her (man she can sing!!).

3167145,1,B001725ZDC,"""Camp Rock"" is more like ""Camp Crude.""  I hoped it would channel some of the energy and zest of High School Musical, but it was HSM's weak, mean-spirited shadow and lacked the Disney touch.  A few examples: When the heroine reveals that she lied by glamorizing her parents to fit in, she never apologizes to the group she's deceived, no one steps forward to reassure her that bucks and bling aren't what's really important, and her Mom doesn't mind at all  that her daughter is blisteringly ashamed of their family.  Kids repeatedly call each other ""jerk.""  The bad girl is shallow and just plain mean, with none of the comic genius that Ashley Tisdale brought to the parallel role in HSM.

The big dance numbers that played so well in HSM's expansive cafeteria and hallway scenes are here dampened by the confines of low-roofed camp mess halls, and there's not a song you'll be singing the next day.

The film itself is typical for a DCOM movie. But, it has a sort of charm that manages to make you smile after a long day. The cast works well together, though there were some plot points that seemed overlooked, and others that they spent too much time going through. Apart from Joe, the rest of the Brothers don't have much of a part, and seem thrown in only as an afterthought.

The music is similar to what you'd expect in ""High School Musical"". It's catchy and upbeat, and chances are you'll have at least one of the songs stuck in your head for a few days after the viewing.

3167171,3,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock was heavily advertised on Disney Channel Asia as THE greatest DCOM yet.. and thinking HSM got me hooked, I thought Camp Rock might do the same. Plus I adore Demi Lovato however, I'm not a fan of Jonas Brothers but lucky for me, only the cute one Joe is in the movie and Nick and Kevin appeared for few minutes.. and Kevin being the dumb Jonas in the movie is ridiculous and annoying.

Storyline...wait what story? Haven't I seen hundreds of movies with the same storyline before? Girl lies to fit in, girl meets boy and two gets attracted to each other, rival reveals the truth, everyone briefly hates the girl, girl realize her mistake.. then they live happily ever after. Oh so typical. It's very predictable since the beginning of the movie.

The story bored me. I was not interested at all. It was nothing new. Plus lots of plot holes which I'm not gonna dwell into as it could take ages to write. Only part worth watching is the final jam. Songs? I was expecting something like HSM but what the heck? The only good song that I like is This Is me/Gotta Find You when Mitchie sings with Shane at the end and that's it... cast is very forgettable, songs are not that catchy and very forgettable.. dance moves are all over the place and doesn't match..

Even though I adore Demi, she cannot dance! It was a pain watching her sing and dance to her song because she overdo it. Overall, it's just an ok movie. The majority who thinks the movie rocks are Jonas Brothers fans.. they don't care if the movie sucks, they just wanna see The Jonas Brothers.. and that's how Disney sell the movie - by featuring Jonas Brothers as if they're the lead characters when they're just supporting and don't appear much. The DVD cover is so misleading. The story is more on conflict of Mitchie, Tess & Caitlyn.. Mitchie & Shane has chemistry, but eh... they didn't make it interesting at all... unlike in HSM with Troy & Gabriella...

Good try but uh no thanks, I'll stick to HSM.",1220745600,4,1973,4.457063711911357
3167172,4,B001725ZDC,"This is a Disney Channel Original Movie, so don't go into it expecting anything too much in the way of a plot.  The sitcom-type story is supported (and padded) by a full soundtrack of tween pop music and dancing, and touches on many of the issues facing the target age group, namely fitting in, peer pressure, un-cool and too-cool parents, jealousy, and last but not least, loving the Jonas Brothers.

Tween idol Joe Jonas plays the leading man, a young pop star who's been behaving badly, and gets sentenced to teaching dance classes at an upscale summer camp for musicians.  The other Jonas brothers also play supporting roles, and perform a couple of songs at the camp.

Demi Lovato plays the female lead, a promising singer/songwriter whose mother takes a catering job at the camp so that she can afford the fees.  There's also the rich girl, played by Meaghan Jette Martin, and her obligatory two henchgirls; the usual outcast who befriends the new girl (well played by Alyson Stoner), and the well intentioned Camp Director.  Add some supporting singers and dancers, and a ready group of back-up dancers, and you have (drum roll) Camp Rock.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Girl goes to camp and meets boy
2. Girl messes up big time
3. This is a Disney movie, so after the song and dance, everyone lives happily ever after.

While I recognize the age-appropriate manner in which the movie addresses certain issues, the wrapping up happens far too quickly to be even remotely believable, but then, the target audience probably isn't paying too much attention to the story anyway.

I've seen girls doing the ""I'm not worthy"" bow in front of posters for this movie, so I'm guessing that it would be a good gift for any fan of the Jonas Brothers on your list.

Tween rating: 4.5 stars
Adult rating: 3 stars (given for the music and the family values)

3167174,4,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock was so long anticipated for its Disney Channel premiere that, as far as the local kids were concerned, the world stopped turning that evening. Though it's sort of being sold as a Jonas movie, it's really a vehicle for up-and-coming young star Demi Lovato and ""ouch he's sooooooo keee-uwww-te!"" Joe Jonas. His brothers have marginal roles, reportedly due to Joe's insistence they be included. Demi has that Sally Field winsomeness down pat -- ABC should have no trouble recasting if they ever bring back The Flying Nun. (Seriously, which Saint can I pray to for that? I loved that show.)

The movie follows the garden-variety teen formula, where the nice girl learns to be true to her mom and her friends and herself and the mean girl is told off (with perhaps the greatest line in the history of teen movies: ""B-T-W, your lip gloss is soooo not glossy anymore!"")

Even though Camp Rock's DVD includes one disc; there are comparatively more extras, like songs, videos and the like. What really impressed me was, believe it or not, ""How to Be a Rock Star,"" a series of mini-docs currently being promoted on the Disney Channel. What I like is that they balance material like Demi giving the impression that she's having a constant ball making the movie. That may be true, but it could also give young, impressionable kids the idea that it's a nonstop laugh-filled party to be a showbiz kid.

However, as the ""Rock Star"" segments continue, the more refreshingly straightforward they become, and the less public relations-driven they seem. Kids need to hear how much practice, school, dedication, discipline and hard, hard work all of the cast must commit to in order to make any kind of success.

It's a message rarely shown with any degree of emphasis on today's various entertainment magazine shows. Kids often see either the extreme of fun and glamour or the extreme of dysfunction. In between there are lots of people who earn what they get because they work hard. Someone actually says, ""None of these kids has any of this handed to them.""",1219795200,,2050,4.7824858757062145

Sadly the DVD version falls short in presentation.  I find it a mistake to not offer a widescreen version of the film other than Blu-Ray.  Seeing that there was only one option to purchase as a DVD, I had assumed that either both versions were on the disc or that it was just widescreen.  It was a huge disappointment to find out that the movie is only 4x3.

Long story short.  I wish I had read the details better on Amazon.  In the end I would have not purchased this and just let the kids continue to watch the HD version we recorded on the DVR with commercials.

3167179,3,B001725ZDC,"Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) is a high school student who writes her own songs.  Her dream is to spend her summer at Camp Rock, a summer camp for musicians of all stripes.  Things don't look good until her mother (Maria Canals-Barrera) lands a job as the camp cook.  True, Mitchie has to help out around the kitchen, but she'll still get to attend most of the functions.

On the first day, she sees Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin), the daughter of multi-Grammy award winning pop artist TJ Tyler.  Tyler is the most popular girl at camp, and in an effort to impress her, she lies about her mother's job.

Meanwhile, Mitchie also meets Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), the difficult member of the group Connect 3 (the other two members of the group are played by Kevin and Nick Jonas).  Shane has been roped into teaching at the camp to rehabilitate his image.  Mitchie makes an impression on him.  But what will happen when her lies become common knowledge?

Disney's attempt to create another musical franchise almost works.  The music is pretty good here and ranges from pop to rock to hip hop.  I'm willing to forgive the illogical backup singers during some of the musical numbers (like when Shane is singing alone at the lake) since these were obviously intended to be radio singles as well as musical numbers.  The acting is good.  And the setting is absolutely fun.

However, the story just doesn't work for me.  Maybe it's because I have always been too independent, but watching Mitchie keep lying to maintain a friendship with the most obviously two faced girl in the world wasn't believable.  In fact, it bothered me that it took so long for some of the others to see through Tess as well.  And the climax just felt too rushed.

The idea behind this movie was good.  And the music is decent.  But the story just doesn't do it for me.",1219104000,7,1836,4.570552147239264
3167180,5,B001725ZDC,"After the huge Success of the High School Musical series, it appeared that musicals were ""hip"" again with the tween audience. With that idea in mind, Disney launched a new musical movie series in the summer of 2008 called ""Camp Rock"", starring Demi Lovato, The Jonas Brothers, Alyson Stoner, and Meaghan Jette Martin.

Did Camp Rock work? Absolutely! Although a bit more mean spirited and adult themed than the High School Musical series, Disney still pulled off a charming movie that while entertains, it also teaches valuables lessons to its target audience. The Disney Company has found another success with a new cast of actors and actresses. Demi Lovato is a great asset to Disney's already amazing cast of tween stars, and supporting cast members. Alyson Stoner and Meaghan Jette Martin held their own which proves they could carry any upcoming Disney Channel movies on their own.

The Camp Rock extended edition DVD contains the full screen version (1.33:1) of the film (for the wide screen version pick up Camp Rock Blu-ray edition) and a plethora of extra features including a behind the scenes look at the filming of the movie, along with music videos, sing a longs, and ""Camp Rock Karaoke""

3167184,5,B001725ZDC,"This movie is filled with the loveable and teen sensation, Jonas Brothers, plus some rockin' music, and teen rivalry. I totally love this movie, I've seen it like 5 times. Im fourteen, and I must say, the Jonas Brothers are un-unloveable in this movie. Kevin Jonas is especially funny with his famous ""group hug"" and the famous ""Can you make me a birdhouse?"" line. I love the relationship with Mitchie (Demi Lovato) and Shane (Joe Jonas - adorable!). Shane seems to become less of a pain when Mitchie steps down to him in the kitchen when he barged in demanding his allergy list. Anyway, bottom line, this movie is totally better than High School Musical, and its my personal fave because of the Jonas Brothers.",1215734400,,711,4.696
3167185,3,B001725ZDC,"Let me start by saying I am a fan of DCOM movies and since they announced this one I couldn't wait to see it, but I guess I got carried away by the trailer than the real thing. When I saw the movie I was indeed dissapointed. The acting is not so good and the music is OK but nothing special. The charm felt for high school musical is barely seen and felt with this one. This is NO competion for HSM, in HSm the music, dancing and acting is WAY better. The Jonas brothers, Nick and Joe do an ok job at the acting but Kevin can't act! Sorry to all the fans but don't get carried away just because you like them. Demi Lovato was really good. Her acting was Ok but she totally blew me away with her singing...she defenetly is an artist to look out for. What I also didn't like was the way they cut down some musical numbers. For ex. ""What it takes"" is lame and the actrice that sings is it terrible as well as the song and still they left the entire song. On the other hand we have We rock, whichc personally I think is the best song on the soundtrack and could have been a great number and what? They cut it down! This was suppose to be a ""musical"" and in a way it isn't! just kids singing in a show is not a musical! This could have been a great movie but even the story line is weak and unoriginal. If they make a squel of this I hope it has better music, better story line and give the cast acting lessons! We all know this movie has ratings because of the Jonas brothers but not because of it's quality as a good movie. High School musical still reigns the DCOMS as the best ever. Now that is a musical to look out for! HSM 3 in theaters Oct. 24 2008!",1215388800,4,1652,3.963963963963964
3167186,1,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock was an immense disappointment. I went into it expecting something a la High School Musical (a personal favorite of mine). Unfortunately, this isn't even in the same universe as High School Musical. Demi Lovato, the main character, seems like a nice girl. Who can't act. And can barely sing. Miley Cyrus could've done far more with the role- and that's saying a lot. The story failed to capture my interest, and the songs... ugh. Unlistenable garbage. Hold out for High School Musical 3 and let Camp Rock pass by you. If we're lucky, maybe the sequel will be the less we'll ever hear of these less-than-rock-ers.",1214438400,9,621,4.7592592592592595
3401563,5,B001725ZDC,Caamp Rock is a fantastic Disney Hit! The  only thing is they lip sync and it so clear they are because They either are lip syncing to fast or they are lip sycing to slow to the words. I know it is their voices though. Still. Camp Rock is very cool and Very awsome!,1214352000,,265,3.9074074074074074
3401564,4,B001725ZDC,"Can't help but think of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL while watching CAMP ROCK, but it has some charms of its own and it isn't EXACTLY a cookie cutter replica of the two HSM movies--though I will say that setting it in a summer camp for musicians is a tiny bit like the setting of the second HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, especially the many scenes of HSM2 and CAMP ROCK set in the institutional kitchens while cooking and washing dishes and peeling potatoes for 100s of people--OK, those scenes were the same.

Except that in HSM2 Gabriella did not have to be pretend to be a rich spoiled daughter of a Japanese CEO, and she did not have to lie about her mother being a cook.  That makes the new picture a little bid sadder and a little bit more serious, because Mitchie definitely has mother-daughter shame issues.  Sort of like Susan Kohner did in the Douglas Sirk version of IMITATION OF LIFE, Mitchie is bitterly ashamed to have a mother who cooks for a living and works at ""Connie's Catering Company.""

By the way, all the food Connie makes in the movie looks fantastic, especially the cupcakes and those fake CDs covered with icing!  Disney should put together a ""Connie's Catering Cookbook,"" to showcase some of the wonderful food featured in CAMP ROCK.  I'm surprised the students weren't super fat getting to sample Connie's delicious wares.  Instead they're fairly slim, especially the two rapping dance boys who get to lead the Hasta la Vista crew.

But the music is the important thing.  There aren't any numbers as catchy as the songs in HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL or as ""What Time Is It?"" in HSM 2, but give them time, they will grow on you.  The horrible blonde Tess Tyler actually gets to sing two of the better numbers in the score, ""Too Cool for You"" and her finale with all the mirrors, and most of the kids get to chime in here and there.  Demi Lovato as Mitchie Torres is cute in a Mary Diaz way, but she smiles way too much!  While we watched the movie at my apartment, a crowd of grownups gathered with a big quart of Scotch and we were told to take a drink every time Mitchie shows that appealing grin, and everyone was drunk within the first twenty minutes.  She's wonderful in the part (especially in the sad moments) but, enough with the choppers, Demi!  Two of us had an argument about the young actress, and one said that her resemblance to Demi Moore was so strong she must be the daughter of the veteran star from the 1980s and 1990s.

But I think of her as her own creation, and she's very believable.  As Shane Gray, the bad boy rock star, Joe Jonas wires the floor with Zac Efron.  His big bushy black eyebrows look like crows feathers--feathers form a 600 pound crow.  How does he even see out from under those brows?  Maybe that's why his gaze seems fixed to the ground, as though he were a shy wallflower.  The other two brothers have regular eyebrows, it's just Joe who's had the brow transplants I guess.  He is sort of like John Cuaack, if Cusack had any sex appeal, and sort of like Joe D'Allesandro, if the latter were a topnotch rock musician.  Anyhow Mitchie and Shane have a lot of chemistry, and I think should somehow be incorporated (or promoted) into the upcoming big screen HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3 SENIOR YEAR.",1214265600,,3233,4.4718909710391825
3401565,5,B001725ZDC,I am a 33 single mom of two.  My daugter is 11 and son 9.  They absolutely loved it.  My daughter is a HSM fanatic and she said this was better.  Myself admitting I loved it too!  For the fact here are The Jonas Bros attempting acting. They are prof musicians and singers. So to step out and try acting and dancing was great. Then to bring in Demi Levato so fresh and talented. Kudos! The movie kept to plot and dialog without drowning you in song after song. They were placed perfectly. We watched it days earlier on Disney on Demand and since then I think all three of us have caught it all weekend on every place it was shown. All in all I think we have watched it 10 times thanks to DVR!  We really loved it and hope for a return.,1214179200,3,734,4.027586206896552
3401566,4,B001725ZDC,My nine year old loves the Jonas Brothers and this CD was an instant hit.  All the hits from the recently released Camp Rock movie.,1214006400,2,131,4.24
3401567,5,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock is the new Disney summer teen musical & it rocks. The story centers on Mitchie- an ordinary girl who thinks she has to lie to fit in with the cool girls at an exclusive camp dedicated to talented young rockers. Over the course of the movie she learns from friends including a hunky young rockstar & enemies that all she needs to succeed is to be herself!
  It a great message for all young people  but I thinks its the wonderful performance of Demi Lovato as Mitchie & Joe Jonas as the rockstar & the great musical numbers that everybody will really love!
  I should note that Nick & Kevin  Jonas appear in the movie in smaller  supporting roles and do very well. The Jonas Brothers perform a couple songs in the movie and they are great!
  I just saw the movie last nigh & can not wait to see it again!
  The DVD provides an alternate ending and tips from cast members on how to be a rock star. I am, sure the DVD will be worth owning!",1214006400,7,946,4.171270718232044
3401568,5,B001725ZDC,"I must say, I initially wanted to watch this movie simply because of my obsession with the Jonas Brothers. About one minute into the movie, though, I completely forgot about their upcoming appearance and was dazzled by Demi Lovato, who plays a girl named Mitchee who has an incredible voice but is afraid to let people know. One thing I liked about this film was that Mitchee actually was afraid of singing in front of an audience, and didn't just say she was scared and then proceed to belt out a song; rather, she sang quietly at first, eyes on the floor. This made her character extremely relatable and I even surprised myself by feeling my heart start to race when she was about to perform- I was actually nervous for her! It takes talent for an actress to be able to make her audience feel right there with her the whole time, and Demi Lovato certainly has a bright future. Her voice is incredible, and she's a wonderful young actress too, not overacting or acting and doing things a person in the real world wouldn't, as so many Disney stars do these days.
  The Jonas Brothers were also great, but I was surprised and disappointed that Nick and Kevin weren't in the movie much. In fact, I remember thinking half way through, ""where are those two Jonas boys? They've had only one scene and it's halfway through the movie already!"" Joe surprised me too by being a great actor! During the movie, I admit, I never thought of him as Joe Jonas, but rather, Shane Gray.
  Overall, Disney definitely has created another smash hit with ""Camp Rock."" Unlike in other Disney flicks like High School Musical, when some of the girls in this movie get bullied, they get angry rather than shrinking away and moping. One of my favorite scenes, though I won't give anything away, was when one girl got fed up with being treated horribly and rounded on the blond girl, actually yelling at her. Imagine that, yelling in a Disney movie! It was refreshing! The emotions were real, as they were throughout, another thing great about this movie. So, the acting was very, very good, the voices of Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas were outstanding (and I wish I could underline and bold the word ""outstanding""!) and five minutes after watching this on Disney Channel, I find myself wanting to watch it again!
I will definitely be buying this, and I recommend it to everyone, despite whether or not you're a Disney fan. This story is believable, fun to watch, and will leave you craving more!

~a 16 Year old~

P.S. I will admit, it did seem a bit rushed towards the end, but that's not enough of a complaint to dwell on.",1213920000,7,2594,4.54389721627409
3401569,4,B001725ZDC,"My children and I were lucky enough to see this movie a little early due to the fact that it was on Disney On Demand.  Good entertaining movie for the family.  I gave it 4 stars, because I thought it was a little short and could have used a little more substance to the story.  It seemed to have just raced through to the end.  I don't want to ruin the story for everyone, but the music was good and there were some cute parts.  Flour in the face, slipping on the floor and the poor brother with his birdhouse obsession.  I was disappointed that the other Jonas brothers weren't part of the main story, but rather made cameo appearances.  Mitchie and Shane were really cute together and I am glad she put him in his place, because he started out as a real jerk.  I loved their duet together at the end where they put their two different songs together and made it flow as one.  The end was surpising to my children because the person who won the contest was not who they thought it would be.  All in all the kids loved the music and really enjoyed the movie and already they have watched it over and over.

1st: I am a fan of Demi Lovato. But NOT in this movie. Nope. Nope. NOPE.
2nd: Jonas Brothers add a good dynamic to the cast, but the mini plot thing they had going on within their 3 characters was iffy at best.
3rd: The songs are annoying at best, and sort of make the movie seem more like a musical than a movie. And not in a good way.

3401629,3,B001725ZDC,"This movie is typical in just about every way. It has its moments but generally goes for the predictable. Demi plays Mitchie, a cute girl that's very insecure about her life up until now. She enters Camp Rock and meets a couple of girls, one of which who is the snotty, uppity type. Typically, they are rich and she is not and Mitchie tries to be like them and lies a whole lot through the movie to prove that she indeed is like them. Joe Jonas (who plays Shane) and his brothers (save for the younger, less famous Jonas) are in the movie. Joe is the only main character of the brothers however and is endowed the role of the rebellious celebrity. He's at Camp Rock (which he used to attend like Demi) this time as a dance instructor. Through most of the movie he has a bad attitude. It isn't until he hears Demi's character sing a beautiful, inspirational tune that his character starts to change for the better.

Overall, the movie was OK. It has life lessons on how not to be ashamed of where you come from and to follow your dreams. Typical? Yes. But not so bad for the younger audience who could have these values instilled as a reminder. I liked it enough and I'm 27. Hopefully, the younger crowd sticks this one out. Demi does a LOT of lying for a while and doesn't actually stop until she gets caught in her lies pretty much. If anything is taken from this movie it should be the fact that we should all stay true to ourselves.

3401636,2,B001725ZDC,"I will say this right off the bat: this movie is a disappointment. Let's start with the plot.
A young aspiring musician goes to a camp filled with other musically-inclined artists. At Camp Rock, they will harness and expand their ""talents"" (talents which include singing as though they will have an asthma attack any second, and thinking they can dance when they can't). The girl works part-time in the kitchen to pay for her stay, something she keeps from the other campers. At the camp, she meets a teen rocker-idol who is there for punishment (yeah, staying there would DEFINITELY be a punishment). Apparently, his attitude has gotten him into trouble with his bandmates and he needs to cool off. The girl changes the boy over the course of the movie. They fight. The girl does not win the big competition at the end of camp (didn't see that one coming. The main character doesn't win?) Girl and boy make up. The End.
Now let's talk about the music. For the most part, the music is basically rap/hip-hop. As mentioned above, the singing doesn't even make up for the terrible tunes.
If the plotline and characters had been developed a bit more, this might have been a fairly decent film. The only good parts are when all three Jonas brothers are together. They play off each other and deliver their comical lines well. Sadly, the five good minutes when they're all together do not make up for the other 85 that do not include Kevin and Nick.
Final word: skip this movie and watch High School Musical instead.",1273708800,,1510,4.638059701492537
3401637,5,B001725ZDC,"it was entertaining, and showed how teens are in feal life, with popularity and all that i found it was really  enjoyable",1272758400,,121,4.5

3401639,4,B001725ZDC,"While I'm far from the target audience, I must confess that I've watched some of the current Disney Channel shows and found them quite entertaining. With their Original movies, is another story. Most of those I've seen I found plain, uninteresting and didn't exactly brought my desire to support Disney's profitable (and somewhat desperate) marketing of their newest products, which High School Musical is a clearly example of (although Hannah Montana goes into the same category too, at least it isn't an DC Original movie). When I first heard about Camp Rock, my thoughts were that this was just another soulless attempt to profitable marketing, which it somehow is. But one evening I randomly watched this movie on Disney Channel and I was surprised over finding the movie quite enjoyable and watchable.

The only component I enjoyed about the High School Musical flicks were the songs. Camp Rock is slightly better in many ways. First of all, it has a better story. While there's nothing innovative or groundbreaking about the plot, the story still unfolds nicely throughout the movie and it's a component that actually works. And overall, I felt Camp Rock had more heart and soul than the soulless and bland High School Musical trilogy.

Second, the overall cast are more likeable and not a bunch of intrusive wannabes as the HSM cast. While none of the acting is Oscar-worthy, the cast delivers decent performances without overacting. Demi Lovato portrays Mitchie as a sweet, but insecure and identity-searching girl, without giving the character some real substance. In comparison to Lovato's latest projects, as Sonny With A Chance and Princess Protection Programme, she has definitively improved her acting skills since Camp Rock. Perhaps this is unfair to her, but considering that she's marketed as the competitor of Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez, a comparison is inevitable and Lovato struggles to distinguish herself from her rivals. While she's indeed talented, she doesn't have the it factor and star potential that characterizes both Cyrus and Gomez. In spite of that, Lovato does have the best singing voice of the trio, which she proves both in the movie itself and on the bonus features.

Another surprise comes from Joe Jonas, who plays the apparently unlikeable, but misunderstood rock star Shane Gray. Although Mr. Jonas is far from a versatile actor, his role as a torn celebrity gives the film some weight and depth. Other noteworthy performances come from Alyson Stoner as Mitchie's likeable friend Caytlin Geller, Meaghan Jette Martin as Tess Tyler and Daniel Fathers as the British camp leader Brown Cesario. Fans of Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana will notice the appearances of cast members from each of the shows.

Another good component is the music, which is overall listenable and catchy. Just as High School Musical, this is a musical where people randomly break into song, but the numbers never feels out place. The songs are fun and enjoyable, especially Mitchie's big solo number This Is Me and the final jam song We Rock at the end. By the way, this DVD contains a extra song number, which is called Our Time Is Here, which is passable enough, but nothing beyond that.

If there's something to complain about Camp Rock, it would be that some of the final conclusions feels somewhat rushed and leaves again some questions, but it doesn't ruin the overall impression of this movie.

BONUS FEATURES.
The bonus features are divided into two sections, which is Music and More and Backstage Disney. While the former mostly includes more or less the same musical sequences of the film, just with lyrics on screen, the real interesting features lies on the Backstage Disney section.

First up is a own section which is called How to be a rock star, which contains seven shorts. All can be played together into a 27:54 minutes featurette (which is actually recommended, for the continuity and cohesiveness of the feature). The video features interviews from the cast and directors and while some of context is somewhat preachy and aimed for kids (at least those over eight), it's still pretty informative, entertaining and not so fluffy to scare away an adult audience. The whole crew comes off as sympathetic, likeable and enthusiastic, so watching the interviews with them is a blast.

Next up is a fifteen minutes and fourty-five seconds featurette Jonas Brothers: Real Life Rock Stars, which is an insightful and interesting featurette portraying the brothers busy life. The siblings appear as nice and grounded guys and their hardcore fans will most likely love this.

Afterwards comes the Introducing Demi Lovato (5:40) featurette, which is rather more brief comparing to the two former featurettes, but still informative. This inside-scoop with Demi is about her interest in music and her experience with making this movie and Demi comes off as a shy, but likeable girl.

Camp Memories (5:49) is probably the most disappointing featurette on this DVD. With the exception of two brief video shots, this featurette is rather like a slideshow reel with personal photos taken by the cast and crew.

Hasta la vista: From rehearsal to final Jam (4:55) is the insight of the making of Hasta la Vista musical number and cast members Jordan Francis and Roshon Fegan gets interviews and sing as well. A cute short, but brief.

Too Cool: Setting the Scene (3:37) is about the preparation about Tess' big musical number Too Cool and has brief interviews with some of the girls in the cast. Actually a little more technical and informative than the Hasta la Vista featurette, but also too brief.

Overall, this is what you get by the Camp Rock DVD. The movie itself is actually pretty cute and entertaining. It may be silly to recommend a Disney Channel Original Movie so warmly, but Camp Rock is really worth a watch, in my opinion and it's better than HSM and even Hannah Montana The Movie.

When it comes to the overall judgment of the Bonus Features, I find it somewhat odd that a so heavily marketed product film doesn't include more extras, but the final featurettes are mostly enjoyable and watchable and will definitively please the fans.",1266624000,,6180,4.9815712900097

Anyways, i saw it on TV and put songs from it on my Zune, and I still can't get enough of it. It's catchy and fun, and it tells the truth about trying to fit in as a teenager(and of course how lying about who you are will bite you in the butt). Demi Lovato is a really great actress, and she sure has a set of pipes on her (man she can sing!!).

3401642,1,B001725ZDC,"""Camp Rock"" is more like ""Camp Crude.""  I hoped it would channel some of the energy and zest of High School Musical, but it was HSM's weak, mean-spirited shadow and lacked the Disney touch.  A few examples: When the heroine reveals that she lied by glamorizing her parents to fit in, she never apologizes to the group she's deceived, no one steps forward to reassure her that bucks and bling aren't what's really important, and her Mom doesn't mind at all  that her daughter is blisteringly ashamed of their family.  Kids repeatedly call each other ""jerk.""  The bad girl is shallow and just plain mean, with none of the comic genius that Ashley Tisdale brought to the parallel role in HSM.

The big dance numbers that played so well in HSM's expansive cafeteria and hallway scenes are here dampened by the confines of low-roofed camp mess halls, and there's not a song you'll be singing the next day.

The film itself is typical for a DCOM movie. But, it has a sort of charm that manages to make you smile after a long day. The cast works well together, though there were some plot points that seemed overlooked, and others that they spent too much time going through. Apart from Joe, the rest of the Brothers don't have much of a part, and seem thrown in only as an afterthought.

The music is similar to what you'd expect in ""High School Musical"". It's catchy and upbeat, and chances are you'll have at least one of the songs stuck in your head for a few days after the viewing.

All in all, it's a delightful film. There isn't anything crude in it, and the lyrics are clean. I'd highly recommend it to anybody who just wants a sweet family-friendly popcorn flick to pass an evening. :)",1236729600,2,986,4.43646408839779

3401668,3,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock was heavily advertised on Disney Channel Asia as THE greatest DCOM yet.. and thinking HSM got me hooked, I thought Camp Rock might do the same. Plus I adore Demi Lovato however, I'm not a fan of Jonas Brothers but lucky for me, only the cute one Joe is in the movie and Nick and Kevin appeared for few minutes.. and Kevin being the dumb Jonas in the movie is ridiculous and annoying.

Storyline...wait what story? Haven't I seen hundreds of movies with the same storyline before? Girl lies to fit in, girl meets boy and two gets attracted to each other, rival reveals the truth, everyone briefly hates the girl, girl realize her mistake.. then they live happily ever after. Oh so typical. It's very predictable since the beginning of the movie.

The story bored me. I was not interested at all. It was nothing new. Plus lots of plot holes which I'm not gonna dwell into as it could take ages to write. Only part worth watching is the final jam. Songs? I was expecting something like HSM but what the heck? The only good song that I like is This Is me/Gotta Find You when Mitchie sings with Shane at the end and that's it... cast is very forgettable, songs are not that catchy and very forgettable.. dance moves are all over the place and doesn't match..

Even though I adore Demi, she cannot dance! It was a pain watching her sing and dance to her song because she overdo it. Overall, it's just an ok movie. The majority who thinks the movie rocks are Jonas Brothers fans.. they don't care if the movie sucks, they just wanna see The Jonas Brothers.. and that's how Disney sell the movie - by featuring Jonas Brothers as if they're the lead characters when they're just supporting and don't appear much. The DVD cover is so misleading. The story is more on conflict of Mitchie, Tess & Caitlyn.. Mitchie & Shane has chemistry, but eh... they didn't make it interesting at all... unlike in HSM with Troy & Gabriella...

Good try but uh no thanks, I'll stick to HSM.",1220745600,4,1973,4.457063711911357
3401669,4,B001725ZDC,"This is a Disney Channel Original Movie, so don't go into it expecting anything too much in the way of a plot.  The sitcom-type story is supported (and padded) by a full soundtrack of tween pop music and dancing, and touches on many of the issues facing the target age group, namely fitting in, peer pressure, un-cool and too-cool parents, jealousy, and last but not least, loving the Jonas Brothers.

Tween idol Joe Jonas plays the leading man, a young pop star who's been behaving badly, and gets sentenced to teaching dance classes at an upscale summer camp for musicians.  The other Jonas brothers also play supporting roles, and perform a couple of songs at the camp.

Demi Lovato plays the female lead, a promising singer/songwriter whose mother takes a catering job at the camp so that she can afford the fees.  There's also the rich girl, played by Meaghan Jette Martin, and her obligatory two henchgirls; the usual outcast who befriends the new girl (well played by Alyson Stoner), and the well intentioned Camp Director.  Add some supporting singers and dancers, and a ready group of back-up dancers, and you have (drum roll) Camp Rock.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Girl goes to camp and meets boy
2. Girl messes up big time
3. This is a Disney movie, so after the song and dance, everyone lives happily ever after.

While I recognize the age-appropriate manner in which the movie addresses certain issues, the wrapping up happens far too quickly to be even remotely believable, but then, the target audience probably isn't paying too much attention to the story anyway.

I've seen girls doing the ""I'm not worthy"" bow in front of posters for this movie, so I'm guessing that it would be a good gift for any fan of the Jonas Brothers on your list.

3401671,4,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock was so long anticipated for its Disney Channel premiere that, as far as the local kids were concerned, the world stopped turning that evening. Though it's sort of being sold as a Jonas movie, it's really a vehicle for up-and-coming young star Demi Lovato and ""ouch he's sooooooo keee-uwww-te!"" Joe Jonas. His brothers have marginal roles, reportedly due to Joe's insistence they be included. Demi has that Sally Field winsomeness down pat -- ABC should have no trouble recasting if they ever bring back The Flying Nun. (Seriously, which Saint can I pray to for that? I loved that show.)

The movie follows the garden-variety teen formula, where the nice girl learns to be true to her mom and her friends and herself and the mean girl is told off (with perhaps the greatest line in the history of teen movies: ""B-T-W, your lip gloss is soooo not glossy anymore!"")

Even though Camp Rock's DVD includes one disc; there are comparatively more extras, like songs, videos and the like. What really impressed me was, believe it or not, ""How to Be a Rock Star,"" a series of mini-docs currently being promoted on the Disney Channel. What I like is that they balance material like Demi giving the impression that she's having a constant ball making the movie. That may be true, but it could also give young, impressionable kids the idea that it's a nonstop laugh-filled party to be a showbiz kid.

However, as the ""Rock Star"" segments continue, the more refreshingly straightforward they become, and the less public relations-driven they seem. Kids need to hear how much practice, school, dedication, discipline and hard, hard work all of the cast must commit to in order to make any kind of success.

It's a message rarely shown with any degree of emphasis on today's various entertainment magazine shows. Kids often see either the extreme of fun and glamour or the extreme of dysfunction. In between there are lots of people who earn what they get because they work hard. Someone actually says, ""None of these kids has any of this handed to them.""",1219795200,,2050,4.7824858757062145

Sadly the DVD version falls short in presentation.  I find it a mistake to not offer a widescreen version of the film other than Blu-Ray.  Seeing that there was only one option to purchase as a DVD, I had assumed that either both versions were on the disc or that it was just widescreen.  It was a huge disappointment to find out that the movie is only 4x3.

Long story short.  I wish I had read the details better on Amazon.  In the end I would have not purchased this and just let the kids continue to watch the HD version we recorded on the DVR with commercials.

3401676,3,B001725ZDC,"Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) is a high school student who writes her own songs.  Her dream is to spend her summer at Camp Rock, a summer camp for musicians of all stripes.  Things don't look good until her mother (Maria Canals-Barrera) lands a job as the camp cook.  True, Mitchie has to help out around the kitchen, but she'll still get to attend most of the functions.

On the first day, she sees Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin), the daughter of multi-Grammy award winning pop artist TJ Tyler.  Tyler is the most popular girl at camp, and in an effort to impress her, she lies about her mother's job.

Meanwhile, Mitchie also meets Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), the difficult member of the group Connect 3 (the other two members of the group are played by Kevin and Nick Jonas).  Shane has been roped into teaching at the camp to rehabilitate his image.  Mitchie makes an impression on him.  But what will happen when her lies become common knowledge?

Disney's attempt to create another musical franchise almost works.  The music is pretty good here and ranges from pop to rock to hip hop.  I'm willing to forgive the illogical backup singers during some of the musical numbers (like when Shane is singing alone at the lake) since these were obviously intended to be radio singles as well as musical numbers.  The acting is good.  And the setting is absolutely fun.

However, the story just doesn't work for me.  Maybe it's because I have always been too independent, but watching Mitchie keep lying to maintain a friendship with the most obviously two faced girl in the world wasn't believable.  In fact, it bothered me that it took so long for some of the others to see through Tess as well.  And the climax just felt too rushed.

The idea behind this movie was good.  And the music is decent.  But the story just doesn't do it for me.",1219104000,7,1836,4.570552147239264
3401677,5,B001725ZDC,"After the huge Success of the High School Musical series, it appeared that musicals were ""hip"" again with the tween audience. With that idea in mind, Disney launched a new musical movie series in the summer of 2008 called ""Camp Rock"", starring Demi Lovato, The Jonas Brothers, Alyson Stoner, and Meaghan Jette Martin.

Did Camp Rock work? Absolutely! Although a bit more mean spirited and adult themed than the High School Musical series, Disney still pulled off a charming movie that while entertains, it also teaches valuables lessons to its target audience. The Disney Company has found another success with a new cast of actors and actresses. Demi Lovato is a great asset to Disney's already amazing cast of tween stars, and supporting cast members. Alyson Stoner and Meaghan Jette Martin held their own which proves they could carry any upcoming Disney Channel movies on their own.

The Camp Rock extended edition DVD contains the full screen version (1.33:1) of the film (for the wide screen version pick up Camp Rock Blu-ray edition) and a plethora of extra features including a behind the scenes look at the filming of the movie, along with music videos, sing a longs, and ""Camp Rock Karaoke""

This film is a great addition to the latest lineup of classic Disney Channel movies, and if you still don't have your fill of Camp Rock after your finished watching the DVD, don't worry -- a sequel is already in the works.",1219017600,12,1424,4.827868852459017
3401678,1,B001725ZDC,"Ewwwwwww!

This movie is so bad!!! The story sucks. The acting and NO GOOD. I would never pay money for this. I would not even pay $0.01 for it. They could not even give this movie away its so bad.

The songs suck and that Demi Lovato girl needs to shut up. Though the movie you will think why do you even talk? As for the Jonas Brothers. What the crap is the big deal? I see nothing amazing about um! They sing like they are forcing it out! As for acting? Well boys just keep trying to sing, acting is not for you.

The rest of the cast is just as forgettable as the leads. I'll still trying to forget the leads. Everyone seems like they know how bad the movie is and just give up during the movie.

The songs are forgettable and nothing stands out its just hard to sit through.

If you want a good Rock Musical watch The American Mall!!!!!",1218585600,4,841,4.072727272727272
3401679,4,B001725ZDC,"This movie was pretty good, I would of liked for there to be more of all 3 Jonas Brothers in the movie but it was pretty good.  It was sad but then it comes back with an okay ending.  I think the ending could have been better but the overall movie was good.",1217203200,,257,3.830188679245283
3401680,5,B001725ZDC,"I love this movie, and not only because it has the Jonas Brothers. It has everything a kid could want in a movie. It's funny, sad, and makes you want to jump out of your seat and dance. This is the single most best Disney movie EVER!",1216080000,,233,3.978723404255319
3401681,5,B001725ZDC,"This movie is filled with the loveable and teen sensation, Jonas Brothers, plus some rockin' music, and teen rivalry. I totally love this movie, I've seen it like 5 times. Im fourteen, and I must say, the Jonas Brothers are un-unloveable in this movie. Kevin Jonas is especially funny with his famous ""group hug"" and the famous ""Can you make me a birdhouse?"" line. I love the relationship with Mitchie (Demi Lovato) and Shane (Joe Jonas - adorable!). Shane seems to become less of a pain when Mitchie steps down to him in the kitchen when he barged in demanding his allergy list. Anyway, bottom line, this movie is totally better than High School Musical, and its my personal fave because of the Jonas Brothers.",1215734400,,711,4.696
3401682,3,B001725ZDC,"Let me start by saying I am a fan of DCOM movies and since they announced this one I couldn't wait to see it, but I guess I got carried away by the trailer than the real thing. When I saw the movie I was indeed dissapointed. The acting is not so good and the music is OK but nothing special. The charm felt for high school musical is barely seen and felt with this one. This is NO competion for HSM, in HSm the music, dancing and acting is WAY better. The Jonas brothers, Nick and Joe do an ok job at the acting but Kevin can't act! Sorry to all the fans but don't get carried away just because you like them. Demi Lovato was really good. Her acting was Ok but she totally blew me away with her singing...she defenetly is an artist to look out for. What I also didn't like was the way they cut down some musical numbers. For ex. ""What it takes"" is lame and the actrice that sings is it terrible as well as the song and still they left the entire song. On the other hand we have We rock, whichc personally I think is the best song on the soundtrack and could have been a great number and what? They cut it down! This was suppose to be a ""musical"" and in a way it isn't! just kids singing in a show is not a musical! This could have been a great movie but even the story line is weak and unoriginal. If they make a squel of this I hope it has better music, better story line and give the cast acting lessons! We all know this movie has ratings because of the Jonas brothers but not because of it's quality as a good movie. High School musical still reigns the DCOMS as the best ever. Now that is a musical to look out for! HSM 3 in theaters Oct. 24 2008!",1215388800,4,1652,3.963963963963964
3401683,1,B001725ZDC,"Camp Rock was an immense disappointment. I went into it expecting something a la High School Musical (a personal favorite of mine). Unfortunately, this isn't even in the same universe as High School Musical. Demi Lovato, the main character, seems like a nice girl. Who can't act. And can barely sing. Miley Cyrus could've done far more with the role- and that's saying a lot. The story failed to capture my interest, and the songs... ugh. Unlistenable garbage. Hold out for High School Musical 3 and let Camp Rock pass by you. If we're lucky, maybe the sequel will be the less we'll ever hear of these less-than-rock-ers.",1214438400,9,621,4.7592592592592595

The acting is terrible and their singing and music is terrible and all of it is terrible! There are WAY BETTER Disney movies out there such as Cars 3, Avengers, Toy Story, Big hero 6, Star Wars; which are all infinitely better and REAL disney movies unlike this garbage right here. If this movie was to be released in theaters back in '08, it should've been either rated R or NC-17. All you Disney fans like I am, please do yourselves a favor and skip this one!
