4463250,5,B004SKETX2,"I just love all of Anson's work, I really think he did a great job playing this drug addict, it made you want to hate him. So I feel acting the part was done very well!",1354752000,,168,3.6944444444444446
4463251,5,B004SKETX2,"By the brief description of the movie I was kinda put off but I decided I wanted to give this one a shot anyway and I am very glad I did. The acting is wonderful, very gritty film.. you can tell its a bit low budget but its still shot real well. Definitely one worth watching!!",1353888000,,277,3.9642857142857144
4463252,5,B004SKETX2,"I just saw this film and knew when I chose to watch that it wouldn't be easy. I wish that this could be shown to teens. Sort of a ""scared straight"" variation on the Anti-Drug campaign that we were flooded with in the early 1970's as pre-teens.
My question is....does the father, Sonny go BACK to jail at the end?? It is IMPLIED....Worth watching. Crystal Meth is such a toxic chemical drug that is next to IMPOSSIBLE to kick from what I understand, and the health hazards (What it does to teeth, lungs, internal organs. Look at the chemicals it's made with!!!) Great film.",1353801600,8,572,4.509615384615385
4463253,5,B004SKETX2,"Very scary-bad (emotional) movie, but incredible acting from all; I destroyed a shirt from clenching/unclenching fabric too tight and was weeping by end of movie. Couldn't recommend to all my friends because subject matter way too visceral for some people (although very true life, I believe). Anson Mount is one of this household's favorite actors; truly wishing/praying Hell On Wheels returns for 3rd season. Highest rating given.",1353283200,,432,5.462686567164179

4463255,5,B004SKETX2,"This was one of the best movies I've seen lately.  Anson Mount, Xander Berkeley & the young man who played Xander's son were nothing short of perfection in portraying the life - and fallout - of a methhead and his extended family.

Rent this movie if you can find it. You won't be disappointed.",1344729600,2,294,4.425925925925926
4463256,5,B004SKETX2,The movie was a  very believable account of the meth addict. I understand Mr. Mount interviewed real meth addicts for his chilling roll of Bump! Well done!,1340841600,2,155,4.7407407407407405
4463257,5,B004SKETX2,One of the best depictions of drug life and the struggles that lie within.  Will definitely keep you engrossed while wanting to look away at times.  NOT FOR CHILDREN,1340236800,,165,4.655172413793103
4463258,5,B004SKETX2,"This movie has it all...great cast, good story, gritty look at drug life. Kept my attention all the way through until the end.
Plus..Anson Mount really ""owns"" this role. One of his best ever!",1337299200,14,191,4.647058823529412
4463259,5,B004SKETX2,"Very real and raw look at a family buried in drugs.  Anson Mount gave a unforgettable performance as a crack addict. As in most addicts, there is nothing more important  than the next little ""bump"". Hard to watch at some points, and be prepared for rough language. Not for the faint at heart. Another example of Anson Mount's acting chops. He was completely into this role.",1463443200,3,373,4.636363636363637

4463269,5,B004SKETX2,"Despite Anson Mount's considerable acting ability, I was prepared not to like this film because of the subject matter. However, the scourge that is meth addiction was not glossed over. I found myself engrossed in the film and the dissolution of Mount's character. There's no glorification here. Just great writing, actIng, and direction. To borrow a phrase, I give this fine drama two thumbs way up.",1436918400,,399,5.0606060606060606

4463277,2,B004SKETX2,"The movie would have been great BUT, I bought it used as there wasn't a new DVD available anywhere.  Unfortunately the DVD had two bad areas and wouldn't play correctly.  Anson Mount gave a very convincing performance.",1419552000,,218,4.864864864864865
4463278,4,B004SKETX2,Not the life that you want to live. I don't know why people stay in those depopulated hick towns under those conditions. Or why someone hits the pipe with such bleak outcomes at the end.,1417219200,,186,4.3428571428571425
4463279,5,B004SKETX2,Anson Mount was fantastic in this role.  The movie was very graphic in so far the life of a meth addict. Great movie. Great actor.,1416700800,,130,4.2

4463281,4,B004SKETX2,"I've lived in the rural southeast where people are poor, unemployed  and making meth.  This movie is hard to believe.  I think it portrays the worst possible scenario and not what occurs most often.  The acting by Mount is amazing.",1415059200,,231,4.7

4463286,5,B004SKETX2,"well written, well acted, spot on depiction of a Meth fueled hell. This movie will stick with you much like Requiem for a Dream.",1395014400,,128,4.375
4463287,5,B004SKETX2,"If you've ever been indifferent or uninformed about the human destruction caused by drug addiction.....this film is the education you need.  The acting is astounding, particularly by Mr. Mount, and the story line riveting.  It is all too real, depressing, convincing.",1393113600,,267,5.487804878048781
4463288,4,B004SKETX2,The thing I loved most about this movie is that some of it was shot on my home prairie. I felt like the actors really did their homework on the lives of small town drug addicts.,1391126400,,177,3.9444444444444446
4463289,3,B004SKETX2,"Love Anson Mount and he did a great job in this movie, but it was a little hard to realize that the selling of a child's innocence could be a reality when it comes to drug addicts.",1390262400,,180,3.891891891891892
4463290,1,B004SKETX2,"Lots of cursing and no evident plot...terrible,  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  Poor acting,  seems cheap and tawdry.",1390089600,,131,5.142857142857143
4463291,3,B004SKETX2,Very realistic portrayal of meth users and how it affects children. It was disturbing and moving. Acting was pretty good,1389830400,,120,5.05
4463292,4,B004SKETX2,The name Anson Mount drew me toward this movie. I didn't know anything about the story. I thought it was probably about Cook County IL (Chicago). Truth be told this tragic story is going on in rural areas in every state. Thumbs up!,1388448000,,231,4.395348837209302
4463293,4,B004SKETX2,"Hard to watch some scenes.  But this is a reality and very sad, especially for the children caught up in it.",1383350400,,108,4.142857142857143
4463294,5,B004SKETX2,"I'm truly amazed at how authentic, and real feeling this film was.  Could honestly pass as a documentary if one didn't know the actors, or read the summary info.  Again it's scary how close it's like watching a real life documentary that focuses on both the overall ""Meth in rural county"" type aspect, as well as the individual effects meth has on the user aspect.

Every actor that had a real part did a fantastic job, ultimately resulting in a brilliant total performance from the cast.  Again even the small stand in's had the ""authentic"" feel to them.  I enjoyed ""Hell on Wheels"" mainly because of Anson Mount, and I rented this film mainly because of his casting.....he delivered one amazing performance, and is now one of my favorite actors.  I really hope his career takes off, he must have really researched this part well, better yet methodically.  Even physically he nailed the part.

Not a huge review guy, but occasionally a film just nails it...and this one does for sure imho.

Scary authentic feel, with brilliant acting throughout, and ultimately ending with one very real subject matter portrayal.",1383177600,13,1114,4.851851851851852
4463295,5,B004SKETX2,Acting was great. Anson Mount was top notch in his role!!!! Scenes seemed so real you felt like you were in that little house!!!,1381968000,,128,4.375
4463296,4,B004SKETX2,"This was a really good movie. Probably the best acting I've seen by Anson Mount besides being Cullen Bohannon in (Hell on Wheels). Bravo! to this man. There was one thing that disturbed me toward the end of the movie but, I understand what this movie was about and what kind of character that he was portraying. Other than that this movie was good and he did a amazing job playing the role of Bump. It's one of my favorite Indy movies.",1379030400,,435,4.317073170731708
4463297,5,B004SKETX2,"Anson Mount delivers a haunting performance as his character, Bump, slides into meth-induced insanity.  Enjoyed the performances by the rest of the cast as well.",1378339200,,161,5.44
4463298,3,B004SKETX2,"I wanted to see this movie because I was curious to see Anson Mount.  I didn't know anything about the story line and only rate it as average because of the content.  The acting was great on Mount's part, as expected, but other than a vehicle for his good acting, who wants to see the gritty side of life, ironically from the comfort of home.  It took me days to stop thinking about the horrors of out of control drug usage.",1375401600,7,424,4.209876543209877
4463299,5,B004SKETX2,"When I first saw this film I was unsure how I would react. Turns out that the story is very deep along with rich characters each with their own flaws and problems as well as two youngsters just trying to survive. The story that is woven is one of sorrow, disgust, thrilling, and at last relief. A must see for those that value a true story with superb acting all around over the CG-Hollywood-Movie-Crap that is shoved down our throats at the theaters.",1373846400,8,451,4.445783132530121
4463300,5,B004SKETX2,"I found the movie very disturbing, but overall, I really liked it. I viewed it more as instructive than entertaining.  Also, it was very well made:
* Well-written script
* Good acting
* The depiction of meth life seemed very realistic
* Characters were well balanced, e.g., the bad guys were not over-the-top bad, nor cartoonish
* The way the good characters persevered was edifying

Movies about pathetic losers are usually unbearable to me, and I quickly turn those movies off (e.g., many of Nick Nolte's characters).  Somehow, this movie is different.  Although the story was disturbing, the overall tone was encouraging, e.g., the way the good guys persevered and the bad guys perished.",1371859200,7,690,5.026315789473684
4463301,5,B004SKETX2,"Excellent flick, uncomfortable subject especially if you have ever been around anyone on Crystal Meth or lived next to a Meth Lab (no joke!). Being from Texas would like to point out a ""small detail"", Cook County is actually in ""North Texas"", borders the Red River/Oklahoma, not East Texas. Wondered why they portrayed it as ""East Texas"", the scene with the Houston Police should have been the Dallas PD...so much for ""small details"". Have actually lived next door to a Meth Lab,  and the physical and mental deterioration  of the characters was right on. Normally I stay away from flicks like this or don't finish watching them, but this one held my interest all the way to the end, it doesn't come off as exploitative but empathetic, you feel the characters. Worth watching!",1371254400,,776,4.827067669172933
4463302,5,B004SKETX2,This movie is hard to watch because of its gritty subject matter.  However it is so well done and has a great cast. Anson Mount is so real and disturbing in his performance.  Just outstanding and brilliant.,1370131200,,206,4.54054054054054
4463303,4,B004SKETX2,"This is a gritty story about the depravity of meth addiction.  It's well written, and the performance by Anson Mount is not to be missed. There's no happy ending to this movie, and while it's disturbing in every possible way, it's believable and worth watching.",1366675200,,261,4.8
4463304,4,B004SKETX2,"Anson Mount delivers a despicable, tragic character and then some. There is no disputing, the story line, portraying the horrors of addiction, leaves you feeling sad, mad and dirty. The acting however, is outstanding and worth the time and rental fee.

Anson Mount fans will be left with a greater appreciation for the depth of his skill.",1363564800,2,338,4.9298245614035086
4463305,5,B004SKETX2,"The first thing I thought after I watched Cook County, was ""why didn't this film get a wider distribution?"" it is disturbing, thought provoking, well written, and well acted. David Pomes has written a cautionary tale that lets you peek inside the decaying world of crystal meth makers and addicts. CC offers an unflinching gaze at the isolated, paranoid, and ultimately sad existence of the people lost in addiction, and the desperate measures taken to leave that world. The acting is so believeable, that you will end up despising, and rooting for, the characters. This film has big impact, well after you've seen it.",1362182400,2,618,4.951923076923077
4463306,5,B004SKETX2,So good but so disturbing!!  Anson Mounts performance is amazing!!  Hard to watch at times but well worth seeing.  Anson plays a drug user that is not concerned about his nephew or his daughter and the tribulations they go through.  Not a movie for kids since there is language and a very disturbing rape but it is a movie you must not miss,1360454400,,340,4.349206349206349
4463307,5,B004SKETX2,"Simply could not abide this work of Anson Mount being left to wither and die due to having just one single review containing one single star.  The first reviewer was perhaps commenting on the depth of human depravity in this film, which is indeed abhorrent and revolting, rather than dismissing the brilliant performances that bring this all-too-real story to life.

The story, dialogue and mood of Cook County could easily be a documentary of rural East Texas drug life with it's broken, neglected children and men who've devolved into human parasites, draining the life out of all who dare to come near them.

I can testify to having witnessed the exact drug-addled ramblings of Anson Mount's addict, which he plays with such blistering reality it boggles the mind.  I cannot imagine the writer making this up, pulling only from his imagination, for these exact words are uttered inside these same filthy infested homes by these very depths of human ugliness, not just in East Texas where I saw and ran from it myself, but across the country in counties of every state.  No special effects are needed for this journey into drug hell, because the reality of this story is horrific enough on its own with no embellishment required.

Anson Mount is an actor not to be missed, an actor who cannot be ignored for he is mesmerizing on the screen.  Those in need of more from this delicious man should consider the entire Hell on Wheels series, even for those like me who are not huge fans all things Old West.  One episode in, and I was hooked nonstop until the very last scene of the very last season.

Anson Mount is magical with the ease in which he embodies his characters. I anxiously await more of his work, but this is one actor who does not accept every script that comes along, so my patience comes in knowing whatever comes next will be spectacular.",1358294400,46,1855,4.6656441717791415
4463308,5,B004SKETX2,"Well acted. Package arrived on time. But, I wasn't prepared for the movie. Whew! I am an Anson Mount fan from the new Hell on Wheels series. I know the movie was a true-to-life depiction of the lives of meth addicts. Whew! grab the tissue, and your stomach!!! What a ride.",1355961600,,272,4.352941176470588

The desperation and depravity meth addiction creates are witnessed from the perspective of the father seeking absolution from his son for his past crimes; the abandoned teenager who becomes the protector of his vulnerable cousin, while both are left in a cook and party house; and the tweaked-out, paranoid uncle who will do anything to make a buck for a bump.

Sonny (Xander Berkeley), the father trying to make good, is caught in a web of choice-less choices while he tries to improve life for the children. Abe (Ryan Donowho) captivates the viewer with his gritty actions and parental instincts. Uncle Bump (Anson Mount) is the graphic car wreck viewers don't want to watch, but they can't take their eyes away from the carnage he leaves on the street.

The fear and unscrupulous actions in the movie make the viewer feel as if she should check on the child who lives in the decaying house up the street that has more night traffic than the local truck stop. Viewers won't want to admit that Cook County is reality happening in a neighborhood near them, but it is.

Berkeley, Mount, and Donowho offer spot-on performances. They make the emotion meter bounce between hate and compassion, thus the hollow, angry feeling in the end.",1498694400,,1412,5.351351351351352

This is not my usual type of movie to watch.  If you want to see what meth can do to people, it's compelling.  However, no matter how good Anson Mount's performance is in this, his clear eyes were an indication he was acting.  Folks on meth for a long time don't have clear eyes.  What a monster he is in this film.  Demonstrates to what depths the human soul can descend.",1482883200,,511,4.361702127659575
