6254044,5,B00I8WB3ZS,This is such a nicely done DVD! Such a nice tool made for caregivers to remind us to stop and breathe and take care of ourselves also. The routine is not too long so you really can do it while your loved one is napping. Julie has such a calming presence that you feel like she is in the room with you and knows exactly what you are going thru! Having said that you do not need to be caregiving for someone to get a lot put if this wonderful DVD. It was also not too hard for me to do the routine which is important to me. Can't go wrong with this Mindful Movement DVD!,1418256000,,568,3.9051724137931036
6254045,5,B00I8WB3ZS,"Having gone through a time where keeping myself energetic enough to care for someone, I was curious how this program would work. I was very pleased with it's ability to acknowledge the emotional, spiritual and physical buckets that need filling at a time of quick depletion. The creator, Julie Bowes, clearly leads by example as she comes across with serenity, confidence and strength.  Not to mention she is extremely physically fit!  It appears self-produced which adds to the authenticity of her offering.  I highly recommend this program to people who could use help in taking care of themselves in all dimensions, and also during times of great care giving stress (or stress in general)!",1418083200,,692,5.052631578947368
8639930,1,B00I8WB3ZS,"No voice over at all -- this is a big fat why bother.  If I was going to need to watch the whole thing, I could just make up my own routine. I wanted something I could do after meditation that reminds me to move with mindful intention and this DVD does not fit the bill.

Probably just me... would not recommend.",1482883200,,312,4.016129032258065
8639931,5,B00I8WB3ZS,"I don't usually take the time to write a review but in this case I felt it imperative as both of the JewelTree DVD's reinforced for me just how easy it can be to attain a heightened sense of peace and well-being in spite of myself,  in what I often term as the ""hampster wheel"" I unfortunately find myself on!  The movements are very well ""scripted"" for any level of yogi and help to connect holistically to the actual-time that I find it important to BE within.  This drew me out of the catch-22 of mindless chatter harassing me about the Past or Future of my day and into the Peace and Wellbeing of the present moment, instead.  You have to love that no matter what situation you find yourself in.  Thanks, JewelTree!",1420675200,,719,4.37593984962406
8639932,5,B00I8WB3ZS,"When I tried this program, I had never taken a yoga class and wasn't currently serving as anyone's caregiver. So I wasn't sure how it would work for me. But I can say that it was AMAZING.

Julie leads you through a series of yoga moves--they are challenging, but not impossible for a beginner.  I was pretty fit when I tried these DVDs, working out a few times a week with a trainer, but found that I still had to pay attention to what was being said and Julie's movements on screen to keep up.  And that was the beautiful part for me--I HAD to pay attention, so I couldn't be in my head about what had happened at work or what so-and-so said or my 10-year life plan.  Julie offers not only a workout, but a challenge to stay in the moment, and that was my favorite part.

She starts the DVD with a meditation that lasts a few minutes.  I really liked the meditation, but I admit that I skipped it when I was in a hurry. I liked that I could choose which parts to do and how much time to devote to it. The whole program lasts only 30 minutes, so it's an easy way to start a yoga program or just a way to separate from your thoughts for a bit and FEEL better.  I bet this would be really great for people who want to meditate more as well!

All in all, this is a GREAT DVD, and I would recommend it for anyone starting out in yoga or mindfulness, or who needed to build their muscles for caregiving purposes.  You don't need to be physically fit or a yoga expert.  (But if you are, I'd suggest moving on to Mindful Movement 2. It's the same great program but with more challenging moves, and I bought mine online.  It's available on Amazon as well.)",1420156800,,1648,4.11875
8639933,5,B00I8WB3ZS,"This is a terrific DVD. I am not a caregiver, but I was looking for  a simple routine to do by myself at home and this is perfect. Julie is calm and gentle and I love that the yoga poses don't have fancy yoga names. They have names like 'Persistence'...I loved that. The fact that the setting is outdoor just added to the whole experience for me. Well done.",1419638400,,357,4.173913043478261
8639934,5,B00I8WB3ZS,"It was a true friend who first introduced me to Mindful Movement. I had grown dissatisified with yoga and was almost too overweight to do anything aerobic. The program worked for me by making it easy and beautiful to watch while participating in the various exercises. I especially love the way Julie (the instructor) got me to think about my body in a new way, which allowed me to take my mind off its deficiencies and focus on my inner beauty. If you need the benefit of a quick home workout, but want the caring, of a certified life coach, Mindful Movement is for you.",1419552000,,571,4.447619047619048
8639935,4,B00I8WB3ZS,"This video has achieved something new to me. Somehow, Jewel Tree  has managed to create a form of exercise that gives you a sense of purpose with each movement. It is not the typical mindless movement-that is a drudgery. Instead, you may actually look forward to the workout because there is meaning and nurturing with each movement.  You feel like she is there with you every step of the way.
I rate this video a 5 plus for content, and a 4 due to the production/sound quality. Please don't let that deter you from buying this amazing, unique video. This is soooo worthy for anyone who wishes to be cared for, to be fit, to feel a  sense of peace.",1419292800,,648,4.383333333333334
8639936,5,B00I8WB3ZS,"It is obvious that the creator of the Mindful Movement DVD, Julie Bowes, is someone who can relate to the stress of being a caregiver and realizes the importance of taking timeout for ones own nourishment.  Her genuine concern for other caregivers is apparent in her gentle encouragement and peaceful state of mind throughout the DVD.  She offers a calm moment away from your cares and the opportunity to take time for yourself to breathe and move freely.  As she implies, the practice should be undertaken with mindfulness and an awareness of ones individual body.  What an inspiration!",1418515200,,587,4.959183673469388
8639937,5,B00I8WB3ZS,Loved these videos!!  As a caregiver you do not take time for yourself.  This video gives you the motivation to take time for yourself and deeply relax.  This was a huge stress reducer.  I highly recommend this video for anyone!!,1418428800,,229,4.65
8639938,4,B00I8WB3ZS,"This  DVD is for anyone who wants to benefit from yoga and learn from an excellent teacher who presents in a very genuine, caring way. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is if you are looking for a fancily produced DVD, this isn't that kind of a DVD. If you're looking for an excellent instructional video from someone who embodies what yoga can do to keep you fit and vital, this DVD is for you.",1418256000,,407,3.9634146341463414
8639939,5,B00I8WB3ZS,We are very glad to have both Mindful Movements to guide me.  She is an excellent instructor  and I am delighted to have ordered both.,1418256000,,134,4.32
