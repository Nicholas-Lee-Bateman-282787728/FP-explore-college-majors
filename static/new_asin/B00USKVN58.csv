BUT
the 2nd part of the DVD features several shows even up to 2014
This is the best part of the DVD picture and sound is great
If You love Tarja, it's a must have
Note it's a zone ""0"",,but played fine on my 3 year old Blue Ray",1442016000,,290,3.546875
8708179,5,B00USKVN58,"Beautiful!
Even though it says it is recorded by fans, some songs are professionally recorded, they have an excellent video quality. And just the extras worth the disc. Tarja is fabulous. I highly recommend it.",1435276800,,210,5.0285714285714285
8708180,5,B00USKVN58,A must have for any Tarja fan! I am a fan and love it. Glad to finally get it and waiting for the cd to arrive!,1434326400,,111,3.3076923076923075
8708181,5,B00USKVN58,"Luna Park Ride was the third dvd on the media box set of Act 1 as a limited edition.
Since I have upgrade Act 1 to a blu-ray, I longed to have Luna Park on blu-ray as well. Now with over seventy odd minutes of extra bonus material, its definitely worth all the hassle. Although LPR was fans video from various sources like mobile phones, camcorders, etc.; it is well edited from various angles. There is still a fair amount of professionally filmed footage because fans have no access from certain angles. The live music was recorded professionally thus give you the high quality 5.1 sound. You will be surprised some of the performances were one of the best from Tarja. Probably the best Stargazer I have seen. LPR is exciting.
The bonus materials are a class of its own and an added compliment to all those who already have the original LPR dvd from Act 1. Bonus footage from Tele-Club Russia, Wacken Germany and Summer Breeze Germany are good. The brilliant performance of Damned & Divine and Neverlight is just class act.  Anteroom of Death with Van Cantor is outstanding. Worth the time. I bought my copy from Napalm records because I luv my german friends. Every fan should have a copy.",1434326400,2,1192,4.596244131455399
8708182,2,B00USKVN58,"Very upset about paying $38 for this. The video is bootleg quality at times, and yes, I have the BluRay version. When I received this and popped it in, the menu says this is fan filmed video. What? Are you serious? Was not in the description when I pre - ordered it. I would not have gotten this if I knew this before hand. The sound quality is good but I can not recommend this to anyone for this price! I already opened ,so return not possible.",1433808000,6,446,4.137931034482759
8708183,4,B00USKVN58,"Though Luna Park Ride comes out near 3 years after Act 1, the main concert is actually from the same What Lies Beneath tour a year earlier , with bonus footage ranging  from even earlier right up  to 2014.

Leaving aside you might be buying much of the same tour set twice, and though  this DVD is not on a par with Act 1 , and doesnt try to be, it is still a good buy at the price . Is it a nice to have for fans?  Very. Is it a must have if you already have  Act1 ...well probably not .

Timing wise,  DVD  splits into 2  halves:

Luna Park  (75 Minutes)
(Audio Options: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround/DTS 5.1 Surround/  PCM Stereo)

As  Amazon UK (but not USA)  product info explains, this is a very rare mix  of pro-recorded sound and fan filmed  ie often low definition video footage , although in fact some of the footage looks more pro than fan not only in quality but angle it was shot from .... overall this approach works no better or worse than the all-pro norm it its  just different  the editing presumably pro not fan  is cut well to give a good sense of being there ... not sure though about some of the fan footage of fans in front of them holding up hundreds of  cameras filming more fans in front of them etc .

Tarja and band perform fully  on a par with Act I -no Alex Scholpp nor Kevin Chown, so Doug Wimbish is onstage full-time this time, switching very ably between lead and bass during  the set as needed.

There are four numbers in the set NOT in  Act 1:
The Crying Moon/Stargazers/Signos/Wishmaster

Bonus Material (75 Minutes)
(Audio In PCM Stereo only)

This is 100% concert footage extracts,14 numbers from 5 sets 2010-2014, clubs to festivals,  no  Off Stage/Making Of etc type content.
It includes a further 3 numbers you won't find anywhere on Act 1: Neverlight/500 Letters/Victim of Ritual.  Tarja also guests live with Van Canto at  Wacken on Anteroom of Death

First four numbers featured are from Masters Of Rock 2010 Festival with full  orchestra live on stage : In For A Kill/I Walk Alone/Archive of Lost Dreams/Crimson Deep. Obviously rather less than Tarjas whole set on the night, leaves you wondering  why  more of it was not included  though maybe thats down to the audio quality here  being well just about ok but not great .",1433721600,4,2266,4.36867469879518
