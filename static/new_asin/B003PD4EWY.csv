8401956,5,B003PD4EWY,"Lovely film, directed by two friends of mine, its success prompted the HK government to preserve the Mid-levels neighborhood where it had been shot and had been slated for demolition, was a perfect present for my wonderful oncology nurse from Hong Kong, Amy.

8401957,5,B003PD4EWY,"The film is narrated by the 8 year old younger brother of a 16 year old star athlete and student who succumbs to leukemia during the course of the movie (the 16 year old, that is)..

I was interested in this film because of Sandra Ng and Simon Yam, both of whom are excellent.  It's a bit of a surprising role (to me, anyway) for Sandra Ng;  I'm most familiar with her in innumerable comedies.

One feature of the movie is every day community life in Hong Kong in the '60s.  This is evident in many HK films, but I was particularly struck by it in this one.  It didn't matter which kid ate with which family on the street; it seems like the kids were raised by the entire neighborhood.  I'm from California and never experienced anything like that (at least in the communities I lived in).

Bring Kleenex, you'll need it.",1378425600,,821,4.3202614379084965
8401958,5,B003PD4EWY,"The story lives up to its billing.  Simon Yam gives one of his best performances ever IMO.  The characters are beautifully developed and the casting was perfect.  The story is humorous, entertaining, and even a bit historical as it shows the evolution of Hong Kong and its society.  And while it provides many laughs, there is a good bit of sadness, but it would be spoiling to say why.  Buzz Chung, who plays ""Big Ears"" is the most charming, naughty little boy to hit the screen in a long while, with the most angelic face and most devilish personality.  This movie will be a great addition to the library, and one that you will not tire of watching again.",1334880000,,657,4.4789915966386555
