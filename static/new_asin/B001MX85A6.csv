3702600,5,B001MX85A6,This is a must have for any Duran Duran fan. This DVD shows the journey through their music and how us fans have followed them. Brings back a lot of good memories.,1266192000,5,163,4.125
3702601,4,B001MX85A6,"This is a must have for those of us who were apart of the resurgence of Durandemonium in 2005.  At the very least, it will make every Duranie feel a bit better about their obsessive fascination.",1262131200,15,194,4.388888888888889
3702602,5,B001MX85A6,"This entertaining film brings to mind Trekkies, the Star Trek fan documentary, as it features a number of uber-fans whose devotion to Duran Duran is unsurpassed. The film is truly personalty-driven as the filmmaker captures the quirkiness of these characters who aren't afraid to share their obsession. Footage from the band's live performances during its reunion tour (in 2003 for its 25th anniversary) and exclusive interviews with all five of the band members offer a real treat for both new and long-time fans.
There are also a number of amusing interviews with celebrity fans, including members of No Doubt, Korn, Barenakes Ladies, Kelly Ripa, Moby, etc., who express their memories of being Duran fans, many of which are amusing...and relatable.
If you're a fan--or if a mate, friend, or family member was a fan--you'll definitely get a kick out of this trip down memory lane. Keep an eye out for the amazing vintage memorabilia collections as well as photos of Duran fans in their awkward teen years, which are especially priceless.",1260748800,9,1039,5.081871345029239
3702603,5,B001MX85A6,"This was a video documentary that I was curious about so I purchased not knowing what to expect. It is a pleasant documentary following fans of Duran Duran. There are a few fans spotlighted. I felt that it was a great ""video love letter"" if you will to the fans of Duran Duran. The production team really honored the fans of Duran Duran and the band. The band does not appear in the video. Rare collectors items are spotlighted with the fans that collect them. I am a huge fan of the band and have been since 1982 since I saw the Planet Earth video. I got to wonder how I did not make it in the video (just joking).
The documentary is for the serious fan of Duran Duran. It is a must to any Durannies collection. It is fun to see other people that have the same obsession for the band I love so much.",1348272000,,800,4.101910828025478
3702604,3,B001MX85A6,"I bought this with high expectations from the reviews I read.  While it was nostalgic and you did get to see some of the group itself in it, I found myself shutting it off before it was finished.  I did like the people featured in it, they were funny and I had a nice time walking down memory lane with them.  I do have to say though, that I would have found it more entertaining if I were one of the people featured in it.  It's fun, but not worth the price.  Spend your money on ""Sing Blue Silver"" instead.  That features the band back in the day and you can enjoy some ""behind the scenes"" fun there.",1344988800,5,602,4.059322033898305
3702605,5,B001MX85A6,"Loved this DVD about Duran Duran and the Duranie fans I can relate to so much.  The interviews with the celebrities validates it all.  The band interviews and clips are awesome.  Love the comments the band made on their appreciation, experience and what they have learned from their fans.  It also shows how so many generations are becoming die hard fans!  My heart started pounding the minute I started watching this, love it!",1327708800,,427,4.794520547945205
3702606,4,B001MX85A6,"There is no doubt that Duranies are devoted. We ARE. I myself have been one since the landmark day I saw the video for 'Rio' for the first time. I was instantly hooked, and instantly interested in everything this band had to say. The music got me first, and then...whoa...Simon LeBon came on screen and that was it for me.
29 years later, Duran Duran is still a part of every day. I listen to them everyday, and my kids know all their songs. No,I don't have a half eaten piece of hot-dog in my freezer, in fact, I have never even met them, but hope springs eternal.
It wasn't always easy being a Duranie back in the day, and that is something that I would have liked to have seen mentioned in this documentary. The only other thing that bothered me was when some of the people talking about Duran Duran mention how heartbroken they were when Duran Duran broke up.
That is incorrect. They have never broken up.
Members have come and gone, and even come back, but every few years there was a new Duran Duran album and I have every single one of them.
There is also a sense of protectiveness and possessiveness that Duranies feel about this band that also was not expressed in this documentary. And now that John Taylor and Simon LeBon have embraced social media, that is something else that could be added.
All in all, I enjoyed 'meeting' all the fans in this documentary, and I could see a little piece of myself in all of them.",1327622400,4,1427,4.368421052631579
3702607,5,B001MX85A6,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon and just finished watching it. A.May. Zing. It takes me back to being 13..in 1984 I was s HUGE Duran Duran fan(though pretty much the only fan in my school, which wasn't much fun. But I digress.)

Seeing the pictures of fans from back in the day, with the dyed hair, fedoras and the denim jackets full of buttons was a lot of fun. Duran Duran are a band that inspires loyalty from a lot of their fans, and for  many years, as well(you figure the vast majority of fans were 12-14 years old which would make them in their late 30's-early 40's now(I just turned 40 in February!). That's a long lasting love of the band-a band which hasn't always been consistent with the quality of their music(let's be completely fair!) but their fans love the music even so .To each his/her own.

One aspect of the movie that I liked was that they didn't just have female fans in the movie. There were a lot of male fans(being a male Duranie back in the day couldn't have been easy- Jonathan Davis of  Korn says that he got picked on mercilessly for being a fan and for dressing like them.)

Also very cool were the interviews with the band themselves. If anyone thinks that Duran Duran are full of themselves(personally, I think they have bad days every so often-perfectly normal),they might not think so so much after watching the interviews here.",1321142400,16,1362,4.475806451612903
3702608,5,B001MX85A6,"This video was fascinating and a great addition to any Duranie's collection!  It's a great addendum to ""Sing Blue Silver"" but from more of a fan perspective.  Great interviews with the guys, too!",1311379200,3,195,4.878787878787879
3702609,5,B001MX85A6,"This documentary was a project of the heart and started when the band reunited for the pre-Astronaut tour in 2003.  It proves just how dedicated Duran Duran fans truly are. Unlike the fans of most bands, Duranies are a unique group who have grown up together with the band without ever knowing each other.  This brings the fans to the band and the band acknowledge the role that their fans have played in the last 30+ years of an amazing career.  Despite the changes in line-up or sound, Duranies have stuck by the band and each and every member...despite their presence or absence.  If you haven't seen this PLEASE take the time to order it and share some time with the Duranie family which is more dedicated than any other fans of any other artist....we are Duranies and this movie shows just who we are.",1307836800,3,806,4.537931034482758
3702610,5,B001MX85A6,"I loved it - I'm a bit of a comic geek so I'm familiar with documentaries about fans (Like 'Trekkers') - which whilst celebrating the fan culture also mocks it -- I didn't feel that at all with TSYSK, I felt it respected them and let them do the talking -

Of course the most obsessive fans will be the focus of the various stories and threads but I also felt we got to see the ordinary fans too -

I loved the fact the band were a part of this movie too - it was great to get such access to them.

I loved the Durandy section showing his commitment and dedication to his collection of memorabilia!

Vader Vader's story was moving, he kind of seemed quite obsessive - but i don't think he was too bad - his comments from his parents were good to see as it gave the mindset he was in another opinion and was touching to see and hear. I'm glad it was included.

My only niggle was that it was very American - although we did get the Duraneteers' input to the movie -- DD have a big follwing in the UK and it seemed that it was all about the US fans

I had a think about this ---
--- and in conclusion it was the only way the documentary would have worked - the UK Durannies on the whole are not as 'out there' as the US fans, to sound a clich we are just more reserved - even the Italian fans are more wilder than us UK folks - so whilst you would have had fans with posters, pins, records etc i don't think we take it to that level in he UK, some have and some did in the 80s but there English psyche and approach is different. I think the kind of person that came nearest to how most UK fans express themselves in the film would be Jonathan Davis (Korn) - they have the passion and love but are more low key - even the UK fans featured  - the 'Duranateers' were quite shy and polite - and that's just the way we are

so in retrospect the film would only really work in the US where Duran are very still a big band - in the UK the masses have in general not taken to the band or see them the same way - because we saw their rise early on - by the time they made it big in the US in around late 1982 - the band were already huge here so i think the US were having to catch up with the UK Durannies on that front

The English media also dismissed them from the start so the image they had here was like the 'boy bands' you get in the US - people did not actually see past the screaming fans and actually see them as the musicians they are - i think the UK only woke up to that fact years later when Ordinary World came out.

But i digress - I absolutely loved the film - a must for any fans of Duran Duran  and should be part of a Durannies collection.

3702611,5,B001MX85A6,"If you were or are a Duran Duran fan, this video is for you!  It will bring back all of your memories from the 80's when Duran were at the top of their game.  It has many of today's current artists explaining and claiming thier love for the band.  It's just a fun movie, check it out.",1272758400,2,284,3.9473684210526314
3702612,3,B001MX85A6,"I loved watching this film, but I'd love to see something similar done with European fans!",1267920000,,90,4.6875
8322328,5,B001MX85A6,"Knowing there is such a thing as a Duranie tribe, it makes it so much easier (and somewhat more acceptable) to be the way we are as fans of Duran Duran. This is an excellent view of some of , um, notorious fans and their different ways to celebrate the band, all with the same common goal: see them live and have something to remember them by. In the merchandising world there are nevr enough items to come on by, so eager Duranies like these are, .... on the hunt and after whatever they can be able to cherish and keepsake related to the legendary band.

Get ready to go along with these Duranies to the Astronaut (Reunion) tour concerts and the thrill of being a loyal fan. Enjoy how each one in their own way dedicate their lives in the pursuit of that one item they MUST have, ....right after the other ones before that one.

Will they finally meet the band members?
Is there Something You Should Know? Then buy this movie!",1474329600,,928,4.327586206896552
8322329,5,B001MX85A6,Great movie - amazing band. Just wish my scene wasn't cut out boohoo,1459987200,,68,4.3076923076923075
8322330,1,B001MX85A6,Some guy used his bar mitzvah money to make a video about his friends and their parents. It is painfully lame. An hour of my life I can never get back again. Don't waste your money.,1404432000,,181,4.055555555555555
8322331,3,B001MX85A6,"Fun documentary, but I think it focuses on fan pathology rather than interactions between fans and the band... but the Barenaked Ladies interview is kind of worth it.  Worth watching!  Wished I'd rented rather than BOUGHT it, though...",1399939200,,235,5.157894736842105
8322332,5,B001MX85A6,My wife and I loved this feature!  Very true and the band endorses it!  Highlight recommended for all Duran Duran fans!,1391558400,,119,4.619047619047619
8322333,4,B001MX85A6,"Good Documentary, being a Duran Fan since I was 12years
this dvd reminded me of how much I would do to get anything
that was Duran Duran ...

I guess I'm still doing it :-)",1381190400,3,172,3.914285714285714
8322334,5,B001MX85A6,"Being a fan is hard work, and a majority of the world does not understand what it really means.  For those who passively listen to a song and thing ""oh gee whiz, I might go to the concert coming this weekend if I can get someone to go with me"" are not really fans.  Real fans will go the distance.  They will laugh off (like those profiled in this documentary) those who say ""that's crazy"" or call you a groupie and seek out others in the world who share the same mentality, those who also will travel across a country or across an ocean to not just see their favorite band in question and form a friendship.  Because when you meet someone who shares your same love or enthusiasm, it's a wonderful feeling.  If you're afraid or embarrassed, get over it and join in and you will have a good time.  Some people, after all, chase football or baseball or go places to play championship golf courses, we don't seem to argue with them, and this is what those profiled here (and others) do.

Duran Duran has been with us for thirty years, suffering and enjoying the high and low points in their careers like others, and there are just as many fans who are just now discovering them as there are those who have been there since the beginning.  They endure when so many fell away, and as result, they have produced those like these fans profiled.  Some have some hilarious things like the partially eaten hot dog or the discarded cigarette butt, but all fans in their infancy think that this is cool to do.  Eventually we wake up and realize that was silly, and we start collecting all the material things (ex. the archivist Durandy) and aiming for another level, which is to go the distance and meet one of them.  Because that's what we really want (notice, I did not say ""sleep with"" because that's what groupies do, not fans), and once you do that's the ultimate achievement, to be in the club of elite fans.

Think these people are crazy?  Not I, but then again I understand completely.  I see this doumentary as both a love letter to fans (of not just Duran Duran but others as well), and a lesson to the world to see that there are others out there who have embraced their quirkiness in a healthy way.  Because we all go a little mad over something from time to time, don't we?",1379548800,2,2274,4.368171021377672
8322335,3,B001MX85A6,I love the band and remember when this documentary was being made.  I was at some of the concerts that were focused on and know who some of the people are.  I felt it spent too much time focusing on a few people rather than fans as a whole.  It could have been edited down to 30 minutes very easily and had a stronger effect.  Not trying to be mean or disrespectful of anyone...I may have expected too much.,1378944000,,407,4.113924050632911
8322336,4,B001MX85A6,it was a great video of the duran duran fans.  It felt nice to relive the memories and have a common bond with some of the fans.  After so many years they too are loyal fans!,1353369600,,174,3.8055555555555554
8322337,2,B001MX85A6,"The problem with this documentary is that it isn't a good representation of the fans of the band. There are many of us that are loyal fans but we aren't all crazy and obsessed. I could relate to the celeb interviews where they talked about how much the band meant to the them, the music, the posters covering our walls as kids, but this documentary spends way too much time on a handful of obsessed people. The Vader Vader guy wasn't dedicated...he's sad. His parents talking about how he will survive once they are dead is just pathetic. Sorry but true.  This band gets a bad rep. They are one of the best bands in the world. I wish that there was a documentary about how many fans are still fans (without spending their days obsessing and emptying their bank accounts) and what the band has meant to more of the current artists. I liked the guy from Korn and the Carson Daly interview was awesome. Too bad there wasn't more from Tony and Adrien. I know Gwen and Gavin were at the Roxy with them the night the band played in LA. Would have been awesome to hear from them. I know that Courtney Love talked about the band and how much she and Kurt listened to them.
The best part of this video is the band interviews. You can tell how much they care about their fans. Nick in particular comes across as a very caring guy.
Just seems like a missed opportunity. Maybe some day someone with more clout can get a real documentary off the ground.",1353024000,,1440,4.333333333333333
