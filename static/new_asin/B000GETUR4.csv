8131142,1,B000GETUR4,"I'm not very happy with this purchase for a few reasons.

1. The video quality painfully blurry. Its so blurry, I'm surprised the company that produced this title thought it was acceptable. Often times it is very difficult/impossible to see important lines that the artist lays out in the early stages.

2. The artist does a very poor job of teaching/explaining what he is doing. Its mostly just rambling. Through the course of the drawing, the bulk of the dialog sounds like ""then we put some black here, a few dots here"". He doesn't really explain shapes and perspective very well. Because he is an advanced artist he estimates a lot, which makes it all kind of look like ""magic"".

3. This one is very subjective. I just don't like the artists style. Its very messy and loose. If you buy and follow this DVD then you can forget about penmanship. All of the examples pretty much look like the same design/style as well.

If you're in to clean lines, or want really good explanations of technique, I recommend Scott Robertsons vehicle drawing DVDs.",1368748800,,1048,4.679347826086956
