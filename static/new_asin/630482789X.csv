7878779,4,630482789X,"The movie begins with a few words from Cecil B. Demille.  Here he describes what the movie will cover and also touches on the background for this movie.  He mentions the books of Genesis and Exodus, but also mentions the writings of Philo and Josephus.  This lets you know that there are additional parts here that are not taken straight from the Bible.
The movie begins with quite a bit of rivalry between Charleton Heston and Yul Brenner.  Both are good actors, and the rivalry adds emphasis to their confrontation when Moses asks Pharaoh to let his people go.
Although some of the special effects aren't as captivating by today's standards, this is still a beautiful film.  I would recommend seeing this movie.",1022025600,2,713,4.764227642276423
7878780,5,630482789X,"That's the last line Yul Brynner utters in ""The Ten Commandments"", and for me, that is really the end of the film; the whole rest of the Wandering in the Desert isn't all that interesting, compared with what had gone before. You might wonder why then a five-star rating, but that's how much fun I find all the ""Egyptian"" characters in the movie. They certainly have all the best parts: Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharoah Seti; Yul Brynner as Ramses, heir presumptive; Anne Baxter as Neferteri, the throne princess destined to marry solely a Pharoah; Dame Judith Anderson as the Memnet, Egyptian slave in on a big secret; Vincent Price as Baka, the Master Builder of Seti's treasure city. Throw in Edward G. Robinson as Dathan; even though he's a Hebrew overseer, he spends most of his time among the Egyptians. Star Charlton Heston as Moses is actually kind of boring--he's one-dimensional and has no character development. But every time one of those ""Egyptians"" comes along on camera--pow!--you've got some wonderful scenery chewing. Check out the great special effects, too.",997142400,,1074,4.972222222222222
7878781,5,630482789X,"Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter and John Derek star in this classic tale of Moses' life. This picture is SPECTACULARLY acted, SUPERBLY directed by Oscar winner Cecil B. DeMille and LOADED with TERRIFIC costumes. One question, why isn't this classic on one cassete? The animated version of the movie is good for kids. Charlton Heston delivers another MAGNIFICENT performance. It's movies like THESE we should appreciate NOT crap like The Matrix. Grab some freshly microwaved popcorn and watch this 4 hour classic. You'll LOVE it. Rated G.",983145600,5,547,5.2272727272727275
7878782,5,630482789X,"There have been other Bible-themed movies more critically praised than DeMille's 1956 epic. ""Ben-Hur,"" ""King of Kings,"" ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" are three received high marks from  reviewers throughout the land. However, none of the films have the immense  popularity of ""The Ten Commandments. An annual television airing  garners high ratings when the film is shown around Eastertime.
The chief  reason is simple: THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT SEX!
Forget the ""burning  bush."" ""Disregard the plagues."" ""Ignore the  ""parting of the Red Sea.""  Demille and his screenwriters  understood that the Bible does not shy away from this most common of all  basic instincts.  How can one ignore that Genesis, the first book, has a  lot of ""begetting"" going on?
In a nutshell, everyone has  ""THE HOTS"" for someone else in this movie. Nefertiri, wife of  Pharoah has designs on Moses, Baka and Dathan have got it bad for Lillith,  each of Sephora's six sisters wants ""a roll in the meadow"" with  Moses, and in a very early comment, the wife of a visiting Ethiopian king  expresses her infatuation with the studly appearance of ""the Prince of  Egypt,"" much to Nefetiri's obvious disapproval.
Even, near the  film's end, upon construction of the ""Golden Calf,"" a  full-fledged orgy takes place.
Who knew the Bible could be such  ""fun?""",963100800,3,1319,4.990783410138249
