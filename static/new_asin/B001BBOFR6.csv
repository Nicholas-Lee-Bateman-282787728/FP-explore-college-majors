8282631,5,B001BBOFR6,"It took people to make the Golden Age of Hollywood and Merv Griffin's interviews preserves the thoughts and stories of many of the greatest personalities of the Mid Twentieth Century's Entertainment Industry.  These were the stars that made the Golden Age golden.
Over the course of some 23 years Merv Griffin had the opportunity to interview over 25 thousand guests on his daily television show.
The Merv Griffin Show Set preserves 40 of the most interesting people of the last century in an informal talk show type of format.
I was attracted to Disc One, ""The Greatest Hollywood Legends"" because of the collection it offered of entertainers of my own time.  Many in the collection were recorded in the early 1970's when color television was a fairly new medium.  Today, few of those interviewed by Merv Griffin are still living and in some cases, such as that of Orson Welles, the interview given on the Merv Griffin Show was the last one ever given in the actor and director's lifetime.

Some of the Hollywood Stars featured in the collection include: ORSON WELLES, INGRID BERGMAN, RICHARD BURTON, SOPHIA LOREN, SAMMY DAVIS JR., DAVID NIVEN, (a young) TOM CRUISE, JANE FONDA, ROGER VADIM, DENZEL WASHINGTON, SIR LAWRENCE OLIVIER, MICHAEL CAINE, JOAN COLLINS, TOM HANKS, LEE MARVIN, JANET LEIGH, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, GRACE KELLY, CHRISTOPHER REEVE, JOHN WAYNE, CLARENCE NASH, AND ROY ROGERS.

This is a stunning interview collection of  the who's who of Hollywood at the time.  Merv Griffin had a natural talent for putting his guests at ease while eliciting some of their most personal thoughts and stories.  Some of his celebrity guests either seldom gave public interviews because of their echelon in the industry, or else were quite guarded and brief when they did.  Most, but not all, of the collection was video taped in the studio.  The Ingrid Bergman interview was taped on location, as I recall, at the Cannes Festival.
The Orson Welles interview is one of the most exceptional ones he ever gave and was recorded only a day or so before he died.
Many of the other celebrities were also at the end of their careers giving considerable poignancy to their career observations, such as the: David Niven, Lawrence Olivier, Grace Kelly, Richard Burton, and Ingrid Bergman interviews, especially.  The Sophia Loren interview contains a hilarious story of a comment perpetrated on her by Charles Nelson Riley, during a previous show.  Hear it for yourself!

While I could extoll this collection endlessly, it is bittersweet to witness some of the last television appearances recorded by several personalities iconic to the entertainment industry.  A sad bit of trivia to add is that it is especially remarkable that these interviews survived in the archives of a television network, because many of the large quadraplex video tapes were routinely ERASED and then reused for subsequent broadcasts because the tapes, themselves, were so expensive and because a show like Mer Griffin was done on a frequent daily basis.  Very, very sadly many of the shows for several seasons in the early 1970's were erased.  This collection is one of the SURVIVORS; the rare recordings of another era.  One missing celebrity in this collection is Rita Hayworth.  She was interviewed by Merv Griffin, and danced on his show, in one of the ERASED episodes.  Oh to have the video tape of that
unique encounter back again!  But we're very fortunate that so many of Merv Griffin's interviews with the famous did survive and this
DVD provides an insight into the lives of some of America's greatest entertainers.",1366675200,5,3593,5.00672268907563
