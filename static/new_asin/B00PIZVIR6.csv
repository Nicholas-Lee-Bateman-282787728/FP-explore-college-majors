8688188,5,B00PIZVIR6,"Director Robert Stevenson calls on the dark imagery of black and white classics like Nosferatu and Casablanca for its fast paced and beautiful rendition of Charlotte Bronte's classic Jane Eyre. This version is the most comprehensive and enjoyable movie adaptation of Jane Eyre. It captures the entirety of the novel in a brisk 97 minutes. Gorgeous lighting, dark atmosphere, perfect framing, and Bernard Herrmann's gothic classic score all meld beautifully to make Stevenson's Jane Eyre lovely.

The writing from the novel is as fresh and thoughtful as ever with the master author Aldous Huxley writing the script itself. Every line pops. You have never seen a version of Jane Eyre as engaging and timeless as this 1944 definitive take from Stevenson.

Notably, the great actor Orson Welles delivers a visceral, scary, and charming performance as Edward Rochester. He is so much fun to watch on screen. He can be frightening, but endearing as well. You have never heard a more compelling Rochester.

Joan Fontaine is so sweet and sincere as Jane Eyre. She adds a quiet sweetness and thoughtfulness to the character. She truly gave the performance of a lifetime.

Jane Eyre features an unheard star studded cast. Agnes Moorehead is so cruel as Henry Daniell delivers heinous monologue after monologue. You will love how mean they play their respective parts. Margaret O'Brien is adorable and lovable as Adele. Peggy Ann Garner is quite compelling for a child actress as young Jane Eyre. Last but certainly not least, Elizabeth Taylor is so sweet and captivating even as a child actress playing Helen. Super casting all around in this Jane Eyre.

Overall, this is the only Jane Eyre film you will ever want to watch. Orson Welles is endlessly entertaining, Joan Fontaine is sublime, the music is glorious, the direction is stalwart, and the writing is brilliant. Be enchanted by the greatest Jane Eyre adaptation!",1528416000,,1911,5.073248407643312

The casting of Joan Fontaine and Orson Wells was a stroke of genius. And on Blu-ray it is beautiful even if it is a black & white movie. Elizabeth Taylor has a small role in this film.
