8662545,5,B00KXQKACO,"Love this video.  Purchased as a gift for my adult son who now has his first horse.  Ray Hunt is the source of sources when it comes to working with wild and untrained horses. Very informative and instructive.  We can watch this one again and again, and continue to learn something more about the relationship between horse and man. Quick service, and excellent product.",1445212800,,370,4.75
8662546,2,B00KXQKACO,"The DVD had no commentary of what he was doing, consisted of loud western music which faded in and out of the DVD in certain spots. I could see that Ray Hunt was talking directly at the camera, especially at end of the DVD but  impossible to hear what he said even with the sound up to maximum. The DVD was also far to short for the price I paid. I feel I have wasted my money on this DVD, compared to other trainers such as Pat Parelli, Buck Brannam  and several others I have watched, it was very poor in content and quality.",1441929600,3,527,4.0576923076923075
8662547,5,B00KXQKACO,His approach and philosophy about horsemanship is truly the way we should start our foundation. Then all other goals we have with and for our horse built from there.,1441670400,,165,4.724137931034483
