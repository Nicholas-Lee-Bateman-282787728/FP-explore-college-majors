4911417,5,B005ZTGRMG,"I first came across this series on netflix, where I became completely and utterly hooked. However half way through the series it was removed from instant Que. I do not like many TV shows in general so I was surprised at how amazing this series is. Filled with suspense at every turn, drama where it is meant to be, and romance to top it all off. The action however is only so-so, but that is not what you would watch this for. None the less it does not change how wonderfully made it is.

I highly recommend this series to anyone, please do not let the subtitles scare you away. You would just be missing out on a great series.

As far as other reviews go, some people were upset at the ending... I would have to disagree. Nothing is ever it is all a part of what makes this series so wonderful and I could not ask for anything better... Other than a second season ;-)",1328659200,,868,4.191616766467066
4911418,3,B005ZTGRMG,"I love K-dramas, but this one is in the middle of the pack.

This wildly popular series (20 episodes, 60 minutes each) is about a man who is trained from birth to seek revenge against the government officials who ordered the assassination of his father during a secret mission.  First and foremost, the script is as dumb as a bag of bricks, with plotholes up the wazoo.  One can only laugh at the preposterousness of it all.  For example, the hard-nosed guardian of the protagonist can seemingly pose as any random employee and immediately gain access to highly secure areas near high profile officials.  None of the security protocols are even remotely effective.  (It makes the latter seasons of ""24"" seem like the posterchild for realism.)  And that's not all, because the character decision-making at times makes no sense and there are absurd contrivances peppered throughout.

Despite its incompetence, however, this series is inexplicably fun to watch.  It moves at a brisk pace, has a likeable cast, and shifts between genres to hold attention.  The action is pretty good and there are a few respectable dramatic moments during the later episodes.  There is also one really cool scene in a bathroom involving mirrors.  The lead actor (Min-ho Lee) is given the opportunity to display his acting chops thru a variety of emotions, and he's definitely someone to look out for in the future.",1327881600,3,1393,4.931330472103005
4911419,4,B005ZTGRMG,"I have watched a lot of Korean dramas and City Hunter is close to the top of my list of favorites. The entire drama had me captivated and Lee Min Ho was absolutely phenomenal in my opinion. I liked him much better in City Hunter than I did in Boys Over Flowers. My only complaint about this series is the ending, it falls flat. After investing 20+ hours into a drama and coming to love the characters I didn't feel like there was much of a close to the story, it ended rather abruptly. That said, I still love the drama and it has really stuck with me. I miss watching the characters and the story, I even tear up every time I hear the song Suddenly by Kim Bo Kyung from the soundtrack. Overall I feel City Hunter is a must watch, search it and you can watch it on many Asian drama sites before investing the money to add it your collection.",1327017600,25,841,4.134146341463414
4911420,5,B005ZTGRMG,"My husband gave me this DVD from Amazon and it is simply wonderful.  I was really looking forward to it, and it arrived in a timely manner.  It has become one of my favorite Korean drama with lots of action and fun love story.  The story line is solid (although there is too much redundancy on the revenge theme), the quality of the picture is really good and the translation was well done.  It features a very good soundtrack. The cast is very good looking.  I was a little disappointed that there was no pamphlet inside the DVD case however there is a special feature on the last disc which features 78 mins. of cast interviews and location.  Overall - awsome!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B005ZTGRMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>",1324166400,,800,5.36
4911421,5,B005ZTGRMG,"I've watched a lot of Kdramas and this is the first one I felt was worth buying. I spent bits and pieces of my weekend watching it in parts, fast forwarding to my favorite scenes, etc.
I saw a bunch of reviews that cover the drama itself, and since I agree 100% with them I won't reiterate. This is an awesome show, but I suggest watching it on Hulu before going out and buying it.
I was really disappointed in Amazon's packaging. Both DVD cases in the box arrived with a broken spine. I didn't want to have to deal with returns or claims or anything, so I fixed it with superglue, but it was definitely disappointing to pay that much for a show and not even get it shipped in a decent manner. It came in a padded envelope, while a Southpark season I ordered for my brother a week before came in a reinforced cardboard box. I hope this doesn't happen to everyone, and I hope they change their shipping method for this package.",1324080000,,926,4.267045454545454
4911422,5,B005ZTGRMG,"This kdrama has everything you looking for wrap in one. You get romance, revenge, action, family drama, intrigue, heart and so much more. Lee Min Ho shines in his role as City Hunter and the cast is just solid. This drama can keep you in your toes at all moments and asking for more. The music (OST) and direction is just amazing. Indeed one of the best action dramas of 2011, you can't go wrong by watching CH, is just a thrill ride down to the end.",1323302400,49,450,4.183908045977011
4911423,5,B005ZTGRMG,I really like this drama. If you like action&romance you should really watch. I am watching this over and over again.,1322697600,4,117,4.619047619047619
4911424,5,B005ZTGRMG,Love this movie. Good quality.,1417564800,,30,5.2
4911425,3,B005ZTGRMG,"The storyline is great.  Most of the K dramas have very old and static storyline in which there is a boy and girl and one of them is either sick or poor.  There is great wealth possessed by one but not by the other.  In the end, one dies and one lives.  The life goes on.  This one is different, though the ending is somewhat predictablble.  Yet, the storyline has orginality to it.  I'd say just for that it gets 5 stars.  Cinematography is not good, however.  they had opportunity to do on-location shooting and to capture some great images but what showed up on screen was just plain old image nothing more than you'd get from a typical K drama. What really blew was the acting.  No emotion, no sadness, no happiness, and worst of all no passion. This Lee Min Ho guy can't act.  He really needs some acting lessons.  The dude's good looking but he just cannot act.  Paul Giomatti who is the total opposite (in terms of looks) would have done a 10 times better job.  The leading actress is pretty but again, cannot act. It almost hurts watching her. And the ackwardness between the two are simply terrible.  the main prosecutor can't act. the ex-wife of the prosecutor can't even say her dialog correctly.  (she is otherwise a super hottie deserving her own show somewhere where she doesn't have to talk and need to expose more skin).  the only two people who can act in the whole darn series are 1) the president and 2) the mom.  Those two people along with the villains pretty much made the series.",1416787200,,1502,4.41970802919708
4911426,4,B005ZTGRMG,"""City Hunter"" is more of a movie broken up into segments than a television drama.  Big sets, big action, very interesting story.  Actually surprised that the government of South Korea allowed it to be made, since it starts with a retaliation commando raid into North Korea.  Very good 'movie.'",1413417600,,293,4.938775510204081
4911427,3,B005ZTGRMG,The description said it's widescreen but the DVD delivered is full screen.  Very disappointing.  Also one cannot pick a particular episode to watch after the set up options is chosen.,1411257600,4,183,5.066666666666666
4911428,3,B005ZTGRMG,"I know I am like 3 years too late.  The reason I was holding out on watching this drama is I don't like how the way they earned the money or got rich.  I would say it's a blood money.  Selling drugs and being drugs lords.  How is that making them good people?  They are killing millions by selling drugs.  Probably helping terrorists too.  There was a part in the drama where one man got shot and killed because he sold drugs in Korea. So it's ok to sell drugs anywhere, but not in Korea?  All the wealth the main character has were from selling drugs.  I wouldn't be so proud of that.  At least the writers could have thought up of something along the line of Bruce Wayne/Batman character.  Earned his wealth honestly.  Bruce Wayne is no drugs pushers.  He is more admirable character.  They could have made up a story about on how they got rich by inventing something big like Steve Job how he made his wealth. Anything but drugs (it's a lazy way of earning money).  I don't think the City Hunter is a hero by ways of how he got his wealth. I haven't reached the end of the drama so I don't know if he will change his ways.  Anyhow..that's by two cents.",1409616000,,1155,4.205479452054795

4911432,3,B005ZTGRMG,"We will watch this story over and over again (the story gets 5 stars), the DVD, however, is disappointing. The aspect ratio is wrong - the sides of the picture are cut off, and the default voices are overdubbed Chinese rather than the original voices of the actors. Also, the product packing is cheap: there is simply a wrapper around a plain plastic case, and the CD's are loose in envelopes. There was no Blu-ray.

I'm glad to have a copy since ""City Hunter"" is expiring from Netflix soon, but this was the only one in a format for U.S. machines available that I could find.",1400112000,5,576,4.433962264150943

4911434,5,B005ZTGRMG,"CITY HUNTER takes the dramatic and comedic talents of Lee Min Ho to create a myth of a Korean Robin Hood who stands up for the little guy against an entrenched government corruption that begins at the very highest level. Ostensibly a revenge film, CITY HUNTER explores the conflicting need for revenge by the oppressed against the inevitability of collateral damage to the innocent. Twenty-eight years ago a squad of twenty-one heroic South Korean commandos infiltrate a North Korean compound only to be betrayed by their own superiors who tried too late to scrub their mission. One of the twenty-one survives and vows vengeance on those five superiors, thus setting in motion the plot driving a series of twenty episodes. This survivor kidnaps the baby of one of the fallen others and raises him as a tool of that vengeance. This baby grows up to be Lee Min ho and the charm of the film resides in a complex web of overlapping emotions. At what point does the blind need for revenge morph into the very sort of evil that caused the need for this revenge in the first place? CITY HUNTER takes us into the slowly expanding morality of a man who can no longer view evil in black and white terms.  Along the way he encounters others who think as he does, including the henchman of his kidnapper-father who is similarly forced to re-evaluate loyalty to a man against reverence to humanity. As with many Korean dramas, there is plenty of romance with the Handsome Man (Ho) and a Beautiful Woman (Park Min Young), both of whom bicker, fall in love, quarrel, and predictably reconcile. There are numerous subplots that swerve in and out of broad farce and snickering sexual non-innuendos. In the world of current Korean drama, passion and lust exist only on the outer fringes of the script. Despite the very broad canvas of politics, intrigue, tear-filled romance, farce, and the martial arts, CITY HUNTER manages to engage the viewer sufficiently well to last for the full run of twenty episodes.",1396656000,,1990,4.768115942028985
4911435,3,B005ZTGRMG,"Researched Korean culture after watching this and learned a lot. Thought all the actors did very well in depicting their parts and the music was very well placed to enhance the action and story. Great music. Characters were well developed and the plot didn't drag like it does with some of the other dramas with too many episodes. Don't case for violent action and there was too much of that and the ending, as others have said, left you wondering what they intended, but didn't seem like it was in line with how they had developed the characters relationship all the way through. Think they could have shown him continuing his vigilanty role with her help instead of a vague dumping of everyone but him. What was that all about. Ship everyone off - weird. Did not at all seem the logical conclusion to their story line.",1393372800,,820,4.585034013605442

4911440,4,B005ZTGRMG,"I'm a big fan of action movies.  Quite by accident, I discovered the world of K-Dramas (and this adaption of City Hunter).  I'm now a huge fan of Lee Min Ho.  You can't really put LMH in the same category as Jackie Chan and Jet Li (he's not a martial artist) but he IS a very talented actor and he really delivers the fight scenes and action scenes.  This drama has everything; action, romance, and comedy.  There's something here for everyone.  I enjoyed this drama so much that I purchased it on DVD.  The first episode (mostly dedicated to the back story) moves a little slow, but after that, the story moves very quickly.  There are 20 episodes (20 hours) and before you realize it, you're at the end!  I've watched this drama three times in the past six months.  I disagree with many of the other reviewers that the final episode falls flat.  I was riveted by the final episode.  I think some people are disappointed with the ambiguity of where the relationship between Young-soo and Na-na goes at the end, but if you pay closer attention to the ending, it actually leaves the story open to a sequel.  This drama is Korean and is subtitled.  Although there are some typos in the English subtitling (and some errors in grammar) it's fine and you're totally able to follow what's going on.  I would highly recommend watching this on a big screen.  The first time I watched it, I watched it on my Kindle Fire.  After purchasing the DVD, I watched it on my 54 inch TV and enjoyed it so much more on a bigger screen.",1388793600,3,1516,4.415162454873646
4911441,5,B005ZTGRMG,A great show from Lee Min Ho. Keeps you wanting to watch the next episode. The lead actress is awesome. You will fall in love with her from the start.

I thought this DVD was an extremely wonderful price, but there were several problems. The DVD is in Vietnamese and there are no English subtitles to go along with it.  I wanted the Korean version and no where in this product description does it say that it in Vietnamese. It lists the language as Korean, but it is not in Korean! I wish it had English subtitles and it at least would have been a little better.

4911459,5,B005ZTGRMG,"City Hunter is an unusual and captivating story. After being abandoned by the government while on a secret mission, Lee Jin Pyo (Kim Sang Joong)abducts his best friend's new born, Lee Yoon Sung (Lee Min Ho), and raises him to be a tool for his vengeance. Fast forward through his formative years in the Golden Triangle in his foster dad's drug empire, Yoon Sung goes to school at MIT, creates a new identity and returns to Korea at 28. Jin Pyo's vengeance is fierce and unforgiving, though, and becomes too brutal for Yoon Sung, who would rather expose the few betrayers. The story expands to include Yoon Sung's friendship with Bae Shik Joon (a kind and funny soul as played by Kim Sang Ho) and his romantic interest in Kim Na Na (Park Min Young.) Lee Yoon Sung becomes the secret City Hunter, pursued by the Seoul prosecutor's office in the persona of Kim Young Jo (Lee Joon Hyuk), the son of one of Yoon Sung's targets. What will happen? Will Yoon Sung be discovered? Will he and Kim Na Na ever get together? Will his foster father ever tell him the truth? Will he be able to live the 'normal' life of a regular guy? Action and romance abound. I think you will enjoy it.

City Hunter was only my second k-drama. I started with a recommendation of Hulu+: Faith: The Great Doctor ([...].) I was blown away. I love the fact that generally the shows are only 16-25 episodes long. In other words, long enough to develop the characters and the story without sacrificing the present entertainment for the future of a possible extension. The format is just different enough from standard American TV fare but different enough to keep you enjoying a good story, good writing and good acting. The subtitles are generally pretty good; every now and then you might see nonsense as with any translation.

(Once you realize that Lee Minho is a model as well as an actor and that Koreans seem to appreciate beautiful clothes on their beautiful people, you can understand his wardrobe. Besides, he was filthy rich in the show.)",1360627200,,2014,4.607242339832869

It was a great series with a nice balance between action, romance, and bits of humor sprinkled around-- which made it all the more sad when the director/writers dropped the ball at the end and ended things quite suddenly.

I must say, I was not disappointed. I spent a couple of weekends watching 2 and sometimes 3 episodes back to back. Most often though, I watched one each night. The action scenes are great, at least to me, and how the main character gets into places most could never do is interesting.

The one thing I was disappointed with was the special features that spent 99.99% on the main character; I was expecting to see and hear from more of the actors/actresses. However, I did like seeing where they filmed some of the scenes.

Wikipedia has detailed information on these productions and the actors.  This Korean TV series is by very far the best (though very different) version.

4911469,5,B005ZTGRMG,"I already watched City Hunter, but wanted to purchase the drama series for myself since I liked it sooo much! It's actually my first now that I think about it.  My box was dented so I was super depressed/mad about that, but it would've cost me more to return/exchange it since I would have to pay for the shipping and handling fees. Therefore, I decided to keep it anyways.  I'm a bit sad about the set not having as much pictures/photos as I expected, but that's okay.  The subtitles are good.  There is only English subtitles and this set comes with 78 minutes of behind-the-scenes and interviews special feature.  I still give it 5 stars because I personally felt that the drama have one of the best timing ever (by that i mean the storyline isn't too slow, or fast)..the ending could've been explained more but after re-watching it 4 times in a row I understand and am enlightened by the ending now.",1352160000,3,903,4.515337423312883

This BTW is a remake of a Japanese manga/anime which Jackie Chan made into a movie ages ago LOL.  Except for the abrubt ending (didn't end badly, just too glossed over) I have no criticisms of this!  It cements Lee Min Ho as MAJOR movie star - I personally would be upset to see some Hollywood remake of this WITHOUT him.
Definitely recommend this!",1350864000,,560,4.41747572815534
4911471,5,B005ZTGRMG,"City Hunter is one of my favorite Korean dramas. It is fun and engaging and you will love the characters. If Lee Min Ho was not in it I would give it 4 stars because I wanted a more explicit ending between the two main characters. He is phenomenal, though, and pushes this series up to 5 stars fo me. Watch it on the many Korean drama websides or Netflix first to get a taste for it. You won't be sorry.",1350172800,,403,3.9876543209876543

I watched this on Hulu Plus and have it available to me anytime, but this was such a great drama that I had to buy it to add to my collection.

This series is totally different from the original japanese manga ""City Hunter"" but gives the basic idea: Revenge! It started too fast but you get in the flow. I love Lee Min Ho and I think he did a very good job in portraying Yoon Sung it brings out a more mature Min Ho. I first saw Min Ho in Boys Over Flowers (which is a MUST see) and fell in love with him. I give this a 5-star rating not because of the actors/actress but of the content it has. If you like romance, betrayal, comedy and action all in one, then this is what you should see.",1347580800,,650,3.969465648854962

4911477,5,B005ZTGRMG,"I can't watch American dramas anymore!  K-Dramas have ruined them for me, especially City Hunter.  I LOVE THIS SERIES!  It's unlike most K-Dramas because it's grittier, extremely intense, and loaded with lots of ongoing action.  Yes, there is still romance and bits of comedy in it, but City Hunter truly stands out from most K-Dramas.  From the beginning you are taken on a roller coaster with so many twists and turns.  I was stressed out through the entire series, fearful of what was going to happen next for the City Hunter.  Would he get caught?  Would he die?  Why were people getting in his way?  I even found myself shouting, ""GET OUTTA THERE!""

Here is the premise of the story:  In 1983, terrorists strike the South Korean government causing FIVE South Korean politicians to band together and plot a secret mission.  The mission is to send a 21-man commando team into North Korea to eliminate the men behind the terrorists attack. However, things go wrong when THE FIVE receive word that their President will prosecute anyone who sanctions retaliation against the North.  Together, they instead conspire to have their elite team assassinated before they can leave enemy territory. (Nice, huh!) One man, Jin-pyo (played by Kim Sang-Joong), survives.  After watching his men, including his best friend, being gunned down, he swears to avenge his fallen comrades by murdering the five politicians responsible for planning the raid, ordering the men's deaths, and covering it all up. Jin-pyo then kidnaps his dead partner's newborn son, Yoon-sung (played by talented Lee Min-Ho from Boys Over Flowers), and raises him as his own, training him to be a lethal killer in order to extract his revenge on THE FIVE.  Twenty-eight years later, Jin-pyo and Yoon-sung return to South Korea to avenge the fallen soldiers.  Yoon-sung soon finds more than he bargained for and that you really can't trust anyone around you.  There is terrorism, deaths, politics, and the military wrapped in this drama series.  Yoon-sung is skilled at what he does.  I loved his martial arts moves, his ability to always be a step ahead, and how he used his charm, money, and looks to seduce those around him.  Actor Lee Min-Ho does an EXCELLENT job as the City Hunter.  You feel his pain, determination, and need to complete the task no matter the cost.  His foster father was great, too.  He is so cruel and fueled by revenge.  Soon the two clash because the City Hunter wants to destroy THE FIVE's lives by ruining their picture perfect images to the public while Jin-pyo wants to end their lives permanently.  Lee Joon-Hyuk was fantastic as prosecutor Young-ju.  He stressed me out the most because he was a force to be reckoned with; pursuing the City Hunter to the point of obsession. Even the cook/butler, Bae Shik Joong (played by Kim Sang Ho) did a good job adding comic relief here and there.  I loved his loyalty to Yoon-sung.  It was a little hard for me to swallow Kim Nana (played by Park Min-young) as a presidential bodyguard.  She looked to delicate and often got on my nerves.  She wasn't bad but sometimes I wanted her to be quiet instead of always bothering the City Hunter.

This is a FANTASTIC K-Drama.  Highly recommend it!  Many twists throughout.

This review is for the YA Entertainment Studio Version of the Korean Series City Hunter. Subtitles are excellent (easy to read, few grammar errors).  Picture quality is amazing.  Great buy!",1342310400,16,3440,4.848797250859106
4911478,5,B005ZTGRMG,"Very good drama!  I really enjoyed it and it had me totally glued to my TV.  The characters were all wonderful!  I agree that the end could be confusing.  After reading the reviews, however, I was prepared for an odd ending.  I also looked up the directors explanation and it made perfect sense.  It also helps to think of the City Hunter as a comic book character.  I compared it to movies made from Marvel comics and it helped make more sense of the end.

If I had one complaint it would be that they sort of dropped the love story about four hours from the end.  I would have liked to see the tention of the love story all the way to the end but I still liked the drama.

I would highly recommend it!!!!",1341273600,,706,4.125
4911479,5,B005ZTGRMG,"Like all good K-Dramas, CITY HUNTER has gradually become an old friend to me over the last few months since I first started watching it on Netflix.  You know it's gotten under your skin when you start feeling emotional over a few notes from the soundtrack.

If I had to relate it to popular Western stories, I would say it's THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO meets THE BOURNE IDENTITY, with fun and creative fight scenes pumped up with a little bullet time reminsicent of THE MATRIX.

Perhaps my favorite part of the drama is the chemistry between the male lead Yoon Sung (played by Lee Min Ho) and the female lead Kim Nana (played by Park Min Young).  It's hard not to root for them.

My ONLY reservation about the show worth mentioning is one already pointed out by other reviewers: the ending.  I'm not going to spoil it except to say that it's way too rushed.  It's not a BAD ending per se, because happy endings are given or at least implied for MOST of the main characters.  The more I watch it, the more I get used to the ending, and I'm not nearly as irritated by it as I was at first.  For me, the story is compelling enough to overcome this flaw in the works.

We all know that melodrama can be done badly, but if you are at all susceptible to the charms of a GOOD melodrama, CITY HUNTER should be quite a treat for you, as it was for me.

I highly recommend checking this out on Netflix or Hulu or one of the other major streaming providers and then, if you find yourself getting into it after a few episodes, rush back here and buy yourself a copy to support the talented people involved at every stage of the process and ensure we get to see more shows like this here on Western shores.

Enjoy!",1337817600,4,1699,4.24223602484472
4911480,5,B005ZTGRMG,"This was definitely worth my money. I love this show sooooo much and I wish there was another season. So pros and cons of this. Pro: The disks are perfectly fine and so are the DVD boxes
Con: The actual box that contained the 2 DVD boxes was dented
This made me really sad. I really don't want to deal with the return thing so I'm keeping it. If you don't mind a little dent then you'll be fine. I hope that next time they'll ship it better. Hopefully this doesn't happen to you guys. Anyway I definitely recommend watching City Hunter online before you buy it cause you don't want to buy something you hate right?

4911481,3,B005ZTGRMG,"Another good SBS K-Drama. This one is alot more action-oriented and grittier than your typical K-drama, but romance and comedy are still there. Lee Min Ho and especially Lee Joon-Hyuk (as the prosecutor) do a fantastic job as the 2 male leads. The only thing that I found annoying (and comical) about these 2 guys was Lee Min Ho's sometimes outrageous wardrobe selections.....someone who's supposed to be ""stealthy"" shouldn't dress like a bad 1980's ""Miami Vice"" character. The main female lead, Park Min-Young, does a decent job but she doesn't have a whole lot of interaction with Lee Min-Ho other than a few romantic scenes which is disappointing. Also, the ending was not very good.....too abrupt and too many loose ends still hanging.....almost like the writers couldn't figure out how to end it properly.",1337299200,7,810,5.052238805970149

The music to the series is great too with several radio hits.  Wonderful action/adventure/romance with a touch of comedy and drama.... a bit of everything but blended very well.
