Mixing 2 of the most popular horror genres .It's Just different &quirky enough to make it highly entertaining! Just keep in mind this is a micro-budget movie. If you are looking for a multi million$$ Hollywood  movie then this is not for you. Why the 5 star rating? Making a movie such as this with apparently no budget,and still be entertaining can not be easy ,but they do manage to accomplish entertaining their audience.",1465257600,,504,4.7272727272727275

I love watching B-horror movies and tearing them up, similar to Mystery Science Theater 3000, and this ""movie"" made it so easy it was almost no fun... almost. If you have nothing to do with your life, and are alone in your bed with nothing to do, no one to call, and nowhere to be, try to forget this movie. Unless you really are that 1% like me that find some satisfaction watching junk. Then by all means tune in.",1471651200,2,503,4.195876288659794
7671825,1,B01C4D5046,"I've seen quite a few Z-grade shark movies lately, and didn't think that they could get much worse than ""Avalanche Sharks"", but boy was I wrong. ""Shark Exorcist"" has an astonishing title, so I bought it. It amazes me that something with sharks and demonic possession can be so boring and incoherent. Apparently ""plot"" is just a four letter word for filmmaker Donald Farmer and company, as it's nearly impossible to tell what is happening and why at any point during this movie even if you're trying. The film starts with a deranged murderous nun going out by a lake and spewing ridiculous dialogue like ""The world has betrayed me, so the world will taste my vengeance!"" She then calls on Satan to send her ""an avenger"" and what she gets is a preposterous CGI shark with glowing yellow eyes.

There isn't much action with the shark: there are a few scenes of it swimming around but the compositing between the CGI and live action is essentially negligible. I frankly don't know what was going on much of the time, but there were lots of girls running around by the lake, mostly writhing around on the ground and invoking ""the spirit of the water"", there is a twentysomething couple frolicking in the water with ghastly ugly tattoos (he doesn't make it out alive), there is possibly the least convincing performance as a priest in any movie ever (and yes, I have seen Richard Burton in ""Exorcist II""), there is a minor subplot about sorority pledges having to swim in shark lake as part of their initiation, and much more, but you get the idea. The priest's dialogue isn't synched up with the film very well during the crucial exorcism of the demonic shark vampire girl (or whatever she is), but he does, predictably, encounter projectile vomiting (now that's certainly original). The key exorcism scene concludes with the shark plunging from the sky amid fire and explosions because...well, just because. The movie should be over at that point but to pad it out to a 70 minute running time we're treated to a shopping spree where a girl visiting an aquarium goes shopping for as many shark stuffed toys as she can hold. One final note: much of the soundtrack is overpowered by an electronic hum that I guess is supposed to symbolize angst or fear, but really only serves to annoy.

""Shark Exorcist"" is an incoherent mess filled with atrocious dialogue and performances to match, laughable effects, and, sadly, no fun at all. Many outrageous shark movies are fun to watch from a camp perspective, but this one is just trying, making 70 minutes seem much longer than it actually is.",1471564800,8,2579,4.716186252771618

7671827,4,B01C4D5046,"A demonic CG shark has infected the lake of Paris, Tennessee. It has something to do with a nun who appears at the beginning and end of the film. The script and acting was so bad it was funny. I admit I laughed at all the babes and near babes roll around on the ground spouting out idiotic lines. Madison Carney was so bad, she made me howl. Roni Jonah as a shark psychic was also a hoot. The mentally handicapped girl playing with sharks....seriously?

Yes the film was terrible and amateur from start to finish, but I eked out some entertainment from it. For serious bad movie lovers only. What did director Donald Farmer do? ""Girls, read these lines like you can't act."" And what could they possibly spent $300,000 on in this film? It is not as if they closed down the lake, there are boats in the background.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Lots of girls in swim suits....and how big is this shark that it can swim in ankle deep water without showing its dorsal fin?",1470009600,,972,4.3646408839779
7671828,5,B01C4D5046,"Deliciously bad. Completely worth watching for Roni Jonah alone, but you'll have fun with the rest of the cast and the bargain basement special effects as well. A truly inane script, godawful camera work, and the cheesiest score since Troll 2; you should avoid this movie at all costs unless you are a lover of bad cinema or a Roni Jonah fan.

8752197,1,B01C4D5046,"This ""movie"", if you can even call it that, was by far the worst I have ever seen. The opening sequence consisted of blatant stock footage and poor editing. The dialogue came off as awkward, lazy and unnatural. The camera was obviously held by hand instead of a tripod and was constantly shaking. The lighting and overall location that this movie was filmed in wasn't even good or accurate enough to classify the cinematography as mediocre. The story line was just as weak as the dialogue and the acting. This brings me to the ""actors"" ,and I use the term extremely loosely. The vacuity and paucity that the actors project of emotions and reactions are sub-par. I know high school students who can act better. The CGI is laughable at best. It would have been better off using stock footage of a shark attacking prey. All this I could forgive if the movie was made as a satirical film, but it has the audacity to classify itself under horror. Horror movies from 50 years ago are scarier and better written.",1502409600,,1005,4.588888888888889

Spent the majority of the film trying to work out what the hell was going on. It's like the added irrelevant scenes In just to make up time. 20 minutes of it is a woman driving to the lake and relaxing with no dialogue.

8752200,1,B01C4D5046,"With a name like Shark Exorcist I had to give this movie a watch. I wasn't expecting much & I got absolutely nothing at all. It's like somebody got their friends together, decided to make a movie using a home video camera but had a slightly bigger budget than a high school student. This movie was HORRIBLE.After 10-15 minutes I knew I probably, maybe should've turned it off but I wanted to test myself & see if I could make it to the end. I don't know if I did it because I wanted to see how it ended or I wanted to torture myself & watching Shark Exorcist from start to finish without falling asleep was pure torture. If I knew somebody who absolutely **LOVED** BAD movies, I wouldn't even recommend they go see it. Why put someone else what I just went through because I decided to torture myself? I looked up the director on imdb & was expecting that this was his 1st time directing. I was really shocked that he's directed 28 movies since 1987. I wouldn't go searching for any of his other movies but if I came across them, I'd give them a look. That should tell you how much I LOVE BAD movies. The nicest thing I can say about Shark Exorcist is that the best thing about it was the movie poster. It was pretty awesome.
