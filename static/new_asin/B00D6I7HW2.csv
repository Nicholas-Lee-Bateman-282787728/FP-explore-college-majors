8589903,4,B00D6I7HW2,"As others have stated, this DVD transfer is quite terrible. The Cheezy Flicks company certainly isn't known for its quality productions. Poor visuals aside, this movie is downright ridiculous (in a highly entertaining way). Sure, there are plenty of boring segments (long-winded pseudo-science babble and dull political intrigue), but the bee attack scenes are comically awesome. At one point even former US President Gerald Ford is swarmed by the deadly invaders! This movie is so truly awful, it almost borders on PARODY! The soundtrack is horrendous... it sounds like rejected tunes from The A-Team television show. And John Carradine puts on a phony foreign accent (that's reminiscent of an elderly Bela Lugosi). I could list flaws for DAYS, but it's just better if you watch the movie yourself. Hopefully someday a legit distribution company will release this film in a properly restored manner.",1517875200,,900,5.300699300699301

8589908,2,B00D6I7HW2,"This movie's resume is a winner........70's, killer bees, Saxon, Carradine........perfect ingredients.  However, the video transfer is awful.  Still shots are fine, but any sort of motion leads to terrible picture stuttering and chattering.  Forcing yourself to watch it will make you sick to your stomach!  So hooray to Cheezy Flicks for releasing this, but  boo to them for not caring at all about the transfer quality.  Makes Alpha Video transfers look good.......if you buy a lot of DVDs you know what I'm talking about!",1388016000,7,524,5.178571428571429
8589909,1,B00D6I7HW2,"This is the absolute worst transfer I have ever seen in my entire life, and I've even embraced some transfers made from tape masters. A direct VHS-to-DVD transfer could run circles around this travesty. It is a blurry, jagged, mess that can be compared to watching 240p video being streamed on a computer with an extremely slow connection. Avoid this release. It is so unprofessional it should not even be offered by any stores.",1380585600,14,428,4.797297297297297
