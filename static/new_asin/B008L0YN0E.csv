8528821,3,B008L0YN0E,"This collection goes all over the place, zipping through time periods, target ages and, for that matter, continents. It's highly unlikely that Americans at least are nostalgic for any  one of these Christmas offerings. In fact you probably don't remember the shows at all--I didn't, with the exception of ""Heathcliff,"" and the included bonus ""Hey Vern, It's Ernest.""

That isn't to say that the collection is bad; at least not all of it is.

""The Busy World of Richard Scarry"" has two episodes, the second of which is better than most of the rest of this presentation.

With the episodes presented of ""Archie's Weird Mysteries,"" ""Gadget Boy's Adventures in History,"" ""Treasure,"" and ""Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century,"" I found myself asking if any of these ever actually were run in the United States at all; they have the look and feel of European cartoons. The ""Archie"" one is decent, ""Sherlock Holmes"" better. While ""Treasure"" is an interesting inclusion (two episodes of that one, only the second Christmas-themed) it's very ""British"" and not very Christmasy. ""Gadget Boy"" is bad but it's no worse than ""Heathcliff,"" which always was a terrible cartoon.

The included episode of ""Paddington Bear"" is labeled as Christmas but again is very British  and not very Christmasy.

The included ""Hey Vern"" episode isn't about Christmas specifically at all, but a bunch of holidays.

Had  these been the only included episodes I'd have given this just two stars, but the Christmas episodes of ""Sabrina the Animated Series,"" ""Wimzie's House"" and ""Bump in the Night"" are very good, although you couldn't possibly have three more different target audiences for them. ""Wimzie"" is a preschool-level puppet show, ""Sabrina"" is aimed at teens and ""Bump in the Night"" was a failed mid-'90s stop-motion show that aired during prime time on ABC (it lasted a season and a half). But all three are imaginative and very well-done. The ""Bump in the Night"" episode in particular has some genuinely funny moments; it just feels a little bit lengthy. That could be a byproduct of being in a collection with a bunch of 25-minute shows while the run time of this one is upwards of an hour.

All in all, a worthwhile purchase from the bargain bin.",1386460800,2,2224,4.938337801608579
8528822,1,B008L0YN0E,these Christmas cartoons were poorly written and couldn't keep the interest of me or any of my kids or nieces or nephews. worst Christmas cartoons ever. even the Heathcliff cartoon was bad.,1386374400,,189,4.9375
8528823,4,B008L0YN0E,"All episodes in this Cookie Jar exclusive are filled with Holiday cheer and will brighten anyone's spirits. I particularly enjoyed this DVD because of the wide range of cartoons and programs, including the Bump in the Night hour-long Christmas special. Very good value and collection overall! The same bonus Ernest episode is included in the Halloween DVD by Cookie Jar as well.",1383609600,,378,5.112903225806452
8528824,4,B008L0YN0E,My son puts this in his player and watches it over and over again.  He even found Heathclif on the roku becaus of it.  This was a great deal for the assortment of movies.,1359763200,,170,3.9705882352941178
8528825,3,B008L0YN0E,These Videos were ok but nothing really special about most of them. Some like Santa and the 3 Bears were very good.,1356912000,,115,4.2727272727272725
