The films were deteriorated and in early episodes you can see some film damage but the show has been re-mastered and is amazingly clean in sound and image quality.  It is a far cry from the garbled video tape that I watched over the air as a kid.

The best part was how much my 7 and 9 year old kid liked the shows.  It seems to hold up to today's kids short attention spans.  They loved the show.",1267056000,,621,3.92
