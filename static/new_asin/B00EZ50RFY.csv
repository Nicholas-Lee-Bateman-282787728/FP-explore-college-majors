5958057,2,B00EZ50RFY,"I got this movie from Redbox... I got to say ... I'm a bit disappointed with this crap. I thought it was gonna be good with Chris Brown, BUT boy  was I wrong. ! Very Boring. Chris Brown u did your thing but just..NOOo. Plus they took out Chris Brown before the final Battle. SMH
Okay, let's get down to the music.. Very horrible. It's Like elevator music . Very horrible music... should have  picked an awesome soundtrack.. I wonder if the producers actually looked at movies like ""you got served"" before producing this piece of douchebagry.
Wow. thats 2 bucks Im not getting back !",1386892800,,582,4.481132075471698

5958098,5,B00EZ50RFY,"Not a hip hop fan here, so with that said....I thought this was fun and energetic. One question...why in God's name was Chris Brown in this???? The only bad in it. Moving on...the story is typical, not much new here the drunken, down on his luck coach given one more chance to prove himself , done well by Josh Holloway. Caity Lotz as the dance teacher is terrific. The dancers are all superb and the routines and competitions though expected were all great. the stand out performance goes to Josh Peck....watch this guy, he's good and has done other good things.",1399420800,,563,4.584158415841584
5958099,5,B00EZ50RFY,"I've always known Chris Brown was talented, but this is a really good movie. It doesn't even center around his character, but he did such an awesome job, he made him memorable. All of the actors were athletes and awesome. It made me laugh, cry, and want to try some of the things they did. Good job. I enjoyed it a great deal.",1395705600,,326,4.190476190476191

5958101,5,B00EZ50RFY,Josh Holloway and Josh Peck are awesome in this movie about a torn down coach who is hired by a manger of a b-boy crew and wants to enter his crew into the battle of the year completion. but the coach waves off his crew and looks for the best of the best to make them the new crew. and tries to turn them into a team to win the battle of the year. because usa has not won in 15 years so they want to make a comeback. but they gain more in this mission then they expect. this is a awesome movie. the acting and the dancing is amazing. this movie was well directed. I'm just amazed by the dancing in this film. and just amazed by how hard these people work at it. this is a really good movie. probably one of the best dance movies I've seen since step up. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1394236800,2,809,3.8795180722891565
5958102,4,B00EZ50RFY,"This movie was actually a good movie from what I expected. Good acting, great dancing and a good storyline..I have been a fan/part of the bboy scene since the 90s and have somewhat been against commercial bboying but this movie has great bboy legends and does not fall short at all..",1393632000,,283,4.568627450980392

If however, you love ""SYTYCD"", if you love ""ABDC"", if you love all those other dance movies out there you'll dig this as well.

You have to have a lot of talent to do this stuff.  The thing I like best is that they used real BBoys in this movie.  It is not just a lot of dancers trying to BBoy.  I bought 3 copies, 2 for family members.  I have seen it twice and saw things I miised the first time.  I will watch again.",1387238400,7,432,3.8295454545454546
