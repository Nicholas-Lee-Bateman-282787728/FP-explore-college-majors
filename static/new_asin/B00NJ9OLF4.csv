You will get an opportunity to see the actors in action which brought back memories of the great legendary musicians that are no longer with us physically.  But, their legacy lives on forever!

I particularly like the music of W.C. Handy and the details about his life that are featured in this movie.  Also, the music of  Memphis Minnie, Louie Armstrong, Ma' Rainey and the great Bessie Smith is so entertaining.  As a school teacher, I can say that this movie would be an entertaining and informative  teaching tool for history and English teachers.",1504569600,,933,7.601851851851852
