513337,4,6302797543,"Joseph Wambaugh brings a unique perspective to the police movie in that he is a former cop relating personal experiences in his work.  It was rare at the time of the film's release that you saw an up close and personal look at the happenings in the inner cities and barrios.  I also found it refreshing that a film at this time portrays in a thoughtful way interracial romance.  Despite all the positives here, alas, the film I think is slightly undone by the workmanlike direction of journeyman Richard Fleischer(""Dr. Doolittle"").  This film deserved to be helmed by someone like Sidney Lumet(""Serpico""), William Friedkin (""The French Connection"") or Don Siegel(""Dirty Harry"").  Fleisher's direction, at times, barely transcends an episode of ""Adam-12"".  Regardless, this is a worthwhile film highlighted by sterling performances by George C. Scott as a grizzled cop and Stacey Keach as a rookie whose enthusiasm for the job slowly evolves into despair.  Interesting to note the prescence of James B. Sikking(""Hill Street Blues"") and Erik Estrada ""C.H.I.P.S."").  Wambaugh would be done justice a few years later with a television version of ""The Blue Knight"" starring William Holden.  Thankfully, ""The Choirboys"" isn't available on disc.",1223078400,,1238,5.275510204081633
513338,4,6302797543,"This is the neglected big screen version of Joseph Wambaugh's landmark novel and it holds up really well.  The format shifts from that of the book as I recall it, and instead of following three rookies as they come on the force we mainly get a dual portrait of an old-timer and one of the newbies.  There are some effective episodes and the filmmakers are ahead of the curve in depicting the underlying racial tensions of the L.A. streets.  (Although these scenes are diluted a bit by some of the stereotypes of the performances.)  The two leads are very effective though.  Keach carries the picture with his intense earnestness and Scott's final scene is one long take that's a knockout.",1222992000,2,688,4.7
513339,5,6302797543,"If you like police movies, you'll love this one. Stacy Keach and Erik Estrada (CHiPs, in one of his first movies) are graduates of the police academy as they begin their careers within the police department. Of special interest is the relationship between Keach and George C. Scott (a seasoned veteran looking forward to retirement).

This is a true-to-life story of cops and their daily struggles as they balance their jobs with their personal life. George C. Scott is excellent in this movie and worth watching for his acting alone. Stacy Keach gives a great performance as a new cop juggling family and his quest to further his career beyond the police department.

Plenty of action sequences and a true depiction of the struggles that our police force face on a daily basis. Watch Erik Estrada in one of his earliest roles.

A must see movie for action, drama, and life on the streets. I own the VHS version and I am glad that this movie was finally released on DVD. A true classic.",1219968000,12,986,4.655172413793103
513340,3,6302797543,"I had read the book in addition to seeing this movie and was somewhat disappointed.

The book had been equally about three Los Angeles police officers, Serge Duran, (Erik Estrada), Gus Plebesly (Scott Wilson) and Roy Fehler (Stacey Keach).  The movie primarily focuses on Roy Fehler and leaves very small roles for Gus and Serge, whose characters were important in the story.

In spite of this, it was still a good movie that was educational and entertaining.  George C. Scott was great in the role of Kilvinsky and was exactly as I pictured the character.  The movie evolves around day to day situations from petty crimes to violent crimes.

The ending is sad.  I don't want to give that away, but the best part was when Erik Estrada prays the Hail Mary in Spanish, which makes the movie more touching than any I have seen.

I recommend this movie for anyone who likes cop movies.",1214524800,7,881,4.638709677419355
513341,5,6302797543,"I totally agree that this movie should be formatted into the DVD mode.

513344,5,6302797543,"This movie inspired me to a law enforcement career that lasted 28 years. George C. Scott (Officer Kilvinsky) delivers one of his best performances as a veteran patrolman of the L.A.P.D. He teaches a rookie cop ""Stacy Keach"" how to survive on the streets of L.A. Erik Estrada plays a former gang banger that turned cop, only to find himself working patrol in his old stomping grounds. The realism was great. No doubt they used police advisors when making the film. A sad movie that will make you realize that cops are human. Kilvinsky the cynical cop, shows compassion in dealing with illegal Mexican immigrants that are being taken advantage of by a money grubbing landlord. Stacy Keach suffers a failed marriage and gets involved in an interracial relationship. Truly a gut wrenching movie that shows the brutality of police work, both mentally and physically. I'd pay a hundred dollars if I could get the movie on DVD.",1058572800,31,920,4.829113924050633

513476,4,6302797543,"Story line, such as it is: three L.A. police officers newly graduated from the academy are each partnered with a hardened veteran and a patrol car, and quickly exposed to all the dark stuff the city can throw at them. There are armed robberies, gang fights, drug busts, rowdy hookers, belligerent arrestees, high speed car chases and child neglect, with an additional unpleasant look into the personal problems such contact engenders. It's all here in loud and dirty detail, basically in lieu of story or character development. The latter two things which I thought were handled better in the preceding best-selling novel by ex-cop Joseph Wambaugh.

None of that makes this a deficient movie. Back when Hollywood was just beginning to roll on its efforts toward greater authenticity in action films, the ""New Centurions"" depiction was a welcome reality check, startling enough to make it one of 1972's top grossing films. It's lost some of that shock value forty-odd years later, but Stacy Keach's portrayal of newbie officer Roy Fehler and George C. Scott as his veteran partner Andy Kilvinsky are still impressive, as are the moody night shift urban scenes. Worth seeing.",1432339200,,1173,5.077720207253886

513485,4,6302797543,"This 1972 film is about the inner feelings and personal lives of four policemen working for the LAPD. It is as relevant today as when it was made. It sends a very important message to society. The focus of the film is the emotional impact which the job has on specific individuals. Each of them deals very differently with the unexpected situations they encounter during their work life and therefore the residual feelings which remain hidden or buried is dealt with differently by each individual as well. The lives of these policemen are interwoven, as they are a team, doing a job for society, ensuring laws are followed and society as a whole is kept safe. George C. Scott plays Andy Kivinsky, a veteran police officer with 25 years on the job. He is partnered with Roy Fehler (played by Stacy Keach) who is a rookie. It is department policy to train new guys to this complex job in this manner and it makes sense. Roy is assigned to the Vice Squad which places great strains on his marriage causing it to end. Initially, Roy had planned to attend law school but due to life's twists and turns, he got married and had a daughter and the realities of earning a living led him into law enforcement as a job. The accusations which fly between Roy and his wife as they break up is superbly acted and provides insights into how a marriage with a solid foundation eventually becomes shaken and falters to the breaking point. Kivinsky was retiring after 25 years of service in the police force. At the farewell party, it is evident he has mixed feelings about leaving, perhaps unresolved issues. He was heavily invested in the relationships with his fellow officers. His plan are to retire to Florida where his family resides.

In order to mask his true feelings of depression, Roy Fehler began to drink. It became a problem because he even resorted to taking the occasional gulp of courage while on the job. Gus Plebesly, played by Scott Wilson, is his new partner who caught Roy breaking this code of conduct related to his job. Gus is a father and family man who takes his role as provider and family man seriously. He was taking night courses at the academy to qualify for a promotion and become a sergeant. He became Roy's partner after Klivinsky retired. Gus had Roy's back and he supported his partner, trying to help him work through his personal problems more effectively. Klivinsky returns to LA from Florida to visit with his old friends but everyone seems too busy to socialize with him. Klivinsky drops a few hints on the telephone about the difficulties he has living with his family and coping with retirement. It falls on deaf ears. He wrestles with his personal demons and sadly, in the end, the demons won.

While on assignment to investigate a burglary, Roy and Gus interview Lorrie the victim of a robbery. Lorrie reads Roy's name tag and recognizes his name but he has no recollection of their having met. She asks him, ""How are you?"" to which he replies, ""Not so good."" She reveals that when he was hospitalized, she and the other nurses did not expect him to survive the wounds he sustained on the job. They made an unexpected personal connection that each recognized could lead to something more meaningful. However, just when Roy Fehler feels his life is coming together in a good way, fate intervenes once more. The reader will have to view the film to discover the new twist in Roy's life which changes his life course forever.

This film is a rare gem which treats sensitive issues in the lives of policemen in a very respectful and dignified manner, revealing the day to day struggles they face in their chosen profession. The film does not exaggerate their role. It does not portray them as super heroes nor does it vilify them. The impression left on me is that men with different strengths and qualities are drawn into this profession for their own personal reasons and they work very hard to perform their duties for society to the best of their abilities. Policemen come from all segments of society and like all human beings deserve to be respected and treated with dignity, despite what is reported by the modern media, no profession should be judged by the actions of a few.

I still find it highly entertaining, and the performances are all top notch with special kudos to the late, great George C. Scott.  Equal parts compassionate, fear inducing ( slum lords beware ! ), and sympathetic, Scott's veteran cop Andy Kilvinsky is one of his best roles ever, I think, and was grossly overlooked at the time,.And for those who might be into ""The Walking Dead,"" it's interesting to see a very young Scott Wilson, quite good in the ( underwritten ) role of rookie patrolman Gus Plebesly.

513596,4,6302797543,"The New Centurions, 1972 film

This was adapted from the book by Joseph Wambaugh, a former Los Angeles policeman. We see police candidates going through their training and exercise. An experienced policeman starts his tour with a rookie policeman. We see example of the problems encountered by the police, and the solutions. [That figure of $11,000 a year dates this movie.] Andy Kilvinski explained how he identified the suspect. [Subtle clues in behavior or instinct?] They patrol the red light district (its hard to convict a prostitute). Kilvinski knows how to deal with them. So does the rookie partner. [How reliable are their stories?] A man tells of being robbed by a man with a gun. The police find a suspect, there are shots. Was it the wrong man? ""Call an ambulance!"" Next a mother with a neglected child. What will happen to her child? [Does poverty cause these problems?]

Kilvinski says its best to put your time in (20 years) then retire. Taylor has a problem with his wife's attitude. ""I'm sorry."" She misses him, he is on the Night Watch. A pick-up truck runs a red light. The driver doesn't cooperate (at first). Kilvinski notices something wrong about a shop. ""211 in progress."" There is a surprise! Roy will be out in five weeks, light duty, then back out on the streets. Next they investigate a gun charge related to rent collection. Kilvinski acts for justice here. Two policemen respond to a silent alarm, a robbery in progress. One robber grabs a hostage and shoots at the police. A bad career move. Kilvinski puts in his papers after 25 years. He complains about the changes in the laws. ""You will never get rid of evil due to human nature."" Andy says there is always a need for watchmen to hold the line. Tonight is ""trash patrol"", they search garbage cans for betting slips. They look for fruits to arrest, like a lumberjack from Oregon. Its only a fine.

A walk in the park at night results in an arrest. Roy's wife tell him she is leaving him. ""I just don't care anymore"" says Dorothy. Kilvinski returns to say hello. Is he dissatisfied with his life? [Shouldn't he have found a hobby or interest that helped people?] Roy is sorrowful, and takes a drink. They answer a complaint about a domestic robbery. Roy has a drink. This woman met Roy before at the hospital. Roy uses the call box, his partner complains. Roy questions a woman in a car; there is big trouble now. Can he be brushed off? Roy returns to see that nurse. She will take care of him. Next they answer a call about a disturbance. Shots are fired, another gunman arrested. The windows of a car are broken! They answer a call for a domestic disturbance. The man shoots a policeman, then surrenders. Roy is hit again, bad, from this surprise attack.

I didn't read the book so I can't say how accurate this movie is. It seems realistic about the difficulties of a policeman's lot in a big city. Isn't it different in a small town? Are things different today? Does it have a lesson for the audience? Do they have a program for stressed policemen today? The movie is a collection of scenes, there is no coherent story like in most movies. Think of ""The Fugitive"".",1373760000,,3152,4.593250444049733
513597,3,6302797543,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1972 and thought it was great. I recently decided to add this movie to my collection and after watching it in 2013, WOW was I wrong. The late, great George C. Scott plays a over the hill LAPD cop ready for retirement, its doesn't work, not after seeing Scott doing Patton and many other great roles. The Quincy Jones score as great as it was at the time is very dated and helps one to loose interest in what's happening. Stacy Keach is the new ""Hair bag"" on the job and is trying to learn from Scott. He plays the role well. The ending is fairly predictable. If Gen. Patton were alive today he would take a flame thrower to this flick. :(",1369094400,,675,4.121212121212121
513598,5,6302797543,This is one of Wambaugh's best novel and the movie was great. If you like George C. Scott and Stacy Keach you will like this movie. They make a great dynamic duo. I highly recommend this movie!,1364601600,,193,4.243243243243243
513599,5,6302797543,"This flick with George C Scott and Stacey Keach is a bit dated watching it today but its a good vid showing the frustration of police on the street at the time it was filmed. Seeing a cop back in the squad car after a shooting, roughing up a despicable slumlord....you know that would never happen today...maybe. Missing was the review boards wanting to put Keach and Scott in jail.
I saw this movie when it first came to the theater. ...loved it then, love it now.",1363305600,2,465,4.35632183908046
513600,5,6302797543,I saw this movie as a junior in high school in the early 70's when it came out at the show. I was captivated by it. When I walked out of the theater I knew I wanted a career as a police officer. I thought of this movie often during my 37 years in law enforcement.,1362960000,,263,3.7142857142857144

513602,4,6302797543,This was and still is a good movie for the time frame it represented. I saw it when it was new in 1972 & it ran on TV for many years. It presented itself as a capsule of good cops & bad cops & some in between just trying to do their job in an element that they felt overwhelmed in. It's still a good story if you are interested in the 60's & 70's street cop experience.,1359331200,,369,3.7435897435897436

513604,4,6302797543,The New Centurions is based on the excellent novel of Joseph Wambaugh who was a police officer at the time he wrote it. The book is well written and detailed and the film is quite a good representation of the book. Watching this film for the first time in over 30 years you don't get the sense of it being dated. I'm sure it would be a great film for police officers going through their initial training on route to the world of the beat. It is a good film and holds up well and should have more kudos than it does. Stacey Keach gives an accurate portrayal of the new policeman while George C. Scott does a great job of the world weary veteran. The ending is one you don't expect and keeps you thinking afterwards for some time.,1351987200,3,728,4.207142857142857

513626,4,6302797543,"...but it really doesn't quite make it. I even suspect that the screenwriter understood that putting this amazing story into a movie was too tall of an order. So he purposefully narrowed his look into the lives of the three rookie cops and almost loses Officer Gus and the Watts Riots all together in the process.

But that's okay. It is nevertheless a very good movie with George C. Scott very nearly stealing the show from the others. Stacy Keach portrays the rise and fall of a rookie to veteran in almost haunting fashion. This is very entertaining from start to finish.

Bottom line is that Wambaugh's book ""The New Centurions"" was just really deep and well done. Only a mini series with a lot of production money could have captured it all. So this movie is an abbreviation, but a good one.",1339200000,2,796,4.559440559440559
513627,3,6302797543,A run-of the-mill and highly predictable police saga with lots of stereotypes and few surprises.  Minorities and women are not portrayed in a particulary flattering way.,1245110400,,169,5.5
513628,5,6302797543,"I must admit that I have never heard of this movie before, I was only a few years old when it came out and only came about it by accident.  I'm a big fan of 70's and 80s police shows and movies and mainly purchased this due to Erik Estrada of CHIPS fame.  The acting was great especially the leads, Stacy Keach and George C Scott, but had great supporting performances from Estrada, Jane Alexander, and Isabel Sanford of THE JEFFERSONS tv show.  What sets this apart from other police movies is that the characters and situations are more real and believeable, not over the top action sequences, though the film does have moments of action and chases.  The characters are very real, not 2 dimensional cliches of cops or bad guys.  You don't have to be a police officer to enjoy but if you are, you'll understand and sympathize more.  The film is enjoyable for anyone, and with the exception of some fashions, music and more technological advances in law enforcement, this film stands the test of time.",1237420800,,1001,4.564245810055866
513629,5,6302797543,"This is a favorite movie of mine. The casting was superb. Outstanding performances by all especially George C. Scott. I believe this was one of Scott's (Kilvinski) best acted but least heralded roles. He played the grizzled, wily vet passing on valuable knowledge and experience to the ""wet behind the ears,"" rookie cop. It reminded me of my experiences with veteran F.T.O's. The sixth sense that vets developed during their careers was something to behold and aspire to. I have a lot of respect and admiration for the officers who spent most if not their entire career on the streets. That is what George C. Scott successfully portrayed. Kudos to the young Stacy Keach (Fehler) whose character matures and becomes jaded during the course of the movie. I believe this was Erik Estrada's best dramatic performance unlike the over-the-top, ""CHiP's"" character that he became famous for. One of the jewels in this film is Clifton James' portrayal of the crafty ""Whitey"" Duncan. The unique way he handles the domestic disturbance between the dysfunctional married couple, in front of his trainee (Scott Wilson), was not only hilarious but demonstrates the ability of cops who can think on their feet. James B. Sikking plays the overly ambitious,ladder climbing, and glory seeking vice sergeant who is oblivious to his subordinates' needs other than his own. This is a very realistic movie in terms of character portrayals, situations, and the dreaded fall outs of this job: divorce, suicide and being killed in the line of duty. Anyone wanting to be entertained with laughter, and emotion, plus gaining insight on what a cop faces on a day-to-day basis should view this film.",1236470400,2,1670,5.0324909747292415

513632,5,6302797543,"The screenplay adapted from the Joseph Wambaugh novel of the same name brings us brilliant performances from Stacy Keach as an idealistic rookie paired with seasoned veteran LAPD cop George C. Scott.  As I remember seeing this movie when I was in college, it left a lasting impression of the rigid & cynical examination of law and order in 1970's Los Angeles.

513634,5,6302797543,"I've been waiting on this to be released on dvd for literally years! My vhs copy has gotten a lot of use. This is one of the BEST 70's/BEST all around cop films I've seen and I'm very particular. Ranks right up there along with Electraglide in Blue, Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Serpico, McQ and Seven-Ups. The book by ex-LA cop Joseph Wambaugh is one of his best and the film follows it rather closely. It starts out with Stacy Keach and his fellow officers going through the academy, he becomes a rookie cop and is partnered with veteran George C. Scott. I'll not give the excellent plot away, but the film is very accurate in its portrayal of late 60's, 70's police activities and their equipment. Shades of Adam-12 in that respect. Overall a truly excellent movie that will not disappoint you, especially if you are into cop movies...and if you like it, you should consider reading the fine book too (if you've read the book and like it, you MUST see the film)! A classic!",1223596800,3,983,4.52808988764045
513635,5,6302797543,"This has been one of my favourite cop/action movies. My vhs copy always looked fuzzy and faded, so I'm glad to see this movie in widescreen and with vibrant colours.  The Martini Movies supplements are silly and not worth looking at.

It is 1972 and fellow cops Stacey Keach and George C. Scott are on the night shift making the rounds in their squad car or paddy wagon. They end up being forced to come to terms between their personal lives and their consuming and often dangerous professional life. It is a pleasure to see these two fine actors in one film. Quincy Jones' funky score thankfully doesn't overwhelm the unfolding drama.
