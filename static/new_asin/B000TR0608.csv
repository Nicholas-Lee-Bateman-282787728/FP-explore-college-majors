8210397,5,B000TR0608,"After watching this presentation, I was really surprised at how little real information about UFOs and the technology associated with it makes it to the public. I am certain this documentary most have covered over a hundred topics related to UFOs and Aliens. I especially enjoyed the information and stories about UFO technology from the Philadelphia Experiment and Montauk Project. The story about the invisible military aircraft that took off in 1966 and time traveled to 1982 really freaked me out! You gotta see this.",1229731200,2,521,5.141176470588236
