8167553,1,B00008AOW6,"This movie reminds me of a chocolate peanut... once you get through the sweet outer shell,you end up with the dry,dull peanut inside. Although it does have all the usual delicious  eye candy one see in other Bel Ami productions (Lucas,Johan,etc), it most certainly doesn't have any of the allure... The director clearly had a very bad day...the music's extremely cheesy, the scene's badly shot and composed....and just as you think something's finally gonna happen...well... it never does.

Being an avid Bel Ami fan...this is definately NOT a movie I'll keep with the rest of my collection. It would certainly be the bad apple amongst them!",1122076800,9,641,5.037735849056604
