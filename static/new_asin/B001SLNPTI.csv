3785693,5,B001SLNPTI,"I have been waiting for Transformers on DVD at the right price. Since they were first released from Rhino, who doesn't have the rights for Sunbow/Marvel, the prices were around $60. I say, ""What?!?!"" I didn't even bother buying those. I have been waiting for the prices to be drop but it didn't happen and ever since out of print. Sony was about to do the series after the movie came to DVD, they lost the rights and Hasbro bought all their cartoons based on toys programs for a good amount. Now, Shout Factory! got the series and will be out this summer. YES! This is a must have for nostalgic fans, just like myself. I definitely recommend this set. This is one of my all-time favorite childhood cartoons ever made. Fans, transform and BUY IT!!!!!!!",1236816000,3,751,4.529411764705882

3785702,5,B001SLNPTI,"Always reminisce when I see a retro cartoon from the 80's. As campy as it was, this was a great show of good and evil. This was campy, outlandish, and ridiculous with its dialogue, but when your six or seven years old, what do you care. All you want to see at that age is the Autobots ( the good guys) beat the Deceptacons ( the bad guys) and win the day.. Good fun, especially when you can enjoy watching it with your six year old son.",1475625600,,436,4.022988505747127

3785709,5,B001SLNPTI,"Man, did watching this with my kids ever bring back form great memories. My kids like Rescue Bots. (It's pretty good as far as Transformer shows go) but I wanted to show them the original Saturday Morning Cartoon version of Transformers.

For me it was a blast from the past. It's a great classic cartoon that held up well for me over time. It's just a well told story. Even if the animation isn't up to today's standards, it's still an entertaining show.

As for my kids, who have grow up in a nearly completely CGI entertainment world, they still loved this original! They were glued to the TV.

I really enjoyed watching this again. It was also amazing how fast it all came back to me. Things like how Starscream is always looking for his moment to overthrow Megatron. Also these versions of the Autobots and Decepticons just look cooler than the live action CGI movie versions. And Bumblebee as a Volkswagon instead of a Camero just makes me so happy.",1472947200,5,955,4.540697674418604

3785819,5,B001SLNPTI,"There is a certain giddiness that goes with the Transformers and G.I. Joe cartoons from the mid 80's.  The animation isn't great and the stories have some obvious plot holes, but the 9 year old in me doesn't care.  My four year old son seem to agree even though he has only known Bumblebee as a Camaro.",1449014400,,302,4.280701754385965
3785820,5,B001SLNPTI,"I adore Generation One transformers, and its a shame that there no highquality broadcast tapes left of it.  Much like many other cartoons of the time, there's animation errors galore, degraded quality of tape which causes graininess, pixilation, and blurry frames.  This is to be expected from a cartoon from this era, so I'm not too bummed by this.
There's just something about G1 transformers that's undeniably nostalgic, even for people like me, who grew almost 10 years after its original airing and didn't touch transformers media until my 20's.  Genertation One is a trip, with very little plot, silly voice acting, a vast array of characters made for toy sales, and shoddy pseudoscience, but i'll be damned I love it to bits.",1446422400,3,732,4.934959349593496

I loved that show when I was a kid and I'm glad to be able to show it to my kids. they love it. and I don't feel as if they are more violent or physical after seeing this. they just think of situations where they would need the autobots. and the voice acting is wonderful. just iconic voices that you always remember as Prime and Megatron.,1407542400,,414,4.1234567901234565

His mom likes it too since the violence and language/phrases are not as rough as today's version.
Our youngest son came home & watched it with his nephew, and proceeded to tell us he would like to have this as well. What a surprise!! A great idea for anyone who remembers them.",1394582400,,589,4.175438596491228

Sure they use tape drives and the technology portrayed is old, but the quality of the cartoon just doesn't have that old feel.

Firstly, presentation is amazing. The video is clean, reds are red, not too orange. The sound is nicer. And my personal favorite feature is he ability to play multi part episodes as a single episode. As a fan the first season is really the one to own, and the second season has the better animation for the most part. I was so impressed with the quality of the box I immediately sought out the collector's edition in the MAtrix box and add the single season box to my nephew's collection.",1377648000,,647,4.436974789915967

3785928,5,B001SLNPTI,"Transformers is my all-time favorite animated series, period.  I love everything from Generation 1 to Beast Machines (including the Japanese series), but not necessarily every minute of it.  I was born in 1989, so while I never saw it on TV, I caught it on VHS.  There was no greater thrill felt at a rental store than when I found a new episode of Transformers.  Out of all the things I rented, it was the one new thing I knew would be good.  It's about giant robots that can transform, what's cooler than that I thought at age 5.  And when Beast Wars started on TV, I was hooked for life.  Then Rhino started releasing the original series on VHS, & I collected every one of the tapes.  But now they're all gone, since I got the series on the Rhino DVDs, then double-dipped for the Shout Factory ones (I got them all cheap, so it wasn't that bad).

This series is awesome.  Beast Wars is my favorite, but the pre-Movie episodes of the original are my second favorite (the post-Movie episodes are fourth, after the Japanese series Victory).  Transformers was one of the edgiest 80s cartoons.  Although characters didn't die, being robots they could get hurt badly but be put back together no worse for wear.  And the characters, although half of them were there because they had toys to sell, all had very interesting personalities and distinctive voices.  A couple characters didn't really do anything, but it's impressive how many do.  This season isn't as good as season 2, but it's still darn good all things considering.  This contains all the episodes I rented, & it's a joy to watch them over & over again (well, most of them anyways).

Most of the synopsizes come from Wikipedia, with a little editing here & there.

1-3. More Than Meets The Eye:  The 3 part pilot, about how the Autobots & Decepticons came from Cybertron, crashed into Earth & slept for 4 million years, then reawakened to do battle again & how the Autobots befriended the human Spike.  It's good, but not quite the high point of the series.  A little too much of it clashes with what would be established later, but that's mostly in the first part.  Parts 2 & 3 are excellent however, & make up for the first part.  A-

4. Transport To Oblivion:  Returning to Cybertron with energy is the Decepticons' top priority. The new space bridge could do that, but it has problems like possibly being fatal to whoever tries to go through it. Finding where the Decepticons are hiding, Bumblebee and Spike discover what they are doing only they don't have a chance to warn Optimus. The Decepticons instead have nasty plans for them. A space bridge trip awaits Spike, while a little reprogramming on Bumblebee threatens to see the Decepticons finally destroy the other Autobots.  My least favorite of the single episodes.  It's not bad, but I wonder why out of all the episodes they picked the script for this one as a special feature.  Maybe because it was a little different, but still they could have at least picked a better one, like... B

5. Roll For It: This one!  With Megatron assumed dead, Starscream seizes power and does things his way. Naturally, only the Autobots benefit from his 'command' style. This also gives Bumblebee and Spike time to relax with Chip Chase. They end up getting involved in a scientist's new anti-matter experiments. Megatron is back and again in charge of the Decepticons. It turns out that he has big plans for the anti-matter meaning big trouble for everyone, especially Chip.  This was the first episode I ever saw, and it's a really good one.  A+

6. Divide & Conquer:  The Autobots prevent the Decepticons from harming a weapons factory, but at a heavy price: Optimus himself. His life is on the line, but Wheeljack knows exactly how to save him before it's too late. Problem is, the required part is back on Cybertron in his old laboratory. Bumblebee, Trailbreaker, Ironhide, Bluestreak, and Chip Chase leave to save Optimus because without him in command, the Autobots are left vulnerable.  This is a pretty exciting episode.  A-

7. Fire In the Sky:  Megatron believes that the key to a Decepticon victory lies in the North Pole, but quite suddenly not just via a new energy scheme. The brilliant, frozen Skyfire awaits, and it turns out he has been there for millions of years. It also turns out that he and Starscream shared something of a friendship in the past, something he hasn't forgotten since he joins the Decepticons.  This is one of the high points of the whole season.  Skyfire is a great character, and the action in this episode is just great, especially the sword fight between Optimus Prime & Megatron.  A+

8. S.O.S. Dinobots:  A little extra muscle in the Autobot ranks would certainly be welcome. Coincidentally, nearby dinosaur fossils provide the necessary means. Soon enough, Wheeljack unveils Grimlock, Slag and Sludge. Their poor intelligence and great strength make for an uncomfortable combination. Optimus sees all of this as a mistake shutting down the Dinobots before they can harm themselves or anyone else. However, a sudden and devastating Decepticon attack prompts reconsidering this policy.  Any episode with the Dinobots in it is good, & this is no exception.  A

9.  Fire On the Mountain:  There is a crystal of massive power out there in Peru.  Both sides become aware of it and the Decepticons reach it first.  It can power a weapon destructive enough to eliminate the Autobots and decide the fate of Earth once and for all.  Only Windcharger, Brawn and Skyfire are in range to stop them before it's too late.  Next to heavy Metal War, this is my favorite episode on the set.  A+

10. War of the Dinobots:  Certainly, the Dinobots give the Autobots something of an advantage over the Decepticons in battle. Naturally, Megatron wants that advantage to be his instead. That doesn't prove very difficult to do, so the Autobots are soon facing the battle fury of Grimlock, Slag & Sludge.  The only chance of setting things right lies with the construction and success of the newest set of Dinobots, Snarl & Swoop.  2 new Dinobots & a great story.  What more could you ask for?  A

11.-13.  The Ultimate Doom.  With the help of the human Dr. Archeval, the Decpticons build a space bridge that teleports Cybertron into Earth's orbit.  This causes the weather to wild, & with the help of humans brainwashed by the Dr., including Spike's father Sparkplug, they collect the energy unleashed by this.  Aside from how small Cybertron is (I always pretend that it's just moved closer to Earth & that it wouldn't just fit in Earth's atmosphere) this is an excellent multi-part episode.  A

14.  Countdown To Extinction:  It seems like things are back to normal, but Starscream is about to shake everything up. Dangerous equipment from Dr. Arkeville's laboratory is capable of granting him more power than even he can imagine. Problem is, if Starscream isn't stopped, everyone on Earth will die in the process and Cybertron will be his.  This is a very good epilogue to The Ultimate Doom.  A

15. A Plague of Insecticons:  The Insecticons have come to Earth. They certainly give the Autobots and the Decepticons good reason to take notice. The Insecticons have more in common with the latter than the former. These collective enemies don't scare the Autobots into submission, but bravery is hardly enough. Faced with such sheer power, the Autobots must rely on their intelligence and all of their resources to win.  The Insecticons are some of the greatest villains in this series.  A

16. Heavy Metal War:  The war gets more crowded with the sudden introduction of the Constructicons. However, rather than simply just providing raw numbers, they serve a greater purpose for Megatron. Their construction ingenuity ultimately gives Megatron every unique ability his team possesses. Of course, Optimus Prime is his primary target and in official combat. Per the terms, the loser must take his team off Earth forever. Given Megatron's current power and the Autobots being kept in the dark about it, how can Optimus possibly win this challenge?
This is an awesome episode to end the season on.  A+

So that comes to only 3 episodes below A, one of which is A-.  This is a show I honestly think stands the test of time.  There honestly hasn't been a time in my life since seeing it that I haven't liked it.",1365811200,,8336,4.742002781641168

He hasn't even opened his disk set, and it has been retired to our movie shelf rather than in the office where he normally watches tv. SOOO, maybe it wasn't as good of a gift as I thought it'd be.

But I know that there would be nothing wrong with the disks, and this is a restored version of the cartoon, so it's a little better quality. Also, this was fairly inexpensive when I bought it. $11-$15.

Where the Transformers came from

Why the Transformers came to earth
Why Cyberton was critical to their existance

All in all it's a great cartoon that you don't have to be concerned about sharing with other family members. It's family friendly entertainment in a world where reality TV has taken over the airwaves.  We need more cartoons like this with values and life lessons that entertain.

3785955,5,B001SLNPTI,"This review is for those of us that bought the Rhino sets the first time around. I have been debating, for awhile now, if it is worth replacing the Rhino sets with Shout! Factory's re-release. So far I have purchased this one and the first part of season 2. Comparing the two I like the cover, case, and dvd better on the Shout! re-release with more of the character art. Rhino did have the cool art on the inside panorama but the rest were just the symbols of the factions and the merging autobot symbol throughout the sets on the cover.

As for the episodes I might be a big fan but I might not be hardcore enough to notice some of the subtle differences mentioned. Other than it being a little bit darker there are some fixes, somethings the same, somethings that didn't work like they might of wanted it to. Like the sound mix being low in some episodes as compared to the Rhino release. To me as long as the episodes are still fun and still very watchable it is a good set.

Besides the art, the one other main thing that finally sold me on getting these sets is the compactness of the newer re-release. The set is packed very good for the price and not stacked on top of each other on one spindal or in stacked baggy like sleeves or laying on sandwiched cardboard sleeves like some other cheaper dvd releases are. I do like that Shout! did their re-release in four sets instead of Rhino's five. The best thing, once I have all four sets, is that it will take up no more space than two of Rhino's sets.

The beginning, the creation of the Dinobots, the discovery of Skyfire (Jetfire), even the episode in which the original 3 Decepticon Jets nearly took out Optimus Prime, the Insecticons (which I don't recall seeing to fruition due to viewing conflicts) and the All Powered Megatron episode that I may barely remember seeing, if at all! While the Movie alone had the voice of the late Orson Welles, even the early episodes of the series included the late Scatman Crothers as Jazz, the multi character voices of Casey Kasem and the ever true voice of Optimus - Peter Cullen. I know I'm not quite listing everything, but that would take a lot more space and give spoilers to those whom may not have already seen this. But we know that our kids would have seen what we watched way back when, according to our generation, if the means were possible! I love this series. Of course, there are more of my favorite episodes in the seasons to come! The Thinpak style of packaging is sometimes Great (as it is with this set). Speaking of such, I don't really like 2-sided DVDs (which this collection thankfully doesn't have). An episode guidebook is included, making it easy to distinguish your favorite episodes that you know where to look.

Though the show was intended to be a 3 part mini series, but due to fans wanting more of Transformers and they did.  While the first season of Transformers Generation 1 set the stone in what the other Transformers show had to live up with the high expectations.  This season set takes any Transformers fan back to the time when big fighting robots was a big thing and possibly help bring a newer generation of fans into the fandom.

3785963,3,B001SLNPTI,"I kinda figured this would happen. That Shout! Factory would release individual DVDs one by one and have them
sit on shelves until the sales taper off. Then unleash the motherload of Generation 1 series in one box set.
But I still bit and bought this DVD along with the second one. The Matrix edition is a far greater value and
it is housed in nice packaging. If you only want one DVD, then this is the one to get. Aside from the cartoon
itself, what sets this apart were the extras. the Triple Changer feature will give you an insight on how the
Transformers universe was created. You get to see interviews with people who conceived the ideas of the names
of the robots and the back story. Everything from the comic book, the cartoons, and of course the toys.
I thought it was very interesting. But in the Matrix edition, you get that and even more. Even interviews
with some of the voice cast. Both of these DVDs are published by Shout! so I'm not diverting any of their business
away by saying to go for the Matrix edition. To me, it's a much better value than this one DVD.

3785969,4,B001SLNPTI,"Overall, great release.  Everything that has been said by others I will not repeat.  I think what Shout! did is they took the best master of every scene.  This means there should be no more color goofs (like Rhino), unless of course back in the 80s a scene was never corrected.  This also means the picture quality will not be consistent for some eps, like for instance ""Heavy Metal War"".  This particular ep the varying of the picture quality is really noticeable, but overall it's not a distraction.

What you are getting for the price makes this a great value.  If you missed the Rhino, by all means pick up this one.

I should point out I did not get a magnet in mine.  That's the reason I bumped down the score from 5 to 4 stars.  Did anyone else not get theirs?  Maybe it really is ""limited edition""?

Keep in mind this is the original 1984 series and not the newer series that have come out in recent years. This is where it all started spawning many series spin-offs, a full length animated movie and the two recent live action movies.

The only major problem I had with this set is with the sound effects on the last 4 episodes. They are turned down way to low and hardly audible. This is disappointing since it really takes away from the mood of the show. I highly doubt it, but I would hope that Shout! would fix this problem and issue a replacement disc.

Part of it I think is because of the voices and sound effects and of course the whole concept of the transformations of everyday objects into robots that think for themselves. However the animation is of the poor quality that seems to be in the majority of television and direct to DVD projects.

With the recent release of the theatrical movie I was curious to find out why I liked the original cartoon so much (me being a middle aged adult). The basic premise is good against evil, the survial of the earth and its inhabitants. My original draw to the series (reasons stated above) still stand but I seem to be more aware of the production short comings this time around.

Young children seem to like the whole robot thing and enjoy this cartoon series. But be aware that some of the story line can be somewhat violent and frightening when the ""bad guys"" Decepticons are involved.",1251244800,,936,4.632530120481928

With this, you only get one audio option and that's 2.0 stereo. On the Rhino release, you get all three. Also, originally I thought the picture was better, but it's actually not as good. It's darker and doesn't have as much contrast. Also, it doesn't have that many bonus features. Anyway, I will give you the good things about this release. It's cheaper and has different special features. Also, it's more compact so it doesn't take as much room on your shelf.

Some scenes seemed to be having lots of noise around characters, like artifacting or something not sure what term to use.

So there are positive and negative things to say about this release.  The animation really is not up to dvd quality though if taken from 1980's broadcast mastered that were interlaced.  So now i understand why there is no blu ray release as some have asked for because these are digitally cleaned up versions of what you had on vhs.

Me personally i would like to have the old rhino release again that i used to own and gave away.  That release with fixing the animation errors and audio fixed would have been the definitive version.

You know some transformers fan will take bot dvd and produce for themselves the ultimate version.

The audio seems a bit off too because they made a monaural track into fake stereo.  I would have preferred two channel mono instead of playing around with the sound levels and trying to force stereoization where none existed in the digital realm without having access to the original audio master session multi track tapes.

Optimus Prime's voice lacks the bombast i remember from the original broadcasts.  In one scene he sounded like his voice was sped up or something like i was watching a pal masterered dvd instead of ntsc.",1246579200,5,1471,4.658914728682171

I haven't really sat down and compared the original against this, but I don't see much difference in the two besides the 3rd disc which has extras. I still see (& hear) lots of mistakes, so I don't know where they really fixed anything here (which they claim they did). At times I can tell the DVDs are superior to the original set, but I think they wanted to go for more of how the cartoon was originally broadcast on TV.

I still give this a 5 star rating because if you have the original set you can use that as a collectible and play this version which is cheaper. If you don't have it at all this is an even better buy for you.

Don't go thinking this is Michael Bay here. There is actually story, characterization and you can follow all the action without getting motion sickness from shaky camerawork. Transformers was always tops for me because the cartoon had a diverse cast of characters, a story with depth and morality. This was still when good was good and evil was evil. This cartoon will entertain you if you aren't into mindless entertainment. If you enjoy mindless entertainment watch Michael Bay's first or 2nd Transformers (or Bayformers as I like to call them because they tarnish the name of Transformers IMO) movie",1246492800,2,1416,4.417624521072797

First off Shout! Factory was formed from Rhino, so the same people are behind this...you can read about it from their website. However they did attempt to fix many of the errors that were present on the original disc.

1. A lot of the ending credits text is actually misalined, though you can't notice unless you compare it to the broadcast versions. The first few eopisodes have the wrong (more then meets the eye) ending credits.

2. The last 4 epoisodes sound effects are turned down much to low. The remix was doing well up until Ultimate Doom 3 and the rest have loud dialog and low sound effects.

 -The Ultimate Doom: Part 3
-Countdown to Extinction
-A Plague of Insecticons
-Heavy Metal War

3. Some scenes they fixed like with Ironhide transformering in reverse were done w/ cheap digital software and look out of place. But it's rather minor issues.

For $20 it's well worth it, just don't expect it to be perfect like I did.",1246320000,22,1133,4.444444444444445
3785994,5,B001SLNPTI,"1984, ""THE TRANSFORMERS"" was a merchandise success as every child wanted to own the latest Transformers toys from Hasbro and act out their own personal battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons and own their favorite robots that came from the popular television and comic book series (despite the TV show and comics having different storylines).

The first season which was written and recorded in the US featured animation by Japan's Toei Animation, aired on television in the US between September through December 1984.  The series is based on the popular Japanese toys from Takara and various other toy companies (ie. Shockwave came from ToyCo., the Insecticons and Skyfire came from Takatoku Toys, etc.) and developed into a line called ""Transformers"" by Hasbro in the United States.  The TV series which featured the first season characters (known as Generation 1 or ""G1') would spawn about 98 episodes in a total of five seasons.

The first season was originally released on DVD back in 2002 from Rhino but was criticized for its high price but most importantly for its problems.  Rhino used the original 35mm film masters which gave the series a much more vibrant look but the problem was that the masters did not include the corrections that were shown on the final cut that aired on television and thus the episodes had incomplete animation.  Picture quality also had problems with ""jaggies"" and featured new sound effects that fans of the original series were not entirely very happy with.

This time around, for the 25th Anniversary release of the first season on DVD, SHOUT FACTORY was not determined to make the same mistake.  In the special note segment of ""THE TRANSFORMERS - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" booklet, the following was mentioned:

Transformers DVDs released prior to our 25th Anniversary Edition were missing animation seen in the original broadcast.  We did extensive research, found the discrepancies between the original broadcast masters and the restored masters used for the last DVD release, reinserted the correct animation and color corrected it as best as we could to match the shots before and after.  But because a one-inch mater tape simply can't hold up to the quality of the restored masters, you may notice occasional shots - or even scenes - in some episodes that seem slightly softer than others.  Just take comfort in knowing that laser blasts have been reinserted, backgrounds have been corrected and Starscream is Starscream once again.

So, I was absolute happy to see a re-release of the first season on DVD.

Of course, back then, as a child who collected the ""Transformers"" toys, the series was just the ultimate cartoon that pitted two robot groups against each other, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons.

The series is about the two factions who have been at war for a long time in their planet of Cybertron.  Two groups would eventually crash land on the Planet Earth and the evil Decepticons attempts to take energy from the planet and being a constant threat to humanity, while the Autobots do what it can to help protect the humans and stop the Decepticons.  The sixteen episodes are featured on two DVD's, while the third disc contains the special features.

""THE TRANSFORMERS - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" comes with the three-part ""More than Meets the Eye"" mini-series and the 13 episodes of Season 1.  Here is a spoiler-less, brief summary of each episode:

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""THE TRANSFORMERS - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" looks very good on DVD.  I've seen a lot of 90's animation make it on DVD and many suffer from a softness that really brings out its age.  Granted, you can tell the picture quality is of an 80's animation but it doesn't look soft.  The animation does have a good number of dust particles throughout the video but it's not very distracting (although, I hope if the series does get a High-Definition transfer, if it is possible, I do hope they do clean the video up of the dust particles).  But otherwise, for an 80's animation to look this good and better than many 90's animation on DVD, is a major plus.

As for audio, audio is presented in Stereo.  Dialogue is clean and easy to understand.  For those with a home theater setup, I found it more pleasing to have my receiver set to output at stereo on all channels.

Overall, each episode is restored to the original broadcast versions with a new stereo soundtrack created from the original audio.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""THE TRANSFORMERS - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" comes with the following special features (note: some were featured on the ""Transformers: The Movie"" 20th Anniversary DVD):

  * TRIPLE CHANGER: From Toy to Comic to Screen - (19:53) Interviews with the people involved with the series, involved with the toys and how the US created a backstory for the toys.  Where the name ""Transformers"", ""Autobots"" and ""Decepticons"" came from.  How character names were made, how Hasbro started working with Takara in terms of the design of the toys and more.  Also, thoughts of those individuals on their favorite characters and toys.
  * ORIGINAL COMMERCIALS - (1:31) Three toy commercials are featured:  Optimus Prime and Megatron, Insecticons and Dinobots and G2 Optimus Prime.
  * PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT - (:31) A PSA for ""Bumblebee: Running Away from Home"".
  * Printable ""Transport to Oblivion"" Script - The script is a 62-page PDF that can be viewed by inserting the DVD to a computer and accessing the file.
  * Booklet - An episode guide booklet plus production credits.
  * Autobot Magnet - Also, included in the box set is a 4-inch tall Autobot magnet.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Growing up with ""The Transformers"", my brother and I were like most kids in the 80's who were literally in love with the toys, the cartoon and comic books.

But moreso, being impressed with the technology that went into having a robot transforming into a car, an airplane, a gun, a dinosaur and an insect.  It may seem commonplace now but back then, it was an amazing time to have these die-cast metal/plastic robots that transform, using the television series as a basis of what robots we wanted to get (and hoped our parents would buy) and have these all out battles.

The first season of ""THE TRANSFORMERS"" was just an amazing cartoon series at the time and I'm still impressed by it 25-years-later.  Watching it now, especially comparing it to a lot of Transformers animated series that have come out in the last two decades, the series continues to remain quite strong compared to the newer incarnations of Transformer-related series (especially with the toys that had die-cast metal, which were really awesome back then compared to some of the plastic Transformers toys that are sold today).

Personally, there is nothing bad I could say about this release.  SHOUT FACTORY learned from Rhino's mistakes of how to issue the series on DVD for the Transformers 25th Anniversary and how to please fans but also admit the challenges they had in restoring the original broadcast versions with a new stereo soundtrack created from the original audio.  Especially, releasing the first season for such a low price.

I also enjoyed the addition of the ""Triple Changer: From Toy to Comic to Screen - The Origins of the Transformers"" which really gave us a behind-the-scenes look on how the series created and the process of coming up with the names of the characters and more.

Again, there's nothing bad I can say about this release.  If I had to really nitpick, sure I can wish for cleaned up video in the hope that thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed (which I do hope they do if they intend to release the series again via High Definition) and I would love to have more Hasbro toy commercials but overall, I'm quite content with the release as is.

If you are a fan of ""The Transformers"" and like many fans who  have wanted to own the first season on DVD without breaking the bank, now you can own it for a low price with a much superior release compared to the last.  The series has been restored to the original broadcast versions and no more missing animation or any audio problems.  This release is quite solid and is simply the definitive DVD version of ""THE TRANSFORMERS - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" to own.

Highly recommended!",1246060800,22,11346,4.745398773006135
3785995,4,B001SLNPTI,"An exceptional deal for under $20, this DVD contains the first season of the Transformers original series (16 episodes). With a 3rd DVD containing extras and special features, you can't go wrong buying this DVD set...unless you already have this season on a previous DVD release.

Overall, a great deal! Excellent for fans of the original series or for people who want to discover the roots of their favorite robots in disguise.",1245974400,,428,4.944444444444445
3785996,5,B001SLNPTI,"This box set is a must have for anyone that grew up watching the Transformers. The only thing I don't like about it is it's still in the orginal format so there's black bars on the sides of the screen, but it takes nothing away from the cartoon. The show is still as great as it was 25 years ago!",1245888000,3,296,3.95
3785997,3,B001SLNPTI,"Well I bought this DVD collection because I loved the first movie so much, and I'm excited for the upcoming Revenge of the Fallen. This is a nice collection if you grew up watching this. I find myself being very bored by the episodes. Each one usually has the same outcome,(""DECEPTICONS RETREAT!!!!) lol. It is pretty cool to see the cartoon versions of the Autobots and Decepticons have the same personalities they had in the movie though. This would be a good gift for a child or someone who grew up watching the cartoon. I would NOT advise you to buy this if you are in between like me.
The Collection does come with some nice DVD extras. Old transformer toy commercials, PSA, and an AUTOBOT magnet. The picture and sound quality is top notch so in that aspect, its good. But don't buy this collection if your looking for some ACTION! but it is a nice collection for a child or someone who just wants to Relive their Childhood!!",1245542400,5,931,4.482352941176471
3785998,4,B001SLNPTI,"For the last few years it's been a wonderful time for fans of 80s cartoons.  Between the lovely Filmation sets released by the now sadly defunct BCI Eclipse, Warner Bros. stepping up to the plate and offering action cartoons like Thundercats and the Silverhawks, WEP/Anime Works/Media Blasters releasing the complete series of Voltron, Time Life releasing the complete Real Ghostbusters, and Shout! Factory picking up dropped licenses for a ton of DiC and now Sunbow cartoons, releasing 30-odd episode sets instead of the paltry 4 episode discs for shows like C.O.P.S. and Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, it's just been great.

With the recently released Transformers season one 25th anniversary edition, Shout! Factory has stepped up its game and taken on a tent-pole series, looking to correct the mistakes in the show's past DVD releases (both in terms of price point, attractive packaging and actual animation and sound snafus from the 2002 Rhino releases.)  Taking a nod from Time Life and their release of the Real Ghostbusters, Shout! is putting together multiple DVD sets that'll hopefully appease both casual and hardcore fans.  This set is the first of 4 individual releases that will comprise the complete Transformers cartoon.  They're also prepping a all-in-one complete series package set ,the Matrix of Leadership edition set for release on July 13th through their website.

This first set includes all 16 episodes from season one, a 20 minute documentary featurette featuring a lot of the creative team responsible for the original toy line, the Marvel comics series, and the cartoon, a G.I. Joe-style ""Knowing is half the battle..."" PSA featuring Bumblebee, three archival Hasbro toy commercials, a printable script for the episode ""Transport to Oblivion"", and a large b&w Autobot magnet.  For the most part, these episodes are from the same masters that Rhino used in the 2002 releases, but Brian Ward and his team painstakingly researched the discrepancies between the original masters and the broadcast versions, and replaced most of the incorrect footage (and sound) with the correct sections from the 1"" broadcast tapes.  For most casual fans these changes will be transparent, but for longtime viewers, these new DVDs are the closest we've gotten to how the show was originally shown on TV.  Unfortunately, the 1"" tapes segments tend to stick out a bit, and can be a bit jarring as the animation flows between the crisp sequences of the original masters and the softer, slightly duller 1""broadcast tape.  On the whole though, knowing that the original broadcast versions are preserved far outweighs the visual bumpiness.

The episodes included on disc 1:
-More Than Meets the Eye: Part 1
-More Than Meets the Eye: Part 2
-More Than Meets the Eye: Part 3
-Transport to Oblivion
-Roll for It
-Divide and Conquer
-Fire in the Sky
-S.O.S. Dinobots

The episodes included on disc 2:
-Fire on the Mountain
-War of the Dinobots
-The Ultimate Doom: Part 1
-The Ultimate Doom: Part 2
-The Ultimate Doom: Part 3
-Countdown to Extinction
-A Plague of Insecticons
-Heavy Metal War

As far as the packaging, presentation and bonus materials go, I was very impressed by the attention to detail and that Shout! had and eye on the style of the original toy packaging when designing the slipcase, sleeve inserts, disc art and the episode guide.  The foil embossed slipcase is brilliant and just plain beautiful (especially compared to the rather dull silver digipaks of the original 2002 Rhino release.)  This is the best work I've seen from Shout! when it comes to their 80s cartoon releases.  The menu navigation is light years better than the old Rhino DVDs as well, with an included feature to play multi-part episodes together without interrupting the flow of the cartoon by cutting out the opening and closing credits on the in-between episodes.  The 20 minute ""From Toy to Comic to Screen"" featurette takes its cue from the docs that Andy Mangels did for the BCI Eclipse He-Man, She-Ra, and Dungeons and Dragons sets, and is well produced.  The main focus of the doc centers around Hasbro acquiring the toy license from Takara, the development of the Marvel comic series, and eventually how the storylines for the three platforms differed, and features creative talent that worked for Marvel, Hasbro and Sunbow past and present.  It's not quite as in-depth as I was hoping, skirting talk of the production of the series for the most part, but according to the specs of the Complete series set, we can expect two more docs in these individual sets, as well as two additional and exclusive docs on the complete set (including a voice actor reunion), so there's room for more down the road.  As for the toy commercials, two of them pertain to G1 toys, while a third is for the G2 Optimus Prime re-release.  It's really interesting seeing these, though it can be distracting while watching them because the child actor's faces were blurred.

All in all, for a set retailing between $20-30, fans couldn't really ask for anything better.  This is the first time the Transformers series has been released with this much loving detail at such an affordable price in the US, and hopefully it's just the icing on the cake as there are three more sets, a complete series set, 4 individual G.I. Joe sets (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/G-I-Joe-A-Real-American-Hero-Season-1-1/dp/B001U9BS38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">G.I.

3785999,4,B001SLNPTI,"I remember watching these as a kid after school and it's everything I remembered it to be. Now I can watch it with my boys and relive the fun all again. Quality of picture and sound are great and you've gotta love that old-school transforming sound!

The only complaint I have is that they actually put in the transition to commercial screens ""Transformers will return in a moment"" and ""And now back to Transformers"". I was expecting maybe some old Transformer toy commercials which would have at least been nostalgic, but this is just wasted time, in my opinion.",1245283200,2,563,4.686868686868687
3786000,5,B001SLNPTI,"I was a small boy when the Transformers came out and I remember rushing home to watch the show. I recorded a few episodes on beta tapes when I was a kid. These DVDs are great because digital video technology was unimaginable when these shows came out. The first time the series was released on DVD it was pretty expensive and the discs came in an awkward case. The new release is housed in two slim plastic cases: one for both of the episode discs, and one for the special features.

I still love the Transformers cartoon, even if only for the nostalgic value. Hearing the old sound effects and voices is really cool. It really brought me back to see some of the visual effects too, like the way the energon cubes would glow. I probably wouldn't be into it if I hadn't watched it as a kid. Today's animation is much better, but this is classic.",1245196800,,844,4.341772151898734
3786001,5,B001SLNPTI,"For anyone who grew up watching The Transformers, these DVDs will be a wonderful trip down memory lane. The episodes all look great with the correct animation color inserted back in which was missing from the previous edition. The recaps of previous episodes and previews for upcoming ones are included, as well as bumper spots for commercial breaks that will instantly take you back to when you first saw them. The sound is quite good and a definite improvement from the previous edition.

""Triple Changer: From Toy to Comic to Screen"" is a 20-minute retrospective featurette about The Transformers phenomenon. The show's origins came from several Japanese toy lines. An American company named Hasbro decided to bring it to North America and create a cartoon around them, giving each robot its own personality and create a storyline. They also created a comic book to go with the toys. With this featurette we get the lowdown behind the names for the various robots in this informative and engaging extra.

Also included are three original commercials, vintage ads that tie in the toys with cartoons. The one featuring the Insecticons is a particularly memorable one.

""Public Service Announcement"" is an example of how each episode used to end with a Transformer imparting a safety lesson and this one sees Bumblebee convincing a kid not to run away from home. This is all good cheesy fun.

3786005,4,B001SLNPTI,"Ah, the 80s.  The era of the best cartoons ever made.  GI Joe, Robotech, Thundercats, and, last but definitely not least, The Transformers.  I grew up on the G1 Transformers.  It was and still is my most favorite cartoon of all time.  When Rhino released the series on DVD I was excited.  I ran out to Best Buy and bought the First Season Box Set on DVD.  My best friend (a huge fan as well) and I watched the first disc and had our first Transformers fix since the early 90s (the lat time it was ever aired on TV in our area and had been poorly edited with those stupid cube transitions to make it ""more appealing to a new generation"").

After watching the whole First Season of the Rhino release, I was extremely disappointed.  I have a great memory of these classics.  As I was watching the episodes they were replaying in my mind exactly as they had played as when I was a child.  Except there were issues.  My mind was waving a HUGE RED FLAG.  Things were missing, voices were on the wrong characters, colors were wrong (Starscream colored like Thundercracker or Skywarp or vice versa), and bad editing.  On top of it, Season 2 and 3 had episodes way out of order, especially Season 3.  The first return of Optimus Prime was supposed to be toward the end of the season, not the beginning (somewhere like 2 or 3 episodes from the season finale).  Also, the supposed 5.1 surround sound was poorly done.  I had to change my stereo to the 2.1 setting to hear everything correctly.

I read that this is actually cut from the actual broadcast versions, so here is to hoping.  I never was able to find Season 2 at all because Sony bought out the franchise by the time I had enough money to finish the collection so all I could find was Season 3 and 4.  I really hope to get this whole collection this time if they are going to be correctly done and I will box away my old collection or sell it off.  I should also get the 20th anniversary of the movie since the original DVD release was also not done well (4:3 screen and no surround).",1241568000,3,2033,4.283464566929134
3786006,5,B001SLNPTI,"The Transformers series began 25 years ago in 1984. As I recall, several months before the first season of Generation One appeared on TV screens, the Transformers originally appeared in an animated commercial ad for their comic-book mini-series by Marvel Comics as the G1 toys hit store shelves and the madness for the Transformers took off as did the popularity of G.I. Joe. Now both animated series are getting re-released on DVD in convenience to their live-action movies hitting theaters soon. It would be great to include the Transformers and G.I. Joe on Blu-Ray as did the ""20th Anniversary of Transformers the Movie"" got limited release from England. But the Blu-Ray format did not include the special features from the DVD version (which I still have).

And to be fair, Jem should also be re-released on DVD and Blu-Ray for series' female audience since today's kids are into Hannah Montana. Jem's limited DVD release some years back was robbery to a percentage of die-hard fans that missed it. Who knows, Hollywood might do a live-action Jem movie.",1241568000,2,1057,4.971751412429379
3786007,5,B001SLNPTI,"As one other reviewer stated it looks like Shout will be putting out a complete G1 transformers series later this summer so as a long time fan of the series from the start I'm going to wait for that version rather than one season at a time besides who knows how long it may be inbetween season releases ?
I already own the Rhino version from several years ago and I got a PS3 a little less than a year ago and I put in the first season Rhino version disc just the other day and the blu ray features of the PS3 really enhanced the picture and sound, looks GREAT on my 61"" high def tv and next will be to watch the whole series. Some may ask if I already own the series on dvd and it looks great enhanced in the blu ray player why bother getting this release well it's because I'm a huge fan of the transformer franchise and these are the original broadcast versions so it will be interesting to see what differences there may be, the Rhino dvd's were essentially ""spliced"" together from various sources such as 35mm film negatives and one or two other sources as the footage was badly damaged from years of storage and neglect.
I give the series itself a five star rating here but suggest that to those who really want to collect the entire series then wait for the full SERIES release from Shout sometime later this summer rather than just the first season.",1240790400,4,1357,4.284046692607004

Original Concept Artwork
Archival Hasbro Toy Commercials
Rare Public Service Announcements
""Triplechanger: From Toy To Comic To Screen: The Origins Of The Transformers"" Featurette
A Printable Script For The Episode ""Transport To Oblivion""
& A Limited Edition Autobot Magnet

The animation may not have been the best on this series but in the eighties it's all we needed and our active imaginations filled in the rest. Despite the older less impressive animation these episodes are still classics to those who remember them and will be more enjoyable for most of us than the many spinoffs that followed the G1 series. There was something innocent about the series here, maybe because it was so early before the fact that each episode was really just a half hour commercial became common knowledge, maybe because here they actually looked like robots in disguise, but maybe just because they are the ones most of us grew up on and where the whole lasting franchise found it's niche.

Fans should be very excited to own these episodes in a new more affordable set. The set is being put out by Shout! Factory and they have always done an excellent job of providing fans with a lot of well done special features on long awaited sets. This set was originally announced as having a few special features included with more possibly in the works but I'm very glad to see the amount that they have now announced for it and have updated this review to include them. Alot of people who didn't buy the more expensive original sets are going to be excited at the chance to get this one and I know that I can't wait. I originally gave this set 5 stars just for the opportunity to own these classic episodes in a proper DVD set, but after hearing that they will in fact be restored to original broadcast versions with a new stereo soundtrack created from the original audio I'm more excited than ever.

Some may say that this series was just the next step in a great advertising campaign for children's toys but those of us who grew up being entertained by it know that there truly is more to this series than meets the eye. Thanks For Your Time.

*Rather than clutter up the review page I have posted a list of episode descriptions in my comments section for those who are curious.
