8380175,1,B002TJ68II,This program needs to have a disclaimer put on it before purchase.  Only covers UK birthing policies.  No applicable in the United States.  Wish I could ask for my money back!,1363910400,,175,4.580645161290323
8380176,3,B002TJ68II,"The video does provide an overview of the three trimesters including a live birth, with interviews with the moms.  It's a little outdated and produced from a UK perspective, but then it's always fun to hear the British accents and vocabulary.",1353715200,,242,4.902439024390244
8380177,1,B002TJ68II,"I think we got more out of ""what to expect when you're expecting"" (a user rated one star movie also) than this video. They should mention that it takes place in the UK--we have nothing in common with that culture here in CA except the fact that they are humans having babies. Not informative enough for newly pregnant couples.",1349222400,,326,4.5423728813559325
8380178,5,B002TJ68II,"A very educational documentary on three pregnant women. Great for someone who plans to or is already baring a child. I'm not pregnant, but this film has gotten me well-prepared for the day to come! This would be a great gift as a DVD for a baby shower or for a friend whose due date is soon!",1310515200,,291,4.12280701754386
8380179,3,B002TJ68II,"This UK DVD is follows three women through their pregnancies - each in a different trimester and also follows one woman through labour and birth. Although most women will be able to relate to these experiences, health care practices and labour laws are different in the UK than in the US and Canada. There are many useful tips like what to bring to the hospital, and suggestions on things to buy for baby.  Although, nappies, is a far cuter term than diapers, this and other UK terminology for baby items may confuse some parents.
I also found the summary of symptoms at the end of each chapter focused too much on potential negative symptoms and the footage of the birth itself, although very realistic, was not the most re-assuring for women hoping to avoid having an epidural.  It would be nice to show examples of natural births without medical pain relief as well.",1307491200,2,869,4.673202614379085
