as she gets a deal with sire, then as her videos started to come out, as she also have children books, music DVDs, as well as live performances, the people in this documentary talks about Madonna, from the beginning as a dancer, to the star she is today",1422057600,,340,4.328125
8515400,1,B007EQQJXA,Do not buy this. It is not a horrible one but the quality is awful. It changes from woman's narrative to couple of people talking about Madonna and sound goes from loud to quite. Terrible quality. Painful. Bad editing. But the sound thing is what turned me off from the beginning. It goes on for 39 minutes.,1384128000,,307,4.4035087719298245
8515401,1,B007EQQJXA,I rarely write bad reviews. But this DVD is a waist of money. i am glad I watched it right away so I can return it before the return period expires. First: listed as 70 min - reality: 40 min. Sound volume of narrator and people who were interviewed is different. Always goes up and down. Annoying. Basically it is bunch of people saying what they think of Madonna. And narrator just reads her biography while they show some footage of Madonna on a background. Big NO. Very low quality DVD. I could make one like that with MAC DVD maker myself.  Do not waist your money.,1363132800,,569,4.317757009345795
