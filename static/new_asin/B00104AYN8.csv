I tried 3 different DVD players including a region free player and a brand new one.  The dvd skipped, stalled and froze completely making it impossible to watch the episodes.  Not sure what process the manufacturer used but it obviously didn't work.  I even tried to play it on my computer DVD drive and the disk ejected immediately and would not read",1521936000,,466,4.5

8236763,5,B00104AYN8,"Certainly one of the best quality and most honest series, with good scripts, fine guest stars and a realism assent from nearly everything filmed since. by comparison. The three leads are adequate and play very well together; some of the sets are lavish, others bare bones. But for overall script quality and values, this is one of the most memorable series ever made. It's about a hero without silly flaws; and because it's done in regard to an earlier era, when men move they have to walk, run, paddle a canoe, ride a horse,  etc;  It's the producers' sand directors' ability to make a virtue out of a wartime/emergency situation and the purposes of dialogue, individual courage, judgment, etc. set this apart from mean streets' rock music triviality and betrayal of admirability in humans. I can recommend the series, as a writer and critic, as one of the best of all half hour dramas ever done. All of the plots work, for me.",1409011200,5,928,4.6871165644171775
8236764,2,B00104AYN8,I did not think the quality of this DVD very good and it has deterred me from purchasing any further of this program. Cheers Judy,1349568000,3,129,4.2
