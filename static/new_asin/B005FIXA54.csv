4680153,3,B005FIXA54,"After watching Evil Bong 3: The Wrath Of Bong, I have come to the realization that the Evil Bong series is one that if you like one you'll like them all, and if you dislike one you will dislike them all. What I'm getting at is that my opinion for each of the Evil Bong movies is exactly the same. All of them are inconsistently funny, but have enough laughs to warrant a recommendation if you like ""late night comedies"", as netflix labels them. Evil Bong 3 is about an alien bong that transports anyone who smokes from it to another planet. And you guessed it. All of our stupid heroes smoke from it. There is some alien nudity in this one, as well a few Avatar jokes. Just like the first Evil Bongs, the actor who played Gramps is my favorite thing about it. He is hilarious and has lots of colorful insults. Bottom line: If you like Evil Bong and Evil Bong 2, you should see this one. If you didn't, this one won't win you over. It's more of the same.",1315353600,5,953,4.184782608695652

8470122,2,B005FIXA54,"Brett, Bachman, and the gang are back for another far-out adventure in EVIL BONG 3! When an alien bong comes crashing to Earth, it will take the world's strongest-- wait... bravest-- wait... HIGHEST heroes to stop it! Anyone who smokes from the bong is instantly transported to the creature's homeworld, where hot alien babes work to harvest their seed in order to form an intergalactic army to invade Earth! Hot chicks stealing sperm after you get stoned? This kind of sounds like it should have been called ""THE MOST AWESOME BONG EVER"" instead! What more could your average pothead ask for than a film that features tons of weed, tons of nudity, and two trippy talking bongs... IN 3-D and Sniff-O-Rama?! Well, it will definitely take a couple of bongloads to get through this boring mess, and the amount you've smoked will determine whether this is the best or the worst movie you have ever seen. Full Moon has always been known for coming up with creative stories and entertaining effects on no money at all, but the low-budget in EVIL BONG 3 is more apparent than ever. Poorly dressed sets, a recycled plot, and lackluster special effects... This is a long ways off from 90's classics like SUBSPECIES or the PUPPET MASTER series. At least August White's script stays consistent with the two earlier entries, providing the same enjoyable characters and inane humor for a few stupid laughs. Pack that bong tight and grab your 3-D glasses if you hope to blast off with EVIL BONG 3!
