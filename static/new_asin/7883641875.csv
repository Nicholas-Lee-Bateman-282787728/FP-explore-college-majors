Wikpedia also describes the fulm very well.
Is it an Ealing Comedy? Does it matter?
The story, based on a short story of Mark Twain, is simple.
An American sailor, played by Gregory Peck, arrives in London with no money or job.
By luck he meets two eccentric old men who offer him a deal: they will give him money in an envelope, and IF he is able to return the money to them in a month, they will give him a good job.
The twist is that the money is a one-million pound bank note.
(The film explains that, for dealings between banks, TWO actual million-pound notes have indeed been printed, and this is one of them.)
The catch is that such a huge sum of money is impossible for any shop or bank to cash.
The humour is that all the shops and banks bend over backwards to offer unlimited credit to a man who appears to be an eccentric millionaire.
The rest is very funny, brilliantly scripted, superbly acted, with an outstanding cast, and an ending that is perfect!

1148179,1,7883641875,"I have always loved this movie, a story based on a Mark Twain writing. I saw it last on TV years ago and wanted to get a copy for myself and for the college film class I teach. The DVD sucks! The color is off just enough to to be irritating and the initial recording is in Chinese! While you can change the language, the dubbing is off....lips moving, no words or words and people just standing there. Unless you want to waste several dollars, I would not buy this knock off copy. I did find a very scarce VHS copy which restored my sanity. I should say the purchase of the ""Chinese version"" wasn't all bad, my students got a good laugh and a lesson in purchasing DVDs.",1277164800,,669,4.1937984496124034
1148180,4,7883641875,"I have this movie on VHS tape, but wish it would be put in a U.S DVD format.  THis movie was made in 1954 and is based on a short story by Mark Twain.  Gregory Peck plays a penniless American sailor lucky enough to be passing the house of two rich British men. They offer the sailor a loan in the form of a single banknote in the amount of one MILLION POUNDS. The sailor finds that whenever he tries to spend it, no one is able to make change, therefore they let him have whatever he desires on account, assuming that he is a very wealthy man. Ultimately, the money turns out to be more of a curse than a blessing.  It has a good ending.
  As I said, I wish this movie would be put on DVD for Region 1.  It seems like foreign countries are luckier than the United States in having these great, old movies put on DVD.  Wish our movie distributors would get on the ball and let us see these wonderful movies, too!",1226361600,5,911,4.055865921787709
1148181,5,7883641875,"This Black and White film, released in 1954 in Britain as ""The Million Pound Note"" and in the USA as ""Man with a Million"", is an interesting and entertaining comedy.

It is based on a classic Mark Twain story: focusing on how a man's true worth is not determined by externals (in this case, the Million Pound note that Peck's character carries, but cannot spend, as he agreed with the two English capitalists who rescued him from the street).

Many of the scenes, such as Peck's Character walking into a men's clothiers shop in rags, and then seeing the clerk's reaction to him before (and after) learning that he carried such a note, are really hilarious - and do a good job of illustrating how much all of us value others based on externals.

Gregory Peck was very conscious of social issues and active in campaigning against social ills and wrongs.  This film is one of the earliest examples of his expressing his strong feelings in this area through his art.

Although the film satirizes British ideas about class and ""good breeding"", the underlying lesson really applies to us all, regardless of our country of origin.  Highly recommended!

NB: VHS copies of this film can be found, with some digging, through classic video sites located in the US and Canada.  DVD copies can also be found, but those I've located are not viewable on North American DVD Players.",1167350400,9,1366,4.7100840336134455

Hot Toasty Rag, August 8, 2017

Imagine a cross between Brewsters Millions and Trading Places, and youll get Gregory Pecks Man with a Million. Wilfrid Hyde-White and Ronald Squire, are rich and idle brothers looking for a little fun. They come up with a bet: give a total stranger a million pound note, and tell him that if he lasts a month without spending it, theyll give him a good job. One man thinks its the knowledge of having untouchable wealth that will propel the pauper into the high life, and the other thinks hell have to spend it to get ahead. Greg plays the Man with a Million, or in other countries release, the man with The Million Pound Note.
If you like those types of movies, youll like this one, since it doesnt stray very far from the usual mold. Theres a moral debate, lots of jokes, lots of satire about the upper classit stems from a Mark Twain storyand a fair amount of silliness. Plus, its a period piece and Greg looks very handsome in his beautiful clothes, so youll have plenty of eye candy. If you're looking for a more serious Gregory Peck movie, youve got tons to choose from, but its nice to see him step out from his Atticus Finch person and have some silly fun every once in a while.",1502150400,,1251,4.369098712446352

7900720,3,7883641875,"Lighthearted film about a shipwrecked American mariner stuck in England with no money, no identify, or the means to go home.

Gregory Peck plays Henry Adams, stranded in the British Isles with nothing to his name after being swept up in a storm off the New England coast - when it was over he found himself in Old England. Hungry and homeless - desperation beginning to set in. He doesn't want a handout, just an honest chance to pull himself up by his own bootstraps. But dressed as a vagabond and not having showered for a while limits his options by a far margin.

Floundering and starving, he's about to pick up a piece of half-eaten fruit from the street when he's spotted by a pair of eccentrics. Chosen at random by two wealthy brothers who have set out to drastically alter one person's life. Choices and decisions - both good and bad - and the ultimate consequences of such decisions are what the brothers are attempting to resolve.

The point of contention: Does money equate to happiness?

For an empty belly - the easy answer is 'yes'.

Toward that end - the brothers have devised a test of sorts. A wholly unique 1 Million Pound Note is crafted by Her Majesty's mint as a personal service to the quirky and extraordinarily wealthy siblings.

A temporary gift.

30 days.

Thirty days at the end of which, if the recipient is able to return the note unspent, their dream will be fulfilled. In Hank's case: A good paying job so that he can earn a ticket back to America.

But as he quickly settles into an existence of ease and luxury, life choices become grayer and less distinct - especially with the introduction of Ms. Portia Landsdowne, played by beautiful Jane Griffiths.

It's no surprise that he's fallen for a local aristo. But he's laid the foundation of their relationship on an unintentional falsehood - that of an American millionaire. And her standard for conduct by any potential suitor is honor. She's even willing to step down in station, but not if their love is built upon a lie.

Desperate to reveal the truth without compromising the agreement he has with the Montpelier Brothers, costing everything promised to him, Henry must make a decision.

Which path leads to true happiness?

Overall, a serviceable comedy. As I'm also a big fan of Gregory Peck, it hurts to put this down as a three-star production. But I don't think an actor of his talent or prestige would've appreciated false praise.
