243017,4,6300213056,"I've bought this video from Amazon, and I can tell you it's great! It's  the un-aired, pilot episode of ""Star Trek: The Original Series"",  with an introduction and conclusion by creator Gene Roddemberry. This  episode was the one that was created to show how the product was, but it  seems that the company didn't liked it (don't be surprised, Superman was  rejected at the beginning too) and the episode was never aired on TV.  During the episode, it switches from Black and White to Color and  vice-versa several times, and so we can contrast how the episode was  originally from Gene Roddemberry and a more appropriate version of the  episode.  The plot: The Enterprise has found some survivors of a  previous crash of another starship, and comes to the rescue. But it was  just an illusion created by some ultra-intelligent aliens who wanted to  make tests on the captain, and some others things I won't tell you so I  don't spoil the fun...  Just don't think that this episode can be dull  just for being old, it's a great episode. However, they could have switched  from B&W to Colors less times and make the ending a little better, but  anyway, it's a great episode. If you're a Star Trek fan, you just can't  miss this one...

243059,5,6300213056,"Greetings,

Well, just finished watching this first episode (pilot) for the first time. I must say that it does meet Star Trek standards. It does, however, reflect the specific mentality of the time period it was filmed in. References to women not belonging on the deck, and that women who are on the deck just aren't women, along with many others as you will see. The story, although a very creative one, does delve into the darker emotions of the human race. References to sexual desires, and fantasies may have been for that time too avant-garde for the network producers. The final message from this work of art comes through as having two equally good choices in life. One being living a life with all its imperfections, the other being living is a life of fantasy, drugs (as described in the movie as the ability to create illusions through thought/memory/desire manipulation), and enslaving races that can be enslaved. Although all this was packaged as a desire for survival, the final words of the alien race did clearly present these two options. Morality?

For its time, this was a very bold offer to the public and can easily be understood why a second pilot was requested. This is a great piece of historical footage and showcases many period specific mentalities, a great item to have on a shelf.

Best Regards,

Perhaps in the quarter-century since, that entire show, which NBC execs REJECTED, has been reconstructed in full color (not sure on that).

Roddenberry's 1964 sales pitch of ""Wagon Train to the Stars"" fell like an anvil on buyers who expected all mindless action and were instead given a fairly cerebral, philosophical initial offering. Fortunately for us, despite NBc's dissatisfaction a second pilot was ordered, but with certain cast changes. Majel Barrett (Mrs. Roddenberry) was sacked as first officer (""Number One""), and replaced by Science Officer Spock (whom Roddenberry refused to part with). Barrett would resurface once the series was safely established, as Nurse Chapel.

Yeoman Rand (the troubled Grace Lee Whitney) took over for Yeoman Colt (Laurel Goodwin). Dr. Boyce (John Hoyt) was relieved by a younger 'Bones' McCoy (DeForrest Kelly) and of course, Capt.

Engineer Scott and Ensign Chekov were not yet in this retooled show.

Those familiar with ""The Menagerie"" will note that the Tallosians had more male-sounding voices in the Hunter pilot. With intercutting between b&w and color footage the main alien's voice keeps changing pitch. Also here is something that always confused me in ""The Menagerie.""

In the two-parter, it's revealed to Capt. Pike that the lone crash survivor, Vina is in reality terribly disfigured, which is why she freely chooses to stay with the Tallosians. Pike asks that her beauty be restored, then comes the baffling answer ""She will be given that... and more."" We never see what the ""more"" is. In ""Menagerie,"" quadriplegic Pike is beamed to the surface where, now physically whole, he's reunited with the lovely Vina; they supposedly live happily ever after with the Tallosians. In the original pilot however, ""...and more"" means the aliens create for Vina an illusory Pike and the real captain returns to his ship.

243065,5,6300213056,"It's not often you get to own television history of what was to become a Star Trek phenom. Reading the back of the box ""Airdate:Never shown on TV!"" in red ink is something! Many people make comparisons between Pike and Kirk. Everyone says it's the acting of William Shatner vs. Jeffrey Hunter with Hunter's Pike seeming to think too much vs. Shatner's Kirk being more energetic. Shatner replaced Hunter so Kirk was written to be more energetic, have more fight scenes, being the womanizing captain in nearly every episode. Personally I think Jeffrey Hunter was cuter than Shatner was. There are two things prophetic about the Cage. Telosian illusion is comparable to Holodecks in Star Trek The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine which is interesting because no one could've predicted Star Trek would sell later until it did, and the scene where Captian Pike is forced to relive a battle and getting knocked down by that really tall warrior in bad need of an Orthodontist going after Vina, Jeff Hunter passed away because of a fall five years later. This tape is from someone's collection and I'm amazed how well it was taken care of with only it's bottom edges slightly worn. Sure could use some lessons from them on proper tape cover care even with a case. The late Gene Roddenberry does a little background information in the beginning to explain some things. He seemed so nice. What I've always found amusing about The Cage when I've seen it in the Menagerie is near the end when the Keeper's voice suddenly lowers and slows. Or...is it just a Telosian illusion.",1183939200,,1566,4.761029411764706
243066,4,6300213056,"Those who are expecting the usual Kirk, Spock, and McCoy will be strangely surprised by this pilot episode for classic Star Trek.
Featuring Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Pike, this episode really began what was to become the phenomenon of Star Trek.  Gene Roddenberry asked the networks if they wanted a ""Wagon Train to the Stars"".  When he got the go-ahead from NBC, he made this episode to show execs what he had to offer.  It's almost a wonder that a second pilot ever got made.  Gene was not afraid of taking chances - he had a woman as second in command (""Number One"") and a multi-ethnic crew far before the term ""politically correct"" ever was even heard of.  NBC execs wanted Gene to get rid of the female second in command and ""do something about those ears"", and Gene responded with the second pilot, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"".  Star Trek, to my knowledge, is the only show that has ever been granted a second chance like that.
This episode is worth watching.  Gene filmed both an introduction to the episode and an epilogue after the episode that really add to your understanding of what makes this episode stand out.  Some people say Jeffrey Hunter was kind of wooden, but I enjoyed his sense of wonder, as was evidenced by the very short scene on the planet where he discovers the ""singing plants"".  Spock is completely out of what was to become his character - he even shouts ""The Women!"" when the Talosians only allow the two females from the Enterprise to beam down to Pike's location.  And Dr Piper has a few things in common with McCoy - he even deals out the occasional medical martini.  Some of these characters will undergo further development later.
But it's the story that stands out.  Although by SF standards, the ""Adam and Eve"" plot is trite and overused, the fresher spin on it provided by the Talosians with their great mental powers allow it to not be as stale.  Their ability to make people believe their fantasies are real really make the show.  Anyone who isn't a little turned on by the Green Orion Slave girl dance is brain dead.  And there's even some back story to characters we will never see again with Pike's horse and his memories of another battle on another world.
This episode will eventually be cut up and reused in the only classic Trek two-parter, ""Menagerie"", but I'd recommend this VHS and DVD not only to classic Trek lovers (who will =have= to have it to complete their collections) but to general SF fans - it's fun to see where a classic show actually begins.",1032652800,10,2510,4.55902004454343
243067,5,6300213056,"I am not a Trekkie by any stretch of the imagination, but I've always loved 'The Cage'. The story is one of the most interesting of all the episodes. For an early 1960's film on it's own, it borders on amazing. The whole episode is how should we say....dreamy. The entire cast seams to float along as if in a sleepy daze. It makes me wonder if the cast and director were all on some weird 60's drugs.
Sur-realism, memories, and mind control are the name of the game here, and the big headed aliens can make your life heaven or hell, depending on how you behave. I thought Captain Pike was great, much better than Pricard, but not quite as good as Kirk. Maybe he could have fit into the series somewhere, but I think he leaves a great legacy as a one-time captain.
Everyone thinks the 'big' scene is Mr. Spock smiling and grinning stupidly at some vibrating cardboard flowers, but they are wrong.
Susan Oliver as Vina, oh how beatiful she is. I have always been infatuated with green skinned slave girls anyway. I've made several bids for them, but always fall short cash wise (maybe a dylithium mine would help). Wathing Susan dance half-naked in her green body paint is much too seductive for 1960s and is possibly why the series was not picked up. I can see the producers now thinking ""What the hell bloody show are you perverts trying to make? This is 1964 for crying out loud! Slave women who dance for their owners? Barbarians!""
Well I sit and watch Sweet Vina dance and dance and dance. I never get tired of her. If I was Pike I would have told Spock to fly off without me. I would have made sure the aliens kept her as the 'Green Illusion' and supplied them with a whole herd of slaves to do their manual labor. Sure when you saw her in her real state she was pretty messed up, but no worse than my ex-wife when she woke up with a hangover Sunday morning.",1019606400,4,1862,4.322857142857143

243099,3,6300213056,"Until 1964, ""TV science fiction"" meant kiddie fare--Captain Video, ray guns and bug-eyed monsters. Then along came Gene Roddenberry and his ""'Wagon Train' to the stars"", a quirky little series proposal called STAR TREK.

Not the ""Star Trek"" you know, mind you. This ""pilot"" episode (a test film designed to sell a series) may take place on a recognizable starship ""Enterprise"" and feature an embryonic version of Spock, but there the similarity ends. Captain Christopher Pike (played stiffly by Jeffrey Hunter) heeds an eighteen-year-old distress call coming from the planet Talos IV, where he finds a crude camp of aging, ragged survivors--and one beautiful young woman. He discovers too late that it is all a ruse, an illusion generated by the large-skulled Talosians. Pike finds himself a prisoner in a sort of interplanetary zoo, where the Talosians intend to breed him with the lovely young woman, Vina. While trying desperately to escape, he discovers the sad truth about the Talosian race--and Vina herself.

This first effort failed to sell the series, of course, and in retrospect it's not hard to see why. Leonard Nimoy had not yet found his character--he shouts his lines and on at least one occasion (heaven forbid) smiles. Jeffrey Hunter appears to sleepwalk through his part at times, while overemoting in others. However, John Hoyt, as the original chief medical officer Phillip Boyce, foreshadows many of the later character traits of Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy. Roddenberry, in the introduction, tries to tell us that Majel Barrett as ""Number One"" did not go over well because people were unused to seeing a female in a position of responsibility, but it is more likely they just did not like Barrett herself. She comes across as wooden and lacking in personality.

Still, ""The Cage"" shows great promise--the story itself is on a par with many of the later series episodes, and is in fact superior to some. The effects, though crude by today's standards, were astounding for 1964 (the pilot cost close to an unheard-of $500,000, and it shows). It was good enough to impress NBC executives--although they rejected the proposed story as ""too cerebral"", they encouraged Roddenberry to try again, with a different cast and more action. The result was the successful second pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before""--and a legend was born.

The viewer may be annoyed by the constant shifts from black and white to color (the missing color footage was found and restored years after this video went on the market--the rest was used in ""The Menagerie"") but it's worth the trouble to see how the most successful franchise in television history began.

Oddly enough, the idea that a network would order a second pilot for a failed series proposal is not as unusual as you may believe. The same year ""The Cage"" was filmed, rival CBS ordered yet another failed pilot remade with a mostly-new cast. Maybe you've heard of it--""Gilligan's Island."" Oh well, you win some, you lose some...",994896000,6,2980,5.0
243100,5,6300213056,"This first episode of Star Trek (which didn't air) was the best.

Hunter was good in THE SEARCHERS, better than you'd think as Jesus Christ in KING OF KINGS, but he's at his best as the Captain of the Enterprise!  Even though the story is an obvious ripoff of FORBIDDEN PLANET, Hunter combines his All American good looks with a take charge attitude as he establishes himself as the ultimate STAR TREK man of action, as he barks orders, fires ray guns, battles space monsters, and is ultimately given a choice to mate with one of 3 different women by the intellectually advanced beings of Talos 4.
  Unfortunately, after the filming of ""The Cage,"" Hunter was talked out of the lead role in STAR TREK by his wife at the time, but even so this is the best episode of any of the STAR TREK series, and once it's over, you know that JEFFREY HUNTER IS THE REAL CAPTAIN OF THE ENTERPRISE!!!

243102,4,6300213056,"For ""Star Trek"" fans, this tape is - or at least, should be - required viewing, because this, my friends, is where it all started. Back in 1965, when he was trying to switch his focus from Westerns such as ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" to science fiction, Gene Roddenberry created his vision of a multiracial, sexually equal, peaceful future world, in which humanity took its rightful place out in the universe, with this rarely seen pilot, which was rejected by NBC for having been ""too cerebral"" - i.e., not violent enough. The starship Enterprise has an unfamiliar crew - a captain played by Jeffrey Hunter, and a mysterious and beautiful woman, known only as Number One, whose icy calm and mysterious presence predates the super-competent heroines of today (Scully, Xena, Buffy, etc.) by 30 years - but thankfully, Leonard Nimoy's immortal Vulcan science officer, Mr. Spock, is on board, although his jarringly emotional line readings seem bizarre to Trekkers who admire his later lack of visible passion. Talos IV is a war-ravaged planet, visited by the Enterprise crew, which is the home to telepathically powerful, but physically frail creatures, who wish to repopulate their shattered society by capturing Hunter's Captain Chris Pike (less stirring than William Shatner's James Kirk, but sympathetic and effective) and forcing him to mate with Vina, an orphan girl played by Susan Oliver; incredibly realistic illusions are employed as weapons against the spaceship's crew, but of course, you know who's going to win the contest, in the end. You can see how the show was evolving - energy weapons are referred to as ""lasers"" and the Enterprise uses ""time warps"" to get across vast space distances; perhaps most unusual for 1965 was not the use of aliens or persons of color, but the appointment of a woman to the second-in-command shot, something that made the network nervous back then - although ""Deep Space Nine"" would later put Major Kira in a similar role, it was just too far-reaching for Roddenberry to do so in the sexist Sixties. Check this show out; it's got action, humor, beautiful women, cool aliens, and of course, it's the first voyage of the starship Enterprise - what more do you need to know?",987206400,2,2212,4.948924731182796
243103,3,6300213056,"""The Cage"" is, of course, an important piece of Star Trek history and should certainly at least be seen (if not owned) by any completist.  I don't understand why this pilot was less acceptable to the network than the second pilot: ""Where No Man Has Gone Before.""  ""The Cage"" contains the full flavour that you might expect from a Star Trek episode.  Sure, much of the cast is different, but Spock is there (and Nimoy doesn't portay him much differently than he does in the other, early Star Trek episodes -- he smiles broadly at one point, but Spock frequently smirked and displayed facial emotion in the early days as he rambled on and on about the difference between his logic and ""earth emotions"").  Majel Barrett (Nurse Chapel, Lwaxanna Troi, Mrs. Gene Roddenberry) also has a prominent role as the original ""Number One"" (long before Picard ever thought of calling Riker that).
The ending of ""The Cage"" is different from the ending portrayed in flashback in ""The Menagerie.""  If you're a stickler for continuity, you'll have to decide for yourself which ending you prefer.
