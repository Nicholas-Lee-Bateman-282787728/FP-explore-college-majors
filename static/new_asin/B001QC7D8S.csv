The graphics and sound make you feel like you are in Book of Mormon times, and the questions create a sense of excitement that encourage scripture study. It is not a cheesy game; I feel that all levels can enjoy and participate.  My wife and I enjoyed playing, and we had fun with our opponents.  It really made me think, and I even learned some new things about the Book of Mormon!
