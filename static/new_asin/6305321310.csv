7887429,4,6305321310,"Carol Shaya (a real former NYC cop turned Playboy Cover Model), Frank Pellegrino (Copland, Goodfellas), Pat Cooper (small cameo). I was intrigued by the cover and title of this movie and it lived up to the box. This movie has a grabber opening and if you don't like graphic violence, this might not be for you. Carol Shaya is so sarcastic, something like Gina Gershon in ""Black and White"" and ""Insider"" both of which I also really enjoyed. She is also surrounded by a good cast. She is also cast in a part perfect for her but she really does have acting ability. I thought it was going to be an exploitation film but there is a good story. A jewish female cop goes undercover to solve rapes at a catholic school. In cop stories, I am SO TIRED of superiors fighting against the cops on the street. It doesn't happen in this movie, her captain supports her and stands up for her. It, of course, is still a somewhat exploitive film with crass humor but the story is interesting and it has some heart.",970963200,3,997,4.394594594594595
