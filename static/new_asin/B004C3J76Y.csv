Essentially, they made a lucrative business out of making very quickly and cheaply straight-to-video movies timed to be released around the timeframe of the matching blockbuster release.
New Line coming up with ""Snakes on a plane""? Asylum can release ""Snakes on a train"" just in time to hit Blockbuster shelves when the marketing campaign for New Line's movie starts.

I'm not a big fan of ""Battle: Los Angeles"" which is a pointless, plotless, rudderless display of technological wizardry. This version is pretty much the same, minus the talented actors and the high end CGI: the visual effects used in it are cheap, cheesy and unconvincing. Despite the thinness of the plot, it still manages to contain inconsistencies and omissions.

confusing this film with other title ""Battle: Los Angeles"" from
Sony.  Our review is based on this film <and not on mis-directed
judgement because ""it wasn't the right Film"">.

Battle Of Los Angeles focuses on the return of Aliens from Nineteen-forty-two.
They have returned to rescue an alien from their world that was apparently taken
hostage by the U S government.  In disguise of a human, the aliens place one
of the missing men <captain Rodgers played by former Porn Star Dylan Vox> to bait the american soldiers into having him contact their missing alien comrade. The fight ensues after it is revealed that Captain Rodgers is not human, and scramble for control and the ""battle"" begins.  This mock buster flick is made to mimic  the Sony
film ""battle: los angeles"".  It can be quite entertaining with mock visual
effects and broken story line which straightens out near the end.  The group
actually enjoyed it for lack of silly profanities found in most Hollywood
films.  David Edison <Walter Judson Group.com>",1361577600,3,1083,4.94475138121547

The obvious ripoffs from a number of films abound...the screenwriter is a black belt cut and paste artist but not much else.
I only point out that the soldiers are black because they are escorting a fly boy from WWII who never once notices the army now appears to consist of black commanders and women fighter pilots...a wonderful indication of integration and enlightenment today but pure horror in itself in 1943.
The production value is non existent and scripting is worse. Stay far, far away from this continuous train wreck of a SyFy movie that should be allowed a quiet death and a shallow grave.",1358553600,2,962,4.5606936416184976
4324549,3,B004C3J76Y,"So I'm reading this book called ""Something's Alive on the Titanic,"" by Robert Serling, the same author who wrote ""The President's Plane is Missing,"" ""Air Force One is Haunted,"" and ""Someone's Something is Something,"" except I made that last one up.

Anyway, the book is about a team of adventurers who dive to the Titanic, only to discover a monster down there. And we know this is true because of all those 1912 newspaper stories that quoted survivors saying, ""Thank God the Titanic sunk, because there was a monster on it."" See what I did there? I made that up, too.

Anyway again, I bring this book up not just because its plot is perfect for an Asylum film (if you're reading this, Barry Van Dyke, you're welcome), but because it inspired me to coin the phrase ""rip-roaring stupidity(tm).""

And so here we have ""Battle of Los Angeles,"" in which an alien ship literally the size of Los Angeles starts blowing up the city for no good reason, and the military responds by sending a few hot chicks in fighter jets to check it out.

Soon, the fate of the world is up to a half-dozen or so ragtag soldiers, because the rest of the U.S. military apparently has better things to do than save the world from an alien invasion.

Once the plot is established thus, the film requires only that you just sit back and enjoy the rip-roaring stupidity(tm). For instance:

-- The impossibly gravelly-voiced sergeant who barks out phrases like ""These ain't the Rooskies!"" and stoically fires his service revolver at a squadron of flying saucers blasting lasers at him.

-- The tank-like robot with a machine gun on its head that looks like an amalgam of a Dalek and a vacuum cleaner that the aliens sent to kill a neighborhood of people. For some reason.

-- The platoon leader who clings to life despite clearly being shot about 9,000 times by the Dalek vacuum.

-- The fighter pilot who can't seem to shake the flying saucer on her tail until she bravely ejects, taking out the alien ship when her plane's windshield flies into it.

-- The World War II pilot who shows up in a Corsair 68 years after being abducted by the aliens, who seems really, really cool until later in the movie, when we find out something very, very stupid about him.

-- The samurai babe. 'Nuff said.

We're soon introduced to one of the aliens and learn the real reason they're here, and to be honest, it's a rather nifty one (which I won't spoil for you here, but is easily learned on Wikipedia).

""Battle of Los Angeles"" is a mockbuster of the mainstream film ""Battle: Los Angeles,"" and if you dolled out good money at the theater for the latter when the former was a buck at Redbox, find someone to stooge-slap you.

4324553,1,B004C3J76Y,"I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan, which is why I decided to pick this up (used & not Amazon).

I still paid too much for it.

There's basically no start to this Movie - you're just pretty much in the middle of things right from the git go.

Special effects - holy cow are they bad.
In some of the Jet pictures you can see in the Cockpit and there's obviously no one in there.
No Jet flames/trails from the engines.
Unrealistic maneuvering of both Planes and Missiles.
Explosions look to be the quality of a fairly decent video game - e.g. not realistic.

Characters - Like some others have said, no development really at all.
The Female Pilot just makes think of a Gangbanger/Hoodlum - no respect for others and zero discipline.

Plot - This is maybe the one area where there was just an inkling of a glow, but it's still really bad.
The good:
A bit of a Time Traveller twist.
Ultimate nature of the threat is not totally predictable.

The mediocre:
They reference their Ultra base as MJ-12 . . . I guess trying to capitalize on Majectic 12 for anyone that has an inkling of what that refers too.
Foo Fighters are also encountered in this escapade. I wonder how many people are even aware of what that is other than the Rock Group?
Of course we also have the obligatory reference to Roswell in here as well. I guess we need to work in all the Cliches.
There are a scene or two or three right out of Independence Day, though no where near as well carried out.

The bad:
This boils down to no Character development.
You just seem to keep moving on and on with no real insight in motivation or actions of any of the Actors.
The Ending . . . is it really over? That's it? That's how it ends? Yeow.

Verdict:
The first time I tried to watch this I made it to almost the 10 minute mark.
I kept seeing these ""fair"" to ""decent"" ratings for this Movie, so I forced myself to watch the whole thing at a later date - seems I confused this with ""Battle: Los Angeles"".

There were some wrinkles in the plot, it just wasn't put together well, the lines/acting just wasn't there.
There were also some pretty good sized gaps in plot/lines/acting.

Overall, it wasn't worth the $5 I paid for it, it's definitely going to the resell pile.
On the positive side, it's better than Skyline, but worse than 2012 (which wasn't THAT bad).",1313798400,,2302,4.30787037037037
4324554,1,B004C3J76Y,"I generally only review movies that inspire a good review (or that I get paid for reviewing). If the movie is not up to my viewing pleasure, I simply don't waste my time. However, ""Battle of Los Angeles (2011)"" was so incredibly bad, that I had to break with tradition.

In this era where even a novice CGI artist can create amazing special effects, it was mindboggling how a professional movie company could produce a [less than] amateurish movie. Aside from the horrific FX work, putting a camcorder in the hands of a monkey could have produced better cinematography.

As to plot ... it was nonsensical; sorely lacking logic of any kind. Strange, out-of-place, characters (a time-traveling droid/humanoid jet pilot, and a sword-wielding middle-aged female samurai-warrior) appeared out of nowhere. To make matters worse, none of the other characters appeared surprised by their sudden appearance. There were far too many ""What the Frail"" moments to warrant any respect to the screenwriter or the director.

I felt increasingly sorry for the actors as one scene limped into another. The cast did the best they could with the material provided. Yet, I had to wonder what ran through the minds of the producers when they backed this project.

And I actually watched the whole thing, too!

This movie is actually tough to assign stars.  I mean, the effects were cheesy, but the acting was bad.  It's actually so bad that it's kind of good.  The screen writing and dialog is way down there (but it's not loaded with lots of swearing that I can recall, and that's good), but the props and sets were quite forgetable.

The soldiers were incredibly good at giving orders and incredibly bad at following them, and fairly type-cast.  It's amazing anyone survived!

There is also a largely unexplained space-time conundrum involving a WWII era pilot, space aliens whose ship settles menacingly over downtown LA and sends out hoards of small fighter ships (sound familiar?...think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day-Single-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005V9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>), and some kind of top secret agency who employs a sword wielding agent/operative.

Still, this movie was all in good fun.  It's got to watched as a mocu-action-sci-fi-adventure to be properly appreciated.

4324569,2,B004C3J76Y,"Sadly, ""Battle of Los Angeles"" is at best a two-star movie. Kel Mitchell, Nia Peeples, and Theresa Jun-Tao give good performances.  Unfortnately, the movie's plot is sketchy and makes no logical sense.

The movie has a promising opening with a large saucer hovering over Los Angeles.  Adequate jet fighter effects are shown, and that's the last battle the military has with the saucer.  The movie then focuses on Kel Mitchell and Theresa Jun-Tao, introduces Nia Peeples, and . . . well, then the saucer is destroyed.  End of movie.

The Good:
* Only the acting is good.  If one watches the acting, all of the actors pull their weight and then some.
* Kel Mitchell plays an Army Reserve(?) pilot with a slight attitude.
* Theresa Jun-Tao plays a no-nonsense, tough pilot.  Her character does not complain and also has an attitude.
* Nia Peeples plays a sword-carrying member of Majestic 12; that makes this an Asylum movie.  Even cooler, Nia Peeples looks like Steranko's Nick Fury by movie's end.

The Bad:
* Good special effects can make up for a bad script, but the special effects are only adequate.
* This script is bad.
* Several interesting but minor characters are introduced, used, and disappear or are killed.
* Man, the script is bad.
* The aliens are odd-looking in a bad way.  One looks like the offspring of Eraserhead and E.T.  Another is a huge CGI starfish-headed snake-slug who operates a remote control with his tentacle.  Without eyes or digits, this second alien somehow controls the whole saucer.
* MJ-12 is not explained.  The aliens are not explained.  Nothing is explained.  The movie seems like a 30-minute movie or radio drama stretched a bit thin.

Why did I buy this movie?  I did not have high expectations for the plot and special effects, so two of my normal three reasons were null and void from the start.  The other reason that I bought the movie was for the acting.  The three main actors raise the movie from one-star status, and that made the movie worth watching.

The movie pretty much combines every single sci fi genre there is. There are aliens, its survival horror, it has time travel, mind control, a lost alien, buildings blowing up, army vs ufo. It has it all and you know what? It fails....big time. I couldn't think of one good thing about the movie.

The characters are boring and unbelievable.

One specific scene takes a stab at E.T. The army has a captured alien (they had it for years) that loved Recees Pieces. Heck I even expected to be E.T at the rate the movie was going. The plot was slow movie, what was maybe an hour...felt like 2 hours.

4324612,3,B004C3J76Y,"I don't mind my movies dumb, but suspending my disbelief has its limits. I never went into this movie expecting much and was not disappointed. The acting was horrible, almost embarrassingly so in spots. Things couldn't have been more hammed up than ""the sarge"" character who was played by Robert Pike Daniel. As Commander Wakes, he couldn't have played a ""sarge"" better than R. Lee Ermey and why he was a commander instead of just an enlisted puke was beyond me. Dylan Vox plays the young Lt. Pete Rogers, a pilot that somehow ""Sarge"" knew had been trapped in time and landed at their base to bring them a message. The kid either had horrible acting chops or else, as it became evident later on, he wasn't quite right.

Then there is Theresa June Tao, or as she is known, Solano. She is the F-16 pilot that is blown out of the sky. As the heroes are trekking across the wasteland that is what is left of the destroyed Los Angeles, they somehow come across an intact F-16 that they recognize as Solano's plane! Then by one miracle of a plot device (as if finding an intact crashed F-16 isn't one in itself), they find Solano running around right next to the plane.

Nia Peeples character was pretty cool though the whole premise for her being there didn't seem to make any sense at all, except that she is hot. A ninja sort of character in a military alien setting? Did I miss something here? She just shows up as the military guys are rescuing Solano. She is a key character that really makes no sense.

That is just a taste of some of the suspended disbelief the writers asked me to swallow in this far-fetched tale. What am I saying? This is an icky bug movie, so of course, just the whole premise is far-fetched! But come on, at least give it some semblance of reality!

Since I mentioned the icky bugs, let's talk about them. The CGI for the space ships is not bad and as others have mentioned, it is up to par with what they are doing in Vancouver lately. The icky bugs themselves were not bad, though I didn't get too good of a look at them. That may have been because by the time they made their appearance, it was getting late and I was starting to nod off.

I do remember some heroics against the icky bugs where a couple of the heroes didn't make it, but won't say who. I will say that the city of Los Angeles and the icky bugs didn't come out on the top end of that deal! As for the population of the city, throughout the entire movie, I didn't see anyone at all except the actors, even in the background. Any non-military people that survived out of the millions of inhabitants were never acknowledged.

It was becoming a game for us to determine what they were mimicing at any given time. I will probably buy it because of that only. The acting, CGI and storyline were all typical of the scifi channel.",1299888000,7,386,4.375
4324616,1,B004C3J76Y,I am attempting to watch this movie on SyFy right now. It is extremely terrible. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this piece of trash. The acting is terrible as well as the special effects and the story. I was only able to watch 15 minutes of this. Too bad I can't go back in time to get those minutes back.,1299888000,3,320,4.015625

Picture, sound and features playback is superb. A good, solid movie with stunning effects, strong characters, strong storyline, with humans facing down bad-ass aliens, hell on world conquest, like as seen in Independance Day.
