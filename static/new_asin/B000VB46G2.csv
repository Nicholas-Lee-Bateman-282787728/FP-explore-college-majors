8217915,5,B000VB46G2,"I watch this series repeatedly on rental videos and had a request from a soldier in Afghanistan.  Made his day.  The humor suits us perfectly in our household.  A cast of quirky characters interact in a tiny fictional town in Saskatchewan, Canada.  They make fun of themselves and have marvelous story lines.  A great laugh, adult humor in the best sense- sophisticated and dry, not raw.  Love these guys!",1331337600,,405,4.797101449275362
8217916,5,B000VB46G2,"Corner Gas looks like a small little town - it's in Saskatchewan, Canada, in the show, but could even be Anywhere, USA - with ""Not a lot goin' on."" But the wit employed by the characters, and the interplay of family and friends, is come-from-behind funny. From Brent, who reads comic books and stiffly resists anything physically taxing, to his friend Hank, who just makes everyone shake their heads...then we have Brent's parents...whew! Brainy, quirky, loving, and just fun. And the opening and closing songs are catchy!",1203897600,2,522,5.011494252873563
