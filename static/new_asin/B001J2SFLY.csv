8311785,3,B001J2SFLY,"Amazon's suggestion bundles this DVD with the other DVDs from Echo Bridge.  They give the impresion that the DVDs are part of a package of DVDs that will have different episodes on each DVD.  This is not the case.  Since two of the DVDs come from Echo Bridge and the third from Alpha there is a repeat of episodes.  All of the episodes on the Alpha DVD are on the Echo Bridge DVDs hence it makes no sense for Amazon to make a recommendation to buy the Alpha version as a group.  Bad advice. The Alpha DVD Shotgun Slade Volume 3 has ""Ring of Death"", ""Sudden Death"", ""The Charcoal Bullet"", ""The Fabulous Fiddle"".  Alpha does offer Volumes 1 & 2.

Video quality is what you should expect from a old TV program scratches and not too clean looking picture.  Echo's version is slightly better but not much.",1345161600,3,800,4.394557823129252
