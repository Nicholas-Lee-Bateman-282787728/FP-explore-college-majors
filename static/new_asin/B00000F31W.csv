Great story and great telling. Anybody would enjoy this, maybe younger kids would be bored though...Over all great buy.",1299542400,,268,4.604166666666667
7906720,5,B00000F31W,"The video ""Dangerous Journey"" based on John Bunyan's classic ""Pilgrim's Progress"" is not just a children's video.  Through excellent narration and grapic pictures, this video tells the story of Christian's journey from his home in the ""City of Destruction"" to the ""Celestial City"".  But it is a journey filled with great danger as he faces the menacing temptations of Mr. Worldy Wisman, Hypocrisy, Mistrust and others; enters in fierce battle with Apolloyon; travels through he valley of the shadow of death; is captured by Giant Despair; and encounters many other dangers and temptations - all in the hope of reaching the Celestial City.
The video remains faithful to Bunyan's classic story, and graphically draws the viewer into the story - and into our own spiritual journey from our state of ""destruction"" weighed down by our burdens - through the release of our burdens at the cross - to the joy of an eternal life with God.
  I have used this video with groups of children and adults in th church.  It is an excellent video through which to learn - and teach - the basic tenets of the Christian faith.  I recommend it very highly.",1018224000,16,1136,4.8
