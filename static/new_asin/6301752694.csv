351490,5,6301752694,"This classic cartoon features the voice of Bing Crosby in Washington Irving's tale of the schoolmaster who loved the fair Katrina, but also believed in spooks!  Children over age 7 will love to be scared by this funny Halloween tale...but keep the lights on!  5 stars!",1024012800,21,268,4.804347826086956
351491,5,6301752694,"""The Old Crooner"" himself, Bing Crosby, narrates and sings this cartoon classic based on Washington Irving's All Hallow's Eve tale.  Extremely exomorphic educator  Ichabod Crane is competing against Brom Bones ( an ancestor to Gaston in Beauty and the Beast?) for Katrina, the wealthy farmer's daughter. So is it Brom or the Legendary Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow pursuing Ichabod through the perilous forest?
Disney set the high standard in animation.  Here, the initial and moonlit views of Old Baltus van Tassel's farm and the woods are reminiscent of Van Gogh's Starry Night. This is a must-have Disney Classic.",1016409600,37,621,5.252525252525253
351532,5,6301752694,This is exactly what I expected...a classic vintage for little kids around Halloween.  This item was in excellent condition despite its age...my daughters both loved it!,1416787200,,169,5.5
351533,5,6301752694,"Excellent quality, fast delivery.",1416355200,,33,7.5
351534,4,6301752694,This is an age old classic I have enjoyed since childhood. It is fun for all ages and not as dark as the more recent remakes.,1414540800,,125,3.8461538461538463
351535,5,6301752694,Been watching this since I was a kid.  Got all my grand kids hooked on it and that is who I bought these for!,1410739200,,109,3.5416666666666665

351538,5,6301752694,"I'm 22 years old, I've been a Disney nut all my life, and I literally just saw this cartoon for the first time ever when I purchased Ichabod & Mr Toad on VHS last week. All I can say really, is that Disney's Legend Of Sleepy Hollow is fantastic on its own, and may just be my new favourite Disney short for not only Halloween, but all year round. I purchased it on VHS by itself, and I'm waiting for it to come in, but I think it deserves a release of it's own. If Mickey's Christmas Carol can have a DVD/blu ray release all it's own, why can't this one?",1402790400,4,554,4.0
351539,5,6301752694,The original timeless classic. DISNEY created this animated version of the classic short story which every kid from my generation X has seen more than once. This was probably the darkest animated tale that Disney has ever done and that's why I love it so much.  Icabod Crane is the mild-mannered teacher who doesn't believe the local legend of The Headless Horseman. Enjoy the rich bold colors and the golden days of Disney animation!,1396224000,5,434,4.864864864864865
351540,5,6301752694,"We loved this cartoon when we were kids, and it brought back a lot of good memories.  We got it to show the kids and the grandkids.  We all enjoyed it immensely.  I would recommend it to any and all families.",1394582400,2,208,4.024390243902439
351541,4,6301752694,This was one of my all time favorites on The Wonderful World of Disney when I was  little. It is as much fun now as it was then. My granddaughters love it too now.,1391731200,,163,3.7941176470588234
351565,5,6301752694,"Wonderful movie, no comparison to the ones made after it.  It may be a Disney animation movie, but it follows Washington Irving's book to a T.  Everything in the animation, people, country, and houses had to be really researched to get it so correct.  I pull this flick out every Halloween week and watch it.

Thanks",1388275200,5,316,4.589285714285714
351566,5,6301752694,"The old classic Disney movie I saw as a child.  It's still so good, scary and fun to watch.  For children and adults of all ages.",1384905600,,129,3.923076923076923
351567,5,6301752694,Very pleased with my purchase. The VHS was in excellent condition. Wish it came out on DVD though. My son really enjoyed the film.,1383609600,,130,4.458333333333333
351568,5,6301752694,"This Disney classic was one my wife and I remembered when we were kids.  Now that we're grandparents we wanted to show them the video.  We finally had a chance to watch it last night and enjoyed every minute of it.  The headless horseman still gave us the chills, especially when he threw the lighted pumpkin.",1383004800,,309,4.482142857142857
351569,4,6301752694,"I bought this video tape a while back. I was pleased with the the product in regards to the seller's description, and it was what I had ordered. The shipping was prompt and the price was right. Really, the only thing that I wish I could have changed was the fact that I bought it in VHS form. Other than that, it's a classic and I really wanted it and I would recommend buying products from the seller in the future!!",1375401600,,417,4.160493827160494
351570,4,6301752694,"Actually purchased for granddaughters so they could enjoy Disney magic.  They are 7 & 5 and enjoyed it as much as I did watching it on the Mickey Mouse Club.  A way to introduce them to good American writers, Bing Crosby and a good old time story.
Quality of tape was excellent.",1369353600,,278,4.326923076923077
351571,5,6301752694,"I love this video! I bought this as a gift for my son and his children, as they love it as well.  I only wish Disney would come out with the DVD or Blu-ray version of these great old classics!",1367798400,,192,3.8

351573,3,6301752694,"I bought the original video of Sleepy Hallow like mines but its very delicate, my VHS player isn't gentle anymore so it almost broke this one too, it is an old copy too because its the exact same one as mines that broke, I'd try looking for a DVD copy since VHS are out of style pretty much, but I got it for a steal.",1359849600,,317,3.8923076923076922
351574,5,6301752694,"cool movie took me back to when I was a kid , too bad they don't have it in dvd but at least i have it",1356998400,,102,2.9615384615384617
351588,4,6301752694,It was exactly as described and I remembered.  Disappointed Disney has not chosen to re-release in DVD form.  Mailing took a little longer than normal but all arrived safe and sound.,1354492800,,182,4.838709677419355
351589,5,6301752694,"I grew up watching this movie. I always loved it.  I bought it and my kids got the biggest kick out of it.

A must watch video!!!",1350172800,,129,3.740740740740741
351590,5,6301752694,"This is a must own for anyone wanting to celebrate the fall season. The perfect cartoon to curl up and watch with your children on a dark and spooky night. Bing Crosby is perfect as the narrator of the show and it has that classic Disney feel that was lost long ago. Grab some hot apple cider, get the fire roaring and flip this one for magical evening with the family.",1317686400,2,369,4.211267605633803
351591,5,6301752694,"I have loved this cartoon since I was a child and just had to have it for my ""Grandkids""! It is funny, yet, scary and I will play it again and again when Halloween comes around! A Classic!",1311120000,,188,3.973684210526316
351592,3,6301752694,"Item was $40.00 VHS tape with attached book...only one available. When received the book had been ripped off. Didn't want the book to begin with but no other choice. It was a gift so not happy about appearance or rip off.

351593,5,6301752694,"First out in the 1950's, this classic animated telling of The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow is a must have when Halloween nears! Tame enough for children, entertaining for any age!",1269734400,,174,4.833333333333333
351594,1,6301752694,"I loved this move as a kid so I was excited to show my own kids.  When we started the movie it was all wavy on the screen and had a blue tint.  The sound was messed up as well.  I wonder if it was a boot-leg copy??  It was delivered to my house all wrapped in newspaper for protection so maybe it was damaged in transit?  There was no return address or instructions for sending it back, so I couldn't even return the movie.  I paid over $40 for this movie - I guess buyer beware!!",1255996800,,480,3.8969072164948453
351595,5,6301752694,My family has watched this show for 20 years!  Fall isn't Fall without watching it and we laugh like we've never seen it before.  The expressions on the characters' faces are especially perfect.,1224547200,,194,4.848484848484849
351596,5,6301752694,"Disney is so obsessed with Hannah Montana and High School Musical, they're forgetting about us ""Boomers"" who grew up on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"".  A Halloween classic like ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" should not be cast aside.  I want to show it to my grandchildren and it's nowhere to be found!  This classic version narrated by Bing Crosby never goes out of style.  PLEASE BRING IT BACK!",1193011200,6,397,4.7101449275362315
7814676,5,6301752694,I received in new condition and sooner than I thought. Its great that the VHS came with a small book as well so I can also read it to my daughter.,1507334400,,146,3.7419354838709675
7814677,5,6301752694,"The darkest but truist of the Disney collection, Sleepy Hollow's animated version narrated by Bing Crosby, is by far the finest family animated movie, plenty of versions, even that annoying abbrivated version. That's the one with 10 minutes of Bing's narration!
Don't be tricked by that one. Quite pale by comparison.
Fantasia and Sleepy Hollow are the most timeless of family entertainment, Hopefully, the DVD version will be re-released by 2017, in time for great stocking stuffers!!!",1492041600,,486,5.324675324675325
