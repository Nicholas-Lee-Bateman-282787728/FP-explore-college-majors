8172881,4,B000MV9OG8,"The Poverty Row films that Frankie Darro and Grant Withers made in the early 1930's are usually full of breakneck action, speeding cars, fast horses, endless fistfights, stolen loot, and a pretty girl or two. ""Valley of Wanted Men"" is no exception.

Three convicts break out of state prison, Grant Withers being one of them. Withers was framed and convicted of a robbery. The other two convicts with him were actually guilty of the same crime. All three want to find the man who double crossed them and has all the stolen loot that was hidden away from the robbery. Withers wants to clear his name without letting the secret of his innocence be known to the other two escapees.

In the meantime, the brains of the robbery (now a respectible member of the community) is courting Withers former girlfriend who happens to be Frankie Darro's sister. When Withers and the other two escapees show up at a remote mountain lodge, they find Frankie, Frankie's sister, and a group of tourists from the city enjoying a weekend getaway.

In secret, Frankie vows to help Withers clear his name and to help get his own sister out of the evil clutches of the old gang's ringleader and back into the arms of Withers. That's a tall order considering that the sheriff, his posse, and some forest rangers are all combing the surrounding area for the three escaped convicts.

This plot may sound complicated, but it's just the usual fun and games in a low-budget thriller like this. Alpha's version of this movie is watchable and the sound is not too bad. So sit back, relax, and see how much non-stop action can be crammed into 59 minutes.",1314662400,,1620,4.653846153846154
