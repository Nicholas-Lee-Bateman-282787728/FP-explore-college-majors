8082175,5,B000B64TZU,"This movie was a brave effort in 1979, being an entertaining drama that documented the movie newsreel scene in the late 1940's through to the advent of television here in 1956 for the Melbourne Olympic Games.  It contained actual archival footage of significant local events during that time, with the lives of the people working in that industry woven into the story.  As with many movies of that era, it was a roll call of all of the best Aussie actors of the time, including Bryan Brown who went on to many bigger and better things.  The film won eight out of ten available categories in the 1979 AFI awards, and was worth adding to my collection to watch again.",1374969600,,665,4.525
8082176,5,B000B64TZU,"Phillip Noyce's first major hit ""Newsfront"" (1978, AFI best film) employs most of Australia's most celebrated actors in a wonderfully edited story about the dying days of cinema newsreels just before the advent of TV. The life of a newsreel cameraman (Bill Hunter, AFI Best Actor) is intercut with genuine newsreel footage of the fifties and sixties in Australia, the flood sequence a highlight. Personal stories are interwoven around the devoted efforts of the competing camera teams to return first with the best footage. Newsreels of the day are fascintating to see now and the talented all-star cast enliven the soap-opera nature of the characters' lives. Angela Punch (AFI best supporting actress) leads an excellent supporting cast including Chris Haywood, Wendy Hughes, Gerard Kennedy, John Ewart, Don Crosbie, Bryan Brown, Drew Forsythe, Gerry Duggan, Anne Haddy and many other familiar faces. On the whole an entertaining and engrossing film about an exciting bygone era.",1362873600,,980,5.37012987012987
8082177,4,B000B64TZU,"A film that will remind  Australian baby boomers of how it was & educate gen Y & Xer's. It will delight viewers from elsewhere who are not familiar with Australia or her history. A great cast of prominent actors including the venerable Bill Hunter & Brian Brown. It cleverly uses actual Black & white news footage incorporated into the story which is about 2 cinema news companies (pre T.V.), one Australian the other American, in competition with one another covering events in Australia & screening film of overseas events that have been flown in, probably days after the event. (how the world has changed).",1333065600,,609,4.855769230769231
8082178,4,B000B64TZU,"This was not exactly what I was expecting but I did enjoy it.  Knowing nothing about the broadcasting industry, I found it very interesting to see it and learn about it from this point of view.  The characters were shown in such a way as to be believable.  Although they may not always have been behaving perfectly, I found myself identifying with them as ""real"" and realizing that like all of us, they are only human and make mistakes.  It was refreshing not to have a ""Hollywood"" script or ending.",1209686400,2,499,4.511111111111111
8082179,5,B000B64TZU,"The late 1970s-early 1980s was a time of frenetic activity in the Australian movie industry, one which saw the production of films such as ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", ""My Brilliant Career"", ""Gallipoli"" and ""Breaker Morant"".  However even against such excellent company ""Newsfront"" stands out as the finest film of its time, and possibly the best Australian film yet made.

Most Australian films of that time, even the very best, tended to exhibit a slightly self-conscious ""Australianness"".  It was historically a time when Australians rediscovered their ""roots"" and were keen to present their culture to the world.  Consequently many of these films can look a little quaint or provincial, for all their undoubted quality.  ""Newsfront"", in contrast, had a storyline which, whilst it was thoroughly Australian in context, was completely accessible to a woldwide audience.

It also boasted a cast which included some of the best local actors ever to grace the screen, a very strong script, and high production values.  The combination of historic newsreel footage studio shots and location photography was perfectly handled, and the score was inspired.

One of the most interesting facets is the way in which the style of cinematography, music and dialogue production change during the course of the film.  Just as the story covers a period of great technical change, the film itself evolves during its 110 minutes from shaky black and white handheld shots with an accompanying post war soundtrack to slick colour with a fine orchestral soundtrack.  This is not, however just an obvious gimmick - it is a very gradual and subtle change, which may not even be consciously noticed on the first viewing.

A wonderful and rewarding film which is as fresh now as it was on its release in 1978.",1131753600,7,1784,5.096219931271477
