393881,5,630196781X,"This movie is absulutely a masterpiece. A great horror movie.  Frederic March gives a stunning performance, I must say.  When I first saw the Hyde character, I had to wonder if that was Frederic March behind all that make  up.  It's not that faithful to the R.L. Stevenson novel, but it still  is a great story.  It focuses quite a bit on the love/lust angle, but  doesn't turn into a romance.  This is a great movie all around, good  acting, story, cinematography, (the first transformation from Jekyll to  Hyde where the camera spins was a really big innovation becase the camera  made alot of sound, so they put it in a soundproof thingy and it couldn't  be moved.) and very imaginative; those few parts when you see the world  through Jekyll's eyes is cool. Miriam Hopkins' portrayel of Ivy is great,  she is really believable.  One more thing.  At the party scene, where  Rose Something (forgot her last name) is wearing that dress, if you look  behind them when they're going out in the garden, there's a woman wearing  an identical dress.  This is a great movie that is really great. I  liked it and recommend it to anyone, no matter what genre you prefer.  At  times, March's performance almost moved me to tears.  Excellent!",949708800,3,1233,4.627906976744186
393882,5,630196781X,"I was thoroughly impressed with Fredric March's performance in this version (he won the best actor Oscar for this in 1932) and thought the Spencer Tracy film done nine years later wasn't nearly as effective visually or performance-wise. Rouben Mamoulian directed this with meticulous care and it's good fun. Miriam Hopkins gives her classic interpretation of poisonous Ivy and her scenes with Mr. Hyde are amazing. There are dated scenes in the film, such as Dr. Jekyll encouraging the little crippled girl to walk (she's a pain), but one has to rememember the it takes place in the Victorian era. The bland Rose Hobart plays Jekyll's love interest Muriel and Halliwell Hobbes is her properly patient father, the role Donald Crisp played beautifully in the otherwise rather inept 1941 version.  Stevenson's classic 1885 horror story was first adapted for the stage in 1887; at the Venice Film Festival, this film was voted ""The most original and dramatic film"". Censored for re-release in the late thirties, the film was finally restored in 1989 by Turner Entertainment for home video release.",944265600,,1093,5.106145251396648
393883,2,630196781X,"The film is cinematically fluent enough, thoroughly professional, and it is obvious to see why the great Frederic March won an Academy Award for this. But I have to admit to being tremendously let down by this film for  an infuriating reason: it was unintentionally hilarious. ""Jekyll &  Hyde"" is just one of those stories that I HAVE to take seriously to  feel the terror. But how can you be terrified by a villain who is a Jerry  Lewis ""Nutty Professor"" clone? I suspect that Hyde turned out so  unwittingly like a grotesque doofus because of the recent success of  ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein""; so some priggish makeup  man, left to his own devices, recreated a corrupt image of his taskmaster  tutor. I'm sorry, but I am now convinced that the famous novel has never  approached success on the Hollywood screen!",925430400,,815,4.764285714285714
393884,3,630196781X,"An interesting performance from the always reliable Spencer Tracy makes up for some rather boring interludes in this over-padded version. Some reviewers accused Tracy of hamming it up but I think he projects the  evilness of Hyde quite well. The film lingers too long on the  out-of-date,hypocritical morality of the Victorian age and takes too long  in getting on with the story.  The 1932 version with Frederic March is  probably the best one.",923875200,,445,5.041095890410959
393885,4,630196781X,"Watched this film before taking in Mary Reilly, the 1996 version.  The scene of Tracy as Hyde dreaming of driving a carriage full-speed, then having the horses turn into Beatrix and Ivy, was a powerful and disturbing  image.  I thought it was much better than Mary Reilly, except for the  undeniable sex appeal of both stars.  But, hey, who could beat Ingrid  Bergman showing the good Dr. Jekyll her ankle.  Now that's sexy!",913766400,4,424,4.726027397260274

However a fairly recent review posted that his set was 4 discs. So I decided hey maybe they updated the set and went ahead and bought them. Well apparently there are two version of this set out there. I already own freaks and the haunting separately so I'll probably just find a four disc set case and consolidate discs.

394450,5,630196781X,"I recently reviewed the book of Jekyll and Hyde and then watched both this 1941 version and the Fredric March 1932 version, and this review is a comparison of all three. In my review of the book, I mentioned a few things that made the story work so well, and even as I did, I could see that some of them wouldn't work at all well on film. So I anticipated that the basic story would be changed, and decided that I would be looking to see how well the films stuck to the spirit rather than the actual plot.

London fog is a major character in the book, beautifully described and working both to give a scary atmosphere and as a metaphor for the darkness hidden within each human soul. I was disappointed to see that neither film made real use of this. Each shows the fog at one point and March makes a mention of it in the 1932 version, but it doesn't ever get used to obscure acts of wickedness or to show London as a place where viciousness lives side by side with respectability. Interestingly, when I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/London-Fog-The-Biography/dp/0674088352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">London Fog: The Biography</a>&nbsp;recently, Corton mentioned that the fog created for use in films used to make cast and crew feel ill, so I guess directors probably chose to use it sparingly. But I missed it.

In fact, neither film gave a particularly atmospheric picture of London at all. I suspect they were both made mainly in the studio, and anachronisms abound  in dress, speech, manners. The sets are kept limited, for cost reasons presumably, so there is little prowling around dark alleyways. The Tracy film does better here, showing some contrast between the ultra respectable areas and the seamier side of life. But overall the films both rely more on dialogue and acting than on creating visual atmosphere.

The book gives very little indication of what Mr Hyde's vices actually consist of and this works perfectly in written form, leaving the reader to her/his own imagination. Clearly it would never work in a film though. This 1941 film is obviously based on the 1932 version, so both have gone for the same addition to the story line  the introduction of two beautiful women, one the fiance of Dr Jekyll, the other a prostitute (1932) or good-time girl (1941) who becomes Hyde's unwilling mistress and major victim. In both cases this works brilliantly as a way to show the contrast between his good and evil sides and his struggle once evil begins to take him over.

The 1932 film has two lovely actresses who both turn in strong performances  Rose Hobart as Muriel, the fiance, and Miriam Hopkins as Ivy the prostitute. Ivy's transition from extremely saucy temptress to terrified victim is excellent, and though the physical violence mostly happens off-screen, the psychological torture Hyde uses on her is chillingly horrific.

The 1942 film has Lana Turner as fiance Bea, and Ingrid Bergman as Ivy. Now, I shall admit bias here  I have adored Ingrid Bergman my entire life. In fact, as a child I wanted to be her when I grew up. She is stunningly gorgeous and a great actress, especially in these vulnerable, woman as victim roles. Her portrayal of flirty, tempting Ivy at the beginning is charming and her terror once Hyde has her under his brutal control is superb. So... I was prepared to overlook her extremely dodgy attempt at a kind of Cockney accent! At least she made an attempt, which is more than could really be said for either Lana or Spencer, who both sound cheerfully American throughout.

As far as the women go, acting honours come out about even  fine performances all round  with the 1932 edging it in terms of authenticity of accent, but Bergman's performance just outshining Hopkins' for me.

The men, Fredric March and Spencer Tracy, are just about equally good in my opinion  again I have a huge soft spot for Spencer Tracy, but I could see why many people rate March's performance as the better of the two. Which brings me neatly to the crux of the matter  it is in the character of Jekyll/Hyde that the two films finally diverge, making one an adaptation faithful to the spirit of the book, and the other a kind of schlock horror  excellent, but wrong.

The book makes it clear that Jekyll has always had vices but now finds it difficult to indulge them due to his increasing fame. So he is never a truly good man  he is a weak man, whose evil side comes to dominate him more and more. The March film gets this so wrong, portraying Jekyll as some kind of angel, caring for the poor and needy out of goodness of heart. Not so the Tracy version, which has Jekyll single-mindedly pursuing his objectives, carrying out experiments on animals, and people if he can get the chance, and not needing much temptation from Bergman to stray from the path of righteousness.

And again, the book says specifically that Hyde suffers from no obvious physical deformity  his evil is in his nature, not his physical being. The Tracy film is spot on  though his appearance changes, he remains a man  coarsened, perhaps, but not head-turningly grotesque. March turns into the ape-man! He does it brilliantly, but still  it's ridiculous! By the end he's leaping about up and down shelves like some kind of manic chimpanzee! His body language is that of an animal  all twitches and sniffs. Tracy is always a fully human man  much more chilling when he turns to evil and, more importantly, true to Stevenson's creation.

So, both films are very enjoyable and I had huge fun immersing myself in the story again and again. But in terms of Film of the Book  the 1941 version wins hands down. Take a bow, Mr Fleming and Mr Tracy! Great adaptation!",1456617600,,5717,4.748484848484848

394651,5,630196781X,The Rouben Mamoulian version of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde is extremely good. Great photography and sets create the atmosphere of Victorian London.

394694,4,630196781X,Wonderful cinematography - the black and white film glistens like one of those old silver tinted photographs. Fredric March is excellent! You can see why he got the Oscar for this performance; he plays Hyde like he has just come alive for the first time on his life - lots of stretching and deep breathing. March's Hyde is frighteningly cruel. But it's Miriam Hopkins who REALLY shines in this. Outstanding. I think this is my favorite of the Jekyll / Hyde franchise.,1443139200,,467,4.7073170731707314
394695,5,630196781X,"I enjoyed Spencer Tracey's acting in Jekyll & Hyde, some people have stated that his acting in this movie is weak, however I believe that the fault lies with the director Victor Fleming (not the actor).

I bought the collection for the other three movies included, and was highly disappointed with them after viewing. Freaks was a weird awful movie, hardly worth viewing, let alone, having in my collection. House of Wax was another outdated low thrill ""Horror"" movie, with so many slow scenes, and wasted dialogue, it was hard to sit through. The Haunting was another boring low thrill so called Horror movie. The main character could not make up her mind why she was at this haunted house, was scared for her life, but somehow said she loved this place and wanted to stay! No real killings took place, just based all its horror content on weird hammering noises, door knobs that would turn by themselves, and other doors bulging in and out. Another waste of time.
All these comments are from a person who loves the old true horror flicks of the past, and does not have to see blood and gore. So many of today's thriller horror movies are so much more engrossing with some real thrills and chills.

 Up until he made this and he made a couple of talking pictures, he was known as a song and dance and light comedy actor .
 That along shows how great an actor he was becoming and would remain for several decades.
  Showing Jekyll as a frustrated man of contradicting age of the story (Late 1800s) and his sexual release and more, much more in a debasing and pure evil as shown on the screen in horrifying detail. My goodness, he was for all intents and purposes transformed into a talking werewolf or ape. You can't take your eyes off the screen during the transformations. Great special effects for that time. And what great acting by March as he jumps around and leers and sets out on the town to enjoy his new release on life. No holds barred. And you must remember this was made during the era forever known after as the age of forbidden film making (1929- 1934). Almost anything was allowed until mid 1934.
Mention also must be made the alluring and sexy and venerable performance by Miriam Hopkins as Hyde's forced sexual slave. Was she ever sorry for telling the good doctor, "" You will come back, won't you as she shakes her leg and throws her garter his way as she lays on her bed )
 Does she ever regret dong that as Hyde comes back to destroy her.
 In comparison The 1941 version is oh so tame . It is not anywhere near as terrifying as the 1932 version. Both had wonderful acting but the 1932 version is the best version by a wide margin.",1426464000,7,1558,4.318493150684931

However, it was precisely for these differences in the film that made me pity poor Dr. Jekyll in the film. Making him young and anxious to be married  made his fascination with Hyde understandable. He was bored, nave, impulsive, morbidly curious, and lonely.  In the book, I felt he was an unsympathetic and weak coward, perhaps because being 50, without familial ties, and widely successful he should have known better. This Jekyll at least had his noble moments, and I felt sad when he had to leave his fianc&eacute;e.",1421798400,,694,4.626016260162602

394873,5,630196781X,"No one is a bigger fan of the Universal horror classics than I am. But it is Paramount's 1932 version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde that is the greatest horror film ever made. For several reasons. First off, this movie still packs a wallop that none of the other classics of horror do and that includes Frankenstein, Bride Of Frankenstein, Dracula or any other from the golden age of cinema. It is truly creepy and sometimes uncomfortable to watch. It does not rely simply on thrills or special effects, but it's creepiness comes from the mental, emotional, physical and sexual torture that Mr. Hyde inflicts on Miriam Hopkins as Ivy. Which brings us to the next reason why it is the greatest. That would be Frederick March's performance and both the good doctor and his evil counterpart. There's a reason he won his first of two Oscar's for this picture. He is unrecognizable as Mr. Hyde, and it isn't because he lost in layers of make-up. He's simply a superb actor. His Hyde is so evil in his reveling in his new found sensual depravity that you find yourself sometimes squirming a little. And then there is his tortured Dr. Jekyll, trapped in his own experiment of good and evil. He is both heroic and immorally reckless in his ambition which makes you sympathize with him as you are repelled by his tampering with things best left alone. The transformation sequences are so astounding that for years no one not in the know could figure out how Jekyll turns into the deformed Hyde, since lapse photography was not used (like it was for The Wolf Man and every other werewolf in films). There were no noticeable overlaps of shots. Mamoulian used special colored filters on the lighting which when slid into place and hit March's make-up, created the change effect. Brilliant. This film makes you actually feel something, something that my other favorites don't )besides immense pleasure, thrills, amusement.) I can't recommend the 1932 Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde enough. It stands one notch above sentimental favorites like ""The Mummy"", ""The Invisible Man"", ""The Black Cat"" and the other classics mentioned above. A true horror film which gives us a real sense of human evil. It amazes me to think of Frederick March in this film and then ""Best Years Of Our Lives"". What range. The Spencer Tracy version is okay but can not touch this masterpiece.",1418860800,2,2339,4.735294117647059

Listen to the use of his voice and see his different movements such as when he enters the flat of Miriam Hopkins in a slow sinister gate. Granted some of the dialoque with the leading lady is of the 30's melodrama, but the contrast in the way he speaks to Hopkins as the pitiable pub courtesan is magnificent. Miriam Hopkins was convincing as Ivy and there is no question in my mind the acting transcended the mechanical and predictable acting of that era. I have seen the other Jeckyll and Hydes and though well done (Spencer Tracy and later Jack Palance) don't achieve the sheer evil of March's rendition. A well-deserved academy award for Mr. March.",1417737600,,827,4.557046979865772

These two films are included on the individual releases of their respective remakes, which are flipper discs. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the 1941 version of Jekyll and Hyde's menu didn't say ""1932 version on other side of disc,"" which is a lie, since 'Freaks' is on the flip side of the disc in this quadruple feature.

Likewise, Spencer Tracy's performance in DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (1941) suffered in comparison to that of Frederic March in the 1931 film; I find both actors satisfying on their own merits.  As for HOUSE OF WAX and THE HAUNTING, they are classic of the genre and taken as a whole I consider this DVD a must-have for any horror movie fan.",1412294400,,674,4.826086956521739

HYDE back in 2004 at the store BORDERS. Anyway this VHS was a reissue by Warner Home Video, but the VHS cover was a reprint from the 1989 MGM/UA Home Video cover before Turner Entertainment was bought by Warner Brothers. You might find the original used 1989 VHS tape of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (1932) with a sticker the tape saying MGM/UA Home Video, I can remember looking at the sticker saying 1932 Paramount Pubix Corporation. Renewed 1959 by Loew's Theater Inc. All Rights Reserved. The VHS version has a 1950s MGM logo instead of the 1930s A PARAMOUNT PICTURE logo, and some small scenes were cut due to the 1930s pre-code times or after MGM bought the rights from Paramount for a 1941 remake. You can compare the VHS and the DVD version of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (1932), because the DVD version is a restored film print with its original PARAMOUNT logo and the missing scenes are pasted back on to the film.

395237,4,630196781X,"First...I had this 2-DVD collection on my Amazon Wish List for a very long time.  I had expected to find it at a local retail Superstore, but no luck!  So once AMAZON reduced its price (to under $10), I knew I was going to buy these 4 films on 2 double-sided DVDs.

I hadn't seen HOUSE OF WAX since it was re-released in 3D to theatres during the late 90s.  But the intermission card 40 minutes into the movie caught me completely by surprise!  Anyway, the color and contrast were excellent along with the attempt to separate mono audio track into a Dolby format. Because I hadn't seen HOUSE OF WAX in such a long time, the character actors really stood out.  From Paul Picerni and Dabbs Greer to Frank Ferguson and Angela Clarke, I was amazed at the number of recognizable faces.  Naturally, Vincent Price was a standout.  The few extras included the theatrical trailer and a slightly tired looking Bela Lugosi escorting a man in an ape costume at the HOUSE OF WAX Premiere.

THE HAUNTING was one title I'd never seen before.  Based on Shirley Jackson's book: ""The Haunting of Hill House""...this black and white 1963 film was a curiosity.  4 principle players: Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson & Russ Tamblyn attempt to figure out why the house has claimed past family members along with total strangers. The fact that (the late) Robert Wise directed this film between ""West Side Story"" and ""Sound of Music"" proved that he could tackle an atmospheric chiller.  Extras include a commentary track from all 4 principal actors, Wise and Screenwriter, Nelson Gidding.

FREAKS is a one-of-a-kind horror film that was banned for a very long time.  But truthfully, the shock of seeing real-life deformed humans seems to have lost its punch.  Director Todd Browning took a lot of flack for the entire movie. [Cinema Historian, David J. Skal, provides the commentary track]. There's also 3 alternate endings along with a special prologue included on this DVD.

DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE is the last of the 4.  From what I remember, there was an issue about make-up? Spencer Tracy felt he could play both parts with just a little darker eyeshade and a Mr. Hyde scowl! This 1941 isn't a horror film or even a character study.  I'm not sure what was running through Director, Victor Fleming's head?  [It certainly wasn't as clever as his ""Wizard of Oz"" released 2 years earlier]. Once again...I enjoyed character actors: Donald Crisp, Ian Hunter, C Aubrey Smith and Barton MacLaine.  But Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner depicted as horses (in Jekyll's mind) was a little over the top!  Too bad there wasn't a commentary to spice this 'old chestnut' up? but the only extra was the Theatrical Trailer.

Overall...none of the 4 are particularly scary.  But if you enjoy playing movie trivia and trying to remember the name of that other movie a particular actor or actress was in---then buy the collection!",1346716800,2,2897,4.761523046092185
395238,5,630196781X,"I have just watched the TCM 4 pack and watched a film I have never heard of or seen. Freaks was produced in 1931  and is the most extraordinary of the four films . In all the reviews I have read the attention seems to be primarily on Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde. However after getting through the first ten minutes of freaks I for the first time in my 68 years, had a very intimate glimpse into the world of side show freaks and could feel for the first time the humanity of freaks who were billed in side show as non human. The selection of .many scenes really had the audience after the initial shock of seeing the freaks playing in the woods with a woman overseer. The way this woman felt the humanity of these freaks  brought the audience to stop  instantly and re examine their feeling toward these very disturbing looking people.  Prince Randy a self sufficient  and always gainfully employed  stars as the freak with no arms or legs  yet rolls his own cigarets and lights it. He lived to the ripe old age of 63  and performed  up to to and including the evening he died. Including siamese twins, legless , dwarfs the human skeleton, Johnny Eck half boy must be seen to be appreciated.
If you watch the entire film and all the special features provided which includes a lengthy interview of many and bio of the many  cast members of the film which provides many extraordinary stories of these people., you will want to watch it over and over. This is the best  film of the four pack and has been for me the most wonderful film experience in many years and it was produced in 1931.

This especially applies to people that don't know what it was like to watch television in B&W. This movie may help you to open your mind and change your way of thinking. This movie is surprisingly good. Keep in mind that acting back then tended to be a more dramatic than it is today. Even so, Frederich March delivers top notch performances as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. So good in fact that he won an academy award. The visual transformation into Mr Hyde is quite remarkable considering the era. Special effects were still in their infancy. There were no computer generated imaging that we have today. Just a lot of imagination and untested waters. As the viewer, you experience real empathy for the lives that are touched by both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It reminded me a bit of Jack and Rose from the Titanic. Two people that are perfect for each other but can never be. What was amazing to me was seeing Frederich March doing his own stunts as Mr Hyde, who could be quite acrobatic at times. All in all, a most enjoyable film and one I highly recommend!  PS: My other favorite film from the early 1930's you should check out is the original King Kong. No other version comes close.",1339113600,2,1307,4.445833333333334

395241,5,630196781X,"DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE

It's the classic example of good vs evil with a healthy dose of Freudian psychology in this theatrical retelling of a story about a man who invents an elixir which taps into the most base and primal parts of a man's soul.  This is perhaps one of the more shocking films in the early days of Hollywood with its frightening depiction of the maniacal Mr. Hyde, a figure so twisted he makes Dracula look like a saint and the wolfman a pleasant acquaintance.  It's a story with emotional buildup, fascinating violence, fearful dread, and some of the most genius special effects ever invented.

Most everyone knows the story.  The celebrated doctor Jekyll invents a concoction that drives to the root of man's most primal instincts.  Imagine combining vodka, steroids, cocaine, and a little red Bull, and you have your elixir.  The intent is purely scientific, as Dr. Jekyll hopes it will open the doors to man's beginnings and apply some insight to our origins.  Unfortunately he's in a somewhat sexually repressed relationship, and after an encounter with a very seductive prostitute, Jekyll decides to unleash his inner demons by drinking the elixir.  Once ingested, he becomes Mr. Hyde, the alter ego of Jekyll, the man Jekyll associates with freedom and pleasure.

All the best scenes of the movie are those with Mr. Hyde.  He's absolutely fascinating for so many reasons.  First and foremost is his appearance.  No other Mr. Hyde comes close to this one.  His makeup is closer to ape than man, with a hairline nearly to his brows, elongated canines, and a gait like that of a neurotic extra from Planet of the Apes.  In fact, Hyde resembles the old 19th century depictions of the classic criminal features, a man more beast than human.  And he acts the part too.  Hyde is everything Jekyll wishes he could be.  He exudes confidence, sexual allure, and if anybody even looks at him the wrong way, they will quickly regret the mistake.  The movie makes a great point of getting the viewer to sort of like he guy he's such a badass.

The sentiment evaporates rather quickly.  Hyde has his eye on the unlucky prostitute, Champagne Ivy, and he doesn't take no for an answer to his advances.  Hyde makes her his prisoner through frequent beatings and emotional abuse.  His sexual advances are forceful rather than consensual, and the slightest infraction of Hyde's rules is responded with torturous action.  Hyde is so repulsive you can't help but to hate him and the viewer feels for Ivy.  She is trapped by this brute, chained to him by threats of punishment and death.

This introduces real conflict for Dr. Jekyll when he comes to.  He's been having a grand old time as Mr. Hyde, but his rational self is shocked by his terrible behavior.  He vows to help Ivy and never drink the elixir again, but to his horror, he finds the change can now occur all on its own.  The beast is now unleashed at random, with horrific results.

While the movie is dominated by the Mr. Hyde scenes, the film is well constructed all around.  The transformation scenes are amazing and deserve enormous credit.  So too does the acting deserve recognition.  Fredric March does a fantastic job in the lead role, but equally amazing is Miriam Hopkins as Ivy.  She plays the frightened and tragic figure so convincingly you really feel pity for her situation.  The sets are great.  Particularly good is Ivy's neighborhood in the run down section of London with its crooked streets and tall, foreboding tenements.

There is some pretty heavy philosophy behind all the makeup, too.  The idea of this primal evil lurking just below the surface of the kind, educated, caring Dr. Jekyll, yearning for release, may be a little too true for the comfort of most people.  Few individuals care to play with the idea that they are just one step away from becoming a Mr. Hyde, and I'm sure Freud enjoyed the movie and its implications of the ever-active subconscious.  And unlike many movies, you won't find any happy endings here, just tragedy and sadness, all brought on by the puritanical values of a prudish father-in-law and the primal desires of a young scientist.",1326153600,2,4152,4.752447552447553

  That being said, there are still plenty of new film buffs just waiting to discover moviemaking magic like the efforts contained here; and since not everybody can afford to purchase a shiny, pristine copy of EVERYTHING...this is actually a fine introduction to 4 very different styles of horror filmmaking.
  Let's face it, on most single-disc or double-disc compilations, there's usually one dud amongst the treasure. Not here-the 1941 version of 'Dr Jekyll' pales in comparison to the 1932 masterpiece, but it's still a great piece of cinema. And how could it not be, with the wonderful Spencer Tracy digging his teeth into such a juicy role?
  House of Wax, from 1953, is also a remake-but unlike 'Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde', this version is every bit the equal of the original. You can thank the utterly fascinating Vincent Price for that, in a performance that doesn't allow you to take your eyes off of the '50's King of Horror'.
  Even better is Robert Wise's 'The Haunting', a truly disturbing, if dated, work that can be looked upon as a transitional film, bridging the more innocent Hammer and Giant Insect films of the 1950's to the psychological horror that would soon be shocking audiences throughout the '60's. (Of course, 'The Haunting' was preceded by Hitchcock's monumental, and superior, 'Psycho'). Be sure to stay far, far away from the '99 Michael Douglas/Catherine Zeta-Jones remake; that putrid effects-fest remains one of the worst films ever made that dared to call itself a 'ghost story'.
  Of course, the prize here is Browning's 'Freaks', a film that one simply MUST see in their teenage years, before ""jaded"" replaces ""wide-eyed"". This true classic so frightened British audiences when it was first made in 1933 that it was banned, shelved, and not seen again for decades. The director's use of genuine circus 'freaks' remains shocking and disturbing to this day.
  If your idea of great horror is the 'Friday the 13th' series, then feel free to spend your money elsewhere. But to those who appreciate the art of the psychological terror film, as well as those who have the ability to place an old piece of cinema in it's proper perspective, this great set gives you lots of chills for a less-than-scary price.",1308787200,3,2496,4.916666666666667
395323,5,630196781X,"This dvd is an excellent deal.  Ever since I was an avid child reader of Famous Monsters of Filmland, I had wanted to see the 1932 version of J&H but never could.  I poured over the pictures because Hyde looked like a combination of ape and werewolf, yet full of human malice, even what today I would label as lust.  The images mesmerized me, even the victim, who looked so different from the chaste versions of the Tracy film and others.  I now see that that was because she was frankly portrayed as a ""girl of the night"", before the censors required their blandness and genericized portraits.

Having finally seen the 32 version, I must say it was worth the wait.  March shows fabulous dexterity as an actor, morphing into Hyde and holding himself as in a complete transformation, in between human and animal.  It is the most believable transformation of any J&H film.  But there is a difference to this film, early as it was when talking films had just established themselves as mainstream, a rawness in which the voice of an auteur can clearly be heard; this is one of the things that attracts me to silent films:  you can perceive and feel that directors are creating an entire new medium, that they are experimenting as they go along, before the establishment of stock formulas and conventions.  I love this vitality of discovery and invention, which continues in this early talkie film.  To be sure, that can make them clunky or even slow, but at their best there can be a freshness to them that Hollywood has all but lost.  It helps that the ""standards"" of decency were not yet imposed, which made the naturalism of the portrayal of gutter London far more compelling in this film version.  The victim is obviously a prostitute.

Now, the 41 version offers a striking contrast:  the seamy side of London is idiotically toned down, even the ""bad girl"" (Ingrid Bergman) appears clean and almost perky, if flirtatious.  There is not a jot of honest sexuality to her.  Tracy is not a complete dud as J&H, but he walks through the role in a lifeless way, clearly just going through the motions as required by his studio contract; there is no vitality to him, nothing believable or genuine.  The directing is also rather indifferent, like it comes from a committee - feeling similar to the way that films are pasted together by marketing departments these days -  rather than from a director's mind.  As such, the film has little voice and is mere formula.

This is a great box set.  It could be used in film history classes to show what hollywood lost in the intervening period.  I am sure I will watch the 32 version many times, but not the 41.

395406,4,630196781X,"This is a review for the MGM DVD release of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, both versions.
The first version, from 1931 is on Side A and the second version, released in 1941, is on Side B of this double sided disc.

Both versions of this film are nicely done, the picture quality is fine and the sound is very good.  Special features include a commentary on the first version of Jekyll & Hyde as well as a Bugs Bunny cartoon satire on the film.  Side B contains a trailer for the 1941 version and both sides have optional subtitles in your choice of English, French or Spanish.

The 1931 version of DOCTOR JEKYL AND MR. HYDE was released by Paramount Pictures and directed by Rouben Mamoulian and stars Frederic March and Miriam Hopkins along with a fine cast of Paramount players.
Rouben Mamoulian kept his camera active and used shadows and light to unique advantage.
But central to this version of the Robert Louis Stevenson story is the performance of Frederic March, whose tour de force as both Jekyll and Hyde was supposedly quite shocking
for its time.  March used a fair amount of make up to transform himself from the smooth leading man to the rugged ape-like Mr. Hyde and it worked spectacularly.  It worked so well in fact that Frederic March tied Wallace Beery (THE CHAMP) for the Oscar for Best Actor of 1031.
This version of DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE is the superior one, in my opinion.

The second, probably more familiar version, occupies side two of this disc.
It was directed by Victor Fleming, one of MGM's highly skilled craftsmen who
seemed to be able to direct most anything including some of GONE WITH THE WIND and most
of THE WIZARD OF OZ.  This 1941 version of Dr. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE  stars Spencer Tracy, Lana Turner, Ingrid Bergman and Donald Crisp along with a virtual boatload of fine character actors.  The artistry involved in this version is almost palpable, the MGM gloss almost shimmers from the screen and the viewer is served notice that this is a quality production.
The performances by Spencer Tracy in the title roles are remarkable and he used not much make-up at all in his transformation from Jekyll to Hyde.  It looks like they rearranged his hair and eyebrows and Tracy used a scowl that was quite unfriendly looking.  In fact, the first time Jekyll morphs into Hyde, Tracy's visage  scowling from a mirror resembles James Whitmore blowing himself a Bronx cheer. Also, Tracy (or possibly a stuntman) exhibits an unexpected agility while being pursued by the constables. It's quite entertaining to watch him elude the law.
Lana Turner does a good, low key job as well but Ingrid Bergman is really very fine in this movie, the one she made  before CASABLANCA.
The main problem with this version of Jekyll and Hyde is that it is too long and a little too slow paced. As much as I enjoyed this version, the first version had a verve and
energy to it that this one lacks, unfortunately.

So I rate this double sided, two movie DVD 4 1/2 stars, 5 stars for the 1931 version and 4 stars for the 1941 version.  Both versions are good films and worth watching more than once.",1260921600,4,3105,4.5675675675675675
395536,3,630196781X,"This film, with a wealth of talent is directed brilliantly by Victor Fleming. A fine performance by Spenser Tracy in the lead role (as Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), makes this a worthwhile movie to watch in spite of the fact another version was made in 1932, with the lead player Fredric March was honored with an academy award in the best actor category. This movie is based on Robert Louis Stevenson's novella ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", first adapted as a play in the 1900s and filmed as a silent in 1920.

This story is about a physician named Henry Jekyll who incurs the ire of his older colleagues because of his experiments and views on separating the good and evil aspects of man's nature. Harry decides to take the serum, which he had invented himself and is briefly transformed into an evil alter ego named Mr. Hyde. When his fianc&eacute;e Beatrix Emery (Lana Turner), the daughter of Sir Charles Emery (Donald Crisp) is out of town, Harry turns into Hyde using his serum and goes to a music hall where he meets a barmaid named Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman); an attractive and sensual young woman whom he had rescued from an attacker few weeks ago. Later, Hyde manages to enslave her in a rented apartment. At the end of the movie everything goes wrong for Hyde as he kills Charles Emery and destroys property; the police will eventually catch him.

Lana Turner is charming, but Spenser Tracy and Ingrid Bergman have offered a fine performance in this horror movie appropriate for Halloween time viewing.

395537,4,630196781X,"When I saw that these two films were not available separately I initially was reluctant to review them at all, but then I decided that it might be kind of fun to give a collective review, comparing the two and pitting them against one another.  What is so remarkable about both features (released ten years apart) is that they really complete one another.  Separately neither film hits all the marks needed to make a great film, yet when paired together they create a complete vision of what this impressive tale could be seen as.

So, let's pick this apart a bit.

I think the most appropriate place to start would be with the actors portraying Jekyll and Hyde; Fredric March and Spencer Tracy.  Both takes on the character were very different from one another.  March had an almost regal take on Jekyll, yet his Hyde was a ferocious almost macabre creation.  Tracy made Jekyll very human, very relatable.  His Hyde, for me, was like Alfred Molina impersonating Jack Nicholson's interpretation of Fredric March.  It had this crazed almost campy personification that reminded me of Nicholson's `Joker'.  March's portrayal was much more `horrific' in that the macabre aspects added layers of complete insanity.  He reminded me of a character out of a 70's horror film, like one of the members of the grotesque family depicted in `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.  For me he gave the better (or more effective) Hyde, but Spencer Tracy just blew me away with his version of Dr. Jekyll.  The '41 version of `Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' is very much a film about Jekyll, and so the film really relies on Spencer's humanization of the doctor.  His take on Hyde doesn't bother me; it just isn't as terrifying as March's.

Still, if I had to choose a performance, I'd go with Tracy in a heartbeat.

Then we have the objects of Jekyll's (and Hyde's) affections.  In the '31 version these roles are tackled by Miriam Hopkins and Rose Hobart.  Hopkins delivers one of my all time favorite supporting female performances of all time, so we know who wins this one (in a cakewalk).  Her devilishly seductive qualities are only matched step by step by her gradual and realistic spiral towards fearful insanity.  She is utterly brilliant.  I also really adored Rose here, who captured Muriel's loving support yet fearful suspicion of her fiancs work.  The women of the '41 film don't fare as well.  Ingrid Bergman (one of my top ten favorite actresses of ALL TIME) is way out of her comfort zone here, and while she captures the seductiveness needed to carry the character of Ivy (and that close up shot of her teary-eyed face as she faces Hyde for the final time is just utterly gorgeous) she doesn't quite get a firm grasp of the entirety of the character, the full arc.  Her accent work is atrocious, and that takes away from the character development for me.  Lana Turner is effective, but an afterthought for me.  She works well, but she doesn't pop (and I love her work generally).  For me, the biggest standout in the supporting cast was Donald Crisp who just sizzles with commanding presence as Beatrix's father Charles.

So then we have the plot.  Both films are very similar in plot, yet the '41 film, for me, really expounds on the basic material.  The beginning especially sheds a lot of light on the man that is Dr. Jekyll.  Like I said, the '41 version is focused on Jekyll, and the '31 film is more about Hyde.  That is why the films need to be seen together to really appreciate them fully.  A lot of the center portions of the film are very similar to each other, but their strengths definitely lie in separate areas.  I can't really say which is better (I prefer the '41 for the mere fact that is fleshes out Jekyll so well) because they are so obviously focused in separate areas.

The direction is also very different for each film.  The '31 film is much darker in tone and construction.  The way in which film was made then (almost gritty and grainy by default) add layers of terror to the scenes, even those that are simply not meant to be fear-inducing.  The glossed over direction of the '41 version dampens the fear a tad, but it is much more beautiful to the eye (the use of fog mixes very well with the black and white, almost grey tone to the film).  Visually, the '41 film is more appealing and almost more easily appreciated, but I have to go with the '31 here, for it really captures a desired tone effortlessly and carries that tone without ever once losing it.

In the end, neither film is perfect.  Neither film would make my ballot for best of the year, but both films would litter my ballot in other areas.  Like I said, Miriam Hopkins is a revelation and would win my supporting actress award in '31, and her co-star Rose Hobart would get a nomination.  I'd also nominate it in Directing and a slew of technicals (if I really gave much thought to those races).  The '41 version would get three different major nominations from me, in supporting actor (for Crisp), lead actor (for Tracy) and adapted screenplay, for it definitely has a stronger screenplay in my opinion.

If I had to judge the films separately I would give the edge to the '41 vehicle mainly for the added depth to the screenplay, but both films have their strengths and weaknesses.  So, as far as my grade is concerned, I struggled with what to do.  Do I give the DVD an A, since when watched together the films complement each other in a way that creates a sense of completed vision, or do I grade the DVD based on the actual films involved and give it a B, since when viewed separately the films are incomplete?

As you can see, I went with my gut and gave my film grade, thus the four star review.",1258675200,,5682,4.546259842519685
395538,4,630196781X,"Everyone knows the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll is a scientist who believes each man has two sides, the good and the bad. He concocts a potion that brings out his brutish side, who he calls Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde then becomes uncontrollable, and a menace to Jekyll.

This is definitely a literary adaptation, so the action is slower than one might expect. Rouben Mamoulian created more of a legitimate production rather than a sensationalized Hollywood flick. As a result, the craftsmanship of the movie is superior. The transformation from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde is impressive, especially for 1932 before the days of computer animation. The photography is quite haunting too. The scenes of Dr. Jekyll escaping to his laboratory are very memorable, as is the grand finale where Mr. Hyde runs down the streets away from the angry mob as their shadows loom on the walls behind them.

However, not everything is exactly the same as the book, which is rather short.

There are also pre-code elements that fans of the genre will enjoy. Ivy is a prostitute after all, and references of her immorality and the things Hyde does to her are quite shocking.

395540,5,630196781X,"This review is primarily about Frederick March's 'Jekyll and Hyde'.  I've seen the Spencer Tracy version but, other than the wonderful young Ingrid Bergman, I find the March version far more interesting and disturbing.

March undergoes a number of hideous physicaal transformations as he degenerates into the ultimate, completely depraved Hyde persona.  Interestingly, in doing so, the producer/directors make a deliberate effort to take us backward in human evolution.  Hyde becomes not only psychologically bestial but, physically, he reverts to something like proto-Homo erectus.  This probably isn't fair to our ancestors.  They might have been a rough crowd but it is unlikely that they were evil and destructive in the 'Hyde' sense.  Otherwise the human race would have disappeared 600,000 years ago.

Also March, as Jekyll, is not a particularly sympathetic figure [at least I didn't find him sympathetic].  Yes, his initial transformation is more-or-less an accident and, later, the transformation comes over him although he wishes it otherwise.

But this simplistic viewing of it misses a major point.  Somewhere between his first dose and his subsequent uncontrollable changes, he apparently takes the pottion time and again.  Knowing that he will go back to sexually abuse, torture and humiliate Hopkins, as the dance hall girl, he takes the dose ANYWAY.  He enjoys being depraved and evil and his evil leads him to murder.

Fortunately, for the sake of London and the sake of the world, Hyde is shot dead.  Too bad the dance hall girl didn't think of that one, herself.

About the same time I was seeing this fascinating film, I watched Brando's 'Last Tango in Paris' and immediately noted the distinct similarity between the Hyde and the Brando character.  They are both sexual sadists and both deliberately abuse and humiliate a young girl.  The difference is, perhaps, in level of consent.  Intitially, at least, Brando's female victim is entirely complicit in her own degradation.  Slowly, gradually she comes to the realization that things have gone very wrong and she absolutely must escape.  In both cases...Hyde and Brando...the only escape is death.

The Hyde victim is less consensual but, initially, at least, her mistake is that she does, at a certain basic level, agree.  Rather than leave the dance hall with the bestial Hyde, she can kick, scream and make a commotion.  She doesn't.  She goes with him and, later, when she has some bare possibility of escape, she doesn't.  Both the Hyde and Branco victim are similiar indeed.

395541,4,630196781X,"Looking back from now, the 1941 version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" looks more like a psychological drama (or melodrama) with a love triangle in it than a horror movie. As far as I know, this MGM version has been, decent as it is, overshadowed by the 1931 Paramount adaptation starring Frederic March, which many rightly consider the best adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson novella.

Though Stevenson is credited as the writer of the original work, the 1941 adaptation is actually a remake of the 1931 version, which was based on the 19th century play adapted by T.R. Sullivan. The original's story about the strange experiments of the brilliant doctor Jekyll and its horrifying consequences basically remain the same, but the rest of the originally novella was considerably changed.

In the slow-paced MGM film, while Doctor Henry `Harry' Jekyll (Spencer Tracy) is engaged with lovely, pure-hearted Beatrix Emery (Lana Turner), his evil alter ego, sadistic Mr. Hyde dominates and abuses the barmaid Ivy Peterson (Ingrid Bergman). Director Victor Fleming attempts at making a tense psychological drama between Jekyll / Hyde and Ivy - the latter claims she cannot run away from Hyde, as if hypnotized) - and the direction works to some extent. The cinematography is impressive, using the contrast of light and shadow effectively. Still, though his acting is not bad, Spencer Tracy is not the best choice for the role and Lana Turner is not required to do much.

One thing is certain, however. Ingrid Bergman is surprisingly effective as the ill-fated barmaid Ivy. She looks gorgeous as a tempter, and then painful as a victim. Of course her role doesn't appear in the original novella, but surely she is the reason for us to watch this 1941 ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" Also, don't miss the film's bizarre ""hallucination"" sequences.",1251676800,,1832,5.019736842105263

The Fred March version of Robert L. Stevenson's classic is not only a well-run story, but is a classic presentation of film experimentation.

First person camera view is used a lot to great effect in this film.  Focusing on the eyes, face and expressions is fun to see as well as the fading between scenes, the two scenes going on at the same time, and makes for a much more interesting viewing experience.  1931 is not that far off from the silent movie era, so this is great to see.

Dr. Jekyll (pronounced Jee kel) has a huge house with servants and is a respected scientist.  He plays the organ and is in love with the general's daughter, Muriel.  He speaks before the University and states the theory that man's soul is of two: to vault the good and the bad 'will fulfill', but things don't work out as well as he thought.

He decides to experiment and makes the cocktail that changes him.  The transformation sequence is quite well done, with colored filters and make-up that is not too unnatural but it's clear March is enjoying the role.

He saves a prostitute from getting slammed.  She likes him a lot but being the good doc that he is, leaves her be.  But as Hyde, he makes a quick trip back to her place, tortures her and flays her within an inch of her life.

He changes a few times and the last time he swears it is the last time.  He prepares for his engagement dinner, but then the prostitute comes to him (in response to his sending her money for what pains his alter-ego gave her) and she is positively suicidal at the prospect of Hyde ever returning.

Jekyll swears Hyde will never return.  Unfortunately he did not bet on the fact that the transformation can occur involuntarily.  The change happens in the park when he witnesses a bird getting killed by a cat: ""Death, death!"".

Meantime the dinner party guests wonder what is keeping Jekyll as Mr. Hyde romps through the park to some devious destination.

This is the first horror film to win an Academy Award.  I can't wait to see the next remake as I hear that one's pretty good, too.

Frea ks (1932) was misunderstood at the time of its release, but is now highly regarded as a horror classic. Director Tod Browning really had a vacuum to fill after Lon Chaney's death ended their successful partnership. This film is an example of his finest work post-Chaney. It is about Hans, a little person in a circus attracted to a beautiful but evil woman who marries Hans for his money and plans to murder him. When the other circus ""frea ks"" find out about Hans' bride's plans, they extract a cruel but fitting revenge. This film is available in a more deluxe edition that includes commentary. Audiences were troubled by this one when it came out because people with actual disabilities were used rather than actors and actresses in makeup.

The Haunting (1963) is more effective in this version than in the 1999 version with all of the special effects. You actually never see anything in this film - you just hear the sounds and experience the horror of Julie Harris' character as she stays in a haunted house along with a group of people as part of an experiment framed by a psychiatrist.

House of Wax (1953) is a remake of a precode version of this same film made in 1933. This 1950's version has both advantages and disadvantages when compared to the precode version. The 1950's version has the advantage of Vincent Price as the mad sculptor and a very young Charles Bronson as his brutish assistant. However, the 1930's version had Glenda Farrell as the brassy newspaper woman trying to solve the case of a bunch of disappearances with Fay Wray as the damsel in distress that the mad doctor has his eye upon. The 1950's version has the damsel in distress as the female lead, with no equivalent to Glenda Farrell in sight.

It's no secret - I love the old ""monster"" movies. The older, the better. I've loved `em since I was a kid. When I was growing up, I couldn't wait for the old (even then) movies with Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff to be on the 4 o'clock movie, and I read magazines like Famous Monsters of Filmland. Even though I couldn't see the old silent classics (this was back in the stone age - before VHS and DVD), I knew all about Lon Chaney in films like London After Midnight and, yes, The Phantom of the Opera. Although these days, I've seen nearly all those I would consider classics, and even own a copy of most of them, I had never seen Frederic March's 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I've long been aware of this version and that March is, even now, the only actor to have won an Academy Award for Best Performance - for a role in a horror movie.

Imagine my pleasure when I found this double feature DVD and at such a reasonable price - both the 1931 (Frederic March) and the 1941 (Spencer Tracy) versions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

At that low of a price, I was expecting a poorer quality transfer of movie to disc, but this turned out not to be the case. In fact, this turns out to be a restored version of the movie, with about 14 minutes of cut scenes having been put back. The rest of the missing scenes are apparently lost for good; most involved censorship issues, as this movie was made when the infamous Production Code was taking hold of Hollywood.

The basic plot of this film, for those of you who have never seen any of the film versions, or read the book, tells the story of Dr. Jekyll (pronounced in this movie the correct way - JEE-kel - with a long e, rather than the more commonly heard jeck-ell), a kindly doctor who experiments with drugs in the hopes of isolating those impulses of good and evil, inherent in each man. The drug he develops releases his animal, evil side - Mr. Hyde - who becomes a hard drinking, woman chaser...and murderer. Jekyll becomes addicted to the drug, and is no longer able to control the violent and unstable Mr. Hyde.

Even though this movie was made only a short time after Tod Browning's Dracula and James Whale's Frankenstein - both considered classics, and rightly so - it is, in terms of performances and cinematography, head and shoulders above those two. Whereas the camera is almost completely static in the first two, as if rooted in cement, there is much fluidity of movement in J&H. This is seen from the start.

When the movie opens, we are Dr. Jekyll. The director, Rouben Mamoulian, made use of a ""subjective camera"" - a shot that simulates what the character is seeing - and for the first couple of minutes, we are Dr. J as he prepares to head out the door to give a lecture at the local hospital. And although no doubt mild by some of today's standards, there is a lot of sensuality in this movie - from the statuary and background artwork, to the ""provocative"" shots of bosoms and bare legs in scene where Ivy (Miriam Hopkins) tries to seduce Dr. J (Frederic March).

Unlike the most common interpretation taken when it comes to this story, Mamoulian did not see it as a story of good vs. evil, but rather of the conflict between the spiritual and the animal that exists in all of us. He did this through use of light and shadow, and by playing up the Jekyll's noble, humanitarian nature, at times making him almost Christ-like. Later, when Hyde makes his appearance, March plays him (and the make up emphasizes this) initially like wild, rambunctious hellion - not so much evil, and running wild - but over time, his behavior becomes more bestial, and this is shown in Walter Westmore's (of the famous Westmores of Hollywood ) make-up. Instead of monstrous, Hyde is shown as being almost simian.

From the commentary that comes with the movie: ""As a prototype for Hyde, he [Mamoulian] didn't take a monster, but our common ancestor - the Neanderthal Man. Mr. Hyde's not a monster, but a primeval man, closest to the earth, he said. When the transformation first takes place, Hyde is not the evil, but the animal in Jekyll."" Mamoulian saw Hyde as a young animal, released from the stifling manners of Victorian society. Initially, Hyde is ""a young animal, released from the stifling manners of the Victorian period."" In fact, Mamoulian wanted Hyde to initially be humorous and ""full of vim"" and shows this in such hi-jinks as showing him in a dance hall, copping a ""cheap feel"" of the exposed back of a woman as he walks past her, or tripping the waiter who was expecting a tip. Eventually, however, he progresses from the lack of inhibitions to become a hellish, woman-beating monster.

I was struck by the relationship between Hyde and Ivy, the dance hall girl. It is a hideous love/hate relationship, and exploits the bond that exists between an abuser and his abused.

""Forgive me,"" Hyde sneers at Ivy. ""I hurt you because I love you. I want you. What I want, I get. Under this exterior, you'll find a very flower of man.""

As much as I was impressed by March's portrayal of Jekyll/Hyde, I was equally if not more struck by Miriam Hopkins' portrayal of Ivy. The intensity of her performance in scenes with Hyde, when she is being terrorized (and eventually murdered) are amazing; while I knew all along that I was watching a movie, it was easy to believe that her emotions were genuine.

Also on this disc is the 1941 version which starred Spencer Tracy, and I learned why the earlier March version was all but non-existent for so many years. When MGM bought the rights to this story from Paramount (which made the '32 version), they also took all copies of the earlier version and locked them away. They didn't want it competing in any way with their newer, more lush production.",1246406400,,6299,4.553003533568905

395612,5,630196781X,"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde has been filmed since its March 7, 1908 release. The version staring Fredric March is one hour and thirty-six minutes and was released in theaters on December 31, 1931 and the version starring Spencer Tracy is one hour and fifty-three minutes and was release in theaters on August 12, 1941. The basically follow the same patterns. Dr. Jekyll wants to develop a potion that separates the bad soul from the good soul and in doing so creates the evil Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde makes Ivy Peterson his girl by force and later winds up killing her. Mr. Hyde confronts Dr. John Lanyon and Lanyon watches in horror as Mr. Hyde changes into his friend Dr. Henry Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll is unable to control the transformation and must brake off his engagement to Muriel Carew in the 1931 version and Bea Emery in the 1941 version. In conclusion Dr. John Lanyon shoots and kills Mr. Hyde and we watch on last time as Mr. Hyde transform into Dr. Henry Jekyll. There are major differences between the two movies.

In the opening scenes in the 1931 version Dr. Jekyll is playing the organ and his butler Poole is reminding him of his lecture. In the 1941 version it opens up during a church sermon and there is a heckler in the church. In the 1931 version Dr. Jekyll gives a lecture his students about the theory of good and bad souls and in the 1941 version, Dr. Jekyll tells his theory at a dinner party. It is also in the 1941 that Dr. Jekyll is seen conducting test on animals to prove his theory. No tests are done in the 1931 version. Fredric March's Mr. Hyde becomes more sinister and primate looking with each transformation. Spencer Tracy's Mr. Hyde had very little make-up to look evil and remained the same features with each transformation. In the 1931 movie Dr. Jekyll sends Poole with fifty pounds to give to Ivy Peterson or Pearson and in the 1941 a messenger boy delivers the money. Also in the 1931 film the movie was shot like a Victorian setting with most of the actors attempting to talk or act British like. In the 1941 version none of the key actors spoke or even tried to act British and even though the movie period was set in London, the movie played like it was set in the United States.

Overall Fredric March's Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde was much better filmed and acted and Spencer Tracy's Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde was just outright awful. Since Warner Brothers owns the rights to Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, the only way to buy the 1931 version is as a double feature. The five stars rating goes to the 1931 version only.

395613,4,630196781X,"Just as in ""Les Miserables"", Frederic March really was this young once. The avuncular actor of later films won't be found.  Here March portrays the split personality of both a kindly, idealistic London physician and the raging maniac he creates in his lab.  Dr. J was filmed in creepy black and white-that lost art.  The special effects are truly shivery as the good Jekyll transforms into the evil Hyde before the viewer's very eyes.  Director Mamoulian keeps the pace frantic as March morphs from Jekyll to Hyde and back. The female leads are central to the plot. Both Miriam Hopkins and Rose Hobart are superb. MH is the racy, ""pre Code"" bar girl who Jekyll befriends and Hyde abuses. An old ""Variety"" review claimed that Hopkins played her role with ""a capital sense of comedy and coquetry"".  She certainly had personality. RH is Hyde's proper upper class good girl.  Her dad, played by Halliwell Hobbes, notably smells a rat with Jekyll early on.  (According to the ""Video Hound's Golden Movie Retriever"" Ms. Hobart lived to the age of 92, dying in 2000). Hollywood, in the very early days of Academy Awards, noticed Dr. J. March won the Best Actor statuette but had to share it with Wallace Beery, ex post facto style.  DR. J was put forth for Best Adapted Screenplay. If Makeup awards were given back then, there surely would have been another nomination.  If Dr. J has any weak spots it lies in the decrease of dread each time March changes personalities. Also, Mamoulian may have had trouble with the coda.  The film could have ended sooner.  This reviewer made the same observation about ""The Mark of Zorro"" but these rants are minor. Dr. J represents classic early Hollywood, plain and simple.  There appear to be several restored DVD and restored VHS versions out there for viewers to enjoy.",1224892800,,1803,4.762057877813505

After a while, the habit became so ingrained that he became a brute without having to imbibe the chemical, ultimately destroying his sanity and his life.

395736,4,630196781X,"This DVD gives a worthwhile opportunity to the viewer to compare the  1932 Paramount version of the famous story with the more controversial 1941 MGM version. Both are excellent in their way. When the later film was made, MGM purchased the earlier version and promptly buried it. It is surprising how close the scripts of the 2 films are for they offer quite different interpretations: in the early version, Hyde's motivation is definitely sexual but in the later version, it is more  psychological.

In 1931, Rouben Mamoulian bought his visual flair and mobile camera to the still fledgling talkies and created a dynamic and generally exciting interpretation. Fredric March starred in an Academy Award winning performance. Mamoulian's vision was Hyde as a Neanderthal man, a prehistoric beast with basic desires. The makeup, which contributes enormously to the violence of March's performance, makes him unrecognisable so he really does play 2 distinct roles. As Jekyll, March is a bit wet and hammy but as Hyde, he lets loose and is memorable. His motivation is definitely sexual as Jekyll is frustrated in celibacy by waiting 8 months for his marriage to occur. Miriam Hopkins plays the guttersnipe on whom Hyde unleashes his rage and she is superb, a revelation to those who know her for her artificial overacting in so many other films. You really feel her terror. Jekyll's fiancee is played by the believable but dull Rose Hobart.

The 1941 version is a plush MGM product with Spencer Tracy in the lead. Tracy was uncomfortable with the role and his interpretation is more subtle than March and probably not as effective. His motivation is much more psychological, with more restrained makeup which makes Jekyll and Hyde more believable as 2 sides of the one person. This in fact may be closer to Robert Louis Stevenson's original concept. Ingrid Bergman plays the Hopkin's part but she is miscast as a Cockney. Her class shines through and while she is touching and luminous, she is never really believable. Lana Turner plays Jekyll's fiancee. She is baby faced with a pout and a giggle, great looking but completely unconvincing as the object of affection of the mature Tracy.

The 1931 version ran into major censorship issues both when it was in production and on its re-release and up to 14 minutes have been restored from the best available sources. The print is variable, sometimes crystal clear and other times grainy and dirty but at least the film is complete. Best of all, a first rate commentary has been included which really analyses the film with many direct quotes from the director. This is one of the best commentaries I have heard on a DVD and it covers, if briefly, the 1941 version as well as reference to John Barrymore's version from 1920. The 1941 print is almost perfect. Theatrical trailers for both films are also included.

The final bonus is the inclusion of a funny Bugs Bunny cartoon lampooning the famous story - Bugs at his best.",1194134400,,2968,4.89065606361829

The second entry has a gorgeous MGM gloss, and assured direction by Victor Fleming.

Dr. Jekyll speaks of the duality of man's nature, the good and the bad side which are always in conflict. If the bad side of man could be eliminated how much better for mankind? Are our beliefs crippling us? Does Dr. Jekyll spend too much time in the charity ward? His life seems just perfect. But his wedding is pushed back to a future date. A street quarrel attracts Dr. Jekyll, he helps a young woman, and she invites him back. Dr. Jekyll continues to experiment in his laboratory, he is obsessed with his theory. He experiments with the elixir on himself (no objective observer!). The effect is to free the bad side of his nature.

Dr. Jekyll has a setback in his plans, and his elixir transforms him into Mr. Hyde. He returns in search of that young woman. [The make-up of Hyde tells you something about the outlook of that time.] Hyde acts beastly, but his money makes him attractive to the young woman Ivy Pearson.

395742,4,630196781X,"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (DVD)

What Is It?

This is the monster movie classic from 1941. It has a cast of big stars that your kids (and maybe you) will not recognize. The ""Father of the Bride"" Spencer Tracy plays the good doctor and the monster that haunts Ingrid Bergman & Lana Turner. It was directed by Victor Flemming after his 1939 hits ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone With The Wind."" Shot in black and white, this film looks and sounds wonderful on the new ""re-release"" DVD that also includes the 1930's version.

How Was It?

This was a good film, but I think I would have been more impressed in 1941. The story was strong and interesting. Unfortunately the pacing of the film is just very slow.

Mr. Hyde becomes more ""monstrous"" as the film goes on. Each time he changes, it's uglier. This is a poetic choice, but at the beginning, it's hard to understand why Dr. Jekyll's friends don't see the amazing resemblance between him and Mr. Hyde.

Is It Good For Kids?

First of all, it is in Black and White. Most kids today have not been exposed to ""good"" black and white films, so most are turned off by it.

Secondly, it is still ""Very Slow.""

Finally, the issues are very heady. As ""Mr Hyde"", he has weird fantasies that are decidedly adult in there symbolism. Then it is a monster move with murder, ugly creators, and screaming women.

[...]
How about Spiritual Issues?

This is one of the most exciting parts of the film. The film starts in a church and ends with a Psalm being recited. Dr. Jekyll is trying to control the sin nature of the human soul with chemicals instead of God. (This is clearly stated at the beginning of the film.) When the Doctor realizes that he has an evil nature that he can not control, he dedicates all his time to breaking the bond in his soul to separate out his warring factions. The result is the personification of both halves. He names his evil side Hyde (or Flesh) and becomes him to indulge in sin. The sin starts at fantasies and watching ""daring"" shows, but then escalates to full consummation of evil. The problem of the soul is truly revealed when the Doctor decides to stop becoming Mr. Hyde, but then finds himself changing without the chemicals. He has not suppressed his evil, he has fed it, and now it is literally a Monster he can not control.

What Is Your Recommendation?

If you can get around the slowness of this picture, it is very interesting. Here we see that trying to live your life separate from God produces monsters, and the monsters may be us.

Otherwise, maybe it's time for a re-make... have you ever considered producing?",1156464000,4,2592,4.463983050847458
395743,4,630196781X,"I watched Fredric March in ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" last night and I was impressed by the quality of this 1931 movie.  From the opening scene that takes us from the perspective through the eyes of the main character and then transfers us via a mirror to the camera's perspective, I knew there was talent behind this production.  There were a number of other noteworthy scenes including some fantastic shadow imagery during a chase scene and the impressive on-screen transformation of Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde.  I looked up the director, Rouben Mamoulian, and discovered that he has some other noteworthy films to his credit.  They include ""Laura"", ""Blood and Sand"", and ""The Mark of Zorro"" but I confess, I hadn't heard of him before.  In addition to Mamoulian, a lot of credit goes to the Academy Award-winning preformance of Fredric March.  He does well playing the dual roles and giving each one its' own seperate characterization.

Frankly, I got more out of this version of ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" than any other version I'd seen.  I confess that I never read the book but I think I got the purpose of Robert Louis Steveson's novel.  Dr. Jekyll is focussed on the idealistic theory that, if we could but chemically seperate the good nature of man from his evil one, the society that would emerge would truly be heaven on Earth.  What we discover, along with Dr. Jekyll, is that man speaks of the greatness within but succumbs to the earthly obsessions.  The scene in which Jekyll is tempted by a loose woman (played quite ably by Miriam Hopkins) is quite provacative for 1931.  In being that provacative, Mamoulian captures our essence as well as Jekyll's and we spend the rest of the movie torn between sympathizing with and rebelling against the good Dr.'s negative transformations.

What kept this movie, for me, a notch below greatness, was the physical makeup of Mr. Hyde.  He was certainly hideous in appearance but his hair looked like some sort of bad joke.  If it was meant to convey the image of an ape, it succeeded.  However, the director had already reached us on a more personal level so I felt that the ape-like crown of Hyde's was contradictory to the message; we have our ugly side but it is still human in nature.  Perhaps a minor point but it distracted me every time Hyde emerged.

This movie was truly ahead of its' time.  It didn't scare me but it did make me think about a number of things.",1128556800,15,2420,4.625292740046838

The Audio Commentary is also an excellent feature, as it delivers a lot of fascinating information regarding both versions featured on this DVD as well as the John Barrymore version from the 1920's.  Now for the main features:

The 1930's version with Fredric March is highly entertaining, and although it certainly fits the mold of a ""creature feature,"" it carries with it an intelligence that distinguishes it from a typical monster flick.  Fredric March himself is excellent in the dual role of the saint-like (and eventually tortured) Dr. Jekyll and the initially humorous, but ultimately horrifically sadistic Mr. Hyde.  The ape-like Hyde make-up in this film is excellent, especially for its time, but the transformation sequence is even more impressive, as it is done fairly realistically.  Also, the film sticks to the basic storyline, and the use of the fiance/dancer dichotomy adds an interesting twist to the ""strange case.""  This is a must-see for all fans of horror movies, especially those who enjoy classic horror films.

The 1940's version of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde with Spencer Tracy is also a highly entertaining and excellent film.  There are those who do not consider this a horror film-- I would have to disagree with them completely.  Although this film is a rather lush production of the Jekyll/Hyde story, Spencer Tracy's Hyde ends up being rather horrific in his character, all because of an effective portrayal by a more-than-capable actor.  He (Tracy) manages to add a more humorous touch to both personalities (Jekyll and Hyde), and his Jekyll seems genuinely exhausted from the numerous misdeeds of his alter ego.  As for the Hyde make-up, it is considerably more human-looking than the Fredric March version, but this does not make it any less effective.  In keeping with the tradition of the 1930's version, Tracy's Hyde begins as a somewhat more brutish-looking man who bears relatively little resemblance to the actor, but gets increasingly hideous as the film progresses; as his deeds get worse and worse, this Mr. Hyde becomes exactly what he's meant to be: a monster, both in character and appearance.  True, Mr. Hyde may not be a typical role for actor Spencer Tracy, but his excellent performance shows that he is far from miscast.  Also, this version follows the basic story format as well, which qualifies it as a good adaptation of the original story.

It's actually based on the book by Robert Louis Stevenson and it shows a side between good and evil, good vs bad. This was filmed in 1937 and was directed by (I can't even describe it...I get it Roger Monmoulian or sumthin.) and this stars Fredric March as the lead role of this part playing 2 parts first is Jekyll and second is Mr. Hyde (Dr. Jekyll's heir).

It includes everybody from Holmes Herbert, Miriam Hopkins, Tempe Pigott, Edgar Norton, Rose Hobart, just to name a few. This won an Oscar for it for Best Actor and/or for best music score or sumthin. May have to do a lil' research on that as possible.

Ok as I was watching this movie I notice the different sides which Jekyll explain in this movie based on the Bible. The matter he's telling that there is a good side of a person or man and a bad side of a person or an evil man. Just like Jesus who is the Good Son of God and Satan aka the Lucifer is the Bad side of Evil of Dante. Can I explain more?

When Dr. Jekyll is being helped by his chauffer and butler Poole (played by Edgar Norton), I actually hear he plays the organ, didn't know that until now, he returns into his lab where he does an experiment in transformed into the evil of all which I told you who sends out to kill people or attack people or whatever is Mr. Hyde. Such a long story.

I'm happy I didn't had this at all. I'd been awaiting to own this since I borrow this at a Fulton County library back in '95 or '96 or sumthin. Hope I'll have this single on VHS and the dual versions of both Fredric and Spencer Tracy on there on DVD ASAP. Man these guys been gone for a long while but they definitely live on.

Rather, enjoy it as a fun look at the incredibly two-dimensional characters who (as in the novel) are driven by Stevenson's famed dichotomy of character.

  Unlike the novel, the 1932 movie introduces several changes-including a different point-of-view, many entirely new characters, and a surprise ending.  Likewise, little is left to the imagination (as Stevenson aimed) regarding Jekyll's baser half.  The theme shifts from one of sin to fidelity as Jekyll attempts to remain faithful to his fianc and deal with his intense (and somewhat artificial) desire for the flesh.  Without a doubt, my favorite aspect of the film is the (unintentional) portrayal of Hyde as a rather farcical character, aided by the cheesy cinematographic techniques.",1116288000,2,920,5.2534246575342465
395829,4,630196781X,"I enjoyed the 1932 version of the classic with Frederick March much better than the 1941 version (Spencer Tracy). The film, which is based on the Robert Louis Stevenson classic, serves to depict the duality of both good and evil in Man. Dr. Jekyll, who believes that all individuals possess both good and evil qualities, wants to prove to others that those two qualities can be separated.  He finds that he really has two lives, the good-natured and respectable Dr. Jekyll, and the evil and sinister Mr. Hyde. Before long, he has trouble separating the two, and Hyde begins to take over.

 As one reviewer noted, perhaps one of the more refreshing aspects of the 1932 version seems to capture is the essence of Hyde being a ""monster"" in not only physical form, but psychologically as well. Frederick March's portrayal depicts the sinister forces of want, as he leads the beautiful Ivy into a terrifying relationship. Tracy's Hyde does not capture this quite as well.

This is really an exceptional DVD in that that are two versions of this classic. There are also a few extras that make this a worthwhile buy.",1111276800,3,1109,4.760416666666667

March was known for light comedies (can you imagine Ben Stiller as 'Jekyll & Hyde' today?), and his being selected to play a ""horror role"" was unusual. But he pulls it off very well, in no small part due to the neanderthal-ish makeup he wears. Notice how as the story progresses, he gets uglier and uglier. The biggest problem with taking Stevenson's story and putting it on the big screen is the story's ending. Hyde commits suicide out of sight of everyone, locked in Jekyll's lab. Needless to say, this ending often gets chucked out the window (only time I've seen it end that way was in ""Mary Reilly""). I think to this day March is the only actor to get an Oscar for a horror role. Greg Mank's commentary is superb. I've met the man, and he is a true lover of the genre.

Spencer Tracey is one of my favorite actors. Let's just say he was miscast in the role here.",1110499200,,950,4.361581920903955
395831,5,630196781X,"In recent months, I have watched a lot of the old 1930s Universal monster movies.  Some are true classics, probably none more so than Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, the Mummy and the Invisible Man.  Many of the others are pretty good as well.  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, produced by rival studio Paramount, rivals the best of Universal, and may even be better.

The story is so familiar that Jekyll and Hyde have become part of our language.  Frederic March plays the good doctor who, in the pursuit of knowledge, isolated his dark side and soon loses control of it.  What makes this movie so good is that March's Hyde is genuinely monstrous in a way that the Universal monsters rarely approach.  It is little wonder that March won the Oscar for his performance.

The movie itself is almost flawless, with excellent direction and good effects.  There is also a good commentary track and as a bonus, a Bugs Bunny cartoon that offers its own take on Jekyll and Hyde.

The flip side of the DVD provides a remake of the movie.  It features big-name actors (Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner), a big-name director (Victor Fleming of Gone With The Wind fame) and lavish sets.  Yet with all this going for it, it is a dull movie, a lifeless version of the March version.

Nonetheless, this gets five start because of the older movie.  The other version is a high two star effort that only makes you appreciate the first movie more.

To today's generation of movie-goers: FORGET the recent ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""Van Helsing"". Dr. Jekyll was not so confused and Mr. Hyde was not the Sasquatchesque CGI lightshow that these flicks have palmed off to the movie-going public.

The 1931 version may be the ultimate film adaptation of R. L. Stevenson's novella. While liberties were taken with Stevenson's tale, the atmosphere and imagery make up for the differences. (According to the commentary, Stevenson's own niece wrote director Rouben Mamoulian a letter praising the film, regretting only that her uncle was not alive to see the film.) Fredric March well deserved the Academy-Award he won for the duelling egos. It is to March's credit that he does not phone-in the Jekyll performance and save the juice for Hyde. His Dr. Jekyll is a compassionate (and passionate) scientist/philanthropist whose vitality slowly disintegrates as ""Mr. Hyde"" overtakes him. March goes from a charming, vigorous gentleman to a trembling, tortured soul whose final good-bye to his fiance (Rose Hobart) is heartbreaking to watch. When he does change to Mr. Hyde, March again impresses, as he does not let the troglodytic makeup do the acting for him. His Mr. Hyde is a liberated, uninhibited creature - played from within - whose appetites and desires bring terrifying and tragic results. Both performances are tour-de-forces of nature.

The 1941 film does not fare as well, although it is a respectable version. Spencer Tracy is not in his element, although he performs decently. His Mr. Hyde is actually closer to Stevenson's version (having a raspy voice and displeasing smile.) It would have been interesting to see what Robert Donat - MGM's original choice - would have done with the two characters. While the 1931 film was a compact atmospheric frightfest, the 1941 film is an ""Illustrated Classics"" movie - sumptuous sets, high production values, and comely leading ladies (Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman), and is hampered by not being frightening. In spite of this, it is still well-worth seeing. (Trivia note: March himself liked Tracy's performance very much.)

Also on this disc are the hilarious Bugs Bunny short ""Hyde and Hare,"" a commentary to the 1931 film, and the trailer for the 1941 film.

395833,4,630196781X,"Adapted more from the 19th century stage play than Robert Louis Stevenson's novella, ""Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" play very differently with strikingly different results. Both are marvelous in their own individual way. Rouben Mamoulian's classic 1932 film features a stunning performance from Frederic March as Dr. Jekyll. March plays Jekyll in the 1932 film and Spencer Tracy plays the same role in the 1941 version. In both Jekyll discovers an elixir that unleases the animal within. This alternate personality takes the name of Mr. Hyde and commits all the violent crimes that Jekyll might want to do but wouldn't including murder.

The use of filters in front of the camera to do a continuous take for much of the transformation was a brilliant idea. As each filter was removed more of the make up is revealed. Although the final bit of transformation doesn't occur this way it makes Mamoulian's film more convincing than many others from the time that editing for the transformations. Tracy's transformation is much more dependent on his abilties as an actor and less on the make up. Both actors give solid performances in their respective films but March's (which won an Academy Award)certainly is the more reflective and powerful of the two particularly when it comes to becoming Hyde.

March's film is about the lumbering, primative beast within while Spencer Tracy's performance focuses much more on the psychological changes vs. physical ones that occur to Jekyll when he becomes Hyde. The Tiffany studio MGM provides a nice budget, exceptional production design and name actors for their film version. While Tracy does an admirable job as Jekyll his much more subtle take on Hyde doesn't work as well as March's on screen. Evidently Tracy's take on the character was that the potion could be no more than a placebo--all it does is give Jekyll permission to strip away the veneer of civiliation that hides the monster within. Neither Ivy nor the fiance were in the original novel (that I can recall)but their introduction actually adds considerable drama and gives the character Jekyll clearer movitations for many of his actions.

The cinematography for both films is exceptional given the era they were made in. The original negatives for both films are long gone (they were shot on nitrate stock which shrinks and falls apart after a couple of decades). The prints used here are about the best that can be found (much of the issues with the 1932 version mentioned in another review, i.e., how the version shown on PBS looked superior to the DVD version has more to do with the unforgiving clarity of DVD than anything else. The 1932 film does have quite a few analog defects due to the passage of time and the condition of the print this version was drawn from as well. Likewise, the 1941 film although it looks sharper than the 1932 film. The sound for the 1932 film has a bit more presence than the videotape version (it may have been compressed a bit more to make it sound louder)but it has the inherent flaws of any of the early talkies. The 1941 film sounds better with less flaws.

The commentary track film historian Greg Mank is both informative and rich with background on the time the film was made, the actors, the studio and the difficulties that Ramoulian ran into during production (including the fact that the studio insisted on someone other than Fredric March). We also get a classic Looney Tunes cartoon that fits the double bill perfectly.

The Films are very similar structurally, but in terms of delivery, March is more visceral, and Tracey is very polished.

Both films are scarey, and the contrast to the more recent depictions in the League, and Van Helsing is stark, but importantly shows that the myth of this dichotomy serves a purpose defined by its context, and is not limited by people's  lack of imagination ... the fact that it serves different purposes in different hands shows the power of myths. In fact, the films, if watched from a cultural context point of view, says more about the 1930s and 1940s milieu .",1099353600,,628,4.63963963963964
395835,5,630196781X,"This double feature gives you two of the best versions of Jekyll and Hyde. Although it's the same story the versions are very different. Frederic March's Dr. Jekyll is a high strung genius. He's impatient with his elders and with his future father in law in particular. Although it was made in the 30s the movie makes it clear in a tasteful way that Dr. Jekyll is going nuts from sexual frustration. When his fiancee goes on vacation with her father our hero spends his days and nights brooding in surly silence. It gets so bad that his butler tells him to go out and blow off some of his steam. Jekyll decides that now would be the perfect time to try that potion he's been working on and bam---out comes Hyde, a violent, mean and ugly creature. He's also going nuts from pent up desires but unlike Jekyll he goes out and does something about it. Miriam Hopkins plays Ivy, the dance hall girl and again although the movie never shows it, it's obvious that Hyde is thouroughly enjoying himself doing things to poor terrified Ivy that Jekyll would never dream of doing with pure, innocent Muriel.

The Frederic March version is a morality play. Jekyll wants to be a rebel but lets Hyde do the dirty work. Eventually Hyde is too strong for him and to save lives and what's left of his soul Jekyll is left with one card to play. It's a brilliant film.

The second movie on this double header is less successful. Spencer Tracy was a great actor but he's miscast here. His Dr. Jekyll is old enough to know better. He seems too sensible to do something as impulsive as coming up with the potion. His Hyde was closer to the book--Robert Louis Stevenson described Hyde as looking normal. He frightened people but not at first glance. The Tracy version is okay and has a few terrific scenes but the March version is the real reason to buy this video.",1098921600,,1841,4.459940652818991
395889,4,630196781X,"The biggest difference between this film version of Dr. Jekyll and the book is that in the movie Dr. Jekyll is a SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED scientist bent on unlocking the secrets of man's unconscious. Whereas the book explores man's dark side and the lack of religious faith in one (Jekyll) the movie paints a picture of Victorian society's sexual standards. An example is when Poole, seeing his master upset, begs him to go out to a place for gentleman's and ""amuse himself"". Hyde refuses, saying he is not that type of gentleman.

Yes, Jekyll does discover the serum and take it... but he does not take it a second time until his fiancee turns down his offer to marry immediately and leaves with her father for a two month vacation to Bath. Distraught, Jekyll runs to his lab, drinks his serum and then runs off to find the prostitute that proposistions him earlier in the film.

This movie put Fredric March on the map and for good reason. He plays his dual character with gusto, and his transformation into Hyde is amazingly hideous and ahead of its time. Miriam Hopkins is Hyde's pitiful love interest, but the sexual tension between her and the few scenes she has with Jekyll is thick enough to cut with a butter knife.

Completly engrossing, it's the best adaption of Jekyll/Hyde to date.",1098921600,3,1289,4.669603524229075
395890,5,630196781X,"Fredric March earned an Academy Award for his bifurcated performance in the titular roles of the 1931 version--arguably the best to date--of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, Robert Louis Stevenson's familiar tale of a scientist who uses chemistry to liberate his baser instincts and allow them free reign over his body and behavior.  And the Oscar was certainly deserved, as March easily convinces the audience that he is two different and disparate men.  As the academic Dr. Jekyll, March is prim and decorous, the epitome of Victorian English gentility.  But as the mean and selfish Mr. Hyde, March really cuts it loose and chews the scenery.  Part of the transformation can be attributed to the make-up, of course, which makes March look like a snaggletoothed hybrid of simian and Neanderthal.  But the make-up alone would not suffice.  It is March's brash delivery of dialogue, unusual gesticulations and posturing, and bizarre body language that really sells the unrestrained, vile nature of Jekyll's alter ego.
Another outstanding performance in the film is that of Miriam Hopkins.  In the role of prostitute Ivy Pearson, both the object of Mr. Hyde's carnal desires and the victim of his sadistic abuse, the amply bosomed and nicely figured Ms. Hopkins can exude a lustful sexiness while simultaneously being personable enough to elicit genuine sympathy from the audience.
The direction and cinematography work is also outstanding and contributes greatly to the film's success.  Director Rouben Mamoulian keeps the pacing brisk and the story tight, never allowing the audience an opportunity to become distracted or bored.  When appropriate, several shots are set up so that the audience literally sees the action from Fredric March's point of view--or at least the camera is skillfully manipulated to make it appear as such--and talented cinematographer Karl Struss is able to frame these shots in such a way that they are natural to the flow of the plot and never feel gimmicky or contrived.
Now, the DVD from Warner Home Video would be worth the retail price for the 1931 edition of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE alone.  But this is a double feature, folks, and Warner gives the paying public a second good film for the price of one ticket--MGM's 1941 version of the classic horror story.
In the 1941 film, Spencer Tracy assumes the two titular roles, and the beautiful Ingrid Bergman takes over the part of the prostitute Ivy.  Other than the change of cast and some filmic or narrative ""cosmetic"" differences, the plot remains intrinsically the same. This film's budget was much larger than the 1931 flick, though, and it also has big-name, high-profile stars in the major roles. Yet despite those assets, this film doesn't quite achieve the pinnacle of the first.
The film's major weakness is the palpable miscasting of Tracy and Bergman.  Both are fine actors, but Tracy's emotional range and Bergman's general persona make each really unsuitable for the characters they portray.  Tracy just isn't able to cut loose to the same degree as March, and he is therefore unable to create a Mr. Hyde that reads as the unequivocal polar opposite of his Dr. Jekyll.  As for Ms. Bergman, she's just too classy--on screen and off--for any audience to totally accept her as a woman of ill repute.  And while she's certainly as pretty as her predecessor in this role, Ms. Bergman's performing style emanates a sense of continence that makes her Ivy seem celibate, especially when compared to the lusty sensuality that radiates from Ms. Hopkins' characterization.
Still, the 1941 version is a pretty good flick in its own right, and it even has a few outstanding moments.  One of the best is a dream sequence where Ivy and Dr. Jekyll's betrothed--played by Lana Turner, who probably would be more believable than Bergman in the Ivy role--are transformed into centaur-like horses, with Mr. Hyde riding on their backs and wildly flailing at them with a whip.
In addition to the two films, the Warner double-feature DVD also contains a few cool bonus features.  With the better of the two films (i.e., the 1931 version), there is an optional audio track that offers a feature commentary with film historian Greg Mank.  Also included on the disc is a classic Looney Tunes cartoon called HYDE AND HARE, in which Bugs Bunny crosses paths with Dr. Jekyll and, in more ways than one, experiences the effects of the good Doc's elixir.
All in all this is a great double-feature offered at a reasonable price, and lovers of great cinema or fans of the horror genre will undoubtedly be pleased with having this disc in their film collections.",1084924800,4,4616,4.9572538860103625

It's filled with scratches, grain and the version I taped ten years ago from PBS is far superior. While this version is still fascinating to watch, you begin to ask questions. Why did the director plaster March with so much make-up BEFORE the transformation? He wears weird black lipstick and eyeshadow in his normal stages. When he does transfer, he becomes so ape like you have to wonder why everyone didn't run for the hills when they saw him coming? Which is why I found it hard to believe Ivy would spend one second with him--much less becoming his mistress. Still, this is the best version of them all and one hopes that one day a restored, cleaned up version will be available on DVD.",1082505600,,826,4.550335570469799
395892,5,630196781X,"This is a two-sided DVD that contains two versions of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic.  As many other reviewers here have said, the 1932 Frederick March version is far superior to the 1941 Spencer Tracy version.  The older version, directed by a 34-year-old Rouben Mamoulian, is a masterpiece and part of movie history.  The later version, directed by Gone With the Wind and Wizard of Oz director Victor Fleming, seems like an uninspired copy of the earlier one.  Frederick March understood the role and seemed to revel in it.  But, oddly, while he overacts a bit as Jeykyll, he seems totally believable as the monstrous Hyde.  Tracy seemed uncomfortable with both personalities, playing Jekyll as too much of a saint and Hyde as too much of a leering sadist.  March conveys the personality of Hyde as joyfully enervated by the full release of Jeykll's baser instincts. His Hyde has fun with his own badness.  Tracy's just drowns in it.
 The special effects in the older version are also superior, and there is lyrical Freudian symbolism in the sets, statues, paintings, etc, that really adds to the drama and continually reminds us of Mamoulian's power as a visual director.  The newer version attempts some symbolism (for example, the two whipped horses transform into the two leading ladies) but its symbolism is so heavy handed that it makes the earlier film seem profoundly subtle by comparison.
Even the makeup in the older version is superior.  In the Tracy version, Mr. Hyde's appearance seems inconsistent from cut to cut within the same scene.  And the use of a masked double for Tracy, even in non-stunt scenes in the London fog, is painfully obvious. You don't even need to pause the DVD to see it.
The earlier version is so technically dazzling, it's hard to believe it was filmed only a couple of years after the silent Lon Chaney classic, Phantom of the Opera.  I've never seen an early 30's film that looked so crisp and sounded so good.  And no review of this version should leave out the excellent and sexy performance of Miriam Hopkins.  She's convincing as a love-starved hooker and even more convincing as the terrified victim of a depraved client.  In many ways, her performance seems less theatrical, and therefore more contemporary, than March's.
The Greg Mank commentary on the 1932 version is entertaining and informative, in a gossipy as well as scholarly style.  Through his commentary, you find out things about the film and crew that really do add to your insight and enjoyment of the film. There is no commentary on the 1941 version, but Mank does disciss it a little (in too forgiving a way, I think) near the close of the 1932 version.  Overall, I think this is a great collector's DVD, and will be one of the most treasured in my collection.",1076198400,98,2778,4.788259958071279

Not only do you get two films on one disc but there is an excellect commentary track as well as a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I find the 1932 version the better of the two.  Not only are the special effects better but so are the acting and pacing.  For example, early in the 1932 film Dr. Jekyll makes his ideas known in a dramatic speech to a group of university professors. The 1941 film has Dr. Jekyll making his comments over a dinner conversation, it doesn't hold the viewers interest as well as the older film.  Also, the makeup of the 1932 film turns Mr. Hyde uglier after each transformation.  This helps to emphasize his more horrible behavior as the film goes on.  The makeup on the final transformation is so extreme that, according to the commentary, March had to be hospitalized in order to prevent his face from being scarred for life.  The older film also makes good use of several scenes with split screens.

March is outstanding as J/H--his transformation and sinister/goofy portrayal of an apeish Hyde is great acting.  This movie is worth watching if only for Miriam Hopkins.  Think of her as a pre-code Cameron Diaz.  She certainly seduced me. One of the most disturbing things about this film is the violence of Hyde with respect to the Hopkin's character. It's scary and seriously creepy.",1075334400,2,495,4.927710843373494
395895,4,630196781X,"As one who never misses an opportunity to add a Spencer Tracy film to my collection, I must admit that I am a bit prejudice because of my view that he is, perhaps, the finest American actor of the 1940-1960 era.  But, unlike the other reviewers I much preferred the Tracy version of the story.  First, while some of the technical flaws of the Frederick March version may be due to film degradation, it is also clear that sound recording in the 1932 version was far more primitive, something you'll especially notice in scenes where there is movement across a large set.  By 1941, not only had the sound recording improved substantially, but the visual aspect of film had also evolved.
But, my preference for the later Tracy version goes beyond that.  To me the more subtle characterization of Hyde by Tracy captures the reality of the evil side of real people.  March's transformation is excessive, more like one would expect from a horror movie, while Tracy seems to be saying that the average man is not grossly different at his best or worst, that it takes little to tip the scales.  In particular, the final scene with Lana Turner, you know he is transforming from lover to murderer without ever seeing his face.
It's remarkable how very similar the scripts are for both versions, so I suggest watching them in chronological order.  While I prefer the Tracy version, I appreciated the opportunity to see and compare the two.  And, BTW, you will notice that it would seem more logical for the female leads in the Tracy version to be reversed, but both Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman turn in fine performances, as opposed to Miriam Hopkins (1932) whose performance is a bit over the top.",1075248000,5,1689,4.6824324324324325
395896,4,630196781X,"I just finished watching these two old favorites on this dvd and I concur with the earlier comments.  I've never seen the '32 version looking so gorgeous!  The '41 version always was a top example of MGM gloss and still is. Filmmakers from the beginning - there's a 1911 version on dvd now - realized that RL Stevenson's story could never be faithfully told as he wrote it.  Why?  Because he wrote a mystery: what is this relationship between Jekyll and Hyde? He does a great job of letting readers imagine a sordid relationship between the two men - blackmail or sex?  The surprise ending that the two men were one and the same became too well known to be faithfully depicted. Instead, filmmakers turned the story into a cat and mouse game with the viewer as a de facto accomplice of J/H.
That said, these two sound film versions take different approaches to the story and it's really a case of comparing apples to oranges to say one is better than the other. I think that Stevenson himself would have preferred the 1941 version if only because it captured the staid Victorian mindset of the British upper class that he depicted in his novel. Likewise, Spencer Tracy's characterization of Hyde as a master rather than a monster of psychological torture is a great idea. Not necessarily better, but an interesting alternate approach. Fredric March knew he was walking in John Barrymore's footsteps from the 1920 version so his monstrous appearance was probably a given under the circumstances.
One last point worth mentioning: Both versions have a major gap in logic in the final scene. We understand why Hyde would seek to escape the consequences of his murdering two people, but when Jekyll is restored in the final scene, how strange that he continues the cover up, refusing Dr. Lanyon's request to tell the police the truth. If you think about it, this action is totally at odds with Jekyll's character. The problem was addresed better in Barrymore's 1920 version: before Hyde takes over again, Jekyll swallows poison to stop Hyde's further atrocities. Good man, that Henry Jekyll!",1075248000,2,2085,4.812849162011173
395897,4,630196781X,"Robert Lewis Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" is basically a Victorian morality tale, about the power and predisposition of mankind for either good or evil.  When scientist Henry Jekyll attempts to separate the good from the evil he discovers that the evil is too strong for him and thereafter runs amuck in London as the demonic Mr. Hyde. This DVD contains the two best versions of this film, the all-star glossy 1941 treatment from MGM and the vastly superior, pre-code 1931 Paramount edition starring Fredric March. Directed by Roubin Mamoulian, March's interpretation of Hyde is a tour de force. The transformation sequences - where Jekyll becomes Hyde - are terrifyingly realistic, while the death of bar maid, Ivy (Mirium Hopkins in 1931)is absolutely chilling. True, this version lacks the polish and sheen that MGM brought to the '41 version - but the '31 scares the very soul out of you - and that's all one really should expect from a horror classic. I would like to add that there's nothing inherently bad about the Spencer Tracy version, though the code of ethics by this time prevented this version from indulging in the shock and thrills of its predecessor.
TRANSFER: The one disappointment on this DVD is that the 1931 version of ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" was not digitally cleaned up. Age related artifacts including scratches, chips, tears and sometimes excessive film grain are present throughout the entire feature. They distract somewhat from the presentation of the film. In contrast, the 1941 Spencer Tracy version presents a near pristine looking print of the film.  Both versions offer a solid, well balanced gray scale of the B&W picture and both are free from digital anomalies.  The audio for both is mono but nicely cleaned up.
EXTRAS: The '31 version comes with an audio commentary that is thorough, not just on the production of this version, but also comments on the silent John Barrymore and Tracy versions. This is a historically dense audio track that film buffs will relish. There's also a Bugs Bunny cartoon and the 1941 theatrical trailer - which is really tacky!!!

Fredric March towers here in both roles, and the entire production drips with the furious invention of early, pre-Code cinema.  This DVD version reinstates much (then) shocking stuff, including partial nudity and some violence.

This, to me, is the best. Not only is March's Hyde a hideous monster but the carnality between Jekyll/Hyde and the Cockney bar wench Champagne Ivy (Miriam Hopkins) is more explicit. This was Pre-Code Hollywood. Rather faithful to Stevenson's story, the film is brilliantly cast and directed. The atmosphere of 1800's London is thick with Victorian attitudes on one end and soaked with sex and sin on the other. It is between these two worlds that Dr. Henry Jekyll finds himself torn after experimenting with mind (and personality) altering drugs that bring out the bestial Mr. Hyde. The transformation scenes are well done for 1931. London's tawdry side of town is where Hyde seeks out the lustful Ivy and takes her forcibly as his mistress. Jekyll had already met her while ""slumming"" with a friend. Her image stuck with him as her bare garter-clad leg dangled seductively in his mind while her voice purred, ""You'll come back, won't you?"" But it's Hyde who goes back and dooms the helpless Ivy to a life of hell. In one of the scarier moments, Hyde hisses at the terrified Ivy ""I'll show you what horror is!"" And proceeds to do so. March deserved the Oscar for his masterful portrayal of the dual personality that is Jekyll/Hyde and Hopkins is perfect as Ivy. Rose Hobart is Jekyll's wealthy fiancee and the rest of the cast is grand. The classic organ score adds the right creepiness and morbid tone for this beautiful b&w melodrama. A welcome addition to DVD and a collector's dream, 1931's ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" is a horror classic and not to be missed by afficianados.",1068336000,66,1829,4.865384615384615
395961,4,630196781X,"As an English teacher, and lover of old films, I would have to say that this version of Dr. J. is exceptional.  I have reviewed several versions, and this one (while certainly deviating from the original text) is by far the best.  Fredric March gives a stunning performance, and the effects are excellent for the time period.
The 1941 version, as an example, shows a lack of imagination. This film simply modifies the 1932 film and actually is much worse in its adaptation and effects.  The ""Hyde"" in this film is nowhere near as menacing and terrifying as March's monster.
Overall, the acting is first rate (again, considering the time period).  The film captures Jekyll's struggle with his evil nature and his dual identity in a way that captivates kids in 2003 as well as I'm sure it did in 1932.  Students can see the ideas Stevenson tried to relate through his text come to life on the screen, as well as discuss how Hollywood's adaptations effect the written text. While I doubt R.L.

395962,4,630196781X,"This is arguably the best version of Jekyll & Hyde there is and ever will be! I liked the 1920 version with John Barrymore (I didn't care much for Spencer Tracy's 1941 portrayal), but Fredric March definitely takes the cake here, turning in a brilliantly over-the-top performance in the dual characters; especially as Mr. Hyde, where he is ruthless and menacing in sharp contrast to the comedic roles he was known for. It's hard to believe that March played BOTH characters; you have to look very closely, because otherwise you'll think it were two different actors; but as the main review said, March's performance is so good in this film, he more than deserved the Oscar he won for it in 1932!
On a rather humorous note, there's something I noticed in the film completely by accident: check out some of the facial shots of March in his Mr. Hyde makeup...the expressions he makes (especially when he cracks a smile through the bad teeth) make him look like Austin Powers!  Did Mike Myers get the inspiration for Powers by watching this movie?  It's possible...you be the judge!",1036540800,6,1078,4.759358288770054
395963,5,630196781X,"It's stirring enough for me, whether it moves Poole or not. Poole is as ""impregnable as Gibraltar. Even Bach can't move"" him.
But Poole isn't as unmoveable as all that. In the end he is the only one who can mourn for the fallen Jekyll.
I've watched this so many times this year and it's still interesting. Just last night I heard a line that I never heard before. ""It's the things one can't do that always tempt me,"" Jekyll tells Lanyon early in the film. From the very beginning, then, we should be aware of his deep-rooted discontentment and longing for the forbidden. This is really the key line to the whole story. It took me six or more viewings to notice it. I hope, reading this, you'll notice it sooner.
This is really a good story, with a perfect cast and wonderful filming. Ivy particularly is very good at playing a scared, hysterical, or alluring woman as the script calls. She is much more realistic when with Hyde than Muriel ever is with Jekyll.
For example, Jekyll tells Muriel, ""Now, my darling - chide me, mock me, hate me - but don't send me away!"" And later on: ""We shall go to Devon for our honeymoon. And live on love, and strawberries, and moonlight - endless moonlight!""
And Muriel always responds accordingly: ""Yes, dahling, with all my heart!""
But Hyde and Ivy are a different story. They are much more natural together, even if Hyde is a beast - in that there are fewer melodramatic speeches and more real acting. Ivy has to act terrified in many different ways, while Muriel doesn't have to do much but sit and talk sweetly to her beloved Jekyll - although her devotion is touching.
I would say the best scene with Jekyll and Muriel is when he comes to set her free. Freddie did a wonderful job playing the tormented, distressed man who can't explain his reasons for letting her go. ""Yes, Muriel, I was hanging out with another woman and I just choked her to death. So I think we'd better part ways, baby."" He truly feels terrible for what he has done. He couldn't bear to hurt her so he tells her nothing. He has come so low he doesn't even dare to touch her. But she still loves him, and when he strides away Robert Browning style, she collapses to the piano with a dramatic clash of bass notes.
A bit about Hyde the beast. He is really gross and that's an understatement. He gets progressively worse as it goes along. For a long time I couldn't believe it was really him under that makeup, but now after having seen many of his movies, I no longer think that Humphrey Bogart dubbed Hyde's voice. If you listen carefully you can hear Fredric March's accents and inflections coming through, especially when he stops growling for a minute and talks almost like a normal person. I think the teeth were the strongest impediment to his speech - and to his kissing Ivy.
Lanyon is quite good as well. He seems to be sweet on Muriel. He calls her by her first name, is always there for dinner even if Jekyll is not, and has the general approval of Muriel's father because he is always punctual. And for some unknown reason, he turns up at the Carew's on Hyde's last night out. I like the scene when he gives Jekyll's lab-in-a-box to Hyde and watches bug-eyed as Hyde transforms back to Jekyll.
I should speak of the book here as well and the other version with Spencer Tracy. I have to say this is one example of a movie that is better than the book, for the very simple reason that there is more in the movie - more story, more depth - than there is in the book. The book is good, but the addition of the women in the movie makes the tragedy of the book twice as strong. As for the Spencer Tracy version, it's completely inferior, without any of the depth or artisticness of this earlier version. Ingrid Bergman may have played Ivy well, but she couldn't change the fact that Tracy was the lead, and I think the main problem lay in his being miscast. A priest he could be, yes. Katherine Hepburn's long-suffering husband, yes. But anything else - not really.
There is also a book called The House on the Strand by Daphne du Maurier about a scientist delving into the unknown with a drug and his best friend as a guinea-pig. Reading it lately I could see several similarities with the story of Jekyll and Hyde, as far as the chemical yuk itself was concerned and how the people ultimately reacted to it.
But back to the movie. It is more than a horror story - it's a tragedy of how a man so loved and respected for his kindness and devotion to his work can fall so low. It's not just about a monster, prowling around tossing little girls into rivers or turning vestal virgins into mummies. It's a story that is very real and moving, because it's full of strong characters to make Jekyll a very desparate character indeed. I can feel sympathy and pity for him even after all he has done. As he said in his confession-scene, ""This I did not intend. I saw a light, but I did not see where it was leading. I have gone farther than man should go.""
This is an excellent movie and you must see it....",1031097600,3,5015,4.370449678800856
395964,3,630196781X,"In the horror films of the 30s and 40s, a common thread was often the question of the limits of knowledge.  Was there truly an area that man was supposed to not go?  The novel DR. JEKYLL AND MR HYDE and the various filmed versions have each attempted to answer, however imperfectly, that question.  The 1941 version with Spencer Tracy as Dr. Jekyll sidesteps this issue, instead focusing on the consequences of splitting a human into his good and evil selves.  Director Victor Fleming sets up the eventual fall of Mr. Hyde by stages.  He uses both the dreariness of fogged London streets and the considerable talents of Spencer Tracy to suggest a noble but flawed Henry Jekyll.  The dark corners of the twisting avenues surrounding Jekyll's house suggest a lurking evil.  The smiling earnest face of Henry Jekyll suggests a similar unsettling moment as he contemplates that all men have within themselves a duality of morality that can be brought out by man's technology and science.  The two female leads, Lana Turner as Jekyll's fiancee and Ingrid Bergman as Hyde's forced paramour, are seen as reduced female images of Jekyll-Hyde. Turner is the pure Jekyll--loving, caring, endlessly forgiving.  Bergman is the rougher, more edgy version of Turner.  Various critics have been harsh in their condemnation of these two women, both in the characters portrayed and the acting involved.  Yet, these actresses' performances are exactly right. Turner's innate goodness is associated with Jekyll; each supports the other even when family and circumstance dictate otherwise. Bergman's acting role requires more subtlety.  Her beauty allied with her working class image is what attracts Hyde in the first place, but she has to shed her edginess each time she and Hyde interact.  The dramatic center of the movie is Jekyll, rather than Hyde.  It is he who gives form and substance to a plot that allows him to branch off to become the monstrous Hyde.  All of Hyde's evil is more a reflection of what Jekyll could have done rather than what Hyde did.  Spencer Tracy shows a Jekyll that needs his dormant Hyde to make life's difficult decisions.  Before his first transformation, Jekyll lived a life that was normal, yet bland. It was only after his exposing to himself of his Hyde personality, that his Jekyll side was able to become more confident.  When Hyde is killed by bullets, of course Jekyll too dies, but the death of both is more than the closing of a police blotter of crimes now solved.  Hyde's death indicates that Jekyll's goodness was incomplete without a recognition of the dark side that has existed deep within all humans since the apple eating incident of the Garden of Eden. DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE points out that undirected good needs directed evil to avoid plucking that apple from the tree in the first place.",1027814400,16,2823,4.880503144654088
395965,3,630196781X,"I remember the night well. I had read a story about Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde at the age of seven or eight and knew it was a horror story. So when I saw it was going to be on TV I pleaded with my dad to let me watch it. He did and I did. My first ever horror movie, so it has a kind of special place in my heart.
Spencer Tracy plays the infamous London doctor. My goodness, if I were as dull and uncharismatic as Tracy, I'd want to change into another person too. As it happens, he comes across a chemical potion that allows him to do exactly that-and so he metamorphosizes into an evil brute who looks uncannily like you would expect President Nixon to look first thing in the morning (these days, anyway). At least as Hyde he gets to be a bit nasty with a few people, which more than makes up for the inane dialogue the cast are forced to deliver.
Amongst Hyde's most abominable traits are his tendency to violence and his rather rude habit of spitting grape pips out onto the carpet (by far his worst offence-ask any housewife). Also of concern is the way his face wobbles about and blurs every time he metamorphosizes. He should really see a doctor about that, or at least get a better guy to do his special effects. Corny SFX have always been the downfall of the worst villians history has offered us.
The amateur freudian psychology of the dream/transformation sequences is an amusing diversion, and the sight of a naked Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner down on all fours being whipped by Spencer Tracy is a sight you will never forget (one wonders what was going through the director's mind). Oh, and anyone who has ever been to London will immediately recognize all those shadowy alleyways, narrow streets and thick fog, and will be familiar with the everyday sight of cloaked villians running across London Bridge pursued by bobbies whose thick accents betray their East London/Irish/Australian/South African/Yankee origins.
To be fair, this is kind of a fun film, and in between the banal chat there are some memorable moments where the photography, direction, editing and music suddenly combine with great style. The bedroom scenes with Ingrid Bergman (don't get excited-nothing too racy) are fascinatingly photographed, the camera rarely seeming to notice anything other than her beauty ('the camera was in love with her' I guess some camp film critic might say). The pace picks up considerably in the last half an hour, so it just about qualifies as a 'horror' despite the fact that the only thing horrific about the other three quarters of the film is Spencer Tracy's coiffure.
Perhaps it is just the nostalgic memory of staying up late to watch my first horror flick that renders the film worthy of three stars (for gosh' sake, Dad could have shown me DUMBO and it would have held the same appeal as long as I THOUGHT I was watching a horror movie). Maybe something in there will hook you too.",999993600,7,2902,4.582692307692308
395966,3,630196781X,"I found this version disappointing.  It's as though Robert Louis Stevenson's short story was turned into a novel by somebody other than him. In other words, I was left wondering whether the director ever read the story.
First, one of the great things about the story is Stevenson's description of London.  A dark, Victorian, setting, generates a mood that helps create the drama.  In this production, mood is practically nonexistent.
Second, Hyde assaulting a young child on the sidewalk helps define Hyde's brand of evil early in the story. That scene does not appear in this movie, leaving the audience guessing at his character.
Third, as others have noted, the women were miscast and Bergman's British accent made me wince.
But the greatest flaw is the change, or rather, the betrayal of the ending. Stevenson's ending dramatizes Jekyl's despair over what he's unleashed - an increasingly important theme as the story progresses. This production ignores that entirely.
While a director should not feel bound by an author's every word, they should honor the spirit of the original, particularly when the original ranks as one of the best of its genre.  Here, there are a few dramnatic moments but, in general, it's a two dimensional movie that does a disservice to a great story.
I give this 3 stars because of the cast, not because of the production.",995760000,5,1354,4.951541850220265
395967,3,630196781X,"This version from Victor Fleming, the director of The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Gone with the Wind (1939), was made only nine years after what is still recognized as Rouben Mamoulian's definitive version, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1931) - a relatively short time period for a remake. This version was made at the height of the 1940s vogue in Freudian psychology. But instead of opening the story up the Freudian interpretation ends up completely embalming it. Instead of a fight between civilized man and his animal nature the story has taken on the view that evil does not exist, merely insanity - a potentially intriguing interpretation. But the Freudian emphasis ends up being rather laughable - like the dream visions during the transformation with Spencer Tracy whipping a carriage with one white and one black horse, or the rude crude sexual symbolism represented by the one virtuous and one loose girl, and images of the girls seen superimposed swimming in the bottle as he is tempted to take the potion again. It is often stated that Tracy played the Hyde part without makeup as a contribution to the more psychological interpretation - such is not the case, he does use makeup - however he may well have. Tracy plays the part more as a slavering Scotsman - rather than representing man's baser nature, his Hyde comes across more as a malicious prankster. All one ends up being struck by is the patent theatricality of the performance, rather than any threat it should hold. Although there is one good scene with Tracy at a piano spitting out grape pips and forcing a terrified Ingrid Bergman to sing for him.
A better director could have made something out of it but Fleming directs this as though it were a big-budget musical. Any potential atmosphere is wrung out of the film it by the production design - the film is lavish but entirely stagebound, the streets of the West End are empty and bare of any lived-in quality. Fleming's handling is quite clumsy - the pace deadly slow. The crucial transformation sequence is entirely without impact - just a closeup on the bottles and liquids being poured and facial lap dissolves, all to canned music, no sound effects. It should have been the film's dramatic climax. The entire film is a good example of misguided effort. Everything appears to have gone wrong. The casting of Ingrid Bergman as the Cockney tramp and Lana Turner as the virtuous fiancee is disastrous. Both were cast in the other's role but decided to swap because they were tired of being typecast. It is probably the only bad performance Bergman ever gave. Halfway through the Cockney cheekiness gets forgotten and Bergman returns to something more introverted and passive, the type of role she should have been cast in in the first place. On the other hand Lana Turner is totally miscast as the fiancee, perpetually looking as though she wants to drag the good Jekyll away for some less reputable fun.

395968,4,630196781X,"Fredric March stars as the infamous Dr. Jekyll, the compassionate, forward thinking physician whose experiment with separating the dual natures of Man ends in tragedy.  Jekyll believes Man has both a good and bad sides to his nature, and Jekyll's bad side takes the form of Mr. Hyde, a brutal, repulsive thug who destroys the life of Ivy, a ""girl from the wrong side of town,"" who unfortuantely crosses paths with him. March is excellent in this role, especially as Mr. Hyde.  He's almost unrecognizable in his transformation, and he plays both characters with a lot of style.  Miriam Hopkins, never a subtle actress, digs into the role of Ivy and makes her sympathetic, sexy, and very memorable.  Director Reuben Mamoulian experiments with camera angles in this early talkie, and although some of the close-ups aren't successful, the film never drags or fails to entertain.  I've never read the novel to be able to state whether the film is faithful to the text, but the movie could hardly detract from it.  It's very good drama/horror.",981072000,5,1037,4.897142857142857
