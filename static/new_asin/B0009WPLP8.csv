8068605,4,B0009WPLP8,"There are 2 films on this set that aren't on other sets that make this a must have for me. ""God told me to"" is a fantastic surreal cult scifi gem I had wanted to see for ages, and did not disappoint, and ""Unhinged"" one of the ""video nasty's"" banned in the UK for years, a bizarre little independent slasher from 82. Cathy's Curse is a great creepy flick as well. The prints are actually pretty good in this set, for the minimal investment I'm really pleased to have these films in my collection.",1369526400,,495,4.276595744680851
8068606,3,B0009WPLP8,"Highlights of this collection are a cult favorite that's set at an abandoned amusement park, a star-studded made-for-TV fright film and a journey into the seamy underbelly of the big city.

""Carnival of Souls"" grows in stature with each passing year. Candace Hilligoss is perfectly cast as a woman detached from humanity after the car she was riding in plunges off a bridge into a river, and she emerges as the lone survivor.

""Death at Love House"" has the restrictions of 1970s network TV working against it, in spite of an outstanding cast. In this one, a young man is possessed by the spirit of a dead movie queen-- a woman who once had an affair with his father.

""God Told Me To"" has a Catholic police detective investigating murders he believes are related to the occult underworld in NYC.
