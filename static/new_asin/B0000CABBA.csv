7998556,4,B0000CABBA,"I purchased and viewed the version of El Bruto with the cover depicted (Cozumel Classic Films  yellow banner at the top of the DVD description). While it doesnt state anywhere on the DVD cover or on the DVD Menu, this version comes with easily-readable English subtitles. The subtitles automatically play. Thank you to the previous reviewer for indicating as such.

This film, while not a classic, is a worthy watch for fans of Luis Buuel or cinephiles. This film is a product of Buuels Mexican period, where he was forced to film low-budget films for a general Mexican audience for the money. The plot and dialogue are well-written and the acting more than passable. The main theme of the film is a common one of the repression of the poor by the rich with the aid of their hoodwinked poor minions. But as typical for Buuel, he does not romanticize the poor.

 Wow...What an intense and enthralling film. Pedro Armendariz, Katy Jurado and Andres Soler are exquisite. Directed most artfully by the great Luis Bunuel, these immense talents combine to completely absorb you in this dark drama.

 From 1952, it's a film that has aged well: An unfeeling landlord is going to evict the poor residents of his property in order to sell the land at a huge profit. He's got the law and the courts on his side, but the process is easier said then done. He comes up against some tough opposition when the tenants refuse to move and stand up to him under the leadership of four of the most outspoken and brave men of the group. Frustrated by the tenant's stand and loyalty to each other, his beautiful wife, who has a very dark side, advises him to get rid of the four instigators. Not being a young man, he turns to El Bruto. A guy who although not the smartest of the bunch, has a physical presence that is quite intimidating. And what's more he has been loyal to the landlord, his mentor since childhood. El Bruto takes matters into his own hands and the result is tragic. Complications get even deeper when El Bruto falls deeply in love with one of the tenants daughters, but has already given in to the seductive powers the landlord's wife. She is a woman scorned and is out for blood.

 I would liken it to ""On the Waterfront"", in the way that pits the powerful against the weak, the relationship of El Brute and the girl, the character study - that may have you wondering just exactly who is ""The Brute"" in this film -  and as the film builds on the emotions of all concerned and gets more intense as the story unfolds.

 This black and white film is in Spanish with English subtitles(no option to turn off). The DVD transfer is clean and clear. You will barely notice it's age. The only extra is a filmography of Pedro Armendariz.

 A fine film and a definite keeper. Katy Jurado, always a joy to watch, turns in a fiery must see perfomance for fans. Armendariz presents an huge and powerful portrayal. Together, under the superb filming of Luis Bunuel they are electrifying, making this a cinematic treasure.

 The film has language and adult themes.

7998561,4,B0000CABBA,"Had Luis Bunuel ever made a bad movie? I've seen fourteen his films and every one of them is great, simply fantastic, starting with the most famous short film, 17 minutes long ""Un chien andalou"" (1929) and ending with his swan song, ""That obscure object of desire"" (1977). Bunuel made films in France, his native Spain, and in Mexico where he had to immigrate after Franco came to power in Spain. Each of his films is uniquely brilliant but all of them have in common his magic touch no matter what period of his life they belong.

""El Bruto"" is no exception and it is a strong combination of a surreal melodrama and political film which could also be viewed as a modern retelling of the Frankenstein's story. Pedro ""El Bruto"" is a young tough slaughterhouse laborer who is exploited by a tyrannical landowner who may be his father and to whom he is very loyal. He is eager to help Don Andres to evict the poor tenants form their houses that belong to Don Andres. Pedro is a simple man who was not used to think a lot and analyze the motivations of the others but he will learn and his eyes will open. Pedro will become a not so obscure object of desire of two women, passionate and strong-willed Paloma, the young wife of Don Andres and the kind and gentle Meche, whose father Pedro accidentally kills while doing the job for Don Andres. As is supposed to be in the melodrama, one of the women is scorned and hell hath no fury as she does and the inevitable ending is coming. The very last shot of the movie with its enigmatic irony is pure Bunuel - only he would finish the film the way he did.

(NOTE for the fans: Rialto is releasing into theatres 'The Phantom Of Liberty' & 'The Milky Way'. So Criterion will most likely be releasing these two by next year at the latest.)
Contrary to the information found on most websites, this DVD release DOES have English subtitles. As far as accuracy in the translation - it's passable. Being a Spanish-speaking person I took some notice of the differences. But how often is the spoken word in foreign film treated with the proper justice through the subtitles?
'El Bruto' is a must-see for those who appreciated Los Olvidados and the like. Speaking of which, 'Los Olvidados' with 'Las Hurdes (Land Without Bread)', as well as 'El (This Strange Passion)' with 'The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De La Cruz' HAVE ALSO been released! And these are NTSC Region 0 DVD's. For more information, check with DVD Beaver's reviews on the aformentioned titles.",1082073600,21,979,5.012269938650307
