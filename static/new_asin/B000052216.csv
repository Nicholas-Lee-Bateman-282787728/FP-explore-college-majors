7929696,5,B000052216,"I purchased this item after seeing a action clips of this great film. It as the style of Quentin Tarantino with the story of standby me. This Korean gangster movie isn't just all action, but as a good story behind it. It starts off when a childhood friend gets murdered in a back ally. All his friends and family meets up at the funeral after many years. Two of them a brother of the victim and one of his best friend decide to go find the person who killed him. They go around questioning every street punk in the city. The two encounter and take on all sorts of fights no matter the size. Threw most of the movie the two are out numbered, but there heart and lust for revenge helps them overcome all that stand in there way. I choose to buy this movie because of one clip, thinking it would be an average fighting movie, but the movie was much better than I dare dreamed... A must have for all.",1176508800,,896,4.184971098265896
7929697,1,B000052216,"This video promotes racial stereotypes.  It is full of foul language.  Every other word is ""m-f'in"" and ""m-f'er.""  Shows an extreme skew of very violent, racist, sexist picture.  Does not include what normal domestic violence really is.  Easy to dismiss it as this depicts the extreme.  However, do need to give them credit for having the courage to deal with this topic and make a stand against it.  It might be good in dealing with inner-city gang-banger or wanna-bes.",1088553600,5,470,4.8734177215189876
7929698,5,B000052216,"This is a very well writen and acted video.  You have to take into consideration the budget the RZA was working with this when making the video.  He didn't have millions to blow.  The cast was solid and featured many of the Killah Beez which before this weren't well known or reconized.  The jail scene was ill, as was the into part with the newspaper articles.  I give this entire film credit and all the videos are good (includes ""The Night The Earth Cried"" by The Gravediggaz, which was also directed by The RZA).",1070755200,,516,4.446808510638298
7929699,3,B000052216,The tape is alright. THe movie is really short. I thought it would be longer than that. The videos are kool at the end. Its a good tape for a wu collector like myself. Adios,1001289600,2,173,3.9714285714285715
7929700,3,B000052216,"...I had to get this because I'm wu to the fullest.  I do have to admitt thought that I was a bit disappointed, because the back of the video says ""approx running time= 1 hour"", not even close.  The whole ""domestic violence"" short film was no more than 16 minutes long, but at the end of it there are like 4 or 5 music videos which really make up for such a short timed film.  It does say in the cover ""a short film by the rza"" but I wasn't expecting it to be this short.  Anyway it is worth the buy because all of the actors in the movie are wu killa bees and the videos are rare and dope.  It be better if this was on DVd, I hate tapes but oh well, you'll live through it.  Cop this piece if you are a true wu fan.",1000425600,2,716,3.771812080536913
