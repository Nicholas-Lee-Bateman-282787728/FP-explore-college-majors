8305822,3,B001GKTD5G,"This is basic WWII documentary material and is pretty interesting if you are trying to understand this part of the war.  My own father was wounded in the Philippines on Luzon on the Cagayan trail,  He was seriously wounded and survived until 1997.  What I don't understand is the seller's claim that it is ""racist.""  The war ended, the Japanese lost and that is how it was.  Perhaps he would have been happier if more Americans had been killed?  Most wars have some ""racial"" issue involved.  This was true in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.  The people we were fighting were racially different from most Americans.  This, however, was not the reason we wound up fighting them although it might have been the reason they wound up fighting us.  They made a big mistake if they did, that's all I can say.  This guy needs to keep the social comments out of selling DVDs on Amazon.",1375315200,,882,4.589743589743589
