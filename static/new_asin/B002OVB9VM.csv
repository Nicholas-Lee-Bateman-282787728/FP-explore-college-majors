8376419,3,B002OVB9VM,"The title ""Power Aerobics Ski Fitness"" is pretty misleading.  This is a low budget production--though not unpleasant--featuring one woman in nature doing exercises.

The actual title of the DVD when you pop it in is ""Ski Gymnastics,"" and has German and English language options.

Run time of the DVD is 38 minutes.  There are several short segments.  The active part has you marching in place in between spates of ski twists and leg strengtheners.  I would say at least half of the video is floor exercises, though.  These are all fine exercises, which would certainly strengthen the lower body muscles used in skiing, and the woman in the video is nice to watch (not annoying), so I guess this is a good purchase if that's what you want.

From the title, I was picturing a room full of would-be skiiers jumping and pumping and sweating in a long cardio workout: just be aware that this does not happen on this DVD.",1370563200,3,915,4.6397515527950315
