8590296,3,B00D78DX3I,"This is apparently the pilot film for the unsuccessful 2011 TV series. The action takes place in Houston at Ray Ray's used car sales and normally on a Thursday. The plot consists of episodes that have little to no connection to each other. Ray Ray (Sherman Hemsley) owns the dealership. Ritchie (Carl Anthony Payne II) is a problem salesman whose troubles are compounded when they hire a new guy (Clayton Thomas).

The writing is failed TV series trite. It has some mildly humorous segments, but needed some good knock-out lines. There is some implied sex behind closed doors as well as some token legs and cleavage shots.

Not offensive, but not really funny either.",1383350400,,667,4.842105263157895
