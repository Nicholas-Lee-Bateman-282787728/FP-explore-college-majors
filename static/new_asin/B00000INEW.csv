1224564,5,B00000INEW,This video is excellent.  It combines the wonderful music of Mozart with fun toys and pictures.  I can see how much my 6 month old daughter loves this video and gets excited when I put in on.  She has been watching it for  over a month now and never tires of seeing it over and over.  I'm even  entertained by it and have favorite parts!,926553600,,337,4.107692307692307

1224601,5,B00000INEW,Our son LOVES the Baby Einstein videos. He will watch one while we do other things around the house- he laughs at the screen and enjoys the images and music. It's been a miracle product for us. He's been watching this video almost daily from pretty much birth to 8 months (so far) and he's still entertained by it. It's a great product.,1416787200,,336,4.349206349206349

1224619,5,B00000INEW,My toddler adores to watch this over and over she never gets bored of it,1404864000,,72,3.8666666666666667
1224620,5,B00000INEW,"Both my grandkids adored this so I scared up the Bach and Beethoven ones. My 13 month old laughs and is mesmerized and calm watching it. Great pre-nap background to her bottle before her AM nap. Great job on all, but the Mozart is the best. Disney took it over and maybe that is why the cost went up and the quality got better. They removed the repeat option if you are trying to calm a little one down. Once my 13 month old falls asleep in my arms, I switch to real Mozart CDs and she sleeps 1-2 hours and wakes happy and cheerful. She is an angel anyway, but I think this helps. Bought some of the items they use on the DVD, but beware, they can be pricy.",1403654400,,657,4.022900763358779

1224643,4,B00000INEW,"My daughter absolutely loves the Baby Neptune which is a level 2 and when I bought Baby Mozart I did not realize it was a level 1, so it does not keep her attention so much unless she is tired and the music relaxes her.  I know she would have loved it had I purchased this when she was younger.  Baby Einstein products as a whole are great!!",1399507200,,341,4.0
1224644,5,B00000INEW,Our child us obsessed with Baby Einstein & this was the first DVD we bought for her. She watched it over & over and started to laugh & get excited. Perfect for a parent who has to get some cleaning done!,1396224000,,203,3.975609756097561
1224645,4,B00000INEW,I give this a 4-star because my Granddaughter isn't as interested in this DVD as the Neptune's Oceans one. There are a lot of toys used as the means of entertainment.,1390953600,,166,4.387096774193548
1224646,2,B00000INEW,"My son liked the music when it started but the visuals were just too simple for a 12 month old. There are geometric and textural images that rotate for each song and he liked the bright colors at first but after 3 minutes, he turned his back and played with his toys while he listened. I ended up returning it. Might be for younger kids.",1390176000,,337,4.2
1224647,4,B00000INEW,"I got this video for my autistic sister Michaela for Christmas. She loves it. She's 14 and still watches Baby Einstein.

  I'm going to list some pros and cons about this video:

Pros:

Great for interacting with her because there is one sequence in the video where this spinning thing comes up and she says, ""It's a toy!""

Has music she likes (Mozart)

Cons:

Lacks education

It's VHS and it will degrade over time

I'm glad Michaela liked it!",1389830400,,445,4.518987341772152
1224648,5,B00000INEW,"I think every mom or dad should get their children baby Einstein dvds.  My daughter was mesmerized by this and you could tell she was learning by watching. It is a great distraction to keep you young one entertained, especially for a single parent.  When I needed to cook dinner I would put this, or other baby Einstein dvds on and it would keep her entertained.  She loved it!",1389657600,,377,4.434782608695652
1224649,4,B00000INEW,"Haven't observed grandson watching this one but other 2 Baby Einstein DVD's where hits,
expect this one to be also.",1389484800,,115,4.8
1224650,1,B00000INEW,"When my wife suggested this Baby Einstein series, I said no way--no way am I wasting my hard-earned dollar on that gimmicky crap.  And no way is listening to Mozart on a xylophone gonna turn our kid into some kind of super-genius.  Boy was I wrong.

It started slowly.  First, my wife noticed an increase in her sight words.  Next, the nanny said she was talking in complete sentences.  Then I started seeing it.  I'll never forget the first time she said, ""May I have my nubbie?""  ""May I"".  Like she's from England.  I thought it was cute.

But from there, it got completely out of hand.  I used to do this thing with her, where I held my hands up to my face, then took them down again, and she'd giggle.  The last time she laughed at me was when I mispronounced ""restaurateur"".

I used to read to her, to help put her down.  Five minutes of Green Eggs & Ham and she was out like a light.  Now it's two hour of Kierkegaard, followed by questions--questions I can't answer.  What do I know about the ""infinite qualitative distinction between man and God""?  I'm a broker!

The other day, I take her to the playground, and I forget her juice box.  Big deal, right?  ""Waa waa waa,"" she goes--she's three.  I say ""I'll make it up to you.""  ""With interest,"" she says.  ""Fine,"" I say.  Next thing you know, she's built an abacus out of Cheerios and I apparently I owe her a crate of Sunny D!
I drew the line.  I told her ""No.""
""Why not?"" she says.
""Cuz I'm your father,"" I say.  ""It's the principle.""
She says, ""No, dumb-dumb--it's the interest.""  What the hell?  I can't win over here!

Look, I just wanted what's best for my kid--to be happy and healthy and get into a competitive pre-school.  But this super-genius stuff I can do without.  I'm sending this back and ordering the purple dinosaur.  I want my dumb kid back.",1389052800,38,1818,4.33134328358209
1224663,5,B00000INEW,"Excellent for engaging the mind and capturing the attention of infants. Both of my children have been captivated by the colors, sights, and sounds.",1389052800,,147,5.166666666666667
1224664,5,B00000INEW,2-4 month old son loves it and is occupied for 30-60 minutes.  it gives his mom and i chance to get ready for work in the mornings.,1388793600,,131,3.8518518518518516
1224665,5,B00000INEW,Granddaughter loves it. Watches it all the time. Music soothes her and likes all the colors and shapes. Arrived in time for Christmas.,1388793600,,134,4.869565217391305
1224666,5,B00000INEW,My son loved these videos from about 12 mo to 2 years.  even after he lost interest in watching the video itself he loved listening to the music.  I think Baby Einstein helped develop his ongoing love for all kinds of music.  (He's 7 now)  I buy one or two of the series for everyone I know having a baby.  This is one of my favorites to give.,1388275200,,343,3.985294117647059
1224667,5,B00000INEW,"Our little one is so enjoying this movie, will do believe that this is going to be the favorite out of all the dvd's that we purchased.
His dad agrees",1388016000,,150,4.033333333333333
1224668,5,B00000INEW,This DVD has provided my kids with hours of good music and fun bright colors to watch!  If they were upset they would calm down with the music even if only in the background of the room.,1387929600,,186,4.027027027027027
1224669,4,B00000INEW,Cute video! Baby likes it. Just music and visuals of visually stimulating toys. No language. I especially like the toy box that tells where you can get the toys.,1386806400,,161,4.586206896551724
1224670,1,B00000INEW,Save your money. You are better off just playing classical music while your baby stares at their mobile in his/her crib. The video is just dreadful. It is such a waste you probably have to see it to understand how bad it is. Until then you will think I'm exaggerating. Just know you were warned.,1385510400,,295,4.381818181818182
1224671,5,B00000INEW,"My son loves all the Baby Einsteins!  He can't get enough of them!  We had to wean hm back off most because his doc said he was too young for ""screen time"", but he still watches them, and one is part of his bedtime routine!",1384992000,,223,3.933333333333333
1224672,5,B00000INEW,What can I say? Baby Einstein is awesome! Keeps the attention of your baby and an adult (especially if he's a big kid).,1384819200,,119,4.217391304347826
1224683,5,B00000INEW,"What can I say about this video that hasn't already been said?  Well, after repeated viewings probably totaling near 250-300 plus times, it actually doesnt get on my nerves.  My oldest son, now 3, likes the anticipation of each new scene, such as when the dog flips over or the spider comes down.  He can actually sing the melody along with most of the DVD.  My youngest, 1.5 years old, sit there and says the word for each toy on the screen, such as doggiewoof woof and kitty.meow. A lot of reviewers said this is a great video for getting something done in the kitchen, or you need to distract the kids for a little bit.  I don't use it that way.  I actually sit with my kids.  Each time we do something different with the video.  My oldest now dances to each scene in a different style and sings along while he does it.

Honestly, when it comes to these types of videos, your child while get out of the videos what you as the parent put into them.  If you switch these on and walk away, its just a numb video they watch.  If you sit with them and talk about what is going on, or engage them in some aspect, your child can get more out of it.  For instance, there is a scene to the tune of Twinkle Twinkle where they show various items: kitten, dog, duck, lemon, grapes, and so on.  One viewing we will name the item on the screen. Another we will name the colors.  We talk about the train or what actions are going on in certain scenes.  My oldest also asks whats that and I explain what the toy or object is and some viewings he tries to name everything on the screen.

As for the music  its pleasing, even if its not the original orchestra versions.  My oldest at 3 hums and sings these melodies on his own.  On the few occasions he does hear the original orchestra version, he recognizes the tune immediately.

This is one of the better Baby Einstein videos.  Baby Lullaby comes a close second to holding the interest and attention of my kids.  Dont bother with Baby Beethoven.",1384387200,,1983,4.2600536193029495
1224684,5,B00000INEW,My kids love this baby Einstein and this one only. This was a replacement for our first DVD that died after 4 years. It is a little annoying as a parent but it gets my kids thru long or rough car rides. My only complaint is there is not a continuous play button.,1384041600,,262,3.9622641509433962
1224685,5,B00000INEW,My son loved this video when he was an infant 13 years ago. I was very happy to find out that my nephew loved it just as much.,1383609600,,126,3.5357142857142856
1224686,5,B00000INEW,My baby loves these videos! This Baby Mozart video was great for her for 4-7months. She's now into The World of Rhythm one.,1383350400,,123,4.391304347826087
1224687,5,B00000INEW,"I used to have a Baby Mozart VHS video for my older kids. When it broke down, I got the Baby Mozart DVD right away. It is my 4 year old son's favorite video. He will watch it at home or in the car with his portable DVD player. It keeps him quiet in the car and promotes a non distracted Mommy driver. I like that it is slow and not too loud, and exposes the baby to music. My older children now play piano very proficiently and the baby recognizes the songs from this DVD when he hears them elsewhere. I could see a light bulb go on inside his head.",1383177600,,549,3.9107142857142856
1224688,5,B00000INEW,"Heard about this from a friend. Purchased it for my granddaughter when she visits. She is now 11mos old and sat thru the entire video (28 min long) for the first time yesterday. Prior to that, it kept her attention about 1 min, and then she would go on to play with something else. She would, however, occasionally stop and watch it again for short increments of time. When I watch it with her, I like to verbalize the objects on the screen as a learning tool - i.e. red apple, yellow banana, train, kitten, puppy, etc. There's a lot of colorful, visual stimulation for the child.",1382832000,,580,4.429906542056075
1224689,5,B00000INEW,I rated this a five because my grandaughter loves this video. It keeps her attention throughout the whole video and I would recommmend this to purchase.,1382313600,,152,4.884615384615385
1224690,5,B00000INEW,My five month old grandson is enthralled by the music and images. Holds his attention over and over. Grandmom's best helper there could ever be.,1382227200,,144,4.8
1224691,5,B00000INEW,Keeps babies interested from 6 weeks to 16 months! They love the music and color. Well worth the $$ spent. My kids have been watching this series for the last 15 years!!,1382140800,,169,4.3125
1224692,5,B00000INEW,"It is not only one of my favorite Baby Einstein's because of the music, but my grand babies have all loved the puppets and movement and colors.  I gave this one as a baby shower gift.",1382054400,,183,4.083333333333333
1224712,5,B00000INEW,My little 4 month old grandson kicks his legs and is thoroughly engrossed in this movie each time he watches it.  It really stimulates him and he responds to the music and colorful pictures.  Highly recommend it.,1381968000,,212,4.702702702702703
1224713,4,B00000INEW,"We bought this because our son loves watching his cousin's copy that was purchased in 2007ish.  The newer one is a different version.  Its mostly the same, but there are some small differences.  I noticed, my son didn't.... :)",1380240000,,226,4.743589743589744
1224714,1,B00000INEW,"I don't know why but it freaked out my son ! he doesn't get scared normally. besides it's boring with some of weird things they display

1224717,4,B00000INEW,Was as adversed. 10 month old was mesmerized by the images  and music. With there were more in the series and for older children.,1377993600,,129,4.375

1224720,4,B00000INEW,Mozart's music is a GREAT thing. This video however not only mesmerized my 1 year old son but also my husband. :) Awesome!,1375488000,,122,4.3478260869565215
1224721,3,B00000INEW,I thought this would be more like shapes and colors and animals floating across the screen with Mozart in the back round.  It's more like people holding up toys and clips of toys trains.  I don't see how this is developmental at all.  It did hold my daughters interest some but she wasn't entranced by it.  I think the Disney's Fantasia is way more entertaining with colorful scenes and music.  The CD was useful which is why this got 3 stars.,1374624000,,443,4.419753086419753
1224742,5,B00000INEW,I bought this and a few other Baby Einstien DVDs for my girlfriends 3 month old. He sat and watched them cracking up. Totally worth it to put a smile on his face!!,1373328000,,163,3.9696969696969697
1224743,4,B00000INEW,It's pretty basic stuff. My baby was about 2 1/2 months when I first showed it to her. She loved the black or white screens with bright colors best at first. Now that she's almost 4 months she is more into the parts where they play w toys. It's pathetic that that's all it is but it works to keep their attention so you can get some things done. I will be buying more of the series.,1373068800,,382,3.9740259740259742

1224789,5,B00000INEW,"My youngest son received this video as a gift. I was skeptical about how interesting this DVD would be - the videos are just various clips of toys and images of food, played over classical music (Mozart). After a few months, here's what I think:

Pros:
+ My youngest son is completely mesmerized by the video. I get a half hour of distraction to get chores done.
+ The music is pleasing for everyone in the house (my oldest son likes it too).
+ After a few months they still enjoy watching it.

Cons:
- Lacks any educational value.

The educational value thing bothered me, but DVDs are amazing for buying time. After researching on Amazon, I found and bought these videos to address that problem:

This video was a favorite with my daughter and she usually fell asleep while watching.  It was also good for calming her down when she was more hyper.
The only downfall I have seen is that kids may want some of the enchanting objects seen in the video.

I started my first child on this video when he was about 9 months.  It was a godsend.  I love spending time with my boy but let's face it, there are times when you just have to have 10 minutes or so to yourself so that you can wash the dishes or do laundry; that's when you pop this video in.  It's 25 minutes of entertainment that holds the attention of even very young children.  My wife and I have several of the Baby Einstein videos, but I think Baby Mozart is the one you should start off with when your child is very young (Baby Beethoven is good too) since it is just music, no dialogue.  Move up later to Baby Shakespeare (poetry) and Baby Einstein (languages).  Baby Van Gogh (colors) is also very good.  By age two you'll be graduating to Veggie Tales (but that's for another review).",1063756800,123,971,4.262295081967213

Originally, I was a little concerned about putting my son in front of a tv to occupy his time.  Though, I do not feel that way when I sit him down to watch a Baby Einstein video.

1225100,3,B00000INEW,"Although I must say my children, for the most part, have liked these videos, and this one has been quite handy at bedtime, I do take on a few issues.
I agree with the reviewer that said the dragon, etc. puppetry was scary to sensitive children, although I have felt it more with Baby Bach.
Second,I agree with the reviewer that this video will not help your child become smarter, or develop a true ear.
But, mostly I agree with the reviewer that says ""don't be fooled"" because you are setting them up to embrace total commercialism--plastic, non interactive toys and tinny music.
I am not totally opposed to this video, in fact at times its been a real lifesaver.  But I do believe that it should not become a staple in a baby's daily experience.  The better one to by would be Baby Van Gogh if you want one.",1045094400,2,808,4.38
1225101,5,B00000INEW,"This is a great tape/DVD for parents who (this may be hard to admit) occasionally need a break from their child! I first showed this tape to my colicky baby when she was three months old. She loved it. And I nearly cried with relief. It gave me a half-hour break to go to the bathroom, put the laundry in the dryer, maybe even take a shower.
I would not recommend this tape for a child older than 1. And I would not recommend it for someone who thinks their child is actually going to learn skills from it.
I have several of the Baby Einstein tapes and this is by far the most interesting. The music is lovely and entertaining, and the shapes are fascinating for an infant to watch.
I don't buy it that the Einstein videos are something you can use to interact with your child. I'd rather interact with her while the TV is off. However, it's a great way to keep your baby entertained, and because it theoretically has some educational value, you can feel less guilty about it.
Oh, and one last comment: The CDs that come with the tapes are great for the car. The music is just interesting enough for me to bear, and the music is simple and soothing and puts my sweet baby right to sleep.",1044835200,6,1187,4.256637168141593

This is by far his favorite movie. He is now almost 2, but at 6 months if something or someone got in his view of the T.V. while this video was on he would do everything in his power to move so that he could watch.

If your child watches Brainy Baby, they actually LEARN their ABC's, 123's, Colors, etc. as well as being entertained with BEAUTIFUL images!  I say buy these types of videos for your children, (Right Brain and ABC's are our favorites) but if you want your child to become smarter as well as be entertained with beautiful and creative images, then [choose]Brainy Baby.

Personally, it bores me to tears. My son, on the other hand, can't get enough. He sits in front of the t.v. almost in a trance watching the screen and kicking his little legs.
One important note, while it may be easy to use this as your sitter for 30 minutes of ""me time"" once in a while, it is also important to use the video as a learning tool as well. You can point out shapes and colors on the screen as they appear so that your child actually GETS something from the video. I agree that interaction with your child is most important of all, but come on, 30 minutes a day is not going to ruin your child. While this video may seem addicting to your little one, I can think of much worse things they could be watching.

1225140,3,B00000INEW,"First off, I have to say that my 11 month old son loves this video as well as Baby Van Gogh. For the past couple of months, when you put on the video, he calms if he is fussy, often will sit on my lap and cuddle, and sits mesmerized by the television. He recognizes the word ""video"" and turns to look at the TV. If you are sitting on the side of the couch we sit on to watch he gets mad if you don't turn it on.
As a mother I find this a little spooky. Normally he is constantly going around the room, playing with his toys, walking, making lots of noise. But when I turn this on he is usually in one spot, or he will get off my lap and stand in front of the TV for the whole half hour.
I need to keep myself from playing the video too often. Every day I say I will only let him see once, but when he is fussy, when my mother calls, when I need to bring groceries in from the car I stick him in front of the video to keep him happy. Sometimes he watches it a few times a day.
Normally we hardly ever watch tv, maybe a few shows a week and a movie or video on weekends. So I am not a person who has the TV on all day while I am home with my son. But even I find myself using this video as a babysitter.
Maybe all this sounds great to you, you'd love something to keep baby happy and quiet while you go about your day. But I would rather spend time doing more interactive things with him. And after watching this video countless times I have to say it is not the least bit educational. I guess he is learning to remember what will happen in the video and anticipate the puppets, but playing a mozart cd and reading him books would be better. Just more time consuming for me. A baby learns a thousand times more playing and talking with their parents or caregivers.
So I will continue to use this video on rare useful occasions, perhaps purchasing additional ones for variety, but need to keep a strict watch on myself that I don't let my son watch too much during the day.

Before the initial showing to our girl when she was about 5 months old, I played it for myself just to see what it was like.  After viewing it, I thought, ""Wow, how can this entertain a child?""
I plopped our girl in front of it a few days later, and lo and behold she was just riveted by it.  And she has been ever since.  Julie Clark and company hit a home run when they put the music and images together for this video!
The amusing thing is that now as I play it, I have the stupid thing memorized, so at certain moments I can make the sounds that are about to come on the screen and my daughter gets a kick out of that, too.

We, propped him up in his play seat and turned the VCR on.  After 3-4 minutes of the boring FBI warnings and preliminary credits, the show begins.  Music, colors, shapes, toys and hand-puppets are the stars of the show.
At first, our little guy simply stared....probably because the color schemes and the music caught his attention.  But within the first 10 minutes it was clear that he was ""drawn"" into the show.  He'd drop his current toys to direct 100% attention to the action on the screen.  My wife and I enjoyed his reactions to the characters and toys as much as he enjoyed watching them.
His favorite part of the show (which usually gets a good giggle) is when the FunDragon comes out, smiling at first, then a big ""BLEEEAHHH""!  At first our little guy would jump right out of his diaper when the FunDragon reared his cute little tongue!  We'd love the surprised look on his face, but his attention never faded.  Nowadays, he's grown to know that the FunDragon is not scary, but makes a fun silly sound!
Highly recommended!",1024963200,10,1305,4.534188034188034
1225184,2,B00000INEW,"I bought this along with the brainy baby tape(left brain) and had them both shipped at the same time . Its as simple as this- the baby mozart scared my baby into hysterics!! And the other didnt. The Mozart is very simtulating -yes  BUT it seems alot more intense then brainy baby, meaning the brainy baby has a white background and seems to be a 'happier' tape than the Baby Einstein. The Mozart has a black backdrop and seems to have a very intense feeing to it! THIS MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE TO MANY PEOPLE BUT AFTER WATCHING MY SON  FREAK OUT TO THIS AND TOTAL AND UTTER FASINATION WITH THE OTHER,  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO EXPLAIN IT!! I myself can see the difference  and  much prefer the Brainy baby tapes. Plus- He still gets the stimulation that it claims ! He giggles to it , stares at it , babbles to it and most importantly -gives me a half hour to myself!! lol  When i put the other on the screen ,he doesnt seem that intrested, doesnt give it his full attention like the brainy baby and ends up getting a fright from it most days! Needless to say- i don't put it on the vcr anymore.
  Hope this helps someone out there!",1024012800,3,1127,4.185185185185185

There are toys in motion, puppets, fiber optic lamps with changing colors, still pictures of fruits and animals, colored water toys, etc...  My daughter gets bored with a few of the segments (still pictures of fruits and animals), but that is OK because another segment is going to start in just a few seconds.  She loves the puppets and brightly colored water toys.  I really like it because humans are not in the video (only hands that are playing with the toys).

She reacted to each different item and the change in music.  My only regret was that I didn't buy it earlier.  Now I put it on and she laughs when she knows her favourite part is next.

The music is set to colorful visual imagery--toys, flowing colors, puppets, etc., and is a perfect mix of bubbly, fun tunes and more traditional classical pieces. There's a sense of playfulness and humor to the video; parents will love the way it catches a child's attention without being overbearing, patronizing, or excessively cute. It's educational in a gentle, entertaining way, with some good options on the DVD to enhance the experience (the flash cards are great). My son can be in the middle of an ungodly tantrum, and will IMMEDIATELY calm down when this is played. Heck, this is the only thing he'll sit still for!

We played it again for him at about 6 weeks old and he watched it all the way through. Now it is one of his daily activities. There are some scenes he's not crazy about but they change just fast enough to recapture his attention. The length of time is just enough to give you a break and sometimes our son is so soothed by the classical music he falls to sleep. We plan on useing the language lab when he's a bit older. This has been so entertaining for him that we are already planning to buy more from this series. This really is a great product and wonderful education tool.",1001462400,2,733,4.062068965517241
1225317,2,B00000INEW,"While I do not disagree that this is a good video, I want to point out that if you have an easily excited baby, this may not be a good choice for your baby. My baby is 5 months old and since she was 3 months she has occasionally watched bits of the video (we are still not through the whole video). She watches it very intently for a few minutes and then starts screaming and crying! After she sees the video she is so would up that she falls apart at the littlest thing for the next 3 days! She is much happier if I let her watch airplanes on TV with the music on instead.",1001376000,,573,3.905982905982906
1225318,4,B00000INEW,"I was a bit skeptical about how interesting this DVD would be for a 3-4 month old baby but decided to take a quick gamble on it based on other reviews on the site.
When first viewing the DVD, parents should forget what they ""think"" a baby video should be and really step back and try to see the world from a baby""s point of view. At first, the imagery and transitions seem a bit silly, but after watching my son (now 4.5 months) react to the video, I'm looking forward to showing him the next step in the series.
While it is too easy to just sit him down in front of the TV when you need a brief 30 minute respite, it is actually a lot of fun watching it together because he gives such a positive reaction, smiling and laughing when his favorite images and music come on.
What is especially endearing is his reaction to the opening jingle and scene of the 3D caterpillar inching across the screen; as soon as he hears the chimes, he breaks out in a big grin and starts to become very excited.
Overall, highly recommended for any parent looking for something to stimulate and entertain a young baby.",1000857600,21,1098,4.283653846153846

She no longer just trys to eat her toys she emulates what she see's in the videos. The best part about this DVD is that is calms her down! If she is fussy and out of control my wife and I both just look at each other and say ""Baby Mozart"". It works like a charm everytime. She calms down and laughs and you can watch her eyes following things on the screen. It's a blast to sit down and watch it with her and explain things.

One day I turn it on and she just stared at the TV and didn't move. We now use it EVERYDAY. If she is crankly, I can turn either Mozart or Bach on and she quiets immediately. Sometime, when it ends, she crawls to the TV and touches the screen until I turn it on again and again. One day we watched it for almost 2 hours before I could tear her away from it. We cuddle and talk about the pictures, because many of the toys/props are common baby toys she has in her toy box. At night, it only takes 10-15 mins. while rocking and she is asleep. We use it as our regular nighttime routine. Overall, it's fantastic for educational activities, just playing, sleeping, calming, and when I need a few seconds to my self.

1225350,1,B00000INEW,"My wife and I are continuously trying to give our baby daughter all the help and support she can get, especially when it comes to her learning and mental growth. We worked with the ideas outlined in the book 'Prenatal Classroom' before she was born, and apparently with great succes. Our daughter spoke her first 2 real words at the tender age of 5 months, and ever since then she has not looked back.
As you can imagine I was thrilled when I saw this video, along with Baby Einstein. We had worked a lot with playing different kinds of classical music to her, while in the womb, so I bought them both without hessitating.
However, the idea of the videos might be sound, but the content or rather the execution of those videos simply leave you with a lot to ask for. There are days when our daughter is scared when you put them on, but on most days she is simply not interested at all. And I can understand why. The quality of the video, is what you could have made yourself in an afternoon with your home video equipment and a few of your child's toys. For that I think they were quite pricey, not even considering the uninteresting contents.
By now we, as parents, have a good idea of what toys not just interest our daughter, but also stimulate her learning and exploring. This simply just doesn't have what it takes. You suspect a cynical business man behind it all, that wants to milk a few bucks off the whole movement of progressive learning. So take our advice, and save yourself a disappointment.

When he was teething this video was about the only thing that would calm him in the middle of the night.  He has moved onto other things now but just the sound of the opening drumming bear brings a big smile and gets his attention. And to me it's a lot easier on my ears and eyes than character videos!

The other features of the DVD, such as the language center are a definite plus.  I've learned a lot of vocabulary from it (now I can say ""cat"" in 10 languages - and thus qualify for a cushy job at the UN), and my daughter seems to enjoy the language center as well.

It was truley a blessing. Our baby watched it from begining to end everyday. I gave us a much needed break and we believe it is very educational at the same time.

It is gentle and soothing to match the simple (yet perfectly hypnotizing to your little guy or gal). The problem is that in two different sections (the music stops) and a hand puppet and giant spider on a string jump out and make a HUGE SCARRY NOISE!

I discovered that the soothing music and images in this video would very often calm him down. Also, when he was older and would awaken from a nightmare this video was useful in helping him to calm down, more than just sitting with him quietly, because it provided a calming distraction.
Besides that, my son really enjoyed watching the video, from before he could sit up until the present, when he can talk about what he is seeing.

My wife and I also grew to love baby mozart.  It gave a peaceful and warm feeling to our house when it was playing every morning, sometimes over and over.
In particular Max liked ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" (aka ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" aka ""ABCDEFG..."", which was an old French folk song of unknown origins hovering in the collective ear of the world back then when Mozart wrote a series of variations on it).  Whenever this one started to play (it appears at least twice on the tape) Max would smile and begin to hum.  At first and for a long time he only hummed the first two notes (""Hmm Hmm"").
When Max had to have an operation at the age of one this tape brightened up his four-day hospital stay immeasurably.  I brought it to him the day after his operation, and his little ""hmm hmm"" when ""Twinkle"" began brought tears to my eyes.  This video was better than medicine.
The only annoying thing about it is the whole ""baby genius"" concept and the inane pseudoscientific garbage at the end.  I always had to race to stop the tape at the end before this came blaring out of the tv.  It's beautiful music, that's all, and all babies love music and all minds benefit from it.",978048000,2,1340,4.332

I could not believe it was able to capture his attention the way it did!  Now, at just 10 weeks old, he enthusiastically sits through the entire video!  The music is synchronized well with the images.  At his young age, he finds the fluid shapes and colors more engaging than the stuffed animals and play toys.  But we are so excited about his interaction with the video and I would recommend it highly to new parents.  We have not tried the other videos in this series yet, but I would certainly start with this one.",977788800,6,623,4.237288135593221
1225402,5,B00000INEW,"My husband & I have been classical music fans since we were young, and wanted our daughter to grow up with an appreciation for it as well. She LOVES her Baby Mozart!  I started playing it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She now will go to the video cabinet and pull it off the shelf for us to put in the VCR.  She can also be in another room playing, and when we pop it into the player, and turn it on she will come running the second she hears the orchestra warming up.  She loves the music and will clap and dance around the living room.  She also loves the animal puppets and will make the noises the animals make as they appear on the screen.  I highly reccommend Baby Mozart to any parent of young children.  It is worth its weight in gold! My husband and I also love what we call our ""baby mozart time"".  Our daughter is so captivated by it, that we can actually have some mom & dad time to talk or get other things done without worrying about where she is or what she is up to.",975369600,,994,3.984848484848485

My son has been watching them since 3 months old and is still as delighted with them now as he was in the beginning (he's now 13 months).  I definately believe that they have had a positive effect on my son's cognitive skills; granted, I don't know how ""smart"" he would have been without them, but due to a birth trauma my son has brain damage.  Nonetheless, he is 10-14 months ahead in cognitive and spatial skills (sorting, matching, etc.).  We have also used the images, toys, puppets, etc. in these videos in order teach him ""baby signs"", and at 13 months old he has an active sign vocabulary of over 10 words, in addition to the standard ""brooooom"", ""moooo"" etc. for car, cow, etc.  I definately credit the videos.  And, even if they *don't* make your child smarter, they can't be beat for being an attention getter.  My son loves to watch them, point things out, dance to the music.  I highly recommend them.",974764800,7,989,4.4860335195530725

1225411,4,B00000INEW,"Our 16-month old watches both Baby Mozart and Baby Bach and Mozart is the clear winner.  Be advised that this series does not offer a lot of depth of exposure to classical music--the short musical clips that are offered are severely edited, and very repetitive.  But consider the audience; kids LOVE repetition and familiarity.  At least you will find yourself (and probably your child) humming Mozart and Bach tunes, which may impress your friends and coworkers more than the commercial jingles you used to sing!  I think that most of the so-called ""Mozart effect"" claims that are made on behalf of products like these could more readily be explained by the parent-child interaction that Ms. Clark encourages.  These videos each offer an entertaining half hour of kinetic toys, puppets, and common objects (like candles) that fascinate the very young.  If you only buy one of the Baby Einstein series, opt for Mozart.  The sound quality is better, the visuals are  better, and the music is emphasized more.",971481600,9,1007,4.9880239520958085

I am not saying this video definately made my baby smart because I don't know how smart he would be if he hadn't watched the video. But, he is very curious and can do activities way beyond his age. He is putting shapes in his shape sorter and he has a wonderful vocabulary. ( he only says MA MA and DA DA and BA BA, but he talks constantly in his own language.) There might actually be something to this Mozart Effect. ( My own math skills have sharpened!) Anyway, BUY THIS MOVIE! Your baby will LOVE it!",970704000,2,640,4.128
1225413,5,B00000INEW,"This was the first video that we bought for our daughter when she was less than 6 months old.  When we first started to play it I was very disappointed.  To an adult, it seems like it's just a bunch of video shots of toys in motion, with music in the background.  To my surprise, my daughter loved it.  She was fascinated by it and looked forward to watching it every evening.  The movement, colors, and music really held her attention and she never tired of watching it.  About the time she turned one she did seem to lose interest in it and preferred other videos.  I highly recommend this to anyone with a very young child.
The only negative about it is that there is a commentary at the end of the tape where the producers make various claims about how listening to Mozart's music can boost a child's IQ and other abilities.  Most research that I've read indicates that these benefits are overstated or nonexistent.  Buy the tape because it's fun, not because it will turn your child into a genius.",970617600,4,1002,4.4316939890710385

He still loves all the playful images and toys but views them as a show of  small interactive stories (and not just like stimulating images). And there  is no doubt that music of Mozart and other great classical composers  broadens child's intellectual capacities and interest in different types of  music. There is no need to toss the video out once your child leaves  toddlehood behind. There is a new opportunity for preschoolers to engage  their imagination and interaction with the world while listening to the  great music.",968544000,,679,4.793103448275862

At first I was a bit disappointed: I  expected orchestra arrangements and better production values. But soon I  realized, duh, it's for kids, not adults. The simple musical arrangements  and low tech images are right on target for babies. Kate LOVES this video.  As soon as the opening credits begin, her hands and feet begin to dance and  a big smile appears. We point out the different images  (""bear"",""apple"",""train""....""colorful  whirling thingie"") to make it a family interactive time. The  educational component makes us feel a little less guilty over TV having  anything to do with the education/entertainment of our precious bundle of  joy. It would be easy to get sucked into the ""video babysitter""  vortex (Kate is totally enthralled for 30, count 'em, 30 minutes) but, like  anything else, the video is great when used in moderation.  Kate's now 10  1/2 months and just as excited about watching Baby Mozart.  We've added  Baby Bach to her repertoire too.",968284800,153,1079,4.93854748603352

He is now about 26 months but he still loves it.  It contains all sorts of  interesting toys, hand puppets, and of course the enhanting music of  Mozart, which may actually help your child's intellectual  development.
Baby Mozart is like a wonderful magic spell that will  captivate your child.  As your child begins to talk, it is a good way to  have him/her learn new words.  When we watched with him, we called out the  name or some characteristic of each toy and before long my son was  identifying the objects himself.
For some variation, I also recommend you  consider Baby Bach and Baby Shakespeare.  All in all it's a terrific  series.",959212800,8,780,4.4714285714285715
