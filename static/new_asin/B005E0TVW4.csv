8467817,5,B005E0TVW4,"This disturbing program focuses on the aftermath of  the concentration camps in German occupied countries. The atrocities are horrendous, but teach a valuable lesson. The camps in the show are liberated by the allies and justice served on the personnel left behind after the higher ups fled. Warning: This video is very graphic and not for everyone. But history isn't always pretty though it should always serve as a warning, to what can happen when people refuse to acknowledge the evil of their governments. And simply go blindly along with the program.",1386806400,,555,5.032608695652174
