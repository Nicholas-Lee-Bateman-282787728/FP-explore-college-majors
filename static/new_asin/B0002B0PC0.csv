Second, if you're an adult who digs on silly naughty  fun, grab it.  From the same folks who brought you the anime Cutey Honey,  really silly fun abounds when our heroine attends a boarding school, run by  a very weird and wacky bad guy, whom if I remember correctly, is called  something like the Big Evil Toenail (don't quote me on that, I've only seen  it once).  Wacky weirdness ensues, I wouldn't call it hentai, but I'd  definately call it fun.

2073669,5,B0002B0PC0,"NYPD Blue, Law & Order, The Wire ... it all started here. While the literary police procedural got launched in 1945 by Lawrence Treat's pulp novel ""H is for Homicide,"" Webb's creation leapfrogged over film and connected this new subgenre, offspring of Raymond Chandler's and Dashiell Hammett's hard-boiled detective fiction, with the even-newer medium of television. When Dragnet first aired in 1952, TV had penetrated fewer than 10% of US households; when its first run ended in 1959, the percentage was almost ten times that. Add in the commercial tie-ins (look online for clips of Jack Webb, in character [when was he ever OUT of it?] hawking Chesterfield cigarettes) and you've got the one of the main roots of television as a short-form combination of commerce and art, the other roots being westerns and variety shows.

Curiously, these earliest episodes do not yet incorporate the familiar ""dum ... dee-DUMP-dum"" theme, but otherwise they're vintage Dragnet, reproducing with stark (for the time) accuracy the routines of a city police department. And no wonder -- creator/writer/producer/director/star Webb hired real cops as technical advisors, and offered a $25 reward to any officer submitting a story idea -- the LAPD reportedly used episodes as training films.

Quality of these DVDs is just fine considering they're digitized from who knows what obsolete technology.",1269820800,2,1380,5.325688073394495

2073671,4,B0002B0PC0,"I keep expecting Scotty JX to hit at least one ball out of the park, and he had a real opportunity to do it with this one. Instead this is more like one of those 425-and-a-half-foot shots that gets robbed at the fence.

""Western Babes"" is in most respects the best effort of all of the Actiongirls titles. It's certainly the raunchiest and most explicit, and that's a good thing (the girls are amazingly hot and they share every part of themselves with you--except, in most cases, their voices).

Problem is, Scotty JX takes what would have been a five-plus star production and turns it into a psychedelic experience, with outlandishly-quick cuts and white fades (using the word ""fade"" here is inaccurate, as they are so brief, they really are transitional white flashes). In one of the last scenes, for instance, two scorchingly-hot unnamed ladies dance and writhe in the buff on a storefront porch as the camera gets all up in their uh, business. But you're hard-pressed really to get a good look at anything because each cut lasts maybe a quarter-second. So you get a quarter-second, white flash, quarter second, white flash.

Unfortunately most of the ""movie"" is presented in this way. (Seriously, do we even need to refer to these as movies anymore? No plot, no dialogue, no real scenes for that matter, just lots of gyrating naked women. The only thing that ties it all together is that they're all wearing Western-looking gear, at least until they get naked, and the sets look like backdrops from an abandoned Wild West theme park live show.)

I'm just trying to figure out why he screwed up so much great footage of so many gorgeous women like this. I'd have been singing his praises had he simply done the editing the right way. Instead, I'm still trying to overcome the motion sickness. And I'm not joking, don't even think of watching this if you have epilepsy or another condition that might be set off by bright, flashing lights.

If you're into this genre, you're going to want to see this because there are some seriously amazing-looking women in it. But don't surprised if you end up titillated, yet frustrated.",1246838400,8,2127,4.737837837837838

2073675,5,B0002B0PC0,"This is a great collection of the original Dragnet show from the 1950s.
Those who are familiar only with the 1960's version will be pleasantly surprised how close the original series is to that version.
Some of the same actors and actresses appear in both series, even some of the stories are the same!
Anyway, there are 20 episodes (8+ hours) of great black & white crime drama.
The quality of the prints used ranges from so-so to good.
The digital transfer is generally good.
The sound level is a bit low on some episodes.
Part of the opening and closing credits have been edited out.
If you are looking for a DVD collection of the 1950's version of Dragnet, this set offers the best value.",1209945600,23,692,4.5

8025372,5,B0002B0PC0,"I really enjoyed this early Dragnet and wished there were more episodes on the disc!
It's 95 min. and has about 4 or 5 episodes on it.
It's a very primitive DVD menu. You can either ""Play Movie"" (though it is NOT a movie) or you can go to ""Scene Select"". The episodes are not separated for individual selection so ""Scene Select"" doesn't do you a lot of good. (this is also why I can't remember exactly how many episodes are on it. I watched it a while ago and there have been a lot of Dragnet's under the bridge since then.)
It is in black and white.

The Show:
If you've only seen the later Dragnet (1967-70 with Harry Morgan as Jacks partner) You'll find this earlier series is VERY similar in a good way. His partner Officer Frank Smith (Ben Alexander) is the humor much like Officer Bill Gannon (Harry Morgan) though there was overall less of that personal side stories. Sgt. Joe Friday (Jack Webb) is still telling you the date, time, and dept. (and if it were possible) I think his narration is even faster than the later series! His serious, professional manner is the same, and you'll find he's still catching the same crooks! (it was funny to see some of the same actors and actresses that I saw on the later Dragnet series in this one: Stacy Harris, Peggy Webber, Virginia Gregg)
Though I prefer color and crisper film quality, I really enjoyed these episodes and would love to buy more if I could find them!",1481328000,,1418,4.412213740458015
8025373,1,B0002B0PC0,"Picked this up, and on playing was struck by the 'piano riff' which appeared to substitute every place where the classic Dragnet theme would have been expected. My suspicion is the TV episodes may have passed into the public domain, but the Dragnet theme itself was still under copyright, hence the alteration. Or possibly, it was so Digiview could assert its own copyright (the substitution *does* make it unique).

The cover art and disc menus implied that the episodes were colorized - they were not. I *was not* disappointed they were not colorized (that would have been another kind of alteration), but the implications that they were are false and misleading.

I was slightly entertained by the copyright boiler plate stating this product (including soundtrack) was licensed for home viewing only, and could not be played in clubs, coaches, hospitals, oil rigs, prisons, or schools.",1474156800,,888,5.117241379310345

8025375,4,B0002B0PC0,"The shows are interesting, especially because they're based on true stories, and short - thanks to no commercials. These original programs, however, lack Sgt. Friday's eventual partner - Bill Gannon.",1340582400,,199,5.666666666666667
8025376,5,B0002B0PC0,"Being a TV Kid, the ""Dragnet"" of the late 60's was my first exposure to the rough and tumble, monotone and serio-comic world created by series star Jack Webb.  Why Harry Morgan, Webb's onscreen partner, never won an emmy for that knowing nod and the requisite softball across the plate to set up a memorable Joe Friday zinger, I will never know.  The rat-a-tat dialogue, the guest stars, and the important social warnings (like taking LSD WILL cause you to paint half of your face blue and stick your head in the dirt) all made the show a pleasurable way to spend 24 minutes.

But to discover that a series by the same name existed a DECADE earlier, starring a much younger and robust Joe Friday and presenting a crime-fighting TEAM to help him clean up the streets of L.A.--was a true find.  Short of exhaustive restoration, the quality of these DVDs are likely the best you're going to get from an old b&w TV show.  These programs are mini-film noir....glorious shadows, the City of Angels in the early 50's and the brand new, now-classic cars help to tell great short stories with pretty good performances.  Drugs, murder, prostitution, blackmail, forensics (ha ha) all brought to your screen in gun-blazing, black and white glory.  This very inexpensive set has 20 episodes from 1952-1958 and my family and friends are enjoying every minute of them.  You will, too!",1304812800,,1369,4.746835443037975
8025377,2,B0002B0PC0,"I admit that I didn't read the previous reviews, and snatched this up on the spur of the moment with another item I'd ordered. I was attracted by the price and by the apparent completeness of the earliest of Dragnet episodes. I'm puzzled by the omission of the Dragnet theme, so iconic that without it, the shows seem very flat. I'm disappointed at the video quality as well, as if these are copied from a well worn film rather than the masters. Overall, for the cheap price, I guess one can't expect too much.",1296864000,5,510,4.4361702127659575
