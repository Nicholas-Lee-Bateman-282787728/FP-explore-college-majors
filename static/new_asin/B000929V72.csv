2260356,5,B000929V72,"To begin, Elfen Lied is not an anime for the faint of heart. The levels of violence and gore found in this 13-episode series far exceed anything I've come across so far. However, at the same time, this is not an anime which one should simply disregard as another ploy to pull in fans and cash by showcasing lots and lots of killing.

Instead, this is an anime with a surprisingly deep and interesting story. Because it is so original in its plot, it is very difficult to predict. The fact that the producers still managed to incorporate a modest amount of comedic relief into the entire mix really made this series quite unique.

As for characters, overall they are fairly well developed. While it would have been nice to see a bit more time devoted to character development, I can't say that I'm disappointed since it is mainly the side characters which have somewhat 2-D personalities ( although all still do come off as likeable ).

Moving on to music, all I can really say is ""wow."" This is one series with a truly amazing soundtrack. Now, I'm aware that most people today aren't overly fond of classical, but Elfen Lied puts it to good use and managed to raise the hairs along the back of my neck on more then one occasion.

And finally animation. Good is the best word for it. Its obviously not up to par with certain series out there such as Macross Zero, but relatively speaking, at least in my opinion, I thought that the animation would still let it come in among the top 10 percent.

So, to conclude, if you still haven't gotten the picture (^_^), Elfen Lied is most definitely an anime worth your time. While very violent, the story and brilliant soundtrack more then make up for any queasiness one might feel. So unless you truly believe that you will be unable to handle something violent, I highly encourage everyone to give this series a chance.",1115856000,4,1861,4.526785714285714

2260358,5,B000929V72,"Elfen Lied is without a doubt, one of the best anime to come out in 2004.  The animation is top-notch.  Character development is unparalleled.  Each individual is distinctly unique and has well-established history, goals and morals.  The soundtrack never fails to set the mood and the intro as well as the credits are impressive as well.  However, what tops off this masterpiece is how the story keeps you on the edge of your seat down to the last second of episode 13.  There is never a dull moment and the plot keeps rolling strongly without ever slowing down.

The basic premise for driving the plot is a race of highly-evolved, psychic humans called diclonius.  The distinctive feature of these people are two, small, bony growths protruding from above the ears (the nature of the word ""diclonius"" comes from a dinosaur, which possessed two horns, hence, the ""di"" prefix).  Their hidden power is the manipulation of matter with invisible arms.

The story starts off in a remote, island research facility where the most powerful diclonus, Lucy is being held captive.  Mysteriously loosened from her bonds, she fights her way out of the building and succeeds in killing most of the security force (with extremely bloody results).  Because the scientists experimenting with her race don't consider her to be a human, she is not clothed during this rampage.  Unscathed, Lucy is nearing escape when she is not quite successful in deflecting a headshot from a .50 caliber rifle.

Senseless, lost and naked she wanders to a beach quite a distance away.  It turns out that the wound from the bullet has activated a second personality within Lucy, which is devoid of anger and full of innocence.  ""Nyu,"" is the name of her alter ego.  She is noticed a short time later by two cousins, Kouta and Yuka.  While Yuka attempts to find this strange girl some clothes, Kouta is having terrible flashbacks from his childhood.  Memories of a girl he once knew; possessing horns on her head.

While the plot does not escape from a weak male lead, which has been overused in the anime genre, there are more than enough strong points to make up for this.  The most revolutionary part of Elfen Lied is the way it uses what would normally be called questionable or offensive material and then makes the characters and storyline stronger (as opposed to making the viewer look away or sickened).  I've seen other anime, which can simply be described as soft-porn and devoid of story.  Others promote random violence, once again, without any story to back it up.  Elfen Lied does well where these have failed.

The major opponents of Elfen Lied cannot see or understand Lynn Okamoto's (the author) vision from beneath the gore and skin.  Such people are too superficial to look deeper into her creation and appreciate the underlying gems, which all great stories possess.

I must also admit that this anime is not for the faint of heart.  The blood and nudity makes for a strong R type rating, so children should be kept away.  However, I'll stress again that these aspects of the plot do not detract, but instead add to the storyline.  If you can handle these crucial moments, then this anime is definitely for anyone who wants to be touched by a story I can simply describe as spectacular.

The dynamic personality struggle between Lucy and Nyu is something which I will never forget.  Her disposition constantly transforms from a temperamental psychopath to a cute and loveable child at just the right time to make you love her just barely more than you hate her.  It is such perfection which makes me wish I could give Elfen Lied ten of five stars.",1114732800,32,3630,4.766025641025641

Shocking in many more ways then the violence in this film, this anime will be loved by those who enjoy films that reflect a variety of emotions.  I, myself could not stop watching the episodes until I reached the finale.  Strangely mesmerizing, it is well worth watching.  However, if you are one who does NOT like gore (especially severed body parts) or are offended by a naked cartoon female, this anime is not for you. ENJOY!!",1114560000,13,559,4.626262626262626
2260361,1,B000929V72,"I acknowledge that tastes and preferences vary with different people and people can enjoy anything that they happen to find enjoyable. But it is too clear in my mind that those who rave about this rather pointless title like it for the sheer shock and gore factor. They will call it deep and outstanding yet unable to substantiate the claim. They will concoct and articulate reasons to justify praise, however baseless they will be, without considering its most critical flaws: a desparately contrived premise and plot, and nonsensical character relationships and development. When it comes down to it, this Love Hina dramedy that is Elfen Lied is devoid of any substance and merits way below and far too short of the hype that it is given.

Elfen Lied gives us yet another male lead character who reinforces the pathetic excuse that he is for a man who after learning the terrifying truth does the most insensible thing, as if the concept of outrage and the vindication of justice had been completely foreign to him! And are we supposed to like Lucy just because she on occasion is a ridiculously idiotic moron that babbles ""nyu"" and exposes skin? She's a loathesome piece of genetic debris that was not dealt with in any satisfactory manner. While Nana and ""Papa"" do arouse quite a bit of sympathy for what they suffer, the characterizations of everyone else evoke only frustration or abomination. Tell me how is it that a homeless girl, whose backstory sheds no light as to what purpose her being homeless serves in the story, does not become a jaded cynic by dining on her pet dog's food? And were we to become more accepting of the loser male lead character by pairing him up with another such weak-willed and equally inconsequential counterpart as his love interest? Was contrasting the diclonius Lucy with a mercenary psychopath supposed to make me understand and empathize with her plight? What nonsense! The title fails in all attempts to accurately portray the human condition, much less comment on it all while futilely trying to entertain.

So we have the race of beings called diclonius that is the superior and replacement of the homosapien race, on the basis that they possess powerfully lethal vector arms. However, that they apparently lack a very keen intellect explains why at least two of them are too easily influenced and controlled by manifestations of paternal love and that their basic instinct is to tear everything asunder. And few as they were, would they hope to successfully eradicate homosapiens to become the dominant race by confronting one another in mortal combat at the bidding of their would-be enemies? The machination behind the contradictory devices was faulty at best, deceitfully calculative at worst.

Say that the story is even somewhat plausible, the poor conception of the characters, their make-up, background, and most notably the artificiality of their interaction unforgivably undermine the entire effort. To those who maintain their misguided affection for this title, obtusely confusing superfluous violence for aesthetics, contriving a mixture of cliches for originality, and contradictions and plot holes for depth, have you not ever seen before a superior combination of gratuitous violence and sex 20 years ago with Golgo 13: The Professional?

If macabre, dark tragedies and disturbing studies of the decadent human condition is what inspires you, then try seeing Neon Genesis Evangelion first. Then watch Grave of the Fireflies, Gantz, Alien Nine, Berserk, and Narutaru, all of which employ and depict violence more stylishly yet purposefully to make a point about the inescapable and ever present human suffering, of which the human is the sole cause.

Elfen Lied is exemplary of an utter failure to convey its message. By wantonly resorting to ecchi slapstick, fanservice, forced relationships and entirely misaligned emotions, Elfen Lied laboriously succeeds at simply becoming a harem anime masquerading as Faces of Death and Mary Shelley's famous literature. It merely feeds the basest of senses to dupe unwitting viewers much in the same way that televised human atrocities and porn do. A masterpiece? Please don't take the word so lightly. One of the best animes ever? Hah! I jest at the silly notion and declare that the deduction that forms such sentiment is unsubstantiated rubbish. What a rip off!

2260364,5,B000929V72,"I have never recalled watching an anime that made me almost sick to my stomach and yet, love it at the same time.

  I have never seen an anime that utilizes the cuteness of a character (that reminds me a lot like Supercatgirl Nuku Nuku) and characters that almost remind me of something that came out of ""Ah! My Goddess"" and throw in a twist that makes this anime that could have been like other anime's, so unique.

  Confused?  Let me explain.

  In some facility is where this bio- engineered girl named Lucy is held captive.

  She is a diclonius.  A mutated human but has horns which extrude from her cranium and has the power of vectors (invisible arms that destroy everything it comes in contact with).

  The first five or ten minutes of episode 1 features Lucy literally decapitating and tearing up the security guards sent in to stop her.  She's invincible it seems.

  Interesting enough, the anime throws in a cute girl who is trying not to be clumsy and someone you may expect to be a major character in the story...  that is until Lucy decapitates her and uses her body as a shield.

  Needless to say, Lucy escapes from the facility but the facility with one powerful shot to her cranium (instead of killing her) sends her onto the ocean.

  That is where we are introduced to childhood friends Kohta and Yuka.  Yuka has feelings for Kohta but he's completely oblivious to it.

  One day at the beach and they find a naked girl who just says ""Nyu"".  She doesn't seem to know much words and she's has a brain of a toddler it seems but with a hot body.

  After taking her in to Kohta's place, you get to learn about Kohta and Yuki and this sets up things for episode 2.

  In episode 2, A special assault team is sent to kill Lucy/Nyu but Kohta who feels compassion for Nyu decides to help her.

  Has Lucy/Nyu lost her murderous manners?  Episode 2 shows us the power of Lucy and perhaps that shot to her head may have given her a split personality of a caring, cute girl and when pissed off, to a murderous diclonius.

  With all the attention that Kohta is giving Lucy, Yuka becomes jealous and a love triangle is obviously being added to this storyline.

  In episode 3, another diclonius named Nana is sent to find Lucy and to eliminate/retrieve her.

  Just watching these three episodes, I was a bit surprised by the enormous violence in this anime.

  Granted, I watch quite a bit of this kind of anime but ""Fist of the North Star"" and ""GANTZ"" which has quite a bit of violence has no comparison to the level that is shown in the first and second episodes of ""ELFEN LIED"".

  Since this was shown on television, I'm not sure to what extent it was censored but this anime is unique.

  It takes the elements of what you would find in your typical cute girl anime, romantic comedy anime and throws in this twist with the cute and beautiful girl with dual personalities going on murderous rampages.

  The truth is that Lucy is possibly the person who can end all humanity, yet the anime makes you feel supportive of her because she has that dual personality of being a cute, caring girl.

  Throw into the mix that when Nyu goes into Lucy mode, she had chances to murder Kohta but something prevents her from doing so.

  As for the DVD, there were no special reviews for the DVD I reviewed but I can tell you that the animation is well done.

  The character designs almost reminded me of ""Ah! My Goddess"" and the voice acting, since I only watched it dubbed is not bad.

  As for the audio, I was impressed by the digital 5.1 surround sound at parts of the anime where you can hear footsteps and door creaking coming from the rear speakers.

  All in all, I highly recommend ""ELFEN LIED"" because it's unique and it combines the type of anime that I enjoy.

  At the same time, if you can't stomach excessive violence or blood in your animation, you may want to pass.

  ""ELFEN LIED"" is an anime that literally has won me over despite the excessive violence.  It's that good!",1218585600,,3997,4.403314917127072
2260365,2,B000929V72,"(Review for entire show).

No, cousin, I don't want to fondle your breast.

That pretty much sums up my feelings for this show right there. Elfen Lied, despite what so many sappy, shallow people would tell you, is nowhere NEAR a masterpiece; I wouldn't even go so far as to call it good. It is, for all intents and purposes, a woefully inadequate attempt at a drama which falls far short of tragedy greats in anime such as ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Kino's Journey"", ""Now and Then, Here and There"", and yes Neon Geneses Evangelion. It is an ant amongst giants. Fans of the series will point to the many instances of drama and ""tear jerking moments"" as proof that there is substance of any kind to be found here, but they would be wrong. Instead of coming off as depressing, the more appalling moments in this show come across as more disgusting than anything else. Whereas moments in shows like ""Now and Then, Here and There"" and EVA showed tragedy in ways which were designed to not only depress its viewers but also leave them with ""heartbreaking fondness;"" Elfen Lied simply wants to gross you out as much as humanly possible.

Just about every moment of this show is saturated with fan service almost to the point, no, take that back, TO the point of absurdity. Some fan service here and there is okay, I don't really like it but its fine, but THIS MUCH!? How many times do I have to see Lucy (or Nyu, which is her alter ego) shamble around on screen wearing nothing but socks? How many times must I have to see Mayu (who's 13 BTW) take a bath with Nanna (who is also 13)? Nothing makes you feel like a pervert more than watching a couple 13 year olds take a bath together for ten minutes. Am I supposed to watch or should I look away?

The show starts off with a ten minute bloodbath as a naked Lucy strolls though the hulls of a heavenly protected government research lab killing literally hundreds of well armed soldiers and guards (and one very unfortunate, very clumsy secretary). She manages to escape but is shot in the head, which then causes her to lose her memory. Washing up on a nearby beach the next morning (naked, as always) she is taken in by a pair of well meaning college students (who only go to class once during the series; I guess class attendance isn't really a top priority in Japan), Kohta and Yuka. Now let's play a little game; you see a naked, clearly mentally ill girl wash up on the beach without the ability to speak. Do you...
A) Call the police.
B) Give her some food and cloths and THEN call the police. Or would you...
C) Take said naked girl home with you and NOT tell anyone.

If you said A or B then TADA! You're a normal person. If you said C then you are a character in Elfen Lied. YEAH! I know anime isn't a genre where characters always act and talk like real people, but COME ON! Who wouldn't call the police if they found a naked mentally ill girl on the beach? (Other than perverts, that is). Is it too much to expect these characters to act at least somewhat realistically?

And that's pretty much the problem with this show from beginning to end; the characters don't act like real people. The love triangle that's started up between Nyu (Lucy), Kohta, and Yuka, I guess to add a second layer of ""depth"" to the story (you know, give it something other than the whole naked girls killing lots and lots of people) comes off as more of a soap opera than anything else. What person actually asks their first cousin to fondle their breast? YUCK! Every time Kohta does anything with another girl (oftentimes just helping them out) Yuka gets jealous, calls him a jerk, maybe slaps him around, and then runs off crying. Now I can sympathize to a point, but girl GET OVER YOURSELF! It isn't the end of the world if your first cousin isn't romantically interested in you.

But it isn't only that, characters who really are likable and DO have interesting back stories (Mayu for instance) are introduced, and then almost ignored. Mayu had possibly one of the saddest back stories in the whole show, and yet her past was never fleshed out or used to propel the story. I would have loved to see her run into her step father in the streets someday, or maybe she, with the help of her friends, could have tried to confront him. Although the creators of this show get props for attempting such an ambitious story, they get no credit for execution as the whole thing is more disgusting then sad and is not elaborated on during the course of the series. Mayu serves as a plot device for the rest of the series, and it is very unfortunate for the series as a whole because instead they decide to focus on Khota and Yuka who are, quite frankly, uninteresting and boring.

So now for some good stuff. The little Diclonius (the race of horned mutants of which Lucy [or Nye], and Nanna are a part) girls are SO adorable that it was almost impossible to find any fault in them, even when they went on bloody rampages and killed dozens of innocent people. All they had to do was look at the screen with those giant red eyes of theirs and cry a little bit and my heart would break for them. Who knew such sadistic killers could be so cute? Despite my trashing the linier story of this show, the back story for Lucy was actually quite stunning (if a little too convenient). The part with her dog was SO depressing I was tempted to give this show more than two stars, but alas the ending didn't give it any hope of such a high rating. My favorite part, by far, is when Lucy goes to the zoo as a child and is amazed by the size of the elephants and giraffes.
""Oh, it's so big, how did it get so big?"" (Elephant trumpets) ""whow, amazing!"" (Just imagine this in the cutest little girl voice possible).
It reminded me so much of my own childhood, going to the Omaha Zoo (one of the biggest in the country BTW) and begging my parents to let me see the elephants because they were my favorite.

[..] As is, with only a few episodes dedicated to back story, the show could not stand the weight of its own self importance. Nanna was also a pretty interesting character, though at the very end of the show she did get a bit annoying.

The animation for this show was actually quite good; better in fact then most anime I've seen. The backgrounds were quite stunning in their detail and the character designs were oh so cute. The music was pretty plain, although the main theme wasn't bad at all, if a little less impressive then other shows. It's the opening and ending that get on my nerves. More naked girls shuffling around while the camera zooms in on their breast. Don't believe me? It's true. The ending is some Japanese rock song with a still picture of a naked Lucy while the camera slowly zoom in on her left breast. What kind of person does it take to watch that all the way through? I wonder... maybe the same kind of person it takes to give this show a five  star review.

So if you're looking for tragedy, look elsewhere at the shows I've already mentioned. [..], that is unless you're looking for underage girls taking baths together, in which case [..].

Some fan service here and there is okay, I don't really like it but its fine, but THIS MUCH!? How many times do I have to see Lucy (or Nyu, which is her alter ego) shamble around on screen wearing nothing but socks? How many times must I have to see Myu (who's 13 BTW) take a bath with Nanna (who is also 13)? Nothing makes you feel like a pervert more then watching a couple 13 year olds take a bath together for ten minutes.

The show starts off with a ten minute bloodbath as a naked Lucy strolls though the hulls of a heavenly protected government research lab killing literally hundreds of well armed soldiers and guards (and one very unfortunate, very clumsy secretary). She manages to escape (leaving behind a LOT of blood) but is shot in the head, which then causes her to lose her memory. Washing up on a nearby beach the next morning (naked, as always) she is taken in by a pair a well meaning college students (who only go to class once during he series. I guess class attendance isn't really a top priority in Japan), Kohta and Yuka. Now lets play a little game; you see a naked, clearly mentally ill girl wash up on the beach without the ability to speak. Do you...
A) Call the police.
B) Give her some food and cloths and THEN call the police. Or would you...
C) Take said naked girl who can't even speak home with you and NOT tell anyone.

If you said A or B then TADA! You're a normal person. If you said C then you are a character in Elfen Lied. YEAH! I know anime isn't a genre where characters always act and talk like real people, but COME ON! Who wouldn't call the police if they found a naked mentally ill girl on the beach? (Other then perverts, that is). Is it too much to expect these characters to act at least somewhat realistically?

And that's pretty much the problem with this show from beginning to end; the characters do NOT act like real people. The love triangle that's started up between Nyu (Lucy), Kohta, and Yuka, I guess to add a second layer of ""depth"" to the story (you know, give it something other then the whole naked girls killing lots and lots of people) comes off as more of a soap opera then anything else. What person actually asks their first cousin to fondle their breast? YUCK! Every time Kohta does anything with another girl (oftentimes just helping them out) Yuka gets jealous, calls him a jerk, maybe slaps him around, and then runs off crying. Now I can sympathize to a point, but girl GET OVER YOURSELF! It isn't the end of the world if your first cousin isn't romantically interested in you.

But it isn't only that, characters who really are likable and DO have interesting back stories (Myu for instance) are introduced, and then almost ignored. Myu had possibly one of the saddest back stories in the whole show, and yet her past was never fleshed out or used to propel the story. I would have loved to see her run into her step father in the streets someday, or maybe she, with the help of her friends, could have tried to confront him. Although the creators of this show get props for attempting such an ambitious story, they get no credit for execution as the whole thing is more disgusting then sad and is not elaborated on during the course of the series. Myu serves as a plot device for the rest of the series, and it is very unfortunate for the series as a whole because instead they decide to focus on Khota and Yuka who are, quite frankly, uninteresting and boring.

So now for some good stuff. The little Diclonius (the race of horned mutants of which Lucy [or Nye], and Nanna are a part) girls are SO adorable that it was almost impossible to find any fault in them, even when they went on bloody rampages and killed dozens of innocent people. All they had to do was look at the screen with those giant red eyes of theirs and cry a little bit and my heart would break for them. Who knew such sadistic killers could be so easy to sympathize with? Despite my trashing the linier story of this show, the back story for Lucy was actually quite stunning (if a little too convenient). The part with her dog was SO depressing I was tempted to give this show more then two stars, but alas the ending didn't give it any hope of such a high rating. My favorite part, by far, is when Lucy goes to the zoo as a child and is amazed by the size of the elephants and giraffes. It reminded my so much of my own childhood, going to the Omaha Zoo (one of the biggest in the country BTW) and begging my parents to let me see the elephants because they were my favorite. Yes, I'm a sucker when it comes to little girls suffering; probably explains why my favorite shows and Now and Then, Here and There and Gunslinger Girl, and if Elfen Lied had focused on this back story as a focal point instead of the inane love triangle/government conspiracy nonsense Elfen Lied could have very well been a masterpiece. As is, with only a few episodes dedicated to back story, the show could not stand the weight of its own self importance. Nanna was also a pretty interesting character, though at the very end of the show she did get a bit annoying.

The animation for this show was actually quite good; better in fact then most anime I've seen. The backgrounds were quite stunning in their detail and the character designs were oh so cute. The music was pretty plain, although the main theme wasn't bad at all, if a little less impressive then other shows. It's the opening and ending that get on my nerves. More naked girls shuffling around while the camera zooms in on their breast. Don't believe me? It's true. The ending is some Japanese rock song with a still picture of a naked Lucy while we slowly zoom in on her left breast.  What kind of person does it take to watch that ending to its end? I wonder... maybe the same kind of person it takes to give this show a give star review.

So if you're looking for tragedy, look elsewhere at the shows I've already mentioned. Elfen Lied is nothing special, that is unless your looking for underage girls taking showers together, in which case I'd suggest you tern yourself in to your local authorities and get immediate psychiatric help. Good night.

2260367,5,B000929V72,"I respect Mr. Solomon's right to a personal opinion on sex and violence in cinema, but just feel it is inappropriate in an official product review.  For perspective, ""Friends"" has far more blatant sexual content than any broadcast-level anime and was aired in prime time.  Japan airs this type of anime after midnight.

Violence? Yes, Elfen Lied has it.  This is animation created for and intended for adults.  If you don't like David Lynch movies because of the violence and sex, you won't like Elfen Lied.  If you enjoy a well-crafted, offbeat  and unique sci-fi story that includes such content, you probably will enjoy it.  Amongst actual anime fans, it is highly regarded and deserves its rank as one of the best non-mainstream, creative efforts from Japan.

Elfen Lied gets in your face quickly with an unexpected, riveting level of violent action, then carries you forward with mystery.  On the other hand, it has heart.  Behind the obvious violence is a story of an utterly lonely girl, an outcast never intended or allowed to be part of society, who is given a chance by the kindness and care of strangers to discover who and why she is.  What that is just might stand your hair on end, but I'll not spoil it.

In a way that only an excellent storyteller can, Elfen Lied's creators  weave personal and social issues together expertly with a deft combination of drama, suspense, action, romance and comedy.  Anime fans will recognize many of the themes common in Japanese stories, but Elfen Lied is no knock-off.  Those similar elements are often turned on their heads, and what you hope or expect to happen rarely does.

Some of the appeal of this show is the very extremes that draw criticism.  Because without them the show would have failed at confronting the issues it addresses, watering down both the themes and the plot until it faded in with all the mediocre anime.  Rewrite the violence out of Pulp Fiction and see what you get.

Anime is often cheaply produced, but not Elfen Lied.  Production value is very high, with beautifully designed characters and settings, and fluid, high-quality animation as well as excellent music and sound.

I agree it isn't for everyone, but its value is undisputed.  Try Elfen Lied if you aren't put off by sex and violence and are looking for a new, unique show that will engage and entertain you on many levels.  And if you're new to anime, don't expect to see this level of quality often.",1196035200,,2442,4.732227488151659
2260368,5,B000929V72,"I stubbled on this series last year and what attracted me was the box art. On the back of the first disk is this innocent looking girl wearing a guys button down and squatting in a pool of blood. I was interested and it definiately delivered! It is VERY graphic....lots of volence and blood. Also the characters known as diclonious (not sure how to spell) really are creepy.... They did an excellent job with this one. Lots of inuendos and small stuff they squeese in there and I have to say even if it sounds twisted it was beautiful at some points. If you want something cute and cuddley this isn't it!!! This is bone-chilling twisted, and better yet AWESOME! I bought all 4 discs after the first episode I saw. You won't regret it!",1193702400,,734,4.444444444444445
2260369,5,B000929V72,"Elfen Lied is one of those animes that has alot in it for everyone.  It's got romance, it's got suspense, it's got comedy- it's got everything.  You just have to get past the almost constant wave of blood and gore that's being thrown at you to get to it.  Elfen Lied, needless to say, is NOT for the faint of heart.  The effects aren't real, granted (this IS an anime, you know), but they might as well be.  The gore effects, however, are what set Elfen Lied apart from other, more tame animes.  To me, the gorier, the better.  But I digress.

Elfen Lied (German for ""elf song"", in case you wanted to know), begins in a laboratory where work is being done on a new race of genetically-engineered superhumans called the Diclonius- humanoids with invisble arms attached to their backs.  They are the ultimate war machines, for the Diclonius' extra limbs are not only invisible, they travel at the speed of light and slice with a razor's edge- and the opponent doesn't even see it coming.  The scene is ripe for one of these things to break out, though, and break out she does: one of the Diclonius named Lucy breaks free from her bonds and goes on a killing spree throughout the lab.  She is eventually hit by a 50-caliber anti-tank missile, but all that does to her is knock her unconscious; she then falls into the sea.  Oh, and did I forget to mention she's naked? I did, didn't I?  Well, you know now.  And that's just episode one.  Episodes two through four are where it really gets good.  Lucy is found naked on the beach by college student Kohta and his cousin Yuka; Kohta and Yuka decide to take Lucy in, not knowing what she really is.  Kohta calls her ""Nyu"" because that is all she can say at first.  Soon, other inhabitants come to the inn that Kohta runs, including a homeless girl and her pet dog.

Eventually, though, the scientists want Lucy back, so they send out another Diclonius named Nana to get her back.  Nana finds Lucy and gives her the ultimatum: come back with her or die.  Problem is, Lucy doesn't want either of those, so Lucy and Nana begin to fight, which ends in Lucy soundly defeating Nana and using her Diclonius powers to tear her limb from limb.  Eventually, Nana is found by her ""father"" (her creator) and taken back to the lab, where she is put under in order to undergo surgery.  And thus ends episode four and volume 1 is over.

As I stated before, Elfen Lied is a very violent and gory anime; what I failed to mention before was that Elfen Lied is very graphic in another way- not only is there blood and gore, but there's enough fanservice (to put it VERY mildly) in just this first volume to satsify any hentai fan (at least til they get volume 2).  Needless to say, children shouldn't touch this anime with a 20-ft. pole; neither should those with delicate stomachs.  For the rest of us, who can see past the gore to find the real beauty- my friends, this anime is for you.

To end: If I had to pick a favorite character from Elfen Lied, it'd have to be Nana.  She's just so innocent and cute- plus, she can really kick tail.  I cried when Lucy finished beating Nana to a pulp- and if you didn't, I declare you soulless.

It's like someones cheesy fantasy or something. Anyway lack of drama, no characters or plot that make real sense is what kills it for me.

2260376,5,B000929V72,"I watched Elfen Lied the other day and was pleasantly surprised. Numerous people have bashed the anime because there is an awful lot of violence and, often unnecessary, nudity. However, unlike many animations which are simply created for the gore/sexual content, Elfen Lied has a gripping storyline.

At first, many are incredibly embarrassed about watching an anime with such labelling, but after watching the first episode you've been drawn it - hook, line and sinker. The opening theme tune is undeniably beautiful and as the thirteen (fourteen including an addition episode which, or so I am told, is included in one of the four DVDs?) episodes go on, you find that Elfen Lied has a very emotional story line in places. Firstly, without spoiling, is the case of Number Seven or Nana and her relationship with `Papa'. Her undying loyalty is both touching and heartbreaking, as is the misunderstanding between herself and Nyuu.

For people who can overlook the violence and nudity, you'll enjoy this anime. HOWEVER, as with most things, there is a negative side to the anime. While watching E.L, I noticed that Nyuu-chan is awfully like Chii-chan from Chobits - and I'm not the only one to realise.

Never-the-less, this is a cracking anime - neither overly drawn out nor  a surplus of characters. We have Yuka and Kouta (two cousins who act like the parental figures in the house) with the homeless runaway Mayu and her dog Wanta and the two diclonius, Nana and Nyuu (split personality, aka. Lucy)

Aside from dealing with parent/child bonds, fights between split personalities and bullying, the flashbacks are surprisingly believable as they are genuinely reflective of how children are. This anime also raises a question which is often overlooked by viewers. Diclinous are not treated as proper people, two ear-like horns protrude from their heads, making them victims of bullying and outcasts of society. They also have the use of vectors, invisible arms, which makes means they are hazardous to the population and must be contained. As they aren't seen as humans, they're lab rats at the hands of humans and even their own kind.

Overall, (I have to end this mini essay!) this is well worth buying, but only if you can handle the mature content. I wouldn't recommend it under 16s, unless they're responsible enough. It pales in comparison to others of the same nature, mainly because of the strong story line and character developments. The ending of the series is also excellently done.. All in all, this is an animation to be proud of owning.

Fans of this anime may also enjoy Haibane Renmei, from the creator of Serial Experiments: Lain and Texhnolyze.",1155168000,5,2663,4.957399103139013

2260378,4,B000929V72,"I was totally hooked on this show after I saw the first episode.  It's pretty gory, but since it takes different kinds of gore to gross different people out, I'll describe it; people are constantly getting their limbs/heads ripped off, via telekinesis.  In one scene, you see a soldier get his heart punched out through his back.  In another, you see a cute girl very graphically get all her limbs torn off.  This may not be for everyone, but I thought this violence was done really well; it was the sort of creepy violence you get from a horror show, not the loud, flashy violence you get from an action show.

The thing I dislike the most about this show is the ecchiness (the 'perverted' scenes).  There's just tons of unnecessary nudity.  The mutant with telekinesis is a killing machine, under normal circumstances, but after an accident, she loses her memory and becomes cute and helpless; she can't speak, needs supervision from the two youths who take her in, and is always doing perverted things that are just dumb.  Ultimately, behind the decent plot and the great violence, this is sort of a harem show--you have Kouta, a good-natured college student, living with four other girls, one of whom is Lucy, the mutant.

Nevertheless, the show's bad qualities don't outweigh the good ones.  Lucy in particular is a great character.  Whenever her memory returns, she goes back to mercilessly killing anyone who provokes her.  Watching her destroy the soldiers sent out to eliminate her is really entertaining, especially the way she always remains totally calm and expressionless when she's doing it.  The accompanying music is also terrific.  I think anyone who likes violent horror anime will enjoy this show, but again--it's not for the squeamish.",1146873600,,1755,4.905084745762712

2260381,5,B000929V72,"I have the impression that Hiyao Miyazaki's films (such as ""Princess Mononoke"") transcend what is typically referred to as anime, and I therefore plead guilty to being ignorant of the criteria by which anime is evaluated by its fan base. My first instinct has been to criticize the animation itself, which is often so stiff, choppy, and artistically bland that I cannot fully appreciate its plot, no matter how admirable. But having viewed ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and the ""Elfen Lied"" series, I have to admit that frames/second are not much of an issue when the artistry is well conceived and executed. It helps to have a compelling storyline, but anime is first and foremost a visual art, and unless it jumps at the eye in terms of quality artwork (including stylization and palette) and artistic direction, this form of animation, due to its lack of fluid motion, minimalistic approach to facial expression, and occasional still frames, just fails to engage me.

Since ""Elfen Lied"" succeeds on an artistic level, I found myself totally absorbed in the story, though it is almost certainly drawn out a bit more than is necessary. I enjoyed the occasional female nudity, which, by the way, is not very explicit in terms of detail. And as for the blood and gore, it wasn't realistic enough to be considered offensive (in fact, it was kind of artsy in a Quentin Tarantino kind of way).

""Elfen Lied"" has a terrific soundtrack, and its theme song (""Ilium"") is hauntingly beautiful. A female vocalist delivers the theme during the opening credits (which I let roll for all 13 episodes), but, within the film, the theme is also sung by a male choir, is included in the soundtrack as an instrumental, is played on a music box, and is hummed by male and female characters. And no, I never got tired of hearing it!

I know there is some debate as to the plausibility of the characters in terms of their behavior and interrelationships, and I have to admit that at times it was challenging for me to distinguish between certain characters whose appearance was similar, but I am giving this series 5 stars because the ""art"" of it works for me, because I love the soundtrack, because the plot is both interesting and well developed, and because I found the story elements, including the adult content, to be quite entertaining.

The Elfen Lied Vol. 1 Box Set (B000929V72) includes the ""Vector One"" DVD in a nice box that is intended to hold the remaining three vectors which must be ordered separately. Amazon's note about multiple discs does not apply, since only one DVD comes in the box (a cardboard filler occupies the empty space).

The first episode doesn't do much to prove that assumption wrong. It has important foreshadowing that you won't understand until later episodes, but at first glance it also just seems to reinforce the advertising of Elfen Lied as 'look, lots of blood and nudity, buy me!'.

Don't be discouraged by this. Keep watching it, Episode 3 is when the real story arc begins to fall into place.

Elfen Lied is the most beautiful anime I have ever seen. It displays the best and the worst of human nature, and does so in amazingly heartwrenching ways. I can almost guarantee that you will cry at least once, probably more, watching Elfen Lied. Nyu's antics will undoubtedly make you chuckle, and a flashback of Mayu's adoptive father will make your blood boil with rage. Countless other moments (especially the later episodes dealing with Lucy's past) will cause your emotions to run high.

Evoking very powerful emotions from the viewer is what Elfen Lied does. There are several episodes where I found myself needing to stop for a minute afterwards, and soak in what I had just watched.

Regardless, this is still not an anime for children. While there are no sex scenes (hence, 'Elfen Lied' is not a hentai), Nyu's antics are often obvious fanservice, and there is a gratuitous amount of brutal violence, blood, and nudity. That being said, I would recommend this anime to anybody 18 or older.",1139702400,5,1595,4.827838827838828
2260387,5,B000929V72,"Honestly, if you're easily offended like some of the people who wrote reviews of this anime apparently are, don't watch it. If you'd rather be watching something squishy and soft like Ai Yori Aoshi or Love Hina, don't watch this anime.

However, it you can take the shocking violence followed by suprising cuteness, if you can look past the blood and the severed limbs to get to the center of the anime, to the true plot, to the absolute brilliance (and yes, i do think this anime is brilliant), then go ahead and watch elfen lied.

the people who made this anime understand that sometimes hyperviolence is needed to make a point in a society that is already swamped in daily violence, that to make a point of ""this character is actually frightening"", you have to push the limits. and that's what they did. they took the chobits-style cuteness of Nyu and made her share a body with the truly frightening Lucy.

I think one of my favorite parts was constantly guessing when Lucy would reveal herself...

I think in the end her personality of Nyu and Lucy became one again because Lucy showed sad emotions in the end. Hopefully I would like to see a sequal in the future.

2260391,2,B000929V72,"I don't even know where to start with this one - from the various reviews, I was expecting to like this a whole lot more than I did.  It looks like someone wanted to mix the cuteness of ""Chobits"" with the sadness of ""GunSlinger Girl"", but wound up with random plot elements from random Sci-Fi/Action movies, some more random plot elements from random cute anime series, and random pointless nudity and bloodshed randomly sprinkled around for the hell of it (randomly).  It was almost more fun trying to guess where the plot items came from - the opening had (not so subtle) elements from ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""X-Men"", ""Ai Yori Aoshi"", ""Lifeforce"", and ""Mahoromatic"", for example.

The story starts out reasonable enough - various psycho military, mutant, and scientific personnel are dispatched to recapture a homicidal psycho mutant after she escapes from a bunch of psycho scientific and military personnel working in a secret mutant experimentation/torture lab (insert random nakedness and flying body parts here), because they apparently didn't know how pissed off a homicidal psycho mutant can get after being experimented on and tortured in a secret mutant experimentation/torture lab (and were so suprised that they forgot to get their anti homicidal psycho mutant guns).  Unfortunately, all of the poorly done plot tricks (split personality/amnesia bits, poor homeless girls, naked mistreated mutant girls, innocent bystanders - and puppies, for crying out loud) had me paying more attention to ""I wonder what lame trick is going to be used for shock value next?"", rather than whatever the story was supposed to be (and it takes about half the series to get going).

The main story does gets interesting in a few places, and a couple of the minor supporting characters were worth watching, so it gets a couple of stars for that.  If you like random violence and bloodshed mixed with random fanservice and not much of a plot, then this is worth a rental look (along with the better stuff the plot items appear to come from), but the title is definitely below average.",1133913600,8,2077,4.988439306358382

None of it is unneeded, as you'll see while you watch it. It all fits in with the story and the mind-set of the characters. Elfen Lied is, in the end, a well written anime, one I'd recommend to adult fans, especially if you liked Gantz, Blood, or Ninja Scroll. (Note that none of the episodes contain any graphic sex scenes, so this is not adult animation. Definately for those of you 17+, though.)",1129680000,26,563,4.271028037383178

If you read the subtitles for the song the words are quite calming and peaceful but as soon as it goes off and the first episode starts here comes the blood. This series will most likely remind you of geo-breeders or chobits but with a lot more violence to me it even exceeds gantz.

The story is simple humans becoming mutants but unlike ninja turtles these mutants are cute. On the first episode you might be confused into thinking that the mutants are telekinetic but will find out differently in the second episode. A company which had a bit of control on one of the mutants also known as lucy or nyu lost total control and this sparks a complete massacre of  security and inoocent workers. During lucy's breakout she looses all memory due to a shot to the head and develops a good side bad side.

The bad side is when lucy remembers who she is and basically becomes evil and wants to destroy all humans. With these types of series it's common for the lunatic killer amnesia crazed character to find some innocent people to live with and lucy finds two teenage cousins. Elfen lied to me is done with beautiful animation and storyline. There is a big caution I very much understand that this series is a little overboard with nudity and gore and will get to some people, and I wouldn't get the import if I were this easily sickened.

Definitely a good pick if you like a good yarn. NOT a kid's show - so don't let Nyu's cuteness trick you.",1127692800,5,531,4.096153846153846

2260397,1,B000929V72,"On very, very rare occasion, an anime comes along that masterfully meshes both the charmingly saccharine and the gorily dark. Chobits is perhaps the best example, although it leans far more towards the sweet side. The much longer list, however, is the pile of shows that attempt this and fail miserably-the highly nauseating Elfen Lied can now be added to such a list. The gore is so plentiful and blatant that it reaches a Kill Bill-esque absurdity, and yet heavily lacks the innocuous, eerie fun of that movie. What's disturbing is that the show also contains moments so sickeningly sugary, they could make a 3 year-old cringe. The first episode opens with an entirely nude Lucy, a mysterious pink-haired girl who escapes from a science lab while humming a church choir-like tune. She proceeds to escape while vilely murdering each and every being that gets in her way. This series pulls no punches when it comes to violence-there are blood-soaked corpses, graphic decapitations, and severed, tattered body parts aplenty. After effortlessly killing over 20 people with what seems like telepathic abilities, Lucy is finally shot and falls into the ocean. She is washed ashore as Nyu, a wide-eyed, clueless, and childlike girl who can't say anything but her name (she's basically a Chi clone). She is found by bumbling cousins Kohta and Yuka and cared for as a pet might be. After peeing on his floor and breaking a seashell his late sister gave him, Nyu leaves Kohta's home in tears at seeing his reactions to her actions. And yet this nondescript, bland young man develops an inexplicable attraction to this killing-machine-turned-teary-eyed-innocent and decides to take off looking for her. We soon learn that Lucy/Nyu is a diclonius, a genetically-created mutant which differs from humans only by its odd catlike ears and multiple invisible hands called vectors, which can easily kill a human with slight movements. Cocky, misogynistic army member Bando goes after Lucy, only to have his eyes and arms ripped off. A homeless girl named Mayu attempts to help him but ends up finding and befriending Nyu. The army decides that the only hope of defeating Lucy (who changes to Nyu and back at seemingly random moments) is to send another diclonius after her. The only other one in their possession is Nana, a girl who has essentially been enslaved by the army for multiple unexplained but gruesome experiments. She takes on these painful challenges with a smile, mainly because of the support of a man she believes to be her father. She is willing to capture Lucy but does not want to kill her. She finally finds Nyu (who eventually changes into Lucy) and tries to casually walk her back to the army. Lucy is obviously unwilling to go, but bizarrely hesitates to harm Nana. This does not last long, and though Nana has longer vectors than Lucy, her frustrating lack of a backbone causes her to suffer a horrifying, depressing death by the hands of Lucy, which is excruciating to watch. Lucy's actions are so nauseatingly vicious, it shatters any possibility of the viewer developing an attachment to the innocent but ultimately annoying Nyu. Elfen Lied takes a very Love Hina/Tenchi Muyo-like turn when Yuka, Nyu and Mayu all end up together in Kohta's house and discretely fight for his affection (much embarrassingly overt T&A display pursues). There is a predictable, half-assed love story between Kohta and Yuka, but the attempted romantic tension is numbed by the overwhelming, bitter violence and a storyline that continually mistakes pointless, inane events for depth. The characters are too insipid to develop anything worth watching anyway. There's more than enough daft violence and unappealing, tasteless toilet humor to earn the rating. But the series contradicts itself to no end, as vapid Sesame Street moments (and a tackily bouncy ending theme) try to moderate the more extreme aspects but just end up violently conflicting one another and leaving the viewer sickly overwrought. No matter how you look at it, the whole premise is kind of miserable. It combines every bad anime clich imaginable, making this an utterly unappealing show. In other words, Charles Solomon summed up this trash bag of an anime perfectly.",1126396800,7,4231,5.028490028490029

2260399,5,B000929V72,"The series opens with a bloodbath. The central character, Lucy, escapes from her incarceration in a scientific lab, and wipes out most of the guard on the way. And of course she's stark naked throughout this scene.

A sniper's bullet fails to kill her, but instead causes her to revert to a childlike personality, Nyu. She's found by a pair of cousins, who take her in.

The science lab want her dead, because she's too dangerous. Meanwhile, the cousins are trying to help her while figuring out where she came from.

While its easy to focus on the gore, or the nudity, I found both to work well in the story without being overly exploitative. It definitely has less fan-service than titles like Burn Up, Ikki Tousen, or Divergence Eve. The violence is pretty strong, and definitely will make the faint-of-heart feel uneasy. But to focus on either the violence or the nudity overlooks a strong and compelling story.

The story really seems to be a tale of Jekyll and Hyde. Should innocent Nyu have to suffer because of Lucy's crimes - even though they are the same being? What makes Lucy so ruthless? Added to this mix is the sexual tensions between the cousins, further complicated by Nyu. Finally the science lab is up to something...

There are several similarities with other anime series. In particular, it is almost impossible NOT to draw similarities between Nyu and Chi from Chobits. Both are total innocents, who are named for the primary thing they say. Nyu's horns even physically resemble Chi's interface ports.

For those of you who say the basic premise is that of a harem show, or that there are traces of one in there-have you actually seen any harem shows? There are certainly moments of romantic tension, but nothing that could even come close to Love Hina or Tenchi Muyo. Mayu does not have the hots for Kohta-and there is no evidence of that ever occuring in the series. Nyu (or Lucy) does, but they take the time to explain that as the series progresses. As for the nudity....nudity is only tasteless when it doesn't assist the story; all of the instances of nudity in this series help the story develop in one way or another. (and if you're going to complain about nyu being nude on the beach...well, she was nude when she left the facility, wasn't she? If she'd had clothes, it would've made the story less plausable) As for the violence...Shinji decimates the entire world in End of Eva; Berserk is full of bloody fights; believe it or not, there is anime that is bloodier than this, and a lot more movies that are bloodier than the said anime (and it's only animated violence, and less than in a Resident Evil game. In short....comparatively, the violence is fairly tame).

This anime has definitely got me hooked, and impatiently awaiting the second volume.

It is true that elfen lied has several cliche' based themes such as the ""harem"" which consists of :a distant cousin, an amnesiac, and a young homeless girl(although a homeless grade schooler doesn't exactly count as harem material in my book but hey maybe i'm not a sicko,who knows...),the amnesia struck helpless girl with evil dual personality, and weak male lead are occurrent in this anime they do not hinder its artistic quality. The plot is actually very deep and while i will not give any spoilers, i will say that the story greatly evolves in plot content and story as it progresses.

 Now that my angy ranting is over i will discuss the wondrous anime that elfen lied is. The animation is beautiful and crisp. There is a definite difference in the styles of lucy and nyu who share the same body, and in the younger characters and the older ones. Some may say that this is a bad thing but i personally thought it was a great idea. The thicker lines in the younger characters(and nyu) and the thinner lines of adults(and lucy)was a splendid idea. The music which consists of several uppity tunes and many dark ones is very deep and equally stunning. The opening is very artistic and the theme played during it is absolutely beautiful. several renditions of it are played throughout the anime in very appropriate places. The ending has a nice tune though i am not exactly fond of the backround image used. The story as i have said is very entrancing and you will be hooked. It has an underlying them of the evils of humanity. Very interesting.

 Now lets talk about the cons of this masterpiece. First off the brutal violence wasn't as bad as i thought it would be, but i warn you it is not for the one with a weak stomach! The gore is definitely beyond puddles and it is not held back. At times it may seem excessive but mostly its right on cue. And of course theres the nudity. In the opening there are some images that show nyu/lucy nude but it is in a very artistic way, not perverted. In the actual anime the nudity can be gratuitous in some episodes i would not consider any of it hentai or perverted. it is done in a very realistic way to convey the childish helplessness of nyu.

 All in all i must say this anime is a great work of animated art and makes up for every flaw with a tremendous story ,musical score, and quality visuals.

2260404,5,B000929V72,"First of all, I'd like to say that I always get mad whenever I see somebody giving a negative review of this series; to me, its a masterpiece.

  You just have to look at the opening theme to realize how different and original this series is.  ""Lilium"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life; I know lots of people write all these great things about the opening in their reviews, but trust me: you have to see it for yourself to understand; It's very artistic and it blows away anything I've seen before.

  I think the characters are full of life.  I've read a lot of reviews with people complaining about the characters and crying about how they don't behave like people would in real life, or how displeased they are by their personalities, their actions, or the situations in the story.  What do they mean by that?!  I don't know what world they live in!

I don't understand how they can complain about stuff like this.  I think one of the things that give so much life to Elfen Lied is how the characters are so different from each other, and how just like in real life, although some characters are similar, some others act in completely different ways that the others could never understand (Anyone been through a real life experience yet?).

I mean, seriously, if you don't like the characters it doesn't mean the story is bad; if you don't like the characters, it just means you don't like the characters! don't be saying all these stupid things about something as beautiful as Elfen Lied just because you can't handle the story or the contents of it!

  So finally, what causes so much controversy about Elfen Lied?  It's mainly all the nudity and the violence.  If you are an open minded person and you agree and/or are aware that: A) There's nothing wrong or shameful about the human body.  B) In real life, people die; sometimes in very gruesome and violent ways; and C)For some crazy reason, in real life not all people think and act like you, and sometimes they do really messed up things, then I would bet anything on the fact that you WILL love Elfen Lied.

On the other hand, if you are more on the conservative side and are into animated features, there's still a world of choices for you; go watch the Care Bears, Dora the Explorer or any of them American Disney movies; you'll find all the happiness and wishful thinking you could ask for :).",1118275200,3,2386,4.479166666666667

The premise of the show is clearly laid out, at least for how far we are into the series, but I'm sure there will be a bigger plot opening up soon.  Volume 1 is full of violence (Very bloody, but thats the way I like it), fight scenes, emotional scenes involving past experiences with dieing family members and forgotten promises, and romantic drama.  The last reviewer clearly did not like the series, but I find many faults with his reasons.  Fan service, which he calls happening when Nyu is naked does not match the definition.  Her being naked is relevant because it is showing her child-like innocence in the form of Nyu, contrasting it from her violent form of Lucy.  Not only that but she is really not naked that often and when she is I don't know why top half frontal nudity would piss someone off so much, the last review seems to be obsessed with that fact.  It is difficult to create a show that does not have anything in it that has been done before, there is a lot of material out there to compare it to.  The fact of the matter is you have to look at how it is done and executed in the series, and here it is done very well.

2260407,3,B000929V72,"I found Elfen Lied through a parody comic at [...] The site is not for the feint of heart, much like this series. Distrubing, to say the least, I had to find out what Elfen Lied was all about to inspire this twisted little strip, Nana's Everyday Life.

As many other reviewers have stated, Elfen Lied contains a great deal of gore. People getting torn apart by the vibrations and ""vectors"" of a mutant race can get rather messy.

The series has no problem seeming to kill off side characters where I thought we would be getting another main character. In the first four episodes, there were at least four characters that the story seemed to start to focus on. Then, before I know it, they are headless or split in two. Unlike other anime's where little snippets into other people's lives usually dictates a side character or a strange encounter, EL supports the blood thirst of the mutants and their disregard for human kind. I felt a bit chilled, I must admit, when a character is cornered or Lucy, with her vacant look and even steps, is heading towards a group of victims. I give Elfen an applaud for this unexpected feelings in a veteran viewer of such series.

On the flip side, there are the humans Nyu/Lucy are befriending. Thus far, we have an forgetful and bumbling, but cute boy and his girl cousin who's got a sweet little childhood crush. I think I choked a bit when I thought the puppy might be dead that belongs to a little homeless girl. The household is, at the least, cutely dysfunctional.

The characters, though, seemed unrealistically to fret over the littlest things and the government seems, while very interested and intent, to not be realistically seeking our their lost Lucy. Its just hard to really connect with any of the characters for this reason (other than the random victims). I like the stark contrast between killing mutants and sweet japanese students, but the realism of reacting and ""hiding,"" the lack of communication and honest expression is hard to believe, even for japan.

Thus far, its a fun series that I will watch again and want to see the rest but doesn't rank in my top ten anime's for sure, and I'm partial to a bit of gore mixed with a bit of cute!",1118016000,9,2198,4.568527918781726

- catgirl cliche: True, Lucy is not a ""catgirl"" persay, however she possesses metal headgear that have the appearance of cat-ears, AND she can only say ""nyu"" which sounds quite similar to a cat.

- naked, amnesiac found in remote place: Oh, joy, naked boobies and fanservice. Been there, done that, seen better examples.

- innocent seeming young girl is actually a violent killing machine: Usually, this is something that girls with guns anime (Noir, Gunslinger Girl, etc.) cover, but I guess they decided they might as well throw it into this mess of an anime.

In response to the comments on Kouta, the main male character: he is viewed as weak and not ""all there"" for a reason. As the series progresses you will understand. Everything does, indeed, fall into place. Now if you still believe him to be unnecessarily weak after viewing the entire series, your opinion will be respected in my book because you are well versed.

And as many have stated, yes, this series is not for the faint of heart. And for those who are unable to appreciate the underlying storyline that is exemplified with scenes of innocense and nudity, malice and bloodshed, and ""airheadedness"" and suppressed pain... this series will be lost to you.

Otherwise, it is in my belief that you will truly enjoy this series.",1117152000,11,989,4.738372093023256
2260410,5,B000929V72,"This a great but short series. The first episode will either turn you away, and/or make you come back for more, the rampant death can be pure shock value. The violence is gory, but clean in that vector hands always seem to cut like a laser. Just imagine if a lightsaber could exist, but didn't instantly cauterize the wound. No one is spared, women and children. Topics like pedophilia, incest, Thats a warning to those curious.

Storywise, you wonder which characters will survive sometimes, and at others, you'll be laughing because you didn't expect a situational joke. The first episode, is a grabber. If you want to introduce this series to squeamish people like me, then, introduce them to the 2nd episode first. You can go back and show the 1st episode as memory, and filler information.

On the note of quality, the animation seemed to have a good budget, or at least good directing. Stills of backgrounds are reused in rain, and music to set the mood, and saved money for what really counts: character movement, battles, etc.

The Latin intro is beautiful, because you don't normally hear a dead language in music, unless you do follow it. The outro song, just doesn't seem to fit, it feels too upbeat, making it feel cynical. The diclonius characters make you think of catgirls in previous anime, but does its job in the purpose of distinguishing who's who.

The fact that you have a diclonius, who regresses back to a child-like state in-and-out reminds you of other anime in general. It feels done before, but the only catch is, it's not the main character. It's because the main cast interact better and isn't (completely) centered on Kouta. If the character had black-and-white personality, throw in a dark past and voila, you have something memorable. You have a blood-thirsty mercenenary, murderous Lucy, innocent Nyu. A bright sunny day, or a dark rainy night. Its simplified, with these sharp contrasts, until you remember their darkened origins. These contrasts and situations all seem to exist just to test Yuka and Kouta's relationship.

For entertainment value, this was well presented. Without the budget, the allowance of nudity and violence, I don't think this would've stood out. At times, I do agree, that random characters were added just to add fuel for melodrama.",1116892800,2,2293,4.9147286821705425
2260411,5,B000929V72,"There is no anime more deserving of this honor than Elfen Lied.

In Elfen Lied, we get to see many VERY VERY VERY disturbing, shocking and repulsive scenes:

- a pre-adolescent Mayu was stripped naked and sexually abused by her own stepfather for a few years before she ran away from home at the age of 13.

-a bully kid smashed the dog's skull, killing the dog in front of Lucy.

- pre-adolesecent girls were seen naked in some scenes. (9 or 10-year old Mayu forced to do a striptease in front of her stepfather. A pre-adolescent Lucy stepping out of the bath with no clothes. And another pre-adolescent girl who had infected Kurama with her genes wore a birthday suit)

- you could see the bones in the center of the circles of the limbs and fingers.

- lots of dismembering, flying body parts and exploding bodies.

All of the scenes I've seen are from a pirated copy of the original, unedited Elfen Lied. I'd not be surprised if the American distributors omit those scenes out of it. They're too conservative or that.",1116806400,5,1021,4.516304347826087

8056548,4,B000929V72,"Elfen Lied is a very violent and shocking show. The first episode especially was aimed to shock and disgust the audience. And while there is more violence and nudity throughout the show, it is never quite as bad as in the first episode. This is not one of those sadist shows like the Saw movies. There is a cohesive plot and some interesting sci-fi elements as well. But to get to this content, you'll have to overlook the graphic nature of this show and its slight harem-anime tendencies  It's by no means a masterpiece, but it's worth watching.",1308009600,,546,4.571428571428571
8056549,4,B000929V72,"First, a warning. This is absolutely not for children!! Aside from the nudity and some mild sexual content, this is one of the bloodiest, grimmest anime ever. We watched it on demand first, so we knew what we were getting ahead of time.

If you're not sure about watching this anime, I suggest watching the first seven minutes of the first episode. This is the most brutal opening for an anime ever, with scores of fatalities, a vicious slaying, loads of automatic gunfire, blood, blood, and more blood (including an animated bloody handprint), and most of the violence is perpetrated by a naked girl by unknown, but later revealed, means.

The entire storyline is very, very sad, even heart-wrenching at times. There are some lighter moments, but they serve (as they should) as a further contrast to the melancholy of the rest of the tale. As you find out what led up to the beginning of the anime, and learn more of the characters' backstory, shock piles on shock, until you find out the truth behind it all.

The story is very complex, and in fact hard to follow at times. The reason I only give it four stars is that the ending seems a bit rushed and ambiguous, and doesn't follow the original manga. Still, it's very enjoyable, and a helluva ride!",1304726400,,1252,4.605381165919282

8056552,5,B000929V72,"Being a horror fan, anime rarely interests me with these over done demon stories. I mean come on, where are the zombies, mutants and other ghoulies you cringe about in the dark?

When a former ""friend"" recommended this I was in part skeptical, I thought 'Oh GOD more hackneyed trash'. When the DVD started rolling it was a kick in the crotch from the get go, blood showering the first ten minutes on screen. I saw decapitations, bodies ripped to shreds in midair, and one poor gal's head spun completely off her shoulders meeting the main character which was so off the wall it was frightening.

Elfen Lied is a solid, well paced series which I think would've made a great film in my opinion. The art is top notch as it is beautiful, and the moments of violence are just so surreal in the beautiuflly rendered backgrounds its hard not to look away. I will warn parents, this series IS NOT FOR KIDS!!!! The violence and nudity are much on par with an average 80's slasher flick (though the full frontal is not graphically drawn but still enough to determine the gender), but tastefully done. It doesn't try to be over the top like HOSTEL. It's kind of like GRINDHOUSE, only you don't see chunks flying with every five gallons of blood, lol.

Also the story contains very mature themes which can and will be disturbing to children. Despite all, ELFEN LIED is a great anime through and through. Once I saw it I was hooked, while I don't want to spoil it the ending still feels quite open, but neatly tied together at the same time.

This is definitely at the top of my favorite movies and series, as the very best with Cannibal Holocaust (which had the same impact but in an alternate way) on the very worst (as in I saw it once and am too scared to press play again). So if you want something that is both hauntingly deep and entertaining in an artsy manner, put the kids to bed and watch ELFEN LIED, you won't be disappointed.",1242259200,,1925,4.429378531073446
