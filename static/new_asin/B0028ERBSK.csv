3872504,5,B0028ERBSK,"I've heard a lot of people saying that Grylls' show is set up and fake. To those people, I say fooey! There's no faking a bug buffet or a live scorpion meal. This dude is the best. Don't waste your time with Survivorman or the other impostors, Grylls keeps it reals. Great show!",1290729600,3,278,4.264150943396227
3872505,5,B0028ERBSK,Very entertaining. I love these kinds of movies.  I've been happy with every season so far!,1279929600,,91,4.6875
3872506,5,B0028ERBSK,Great for entertainment. I would probably rather die than do most of the stuff he does...,1279584000,,89,4.625
3872507,5,B0028ERBSK,"We bought this for my Dad, who doesn't have cable tv, and he LOVED it.  He's an outdoorsy kind of guy - the type who can label all the different mosses and trees on a nature hike.  We also watch this with our 4 1/2 year old and 2 1/2 year old, and they LOVE ""the Bug show"" they call it.  They end up building forts and rivers in the living room - whatever they saw Bear do lately.  My husband & I also enjoy this show, and even though you don't know what has been staged and what is real, it is a fun, entertaining and educational show.",1274832000,2,536,3.889908256880734
3872508,4,B0028ERBSK,"Just got down watching season 3 and it was great. I love the outdoors, camping, fishing etc. This dvd makes sense in a lot of ways, maybe I won't kill a alligator or a python but he does have some good ideas on survival. I found all dvd's to be entertaning and fun to watch. Bear looks like he can adapt to any situation and he is not afraid of anything, maybe because he is trained? I thing everyone will enjoy this season.",1264550400,,424,4.120481927710843
3872509,1,B0028ERBSK,"Bear Grylls has a somewhat entertaining show but it is completely worthless from a survival standpoint. I do not like the Title ""Man vs. Wild""? There are enough people going against the natural world already. That title gives nature a bad name, like it is something you must fight against. The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment. All of this goes without even mentioning the piles of dangerous advice given on this show.

In the screen shots of this dvd set on Amzon's own page, you sea a picture of Edward pole vaulting down a mountain. Imagine if you were in a survival situation, and you are stupid enough to pole vault down a mountain, you fall and break your leg, what would you do? Live longer and healthier, do not listen to a word of advice you get from this show.",1262217600,5,1269,4.590308370044053
3872510,4,B0028ERBSK,"I definitely enjoyed the season. I was hoping that the episode with Will Farrell was going to be in it but to my dismay, i will have to wait for the next season. there was a little bit of stagnancy in the situations Bear had to face. a lot of the situations that were left for him didn't pan out as unexpected. must say that the bee-sting in the face on the salt pans was a test of endurance. made it through just as the WILDMAN always does. this season is definitely a good addition to the collection.",1255564800,4,502,4.13265306122449
3872511,5,B0028ERBSK,This is the greatest show on the Discovery Channel by far. Before Man vs Wild I was not very interested in the outdoors but now I'm hooked. I was always in sports growing up and now I want to take that athleticism and apply it to the outdoors. This show has shown me so much of what I have been missing out on in life and I want to get out there and explore just like Bear.,1253577600,9,373,3.857142857142857
3872512,4,B0028ERBSK,"This won't be an in depth review, so I'll keep this short.  And this won't be much of a review of Bear Grylls as an expert on surviving in the wild.  But, I will say these 10 adventures are entertaining, and it shows us parts of the world that aren't too explored....television wise, that is.

Also, there ARE English subtitles for this season.  So, to anybody complaining about the lack of subtitles/closed captions on previous seasons, Discovery does it right with this season.  I'm not sure if there are closed captions however, but there are English subtitles only.

Another thing, be prepared, like always, for a strong stomach for at least some of these episodes.  Some of what he eats is just awful.",1250899200,7,706,4.691056910569106

3872521,5,B0028ERBSK,"This show is so hard to stop watching, because I want to see what Bear does next.
Some of the things he does and eats is amazing.  Never would of thought cleaning out a camel and crawling inside, ugh!  But if I ever get lost in the desert, jungle, or the arctic, God forbid, I will remember what Bear did (hopefully).",1393027200,,317,4.180327868852459
3872522,5,B0028ERBSK,"This was an excellent season, I enjoy watching Bear! His adventures are always absorbing and interesting. Watching his show is better than much of the garbage that is on TV these days, and the kids love watching him too!",1391385600,,220,4.666666666666667
3872523,5,B0028ERBSK,I enjoy all survival shows as well as books. The knowledge you gain from them is priceless just as long as you actually do what you see on TV or read in a book. You learn a lot more by experiencing it yourself.,1391299200,,210,3.9069767441860463
3872524,5,B0028ERBSK,"Loved every minute of it. Bear doing what he does best, surviving in the wild. Amazing and exhilarating to watch. Great show for everyone who loves adventure.",1390867200,,158,4.888888888888889
3872525,4,B0028ERBSK,"And what I mean by that is that is that YES he shows the ugly side of survival - Last time around I saw him eat a raw heart that he just cut out from a wild sheep body that he had found ( cut out ) - RAW !!

Guess I just never thought it all through to that extent. But oh well. Yea a bit shocking but real as it gets !

So if you want to see what it takes to live outside the city life and your local grocery store. Yuppers this show is it ! YUK & LOL : )",1390867200,,456,3.3333333333333335
3872526,5,B0028ERBSK,Bear never ceases to amaze me. The chances he takes really sets him apart from the other survival shows. You're not disappointed when you watch this video.,1390867200,,155,4.777777777777778
3872527,4,B0028ERBSK,"Great show!!  Picture quality is good, makes you feel your there.  The places where they film, encourages one to visit there.",1390435200,,125,4.904761904761905
3872528,4,B0028ERBSK,The skills that Bear exhibit on these e episodes are simply amazing.  Just a great and informative show to watch.,1389139200,,113,4.65
3872529,4,B0028ERBSK,My grandson who is 12 loves to watch this show. It was a very good season 3. He comes over and we will watch it together. I recommend this season 3 Man vs Wild for anyone who likes this type of reality show.,1388880000,,207,3.8372093023255816
3872530,1,B0028ERBSK,He is a fake!!! Would rather watch man woman wild!!! Duel suvival is ok too! Can not man vs wild at all,1388707200,,103,3.727272727272727
3872531,5,B0028ERBSK,This is typical Bear Grylis action. If you like his stuff then get the DVD. Lent in to friends who in turn loved it.,1388448000,,116,3.875
3872532,5,B0028ERBSK,I am happy that I found Season 3 of Man vs Wild. I love Bear Grylls. My dvd collection is finally complete.,1388361600,,107,3.909090909090909
3872533,4,B0028ERBSK,I didn't know how much I was learning from this show until I watched another survival show and found myself thinking what the characters could do to survive. I actually go into the Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness each year so these skills are great to have just in case. Thanks Bear and Discovery Channel!,1384646400,,306,4.685185185185185
3872534,5,B0028ERBSK,"Great show, I wish the quality on Amazon would be a bit better than standart, but i am not sure if is how the show got recorded. overall great tv series",1382832000,,152,3.935483870967742
3872535,5,B0028ERBSK,"Great Season 3, the seaon2 is a lit bit disappointed. But since I am fan of Bear, I will continues to support the show, nevertheless, the show is no longer appear in Discovery. But S3 is definitely worth to buy it out.",1381363200,,218,4.214285714285714
3872536,5,B0028ERBSK,"this is a fun, entertaining show that teaches you real life saving techniques and uses supremely ingenious methods to get out safely.  A thrilling watch.",1377216000,,153,5.12
3872537,4,B0028ERBSK,The reason I didn't give a five star is because you need to know what you doing in order to use the aggressive tactics that Bear Grylls implements in his survival techniques. 80 percent of the time you need to be a professional wilderness survivalist to use his tactics safely and of course he has a safety net of a true emergency personnel oncall at all times when he's out there. Probably the best part of his show is that he's very entertaining.,1376438400,,448,4.409638554216867
3872538,4,B0028ERBSK,"The skills he's teaching are good and mostly doable, but sometimes editing in this season make it seem easier then it should be.",1376006400,,128,4.608695652173913
3872539,5,B0028ERBSK,"Finally my wife and I have found a series for my son that illustrates and condones survival skills in some rather diverse, but hazardous environments.  Bear has become a hero who approaches any of those potentially life threatening events, with a remarkable sense of confidence and coolness.  Thanks for providing a vision of what real men can accomplish.",1370044800,,355,5.103448275862069
3872540,5,B0028ERBSK,"Of course this isn't the best survival advice! I just love encountering different animals and landscapes, listening to Bear's tactics for these different survival situations, and observing the beauty of the the different places he explores!",1368835200,,240,5.694444444444445
3872541,5,B0028ERBSK,I like this site especially in the morning when I have nothing to do and I would like it even more if could watch the 7th season on prime,1367798400,,137,3.7586206896551726
3872542,5,B0028ERBSK,"Our boys LOVE watching Bear and his adventures!  It's wholesome entertainment the whole family can enjoy.  Plus, we learn a thing or two also while watching.",1367107200,,157,5.0
3872543,5,B0028ERBSK,"This show indicates the human capacity to survive failed attempts.  Good and bad (watch the Baja Desert bee) decisions with their consequences.  Mr Grylls lives his adventure in front of us through attempts that fail and attempts that work.  Mr Grylls shares his perceptions pulling us to him into the screen (watch The Deep South).

Apart from eating very peculiar things (anyone with any common sense will eat the closest thing to what they're used to) NOT HAVING INITIATIVE is the greatest killer out in the wild. All other survival shows on DVD promote too much passivity. In some you can watch the man braking down while having THE LEAST INITIATIVE POSSIBLE. This show, together with ""Into the Pride"" just plead to the idea that all beasts have survival instincts, avoiding and respecting the unusual, while man can transcend, lift himself above it.  Mr Grylls' adventures are an invitation for those in a survival situation to keep persevering -- to gain, gradually use and improve their skills until they succeed.

For example there is no way the climbing out of the old Christian dwellings in Turkey may have been staged. Together with the incredible use of vines to climb more than 40 meters of a canyon cliff that lasted more than an hour in the Dominican Republic -- it is clear from the footage the surprise that caught both Bear and the team WHILE IN ACTION.  I had the feeling Mr Grylls may have reached there some of the most critical and terrifying moments of his entire for-real show.

Mr Grylls escapes extreme situations as a super-cat endowed with 999 lives BUT every time putting up the fight of his life.  This show proves the positive feedback loop of TAKING EDUCATED risks to help maintain your stamina.

Now for the teachings -- just think how he almost died in a glacier crevice and yet he keeps going back into those and studies them. Mr Grylls has the philosophy of a true Zen Warrior, enjoying the risks he takes and his ultimate effort down to the most intimate corners of his glimmering soul.  Therefore he never tires.

And I believe he should get credit for poling down the Hell's Canyon in Oregon. Much softer on legs and feet. What people forget is that Bear has incredible upper body strength.",1366329600,,2229,4.716494845360825
3872544,5,B0028ERBSK,Bear is out of control..  Amazing task and I can't believe he actually put himself though these task.. the camera man too,1364860800,,121,4.5

I recommend it to all people who love the adventure!

3872547,5,B0028ERBSK,"Along with Fear Factor, this is cool because I'm fascinated with watching people eat bugs. Call me weird, I don't care. The fact that this is also educational and my husband likes it makes it even better. I love how we spend all weekend watching the episodes.",1333584000,,259,4.531914893617022
3872548,1,B0028ERBSK,"First of all, he has his own camera crew... secondly... the first thing he does when he gets in the wild is search for food... It's sooo fake! And he DOES NOT sleep outside at night. He goes back to the hotel. That is a known fact.  I would not waste my money on any of his stuff!",1313884800,,280,3.8275862068965516
3872549,1,B0028ERBSK,"I am giving this a 1 star review because it amazes me that people watch this show and think it is real and what you are supposed to do in a survival situation. It's NOT it IS a tv show for ENTERTAINMENT value and is full of very good for examples of what not to do in a survival situation. If you tried to do the things that Bear does you are going to die. I am sorry if you have not eaten in days you are not going to climb trees and pole vault off of objects you do not have the strength when you are starving. I have watched him eat things that any person who has been through a real survival course or military SERE course knows will make you sick or give you the ""runs"" (not a good thing when you are already in need of water). So please do not watch his show and read his books and think that you are going to learn how to survive in the wilderness. Get a Military survival manual or one written by a legitimate survival instructor and read that. Now if you want a good laugh and some entertainment then by all means watch the show you won't be disappointed.",1303603200,2,1064,4.0
3872550,5,B0028ERBSK,"Ok, so a lot of people have negative coments about Bear, but to be honest, I don't understand why.

You may not enjoy the outdors but the landscapes Bear is in are just awe inspiring. Its amazing how little I knew about baja, i live right next door and ive been down those roads before but I had no idea how much information I was going to learn about it, just by watching this dvd.

He gives you cool tips that you might never use, which is the central idea of the show but he does it in a very entertaining way that keeps you wanting more.

So i give this show a 5 star review, why? because when you finally compare it with the garbage they have in tv or movies today, this is really an entertaining and family friendly show.

Those of you that don't like it, i think you over react. Its just a man walking through the wild, what did you expect to see? so enjoy it next to a hot cup of chocolate and your dog and you will find yourself smiling right in the middle of the 3rd season.",1295740800,,984,4.030769230769231
