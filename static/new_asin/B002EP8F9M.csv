The work details how the poles are alike and different.  I would have said there is no northern equivalent to the penguins of the south.  Here, they position husky dogs are that equivalent.  Later they report that huskies can live in Antarctica, but nations banned their presence starting in 1991.  I think the work may have purposely ignored all those huskies chomping up cute penguins because they may not have wanted to upset the young viewers watching.

They include the things you would expect: polar bears, the northern lights, etc.  Then again, they didn't speak about global warming and all the damage that will be caused if the caps keep melting.  This may have been a cowardly move.  I do appreciate that they admitted that a British team died trying to locate the South Pole.

Like every installation in the series, this includes human factors for viewers who may find science, and science classes, boring.  It spoke of the walrus in ""Alice and Wonderland"" and Inuit myths.  Still, at one point the narrator says, ""The Natives began to see that many people from the south were trying to find some pole"" and it shows ""North Pole"" written in English, French, Russian, and Arabic.  Now I love multiculturalism as much as the next progressive, but at the time that Europeans were trying to locate the North Pole, I have not heard of Arabs having that same goal.  I highly doubt there a pole stick up North written in Arabic.  So that was some political correctness thrown in for loaded purposes.  If they wanted to be so multi-culty, why didn't they mention the African-American explorer who went North and had his achievements diminished by racist white explorers?

This work was not bad.  However, I have promoted other installations in the series being shown in classrooms.  I would not encourage this here as this installation is too simplistic.",1238025600,,2062,4.801136363636363
