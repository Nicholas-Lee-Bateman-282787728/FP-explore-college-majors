7315276,4,B010O0FNQ6,covers the San Diego scene fairly well for the time frame. Would love to see a documentary covering 1974 to 1985,1470700800,,112,4.380952380952381

7315278,5,B010O0FNQ6,"It's Gonna Blow is a great unique tour thru mid 1980's to the mid 1990's local San Diego music scene .The sound is outstanding as well as the casual photos and the tight videos of what can be thought of today as many of San Diego's  most interesting popular Bands. If you grew up in Dago during these years or you simply enjoy great Music and video's/photos of hard working fun making Rock and Roll Bands I highly recommend "" it's Gonna Blow San Diego""...you will not be disappointed",1456358400,,483,4.426966292134831
7315279,5,B010O0FNQ6,"This is a great movie about the San Diego music scene and the Casbah. I grew up with these shows and expected it to be a highlight reel of my favorite shows. Instead, I learned a lot about how the bands and scene compared to other emerging areas. For instance, I just assumed every city had its share of violent skin heads, I didn't realize we were notorious for the SDSH. It's also probably one of the reasons San Diego became a big bastion of Straight Edge rebellion.

I highly recommend this movie. It's entertaining, funny, great music, and much more than most musical documentaries.",1456185600,,587,4.59047619047619
7315280,5,B010O0FNQ6,"A thorough and exciting look back at the San Diego music scene as it tried to escape the ""next Seattle"" label and become its own. If you loved any of the San Diego bands(RFTC, Boilermaker, Heavy Vegetable, ETC) at the time, it is a great bit of nostalgia. Makes me yearn to find my old converse kicks and old RFTC shirt and go see some more shows!",1456185600,,347,4.1940298507462686
7315281,5,B010O0FNQ6,An amazing look back at San Diego's music scene of the past and so relative as many of these bands and performers are absolutely killing it today. A required watch for anyone who loves San Diego bands.,1456185600,,201,4.45945945945946
7315282,5,B010O0FNQ6,"Absolutely LOVE this film!! Had the pleasure of seeing it 3 times here in hometown San Diego, and picked up something new each time I saw it. Now on DVD, I'm continuing to watch & learn and share the story w/ friends. During the mid- to late-90s I was very aware of the thriving local scene here; but being a teenager, I was hardly able to participate or bear witness to it. I had the albums from bands like Three Mile Pilot, Creedle, Heavy Vegetable, Inch, Drive Like Jehu, etc. (all of which are featured in the film along w/ several others), but didn't realize how little I knew about the backstory of how such a musically diverse and unique local scene came to be. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in underground music, DIY, punk/hardcore, local scenes or just plain ol' awesomeness in general.",1437091200,,815,4.551020408163265
8722828,5,B010O0FNQ6,"I LOVED this film. A really cool historic look at the vibrant SD music scene of the late 70s-90s. I live in San Diego and love music, but moved here in the late 90s - so it was extra interesting to learn more about the musical history of where I live.",1516579200,,251,3.9411764705882355
8722829,2,B010O0FNQ6,It is worth the watch but I expected a lot more. Casbah and John Reis. It's a good place to start. Where was Bodies? Burning Hands? Honey Glaze? I know it cant all be covered but I just wanted more than just an historical overview.,1485820800,,231,4.155555555555556
8722830,4,B010O0FNQ6,Cool - and allowed me to discover new bands,1484697600,,43,3.888888888888889
8722831,3,B010O0FNQ6,"Should have covered the scene from 89-94 because that's when it didn't blow, It BLEW UP.  Way too many bands and venues not mentioned (Too much RFTC), but you get the gist of the SD scene.  And yes, STONE TEMPLE PILOTS WAS NEVER A SAN DIEGO BAND. My. 02",1484611200,,253,4.142857142857143
8722832,4,B010O0FNQ6,"It captivated most of the seen from that time. Very accurate from someone who lived in the area and went to a few of those shows.  The interviews could have been a little more in depth with each band but otherwise, I enjoyed it!",1482624000,,228,4.181818181818182

8722834,2,B010O0FNQ6,"Having grown up in the San Diego scene in the 90's it's not hard to see why this doc failed to reach a wider audience: It's a movie for insiders BY insiders. This myopic viewpoint is, in my opinion, the very reason why SD never blew up. Our indie-rock scene simply lacked the mystique, sexuality, diversity, commerciality, and clear message that cities like LA, Seattle, Chicago, NY and Athens had. Many might say this is exactly why bands like Blink 182, Rocket and Jewel thrived. Most of those left to testify come off as a bit rigid and dry, despite the fact that there are countless vivid, historic stories from SD concerts that could have been illustrated here in a real, tactile way. If I'm an outsider, I want to FEEL what it was like to be here. Old footage runs on too long and  interviews re-hash previously explained concepts, revealing a lack of good digestible visceral content.

The real shining moments occur when Ian MacKaye of Fugazi and Milo of Descendents share their respect for their experiences here. But having gone that far, why not interview Henry Rollins, Mike Ness, or Green Day? Henry Rollins got knocked out, Mike Ness arrested, Green Day sued. All in San Diego. Not to mention countless other stories from bigger bands that lend additional flavor to the overall story of our scene. With critical players left out such as O, Tim Pyles, Al Guerra, and the like, a feeling of suspicion begins to arise. To add insult to injury, the subtle middle finger to Blink 182 at the end really only serves to reveal a somewhat dark vein of spitefulness. Why be that guy?",1479772800,4,1587,4.644128113879003
8722835,3,B010O0FNQ6,"This was an interesting document of the late seventies to the nineties eras of the greater San Diego music scenes. It did an alright job at giving a broad and at times too general coverage of the musical talent. Admittedly, I was hoping the doc would have done more to cover the punk bands, but understand that this is sometimes a difficult task. It is a decent document, and I won't criticize it too much, for the simple fact there really isn't much ""out there"" about San Diego to begin with, so kudos to these compilers, whom without there wouldn't even be this doc. I hope some old punker from that time and place would really do a more in depth exploration of the punker-kind. Maybe someone like the lead singer of the Battalion of Saints, George Anthony could commit to submitting a collection of stories/interviews from the riches of that time??? Wishful thinking, spawned from this well-intentioned, yet shallow coverage.",1478044800,,928,4.770186335403727
8722836,4,B010O0FNQ6,I was not living in San Diego during the years addressed in this documentary but I was on the West Coast and fairly into the music scene. I was aware of some of these bands but I definitely learned a lot from this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1474848000,,244,4.104166666666667
