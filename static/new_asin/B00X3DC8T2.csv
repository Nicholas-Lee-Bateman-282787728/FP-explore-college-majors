8714923,2,B00X3DC8T2,DVD won't play the first 4 minutes of the movie. I was disappointed about that. I gave it two stars since it plays ok after that.,1500940800,,129,4.0
8714924,4,B00X3DC8T2,"In 1958, the comedy team of Dan Rowan and Dick Martin starred in the Western/comedy movie ""Once Upon A Horse.""  It was a commercial and critical failure, and has never been released on video.  In 1968, Rowan and Martin struck gold with the TV series ""Laugh-In.""  In 1969, Dan Rowan and Dick Martin starred in the horror/comedy film ""The Maltese Bippy.""  At long last, it's been released on DVD.  After a few minutes into the movie, there is an intermission.  Rowan and Martin, wearing tuxedos, come out and address the audience directly.  Then, the picture really gets into motion.  (Get it?  Motion picture!)  Set in Flushing (ha-ha!), New York, the bulk of the movie takes place in an old, dark house near a cemetery.  Ernest Grey (Dick Martin) thinks that he may be a werewolf.  The sleazy Sam Spade - I mean, Sam Smith (Dan Rowan) - wants to turn Ernie's werewolf transformation into a show-biz act.

The nightmare where Ernie dreams that he is a werewolf is easily the highlight of the film.  Other highlights include Pamela Rodgers in a bikini, and Julie Newmar in various sexy outfits.  Don't worry about the search for Excalibur - a legendary sword, a jeweled crown or a huge diamond - because that plot device is nothing more than a red herring.  The movie really goes off the rails with the excessive violence and multiple endings.  ""The Maltese Bippy"" was a commercial and critical failure, and was the last time that Rowan and Martin appeared in a feature-length film together.  Still in all, I have a soft spot in my head - I mean, in my heart - for this mess of a movie.  Let Dan Rowan (1922-1987), and Dick Martin (1922-2008), walk together, hand in hand, into the golden sunset of our memories.",1491436800,2,1710,4.621262458471761

8714926,1,B00X3DC8T2,"I am giving this product one star because this on-demand DVD would not play in any of four different DVD playing devices that I own.  If you Google ""Warner Brothers,"" ""Archive Collection,"" and ""won't play"" you will find lots of discussion on the problem with these discs.  I will be staying away from all WB ""Archive Collection"" DVDs from now on.",1469836800,,346,4.655737704918033

8714928,3,B00X3DC8T2,"This flick plays like an Abbott and Costello movie informed by ""Laugh-In"".  The problem is this film is not as irreverent or subversive as a typical episode of the legendary sketch comedy show.  Rowan and Martin do nothing here to diminish their standing as a legendary comic duo but neither do they elevate it.  The film is worth a few laughs but not as many as I expected.  Regardless, I would urge ""Laugh-In"" fans to check it out and to the uninitiated this is not the finest hour for this rightly celebrated pair and they should pursue reruns of the original shows.",1452211200,3,569,4.549019607843137
8714929,4,B00X3DC8T2,"Don't be scared off by the ""DVD-R media"" thing. The picture quality is good and the DVD comes in a real case with real artwork, and a professional label. The DVD has an on-screen menu. The theatrical trailer is included. The film is in beautiful widescreen with vibrant colors and the sound is mono.",1445990400,2,299,4.555555555555555
8714930,4,B00X3DC8T2,"This was Rowan & martin's one attempt to do a movie, they were still doing Laugh-In at the time.
It might be described as zany because it's a strange blend of comedy, horror ( but not really scary) with their unique humour.
Some might find it dated but I enjoyed it , as I had seen it as a kid. The supporting characters are in fine form, Mildred Natwick, Julie Newmar, Carol Lynley and others. It sometimes borders on the ridiculous, such as the kitchen scene , where things get rewound and different characters are the murderers. However, look at the source. Laugh-In  was chock full of one-liners, crazy people and situations. Some worked great, others fell flat.
I was really glad to see it available on DVD, it was WAY overdue. The only complaint I have is...it looks like WB burned the DVD from an old VHS tape they taped off TV. Lots of lines and black marks in spots. If you can ignore this, then by all means check it out. Good for a few laughs.",1441065600,3,954,4.359550561797753
8714931,3,B00X3DC8T2,"I was 20 when I first saw this film.  Back then, I thought it was hysterical, especially with Laugh-In going strong.  When the film starts it is very funny.  Unfortunately, there is so much REAL CRIMES on the news this movie now seems like a documentary.  Rowan and Martin, as always, are a hoot.  Carol Lynley as good but whatever happened to her?  Anyway, I wish I could have given this a better review but at age 66 it's not nearly as funny as it was in 1969.",1438300800,3,462,4.193181818181818
8714932,5,B00X3DC8T2,"If you liked Laugh-In, this is a good movie for fans of the show. It's a spoof of The Maltese Falcon.",1437609600,,101,3.857142857142857
