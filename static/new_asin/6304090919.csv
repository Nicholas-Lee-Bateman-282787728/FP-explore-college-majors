Most people think of ""It's Christmas Charlie Brown"" when they hear about Peanuts animation, but ""What Have We  Learned"" touched my heart even more.  If there's one video that should  be shown in every school in America, this is the one.",950400000,13,325,4.649122807017544

7861835,5,6304090919,We first watched this on TV when my daughter was young. In preparation for a Veteran's Day potluck at church I bought a copy of this video to show to the children in attendance while we were having a separate program for the adults. After the adult presentation many of the adults went into the viewing room to watch it themselves.  Everyone loved it.,1405555200,,351,4.484375
7861836,5,6304090919,"One of the more memorable Peanuts films, but definitely geared toward adolescents and adults rather than to children, this particular film has Charlie and his friends visiting various WWI and WWII memorial sites around France.  It has ""slightly animated"" World War II footage, a clip of an historic speech made by Eishehower as well as an excerpt of a poem by John McCrae.  It's very moving and worthy of being shown every Memorial Day.",1244073600,2,436,4.878378378378378
7861837,5,6304090919,"When I saw this special for the first time, I was seven years old. This was my first introduction to World War I and II. This special, along with a discussion with my parents, really helped me to understand the sacrifices the soldiers made in keeping us free.

It is a real shame that this is not available on DVD. I strongly recommend this special for use in the classroom. This special does not talk down to the children, it shows children real places and events-most of which involve D-Day. Linus also does a very nice reading of the beautiful poem, ""In Flanders Field"".

Charles M.Schulz himself was a WWII veteran and was very proud of that fact. Let us honor him and all the other war veterans by making sure both children and adults see this wonderful special.",1175126400,4,767,4.510791366906475
7861838,5,6304090919,"'What Have We Learned,Charlie Brown,in the Peanuts lore is Charles Schultz's tribute to slain World War 1 and 2 veterans and to D-Day at Normandy beach. The plot is:Charlie Brown himself recalls the events occuring directly after those seen in the film 'Bon Voyage Charlie Brown' in which the gang,ready to leave France,end up camping last night at what turns out to be normandy beach,noted as Linus imagines (seen as animated B&W

battle footage from D-Day)and he proceeds to give a history lesson on the subject. The voice of Dwight Eisenhower is heard and the famous poem 'In Flander's Fields' is recieted. And what have we learned here?Well when I saw this at age eight I learned that war results primarily in one thing-death,for better or worse.

  'What Have We Learned Charlie Brown' is by far one of the more serious of the Peanuts television specials. I wouldn't say it was intended for children and I don't think Schultz intended for it to be. It is very historically accurate and wonderfully directed. It does show without any doubt what Vince Guaraldi's classic jazz score of Charlie Brown shows did for their sequencing. I will say one thing in conclusion-as a longtime Peanuts admirer I found this very frightening as a young child-the imagry is very violent at times and the feel of the story is rather depressing as it revolves alot around death and destruction. So I would think the parents should reserve the privilage of their young child to see this. My opinion is that children over 10 perhapes might better understand the graphic nature of this show. It's very well done but taken so far out of context as the other Peanuts film I'm sure opinions very. I like it well enough now but as a child I didn't watch it much. For the most part 'This Is America,Charlie Brown' from later in the decade were a little less heavy handed.",1115596800,10,1847,4.708978328173375
7861839,4,6304090919,"""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?"" is an excellent video for parents and grandparents to explore and talk about with children.  It will hold the imagination of both young and older children and does justice to the WW II experience.  Schulz himself was a veteran of WW II and worked hard at not giving the war a cartoon-ish feel.  In fact, the short video might frighten some of the youngest viewers.",1001116800,16,403,4.647887323943662
7861840,5,6304090919,"With children of my own now, it's fun rediscovering many of the old Peanuts features with my daughters' fresh eyes. ""What Have We Learned Charlie Brown"" was a popular video in our house, and has proven to be a useful vehicle for cultivating an interest in history in my home.",991958400,20,275,4.52

It is a superb way to teach young children the reason for Memorial Day.....the poem ""Flanders Fields"" is featured and is very moving.....puts a lump in your throat......It tells the story of the battle of Normandy and the men who died there......set in France while the gang is vacationing there.",990748800,17,684,4.947826086956522
