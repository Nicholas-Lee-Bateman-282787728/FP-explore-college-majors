2550766,4,B000F3UACU,"This volume of Masters of Horror is a strange hour-long film by Lucky McKee.  The action centers around two young women.  One is a shy lesbian who works as an entomologist at a natural history museum (Angela Bettis).  The other is a more out-going artist (Erin Brown aka Misty Mundae).  The two begin a relationship but not until the first receives a strange bug in the mail.  It seems to be unlike anything currently known and it is unknown who sent it.

The bug escapes just as the two women embark on their relationship.  Thing really spark between the two even though they are both unsure just how to proceed.  Then one of them gets bitten by the bug and begins to change emotionally.  But while that happens, the other is unaware of what is going on bug-wise.  But the changes escalate and things start to get a little less idyllic.  Eventually their status in their building becomes affected.  It is at this point that we really start to learn what is really going on and why.

This is an interesting film with a good build-up and acting.  The bug is seldom actually seen and we never really get a clear view of it.  But it is the ending that is less than stellar.  After a wonderful start and many tense scenes, the ending is like one of the goofier episodes of Tales From the Crypt (watch it and you will see what I mean).  The film still works but just not in the way one hopes based on the beginning.  Check it out.",1153958400,2,1425,4.333333333333333

It's only a short film. It features Misty Mundae (credited here as Erin Brown, and playing a character called Misty) and Angela Bettis (who appeared in Lucky McKee's (director's) previous film ""May"")

Angela plays a lesbian scientist interested in bugs. Misty is a lesbian student with a huge crush on Agela. Enter the 'bug' which has the habit of impregnating other creatures (including women) and making them breed it's young.

The only down-side was the fact the film was so short. Amazon's ""keywords"" need also to include ""impregnation"" and ""morphing""",1151971200,3,757,5.088709677419355
2550768,5,B000F3UACU,"Two very interesting performances by Erin Brown (Misty Mundae) and Angela Bettis are the centerpieces of this surprising MASTERS OF HORROR entry from director Lucky McKee.  Sick Girl is a full 60 mins and is entertaining and sweet and evolves into a piece that is right at home in this anthology.  The admittedly overacted scenes play well with the indie pop songs that punctuate the soundtrack. Lucky's distinctive touch keeps this from veering into a full on Xfiles episode territory.  The extras give nice insight into the directors personality and history with interesting interviews with Angela Bettis Misty Mundae etc.. The real special effects on display here are the performances by the bugs and the girls also a noticable lack of any CG.

While not up to the level of MAY,Sick Girl is still great and the extras will make you want to seek out if available ever THE WOODS, ALL CHEERLEADERS DIE and ROMAN (dir by Bettis)  This and Cigarette Burns are my two favorite MOH that have hit DVD so far.",1151539200,2,1003,4.77456647398844

2550771,5,B000F3UACU,"* Spoilers *

Ida Teeter is an entomologist who loves her job, but finds it hard to find a girlfriend that accepts it. Being shy and kind of awkward doesn't help either. All of this changes when her co-worker points out a beautiful girl who sketches in their office lobby every day. Ida is dubious, but eventually learns that her name is Misty Falls and awkwardly asks her out a couple days later. Their relationship steadily progresses and they move in together. Before they met, a large, strange bug was sent to Ida by an anonymous source. It escapes, nests in her pillow, and bites her girlfriend. Misty starts to act strangely, but she dismisses it as sickness. Bad idea.

Lucky McKee's Sick Girl was featured as an episode in the Masters of Horror TV series. Despite its short runtime, it proved to be an excellent film. Angela Bettis and Erin Brown were perfect as Ida and Misty. Their chemistry was slightly awkward, but sweet and romantic all the same. I found Ida's old fashioned style and deliberate way of speaking, as well as Misty's frenetic energy, endearing. These characters were unique and surprisingly well fleshed out for the short time allotted to setting up their relationship and their personalities. Their relationship and their sexuality were never used solely to titillate the male audience (as is true with many horror films), but as a normal, heart-warming love story with a deeper meaning than just putting nudity on the screen.

I believe this film is about the demonization of the homosexual lifestyle by the majority of our society.  Each person in the film that interact with Ida and Misty are representative of an aspect of society and their typical opinions about homosexuality. Ida's landlady Lana Beasley and Misty's father Malcolm Wolf (who is also Ida's teacher) represent the political far right, who are typically older people. They disapprove of Misty and Ida's lifestyle and go so far as to do the harm (by depriving them of a place to live and sending them a giant homicidal bug). Lana even accuses Ida of being a pedophile, a typical and false argument of someone opposing homosexuality. Betty Beasley, Lana's granddaughter, represents the younger people in society who typically are more progressive and generally support homosexuality. Betty looks up to Ida and sees her as a good friend. She also views Ida's relationship with Misty as nice and normal. Ida's coworker Max Grubb represents the typical heterosexual male. If her lesbian relationship isn't titillating him in some way, he doesn't really care about it. He disapproves of Misty and Ida's long term relationship and asks crude questions about it. Of course, these characters don't encompass the entirety of the people they represent, but the general majority.

The film ends with both Misty and Ida largely pregnant with thousands of monstrous insect babies and being controlled by the large original insect that infected Misty. This ending puts into reality the fear that people against homosexuality have: that gay people will somehow destroy society if their relationships and lifestyle become normal. This is a ridiculous notion and shown to be so by this short film. I think Sick Girl portrays American opinions towards homosexuality in a concise and symbolic way while portraying realistic and nuanced characters. I highly recommend this film and also Lucky McKee's other films May and The Woman.",1358380800,2,3410,5.028318584070797
2550772,5,B000F3UACU,"Sick Girl is arguably one of the best episodes from the Master of Horror series, sold separately as a single movie by Amazon, with a well-acted drama revolving around a lesbian relationship but less than satisfactory special effects. Nonetheless gay rights advocates should love this one.

The story revolves around a biologist specializing in bugs, who overcomes her shyness, under the encouragement of her colleague, to make advances towards a girl - who she later learns to be her ex-professor's daughter, who harbours a secret infatuation with her and also overcomes her shyness to engage in a loving relationship involving sexual intercourse with her; while she conceals her fascination and obsession with bugs from the professor's daughter, under the influence of her colleague, who fears that the discovery of her secret will scare the girl off, only to have the girl stumbling upon her secret and discovering that they both share the same fascination with bugs, given the fact that the her ex-professor was also a biologist who specializes in bugs, and who, due to his daughter infatuation with his former student, sends her an extremely rare specimen of bugs that when bitten induces a gradual transformation in the victim. When his daughter gets infected, she gradually metamorphosizes and, her lover, likewise, begins to gradually transform once the infection is spread to her, imparting in them the ability to reproduce bug off springs.

This movie speaks loads about the right of lesbians to form meaningful and loving relationships with one another which, may or may not involve sexual intercourse, and their right to adopt children or bear children through the use of artificial insemination from male donors.",1356307200,,1724,5.2202166064981945

2550774,4,B000F3UACU,I have not seen all of the series but I was disappointed with the ones I did of the Masters of Horror. That being said Lucky McKee in my humble opinion is not a Master of Horror.

2550775,4,B000F3UACU,"Masters of Horror: Sick Girl (Lucky McKee, 2006)

I've been a fan of the Masters of Horror series for a while, but one of those I've never been able to track down until now is the one I always figured would be my favorite, Sick Girl. Lucky McKee is one of those artists who makes far too few pictures (in fact, if you consider Sick Girl a short--it weighs in at exactly sixty minutes--McKee has directed only three features, and co-directed a fourth, since he burst on the scene in 2001), and since everything he releases is a gem, that can be frustrating. Put McKee and Angela Bettis together and every time, at least so far, the result has been magic. Really, there was no way to go wrong with this. Then I popped it in, once I'd finally gotten my hands on a copy, and I see the name ""Erin Brown"" go by. And I start thinking, ""why does that name sound so familiar?"" And it just wouldn't come to me. Then, a few minutes later, I see one of the most downright beautiful women in all of film, and it's as if someone had wheeled in a huge cake and strippers had jumped out of it, right in my living room: LUCKY MCKEE IS DIRECTING MISTY MUNDAE! (Erin Brown is Mundae's real name.) Misty Mundae, the most beautiful softcore star on the planet! Honestly, I can't even begin to imagine a better definition of ""all's right with the world"" than that.

Plot: Ida (Bettis, who teamed up with McKee in May), an attractive but socially awkward entomologist, has just had her most recent girlfriend break up with her because she was ""really creeped out"" by Ivy's menagerie of pet insects. Ida's landlord, Miss Beasley (Marcia Bennett, who's appeared in both of McKee's features since this came out), isn't happy with them either, though her granddaughter Betty (Presumed Dead's Chandra Cain, cute as a button) thinks Ida and her bug collection is the bees' knees, no pun intended. (Betty has a thing for dressing as a ladybug; it's rare you'll see her dressed in anything but a ladybug costume in the entire movie.) In any case, Ida is girlfriend-less, and her jock-macho-chick-obsessed co-worker Max (Jesse Hlubik, another McKee veteran, who most recently teamed up with the director in Red)'s advice isn't helping much. Max does, however, get her to work up the courage to approach the odd, seemingly shy artist who spends her days in the lobby of the building sketching things. While said artist seems just as nervous and socially awkward as Ida, she eventually introduces herself as Misty (Brown), tossing off a self-deprecating ""I'm not a hippie!"" afterwards, and the two of them end up making a dinner date. Magic happens. However, just before magic happens, Ida is sent a mysterious package from Brazil containing a kind of bug she's never seen before. She means to take it into work and have Max take a look at it to see if the two of them can puzzle out what it is, but it gets loose. And, this being a horror flick, it is of course no ordinary bug...

As I suspected, it's impossible to go wrong with Lucky McKee. It's even more impossible to go wrong with a juxtaposition of Lucky McKee and Misty Mundae, who despite being known for appearing in bad softcore movies, does have some pretty solid acting chops when pushed to do something with them (as she is here). Sean Hood (currently writing the Conan reboot)'s script is overflowing with black, black comedy and features the kind of fountains-of-gore climax that you can't help but laugh at while being repulsed by; it's easily his best work to date. Sick Girl is some kind of perfect storm of creativity all coming together at once. This has been the case with a number of Masters of Horror episodes (when was the last time Joe Dante directed something as good as Homecoming, or Billy Zane act as well as he did in Imprint, for example?), but Sick Girl stands out even in a high-class crowd. As much as I loved Argento's Jenifer, this one's even better. ****",1281052800,,3909,4.573466476462197
2550776,3,B000F3UACU,"Although this entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" series is very light on chills, it followed the formula of other installments from Season 1- Deer Woman, Pick Me Up, Haeckel's Tale, Dance of the Dead etc and it delivered on being goofy. Argento's ""Jenifer"" differed in that it counteracted it with insanely grotesque and disturbing moments, this one, is surprisingly mild. If the gratuitous bare breast scenes were omitted, ""Sick Girl"" could have been a PG-13 rated Sci-Fi comedy that may please some but infuriate those who are in need of thrills, chills and graphic horror. With that sad, this quirky entry is highly watchable thanks largely to the over the top performance of Angela Bettis who plays a gentle but nerdy entomologist who is in search of love and just when the perfect girl (Erin Brown) enters her life, a mysterious insect (who was sent to her via mysterious circumstances from Brazil) infects the girlfriend thus jeopardizing the relationship and their very lives. There are a few moments of slimy gore and the climax is decent enough however more was needed to make this truly frightening. I will admit, I am not familiar with Lucky McKee's work. Maybe if I had watched some of his previous work, I would have known what to expect from this. As I already mentioned, Bettis' performance is what kept me entertained. She puts everything she has into her peculiar character in need of love and acceptance and her quirky accent and tone just adds to the fun factor. Brown's performance is not as memorable but she isn't bad either and it's not her fault her character is a little lackluster however since she does become the insects feeding ground, she has the opportunity to make her character a bit more interesting and she does.

""Sick Girl"" is a twisted mix of Sci-Fi and comedy with little to no suspense and no real scares. It does offer some mild gore, insect FX and mutations, truly ridiculous characters and a love triangle involving an unlikely threesome. It may not scare you the way you expected but you may find yourself being entertained regardless. Not the best of the series but not the worst either and if you are a fan of Angela Bettis, you definitely want to give this odd little love story a try.",1257897600,,2230,4.717948717948718
2550777,5,B000F3UACU,"Others may have their favourites, but this one is mine! It has no boring elements in it anywhere, Angela Bettis is superb as the quirky entemologist, even better than her performance as the title lead in ""May"", (another good movie to watch if you haven't already seen it) but the star of ""Sick Girl"", for me, is the cutest little green leaf bug I have ever seen; witness him waving his little arms around as though in a greeting, so sweet! This episode has everything, interest, originality, great sets, great effects, quirky lesbian relationship, and insects; most of all, that sweet little leaf bug, a star in his own right! Delightful.

Other good ones in the series, for different reasons: ""Imprint"" and ""Haeckel's Tale"".",1211846400,,725,4.846774193548387
2550778,1,B000F3UACU,"It's a common flaw for the MOH series: you're tossed an idea that wouldn't make for a bad little horror story, but the execution is ruinous and the tension is deflated by a running time that's forty minutes too long.  Take ""Sick Girl,"" for example.

An entomologist who has a bad habit of taking her work home with her loses in her apartment a bizarre Brazilian bug.  This happens at about the same time that she finds an equally bizarre girlfriend.  The two sexy ladies frolick and cavort, but one of them has an encounter with the AWOL insect, an encounter that leaves her ... altered.  What fate lies in store for the lovers?  What will become of the strictly conservative granny-ish landlady?  The lovably sexist coworker?  The adorable little girl in the ladybug costume?

This horror-less gem takes an hour to answer these questions, and by the time they're resolved, it's hard to remember why you were ever supposed to care.  Adding to the mix of Reasons Why This Thing Bites is the incompetent acting of our two lesbian leads.  I'll admit I know little about horror veteran Erin Brown, but if her performance here as Misty Falls is any indication, she's very good at moaning, screaming, and looking through her bangs in a sultry, come-hither kind of way.  And that's all she's good at.  Angela Bettis was great in ""May,"" but she performs every scene here with the studied grace of a telephone pole, and she delivers every line as if she just underwent orthodontic surgery.  If those idiosyncracies are meant to be intentional, then I guess at least they're employed with some consistency, but I found them grating.  They are to acting what constipation is to reticence.

Worst of all, however, is the tongue-in-cheek attempt of the movie to make a sly little statement about true love, about infidelity and dedication, and about the supernaturally wholesome power of childbirth and rearing.  I'm known for reading too much into things, and I (really really really) don't want to give the MOH overlords any more credit than they're due, but there was so much empty space in the script that they had to fill it with something.  Instead of tension, spookiness, or dread -- y'know, stuff you'd expect in a horror -- there's a lot of pablum about relationships and dating.  It doesn't take much of a leap to see there's a theme at play, and it's as flat and uninspired as every other part of the product.  I'm not saying I disagree with the message (such as it is), but the delivery needs some serious work.  Or maybe just an econo-sized can of industrial-strength Raid.",1193529600,5,2573,4.7114093959731544
2550779,5,B000F3UACU,"Really enjoyed this somewhat bent tale. Effects were great, acting superb (loved angela's character) and a very amusing ending.

2550780,3,B000F3UACU,"This was a good episode-- on the surface a light hearted, tongue in cheek spoof, but once it settles in, it becomes clear that this is a macabre, twisted, bizarre piece.

Bettis turns in a terrific performance as an introverted, nerdy lesbo scientist who becomes involved with another lady... uh, and eventually some bug from Brazil plays a role in a menage a trois type deal.

If you are into cult horror films with a surrealness, then check this one out. The focus is on the characters and not so much the gore or suspense. A very good entry which would have made 4 stars had it not been for the rushed, punchline ending.",1180483200,,623,4.456140350877193

Misty Mundae)as the two become close lovers. The weird bug however infects Misty as soon it will make her into something completely dangerous and ugly that it needs to feed.

A very steamy and gory little shocker from Lucky McKee (director of ""May"" and ""The Woods"") with terrific acting and a well thought out storyline. There some hot lesbian action here for the guys and excellent make-up effects by KNB EFX (""Kill Bill"", ""Hostel"", ""Army of Darkness""), this is one of the best episodes yet thanks to the genius of Lucky McKee much like his ""May"" movie.

Sick Girl re-unites McKee and his May star Angela Bettis (Toolbox Murders) who plays a bug obsessed entomologist.  After receiving a package containing a very large, and very aggressive, kind of bug the likes no one has ever seen before, she embarks in a heated affair with a shy girl (Erin Brown, better known as sexy softcore queen Misty Mundae) who has a few secrets of her own.  From that point on, a bug bite turns both girl's worlds upside down, especially when one becomes the host and carrier of the bug's offspring.  Offering ample amounts of creepiness and skin crawling fun, Sick Girl is one of the more fun entires in Showtime's Masters of Horror anthology.  Not to be taken seriously one bit, Sick Girl reminds us how fun the horror genre can be when someone just takes an idea and runs with it.  If there's any down points about Sick Girl, it's that Bettis comes off as annoying in her role frequently throughout the episode, but besides that, Sick Girl is a sick blast.  All in all, Lucky McKee's Sick Girl only shows more promise from the newbie horror master, and this installment is one of the better entires in the Masters of Horror series.",1173139200,,1286,4.663716814159292
2550784,4,B000F3UACU,I really love B-movies of all sorts so I was predisposed to enjoy the Masters Of Horror series. This film is another entry in that august collection. It's a twisted take on a romantic comedy featuring lesbians and mutation spawning insects. Lucky McKee is well represented in this quirky little horror/romantic comedy. His previous work (the film May is a prime example) mostly consists of emotionally rending surrealist horror. It's nice to see him going for bigger laughs with this work.,1167868800,,489,5.049382716049383

2550786,4,B000F3UACU,"The Masters of Horror Series has a tendency to over-emphasize the ""Master"" part.  While Lucky McKee may be well on his way to entering that hall, he is by no means a master.  But at the very least, he does direct horror movies.  (When did half these guys become ""Masters of Horror""?  Was I Sleeping?)
  Anyway I loved his first movie ""May"" but never saw his second one ""The Woods""  So I went into this flick with almost no expectations what-so-ever. And what I got was a lesbian love story with a 6-legged twist.  The best way I can descibe it is if ""David Cronenberg"" directed an episode of ""Tales from the Crypt"".
  There's relatively no blood in this film.  (Something I generally need in a horror movie) And yet suprisingly I wasn't disappointed.  The acting was pretty convincing. (Which I think was a good distraction from the lack of gore.) Misty Mundae played the childish, fast-talking, artist Misty, and Angela Bettis seemed at home as the ""stiff as a stiff"" entimologist Ida Teeter.  They did such a good job with their roles, they actually forced me to like the characters.  Even the supporting cast was enjoyable.
  The plot was straight foward.  Lesbian gets a bug in the mail; Lesbian falls in love; Bug bites Lesbians Lover; Lover becomes impregnated with bugs love children and as a result completely flips out of her brain cell.
  All in all, it was a quick story, with good pacing, a few gross out scenes to drive it along, believable acting, hokey yet enjoyable special effects, (I don't know if I mentioned naked lesbians, or not), a hilarious scene in a chinese restaurant, all ultimately leading to its metamorphic ending, which will disappoint some but please most.

2550788,4,B000F3UACU,"This particular episode of Masters of Horror is directed by Lucky McKee, of ""May"" fame.  When McKee was appointed to be a contributor to the series there was some rumblings among the horror contingent.  This is a director, after all who had only contributed one picture to the horror genre so the ""Master"" title seemed a bit of a stretch (Mckee has since directed a second feature film, ""The Woods"", which is currently sitting on the shelf without distribution).  I don't see what the fuss is about.  McKee is an up-and-comer who is clearly devoted to the horror genre.  Eli Roth only has two pictures to his name as well but nobody disputes his place in the genre so let's give McKee a chance...

A lesbian entymologist (Angela Bettis) is sent a package from Brazil that contains an insect that is not just your typical bug; slimy tentacles, long spider legs and a set of peering, intense eyes.  One day she accidentally lets the content break loose around her apartment.  Meanwhile our insect-loving girl falls in love with fellow strange girl Misty (Misty Mundae), a sketch artist who hangs around Bettis' workplace.  Eventually Misty ends up sleeping over at Bettis' place, is bit by the bug and all hell breaks loose.

Bettis is perfectly cast as the lonely, detached scientist looking for love.  Her quirky gestures and personality traits make her truly an interesting actress to watch.  Witness her talking to her bugs for proof of this.  She lends a certain professionalism and skill to a genre that is certainly not known for great female acting.  Misty Mundae is also great in her role.  Mundae has never been know for great acting of course but she is perfectly cast here in a story involving lesbianism and slimy insects.  And yes Misty fans, she gets buck naked.

Mundae and Bettis have a very nervous relationship, which brings an amount of tenderness to this episode.  We truly do care for these characters and feel a deep emotional attachment to them.  That being said, perhaps a little too much time was spent on developing the relationship between the two heroines as there is far more talking throughout this episode than there is chomping (the whole insect-run-amok piece is not unleashed until the final 10 minutes of the flick).  But despite its sedentary nature, ""Sick Girl"" towers above most other episodes in the Masters series due to the strength of its two actresses, the convincing non-CGI bug and the comical absurdity of it all.  Highly recommended.",1155427200,3,2479,4.827014218009479
2550789,3,B000F3UACU,"Other reviews tell you the basic story, so I won't go into that here.  My first problem with this episode is that like ""Homecoming"" and Deer Woman"" it just isn't scary.  This is from the Masters of Horror collection, so I was expecting fear, and it just wasn't there.

  We've seen this type story done before, most notably in Cronenberg's the Fly and Walas's The Fly II, so the new angle is the character's are lesbians.  What they are missing is chemistry.  Why is Misty infatuated with Ida?  Is she the only lesbian she's ever met?

  Performances are all amateurish.  Ida (Bettis) seems to be channeling Joan Cusack on a bad day.  McKee's direction must have been to tell her to talk slowly.  Misty (Brown) in contrast talks fast, running sentences together.  Okay, they're opposites, I get it, but I don't believe (in this case) that they attract.

  I did like the artistic dream sequence and some of the humor when Misty begins to change, but I would think that someone's lover would notice when goo starts spurting out of their paramour's ear.

  The other actors aren't given much to do.  We know who is going to die and they're death's are pretty well telegraphed ahead.

  If ""The Woods"" sees a release soon, we'll be able to tell if Lucky was just lucky with ""May.""

Here's hoping for the best.",1154044800,3,1306,4.569565217391304
8117026,5,B000F3UACU,"It's night and today is (March 24) Mr. Jesse Hlubik's birthday. In celebration, I watched an hour long episode of Masters of Horror which he starred in. It also features Angela Bettis and Erin Brown as the two main characters. It was directed by Lucky McKee. Jesse is the best, he is both cool and hilarious. Angela is always great, but it was Erin who really brought the WOW factor to the screen. She gave a truly excellent performance. The episode was a strange mix of romance, horror and comedy that is creeping with bugs throughout. It's one of my favorite episodes from the series. This was also the first time I have seen a production featuring all four of the awesome people mentioned above, and I have to say that I loved every single minute of it!",1521936000,,756,4.4855072463768115
8117027,4,B000F3UACU,"Well! It seems that one of the lead characters is actually bicuspid, I mean bisexual, you know the one into fairies? The toothsome one? Bicuspids are teeth, so I'm pretty sure the tooth fairy is a gay dentist- ok never mind, getting off track. My point is, she enjoyed the insect's proboscis penetrating her...forget it! Angela Bettie is a dork here compared to ""May"", but I liked it.",1517961600,,384,4.661764705882353

After watching this movie I thought I would give my thoughts on it. It's main actor Angela Bettis who has played in May and other horror movies has become a well know for her ability to fit well in the parts she plays. This film is funny yet it holds to the horror type the Masters of Horror has given us. I totally enjoyed it.",1434499200,,411,4.2025316455696204

8117035,5,B000F3UACU,"Sigh. Angela Bettis is perfect here. As usual, whenever there's comedy involved, she nails it. Lucky McKee let her flirt with caricature here without going over the line, and the performance choice fits with the light, cartoony texture of this whole movie. The love story at the heart of it all is simply adorable. My one gripe is that it is pretty obvious that the Bettis part of an awkward scientist  Ida Teeter, who has not luck with girls was originally written for a man. It's not so much the interactions with love object and creepy girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown, also excellent performance) as with Teeter's fellow scientist, Max Grubb (Jesse Hlubik). The dialogue just doesn't ring true, which I think is more the fault of McKee's writing than Hlubik's actinghe's quite funny.",1421539200,,783,4.843283582089552
