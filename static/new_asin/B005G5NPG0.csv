4689146,3,B005G5NPG0,"The Tintin books, which were successful in their time are now dated and crudely written compared to other literature of the same genre. Even the comic books written today are smoother in their flow and more subtle in their plot devices; however, it is an interesting read for a teenager who might like to see how comic books originated.",1328054400,,336,4.711864406779661

4689148,5,B005G5NPG0,"Nicely timed with the big screen production of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is the release on DVD of this early 1990's television adaptation of Tintin.  Season One contains seven of the original Tintin adventures, including ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", ""Red Rackham's Treasure, and ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", elements of which were woven into the plot for the movie.

Season One also includes ""The Cigars of the Pharoah"", ""The Blue Lotus"", ""The Black Island"", and ""The Calculus Affair"".  All but ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" have two parts, each about 20 minutes long.

The comic characters Tintin, his faithful dog Snowy, and friends Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and the Detectives Thompson and Thomson are well-known in Europe, thanks to a series of graphic novels that have been in print for decades.  This DVD set is a nice capture of the original stories.  The animation style closely mimics Belgian artist Herge's distinctive art style, while the plots have only minor alterations from Herge's originals.  The voice actors for the DVD set were British, but this should not pose a distraction for viewers.  Tintin's boy scout ethics and sense of adventure are TV-safe.  ""The Adventures of Tintin: Season One"" is very highly recommended to fans of Tintin, especially those who might be lookng to introduce Tintin to their children who are too young for the movie.  Release of Season Two is due later in 2012.",1327190400,22,1421,5.060085836909871
4689149,2,B005G5NPG0,"Summary - Poor acting kills a classic

Detail - As a fan of TinTin since I was a boy, I expected more. Although the DVD follows the story line more closely than the new movie, and the animation is very much like the book, the detractors outweigh the entertainment value. Sadly, the quality of the animation is average and the voice acting poor. My children, who generally are tolerant of most of my trips down memory lane and also fans of the boy reporter, disliked it so much they left the room and told me they would rather watch nothing then put up with the acting in this show.

Recommendation - In the end, even through rose-colored glasses of a fan, the best I can say is this is okay to poor. I am disappointed and do not recommend this disc.",1327017600,8,749,4.304964539007092
4689150,5,B005G5NPG0,"My wife knew how much I loved The Adventures of Tin Tin, having read the graphic novels from about the time I was in 6th grade up through present.  She decided to get me season one of the original cartoon adventures as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, and at first I wasn't entirely sure if I was familiar with the cartoons or not, but after watching a couple of episodes it all came back to me!  I remember having watched some episodes on TV at my grandparent's house when I was just a kid, shortly after having gotten really into the graphic novels.  If you're new to Tin Tin, I recommend of course starting with reading the graphic novels, but then definitely check out the cartoon...it followed the graphic novels pretty well.  The movies being made by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg based off these should be awesome as well!  My wife and I saw the 1st one and it was pretty good...looking forward to the following 2 movies set to be released down the road!  :-)",1325721600,,972,4.463276836158192
4689151,5,B005G5NPG0,"I watched this show in reruns on Nickelodeon years ago, before I ever read the comic books, and if I thought the cartoon would seem different after several years and after reading all of Tintin's adventures, I was wrong. It's as close to watching the characters in the books coming to life in full color as you'll ever see.

I enjoyed the new motion-capture Tintin movie as well, but on a different level, and as that's a different story borrowing liberally from several different Tintin adventures (all included in this set), you can freely watch all these episodes without spoiling the movie for yourself.

Can't wait for the ""Season Two"" set to drop in price, as it nears the release date!",1325635200,,692,4.710743801652892
4689152,5,B005G5NPG0,"When I was a child, there was a serial cartoon series  that ran on WPIX NY. Iwas a child of six, so it was a few years ago. I would sneak into my Aunt Barbara's room and watch this series. Later, the graphic novels  appeared  chapter forum in Children's Digest magazine. Later I owned the full set of books of this series. It was my Indiana Jones of my childhood

When I was in my thirties, In the 1980's, HBO was beginning to do series and family shows. TinTin came to HBO, they ran this cartoon series, which the first season is on this two disk dvd set. The amazing part of this 1980 cartoon series is that this  is a throw-back to the original graphic novel, which I grew up with. They barly have  changed a thing in its  transformation into this animated cartoon.

This is a great cartoon collection for the beginning fan of the TinTin books or an old die-hard fan of the series like myself. The animation is crisp and clean, like the classic Herge graphic novels were.

DONT WAIT FOR THE NEW FILM to introduce them to the magic of TinTin. if you have kids, start them out by having them  read these timeless graphic novels. You need to get  this animated set and watch it with your kids. It is a family adventure show that you can enjoy with or without a child. BUT it is better watching it with a young person.

The animated episodes that appear in this five hour collection are The Crab with The Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure (these three books is what the new movie is based upon). The Blue Lotus, Cigar of the Pharaoh, and The Calulus Affair

I cant wait until season two from Shout Entertainment.

And that is okay, because the gigantic machinery of animation in the United States, via Disney, Warner Brothers, Hanna-Barbera, and others have done a fantastic job in promoting their creations with a great dose of patriotism. For that reason, Tintin, as well as Asterix and Obelix, are only known by few people in our country, even though they are and have been huge in Europe and other parts for many years. But now, maybe due to the imminent release of Steven Spielberg's film ""The Adventures of Tintin,"" we are finally able to see the original animated TV series the way it is meant to be, with the release of the delightful DVD ""The Adventures of Tintin - Season One.""  And trust me, what a treat it is! If you haven't read the comic books yet, then you will love this series.

""The Adventures of Tintin"" was created by Georges Rmi (1907-1983), who the world would know as Herg, and it first appeared on January 10, 1929, with a total of 24 books published over many years. It is said that these books have been translated to 80 languages, and that more than 350 million copies have been sold.

 Tintin happens to be a very young Belgian journalist who can't say no to a good story, and always gets involved in some dangerous adventures. His dog, Snowy, usually accompanies him on his missions, which include a series of characters that have recurrent roles, such as Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and detectives Thomson and Thompson, two look-alikes who, even though are incredibly inept in their actions, actually help to solve crimes.

The TV series, which is the one presently reviewed and recommended, debuted in 1991, and 39 half-hour episodes aired for three seasons. It was produced by Ellipse, in France, and Nelvana, in Canada. The language of the series is English, but any visual signs and the like on the screen are in French.

The two-disc DVD edition of the series is comprised of seven episodes, six of them divided into two parts, including ""The Crab and the Golden Claws,"" ""The Secret of the Unicorn,"" ""Cigars of the Pharaoh,"" ""The Blue Lotus,"" ""The Black Island,"" and ""The Calculus Affair."" However, all these stories are presented as 13 episodes, in both English and Spanish.

Tintin reminds me of the animated TV series Johnny Quest, another favorite of yours truly. Both are about young men getting involved in adventures by accident, usually fighting evil characters. And, like Asterix, the quality of the art in Tintin is amazing - it is colorful and with lots of attention to detail. Tintin is also clean, fun entertainment for both adults and children. I was lucky to read a couple of the books some years ago - they are available in the USA --, and I recommend that you read the comics or watch the DVD before you see the Spielberg film. As I understand, the movie compressed three books of the Tintin series into one, and may be confusing for some. Needless to say, we all know that these books will be transformed for the tastes and consumption of the public in the United States, Hollywood-Style.  Thanks to Shout Factory for finally bringing Tintin to the US market. (France / Canada, 19911993, color, approximately 5 hrs).

Older kids who are okay with the above, are willing to suspend disbelief (Tintin has more lived than a cat!) and can stand his little dog Snowy's yapping throughout (he does contribute once I a while) will enjoy this series. No foul language, but bad guys are clearly bad - even I find my heart rate is up at times while watching. Great fun but definitely not a bedtime show. :)",1467676800,2,662,4.479338842975206

My 10 year old daughter and I were mid-way through series 1 when it vanished from another streaming service. We love Tintin's totally un-PC approach and swagger.

4689404,4,B005G5NPG0,"My review for all three Seasons of ""The Adventures of Tintin"". My entire family loved watching it. The animations are wonderful. The only thing I missed is that some of the wonderful moments from original comics book are missing. This is NOT always due to the current of level political correctness [for example, in ""Tintin in Tibet"", Tintin and Captain caught the flight to Kathmandu from New Delhi. Their last minute dash to the New Delhi Airport was fun and still stands politically correct in todays standard (as of 2013, to be politically correct from my side)]. This whole New Delhi episode is missing in this animated version. This is true for many stories in all the three seasons of ""The Adventures of Tintin"". I grew up reading Tintin and although I do not want to call somebody a ""blistering barnacle"", I still enjoy Captain do it.
Bottom-line- Worth watching, kids will love it; but if you grew up reading the original comics book, be prepared to miss some of the fine moments.",1367193600,4,989,4.722543352601156

Great music, characters' voices just about perfect, and the art is essentially Herg's set in motion (sure, it's not 3D, but it's distinctive and charming). My kids love these and--even though I read all the books dozens of times growing up--so do I. As a passionate Tintin fan, I endorse these without reservation.

4689418,5,B005G5NPG0,"My dad is a French professor. Growing up in the house, my siblings and I were exposed to many foreign things, both from my mom, who is Japanese, and my dad liked to share French culture with us. In particular he shared the French comic/cartoon stories of Asterix and Tintin. Growing up these two series of cmics and cartoons really inspired my imagination and brought me a lot of enjoyment. To focus on Tintin, in particular, the comics were available at the local library, and I used to always borrow them when they were available. In addition, my dad used to read these comics to me and my younger siblings frequently at night before we went to bed, these are some of the fondest memories from my childhood. Later on, we were able to get our hands on some of the video casettes of the cartoon series, based off the Tintin comic books. This review, is for the First Season of these cartoons, now on DVD.

For those not familiar with the Tintin stories, I will give as short summary of  the background and characters. Tintin, the protaganist and main character, is a reporter, whose investigative journalism ussually gets him wrapped up in all kinds of adventures and peril. Accompanying him on these journeys, is his pet and petite white dog, Snowy, who oftens ends up rescuing his master despite his small demeneor. Along the way, Tintin and Snowy, meet up with Captain Haddock, an alcoholic(recovering alcholic) merchant marine boat's captain, who ends up becoming an heir to an immense fortune, and ends up being Tintin's companion, and patron of sorts, on numerous adventures. There are two bumbling police detectives ,Thompson and Thomson, who are identical twins, and always end up crossing paths with our adventurers in one way or the other. Lastly, there is Professor Cuthbert Calculus, and eccentric scientific genius, who is very hard of hearing. Tintin and copmany find themselves on adventures, or solving mysteries all accross the world. Set in the 1920's to the 1960s, these stories include themes and issues present to the time, whether it be, imperialism, drug smuggling, espionage, and even space exploration.

This first season sets includes the stories ""The Cigars of the Pharoah"", ""The Blue Lotus"", ""The Black Island"",""The Calculus Affair"", ""Secret of the Unicorn"", and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"". All but ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" are two part espisodes. This first collection of episodes introduces you to all main characters, and all the stories are incredibly enjoyable.

I hope that in lieu, of the recent Spielberg ""Tintin"" film, interest in this series has exploded. My kid's were introduced to Tintin, through this film, and now they love the cartoons and the comics. This series is a really good series for the family, young and old can enjoy the stories and the characters. I am really happy to be able to enjoy this series with my kids, and I am glad that Tintin has done for them, what it did for me when I was younger.",1348358400,2,2949,4.856858846918489
4689419,5,B005G5NPG0,"My children and I have enjoyed watching all three seasons of TinTin and are absolutely hooked.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.  Great detective stories, fun humor, and refreshingly not America-centric.  I only wish there were more.",1344038400,5,239,5.2368421052631575
4689420,4,B005G5NPG0,A great addition to my movie collection. I used to watch this series when I was a kid and enjoyed it then and now. four stars because it would have been nice to have some extras about Herge on the DVD.,1343952000,,201,3.926829268292683
4689421,5,B005G5NPG0,"I was a fan of this show as a kid and it led me to discover the Tintin books.  I tried finding this anywhere for ten years before the big Speilberg/Jackson movie came out.  When it was announced, I knew these would finally be getting a DVD release after so many years.  The wait is worth it, as the episodes go in a nice order and the seasons are cheap to buy to boot!  We watched these with my stepchildren and now have them hooked on Tintin too!",1340409600,,447,4.045454545454546

4689423,4,B005G5NPG0,"Back in 1929, Belgian artist Georges Remi aka ""Herg&eacute;"", would create a comic book series titled ""Les Adventures de Tintin"" (The Adventures of Tintin) which was first published in the Belgian Newspaper Le XXe Siecle.

The comic book series would prove to be successful that it was made into several books, led to a Tintin magazine and also received aptations for film, radio, television and theater.

In fact, the comic book series was so popular that it appeared in many countries worldwide in more than 80 languages and over 350 million copies of the books were sold worldwide.

But for many people who were not familiar with the comic books or other adaptations, in America, many were introduced to ""The Adventures of Tintin"" through the animated series that aired on television back in 1991-1992.  A total of 39 half-hour episodes were created and are based on the best-known stories from the book.  And now the first season (the first 13 episodes) of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" will be released on DVD courtesy of Shout! Factory.

In order to appeal to a younger audience, there were some changes that needed to be made.  The key change was toning down the violence, the number of deaths and also the use of firearms.  Especially how the series would approach the use of alcohol, which Captain Haddock drinks a lot of.  Each time that Tintin is injured, he is able to bounce back to recover fairly quickly.  So, a few liberties were taken in order to appeal to children.  But certain elements such as the threats on Tintin's and Snowy's lives are still intact to a certain degree.

""The Adventures of Tintin"" features an adventurous Belgian reporter named Tintin who goes on adventures with his white fox terrier named Snowy.  The cases he takes on are typically dangerous and is often seen saving the day.  Joining Tintin is his best friend Captain Archibald Haddock, a respectable character who does things without thinking at times.

Other characters include the half-deaf Professor Calculus, who many international threats are after his inventions.  And there are the two bumbling detectives named Thomson and Thomson who are the comical relief of the series that are often after Tintin (as he is always in the middle of a crime scene in some way or form) or the criminals.

The following is a spoiler free synopsis of each story arc:

DISC 1:

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

It's important to note that ""The Adventures of Tintin"" was created in the early '90s and is an older series that was never fully detailed compared to popular American animation series.  But it fit the context of the comic book series quite wonderfully.

The series is presented in full frame and while the animation does show its age and looks a bit washed out, the animation still manages to hold up quite well 20-years later and is highly watchable.  As one would expect on DVD, you will see some ghosting but for the most part, the DVD looks good.

As for audio, the audio is presented in English and Spanish Dolby Stereo 2.0.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and didn't hear any major hissing or any audio problems while watching each episode.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features on ""The Adventures of Tintin"" DVD release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With the upcoming live-action film of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" from Steven Spielberg, the timing of the animated release is perfect as people not familiar with the series can get a taste of why this series has been popular among readers and those who grew up with the animated series.

Before the more grown up animation that we see today, during the 1990's, many series were created to boost the sales of popular toylines such as ""Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe"" to name a few.  And many animation on television were primarily targeted towards younger audiences.

While, superhero animated series such as ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"" and ""Batman"" were popular and introduced elements of mystery, what makes ""The Adventures of Tintin"" so accessible is that he's a normal guy.  Granted, he must work for a wealthy publication that can send him to exotic locations for his research but nevertheless, he's a regular guy who goes on investigations with his terrier Snowy and his friend Captain Haddock.

Also, what makes this series different from other animated series is that he is often the target of kidnappings and even assassination attempts.  Because he always covers these cases that are typically dangerous, he manages to get himself into quite a bit of trouble.  Or more like, trouble finds him quite often!

He's not a superhero with any major fighting skills, he's not a detective nor does he carry a weapon.  He's just a persistent journalist that happens to be successful in uncovering and solving cases.  And because the stories tend to feature him in a variety of locations all over the world, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is an animated series that manages to be exciting, adventurous, full of action and a lot of fun to watch!

If you are nostalgic for this series or wanting to watch the upcoming live-action film and want a bit more background on the classic adventures of Tintin, ""The Adventures of Tintin: Season One"" is definitely worth watching!

Although this is an animated series, because of the violence in ""The Adventures of Tintin"", it's not a series that you may want to buy for younger children.

Overall, if you are nostalgic of the series or have never heard of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and are interested in seeing the upcoming live-action film, the animated series is accessible and for the most part, a welcome addition to the animated library from Shout! Factory.

""The Adventures of Tintin: Season One"" is definitely recommended!",1335571200,,8066,4.716535433070866

4689429,4,B005G5NPG0,"While the episodes are the 1991 Ellipse production familiar to HBO viewers, and it is nice to have a region one DVD version, I have to wonder at the decision to place the episodes in the order that was chosen.  I'm not sure if this is the order that the series was actually shown in, or if the order of episodes on the DVDs was set for some other reason.

The 21 stories that make up the ""core set"" of the Tintin books were adapted for the television series.  Most are two episodes long, but two are single episode stories.  One of the single episode stories is included in this set. There are 7 stories on this DVD set, in 13 episodes.

The animation is acceptable, but is often a poor reflection of Herge's beautiful artwork from the books.  While some changes clearly had to be made to fit the television format, the television production includes some changes that are really inexplicable (removing some of the gags that appear in the books, and replacing them with other gags that seem to be generic cartoon humor, as an example).

On continuity/series order...

The set starts off with ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" (2 episodes)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tintin-Crab-with-Golden-Claws/dp/1405206209/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tintin - Crab with Golden Claws</a>, which is the story where Tintin meets Captain Haddock.

The first disc concludes with ""Cigars of the Pharaoh"" (2 episodes).

The second disc leads off with ""The Blue Lotus"" (2 episodes), followed by ""The Black Island"" (2 episodes), but skipping over ""The Broken Ear"" (which I assume will show up in the season 2 set).
The disc finishes off with ""The Calculus Affair"" (2 episodes), which comes much later in the series (it is the 16th or 18th story, depending on whether you are counting 21 or 24 stories as part of the series).",1329782400,2,4354,7.7364185110663986

4689431,4,B005G5NPG0,"I love the Tintin books and this animated DVD is true to the books; same animation and story lines. Unfortunately the voice acting is fairly stiff and unnatural especially the voice of Tintin. The one exception is the voice over of the dog Snowy which is great. I love the books, but one odd thing is the lack of female characters. The only major female character is the Opera singer Bianca Castafiore. Other than that, only very few females appear briefly in minor roles in the books. I think the books could have been way more fun with more girls and women. In fact the book ""The Castafiore Emerald"" with Signora Bianca Castafiore as the main character is my favorite Tintin book, because it's the funniest.",1329350400,,709,4.634920634920635
