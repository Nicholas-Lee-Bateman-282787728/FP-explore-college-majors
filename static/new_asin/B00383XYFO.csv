8390990,5,B00383XYFO,I really enjoyed this film! It's inspiring and carries a good message. There were a few mistakes in the film but considering it's more of an independent film it wasn't bad. I've been honoured to meet Christine Evans when she was doing concerts a few years ago and she's honestly one of the kindest people I've ever met. She's very talented as well. It was so interesting to see her in a movie as she's originally a music artist. The majority of the music used in the film is in fact hers. It's basically a movie about teenagers who have fallen on hard times (homeless) and help one another by providing each other with strength and believing in their dreams. Highly recommend it!,1301356800,,679,4.528455284552845
