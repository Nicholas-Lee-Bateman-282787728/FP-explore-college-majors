8348326,5,B001ZFTHO4,"the is one of the best constructed movies that I have seen. Acting and directing are excellent so is the photography. the story you can read about above. It is a truly sad story or a man's life and missed chances. If you are looking for blatant sexual scenes don't bother. It is a beautiful sad love story that is almost fantasy. the reason I say this is because of the main characters imagination, or is it imagination, Does the faerie actually exist.
 would I recommend this story? Yes, it is basically part of a unnamed set off 3 movies that should be in everyone's library.
 One must remember that Asian movies as most foreign movies are not as gross, bloody, or explicit as Americian movies.",1351641600,4,696,4.515873015873016
