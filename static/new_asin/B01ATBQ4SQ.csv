7608257,5,B01ATBQ4SQ,"My kids have loved Blaze since the show first came out and they continue to watch it if they catch it on. The show may seem like an action-packed car (truck) show but it does really have some good lessons in it. The lessons being teamwork, responsibility, confidence, and problem solving, just to name a few. This DVD even feature STEM topics including learning about Sound Waves. The example being that sound waves move through the air and travel to your ear to hear the noise, you hear Blaze's fire truck siren because sound waves bring the noise right to you. I read this to my kids (its on the box) before we watched and throughout the DVD I could see them thinking about sounds and how they work. I love when there is educational topics blended in with kid shows! You can also watch this DVD in Spanish and French!

I received this DVD complimentary in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1467676800,3,897,4.5030674846625764
