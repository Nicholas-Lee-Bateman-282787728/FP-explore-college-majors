3659535,5,B001JQHT4O,"I was able to catch this movie at 2 film festivals. The director, Russ Emanuel, was a terrific guy and you can tell he put his heart into this project. The story is extremely touching and really pulls at your heart strings. The lead actress did an awesome job-- she really held her own with John Heard. The ending has a great (for lack of a better word) twist that really makes you think.",1231545600,,388,4.256756756756757
3659536,4,B001JQHT4O,"This movie is recommended for those who like good indie films with plenty of character development and depth.  The writers did a good job melding different plot lines to keep the story moving.  For a first time director, he showed a steady hand at the helm.  This is definitely worth a watch, especially if you like substance over flash.",1231545600,,337,4.677966101694915
3659537,5,B001JQHT4O,"When I went to see P.J. in theater's I had questionable expectation's. When it was finished I was very surprised, I wasn't expecting what had just happened. It was a great movie!!! P.J. supply's the audience with solid characters and a wonderful heartfelt story that reflects the ideals of the true human spirit. I highly recommend this film to everyone!!!",1231459200,3,356,4.95
3659538,4,B001JQHT4O,"In these difficult times a thoughtful movie with an inspirational message is more than welcome. PJ delivers on both fronts. Howard Nash and John Heard's characters are both in search of solace and solutions and in the setting of a mental facility both struggle to find their individual paths. John Heard portrayal of Dr Shearson is a well crafted and believable performance. Howard Nash's PJ is a conflicted portrayal of man searching for meaning. Patrica Ray is masterful as ""PJ's"" girl friend. Vincent Pastore adds a comical spin and lightness to the darker portions of the movie. Neal Argo's music ties the elements of the film with a superb musical talent. Finally, Russ Emanuel's direction brings it all together with a fine touch for young director with great promise.",1231459200,2,774,5.007751937984496
3659539,4,B001JQHT4O,"With the line between what is low/no budget and ""Indy"" growing wider every day, PJ is a great representation of what true independent film making should be. Made on a shoestring budget by first time director Russ Emanuel, PJ succeeds where many features with ten times the budget fail. Delivering a skillfully shot, brilliantly scored and well acted piece of dramatic entertainment. The only real criticism should be in the screenplay which I felt was a bit too self motivated and had tendencies toward contrived, overly sentimental plot paths rather than establishing rich, dimensional characters that drive the story. This, unfortunately, led to some weak performances from the main character played by John Heard as well as a few of the ancillary, smaller characters. Patricia Rae, Howard Nash and Vincent Pastore, however, pick up the pieces and deliver some significant performances worthy of the accolades that the film has so far garnered.  If for nothing else, watch this film for the cinematography by Seth Melnick and the soundtrack by Neil Argo. Both are stellar for the size of the production.",1231113600,3,1105,5.138888888888889
3659540,5,B001JQHT4O,"If you're like me and tired of the endless stream of big budget ""Hollywood"" movies that recycle the same stories over and over than check this out. I saw P.J. at a theater in Los Angeles in 2008 and was really impressed.  This is a very good, character driven movie.  I'm a fan of Indy film makers and this movie delivered a strong dramatic story with out any CGI or Special Effects.  Just solid writing, directing, and great performances from a lot of familiar character actors.  I'm glad they've put out a DVD with extras.",1230595200,2,524,4.484210526315789

3659549,5,B001JQHT4O,This movie has a great moral behind it. I love films when there is heart put into making a film and P.J is definitely a movie that the director has put heart into it. The film is really touching and is totally worth watching.,1232236800,2,225,4.136363636363637
3659550,5,B001JQHT4O,"I have seen quite a few of Russ Emanuel's shorter films - and not only is he a dedicated and fantastic director, he really puts creativity at the forefront and produces some great cinematography supported by a strong and imaginative storyline. I am amazed to think that this was his first stab at a feature length film as the quality exceeds all expectations. He keeps us interested in the plot and characters from start to finish and allows you to delve right into the story. The characters are strong and the story is driven through them - and you immediately start sympathising and relating to them. This is a great piece of work and highly recommended if you are starting to get a bit tired of the same old same old mainstream films...!",1231804800,3,740,4.571428571428571
8313519,5,B001JQHT4O,"The acting is top-notch, the story too. But then again, any individual opposed to organized religion will absolutely love this movie. The 3 major religions all say someone (an ordinary person)will be ""chosen"" to intervene & save the lives of others, and will then pass this power on to someone else. That is the crux of this story. All the main characters are(alternatively)intrigued and threatened by the patient who knows their story. What to do? Commit him, or hear what he has to say? It's the challenge the Bible says we must all one day face. At the end of the day, it's discovered that PJ's there to help others and not snare them. I loved it!",1523923200,,650,4.564102564102564
