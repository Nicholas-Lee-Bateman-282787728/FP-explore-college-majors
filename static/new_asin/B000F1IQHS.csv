2548139,5,B000F1IQHS,"Entourage is one of my absolute favorite shows, so to have it on DVD is perfect!  I can watch it as often as I want.  If you're a fan of the show the 1st and 2nd seasons are a must.",1152403200,,181,3.5
2548140,5,B000F1IQHS,"If you add up the costs of either the oft-bogus Suggested price or the actual ""now"" sale price, the combined Season 1 and Season 2 package is cheaper than buying both separately.

As of the date of this writing, the package is about fifty cents cheaper.  Not a big savings by any take, but cheaper is cheaper.",1151625600,5,309,4.4035087719298245
2548141,1,B000F1IQHS,"NOTE: This review only pertains to the price of this box set, not the show. Entourage gets 5 stars.

However, this box set (combined seasons 1 and 2) is actually MORE expensive than purchasing each season separately. Box sets are supposed to save money, but that's not the case here. Save yourself $10 and buy each season separately.",1150070400,16,333,4.741379310344827
2548152,5,B000F1IQHS,Amazing fun in every way-plus in the show they hail from my home neighborhood in Queens (Bayside) and the manager used to work at a pizza place in the neighborhood in Queens I live now-Kew Gardens near Queens Blvd.-so that's the icing on the cake-plus great characterizations-these guys are just like me and my boys were growin up (except unfortunately we didn't then go do the Hollywood thing!),1173312000,,395,4.823529411764706
2548153,5,B000F1IQHS,If you are interested in the HBO show Entourage then this is highly recommended.  If you even just wanted to see what Entourage was about I would recommend this.  It's a great show and the price for these two seasons is outstanding.  It is an overall EXCELLENT value!!,1168473600,,268,4.541666666666667
2548154,5,B000F1IQHS,The DVDs were a holiday gift.  The party who received them was pleased.,1168300800,,71,4.461538461538462
2548155,5,B000F1IQHS,"This is by far one of the best shows out there.  Once you start watching, you can't stop until you have seen every episode, and even after that, you still want more.",1167868800,2,165,4.15625
2548156,5,B000F1IQHS,"Entourage has a little bit of everything for everyone.  The writing is simply amazing - one of the best in TV.  There's plenty of attractive people (if that's your thing) and tons of guest stars (if that's your thing).  Simply put, this is one of the best shows on TV.",1167868800,,268,4.32
2548157,5,B000F1IQHS,"This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. If you buy both seasons seperately, you would save some money because Amazon has priced the package higher than if bought seperately.",1166400000,,185,4.470588235294118
2548158,5,B000F1IQHS,"This show is one of the best in awhile. Then again, HBO is superior. Jeremy Piven, who plays Ari Gold in the series, will keep you laughing. Definitely a must see. If you like Curb Your Enthusiasm you will like Entourage. (even though Curb is my favorite of the two I still love Entourage!)",1162857600,,290,4.388888888888889
2548159,5,B000F1IQHS,"This show is a lot of fun.  The dialog is quick and hilarious, the cast is perfect (casting Kevin Dillon as the less famous brother of a big movie star is brilliant), the cameos are great.  Adrian Grenier is beautiful to look at and Jeremy Piven is outrageously funny.  The humor is very ""male,"" but you definitely get a glimpse of what young Hollywood is probably really like.  I liked season one better than season two only because I didn't buy the Vince-Mandy Moore romance plot-line, but other than that, both seasons were a blast!",1162771200,,535,4.6
2548160,4,B000F1IQHS,"The Entourage series is definietly one of the best TV shows i have seen.  It is extremely funny to anyone that has any type of sense of humor.  The series is about a young adult movie star that shares a house with three friends and his older brother.  This show is awesome because i can relate to them being a young adult, because they go out and party, drink alcohol, smoke pot, and at the end of the night they are just trying to get laid.  Also, since he is a movie star, he has a ton of money, so you can see what it would be like to be a rich young adult having fun.  Entourage also has a lot of popular guest appearances, such as Jessica Alba, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Green, and many more, which makes the series seem more real.

I didn't give it 5 stars just because their is only about eight 30 minute episodes in season one.  If their were more episodes in this two season package i would have given it 5 stars.  The second season has about eighteen 30 minute episodes.  Overall a great show that everyone should see.",1162684800,2,1021,4.168367346938775
2548161,4,B000F1IQHS,"This show is like Sex and the City - the male version. You will relate to the things these guys go through, not to mention laugh every time Jeremy Piven is onscreen. The story begins after Vincent Chase has had his big break and follows him and his friends through Hollywood. Piven is his conniving agent and has a great time arguing with one of Vinny's friends, Eric (who is also Vinny's manager). You'll love their back and forth. There are also several cameos by celebrities playing themselves (James Cameron, Jamie Pressly, Mandy Moore, Hugh Hefner, Pauly Shore ... just to name a few). One important thing, there is not a lot of time spent showing what Vinny actually does on the set of his movies. Most of the coverage is about his after-work life and between-movie life. The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is that the shows sometimes tend to end in strange places, either covering too much or not enough. The show is produced by Mark Wahlberg and is aimed for 20-30something guys (and the girls who have never understood why they do what they do).",1162684800,,1071,4.55440414507772
2548172,5,B000F1IQHS,"This is a really fun series to watch, the bonus material was interesting too.",1162684800,,77,4.571428571428571
2548173,5,B000F1IQHS,"I think Entourage has the best DVD quality with excellent music and sound quality ,more than that it comes with a hard cover case which protects the dvd I have been having a great time watching the season 1 and lookign forward for season 2",1162512000,,239,4.333333333333333
2548174,4,B000F1IQHS,"Let me start off by saying that Entourage is currently my favorite show to watch.  You don't have to live in Hollywood or be in the business to appreciate the rapid-fire banter and acid-tongued humour of mostly soulless, bottom-line crazy, image obsessed actors and the agents, publicists, managers and hangers-on who indulge them.

As a huge fan of Sex and the City, I immediately got hooked on this show not just for its intelligent blend/balance of humour and pathos (none of whom do it better than Jeremy Piven and the extremely underrated Kevin Dillon) but much like Sex and the City, it is a show about a fantasy world for 4 people who go through so much, get screwed by so many but will always have each other.  The family bond between Vince, E, Drama and Turtle (I love that we don't know his real name) is what drives the show and keeps it grounded no matter how crazy things get.  No one anticipated the show's return for Season 3 more than I and it didn't disappoint.

The DVD, especially for Season 2, however, did.  The great thing about Entourage is that it is such a ""behind-the-scenes"" show.  Not only giving you a behind the scenes look at Hollywood and the business that is Hollywood but also because the writers are so great at creating backstories to just about every character without actually telling you what they are.  I was so hoping that the DVD for Season 2 would reveal how they managed to get this actor to guest star or what funny/crazy/scary story happened when they shot on such and such location but instead we got nothing.  No audio commentaries, no deleted scenes or alternate endings.  No footage of Johnny Drama's previous guest spots (I mean, come on, who isn't dying to see him playing the bulimic pedophile on the Commish).  There are so many episodes of Season 2 that I would have loved to have known more about but all we get are the Mark Wahlberg sessions, which a) I had already seen on HBO On Demand and b) weren't that interesting because we don't really learn more about the show and c) Mark Wahlberg comes off as a bit of a douchebag.

I would have loved audio commentary on Chinatown, if not for the last 2 minutes alone and because I love Asian cinema.  How could they not have Chris Henchy, one of the writers of the show, comment on Blueballs Lagoon which guest starred his real life wife, Brooke Shields?!  James Cameron, one of the biggest directors in Hollywood, does a recurring guest spot and no one has anything to say about it?  Mandy Moore plays a huge role and we are left wondering why they decided to give Vince a real relationship, why Mandy Moore (I felt it was a bit of an odd choice) and why did she refuse to come back in the 3rd season and they basically act like she never existed.  You would think a writing staff of men would have something to say about shooting at the Playboy Mansion (Aquamansion, great episode, with great scenes by Ralph Macchio and Pauly Shore) or at Sundance or at a real Lakers game.

I was really let down with the lack of extras in the DVD, especially with the lack of audio commentary.  Hopefully, they will beef it up for Season 3.

Not to deter anyone from watching the show, this is one of the best written shows on television.  If you loved Sex and the City and you are not watching this show then you are truly missing out.  Networks have tried to emulate the magic that was SATC (cough, Heather Graham, cough) but none have come close.  That is because SATC already has an heir to the throne and Entourage is it.  People are just fooled because the show is about 4 men instead of 4 women and is in LA, not New York.  And if you have not discovered the wonder that is Kevin Dillon...I mean, I never even knew that Matt Dillon had a brother until this show!  Kevin Dillon's Johnny Drama is probably one of the funniest, smartest and most complex characters written on television to date.  He is absurd, self-centered, pathetic, self-conscious, puerile, weathered, smart, stupid and still a very real human being.  Dillon manages to take the most ridiculous character and fill him with so many nuances that Drama can go from one extreme to the next in a matter of seconds (and he often does) and you still totally buy it.  I could watch Dillon act for hours, he's that good and while I love Jeremey Piven, I have to say if anyone should be nominated for and win an Emmy, it should be Dillon.

I'm giving the DVD boxset 4 out of 5 stars.  The show itself gets 5 out of 5 but the DVD gets 3 out of 5 because of lack of extras.",1161388800,,4526,4.411552346570397
2548175,4,B000F1IQHS,"This is such an awesome show!  Jeremy Piven is a comdeic god, all the actors are great!  It gets a little depressing at times, only because their lives look so exciting.  I could watch this show again and again, and now I have my husband hooked too.",1157500800,,249,4.25531914893617
2548176,5,B000F1IQHS,"If you're so inclined, 'Entourage' can be easy to resist.

A posse of callow youth from Queens moves to Los Angeles, the better to sponge off the Friend Who Made It --- that is, if being a disposable pretty boy in B-list movies is your idea of making it. But Vincent Chase is never seen at work. He seems to be on an endless vacation, going to parties and scoring chicks and smoking dope. Meanwhile, his pals are working him. Eric (""E"") capitalizes on their grade school friendship to become Vince's manager. Johnnie, known as ""Drama"", tries to revive his acting career, but as Vince's older half-brother, is most useful as a breakfast cook. Rounding out the entourage is Turtle, who functions as a driver and house manager when not toking up. The most interesting character is Vince's agent, Ari Gold, who either suffers from Tourette's or is just a nasty piece of work (or both).

My wife started watching 'Entourage' and, soon enough, she had a grand theory of a new style in television: shows like 'House' and 'Entourage' lure you in precisely because they're built around characters who are mean and anti-social. Truth is a weapon for them. They never use a velvet globe when an iron fist is handy. We like these characters, she told me, because they give themselves permission to say anything. Authority? They don't fear it. Confrontation? Bring it.

Yummy theory --- who doesn't like a little obnoxiousness now and then? So I watched a recent episode of 'Entourage'. Then I went back and watched every episode from the just-ended season and the DVDs of seasons one and two. And I am here today, chastened, to say that 'Entourage' is the funniest, deadliest, most satisfying television I have watched in donkey's years.

Is it shallow? No. It plumbs the depths of shallow, which, in a shallow culture like ours, is as deep as you need to go. That is, I don't see Vincent as a weak pretty boy; I see him as naturally wise. He's catnip to women, but he doesn't lie to them. He's detached --- he cares about his career, but he's generally indifferent to the outcome. He's both in the world and not of it; he understands better than anyone that Hollywood is a game. His strategy is simply to enjoy it while it lasts.

Like my wife, I have a theory of the show: Vince is the Buddha, and his entourage is his sangha. He provides little teaching exercises that help them grow. He provides the same service for Ari Gold, who is forced, by Vince's example, to go against his nature and tell the truth --- to be a friend, not just a talent salesmen.

I'm taking the show seriously, as I think you will, if you surrender to it and, as we have done, watch three or four half-hour episodes a night. But the best way to sell you on it is probably to lean on the humor --- which is considerable. For this is the fastest-paced show possible; the whip-smart dialogue cuts like a lash. (It's HBO: R-rated TV --- that is, in a calm moment.)

Ari Gold is the king of this banter. He's the ultimate insider, possessor of all knowledge, and how best to use it to his advantage. To him, Eric is ""Pizza Boy,"" because his last job was managing a Sbarro's in New York. Meetings end with Ari saying, ""Let's hug it out, bitch.""

Ari's relationship with Vince and Eric is nothing less than a comic tutorial on the inner workings on Hollywood. Although he's only got an independent film to show for himself, Vince wants to be a serious actor --- he's not eager to be the hero of ""Aquaman,"" a surefire summer blockbuster.

Vince buys Marlon Brando's old house. But he still has no job. Now he needs ""Aquaman."" Which now has a director: James Cameron. Who might not be willing to go to Sundance to see Vince's low-budget movie.

These plot points, you see, are minute. But very important in the game. 'Entourage' moves as fast as tennis; the serves come in at 140 miles an hour. And, delightfully, they get smashed back. At the end of the just completed season, Vince fires Ari Gold. In real life, that episode ran on the very night of the Emmys --- when Piven won the Best Supporting Actor award. Think he won't be back in season four?

I'll be watching. And if you let these DVDs into your house, so, I bet, will you.",1157500800,,4193,4.489501312335958
2548177,4,B000F1IQHS,"The show entourage follows 4 best friends from Queens, NY who moves to Hollywood to pursue Vincent Chase's dream of becoming a star. The show begins right when Vince's carrer kicks off in the right direction, giving them the life that they all dreamed of...consisting of girls, money, and glamour.

This show consists of the perfect casting including Jeremy Piven who plays Ari Gold (Vince's agent) and is ""one of the most powerful men in Hollywood"". A workaholic with a quick temper, constant sarcasm, and frenetic physical presence. Also with Kevin Dillion (Matt Dillon's younger brother) who plays Drama, Vince's older brother, who is an unemployed actor. Kevin Connolly plays E, who is Vince's manager and best friend. And Jay Ferrara who plays Turtle.

The DVD's include the first and second season, and the episodes are absolutely great.  However there is not much special features that comes with it. Even so I would definately reccomend buying these seasons if you are a fan of Entourage.

This show has also won numerous amounts of Emmy's and Golden Globes awarding the casting, directing, and acting.",1157414400,,1110,5.049180327868853
2548178,4,B000F1IQHS,"Though they're both enjoyable, I found myself enjoying the second season of ENTOURAGE much more than the first. I don't know if this is because it's a full season (as opposed to the shortened first one), or because I've gotten past the characters' (especially Turtle's and Drama's) loutishness, and now I can see the humor for the trees.

Or maybe the writing improved just a smidgen, and that's all it took for this show to deliver on its potential? Anyway, the storylines now click, the banter and comedy flow naturally (none of the ""trying too hard"" syndrome I noticed first time out), and the actors are delivering the goods. Much has been made of Jeremy Piven nailing his role of Ari, but the supporting cast (especially the guy who plays Lloyd, Ari's secretary) are really hitting their marks too.",1156723200,4,803,4.776978417266187
2548179,5,B000F1IQHS,"We got this set because a friend of mine was raving about how great Season 3 is. This show is absolutely hilarious and especially funny if you live (or have lived in Southern California). The antics of the boys are always entertaining and Jeremy Piven shows that he is the real deal and carries the show. Kevin Connolly and Kevin Dillon are great too, in their respective roles. If you have HBO, Season 3 is available on On-Demand right now, so you too can get caught up before the episodes run out. Rumor has it Season 4 will not start until Summer 2007. HIGHLY recommended.",1155686400,,575,4.485714285714286
