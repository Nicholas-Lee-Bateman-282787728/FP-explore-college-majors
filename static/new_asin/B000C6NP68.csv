8096045,3,B000C6NP68,Three stars not because of seller but lack of plot. While this anime had the potential to be great it lacked romance with sora and fujimori and waited till the last minute to even show a shred of romance for the couple. There was more romance with the others than the main which was sad. The series was also way too short which I feel crippled this series. If you are a yaoi fan I fear you will be disappointed.,1484611200,,411,4.15
8096046,5,B000C6NP68,"This series was defintely one of my favorite shonen-ai. The plot was muddled, but after watching the entire series through once, then going back through it again, everything makes sense. All the pains Sora goes through just to figure out his lost memories and the shocking truth about Nao! Its well worth the wait.

The ending was painfully sad but touching. And FINALLY, you get to see what the heck happened between Sora and Nao to make the pink-haired boy agitated towards the prior.

All in all, a definite MUSTY! ^__^",1144281600,3,522,4.725274725274725
