1881449,5,B0000996IS,"This is an amazing show. A great mix of physical comedy, punchlines, timing, and characters is what a sitcoms about. This season has some outstanding episodes that fans of the show consider the best ever
TOW the jellyfish, TOW Chandler in a Box, TOW the embryos, TOW all the haste, and TOW ross's wedding. None of the other episodes could be called fillers considering how great, different, and witty they all are. (peronal favorites include TOW all the rugby, TOW they are going to party, TOW the wedding dresses, and TOW the free porn) all are simply hillarios. if you don't believe me, check it out yourself...i know you'll be satisfied.

1881455,5,B0000996IS,"In my opinion the fourth season of friends has to be the funniest of all of them for these reasons- ross & rachel getting back together(for a minute), the one where pheobe thinks the spirit of her mother is in a cat, also she has her brothers babies for him, ross meets emily and decides to propose, rachel in turn gets jealous, chandler and joey throw ross an engagement party that goes sour when the engagment ring becomes missing and ross says the wrong thing at his wedding!!! Plus the cast goes to london. Now this is only a taste of what season four is all about, you'll have to buy it to see the rest and it's totally worth the money . well enjoy",1051488000,12,653,4.232

1881486,5,B0000996IS,"While there are many classic episodes and storylines in the 90's sitcom Friends, I think it would be easy to argue that season 4 has the most memorable of the show's run.  (And my favorite episode doesn't even come until season 5.)  There's less drama and plenty of fun laughs as this sextet of friends face life together.

The season starts out exactly where last season ended as Ross (David Schwimmer) must make a choice between Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and his current girlfriend.  As the season progresses, Chandler (Matthew Perry) fights his growing affection for roommate and best friend Joey's (Matt LeBlanc) current girlfriend.  The two of them swap apartments with Rachel and Monica (Courteney Cox).  And Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) agrees to become the surrogate mother for her brother and sister-in-law who can't have kids on their own.  Meanwhile, Ross falls head over heals in love with a woman fromLondonand proposes to her after only a few weeks.

Yeah, all that is really in this season.  And while we get more drama between Ross and Rachel, it's funnier here and not quite as dark as some episodes were last season.  In fact, the entire season is filled with many funny moments and lines.  It doesn't matter how many times I've seen them, I still crack up.  Plus these stories are among the most classic the show ever produced with arguably the best known cliffhanger of the series.

By season four of a show, the writers and actors know the characters, and it shows.  The main cast is amazing hitting the jokes perfectly every week while keeping things believable.  And when they are called on for more serious moments, they nail those as well.  This is especially true of Lisa Kudrow, who won an Emmy for her work here.  In the guest star department, the likes of Penn Millette, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Michael Vartan, Charlton Heston, and Hugh Laurie stop by.

The season consisted of 24 half hour shows, including the two part finale that takes most of the cast to London.  All of them are here on 4 discs and presented in full frame and surround sound.  Okay, since the show is shot in a studio, the surround isn't that impressive, but over all the picture and sound are nice.  Extras include three interesting commentaries by the creators/executive producers, and couple of clips features from the season, an interesting documentary on how the show is aired in foreign countries, and a trivia challenge based on the one Ross creates during the season.  Unfortunately, it just has 10 questions, so it's not worth playing more than once.

Friends has already managed to become comfort viewing for me.  Just a few minutes with these characters is enough to lift my spirits and have me laughing.  Season 4 has so many great stories it's hard to name a season that was better over all.",1432598400,,2796,4.775

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I was hoping that the episodes would include the full length time as the DVDs do (FYI: the show on TV doesn't actually play the entire episode. They cut out a few minutes worth of dialogue and plot to shrink it for TV. The full length episodes are on the DVDs.). I find myself really missing those extra couple of minutes, but I'm a hardcore fan. If that doesn't bother you, go for it! You can't ever go wrong with Friends.",1420502400,,570,4.098214285714286

Friends manages to avoid going into too many popular culture references, things that would quickly lose their edge over time, and sticks with more universal humor that stays funny today.

My wife introduced me to Friends, as I was one of those men who just never really watched it growing up. One Christmas I surprised her and bought all 10 Seasons and included a special ""coupon"" that I would watch every episode with her before next Christmas. I made good on my promise, and after watching all 10 seasons, I become a fan. Sure there are things to criticize, and I there are other series (like Arrested Development) that I personally like more, but Friends will always be a staple.

1881544,5,B0000996IS,"That subject line is the nutshell of this fourth season of Friends.  But is a nutshell ever really enough to discribe the antics of Rachael, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross?  I would have to say ""NO!""  Leading off the list of great guest stars who join our six friends is a cat apparently possessing the spirit of Phoebe's dead mother.  Then there's Chip Matthews, the jock of Monica and Rachael's high school days, who has either never left those days behind him or he's seen ""Fast Times At Richmont High"" a few too many times.  Speaking of the past, an old friend of Ross and Chandler's from their college days, known only as ""Gandalf"", had planned to stop by but had to cancel at the last minute...this makes me wonder, based on the stories the guys share about him, what would have happened if he had shown up (still wondering, by the way.)  Joey proves himself an impressive ballroom dancer, passing these skills on to the building's super who's looking to impress a woman.  And we get a romantic situation that could perhaps be spicier than Ross and Rachael when Chandler falls for Joey's girlfriend, who becomes more than a one-night-stand for the latter.  But let's not forget the relationship that everyone remembers.  Ross meets a woman, Emily, and a whirlwind romance cullminates with a wedding that will leave everyone speechless.  How did we ever survive the summer after this season finale?  While I ponder that, go out and get the fourth season of Friends and find out what I'm not telling.

1881641,5,B0000996IS,"Though Friends is admittedly getting a bit dated, in watching through the seasons once again, I am reminded of just why I loved this show so much.  The brilliant writing, the chemistry and comedic talents of the actors, and the outrageous and irresistible characters add up to such an enjoyable viewing experience.

Season four is notable for the continuation of the Ross and Rachel saga, which ultimately culminates in Ross's marrying Emily but saying Rachel's names during his vows.  The season serves to show how out of sync Rachel and Ross are and how really deluded they can be when they each try to convince themselves that they no longer feel anything for the other.

The gem of this season, though, is Phoebe becoming a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife.  This means that we get to see more of Giovanni Ribisi as her hilarious brother and it is the season that had quite possibly one of the funniest lines in television, in which Frank Jr. exults in the news that his sister is pregnant with his baby.  It also provides fodder for some very funny pregnancy gags, such as watching Rachel and Monica's well-intentioned shower for Phoebe go horribly awry.

This season also grants us some conflict between Joey and Chandler and especially helps to develop Chandler's character a bit further.  When Chandler crosses the line with Joey's girlfriend Kathy, we see just how angry Joey can be--and also how generous and concerned for his friend's happiness.  It's never been a secret that Chandler is afraid of commitment but his relationship with Kathy shows just how neurotic Chandler can be.

Perhaps best of all, this season really ends with a bang when Monica and Chandler finally get together.  There had been hints throughout the series up to that point but the revelation that the two of them slept together is still a big surprise.",1211587200,10,1852,4.8107255520504735

The fourth season is one of the weaker seasons, in my opinion, but a weak season of Friends still beats most other shows on tv.  Highlights of season 4 include the boys-vs-girls game (who knows each other best) and the trip to London during the season finale (one of the best finales from any of the seasons).",1168300800,,543,4.625

1881662,4,B0000996IS,"""Friends"" keeps going strong.  I never watched it while it was in production, but I have discovered it on DVD and am enjoying it immensely.  By this point, the writers and actors are taking full  advantage of the large ensemble cast, which offers numerous story opportunities.  Interesting character dynamics have emerged by this point in the series, such as the way in which cast members mirror each other in male-female pairings.  Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) are the romantic ones, Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica (Courtney Cox) are the neurotic ones, and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) are the ditzy ones who live their lives in their own idiosyncratic ways.  By the end of this season, two of these pairings have literally paired up.  Will the third do the same?  I don't think so...but DON'T TELL ME!",1160092800,,848,4.964539007092198
1881663,3,B0000996IS,"To be sure, there is a lot to like about the 4th Season of Friends.  Unfortunately, contrary to most of the Amazon reviews posted here, I feel it's also one of the silliest (and not in a god way) seasons.  There are a number of multi-episode storylines that were so forgettable that watching some of these episodes on DVD was like seeing them for the first time.  To wit: the love triangle between Joey, Chandler, and Kathy; and Rachel's new boyfriend Joshua.  Of course, Pheobe acting as host mother for her brother's babies is unforgettable, but ultimately annoying and silly as well.

Having said that, there are some outstanding individual moments and episodes.  My second-favourite episode in the whole series is probably ""The One With the Embryos,"" in which Ross builds a quiz game to determine if the girls know the boys better, or vice versa.  As a result, Joey and Chandler (and the birds!) get to take over Monica's apartment.  Another ongoing storyline that I liked was the Ross-Emily courtship.  Of course, it is ultimately doomed to failure (as all of Ross's marriages are), but the Rachel's jealousy sometimes takes the jokes to some fun places.  And, of course, no review could truly be complete without some reference to Ross's ""Sound"" that he debuts for the public - basically a random collection of synthesiser sounds accompanied by free-verse poetry.

Season 4 does set up the form that the rest of the series will take, and in that sense it is a pivotal season.  Chandler and Monica's pairing starts here, as does the running joke of Ross and his divorces, Phoebe's mellowing into a sympathetic character, and the basic Rachel-Ross dynamic for the rest of the series.  Many fans were very upset by Season 5, when Rachel apparently has a complete change of heart in her feelings for Ross, but for this season, her performances are consistent and believable (that she is in denial about her continuing feelings for Ross).  Of course, all the actors are very good this season, as they have settled into their characters and know them intimately.

It's just too bad that the ongoing stories are mostly forgettable.  Otherwise, Season 4 really would have been the best season.",1157328000,,2191,4.849462365591398
1881664,5,B0000996IS,"The fourth season of the show represents Friends at the top of its game. The writers are at their hysterical best here and the cast continues to explore their characters with increasing depth, humor, and heart. The majority of the characters face some huge character arcs in this season and all the actors step up their game, even Cox, who isn't given too much to do this year. Monica's biggest story this season is changing jobs and eventually finding some success at a fancy resturant, but not before having to win over some hostile staff members. Cox is hsyerical as Monica, who always has to be liked, tries to win over her angry waiters. Schwimmer's  Ross is at his earnest, neuortic best this season, as he bickers with Rachel the majority of the year, before eventually finding ""love"" with Emily. As much as I like Ross and Rachel together, I also love them apart, since Schwimmer and Aniston are so funny to watch when they are fighting and trying to make each other jealous, which they do a lot of during the season. Chandler faces some unwanted romantic feelings for one of Joey's girlfriend, and Perry takes the opporunity to show a different side to Chandler. The first three seasons, Chandler was mainly a go to the joke type character full of one-liners and quirks. However, his budding relationship with his roommate's girl allows him to show Chandler's softer side and because of Perry's honest portrayal Chandler becomes a much more relatable character. LeBlanc's Joey finds himself facing betrayal by his best friend, and the actor manages Joey's hurt and conflict well. It will still be a few seasons before LeBlanc hits his mark as Joey, but he continues to grow as an actor here and shows that Joey is not just a dense womanizer and that he lives by a strict code of morals. While all the actors are incredible this season, it is Aniston and Kudrow who steal the show. Aniston's Rachel continues her growth as a complex character, and at the same shows some of the self-centered, b***** Rachel that was around during the first season. Aniston is so good at playing a character who can be so self-involved, while still making her vulnerable and likeable. Aniston is both funny and vulnerable as Rachel tries to win Joshua's attention and also deals with the realization that Ross is moving on. This season should've at least garnered her an emmy nod, if just for her performance in ""TOW the Wedding Dresses."" Kudrow, who won an Emmy for this season, is also on fire here and is given the biggest character arc, as Phoebe agrees to be a surrogate for her brother's babies. Kudrow plays Phoebe with a hysterical off-centredness and has a real warmth and heart that comse through in her portrayal. Only Phoebe would agree to carry her brother's children knowing how hard it is going to be once the pregnancy ends, and Kudrow is a real comic pro here. She manages to let Phoebe show some real heart, without losing the comedic aspect of the story or her character. Standout episodes from this season include ""TOW Chandler Crosses the Line,"" ""TOW Chandler in a box,"" ""TOW the Girl From Poughkeepsie,"" ""TOW Phoebe's Uterus,"" ""TOW Rachel's Crush,"" ""TOW All the Rugby,"" ""TOW the Fake Party,"" ""TOW the Free Porn,"" ""TOW All the Haste,"" ""TOW the Wedding Dresses,"" ""TOW the Worst Best Man Ever,"" ""TOW Ross's Wedding,"" and of course ""TOW the Embryos,"" which features the now infamous girls v. guys trivia game that results in the loss of Monica and Rachel's apartment. Definitely one of the best, if not THE best, season of one of the greatest sitcoms.",1148515200,,3559,4.731078904991948
1881665,5,B0000996IS,"Season Four of Friends is definitley my favouite out of all of them UP TO SEASON 4. This season contains many classics. The characters are really developing now and Friends is now establised as a world wide hit by the time Season 4 Ended. The Season Finale was a shocker (I take thee Rachel! :O) and the Seaosn opener was just as good!

Well there really isn't much I can say about Season 4, apart from that it is really good after Season One, Season Four is the next Vital one to buy!

My Personal Top 5 Episodes Are:

The One With The Jellyfish

The One With Chandler In A Box

The One With The Embryos

The One With All The Wedding Dresses

The One With Ross's Wedding

(The One with Joey's new Girlfriend is also a highlight for me as it contains Phoebe's ''sick'' songs, she has a cold and performs some of her ''best'' singing ever. Her ""Sticky Shoes"" and ""Paper Mache Man""songs were the some of the main highlights of all of her songs and of the Series. LOL Very Funny!)

Overall Season 4 Is a must buy. Best one to date (1994-1998)",1145923200,,1039,4.260204081632653

I also like ""...The Worst Best Man Ever"". And as you know, Monica and Chandler get together at the end of this season. Like all sitcoms, the series would eventually go downhill but it was still going strong around this time.",1136937600,,373,4.420289855072464
1881668,5,B0000996IS,"This is a very funny season of friends. Good stories, fun characters, this is worth watching. I won't go through all the episodes because other people have done that, but it short, it's worth your time.",1131408000,2,202,4.638888888888889
1881669,5,B0000996IS,"I watched about 12 or 15 shows of Friends during its 10-year run, but I thought it got better as the years went on, especially this 4th season. They got off the silliness of the 1st and 2nd seasons and matured as most people in their mid to late 20s do between the 4th and 10th.  The producers and writers wanted to keep them single all the time and date people, but real life doesn't go like that.  That's why several of them got married and had babies later on.  But I watched that funny season finale, which is still my favorite out of their 236 shows.  Watched it on NBC in May 1998 when Ross was getting married to longtime girlfriend Emily. Ross says the WRONG girl's name at the altar!!!!!  When he said ""Rachel"", I rolled off laughting!!!! Rachel was whom Ross went with before. They still show that show in past clips!  I noticed Emily's shocking look on her face.  Easily the series' funniest moment and shows why Central Park's six characters are known for their aloofness.  I have more respect for this show because of this hilarious wedding episode.  It wasn't the typical tired wedding show that network sitcoms or dramas love to make to pull in 20 to 25 million viewers for the season finale. Wedding themed shows pull in big ratings every time. It showed a common thing in weddings, the nervousness of bride and groom forgetting their own companion's names. And this show succeeded on all levels. The other shows of the 4th season were good, but they're no contest to this finale.",1130716800,3,1496,4.511111111111111
1881670,5,B0000996IS,"I thought the third season was great, but after watching the fourth season, I gotta say I have a new favorite.  The storylines are absolutely brilliant.  I feel that one of the best storylines of the series is Phoebe becoming a surrogate for her half-brother and wife.  When the writers were faced with the daunting task of deciding what to do with Lisa Kudrow's real-life pregnancy, they could have decided to ignore it (like Julia Louis-Dreyfus of Seinfeld) or come up with some lame storyline.  However, they delivered something that not only is true to her character, but it's totally believable.  Kudos to the writers for coming up with such a great storyline!

Also, I gotta say that Jennifer Aniston shines in this season.  Rachel experiences many different emotions throughout the season, and Jennifer did an excellent job conveying these emotions.

Of course, I end my reviews with a rundown of my favorite episodes during the season, and here they are:

The One With the Jellyfish

1881671,5,B0000996IS,"The 4th season of Friends is one of my favorite seasons. It includes Ross's second wedding, Chandler and Monica hooking up, Pheobe's decision to be a surrogate for her brother Frank and his wife, and, of course, Chandler in a box. Some of the best episodes (in my opinion) are-

The One With the Ballroom Dancing- Joey tries to protect Rachel from Mr Treeger (the building superintendant), but ends up getting the girls an eviction notice, and the only way to help them is to give the man dancing lessons.

The One Where They're Going to Party- Ross and Chandler are excited when they're old college friend Mike 'Gandalf' Ganderson, is coming to visit, but then must face facts that they're getting older. Monica insults a restaurant owner- but then gets a job because of it.

The One With the Embryos- After learning of the odds of her getting pregnant, Pheobe is worried she's going to let her brother down. Monica & Rachel hodl a contest against Joey & Chandler to see who knows 'whom' better.

The One With All the Rugby- In order to impress Emily, Ross decides to play rugby. Monica obsesses over a switch in Joey & Chandler's apartment, doing whatever she can to find out what it does. Chandler pretends to move to Yemen (where is Yemen, I've got no idea) so he can escape Janice.

The One With the Worst Best Man Ever- Ross has to decide who he wants as his best man for his wedding, but when Joey's duck eats his grandmother's wedding ring, the bird may have to be sacrificed to get it. Pheobe experiances mood swings as her due date nears.

Season Four is one of my favorite seasons, and all Friends fans should enjoy it.",1122076800,,1630,4.508474576271187
1881672,5,B0000996IS,"This season is regarded by many as the Friends strongest ever, and this is also my choice for the show's best season ever. It's just I love the whole feel of this season, very settling and ""homy"" but also fresh in terms of the storylines they did. This is the season where Phoebe became the surrogate mother of her brother's baby, Chandler and Joey fight over a girl, Ross wedding to Emily and of course the genesis of Monica and Chandler's romance. It's just pure perfection.

 Standouts episodes are TOW the Embryos (one of the very best episodes of the series), TOW the Fake Party (Aniston's comic highlight of the season), TOW Chandler in a Box (memorable for Le blanc and Perry), TOW Joey's New Girlfriend (Lisa Kudrow's storyline was hilarious, she stole the episode), Tow the Jellyfish, TOW the Cuffs, and the London finale TOW Ross' Wedding (London baby!!!)

My favorite Friends storyline of all time is Phoebe getting pregnant. I know that it was done to accommodate Lisa Kudrow's real life pregnancy at that time but the surrogate storyline is just pure genius because the idea of it screams PHOEBE. It's just something Phoebe would do, that storyline add depth to her character. Chandler and Joey also had a character growth moment when the fought over a girl. Even though it had hilarious interludes, one cannot deny the true emotions some of those scenes brought.

1881674,2,B0000996IS,"Season 4 of the phenominal Friends' series certainly was not the high point of this show's ten-year stint. Briefly, the humor was dry and awkward, with almost every one of Chandler's lines coming totally from some uneasy self-consciousness. Typically, this season's humor made me want to cringe. Clearly, something significant had taken place this season in the directorial area. Also: what was up with all the boom mikes!?",1111363200,,423,5.235294117647059

He decides it should be Rachel, but he finds Bonnie in Rachel's room, where Rachel is rubbing sunburn soothing cream over Bonnie's bald-a** head, after Rachel convinced Bonnie to shave it. Ross breaks up with Bonnie and decides for sure that Rachel is the one he still wants to be with. Rachel has written Ross an 18-page letter, front and back, for Ross to read before they make their reunion official. He reads half of the letter, but falls asleep, due to the fact that he was up till 5:30 in the morning. Rachel comes down and asks what happened. Ross lies and says that he read the letter twice to be thoroughly clear on what Rachel wanted. Rachel asks, ""Does it?"" Ross, not knowing what Rachel is talking about, and decides that, ""...It does"". Rachel jumps into Ross' arms with joy. They are back together. YES! As she leaves, Ross looks at what Rachel meant. What he sees really pisses him off. We find out that Rachel meant that if Ross can take full responsibility for sleeping with someone else, she'll trust him again, to which she adds, ""...does that sound like something you can do?"" They have another fight, which causes them to break up for good.

  Meanwhile, Phoebe is told that her brother Frank Jr., is planning to wed Alice Knight, his high school Home Ec teacher. The two had eloped and are planning to start a family. Phoebe couldn't be more happier, until Frank and Alice reveal that they cannot conceive. They ask Phoebe to be the surragote for their child. Phoebe accepts and goes through with the proccess of a surragote artificial insemination. Frank and Alice's prayers had been answered, for the process was a success. Phoebe became pregnant. Later, they find out that Frank and Alice are not having a baby, but babies. Yes, they are having triplets.

  Monica winds up getting a new job at Alessandro's as head chef, where every waiter, waitress, and other chef's hate her guts, until she sets them straight, by hiring Joey as a waiter, just so she could fire him in front everybody, letting everybody know that she's the boss.

  Joey finds out he has a small role in a feature film, starring Charlton Heston, but that goes completely awry for Joey, after he returns from a three-day fishing trip, smelling like he hasn't bathed in five years.

  Ross meets the lovely british Emily Wathum. This affair set up by accident, for Rachel's boss is the uncle of Emily. He has requested that Rachel take Emily around New York, but Rachel has a date with Joshua, a man whom she has sold clothing to at her office in Bloomingdales. Ross and Emily fall madly in love and decide that they are to get married. Ross decides that he does not just want Chandler or Joey has best man, so Ross decides that both Chandler and Joey are perfect the job, where they serve as Ross' best men. The wedding is in London, and everyone is invited. Phoebe cannot go, for she is in her third trimester of her pregnancy. Rachel does not want to go because she still loves Ross with all her heart, but she comes with the excuse that she cannot get off work. But at the last minute, Rachel books a flight to tell Ross that she loves him dearly.

  On the morning before the wedding, we find that Monica and Chandler had slept together, and it seems that they are planning to spend the second night together. But they also plan to keep this affair a secret from the others.

  Rachel finally makes to London and sees Ross with Emily. She realizes that she cannot ruin the happiest day of his life. So, she gives him a congrats and hugs him dearly.

  The wedding is starting. Emily recites her vows first. Ross follows, but he makes the most outrageous mistake when he says Rachel's name instead of Emily's. Talk about a slap in the face.

This season is proberbly one of the more powerful seasons within the 10 year lifespan of the show. Unlike earlier/later seasons, season four still keeps it's comedy, as storylines are slowly forming.

My favourite episode within this season are 'TOW the embryos' 'TOW all the rugby' and 'TOW Ross' wedding'.

The people who say that this show is a lot of rubbish, not funny, and just another sitcom... they obviously are missing some brain cells. When you think about it, this season starts up everything that concludes in the last season.",1102204800,,901,5.074324324324325

1881703,5,B0000996IS,"I have not been enamored of television situation comedies in recent years, which would explain why I never watched ""Friends"" until I caught the cliffhanger at the end of the fourth season when Ross says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his wedding in London.  Then it was a question of getting caught up with the reruns and syndicated episodes to understand why this was not only funny but apparently a scene of some pathos.  In looking back at ""Friends: The Complete Fourth Season"" in the grand scheme of things, it seems clear that the reason this was the best season of ""Friends"" to that point was not just because all six of the cast members have their characters done but because the bottom was so high.  There is nothing as grand in this season as the endings of ""The One with the Prom Video"" or ""The One with the Proposal,"" but the only really bad average in the bunch is ""The One with the Worst Best Man Ever,"" which combines Phoebe's pregnant mood swings with Joey's idea of the ideal bachelor's party (watching most of the cast fly to Europe would have been more fun).
Once again, Ross and Rachel provide the season defining story arc, which begins with the ramifications of their being ""on a break"" and ends with Ross about to marry another woman.  However, in retrospect what stands out equally as much is how we begin with Chandler having to pee on Monica's jellyfish sting and ends with their jumping into bed together on the eve of the big wedding in London.  Lisa Kudrow's pregnancy forced the show to come up with the idea of Phoebe serving as a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife, which carries over to the next year, while the success the previous system with having Joey move out of the apartment spawns another roommate conflict when Chandler actually takes Kathy away from Joey.  Actually, the four episodes dealing with the Joey-Kathy-Chandler triangle are probably my favorites from season four.
Best episodes from the fourth season: ""The One with the Jellyfish,"" just to watch Monica, Chandler and Joey confessing what happened on the beach; ""The One with the Cat"" because it has Joey locked in an entertainment center; ""The One with the Cuffs"" because it has Chandler in cuffs but without pants; ""The One With Chandler in a Box"" because it has Chandler in a box (notice a theme here?); ""The One with the Emryos"" just for the final question in Ross' high-stake trivia contest that stumps Rachel and Monica; and ""The One with Ross's Wedding Part 1 & 2,"" not just for the cliffhanger but for the hired English cast highlighted by Fergie and Tom Conti.  You may or may not be impressed by the ability of the show to milk out more twists and turns from the Ross and Rachel traveling show, but the ability to take the gag about Chandler and Monica jumping into bed together and have that romance supplant the other one during the next two seasons is certainly impressive.",1072656000,4,2909,4.636893203883496
1881704,4,B0000996IS,"This series to me was always one of the more difficult series of Friends in that sometimes the emotional pull of the series overshadowed the comic edge that made Series 3 so awesome depsite the dramas that the Friends encountered.  That is not to say it isn't funny because it most definitely is, but at times it just lacks that punch for me.  Phoebe's birth of her brother's (!) triplets makes for some wonderful comedy of misunderstanding and a very touching 'goodbye' scene.  However it is Chandler's growing love for Joey's actress girlfriend, Kathy which commands the most respect in terms of the Friends' acting ability......but the most difficulty for this discerning viewer in terms of getting the comedy out of J & C's ailing friendship.  Rachel's aims to move up the career ladder are also cut short with the death of Joanna and Chandler's relationship with her doesn't make for the most convincing comedy of obstacles when Rachel objects, handcuffed to the filing cabinet or not!  There are some genuinely terrifik scenes and classic Friends moments however, my favourite being Phoebe's 'sexy phlegm' as she discovers a torch-song-singer vocal prowess, and also her home-made shoes.  Elsewhere the comedy just doesn't catch - see Ross trying to play football to impress Emily and Rachel's attempted cheerleading......funny yes, but not Friends funny.  Series 3 was so strong that perhaps it was hard to follow up, but when watching Series 5 after this one, you realise there were a few too many inadquacies, mainly driven by the more hard-hitting emotional dramas, the series ending with Rachel's realisation of her love for Ross as he's about to marry.  All that being said, this series still whips the ass off most tv out there, so still very worthy of 4 stars!",1069632000,3,1774,4.94949494949495

 The season sees both Ross and Rachel make up,then shortly break-up(""WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!)only to find themselves in new relationships,Chandler fall in love with Joey's new girlfriend,Phoebe agreeing to carry her brother Frank Jr.'s triplets,and Monica and Chandler finally consumating their relationship.
 The best episodes include The One with the Jellyfish,..with the Dirty Girl,..Chandler Crosses the Line/In A Box,.with the Embryos,..Ross's Wedding(I take thee Rachel<!!!!>).

It has had excellent ratings for years, and continues to be consistently funny every year. Sure, it has its low points, but even ""Seinfeld"" had episodes that weren't that funny.
Season 4 has such classics as TOW the Embryos, TOW the Worst Best Man Ever, and my personal favorite, TOW Chandler in a Box (Michael Vartan fans, this is the episode where he appears as Richard's son). These episodes alone make the DVD worth having. Now add 21 hilarious episodes to those, and that makes this the best buy ever.
