4399037,5,B004KZP82G,"For anybody who loves Rod Serling and ""The Twilight Zone,"" this is a must. It is Serling writing about himself as a young writer coming into the world of television and being addicted to the glamor and money it brought him.
The cast is terrific. Art Carney and Jack Klugman really give emmy deserving performances. For those who know their work from ""The Honeymooners"" and ""The Odd Couple,"" this shows how really great and versatile actors they were. Carney plays the writer who gets caught in the Hollywood game and Klugman plays his best friend and agent. There is also the joy of seeing Leslie Nielsen (""Forbidden Planet""/""Airplane""/""Police Squad"") as an alchoholic director and a very young Mickey Dolenz (""The Monkees"") as a loveable kid in the apartment building.
Unfortunately, the quality of the transfer is horrible. It looks like a bad VHS dubb off of a Kinetoscope (the film-machine used for copying television shows). It is hard to put up with the poor quality of the image, but the writing and acting is good enough to make you forget the low quality. I hope there is a decent copy of this 1959 program somewhere. I cannot believe that in 1959, CBS did not care about preserving the quality of its most popular and successful dramatic program - ""Playhouse 90""",1393804800,2,1272,4.786363636363636

Also appearing is a young Mickey Dolenz... who later found fame and fortune as a member of The Monkeys musical group.

If you look close... you'll see a young Burt Reynolds and Dyan Cannon playing a seducer.

4399043,4,B004KZP82G,"Being a Rod Serling fan, I've long wanted to see this ""Playhouse 90"" episode, ever since I watched the PBS ""American Masters"" piece on Serling.
I just watched it, and I have to say that it has that signature Serling theme of the consequences of people suddenly thrust into unfamiliar circumstances, so well done.
Art Carney plays Ernie, a struggling teleplay writer working for his big break, with Jack Klugman as Max, his ever-patient agent shepherding his scripts through to the TV studios.
Max recognizes the greatness of one of Ernie's scripts, honestly saying it was one of the finest things he has ever read, before he submits it to the studios.
Max's judgment turns out to be right, when the script is eagerly accepted, with a sizable (by late 1950s standards) offer.
That first script is the catalyst for all that follows, good and bad, but mostly bad.
There's greed, the notoriously cutthroat nature of the entertainment industry, the pressures of success, and the love and loyalty of an old friend and wife both in the balance.
Carney is outstanding, going from one extreme to the other, seemingly pulled by forces beyond his control, even as he willingly goes along with them.
Klugman is perfect in his portrayal of Max, a kind, sensitive man willing to go to the mat for Ernie.
Katharine Bard, as Ernie's wife, is also good, as we watch her transform from proud wife to regretful and justifiably distrustful of the Hollywood set.
Leslie Nielsen (and don't call me Shirley!) is also excellent, as a tired and desperate, but rapacious Hollywood exec with no compunction about whom he has to hurt to get what he wants.
I'm not going to spoil the ending, but just know that in his scripts Serling often greatly rewarded those who did the right thing and severely punished those who did wrong.
My one ding on this DVD is the poor picture and sound quality, poor even by Kinescope quality standards.
BY comparison, I have the VHS copy of Serling's original ""Playhouse 90"" (the TV version Jack Palance, NOT the theatrical release with Anthony Quinn) Emmy winning classic ""Requiem for a Heavyweight,"" and it easily edges this out in both sound and picture quality, even though ""Requiem"" came out in the same year.
I'm not sure why this one looks and sounds the way it does, but my guess is that either they did the original Kinescope transfer poorly, or the film they used to do it may have deteriorated.
Either way, I knew full well that this wouldn't be anything approaching HD, and the show still comes through.
I still highly recommend this moving story, something that will really get you thinking, long after the show is over.",1349568000,14,2636,4.745098039215686
4399044,3,B004KZP82G,"being a fan of early tv, i knew what i might be getting into regarding the potential lack of kinescope quality of this show.

the story is vintage Rod Serling as I hoped and the acting is top notch from Carney and Co, especially the always compelling Jack Klugman.

so if you can handle a picture that at times is very very washed out, but still want the performance no matter the pic quality, i think the show was very good.",1326585600,4,425,4.234567901234568

4399046,5,B004KZP82G,"It's a great TV Drama, but,...here's the problem. It's hard to justify spending $13 bucks (with postage) for just ""one"" episode of a black and white Kinescope hour and a half long 50's TV Show. It's just not a good deal, and it screams, ""Greedy."" Put ""four"" Playhouse 90 episodes on a DVD for the same amount of money, and then it might be worth it. In a time when you can download videos like this, or rent them from sources like Netflix for roughly $2 a piece, based on certain monthly minimums, you have to be competitive in your pricing. If this all sounds too mean to you, I'm sorry. But I live in reality world, not in never-never land.",1296518400,6,642,4.31404958677686

8433682,4,B004KZP82G,"Interesting reflection of what TV drama was 50 years ago.  It is typical Rod Serling dialog: overwritten, pessimistic, resigned to fruitless yet heroic striving.  This seems so dated in its sensibility and ethos.  I must believe that even in 1959 people already understood how fame and fortune, especially derived from such ephemera as television shows, was fleeting and soul-crushing.  Still, nobody says it better than Serling.  A worthy reflection of how the TV industry saw and portrayed itself, and aspired to make TV meaningful culturally.",1476921600,,545,5.364705882352941

The audio and video are very poor, however, making this even more of a challenge to watch.
