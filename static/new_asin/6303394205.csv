I saw some of these songs on YouTube and had to have my own copy.  Too bad it's not available in DVD.",1357171200,,369,4.630769230769231

634413,5,6303394205,"my cousin joyce mcdonald gave this tape to me in approx. 1997? I loved it then... lost it and finaly got an opportunity to replace it as it's in stock now.

I have never experimented with drugs. I don't know more than what I hear, ""PRAISE GOD!"" but, I've been without money to provide the things I felt necessary to promote self esteem for me, and been at time without hope....I thought?

this tape brings it home. right up in your face real!!! all the blessings we ignore.....what others went thru and OVERCAME with the grace of GOD....

you can't go wrong playing this for you and then a group of people.

I said I never did drugs, but I realize now, again, there go me but by the ""GRACE OF GOD."" buy it, ""SHARE IT!"" ENJOY IT!",1353888000,,728,4.253623188405797
634414,5,6303394205,"Having sung baritone in our church choir for years, I have always been drawn to Large choirs, large choruses and large glee clubs in concert. The more voices the better I like it. The greatest musical instrument ever created is the human voice. With nearly 200 human voices in the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir to lift my spirit heavenward, I revel in the majestic sounds that eminate from this large choral group. I hope it's a foretaste of what we can expect when all believers reach Beulah Land.",1351123200,,494,4.689655172413793

The video was in mint condition and I had it in my hands in record time!!",1304035200,,316,4.112903225806452
634416,5,6303394205,This video is simply awesome!  I cried like a blubbering baby the first time I saw this video.  I felt exactly how Calvin's wife felt when he came out of that dog house from using drugs and was compelled to get to the church while they were in the midst of having a powerful Prayer Service.  The testimonials in this video will have you to KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt the power of the Faithful God we serve!  What a BLESSING this video is!  I would like to see more of these type of videos from other popular choirs.  Buy it!  You won't be disappointed!,1082592000,5,557,4.149532710280374
