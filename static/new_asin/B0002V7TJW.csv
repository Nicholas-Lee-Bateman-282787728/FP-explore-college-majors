8032419,4,B0002V7TJW,"This is an engaging movie. Once I began to watch I was pulled in to the atypical story line and lead character, who is supposed to be a pimp. I stress the word ""supposed"" to be a pimp, because this is the biggest struggle pimp I have ever seen or heard of. Sugar has no game, no charisma, no real charm, no money, and he might as well have no prostitutes, because the one prostitute he does have is ill equipped to work.

Sugar is basically a nice guy with a big heart masquerading as a pimp. I kept waiting for him to say or do something pimpish, and that moment never came. There are some real pimps in the movie and interviews with real life prostitutes strewn throughout this movie too, which made the movie feel authentic. I just don't see how any prostitute would have chosen to be with Sugar with him being so devoid of pimp characteristics and living such a struggle lifestyle. The actress Ingrid Sonray is fly too. I enjoyed watching her on screen.

This is a good movie. It's just that with my familiarity with pimp culture and the fundamentals of attraction, the premise of Sugar Valentine being a "" legend"" as a Pimp seems far fetched.",1496016000,,1147,4.380281690140845

8032424,5,B0002V7TJW,"sugar valentine was not pimp material, and yes i have a bunch of pimp movies but overall it was a good view and worth the price.

sugar valentine brings po' pimpin' to reality...
that's all i can say about him
but there was drama and some more in this movie and if u like pimp flicks then this is one u should see; however sugar valentine will lack the glamour u seek in such films.
since it was based on a true story it makes it all more the interesting espcially since they have the real sugar valentine appear at the end",1188864000,,523,4.127450980392157
8032425,4,B0002V7TJW,"Sugar Valentine was a good movie that needed to tell the story and little bit more. It left you wondering what happened in between because it is a true story.

Sugar was a broke pimp that was trying to get his game back and in the meantime he fell in love with an undercover cop that took the little bit of his pimp game away.",1116115200,,326,4.015384615384615
