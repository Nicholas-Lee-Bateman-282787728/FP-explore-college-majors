8583490,4,B00CMQ90I8,"Generation Ax is from the same director of Crinoline Head. I didn't like it quite as much as Crinoline Head, but Generation Ax is still quite good. It's got clever dialogue and some very twisted horror stuff as well. Most of the violence is just implied, leaving the graphic stuff to the imagination.",1393200000,,300,4.679245283018868
8583491,5,B00CMQ90I8,"Being a huge fan of director Tommy Faircloth's first film, Crinoline Head, I could not wait to see his new one, Generation Ax.  You can tell he had more of a budget with this one.  Again, loved the vapid characters...I think he really likes bitchy girls...and the story was fun.  It's just like a love story wrapped around a slasher film.  I would be like taking Sixteen Candles and adding in Heathers and mixing it with an axe.  Loved it.  My favorite line was from the girl who won the spot on the cheer team telling two other girls, ""If I can do anything for you let me know, cause my father owns an abortion clinic and I can get free abortions anytime I want!""  You should check this out!",1366243200,,692,4.276923076923077
