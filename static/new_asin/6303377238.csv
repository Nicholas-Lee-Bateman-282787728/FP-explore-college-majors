7845677,3,6303377238,"The cast list in the description includes Steve Martin, Billy Van and others - they were part of ""Andy Williams presents Ray Stevens"" - an 8 episode summer replacement show NBC ran way back in 1970 - it did include former Smothers Brothers writer/future comic superstar Steve Martin along with Lulu, Mama Cass and more - it was kind of a surreal Hee Haw type show with some fine music thrown in - if anyone has a way of obtaining vids or DVD's of this show let me know (I was 10 at the time; we were gone most weekends that year so I only caught 1 episode)

What you will get here is a fun video from Ray Stevens Branson Theater show from the 90's.",1242691200,3,648,4.142857142857143
7845678,5,6303377238,"this home video came out in 1993. it was sold over television and print ads and it quickly reached Double-Platinum status. to be accurate, double-platinum for a home video requires sales of 200,000 copies or more (300,000 copies for Triple-Platinum, etc.) however, CDs and cassettes need a whopping 2,000,000 in sales to reach double-platinum, etc. with that in mind, Ray sold a ton of home videos in between 1992 and 1995. the RIAA reported that Ray's video sales were somewhere around 3,000,000...which is A LOT when you're dealing with the concept of home videos and, not to mention the unique approach of selling them over television and newspapers ads! Ray Stevens Live! captures moments recorded at his famed Branson, Missouri theatre in late 1992 and early 1993. for the record, Ray had his theatre up and running during the spring, summer, and fall months of 1991, 1992, and 1993 before growing ""bored and crazy"" with the exhaustive two shows a day/six days a week grind. on this first live video, (a second was only available to fan club members) we see Ray get introduced by his brother, John. Ray drives out on stage in his Hawaiian ""flowerty shirt"" on a harley davidson motorcycle, before launching into ""Shriner's Convention"". he then makes a few jokes about his love life before singing ""Can He Love You Half as Much As I?"" (a 1986 song). he exits the stage and his famed video screen dangles down to show a newsman, a reporter, and a bumpkin talking about a U.F.O. spotting. this leads into the song ""I Saw Elvis in a U.F.O."". Ray is decked out like Elvis and pink aliens are running all around the stage and they jump into the audience and start to run up and down the aisles. a spaceship hovers over-head and a puff of smoke bursts all over the stage and Ray/Elvis is beamed aboard the U.F.O.! after that bit of hilarity, Ray strolls out in a camel singing the first lines of ""Ahab the Arab""...but this leads into more joke-telling and a parody of James Bond and Johnny Rivers. ""Secret Agent Man"" is retitled ""Information Man"" as the song topic is geared toward pesky phone operators. further on we see Ray, Jane, and the monkey perform ""Gitarzan"". ""Sex Symbols"", a duet with his dummy named Julio, is next. after that, he launches into the subject of hats and he does a great impersonation of Gabby Hayes and Walter Brennen. the action cuts away before he can perform ""It's Me Again, Margaret"" (that performance is edited into the live volume two sequel from late 1993) but it instead shows his performance of ""You Gotta Have a Hat"", his 1991 song satirizing young country singers. things get serious with an abbreviated performance of ""Amazing Grace"" and this leads into ""Misty"". ""The Streak"" is the next song and he closes with ""Everything is Beautiful"". even though i gave away most of the concert, you have to see it visually to really appreciate it. Ray is one of the finest comedian/singer-songwriters that Nashville can call their own. Ray Stevens Live! gives you a peek at all the hilarity and mayhem that made his theatre consistently sold-out during his three season stay (1991, 1992, and 1993).",1044316800,13,3123,4.742647058823529
