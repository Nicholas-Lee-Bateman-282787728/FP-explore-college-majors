8301665,1,B001FB4ZB8,"This DVD is NOT worth buying, even for an avid RFK collector such as myself.  The running time of the DVD is less than 5 minutes! I was FURIOUS.  This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made in my life.  You'd probably be better off using the disc as a Frisbee than trying to glean any understanding of American history from it. If you're in the market for a DVD about Robert Kennedy, do yourself a favor and purchase a good documentary instead.",1229558400,4,450,4.270588235294118
8301666,1,B001FB4ZB8,"Having had a long time interest in and as a collector of RFK material, I thought the National Archives RFK Funeral dvd would be a poignant addition.  Much to my dismay, this 4 minute and 45 second dvd is a piece of crap put together by someone whose only interest is to make a quick dollar.  My anger over this deception is beyond words.",1228262400,6,337,4.25
