8705099,1,B00UB28K40,Horrible!  I bought this for my 10 year old son for christmas and the picture is HORRIBLE!  It changes colors while playing. It also looks like your watching negatives from developed pictures from walmart. It's not worth your money!,1482969600,,232,4.923076923076923

8705101,5,B00UB28K40,It's good to hear straight from Jason himself what he is doing !  Several fun interviews.  I recommend this cd .,1456099200,,112,4.285714285714286
8705102,5,B00UB28K40,"Jason's a man of few words, although they're often very well chosen, so I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD hearing him discuss his music and his career - as the other reviewer rightly states, the discussions aren't in chronological order, and it would have been helpful to have onscreen titles letting us know the year the interviews were taking place - but that's a minor criticism - overall, great DVD!",1440028800,,399,4.797101449275362
