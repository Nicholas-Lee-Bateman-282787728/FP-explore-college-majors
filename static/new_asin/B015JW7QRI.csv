8733833,4,B015JW7QRI,"This profiles a group of youths who aspire to qualify for the Olympics in table tennis. Features their training, practice, and media commitments. Says that player of Beer Pong get more notice then these players receive. Insightful.",1478995200,,231,5.27027027027027
8733834,5,B015JW7QRI,"I saw this movie on Fusion and none of my friends got to see it. If you are a serious table tennis player, you already know these three are part of the future of the sport in the United States.  Men's team ranks below the 50th country and the women's team is at least around 25.  In order to get better, we need dedicated players.  This documentary is the best video on what it takes to become internationally ranked I've ever seen.  You can watch tournament videos and instructional videos, but none of them show the work and sacrifice necessary to be world class like this one.  For those not serious players, the players are teen-agers and all three are charming enough to warrant your interest and you may discover the difference between ping pong and table tennis along with a new appreciation of the sport.",1476748800,,812,4.534246575342466

8733836,5,B015JW7QRI,"The only other ping pong film I'd seen was Ping Pong Playa (also highly enjoyable) when a friend introduced me to this documentary.  Easily engrossing, with a good mix of humor and poignancy, this film left me with a much greater respect for high levels of table tennis play.",1456531200,3,275,4.612244897959184

Well made, great athletes, and really fun to watch, Anyone considering any competing for professional sport should see this film. It is available for streaming elsewhere.",1452729600,,310,4.636363636363637

Im still amazed by how documentary filmmakers work  especially those who make what I guess could be called linear films, like this one, where they fund a subject (or in this case, three subjects) and follow them through a challenges or competition. Ive seen similar films re: basketball (Hoop Dreams) and pastry chef competitions. The filmmaker has no idea whether the person will win or lose.

The subject here is the amateur sport of Ping Pong and how three young American players progress from local completion to a (possible) berth on the US Olympic Team for the 2012 Olympics (where the sport is dominated by the Chinese). There were originally 5 or 6 players who the filmmakers chose have chosen to follow but they chose two Asian-American women and one Caucasian male. And, I think they made a good choice. Each has their own personality.

I won't tell you if each of the players won or lost  thats a spoiler. But  win or lose  it was great to learn that they all pursed top college educations.
Ill admit that watch two people batting a small plastic ball can get boring after a while and  , at one point, I wished for a few less games shown but the upbeat music did make it less boring.

The DVD has a half-dozen deleted scenes of 1-2 minutes and one extended scene of a photo show for a fancy ping pong nightclub (called SPIN) in Manhattan. (Yes, youll learn there are such places!)

I enjoyed it and, if you like these linear-type documentaries, you probably will too.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
