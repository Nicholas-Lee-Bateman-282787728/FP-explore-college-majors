8641398,5,B00IE4EQLS,"Excellent series on the origin and early history of the railroad in the country that pioneered them, the United Kingdom.  Dan does such a great job in delivery of his documentaries, and this one is no different.  As a railroad aficionado, I was greatly impressed with the information that I wasn't aware of...not details of how steam locomotive work or technology of a railroad, but the huge impact and importance that the early railroads had on the industrial revolution and the world.  Interestingly enough, someone who is not a rail fan at all also watched it and was equally impressed.  Which is the genius of how Dan presents, it doesn't matter your knowledge level or interest in railroads, you will get drawn in and find it very interesting.",1482710400,,748,4.8203125
