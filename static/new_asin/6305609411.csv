7892687,1,6305609411,"One of the most boring horror films ive seen in a long time. I recently watched this on netflix last night horrible acting hilarious killer a demon barney costume that is pathetic in more ways then one.

The deaths are bloodless badly done and boring as is this entire film as well.

Skip it seriously watching paint dry is more interesting then this boring waste of time.",1333670400,,372,4.537313432835821
7892688,1,6305609411,was this a 14 time grammy winner? who would spend $98.00 on this movie. not me....the movie is ok.. cheesy to the extreme....Defintely Not Worthed That much.......Otherwise Below B Movie........,1201737600,,194,5.5
7892689,3,6305609411,"I got my copy of ""The Stay Awake"" for under $10 and it's now going for $98 online?  Good lord, that's obscene.  This is an OK movie, but it's by no means worth that much money and anyone that spends that much for it is obviously more insane than the people pricing it that way.  And now for the story, well, a bunch of girls in some school are stalked by some serial killer's ghost that inexplicably ended up in Europe after being executed in the US. Even though this is a South African movie.  Go figure. And you WILL be fighting to stay awake at times, although for some reason I really did like this, sort of.  Anyway it is DEFINITELY not worth any $98.",1175040000,2,656,4.174603174603175
7892690,1,6305609411,"I LOVE the horror genre, the good ones, the ""bad"" ones, even the cheesey '80s ones. But this movie is just AWFUL. Let me say that again, this movie is just AWFUL. The ""plot"" is so thin and less than interesting, you barely even know any of the character's names so don't expect to feel anything when they get killed (actually, you might pray for them to get killed because: 1) the acting is beyond awful and 2) it would create some action on the screen, and lastly...the special effects are really not very special. I've seen scarrier plug in animatronic Christmas figures.
Don't waste any time or money on this movie. The producers didn't.",1034294400,4,640,4.573913043478261
