I don't know how they got all the film festival accolades advertised on the dvd cover?  That's why I bought it.  Can you buy the little olive-wreath symbols on ebay and stick them on your on dvd?  I was suspicious of the movie's quality from the start when the opening scene has a young woman in bed screaming her head off.  Ooooooo, real scary.  After feeling ill from watching the half of it, I checked on IMDB and see it had a 3.5, but only because one of the seven reviewers gave it a 10 while the other six gave it a 1 or 2!  The reviewer that gave it a 10 must have been on drugs.
I don't know how people get movies like this produced.  What idiot would put money into crap like this!  I wish Amazon had a zero star!",1363910400,4,815,3.9753086419753085
4653760,1,B005COLF1W,"I do not know what the positive reviewers of this film are talking about.  Got this film in March of '12 and I was completely bored and unimpressed with anything about it, production or story.  Watch this for free if you have to see it, but don't buy it 'cause it's not worth the shipping.",1345075200,,289,4.236363636363636

4653762,5,B005COLF1W,"This is a very well-made independent film, and it is a great thriller!  I don't usually like ""scary"" movies, but this one is very well done and quite clever, so I really enjoyed it.  The ending is particularly haunting and thought-provoking.  Check it out!",1329350400,2,256,4.7727272727272725
4653763,2,B005COLF1W,"Ever since 1957's classic INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, film-makers have used the scenario of alien possession on multiple occasions.  GREY SKIES is one of those movies.
A group of friends gather for a reunion in an isolated lodge in Michigan.  Guests include a newly engaged couple, a gay couple, a player and his new conquest, and a single sullen lady with her own secret.  On the first night, a strange meteor-like light impacts the nearby woods and the next day strange things start happening.
The problem with GREY SKIES is its slow beginning.  While necessary to develop characterization, this movie's characters and actors aren't particularly interesting.  Things pick up once we realize what's going on and a steady level of suspense is maintained. The creatures aren't shown in full detail and the movie's bizarre opening is never truly integrated into the story.
GREY SKIES looks nice at times, but ultimately is no match for the classic pod people.",1321920000,6,961,5.018867924528302
4653764,5,B005COLF1W,"I am not the biggest horror genre fan, but this movie has it all, suspense, sex, horror, and even includes some comedic moments, especially from Michael Cornacchia.  Phenomenal location, strong script and characters, acting is very well done, and the aliens are perfectly creepy.  I saw this at the Michigan premiere in Mt Pleasant, and couldn't wait till it finally got a dvd release.",1318896000,,385,5.0
4653765,5,B005COLF1W,"Horror fans I highly recommend this movie. It has all ingredients of our favorite slasher flicks (sex,drugs,colorful characters,isolated cabin in the woods,etc.) but instead of homicidal maniac or demons, it involves aliens. I believe anyone that checks this out will not be disappointed. This is one of the few lesser known movies that drives me crazy wondering how many great movies I've been missing.",1318377600,6,403,5.3125
8465744,1,B005COLF1W,"Some of the most annoying, mouthy characters I've ever seen in a film. I just wanted everyone to die and get it over with. Why aliens would have chosen this group I'll never understand.",1467331200,,185,4.470588235294118
8465745,5,B005COLF1W,"I really liked this movie. The setting was creepy, the panic seemed legit and can I just say this...the non-'famous' actors made it more 'believable' for me. I wish I could buy it on Amazon Instant video, bc I likely would.",1445040000,,223,4.463414634146342

Robert (Aaron McPherson) organized the get together. He has been fighting with his girlfriend Jenny (Stacy Jorgensen) as he took off for a week after their last fight. They are joined by Michael (Michael Cornacchia) who supplies us attempts at comedy. His boy toy photographer friend Brian (Jeff Schuetze) comes along too. Hayden (Jeff Lorch) is the third buddy who brings along his girl Sandy (Shelley Dennis). Annie (Anne Griffin) a mutual friend of the fighting couple comes too to add to the tension because fighting Greys isn't enough to hold our interest.

I think you got the general idea. The characters were decent. They were able to effectively develop a large number of characters in a short span of time while still keeping the plot moving. The problem is that the horror aspect was low even when the Greys were there. Okay, Alien being that mean us no harm and plot spoiler: No one is dying. They are just ""rats in a maze.""  I didn't feel it.

8465753,1,B005COLF1W,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  A complete waste of time.  The story is pointless, the beginning has no connection the rest of the movie and acting is very poor.  Choose some other movie.",1364860800,2,206,4.230769230769231
