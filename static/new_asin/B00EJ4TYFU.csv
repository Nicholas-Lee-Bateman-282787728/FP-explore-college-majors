8605905,5,B00EJ4TYFU,"Stockinger was a two season German detective series set in Salzburg Austria. The detective is very much a brilliant sleuth but hopeless at general life.  In that respect this has a Columbo like flavor.  The series is actually a spin-off from the very popular  -- and also worth seeing Kommissar/Inspector Rex -- the detective show with a brilliant German Shepherd in the lead.

Stocki has great co-stars -- a beautiful wife who takes over her father's dental practice in Salzburg, a physicial fitness nut for a co-inspector/office mate, a cerebral boss who hilariously philosophizes over minutia, and a local policeman who horns in on Stocki's cases and tries to solve them via examples from American crime films. Perhaps the greatest co-star in this series is the alpine scenery -- I've never seen more beautiful surroundings in a TV series - or pretty much anywhere else. The stories have some violence and nudity, and the language is German -- but the Australian made DVD sets have clear English subtitles  - so don't pass this series up due to that.  If you are a fan of good detective stories, Alpine scenery and culture, or a student of the German language, this (and Inspector Rex) are a series to get.",1407542400,2,1209,4.816425120772947
8605906,5,B00EJ4TYFU,"The series is a quirky late-20th century police mystery set in and around Salzburg, Austria. Stockinger, the main character, comes from the first incarnation of the Inspector Rex series from Austria. The actors can act, the settings are engaging, and the plotting is really very good. There are no great throes of panic or passion, no revealing social comment, but the shows tend to be humorous. Enjoyable.",1365465600,2,406,5.074626865671642
