It's actually true of a lot of indie horror, too. New writers, I think, neglect to give us full personalities of the characters, and the ones that do, often just list off a character's history points in a conversation or something.

""untitled"" didn't do that. The characters are well fleshed-out for the viewers through observation. We get to see who they really are through good scripting and full dialogues. That takes a lot of patience to work through. The bad and the good of each person is shown, and I think it was brave of the writer(s) to do that with such a small cast. Plus, as characters change because of events going on (I don't want to give anything away by being too specific) the changes are noteworthy because you somewhat know each character by that point.

The character of ""the house"" however, wasn't quite as well presented. The house's history and haunting was revealed mostly the way I described indie horror characters to be done, with its personality being told through a list of unfeeling historical facts. This film definitely had a story, but there was no feeling or building intrigue regarding how that story was to be revealed. So the fear factor and the plot development of the movie are lacking. The plot is therefore a bit predictable and thin. Still, it is better than most films at this level. This film is head and shoulders above new filmmaker indies. You can clearly see the talent in the writing, and I bet if the writer had had more money, time, and seasoned crew members in employee the character of ""the house"" would have been as well crafted as the four humans.

I thought the acting was consistent for 4 actors on this level. The technical aspects, the editing, photography, set designs and direction were all pretty impressive for this level film making. The direction is especially impressive and must have taken patience. There's a lot of dialogue but it's all so smooth. There aren't missteps, or bumbles, or odd delays. The fiilmmaker must have done a good deal of rehearsing, working with the crew, and reshooting to achieve this. That's a lot of hard work. The very worst thing you could say about the technicals is that there are some spots where the sound could have been better. They are all compensated with the use of subtitling. It doesn't detract from the movie at all.

I've said this in reviews so many times and I'll say it again. I want to see more indie horror, so I always want to encourage new filmmakers to keep going and try again. I hope any criticism I give is taken in the spirit I intended, and not misconstrued as mean. I hope we see more from Shaun Troke (and Steve Jarrett).

By the way I watched this on youtube on what I think is the filmmaker's channel. There are outtakes, status identities, and deleted scenes in that channel's posted videos that are well worth checking out.",1482796800,2,3031,4.657943925233645
