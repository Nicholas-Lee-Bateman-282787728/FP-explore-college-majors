3063054,5,B00116RCWG,"This video, on one DVD, is similar in quality and subject matter to the several other excellent 'Visions of Europe' series of DVDs.  The differences seem to be that the narrator talks more, and there are more street-level shots of quaint downtown areas and more ground level shots of the countryside.  But it all works.  This is a striking collection of views of Ireland, with appropriate music.

The narrator stresses the long-time ""historical sadness"" of Ireland, how it has boomed economically since peace has set in, and the beauty and varied history of Ireland.  The video also shows a lot of new construction of buildings occurring in the larger cities.

The video has lots of views of picturesque small towns, farms and country homes, harbors, bays, rivers, old castles (some in good condition, some not), stone fences, stone monuments, stone huts, stone bridges, lighthouses, beaches, very rugged shortlines, very rugged islands, big cities and their wonderful old downtown streets, colleges, churches, cathdedrals, and ancient mounds and burial sites.

Altogether just as nice as a trip to Ireland, without the expense and trouble of a trip, and the likely chance of bad weather.  My favorite scenes are:  (1) Gardens at Mount Stewart (2) Sunbeams on the coast at Galway Bay (3) Island of Skelling Michael, and (4) Cliffs of Moher.",1212451200,34,1340,5.082191780821918
3063055,5,B00116RCWG,This is a beautiful and breathtaking video . Scenery was out of this world and I am extremely glad I bought it,1211155200,,110,4.045454545454546
3063056,5,B00116RCWG,"Much like most of you out there I first became acquainted with the `Vision Series' of aerial travelogue features on PBS television. Whenever I came upon one while channel surfing I'd immediately put the remote down and sit back and relax. It wasn't long before I decided these programs were something I'd never tire of watching and needed to be added to my private DVD collection.

Released in '08, `Visions of Ireland' is the seventh high altitude tour in the series following `Visions of ... Greece / Italy / England / France / Germany and Scotland.' As with the previous journeys the audience is whisked away from the daily concerns of life on the ground to view Ireland in all its magnificent natural, rustic beauty. Add to the visuals a haunting Celtic laden soundtrack and narration you'll soon think you're really there! By the way, do you happen to know the way to the nearest pub?",1208131200,27,889,4.698717948717949
3063057,5,B00116RCWG,Excellent video. Background music not so load you can't hear the commentary. Makes us home-sick.,1207699200,2,96,5.466666666666667
3063058,5,B00116RCWG,I bought several copiesof this DVD for my family as a gift for St.  Particks's Day. I told them I was giving them a trip to Ireland. I have been there two times and this DVD is a trip to Ireland.,1207353600,7,195,3.7560975609756095
3063059,4,B00116RCWG,"We were first ""turned-on"" to these videos when we started shopping for big screen TV's at the local box electronics stores.  When we browsed the sets at BJ's Club, Circuit City and Best Buy we often found ourselves bombarded by twenty huge TV screens simultaneously playing scenes from various Mediterranean locales.  We were so intrigued that we immediately bought Visions of Greece and Italy to watch on our new big screen TV.  We loved them so much that we soon ordered the German travelogue.  We loved that too.  When Amazon suggested that I might be interested in their Visions of Ireland DVD.  The price was right so we ordered.

The first five minutes of the Irish story were interesting with the sweeping vistas of lush green fields, ruined castles and rugged seaside coastline.  But whereas the German, Italian and Greek DVD's continued to hold our interest throughout the 2 hours of footage, the wife and I grew bored with the Irish scenery.  Sure it's beautiful there and there's a good deal of history but we felt that there was a certain dearth of anything that kept my attention.  It's kind of like ""once you've seen one field full of sheep, you've seen that all"".  When the wife fell asleep about 45 minutes into the story I switched to watching a hockey game instead.  Yawnfest.

To be honest, we are NOT Irish and though we've visited there twice I wasn't all that intrigued by the place seeing Ireland in person.  I suspect that one with Irish blood running through their veins might have a totally different view.  I find Scandanavia fascinating and enthralling while most of my friends think it's boring.

The video itself is very well-made.  Excellent photography, nice music and narration.  The price isn't bad either.  But I would recommend it only to Irish fans.",1207353600,3,1786,4.777777777777778

3063062,5,B00116RCWG,I purchased this for my mom for our St Patricks day celebration.  We all watched it before our dinner of Irish beef stew.  We all thought it was beautiful and really enjoyed listening to the narrator and the lovely music.

3063072,5,B00116RCWG,Item as described. Was a gift for my Irish mother-in-law. She was very impressed with both the scenery and the music and she watches it often . Good price and fast shipping. Thank you.,1405036800,,184,4.4411764705882355

3063074,5,B00116RCWG,Nice video--saw a lot of the places on the video on my trip to Ireland.  Highly recommend if you're planning a trip or just want to see the beautiful country,1396137600,,157,4.233333333333333
3063075,2,B00116RCWG,"Found this dvd very disappointing. The Quality of the program wasn't great. It appeared no better than a dvd recorded off the tv. I did not feel I got value for my money.
Scenery was nice",1396137600,,187,4.222222222222222
3063076,5,B00116RCWG,"It came in portions that I could watch and proper lengths.  Difficult for me to sit 2 hours.
The color was vibrant and the fact that PBS either produced this or at least showed it meant to me that it had quality.",1395619200,,212,4.0476190476190474
3063077,3,B00116RCWG,"I really liked it, but my Husband was bored with it.  So it is rather subjective..but definitely worth a try if you love Ireland like I do !",1394236800,2,140,4.0
3063078,4,B00116RCWG,"This was better than just OK but I liked In Search Of Ancient Ireland a lot better, esp w/ the bonus feature of Over Ireland.  In the bonus feature on this one there was a lot of repetition of what was in the featured one.  Also, there were a lot of shots just following a road instead of showing the countryside around it.  The music was good, for the most part.  There was 2 songs by someone who sounded like Bing Crosby--it might have even been him--but w/ all the good Celtic music out there I could have done without those.  There's really good scenery, tho, so I'm glad I have it.",1389052800,,586,4.196428571428571
3063079,4,B00116RCWG,This was actually a DVD for my brother for Christmas because he will be visiting Ireland next year . I asked him how he would rate the DVD and he said he really enjoyed watching it and made him want to see Irelsnd even more !,1388880000,,225,3.9130434782608696
3063080,5,B00116RCWG,"This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift so it has not been opened and viewed. My daughter and son-in-law went to Ireland in March and toured the countryside and took part in the People's Parade. They took a bus tour visiting sites of interest. I thought this would make a perfect gift to relive, and enjoy their once in a lifetime Irish experience.",1378684800,,351,4.5
3063081,5,B00116RCWG,Just loved this video.  We have visited Ireland twice and find the video exceptionally representative of the courntry!  We have shared it with many of our friends and family.,1378598400,,174,4.9655172413793105

3063083,5,B00116RCWG,"I enjoy viewing this DVD over and over - when I miss Ireland, which is often, it's so nice to have the option to fly over some beautiful places.  If you love Ireland, you should have this on  your shelf.",1374019200,,203,4.05
3063084,5,B00116RCWG,"Gave it to a friend of mine who  - with her husband - was born in Ireland. They both watched it and loved it.
It brought back so many memories for this couple who can no longer travel.",1368489600,,184,3.8421052631578947
3063085,5,B00116RCWG,"The scenery was beautiful and the music and narrative were just right. Some of the travel videos involve a lengthy explanation of city life, however this showed a great deal of the beautiful countryside of Ireland.",1365984000,,214,4.972222222222222
3063086,5,B00116RCWG,"I loved it.  If I can't afford to go there,this is the next best thing.  I was watching this video at my Doctors office and decided to buy it.",1365465600,,142,3.8620689655172415
3063087,3,B00116RCWG,"Germany from above is better, but I have not been able to find it in English. So this was 'in lieu' of, but I would prefer the other.",1354233600,,133,3.7857142857142856
3063088,5,B00116RCWG,Hi - my wife and I bought this for my 2 aunts and our grandma. They are all Irish and the feedback we got from them is that they loved it. They loved the places it showed and everything that it covered. Great gift for anyone with any desire to go to Ireland or can't afford to go and wants to learn more about it.,1352764800,,313,3.830769230769231
3063089,5,B00116RCWG,I only recently discovered the wonderful Visions series and have fallen in love with them. Having a love for flying I enjoy soaring over the country side just for itself and never tire of it. But this series adds something to it and that is looking down on the emerald isle with all its ruins and greenery. The first few times is seeing new sights from a great perspective. I've visited Ireland but could never see it like is viewed on this DVD. But after a few viewings it becomes a great source of relaxation and I have not tired yet of seeing the same sites over and over. It is like coming home and viewing favorite landmarks. I look forward to getting the whole series especially the new one of the Holy Land.,1282694400,,714,4.335820895522388
3063090,5,B00116RCWG,"I always wanted to go to Ireland but I never got there. This beautiful DVD is the next best thing. In fact, this shows you places and views that you would not likely see in person. It is thorough and very lovely. We will watch it again and again.",1272153600,,246,4.040816326530612
3063091,5,B00116RCWG,"Guess it's my own fault for not verifying that since the PBS version I viewed was in HD, that I would NOT be purchasing one that is NOT in HD.  The DVD itself contains wonderful aerials of Ireland, wonderful music and the perfect amount of narration, but to NOT view it in HD is a real let-down!  Guess I should have purchased it for $175 on PBS during their membership drive.",1271376000,,376,4.28169014084507
3063092,5,B00116RCWG,This is a film with good pict quality and the landscapes are really awesome. If you plan to visit ireland don't miss to review this dvd first. Ir is a shame it doesnt come on blu ray.,1243123200,,183,3.972972972972973

VISIONS OF IRELAND showcases the land of saints and scholars like never before. A helicopter-mounted camera shares the vantage point of the Irish faeries of ancient lore for serene aerial views above the fog and mist, the remote Skellig Islands, the magnificent windswept Cliffs of Moher - and the perfect angle from which to kiss the Blarney Stone.

The ""Emerald Isle"" is a place where myth and legend coexist with a booming modern legacy of invigorated economic strength. VISIONS OF IRELAND reveals all its ""forty shades of green"" following an itinerary from Belfast to Galway to Dublin that explores timeless country glens, abundant fishing ports, the famous golf courses of counties Kerry and Cork, and more  all the way to Tipperary. Rich narration gives context for the stunning high definition aerial and ground views of this little island of grand historical significance, all set to a soundtrack that includes the fiddles and pipes of traditional jigs and reels and modern Celtic rock.",1234915200,5,1276,5.429292929292929
3063095,5,B00116RCWG,This video was a gift for my mother-in-law.  Our family watched it with her.  We all enjoyed the footage of the amazing scenery and the narration.  My m.i.l. loves the video and she continues to enjoy it.,1233014400,,204,4.45945945945946
3063096,4,B00116RCWG,"The shots taken from a helicopter or plane are really pretty.  This was a good follow up to my visit to Ireland.  Shows a lot of things I did not get to see in person.  This is not a ""travelog"" and does not have a lot facts, information and voice over. No travel advice.  But, it is visually beautiful and shows all areas of Ireland.  I also got the disk on England and the one for Scotland.",1226793600,4,391,4.025974025974026
3063097,2,B00116RCWG,"Barely acceptable addition to this series with a distorted sense of geography. Several highlights ignored. Some pretty pictures, however. Select instead ""Over Ireland"" which is a five-star tour with excellent music and narration.",1217030400,15,229,5.96969696969697
3063098,5,B00116RCWG,"If you want a wonderful ""armchair travel"" visit to Ireland, this is one of best DVDs.  It is an aerial view of Erin's Green Isle with beautiful filming of the countryside, from mountains and valleys to lakes, rivers, the awesome west coast with Cliffs of Moher (about 700-800 feet high!) and other wondrous sights.  Small town life as well as city life are included.  Having toured Ireland in early November 2007 I am especially smitten by this wide ranging filming of the diversity and incredible beauty of the country.

3297573,5,B00116RCWG,"It came in portions that I could watch and proper lengths.  Difficult for me to sit 2 hours.
The color was vibrant and the fact that PBS either produced this or at least showed it meant to me that it had quality.",1395619200,,212,4.0476190476190474
3297574,3,B00116RCWG,"I really liked it, but my Husband was bored with it.  So it is rather subjective..but definitely worth a try if you love Ireland like I do !",1394236800,2,140,4.0
3297575,4,B00116RCWG,"This was better than just OK but I liked In Search Of Ancient Ireland a lot better, esp w/ the bonus feature of Over Ireland.  In the bonus feature on this one there was a lot of repetition of what was in the featured one.  Also, there were a lot of shots just following a road instead of showing the countryside around it.  The music was good, for the most part.  There was 2 songs by someone who sounded like Bing Crosby--it might have even been him--but w/ all the good Celtic music out there I could have done without those.  There's really good scenery, tho, so I'm glad I have it.",1389052800,,586,4.196428571428571

3297577,5,B00116RCWG,"This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift so it has not been opened and viewed. My daughter and son-in-law went to Ireland in March and toured the countryside and took part in the People's Parade. They took a bus tour visiting sites of interest. I thought this would make a perfect gift to relive, and enjoy their once in a lifetime Irish experience.",1378684800,,351,4.5

3297580,5,B00116RCWG,"I enjoy viewing this DVD over and over - when I miss Ireland, which is often, it's so nice to have the option to fly over some beautiful places.  If you love Ireland, you should have this on  your shelf.",1374019200,,203,4.05

3297585,5,B00116RCWG,Hi - my wife and I bought this for my 2 aunts and our grandma. They are all Irish and the feedback we got from them is that they loved it. They loved the places it showed and everything that it covered. Great gift for anyone with any desire to go to Ireland or can't afford to go and wants to learn more about it.,1352764800,,313,3.830769230769231
3297586,5,B00116RCWG,I only recently discovered the wonderful Visions series and have fallen in love with them. Having a love for flying I enjoy soaring over the country side just for itself and never tire of it. But this series adds something to it and that is looking down on the emerald isle with all its ruins and greenery. The first few times is seeing new sights from a great perspective. I've visited Ireland but could never see it like is viewed on this DVD. But after a few viewings it becomes a great source of relaxation and I have not tired yet of seeing the same sites over and over. It is like coming home and viewing favorite landmarks. I look forward to getting the whole series especially the new one of the Holy Land.,1282694400,,714,4.335820895522388

3297588,5,B00116RCWG,"Guess it's my own fault for not verifying that since the PBS version I viewed was in HD, that I would NOT be purchasing one that is NOT in HD.  The DVD itself contains wonderful aerials of Ireland, wonderful music and the perfect amount of narration, but to NOT view it in HD is a real let-down!  Guess I should have purchased it for $175 on PBS during their membership drive.",1271376000,,376,4.28169014084507

VISIONS OF IRELAND showcases the land of saints and scholars like never before. A helicopter-mounted camera shares the vantage point of the Irish faeries of ancient lore for serene aerial views above the fog and mist, the remote Skellig Islands, the magnificent windswept Cliffs of Moher - and the perfect angle from which to kiss the Blarney Stone.

The ""Emerald Isle"" is a place where myth and legend coexist with a booming modern legacy of invigorated economic strength. VISIONS OF IRELAND reveals all its ""forty shades of green"" following an itinerary from Belfast to Galway to Dublin that explores timeless country glens, abundant fishing ports, the famous golf courses of counties Kerry and Cork, and more  all the way to Tipperary. Rich narration gives context for the stunning high definition aerial and ground views of this little island of grand historical significance, all set to a soundtrack that includes the fiddles and pipes of traditional jigs and reels and modern Celtic rock.",1234915200,5,1276,5.429292929292929

3297593,4,B00116RCWG,"The shots taken from a helicopter or plane are really pretty.  This was a good follow up to my visit to Ireland.  Shows a lot of things I did not get to see in person.  This is not a ""travelog"" and does not have a lot facts, information and voice over. No travel advice.  But, it is visually beautiful and shows all areas of Ireland.  I also got the disk on England and the one for Scotland.",1226793600,4,391,4.025974025974026

3297595,5,B00116RCWG,"If you want a wonderful ""armchair travel"" visit to Ireland, this is one of best DVDs.  It is an aerial view of Erin's Green Isle with beautiful filming of the countryside, from mountains and valleys to lakes, rivers, the awesome west coast with Cliffs of Moher (about 700-800 feet high!) and other wondrous sights.  Small town life as well as city life are included.  Having toured Ireland in early November 2007 I am especially smitten by this wide ranging filming of the diversity and incredible beauty of the country.

8240863,5,B00116RCWG,"I had the amazing opportunity to go on an 11 day trip to Ireland with my husband back in the fall of 2014. We loved it there. It is probably the most beautiful place I have ever seen. To always remember the beauty of the land and relive our memories, we purchased the Visions of Ireland DVD. The movie is phenomenal and well put together by Public Television. The narrator is engaging, the views are stunning, and the music is absolutely beautiful. There were moments during the movie, like the scenes of the Skellig Islands, that left me chills. I honestly cannot think of anything that I disliked about the movie. If you are interested in beautiful scenery, have a desire to visit Ireland, or have been to Ireland and would like to take a trip down memory lane, then this is an excellent movie for you. AND if you like this DVD, then you will have to try other movies in the ""Visions of"" series. This one is my favorite, but Scotland is a close second!",1467590400,,954,4.395480225988701
