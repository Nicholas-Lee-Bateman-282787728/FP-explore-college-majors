8482591,1,B005PQ5XPG,"Sorry, but I wanted the DVD and didn't realize that it was just a download to a Kindle or other media.  Had to go back and find the DVD to buy.",1353801600,,143,3.6129032258064515
8482592,1,B005PQ5XPG,"So sorry I purchased this product.  Had to return it immediately.  Very poor videography, subject matter adolescent scenery of no interest or creativity.
Off subject music clashed with video being shown.  Also, poor photographic quality in most scenes.  I'd skip this one.",1353110400,3,272,5.404761904761905
