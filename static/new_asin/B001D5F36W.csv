8291800,2,B001D5F36W,"OK, the producer and director of this one had a promising idea.  Darian Caine is cast as a serious writer who finds herself working for an erotic-story-magazine for women.  A.J. Khan is her publisher, and A.J. really thinks highly of Darian's writing style.  So far, so good.

The problem is, Darian has no style.  She's shown gyrating with her laptop while wearing next to nothing, and then we see what she's supposedly writing about.  It's always just a couple of women going at it for no particular reason.  There's nothing remotely erotic about it.  If either the director or producer had some talent this one could have been really hot, but neither had any idea regarding how to set-up an erotic intro.

The production work here was sound, and all of the women involved are incredibly hot.  But creativity was lacking.  At one point Darian submits her latest story to A.J., and the two start going at it right then and there.  Again, if this was supposed to be about an incredibly gifted female writer of lesbian erotica it fell flat.  It's just one mechanical girl/girl scene after another.

One scene started out with a girl in handcuffs and a woman with a whip.  But there was no sub/dom bondage element involved beyond that.  Both women instead simply take turns doing eachother, the same as in all of the other scenes.  This video was very sadly a waste of some really beautiful actresses.",1239062400,,1399,4.691358024691358
8291801,4,B001D5F36W,"Three newcomers appear in this Seduction Cinema offering, but fans will be glad to know that regulars Darian Caine, Jackie Stevens and A.J. Khan have plenty of screen time too. Unfortunately, the new recruits are not identified properly in the credits (this is becoming something of an irritating habit that Seduction Cinema and its associated labels have gotten into of late - please sort it out, chaps). Their names are Jenna Jones, Juliet Janes and Claire Davenport, but there's no way of knowing who's who among this delightful trio.

Darian takes up residence in a new town and, this being a skin-flick, takes all her clothes off and slips into something more comfortable before getting down to the serious business of finding gainful employment. Despite her glaring lack of prowess on the keyboard, Darian is an ambitious journalist, and, on seeing an advertisement for a writer in the local newspaper, finds herself in a job interview with A.J, Khan. Hmm, a job interview with A.J. Khan. Brings back memories of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Vixens/dp/B00006G8GH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Vixens</a>&nbsp;when Darian and Katie Jordon presented themselves as candidates for a new job and A.J. took down their particulars. Lovely technique.

Anyhow, A.J. explains that the job is as a writer of sexy short stories. Novelists are not required, but I suppose `Naughty Short Story Writer' doesn't have the same kind of pleasing alliterative brevity as the film's actual title. You won't be surprised to learn that Darian is a natural when it comes to writing erotica, and as she writes her stories, we see them acted out by the three newbies that I mentioned earlier. These fantasy ladies do not interact with Darian, Jackie and A.J.

`Naughty Novelist' contains Jackie Stevens' hottest scenes so far, in my opinion, so if you're a fan of hers, you'll want to add this DVD to your collection.  Her first scene with A.J. in this movie is particularly delicious. A.J. is very energetic throughout the movie as she maneuvers herself into some uncomfortable, but hot-looking positions. Needless to say, Darian's prose is so arresting that when Jackie and A.J. read it, why, they just can't help themselves: they simply have to take all their clothes off and play with each other.

As soft-core movies go, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. There are lots of scenes of Darian, Jackie and A.J. in the altogether and the naughty scenes are a little stronger for this film than Seduction put into their comedies these days. That said, I found the editing to be much too speedy at times: when you want the camera to linger, there's invariably an edit so that some scenes are paced more frantically  than they need to be. It was also a little disappointing that none of three established stars indulged in any mouth-to-mouth action in this movie although the new actresses do. The sound quality is also poor particularly during the sex scenes when the music soundtrack obscures the actresses' dialogue.

As for the extra features, these consist of three short scenes with Darian Caine. The first sees Darian arrive home after a tough day. She relaxes by removing her clothes and playing with herself. Can't argue with that. The other two scenes are shot on a very cheap looking set and are short lesbian scenes with Darian and two unnamed actresses. Very pleasant, but again, it would have been nice if there could have been a little more information given such as who the other ladies are, when the scenes were filmed and if they were intended for inclusion in a movie that was never completed. Oh well, I suppose we'll never know.",1232755200,3,3683,5.047697368421052
