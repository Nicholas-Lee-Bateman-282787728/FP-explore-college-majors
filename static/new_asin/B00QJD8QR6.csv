6872600,5,B00QJD8QR6,"I thought this was one of the best crime shows TV has to offer. I think it was on A&E a couple shows then it disappeared. I kept looking for it to no avail until it came out from Amazon. I snagged it right up and I'm happy I did. This series had me from the 1st episode to the last. I don't want to say to much about the content, because I hope others will get into this show with it's DVD sales and return to TV for another season. All I will say is, Chloe Sevigny proves AGAIN what a GREAT ACTRESS she is along with her co-stars made this show compelling to say the least. We have to many ""sicko's"" already in this country and I hate to think this show could give food for thought to someone trying to emulate something like this shows plot, but it had my total interest and devotion from beginning to end and I sure hope the show gets renewed. Well written and acted, I think most people would really get into this show if they gave it a shot.",1421452800,25,946,4.01058201058201
6872601,4,B00QJD8QR6,Glad to finally see the conclusion of this series which was treated disrespectfully by its original network. I would watch James D'Arcy and Chloe Sevigney in virtually anything. Highly engrossing.,1436572800,,196,5.566666666666666

6872605,2,B00QJD8QR6,"Sophomoric crime drama has no real psychological terror like True Detective or The Killing.
Instead, its a bland, mainstream procedural with sadistic male killers torturing women without
an interesting plot  behind it, like Criminal Minds.

I always liked Chlo Sevigny as a supporting actress. She has been in some great films and done a great job. But (just my opinion) I don't feel she is strong enough as the lead star of this show, with no suspenseful storylines & lightweight supporting actors. Like James Morrison as the obligatory Chief of Detectives who always disagrees and yells at her for no reason.

Making this DVD set even worse - the manufacturer did not put a chapter mark after the opening credits.

So when the opening music / credits begin, you cant skip ahead to where the show begins. If you do, youll jump ahead 12-15 minutes and miss the first act. Also, you cannot jump over the  ""recap"" at the start of each episode, or again you will jump 15 minutes into the show.  I don't mind using the fast-forward button. But not putting a chapter mark there is very unprofessional.

Every other TV series DVD allows you to jump over the open credits and start the show.
But not this one. Proving the DVD production is as mediocre as the show itself.",1429747200,8,1264,4.666666666666667

6872610,4,B00QJD8QR6,"I liked this show. They moved it from A&E to Lifetime Movie channel, but I watched the whole season. I found out on imdb that it was canceled.

8691598,5,B00QJD8QR6,"Those Who Kill is a ten-episode 2014 American adaptation of the original 2010 Danish murder mystery and thriller series, by the same name. It is comprised of ten episodes, each of which focuses on a separate serial murder mystery. The story line of Those Who Kill centers around an elite unit of homicide detectives within the Pittsburgh Police Department, who are tasked with investigating murder cases that may represent serial killings. This homicide investigation team consists of a supervisory command officer, two veteran detectives, a forensic pathologist, and a behavioral psychologist and researcher. This behavioral psychologist is essentially a profiler, and he methodically formulates a detailed profile of each serial killer based on the available forensic evidence, his insight and intuition, and his substantial previous experience. There are many clever plot twists, which serve to challenge the viewer throughout the course of the series. Those Who Kill is an exceptionally intelligent and intriguing detective procedural series, because it systematically delineates the complex investigative process by which the serial killer is ultimately identified and apprehended. As always, the captivating performance of the lead actor, Chloe Sevigny, is outstanding. The performances of the talented supporting actors, James DArcy, James Morrison, Bruce Davison, Omid Abtahi, and Kerry OMalley, are also stellar. This American version of Those Who Kill is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be just as engaging and entertaining as the original Danish production. Those Who Kill features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1508889600,2,1823,5.780669144981412
8691599,5,B00QJD8QR6,"I'm not a regular TV viewer, and when I do; it's late night and I find myself mostly flipping channels. Somehow, I stumbled upon this series, and did it ever get my attention. Like lots of folks, I love police procedurals. This was just so intense and out there compared to the regular programming. The main characters are both terribly flawed, and I was always worried that one of them would implode. It was great seeing Bruce Davison is still working, and Chloe Sevigny is an amazing actress. I was sooooo sorry to see it go away. I don't know, but this reminds me of European TV series I've seen before. A real shame; maybe it'll be revived someday.",1484611200,,652,4.487394957983193

8691604,5,B00QJD8QR6,"I remember back in the day 15 years or so before hipster was even a word
There's was this slick little basic cable channel called A&E with cool nitch programming & there bio's on celebs
along with re-runs of Homicide: Life on the Street
The fact a cable network understood how amazing Homicide: LOTS was and ran huge blocks of it always made me both amazed & happy
Fast forward to 2010 or so A&E has become this lazy I mean lazy network only focusing on so-called reality shows
For god sakes there number one show is about a bunch of racist hillbillies that made there fortune by ""hunting birds""
Seriously in 2014 american tv viewers are such ""marks"" They will watch any garbage put on tv
while talented writers and actors get blindsided by The reality tv machine
I will give A&E major props for going into production with this
Those That Kill is without a doubt this really impressive basic cable series that you would see on a pay channel (How the rights were not sold to HBO or Showtime is beyond me)
The fact A&E bought the rights and went into production with a show that has no business being on basic cable blows me away
Good for A&E for trying to think out of the box it's so good on so many Levels
Think The Following much darker and edgy on so many levels
It paints a picture of how being a Homicide detective isn't for any cop you have to be a little Damaged to catch killers
The Casting director did a great job!

The Pilot has two breakout performances

Chlo Sevigny was perfectly cast as Catherine Jensen (She is without a doubt the Female Johnny Depp) she will take some of the most off the wall rolls it's Not about a payday it's about perfecting her Acting Craft
Chlo is so awesome and under the radar when it comes to a Mainstream push!

James D'Arcy as Thomas Schaeffer is the other breakout performance
Thomas Schaeffer is much like Catherine Jensen in the sense they both have allot of Layers I'll leave it at that

James Morrison is one of those great characters actors (having him cast helps the Pilot he makes sense as a Homicide Lt. he's voice and overall presence adds high quality to the Pilot

There's lots of small details that add a lot of realism to it
You see people smoke (I'm not a smoker but, a lot of cops & fireman smoke and something about seeing actors on tv smoke adds authenticity!
The story takes you down a deep rabbit hole (when you come back to the top you will very much feel dirty and effected)
It will haunt you in the sense after you watch it... The pilot stays in your head and bounces around for a while
Which Is a good thing not enough forms of media does this
The Quality is on par with any big budget hollywood film

Just hopefully A&E give this show and chance to grow and don't kill it off with a cliff hanger ending (Like they did with a awesome A&E Series Breakout Kings)
Do yourself a favor watch the pilot If you don't get it or it just Creeps you out It's understandable
But, more tv shows need to be like this
It's very much fearless and pulls no punches
One of the strongest Pilots I've seen in a long time The Pilot is Close to Perfect 9.8/10
If the Pilot is any clue where this show can go
The sky is the limit
Keep it up A&E get behind Both Longmire & Those Who Kill Enough of the hacky fake reality

UPDATE 3-19-2014 Just found out that A&E Pulled Those Who Kill from the Monday rotation after Bates Motel....
Really they claim it's lack of Ratings
IMO it's Not that my theory is simple (If you look around Reviewers are just being Huge Smocks Because ""Spoiler Alert"" Chlo Sevigny's character is a Cutter and people are just Blasting the show just for that 'Cause Kids are gonna mimic A Show that's Not even in the teenage Demo
I'm pretty sure A&E is being Bullied by Special Interest Groups and A&E is just taking it across the chin
People Cut, People also smoke, and drink and beat there wife/kids
Shame on you A&E but, yet all the bad press They got with That Farce Duck Dynasty they fought for that piece of Garbage and you can't avoid all the promos for that Dead Duck
Everyone should make noise regarding this show it's so Good and should not get Killed off/Canceled Because A&E is afraid of the ""real"" subject matter",1449532800,,4190,4.309644670050761
8691605,2,B00QJD8QR6,"I found THOSE WHO KILL by accident. As a fan of the British crime drama BROADCHURCH, I went looking for movies and shows featuring actors I liked from BROADCHURCH. James D'Arcy was great in BROADCHURCH and THOSE WHO KILL also stars  Chloe Sevigny. Two good actors in what seemed like another interesting crime drama made THOSE WHO KILL a good choice--or so I thought.
As someone who grew up near Pittsburgh, I was even more interested once I saw the show was set in Pittsburgh. My excitement and interested started to fade immediately.  THOSE WHO KILL is just a big disappointment on all levels.
Sevigny's Catherine Jensen is a young homicide detective who plays by her own rules. She walks through her scenes with no hint of emotion and a callous forced nature that seemed way off track. D'Arcy's Thomas Schaeffer is another emotionless character in this bizarre drama. What is going on here?
THOSE WHO KILL is very similar to the British series WIRE IN THE BLOOD. A female homicide detective is tracking down serial killers with the aid of a forensic psychologist. It's almost comical that these forensic detectives seem to be able to look at a crime scene and determine all the aspects of the killer almost down to what he had for dinner. In THOSE WHO KILL, we have a detective who is emotionally broken and has suspicions that her stepfather (a well-respected judge) may be responsible for the disappearance of her brother.
Unfortunately, everything is wrong about this show. The killings are particularly gruesome and macabre. It gets unnerving at times. There are a few classic views of downtown Pittsburgh that set the location but not much else but neighborhood names identify the city. At least the Pittsburgh police seem fairly competent but again a major flaw comes into place. The show is set in Pittsburgh but not one person has the distinctive Pittsburgh accent. Not a one! British actor D'Arcy can do a perfect generic American accent. I would have loved to have heard him try a Pittsburgh accent.
Even the music was seriously annoying. Nothing seemed right about this series. The main stars seemed bored and stilted in their acting though the lesser actors had some merit. Anne Dudek who pays Benedicte Shaeffer, the long-suffering wife of the psychologist shines in this series. Beautiful and talented.
Now after having written a negative review, I have to admit that I probably would have watched season 2 (if there ever is one) to follow the relationship of Jensen and her stepfather (Bruce Davison) to its final outcome. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this series to anyone. WIRE IN THE BLOOD is much better as are the other countless crime drama series.
It seems like Pittsburgh is the home of a number of gruesome serial killers--Poor Pittsburgh.",1449014400,4,2774,4.887473460721869
8691606,1,B00QJD8QR6,Awful. Very poorly directed. Not even Chlo Sevigny could save it.,1439856000,,65,5.0
