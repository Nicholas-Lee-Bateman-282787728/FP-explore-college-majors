193871,5,1573623903,Excellent movie even though I had a feeling that the great Canadian wilderness had more to do with that than anything else. Narration meanders slowly like the big river that charts the progress of the expedition.

193891,5,1573623903,"The early 1990s saw a number of brilliant movies released centered on Native American history -- Son of the Morning Star, Dances with Wolves, and this, Black Robe, released on the heels of Dances with Wolves and overshadowed by its splashier and more mainstream  Hollywood cousin.  Black Robe might be seen as the Eastern, pre-United States counterpart to DWW in its similar  theme of the clash of cultures and how a white civilization-based worldview might be altered through contact with the indigenous culture encountered by its representatives.  This movie is more nuanced and subtle, however, and is suffused with a sadness and tragic quality that is true to history while not sacrificing heroism, nobility, and emotional involvement.

The script, based on the novel, is brought to life superbly and the Canadian locations lend authenticity to this story of early Jesuit missionaries in what was then New France -- how the priests (""Black Robes"") changed Indian society and were in turn changed.  Father LaForgue is an isolated figure in a strange, new world full of menace and unknown challenges.  His Huron companions regard him as an inscrutable, possibly dangerous outsider.  And both move in fear of their mutual enemies, the Iroquois.  The tale of Father LaForgue's journey from the fringes of French settlement into the heart of Indian territory is a quest of sorts, one that presents constant peril. At the end lies the possibility of redemption -- but at a price.  And for the Indians, their world is changed forever, one way or another.

There are no stock characters here -- the priests are neither saints nor rabid fanatics, the Indians are neither noble savages nor demonic villains (altho' the Iroquois,  hereditary enemies of the Hurons as they are,  come close to the latter).  People are portrayed realistically, as a mix of good and bad, motivated in turn by faith, fear, lust, greed, or selflessness.  A carefully crafted film  with  excellent performances,  graceful direction, and a lyrical, evocative score by the great  Georges Delerue (one of his last soundtracks).  Five stars!

193919,5,1573623903,"This is a grimly realistic film about the colonisation of New France in the 17th century. A Jesuit missionary sets out into the forest wilderness of Canada along with some Algonquins to go to the Huron Mission up river under instruction from his superior, in order to reach a remote mission where native Americans have killed the previous priests. The mission is to save souls but conventional European wisdom seems inadequate to change the spirit of the land and its people. The party travels through a rough but very beautiful scenery and the inevitable meeting with Iroquois results in near disaster. The priest who while travelling explores the extremes of barbarity and beauty, betrayal and loyalty, is transformed and prevails not by words or dogma but by self-sacrifice. The film is meticulously researched presenting authenticity in everything from weapons, customs, to native dialects. The strangeness of the two sides is amply covered when each groups comments on the other. Especially the scene where the priest demonstrated to some natives what reading and writing can achieve to their utter astonishment, was really fantastic in simplicity and truth.",1441584000,3,1163,5.258064516129032

193935,2,1573623903,"Black Robe is a movie that tries to focus on a real cultural-conflict that happened and still happens in North America. But instead of showing the different intercultural problems from different ankles and perspectives it wastes the time on showing Canadian landscapes and working with stereotypes: The simple minded native who fully trusts on his dreams and just follow its deeper instincts which includes not much more that power, influence, violence and sex, on the one side. And the educated, morally-intact French Christian. Sure there are a also a lot of good scenes showing the deeper conflict between the two cultures but most of the time the film scratches on the surface of this subject.

Black Robe is a good try on an important topic but it fails at the really important points in this conflict.

193990,5,1573623903,"Black Robe is one of best movies I've seen.  As a longtime student of the European/Native American contact and collision, I am always eager to see new manifestations of it on screen.  Black Robe is unique in the way it portrays the utter incomprehension of the two groups, even when both attempt to do right by the other.  I repeatedly sensed that this movie got it right, scene after scene.  The fact that it was set in the seventeenth century in what would become Canada is perfect.  Everything is new, yet to be tried, rife with the opportunity for adventure.  The Jesuits, Rome's shock troops, are there to bring the souls of the natives to God, as they see God, and as they want God to be seen by the native people, and this blinds Father LaForge UTTERLY to the real way in which he might have been of help to the native people, the real way in which he might have reached their souls.  His clumsy efforts are but a metaphor for desires of European peoples to spread the word of Christianity among the ""benighted"" of the earth, none of whom expresses much interest in his teaching.  They have been doing well enough with their own conceptions of the hereafter, it appears, and obviously don't grasp the full intent of his presence among them.  The fact that the imposition of Christianity on the natives ultimately leads to their destruction at the hands of their enemies (the final scenes) ends the movie with  powerful questions regarding a whole range of moral issues, relevant at the time and in our time.  It should also be pointed out that the use of NATURE and WEATHER were incomparable here.  The huge distances, the cold, the snow, the unforgiving quality of the forest and the river contribute enormously to the message of the movie.",1417305600,3,1748,4.603225806451613

194024,3,1573623903,"I read a review of this movie from  Arch Notes newsletter published by the Ontario Archeological Society Inc. , at http://www.wyandot.org/blkrob.htm

This film felt very wrong to me, so many negative stereotypes of Native American peoples, I agreed with the author of the above mentioned article that "" Even members of the Mafia are presented with more sympathy and understanding in the movies. We see the Iroquois torture without reason, kill a child from sheer savagery, and do what appears a small thing in a non-native context, but would have been a big thing to the 17th century Iroquois. They have their prisoners sing a death song - true to the culture. However the singing prisoners were laughed at, very unlikely, as a death song tended to be respected. Those who sang such a song were deemed brave for their being able to sing when a weaker person would have cried out. The singing prisoners would have been respected for their bravery, part of a code of honor the movie did not show. Sure the Iroquois were sometimes violent; they were sometimes silly, peaceful, reasonable and honorable.

In traditional Huron belief the raven was a visionary messenger; in Black Robe: it creates blindness. The difference between this movie and a balanced accurate portrayal of Canadian history is a difference between ravens. ""

I was very surprised to see a current day movie give such a prejudiced and untrue depiction of Native American culture etc.....and there seemed no emphasis on the sickness that the 'white' man brought-nor on his stealing everything from the people who they came to 'save'.......",1404432000,,1604,4.973880597014926

I have read their few letters to Rome from their field from this world, only tears and joy that I feel!
This movie is for Oscar's best movie but i know why they will NOT because it is some what a religious movie: so sad! Just watch the movie- it's great hard work and true to reality!

Unlike other films where the White guy goes native and fights other white guys, then rides off into the sunset with his native beauty, this sensitive, classic film illustrates what early contacts between Europeans and Northern Indigenous Peoples (i.e. Mohaawks, Hurons, etc) would have really been like, and how each side saw the other as barbaric and savage.

194129,5,1573623903,"Although slightly fictional, ""Blackrobe"" tells the tale of a young French priest sent out to parlay with the Iroquois in La Nouvelle France.  ""Blackrobe"" captures the feel and nuances of French Canada perfectly, although viewers unfamiliar with relations between the Europeans and First Peoples may feel a bit lost.  Father Laforgue comes to Quebec to be sent out along with a small party of voyageurs and Hurons to act as interpreters to try and convert members of that clan.  But trouble lurks beneath the surface as the Huron distrust Father Laforgue and his French compatriot especially on account of cultural differences between the two groups.  Without giving away too much of the plot, a series of events lead Father Laforgue mission awry and soon all are fighting for, and in some cases, losing their lives.  By the end Father Laforgue is confronted with a dire situation; one which requires both compassion and forgiveness beyond what you can imagine.

 ""Blackrobe"" has been praised by a number of historians for its accuracy in look, character, and feel for that era.  There certainly are precious few good movies that touch on this era and aspect of the colonial era of Canadian history that doesn't devolve into inaccurate clichs and outright fabrication, yet ""Blackrobe"" deftly avoids those pitfalls.  There is a fair amount of violence and sexual content that is not gratuitous and helps to advance the plot, however it does make it unsuitable for use in educational situations.  Some of the richness of the film may escape non-historians but it is thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.",1356393600,,1596,5.080459770114943

194163,5,1573623903,"Released in 1991 and based on Brian Moore's researched novel, ""Black Robe"" relays the story of a young Jesuit priest in 1634 visiting the French settlement that later became Quebec City. Father LaForgue is assigned to a distant Huron mission accompanied by a young quasi-believing assistant and a family of Algonquin Indians. The group faces challenges beyond the harsh realities of the river trek itself, including an attack by hostile Iroquois. Of course the Indians question the ""strange ways"" of the priest and his dark attire and wonder whether he is a demon. Instead of addressing him as ""Father"" they simply call him ""Black Robe.""

I've viewed ""Black Robe"" three times now and it never fails to capture my attention from beginning to end (the film runs 101 minutes), which is why I don't get the criticism that it's somehow unabsorbing. What strikes me most is the raw realism. Viewing ""Black Robe"" is the next best thing to going back in time and viewing the events firsthand.

Other highlights include: Lothaire Bluteau's solid performance as the missionary priest; LaForgue's assistant, well played by Aden Young, and his developing love for the daughter of the Algonquin leader, played by the beautiful Sandrine Holt; the Algonquins themselves, particular the patriarch; the freaky midget shaman of a band of Montagnais natives; the harrowing events at an Iroquois fort; the subtext on the truth or falsity of spiritual beliefs, both of the Jesuits and the Indians; and the spectacular cinematography of the Quebec wilderness (mostly the Saint Lawrence River, filmed on location). The film successfully shows the desolate, untamed nature of the NE before the mass encroachment of Europeans.

Some may wonder: How does it compare to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-of-the-Mohicans/dp/B001L62REY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last of the Mohicans</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-With-Wolves-20th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B004AOECXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances With Wolves (20th Anniversary Edition)</a>,"" two contemporary films also featuring realistic portrayals of AmerIndians? Of the two, ""Black Robe"" is closer to ""Last of the Mohicans"" since the story takes place in the East and there aren't any cowboys & Indians, although the story takes place well over a century earlier. The film differs from both in that there aren't really any Hollywood contrivances, including conventional movie plotting. As great and generally believable as those other films are, ""Black Robe"" shows the harsher, bleaker reality, which some may translate as boring.

However, as raw and realistic as ""Black Robe"" is, it could've been more so, considering that it fails to show one disturbing reality of Eastern AmerIndian culture, as detailed in Moore's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Robe-A-Novel/dp/0452278651/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Robe: A Novel</a>&nbsp;(pointed out by another reviewer): The film avoids depicting the native practice of ritual cannibalism on a dead infant, a custom that was common among the tribes of the Eastern woodlands. To consume an enemy's flesh was to absorb his power. The heart of an especially courageous foe (such as Jesuit martyr St. Jean Brebeuf) would be eaten by tribal leaders. But, don't get me wrong here, I'm kind of glad the movie left this aspect out.

""Black Robe"" has the same vibe as 2007's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mongol-The-Rise-of-Genghis-Khan/dp/B001F34HT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan</a>,"" so if you appreciate that style of raw-realism you'll likely value ""Black Robe."" Needless to say, if you have ADHD or require constant explosions to maintain your attention, stay far away.

194166,5,1573623903,"If Bruce Beresford's `Driving Miss Daisy' suffered from a softened, Hollywooden view of history and racial conflicts,
the bleak, beautiful sometimes horrific, always uncompromising `Black Robe' is its correlative opposite.

Set in the 17th century, both the Native Canadian people, and the French Jesuits who come to bring then religion
(when they already have their own, thank you very much) are presented as deeply flawed, cold and cruel at times,
blind to the complexities of each other's humanity.

Yet both are also touched by moments of kindness and understanding that lead to the sense that this story of one
Jesuit's torturous trip with a band of native guides is not without it's growth for all involved.

Most critics were mixed on this, and I understand their objections, though I don't share them.  The film is distant
emotionally, and we never really get inside any of the characters, even the titular priest, called `Black Robe' by the
native people.  The film is more illustrative than dramatic.  Again, the exact opposite strengths and weaknesses of
Beresord's `Driving Miss Daisy', which was full of wonderfully moving characters, but lacking honest context.

They knew it was very important.  It's too bad the movie portrayed a missionary so poorly.  Apparently, I should of read a little more about movie before purchasing it.  I won't be watching it again.

It is the perfect movie to write a paper about for those in college. Not only is the story compelling and the scenes tense, but the scenery in the movie (Quebec) is absolutely breathtaking. This movie has a little bit of everything; it has a number of cultures (Indian tribes and French) who violently clash and blood is shed. In a nutshell, the movie is about Jesuit Missionaries who are trying to convert local Algonquin Indians to Christianity, which is met with stern opposition and accusations of the Jesuit priest (Black Robe) being a demon. The Indian cultures have a different values system than the Frenchmen; they are indulgent in the many pleasures of life while the Frenchmen on the mission advocate a life of discipline and sacrifice in order to have a promising afterlife. Black Robe doesn't condone the Indian way of life, and goes as far as belittling them. Later on, Black Robe gets lost in the forest, and fear overcomes him. In the end, Black Robe goes from a God-fearing man to someone who is now questioning his own place in the world. This movie is about self-reflection, and the tense climate along the way allows for character development. This movie was well-done in terms of production, actors, and environment. A triumph.

The premise is interesting and moves at a great pace. The year is 1634 and the place is a French settlement that will become New Quebec. The Jesuit missionaries are trying to convince Algonquin Indians to become Christians. A Jesuit priest goes a journey through the wilderness in an effort to help convert the Algonquins. He will face many challenges along the way. The story is intended to make you think about different belief systems in the past, present, and future.

What was life like in the 17th century for a missionary in Canada? This movie tries to show life among the Noble Savages for a Jesuit missionary, who wore a black robe. Father LaForgue travels among the Hurons to try to convert them to Christianity from their pagan beliefs. Can he bring an end to the continuous tribal warfare? Much of this film is in a foreign language with subtitles in English.

While traveling the Black Robe and the friendly Indians are captured by an enemy tribe. They plan to torture these captives to death. Burning at the stake was one method, the other was roasting them alive over an open fire. Neither was shown in this movie since the captives were able to escape into the frozen wilderness. ""You're not so stupid, Black Robe.""

The escapees arrive at a Huron village, but it is deserted. The villagers have fled because of a disease (""fever"") that came upon them. [Note the embedded stakes around the village to protect them from a surprise attack. The missionaries hope the Hurons will accept Baptism as a cure for their disease. The Hurons do not want to give up their traditions of constant warfare and polygamy. The fear of disease changed their minds.

Fifteen years later, after the Hurons converted to Christianity, they were attacked by the Iroquois, their traditional enemies, and abandoned this village. The mission was closed, the Jesuits returned to Quebec. But they succeeded in the long run.",1303344000,3,1460,4.804780876494024

Those ""things"" rather can be simply inferred by a minimal application of reason and common sense. As far as the ""faith"" of the Jesuit priest in the film, it is at best a laughable caricature of the true heroics, sanctity, and wisdom of the Jesuit missionaries who IN REALITY manned the mission territories.

194199,4,1573623903,"This is an excellent film about the history of our giant neighbor to the North, Canada. It is also a look at what happens when European and native cultures intersect, with much misunderstanding on both sides. Thus it is of interest as a history or anthropology film, but it also tells a very interesting story.  The film tells the story of a 17th century French Jesuit missionary who is sent to the Canadian wilds to a remote Huron mission. He is accompanied and lead by a group of Algonquin natives who are very ambivalent about the white explorers, trappers, and priests.  As the journey up the St. Lawrence River progresses, the priest is put to many tests of his faith. He is accompanied by a young French explorer who also begins to question the Euro-centric world view of his people as he comes to know the Algonquin culture, spiritual beliefs, and as he falls in love with an Algonquin woman. This sensuous love affair challenges the parents of the Algonquin woman for they have many prejudices about the intelligence and intent of white men. It also challenges the Jesuit priest since it stimulates suppressed sexual desires. The priest is contrasted with his young European partner who is more open to the influence of the native peoples and is not focused on interpretation of life experiences primarily through Roman Catholicism. A primary strength of the film is the excellent characterization of the native Canadian characters which reveals them to be fully human with fully human assets and faults. There are very frightening and violent scenes when the Algonquians and the two Europeans encounter an Iroquois war party and are taken prisoners. Beside the Algonquians and Iroquois, the Huron are also part of this story of culture meets culture, faith meets faith. The balance and judgment in the script and acting is welcomed. Lothaire Blutheau is excellent as the priest, a man who is transformed by his journey and yet retains the central core element of his faith. Aden Young is his handsome apprentice who gradually becomes integrated into the native culture as their journey continues. Sandrine Holt is excellent as the native young woman who loves and is loved by the young Frenchman. August Schellenberg is also excellent as her father and the chief, a wise man with wide experience who also changes as he encounters both European and Christian cultural values.  However, the beautiful and dramatic landscape of Canada is also a star in this film which reveals to us what this natural wonder was like 4 centuries ago.",1257984000,7,2539,4.913752913752914

194216,4,1573623903,"The stark landscape and attendant violence might make this seem real for it's time, but the Indian characters are the same stereotypes we always see coming from Hollywood. It is the portrayal of a missionary that makes this a different film. Nice scenery even in a film which is not well digitized for today's high definition. You will need a warm blanket while watching canoes moving through so much ice and snow. This movie reveals human cruelty in a harsh landscape. It is set among  incidents of violence between groups of Huron and Iroquois peoples during the early contact with Europeans. The film's dozens of Native characters are lightly to moderately developed in contrast to the main character a Jesuit missionary. While he is the main character he is portrayed with a cold aloofness which is fitting his personality, historical role and the landscape setting. Directed and framed with a touch of abstraction it is the horror which makes this story human not some warm fuzzies. The Jesuit Black Robe is sent among North Eastern tribes as a human sacrifice by his superiors. This is a self fulfilling prophesy  revealed through revelations, past and present of his self loathing and in flashbacks of his mother's prophesy. Black Robe is a psychologically dark film which floats the usual raft of Indian stereotypes to a deeper more graphic contemporary stomach turning level. However murderous or sexually unashamed the Natives seem they are bluntly, satisfyingly human in contrast to the starch collared priest who has forever lived in mental torture but never had a minute of pleasure in his life. Or perhaps he has, we can only guess, when we see him beating Mia Culpa's on his back with tree branches following his voyeuristic sexual incident in the woods. Finally arriving at the abandoned mission where he is assigned he immediately gathers an Indian following by telling one less lie than his recently deceased priestly predecessor. Truth being such a rare thing to them we know Indians flock to any white man who shows the slightest improvement regarding the forked tongue issue and he instantly sets about baptizing them all. Should we mention he is greatly helped in this conversion by children who are dying enmasse from fever. The strength of this film lies in looking more deeply into the  mind of a Jesuit missionary and his culture at the time of contact. Recent American history scholars might suggest these fellows were misguided but well intended messengers who brought disease, intertribal warfare and sexual perversion to a people that probably had few struggles in these areas- but after all the Indian probably did deserved it for his violent nature, brought about by ignorance and weakness. Black Robe is not a departure from that formula. Since Hollywood has shifted little in the Indian/White Man Western genera than to add a more sympathetic eye to the Indian side of things, it is interesting to see a film which centers on the missionary mind.",1233446400,5,2980,4.979919678714859
194217,5,1573623903,"Wow, what a fascinating movie and different kind of film  It's just beautiful, too, and one those films you hope comes out on Blu-Ray to really show off the cinematography.

Black Robe has the same kind of beautiful and haunting images Terrence Malick's films possess but the director in this case is Bruce Bereford, the man who directed ""Driving Miss Daisy"" a couple of years before doing this film. ""Daisy"" also is beautifully-filmed.

Black Robe is not just a piece of art. As great as it is visually, this is a powerful story of a well-intentioned Jesuit priest in the early 17th century who travels to ""New France"" (upstate New York/French Canadian territory) attempting to convert a few area tribes to Christianity. To unbelievers, that seems pushy but Biblically-speaking it is not. Jesus commanded his followers to do just that (Matt. 28:18-20) , so the priest is only doing what missionaries have done for centuries. He also is a good man, stays strong in his beliefs regardless of his own well-being and is a gentle soul. Kudos to the filmmakers for being fair to him.

The Algonquins and the Hurons are also shown with their beliefs, too, and their cultures which obviously were in contrast to the white European-based priest. All sides are shown fairly in this movie, with both positive and negative traits of all.

I was shocked at a few scenes in here, not expecting them as the film has such a gentle flow to it before anything dramatic happens. We see a few sexual scenes and then some brutal violence. The Hurons, particularly, do not want any invasion of their privacy and culture and are openly hostile to the priest and the Algonquins. The story transforms from a quiet Malick-type ""New World"" poetic piece to a violent, suspenseful film and the question is, will the ""good guys"" make it out alive?

The actors in here, perhaps, are not names most people outside Canada are familiar with, including me, but Lothaire Blueteau as Father Laforgue, Aden Young as his assistant ""Daniel"" and Sandrine Holt as Daniel's Algonguin lover ""Anuuka"" are all very, very good. All the characters in this film are very credible people, steadfast in their own beliefs and they come across as realistic people. Most films have unreal people with unrealistic dialog....but not in this movie.

Another big plus was the soundtrack: a lush, haunting score throughout.

194244,5,1573623903,"This visually stunning and ultimately heartbreaking film by Bruce Beresford became something of a rental cult classic after it disappeared from theaters.  Based on Brian Moore's fine novel of the same name (which I also read), the film's central character is young Father Laforgue, an idealistic French Jesuit priest who is determined to bring the light of salvation to the savages, i.e., the Algonquin, Mohawk, and Huron nations who inhabit ""New France"" in the Canadian frontier in the mid-17th century.  The title of the film refers to the name the Indians have given to the French priests because of their long black habits.

Fr. Laforgue is given a mission at the start of the film: to travel 1,500 miles north by river to the Jesuit mission in Huron territory, to assist the aging priest who can no longer function on his own there.  Fr. Laforgue's long journey by canoe, guided by a band of Algonquin who have agreed to take him to Huron country for a heap of trade goods, is doubly perilous as it begins just as winter is setting in.  The journey north comprises most of the film, and for all concerned becomes one of evolution of the mind and soul as well as bodily hardship, as Fr. Laforgue and his Algonquin companions get to know each other and begin to question the assumptions that each has made of the other's culture.

The cinematography is breathtaking, and as the film was shot on location in Canada during mid-winter, the actors involved have referred to this shoot as one of the most painful and difficult in their experience.  The cast is wonderful, with special mention to Lothaire Bluteau as Fr. Laforgue and August Schellenberg as Chomina, the Algonquin chief.  Composer Georges Delrue produced a beautiful score for the film, which enhances but never intrudes upon it (Delrue also did the striking score for ""Anne of a Thousand Days"").  The rest of the cast is also exceptional, with Aden Young giving a nicely restrained performance of the young Frenchman who accompanies Fr. Laforgue, but during the journey slowly goes ""native under the skin"", as it is sometimes put.

The film is sad and at times quite disturbing, exploring the cruelty, both unintended and deliberate, that humans inflict upon each other in the name of cultural bonding and beliefs.  The condescension of white Europeans toward Native cultures is not spared, but neither is the ritual cruelty inflicted by Indians of different tribal affiliations on each other.  Fr. Laforgue and his companions are ambushed and captured by a band of Mohawks on the way northward and are tortured and humiliated by them, barely escaping via the seduction of the Mohawk guard by Chomina's beautiful young daughter.  In fact, there was some outcry in the Native community when the film came out because the Mohawks are shown only as brutal torturers without any other social context.  However, as Chomina grimly points out to Fr. Laforgue, when he protests that these Mohawks are nothing like Chomina and his family, ""We would have done the same thing.""  More than anything else, ""Black Robe"" is an indictment of assumptions of cultural and spiritual superiority - a trait shared in the film by both the Natives and the Europeans.

The film's ending presages the catastrophe for Native peoples that European emigration to and conquest of North America will bring about in another 150 years.  However, on an individual note, it is a tender and evolved ending.  By the end of his journey, Fr. Laforgue questions whether acceptance of baptism without understanding its meaning represents a true salvation.  When a man among the crowd of Hurons asks Fr. Laforgue if he loves them, Fr. Laforgue looks out at them and sees not a group of savage souls to add to the Christian heaven, but indivdual human beings.  ""Yes,"" he whispers, his eyes filling with tears, ""I love you.""

This is a very affecting film and a far superior entry into the European/Native ""culture clash"" genre than films such as Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" and Michael Mann's ""Last of the Mohicans"".  I don't say that these films did not work on their own terms or that they did not at least try to repair decades of the film industry's insensitive portrayals of indigenous peoples, but those films were made and intended for the action/adventure market and show it.

""Black Robe"" is a vastly more complex and adult - and less comfortable - exploration of the ""culture clash"" theme, and its emotional impact lingers in the mind and heart long after the credits fade.",1200441600,17,4514,4.871895424836601
194245,5,1573623903,"This is the most realistic depiction of Native Americans I have seen in the wide screen. The movie sets in the year 1634, roughly 20 years after the founding of Quebec and 14 years after the landing of the Mayflower.  Samuel de Champlain is still the governor of the precariously held French settlement.

Historical background: Champlain had earlier accompanied a party of Huron and/or Abenaki in an incursion south, along the shores of the lake he named after himself. They came across a party of Iroquois near today's Ticonderoga and, in the ensuing battle, Champlain shot the leader of the Iroquois party, thus deciding the encounter. The Iroquois never forgot and from that moment on they became rivals of both the French and the northern Indians.

The movie: It is in that context that the Jesuits decide to send another priest to the Huron Mission, upstream the Saint Lawrence, along the shores of Lac Frontenac (now lake Ontario).

The savage beauty of the landscapes is breathtaking. The cruelty of the Canadian winter is powerfully conveyed in all its splendor. The movie makes a very successful effort to portray the Native Americans as they were: bound by their own set of rules, fears, and beliefs, totally alien to Europeans but not so to the young French-Canadian. The end of the movie (which I will not describe here) was a direct consequence of M. Champlain shot at Ticonderoga.

Long treks up and down rivers and over mountainous terrain and dense forest with little dialogue is not compelling enough for me to rate this film higher than 2 stars. Historically, it is not accurate in regards to the tribal customs of the Iroquois people.
Lothaire Bluteau as ""Black Robe"" is a far more effective actor when left to speak French in his other film credits. He seems unsettled and unemotional in his English speaking roles. Bluteau is far more effective in JESUS de MONTREAL.

194249,5,1573623903,"I was captivated by this film from the moment I saw it. I remember it came out around the mid 90's, not long after Kevin Costner's Epic 'Dances With Wolves' made its Hollywood impact. Yet to my mind Bruce Beresford's depiction of the French Jesuit Priests on a mission in New France in the 17th century to save the so called 'savages' or natives from 'outer darkness', had an honesty that was both far more movingly beautiful even if brutally cruel. Why do I love this film so much? Let me count the ways. Well it's such a balanced and intelligent exploration of a complex subject. It presents no real right or wrong, no black or white, moral preachiness, or good guy/bad guy mentality. It paints a well researched and respectful picture of the Native American culture, steering away from demeaning stereotypes and hollywood predictability.

Spiritualality and its cultural separations, are definitely a central theme in this film, and I just love the way Beresford treats both subjects and cultures with empathy and dignity. Father La Forgue however, seems the more forlorn and tragic figure here, out of his element amidst the icy, harsh Canadian landscape where nature shows no mercy. Deluded somewhat in his quest to save a race and culture, who perhaps ultimately, have just as much to teach the white man in terms of honour, bravery, respect for the laws of nature and avoidance of greed and ego. The cinematography, musical score and imagery are memorably beautiful. Particularly the references to the importance of dreams, and 'The waking world perhaps being an illusion'. The film also questions the hypocracy and interpretation of religion in a sense. Specifically, where 'Daniel'(Aiden Young), Father La Forgue's faithful assistant (torn between his devotion to his faith and love/lust for an Algonquian maiden 'Annuka'), makes the point."" But they are true Christians Father, they live for each other, they forgive things we would never forgive"".

There are some impressive performances here. French Canadian, 'Lothaire Bluteau', of previous 'Jesus of Montreal' fame, is well cast as the young idealistic Jesuit Priest, Father La Forgue. He brings a suitable aura of gentle religious reverence to the role. But I particularly love the character of Chomina (August Schellenburg?). Who I think so perfectly represents the strong, noble and honourable Indian, coupled with a touching fragility and humanity that adds complexity to his character.  An impressive film that provokes many thoughts and questions, it leaves the audience to make its own view point without force feeding them.

To ignore the incarnationality of Jesus within each one of us is to deny the great gospel message of Christianity.  This film shows how a mission without regard for culture can result in devastation beyond all imagination.  I highly recommend this film.",1170720000,8,582,4.666666666666667
194251,5,1573623903,"Black Robe is a lush, incredibly deep, strikingly emotive motion picture, that tells the story of a young Jesuit priest's journey across the dense wilderness of seventeenth-century Quebec, undertaken while he simultaneously experiences a transformative test of his commitment to the stark way of life he has chosen. Which holds the greatest desire for him, a beckoning existence of ease and comfort amid relatives back in France; the possibility of earthly love; or service to God, that almost certainly includes a violent martyrdom?

Guided by his nation's Algonquin allies, the determined, idealistic young man of a privileged caste seeks to take up his assignment at a mission on the edge of ""New France's""  colonial frontier. As this decidedly quiet and cerebral epic unfolds, a journey of spiritual evolution takes this priest and his small band through numerous personal tests and into the face of many dangers, not merely from the unwelcoming savagery of the landscape itself, but from hostile aboriginals who welcome neither the Algonquians nor the European intruder into their homeland. What begins amid the opulence of Bourbon France becomes bluntly visceral with unsparing depictions of torture, bloodlust, rape, and death, and yet the way in which this tale is left to carry itself toward its most unforeseen climax is absolutely courageous.

There are too many noteworthy performances to list here, and any written description of the scenery within this film would fall flat. With its countless tiny moments that contrast cultures (Algonquians thinking the Frenchmen's' mechanical clock was somehow their king, since they lived by its motions) for the alternating bravery, sadism,  devotions and loyalty of those characters within it, for its terrific story, and for its end to end flawless quality, I truly think Black Robe is among the greatest films shot in the 1990's, and might just be at the top of its particular genre.",1169683200,25,1939,5.26537216828479

194294,4,1573623903,"This movie seems to aim at being a serious historical comment and an action-adventure movie.  It is hard to achieve both aims in the same movie.  Life has never been cram-packed with action and adventure even for Jesuit missionaries.  Nevertheless, the movie may have the value of interesting some viewers in the historical subject of New France, which had a long life of about a century and a half but can be seen as one of history's big might-have-beens nevertheless.

The music is beautiful, and so is the scenery.  Captions are provided for the natives as they speak their own languages.  Everything said in English, however, we are supposed to imagine spoken in French, I assume.  Why the French should not speak French, I do not know.  The DVD provides French and Spanish captions, but not voice-overs.

The movie is rated R, probably for sex and violence.  I counted three brief sex scenes.  Whether the first two are dramatically justifiable depends mostly on the audience.  We take in both scenes through the eyes of the missionary, and both communicate something offensive, and this seems to be their point.  In the first, standards of privacy are at stake.  In the second, standards of commitment, as it turns out.  (Much gets said about the sacrament of baptism in this movie; notably little, in view of the plot, about the sacrament of matrimony.)  The third is Hollywoodesque and unlikely to say the least.  The movie is fiction, nowhere more than in that scene.  But as for the violence, the movie is loosely based on a past reality; and the violence is, if anything, toned down from the historically documented violence and cruelty of that time, place, and people.  This does not mean that it is easy to view or that everybody wants to see it.  For first-hand historical accounts, see the Jesuit Relations, available on Amazon.

One theme of the movie is that we are all religious creatures in the sense that awareness of our mortality calls forth a response of some kind.  The Catholic faith was the response of French Catholics and the response taught by the missionaries.  The natives had their own accustomed response.  But are all responses equally good and truthful?  The movie could seem to say so, but the Catholic answer, both then and now, is a firm no.  The movie does not have to be interpretted as affirming religious neutrality or agnosticism, but such an interpretation is easily possible.

One scene shows a penitential gesture on the part of the missionary.  It is possible to view this sympathetically, but I fear that it makes him look like a nut, since it hard to see how he can blame himself at that point.  Penitential practices were not uncommon and could go rather far, but I know of no good reason to think that Catholic missionaries were neurotic.

In another scene, the young Frenchman Daniel tells the missionary about the Algonquin concept of afterlife.  The missionary calls it ""childish.""  Daniel asks rhetorically whether it is harder to believe than that of sitting on clouds enjoying a beatific vision.  End of conversation, in the movie.  Daniel gets the last word on the subject, and it seems anti-Christian.  But in fact, it is merely anti-Dante; and, even at that, Dante's poem and similar works of the European Christian imagination -- the best of them -- would have been poorly summarized or understood.  Obviously, the Catholic Church did not prohibit such works, but also teaches, ""Heaven is the end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, definitive happiness."" (Catechism of the Catholic Church, article 1024).  If sitting on clouds would just bore Daniel, then it would not be heaven for him.

Another theme has to do with dreams, whether happy dreams or nightmares.  See article 67 in the Catechism of the Catholic Church for a statement on private revelations, which says of them, in part, ""It is not their role to improve or complete Christ's definitive Revelation.""  Chomina's dream does reveal a piece of the future, as it turns out, and such dreams do not occur only in fiction, but generally they are, properly, little more than curiosities.  By themselves dreams usually do not reliably guide the dreamer, after waking.  The obstacle of interpreting a dream is usually insurmountable, and bad interpretation makes for bad guidance.  The missionary's remark about people who think that dreams are real and this world is an illusion has everything to do with the Christian faith, for it is terribly important that Jesus lived in this world for real, not in dreams or in movies -- those dreams enabled through Thomas Edison -- and that he rose from the dead for real.  See 1 Corinthians 15: 12-19 for St. Paul's statement on the importance of Jesus's resurrection as real. The missionary would have realized that he was awake in the same real world as Jesus, just sixteeen hundred years later.  The year was 1634.

The movie shows three Huron elders debating whether their tribe should accept Christianity from the Jesuit missionaries.  They think that doing so might weaken their ability to defend themselves militarily.  Then a note at the end of the movie says that the Huron were later ""routed and killed by their Iroquois enemies.""  Without knowing more, the audience would thus be led to believe that the misgivings of the Huron elders were well founded, as though the missionaries had been too pacifistic; but this belief can be doubted.  Historically, the missionaries opposed the common practice of torturing defenseless captives, but did not oppose effective defence.  In fact, they would have reason to defend their own work with arms if necessary.

Some details in this movie dramatize historical conditions of some note.  For example, the very brief scene of Daniel fumbling with his firearm, such as it is, is surely a comment on those extremely awkward and unreliable weapons; the bow was still far superior.  The missionary's comment about brandy in the first scene is a comment on the practice of plying the natives with an addictive substance that their culture had no long experience with.  The costumes and sets are, I assume, facsimiles of the real thing.

Viewers who do not already know might like to be told that one line in the movie, ""For the greater glory of God,"" is, or used to be, the motto of the Jesuits, the Society of Jesus: ""Ad majorem Dei gloriam.""

Another line, a sweeping comment on European history, made by an older priest in France, says that the English and the Germans were uncivilized until ""we"" took our faith to them.  If ""we"" means the Church, then the comment is right as a summary.  If it means the French, then it is not quite right.  The Chrisitanization of the English was undertaken by missionaries from Ireland and from the continent, not all of whom came from Gaul.  The most renowned mission to the Germans was that of St. Boniface, an Englishman.  But all of that pertains to late antiquity or the early middle ages, and the priest's line in the movie could actually have reflected views of Frenchmen by the early 1600s, whose grasp of European history might have been strongly influenced, and distorted, by the more recent part of it.

Joan of Arc is called ""St. Joan.""  Her sainthood would have been, I suppose, accepted in an informal sense in France in the early 1600's.  But she was not actually canonized a saint in the Catholic Church until the 1920s.  Quite a few canonized Catholic saints were in serious trouble with the Church during their lifetimes, but Joan is the only one that I know of who was actually put to death by the Church, to the especially horrible death of being burned alive.  It was the Church under the control of her English enemies, but it was still the official Catholic Church.  That was long before Luther.",1157500800,10,7793,4.826546003016591
194295,3,1573623903,"After reading the reviews about this movie, I had great expectations from it.  The story is quite good, about a missionary Jesuit putting his life on the line for his convictions.  Unfortunately, the priest is confused about his beliefs, and even shaken. At first he is determined to prove himself right, but later is confused. Secondly, this movie has a few explicitly sexual scenes, and frontal nudity.  Not the kind of scenes you would expect in a movie about a priest.  Compare this to the movie The Mission, about Jesuit missionaries in south america.",1155945600,4,556,4.882978723404255
194296,5,1573623903,"Black Robe is a very intriguing story about missionaries back in the early 1600s who are seeking to ""civilize and tame"" the native Americans. The incoming groups are settling in eastern Canada, and a missionary - called ""black robe"" by the Algonquin - wants to go up to Quebec to help with conversions there. He needs a group of Algonquin to help him make that trek, as winter is about to hit. A local young man - one who can speak Algonquin and is looking for adventure - comes along as well.

As tends to happen in these movies, the guy falls in love with the chief's beautiful daughter, and the two civilizations slowly learn about each other. Black robe wows the Algonquin with the concept of writing, and the Algonquin teach black robe something about the meaning of sharing.

There are many interesting scenes involving Algonquin language, singing, dancing and the lovely outfits. There was a lot of effort put forth to make those things accurate. While some of the plot seems predictable, I found I could let that slide.

It's nice that there are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" here. The missionary truly wants to help save the souls of the natives, and he's not taking the easy road out. He could have gone for a cushy life - and he's chosen to head into the frigid lands of a Canadian winter. He's hoping to bring peace and comfort to a group that is constantly at war.

The natives are pretty grey as well. They distrust the newcomers - but they are taking in the cooking gear, tobacco and other supplies. They agree to take black robe up to Quebec in return for supplies - but once they get the supplies (and extra tobacco as well) they take off on the missionary, abandoning him in a landscape that will surely kill him. When the young man chases after them in desperation, trying to remain with their group, one of the Algonquin almost shoots him. Only the chief's intervention saves his life. After some contemplation, the chief decides to return to get Black Robe and be true to his promise.

Things go poorly. The group is attacked by the Huron and captured. The Huron brutally torture them - but the Algonquin chief points out that this is normal and it's what the Algonquin would have done. The daughter sexually seduces a guard, then kills him so they can escape. As the movie winds to its ending, you find that nobody really wins in the land of fierce fighting, illness and harsh cold.

I really love movies that help to preserve the wonderful Native languages and songs. This is definitely a movie to watch, if for that reason alone - and of course for the gorgeous landscapes.",1153440000,8,2596,4.536324786324786

This is the kind of historical film I always wish for--no burden of the overblown presence of the established ego of a major star (yeah, like stated above, get lost Kevin Costner), an attempt to show what was possibly, or even probably, the actual mentality of the people of the age, and a real attempt to avoid bias and censorship on any side. It's hard to believe that the filmakers could even raise the funding for a film like this, but I guess riding on the semi-success of the De Niro-burdened ""The Mission,"" and on Bruce Bereford's directorial reputation, there was a rare moment in movie industry history when the dollars could be aquired to back a film with this type of integrity. The film shows with expert adroitness the difficulty of belief on the brutal landscape of physical reality. Underlying the conflicts and resolutions throughout is the unrelenting threat of suffering-induced skepticism. The major characters in this film are ethically and spiritually anchored on very very frayed, but repeatedly resilient tethers held in place by the force of will. Whether these tethers should or will snap is always the question. A marvelously spent hour and 41 minutes. Don't miss it.

It's a clash of cultures, with Bluteau trying to convince his Indian companions to accept baptism so their souls will enter Paradise after death, and the Indians thinking he's some kind of demon. Filmed on location in Canada in winter, we are offered scenes of stark beauty, alternated with scenes of stomach-churning brutality; director Bruce Beresford, to his great credit, depicts the Indians honestly and unflinchingly (he shows them torturing their prisoners, for example).

194300,5,1573623903,"There are remarkably few historical movies which give you the feeling of actually being in another time and place. In almost all costume dramas, however accurate the costumes and sets may be, the characters think, speak and act like people of the present day. The issues are modern issues, and the movies are colored by modern political correctness, and by romanticized and simplified views of the past.

Black Robe is a movie that makes you feel ""this is how things really were."" It shows both Native Americans and European settlers honestly in all their humanity and complexity. But the issues are 17th century issues, not 21st century issues. The movie is not self-concious, or preachy, or pushing a particular agenda. It's just telling a good story, and telling it very well.

This is perhaps the best and most accurate portrayal of Native Americans in any movie ever. They are shown neither as noble, politically correct, ecologically sound, wise heroes, nor as racist caricatures. They are shown as real people, and as individuals with their own personal concerns and opinions. There is no glossing over harsh living conditions, violence, brutality, torture, and superstition. But honor, loyalty, love, and closeness to nature are just as vividly present - as are doubt, deception, self-interest, and cruelty.

The French are likewise shown in a real, accurate and believable way. The narrow-mindedness of the Jesuits and their perverse desire for martyrdom are shown along with their deep sincerity and courage. Colonial attitudes and the overwhelming role of religion in 17th century culture are there, but the characters are never caricatures. Neither European nor Native American religions are denigrated, but both are shown to have their flaws as well as their values.

The role of solemn ceremony in both cultures is vividly shown in some of the opening scenes - an aspect of life which has almost disappeared in today's world. There is a feeling of vast distances, and slow, hard travel into the unknown which is likewise missing in our modern world of fast transportation and globalization. We get a sense of the smallness of human beings compared to the vast forests, mountains, and rivers of 17th century North America.

194302,5,1573623903,"Set in New France, Quebec in the year 1634, director Bruce Beresford delivers a powerful and cinematically gorgeous film dealing with the cultural devastation wrought upon an indigenous culture by well meaning but somewhat naive and narrow-minded Jesuit missionaries evangelizing the Canadian Northwest.

The story centers around a young Jesuit missionary, Father Laforgue (Lothaire Blutheau), who is sent on an ardous 1,500 mile journey into Huron territory to aid in the task of converting the Huron people to Christ and his Church. Escorted by a small group of Algonquin Indians and a young Frenchman named Daniel (Aden Young), a long and dangerous path lie ahead.

The cultural differences between Laforgue and the Algonquins' are pronounced and animosity towards the Priest is almost immediate. They begin to question his ""strange ways"" and his dark attire and wonder whether he is a demon sent to destroy them. Instead of addressing him as Father they refer to him as ""Black Robe.""

Along the way Father Laforgue slowly and begrudgingly begins to understand and appreciate the Indians as people and not just potential converts, but cannot reconcile their spiritual beliefs with his own. His inner doubt and turmoil are in stark contrast with the natural beauty of the land and the communal, harmonious spirit displayed by the Algonquin's accompanying him.

Father Laforgue may survive the dangers and hardships of the wilderness, but will his Christian faith survive the challenge of cultural diversity and the honest and open nature of those he hopes to save? The people who ask him the all important question, ""Do you love us Black Robe?""

Joining Lothaire Blutheau is a wonderful cast which includes: Aden Young (Daniel), August Schellenberg (Chomina) and the incredibly beautiful Sandrine Holt (Annuka). The film also contains an enchanting soundtrack by the late composer George Delerue.",1124064000,9,1898,5.3133333333333335

194334,5,1573623903,"Black Robe pulls you in. You don't feel like you're watching a movie. It flows like real life. I can't say enough about this movie. I'd say it's my favourite film ever. I read one review from a left-wing persepctive that claimed that BR was ""neo-colonial propaganda"". This person is an idiot. BR portrays the Natives in the same way it does the French: mostly as ignorant, superstitious brutes. La Forgue's fanatical belief in Catholic dogma at the most irrational moments is identical to the Indians' faith in Mestegoit, the Montaignes' shaman. The Europeans who killed the Indians weren't any more savage than the Natives they exterminated; they were just better armed. The Natives were killing each other long before Europeans showed up. BR captures that.

Other examples are the quick contrasting scenes that cut between Champlain and the Algonquin chief Chumina putting on their ceremonial clothes before meeting to negotiate the escort of father La Forgue to the Huron. Another is the scene where La Forgue tells Daniel that the natives are ""childish"" because they believe in Algonquin religion and Daniel replies that their beliefs are no less ""childish"" than the Christian belief that in heaven we sit on clouds and look at God.

This film isn't about colonialism. It's about the human condition. The message is: modern man is as savage on a global scale as aboroginal man was on a tribal scale. How are the Iroquois who tortured and raped father LaForgue and the chief's daughter different from the Iraqis who behead contractors, or the Americans who deport prisoners to countries for torture?

194335,5,1573623903,"Bruce Bereford's Black Robe was easily one of the best ""bleak realistic"" films of the 1980's.  It's powerful on many levels.

There are amazing performances all around here, but the then (and still fairly) relatively unknown Lothaire Blutheau hits absolutely all the right notes in his performance as the young priest, Father Laforgue.  Strong with all of the unique confidence that possessed only by youth, Laforgue slowly undergoes one of those classic dark journeys of the soul wherein everything, including one's belief system - previously seen as unwavering - is called into question when exposed to a different world entirely.  One can actually feel what he feels here.

Aden Young gives an equally remarkable, if smaller performance as Laforgue's young, idealistic guide who quickly is smitten by the ways of Algonquin.  An odd but strong friendship - an almost mutual admiration - between the two young men develops but which falls sour and which nearly costs Laforuge his life.

Visually, the movie offers astonishing images of the Canadian landscape, simply beautiful even when stark and covered with ice and snow.

Beresford makes certain everything works together perfectly here, from the gorgeous cinematography and acting, to the gorgeous score of Georges Delerue who deftly combines Native American rhythms and sounds with his ancient Catholic-tinged harmonies creating a soundscape as aurally powerful as the film is visually.

The film will resonate strongly for those who enjoy the controversial aspects between various faiths - (and a little of commerce) and remind more than a few of The Mission, whose protagonists shared similar hopes with similar results.

Now I enjoy the DVD regularly and am constantly loaning it to friends.

I would commend three scenes as indicators of the more subtle qualities of this film: (1) The scene where priest Black Robe flagellates himself when he finds himself becoming excited watching others having sex. Note that he does this under a bent spruce about to fall into the river, a symbol of abnormality (compared to other ""trees""). (2) The handling of the sun--the Native Americans' source of spirituality and life--as Chief Chomina at last approaches the island of his visions. The whole sequence on and off the island (remeniscent of a famous Boecklin painting) is exquisitely structured. (3) The deliberately ambiguous ending, the cross in front of the sun. Is it bringing light to the world, or blotting it out?

One final note. Parts of the film were photographed in an estuarial portion of the Saguenay near the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 100s of miles from the supposed route to Lake Ontario.

Tacitus did the same job on the Roman interaction with the Germans--the story being much the same.

Thus Black Robe goes a world beyond ""PC.""  The French ""invader"" is a priest of passionate sincerity and courage.  The French ""higher-ups"" believe, as why should they not, in the civilisation they are, with great difficulty, bringing.  The Indians are not villainous (though sometimes very cruel); nor, in the end, are they either more or less foolish than the French in the maintainence of their own culture.  The one tribe truly converted by the young priest, now dead, is destroyed by unconverted tribes.  This was not hard to predict.  Nor was the ""conquest"" of all the tribes by the French.

The Black Robe reminds me of those classics during the 1960's of Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett.  Another recent image for me is that of the movie the Last of the Mohicans (1992), based on the book of the same title by James Fenimore Cooper.  Not to mention Dances with Wolves with Kevin Costner (1990) and directed by Kevin Costner.  I happen to love most movies where that Native Americas are depicted in story that is uplifting about their lives.  Black Robe was directed by Bruce Beresford, and is based on the novel written by Brian Moore.  I found similarities in both Dances with Wolves and Black Robe.
The use of the natural settings of woods and rivers were fantastic and beautiful.  The use of rivers as means of transportation is very realistic in Native American culture, especially since water is seen as the source of all life.  This film at times seems to be more about the inner spiritual life of Chief Chomina (August Schellenberg) and his quest to follow his vision than about the journey of Father Laforgue (Lothaire Bluteau) to minister to the Indians in Quebec.  While the Father did not show much spirituality, he did however have his memories which seemed very stark compared to the chief's visions.  The differences of their cultures really did stand out in this movie.  The Hurons were used to sharing their resources amongst themselves while Father Laforgue tried to keep things back for later use.  Another culture shock for the Father was that of the Natives procreating at night.  This bothered him greatly, so much so that he was tormented by it and had to leave his bed.  This scene also took place in Dances with Wolves, here again was a white guy (Lt. John Dunbar) sleeping by a Native fire.  Yet his reaction to what was happening brought him into a relationship where he married a member of the tribe and became one of them.  Whereas Father Laforgue cut himself off from relationship and went off alone to do penance.
One phrase at the end of both films caught my attention: 15 years later.  In the case of Dances with Wolves the phrase dealt with the fact that the expansion of white men into Native American territory meant the demise of their way of life.  In Black Robe the Native Indians in Quebec who converted to Christianity became too docile and therefore were killed by other warring tribes after Father Laforgue's arrival.  Interestingly spiritually they knew that this was going to happen.  This film was great, but sadly since it came out not too long after Dances with Wolves, I believe that it was overshadowed by the former film.
For those who want to add to the Native American story collection, it is a great film that could be watched and compared to two other Native American epics: Last of the Mohicans, and Dances with Wolves.",1084320000,5,2794,4.676891615541923
194362,2,1573623903,"To begin with, I think this film is a true cineastic masterpiece. From its hauntingly beautiful score through the breathtaking landscape shots to the meticulous detail observed with any buildings, item of clothing and other equipment down to the last little piece of Native jewellery used, this film let's you immerse yourself into a powerful image of 17th century eastern Canada ""as it really was"". The film is at its best when it illustrates mutual misunderstandings in the encounter of two completely different cultures.

The clash of cultures is often illustrated by sharp cuts between Native and European worlds. These are always interesting, sometimes quite amusing. Often they amount to sheer propaganda of ""savagery"" vs. ""civilisation"". Indians huddle together, fart and copulate in dark, dirty and stinking wigwams while Europeans walk across beautiful Old World city squares conspiciously devoid of beggars, cripples and the omipresent garbage and sewage of the time. Indians practice primitive shamanism in forests while Europeans stride through light-flooded cathedrals and vow to relinquish the amenities of western Civilisation to salvage the infidels (even if ""they"" already cut off one of your ears in the process). Europeans do well-mannered house music in aristocratic mansions. Indians do it like dogs in the dirt. Always, anywhere and with anyone, as the film will teach us through relentless repetition.

The clash of belief systems is personalised in an encounter of the dignified Jesuit priest with an Indian shaman - impersonalised by a ridiculously behaving and profoundly vicious yellow painted dwarf. What could have been an interesting example of Indian attitudes towards disabled and retarded people - worshipping people who are different as a manifestation of the divine instead of confining them to the margins of society - is turned into just another example of the film's leitmotif - the savagery of the barbaric Indian.

When the film was released a New York Times critic lauded the fact that this historical film got by with portraying American colonial history""without villains"". Without white villains that is, of course. Set in a time when every City Hall inquisition room in the Christian west was equipped with arsenals of torture tools beyond the imagination of any Indian, when the Thirty Years War was raging through central Europe where entire populations of large cities were butchered to the last woman and infant while seeking refuge in churches and when one third of Germany's population was slaughtered by armies of fellow Christians, the film centers entirely on what it presents as a realistic portray of ""Indian savagery"". When the Algonquin party with its European guests is captured by Iroquoians (the Algonquians speak neither Algonquian nor do the Iroquois speak Iroquoian but all happen to speak Cree here in fact but who would notice anyway) the male captives are forced to run the gauntlet in their captor's village. Once, badly battered, of course, they had survived this indeed pretty brutal initiation procedure, I , having at least a superficial knowledge of Iroquois culture, prepared myself for wittnessing the usual next step, the adoption of all captives into the tribe. I soon learned that the makers of the film seemed to have an agenda which would not permit such a less than traumatic ending.

It is towards the end that an ambitious yet heavily slanted portrayal of culture clash tilts into point-blank atrocity propaganda. Portraying matriarchic Iroqois societiy with its democratic decision making processes as a male-commandeered dictatorship is in itself a surprising failure given Beresford's claim to show everything ""the way it really was"". One wonders if this distortive rendering of Iroquois social life occurred unintentionally. How could they get such basic things so wrong? However, this appears like a lesser evil compared to the what we are supposed to learn of the treatment of captives by Iroqois. Captured women and children were regularly adopted into the tribe. In fact the Iroqois waged numerous wars on neighbours and absorbed their vanquished foes through something that amounted to genocide by hostile takeover, if you like. There was a time when 25,000 out of 35,000 Iroquois were adopted former enemies. The biggest indian killers of the time were disease, not war. Tribes replenished their thinned-out ranks with captured enemies and could hardly afford to kill them ""unnecessarily"". Male captives were in for a tougher ride and were only adopted after having endured the gauntlet.

The film shows none of this. Instead, the captured boy has his throat cut before his father's eyes for no apparent reason - exept ""Indian savagery"" which is, by definition, beyond any rationality. The captured woman is announced to be tortured to death the next day. The same fate awaits the male captives - although they just passed the initiation rite. One previous commentator hoped that the research done for the scenes in the Iroquois village was profound. Well, it was not. In fact, the makers of the film got everything beyond mere outfits wrong here. This is certainly not ""a sensitive and earnest portrayal of Indians"" as one previous reviewer reasoned.

At the end the film raises ""the profound question"" if it was right to bring the light of Christianity to the Hurons since they were later on ""annihilated"" by their heathen Iroquois enemies (in reality parts of the survivors were adopted into the tribe, others formed the influental Wiandot nation). What the film fails to mention is that it was hardly a Christian ""turn the other cheek"" attitude that brought about the demise of the Hurons but the fact that only partial conversion of the Hurons occurred which split the disease-stricken nation at a time of war when unity was most needed and that the French had chosen the Hurons as their allies and prime proxy fighters in the ""Beaver Wars"" against their Iroquois enemies - and finally let them down militarily when the Hurons needed their support (For some reading check out [...]).

How to rate such a film? Five stars for its technical merits. One star for its often distortive, elaborate defamation of Native cultures. I think that the latter weighs more heavily than the former. Two stars. See it. Carefully. I rented it. I wouldn't buy it.",1082332800,36,6342,5.169425511197663

The black robes were also their to help the French colonize the area, making it safe for others to come over if they all had found the same religion, they could be safe.  The Movie showed how the Indians tried to syncronize catholicism with their own culture and how the Black Robe had gained an insight to their understanding and had compassion for them, with a love for them without trying to exploit them as ignorant savages.

Portraying a Jesuit priest's 1500 mile journey through the Canadian wilderness in the early 1600's, it is a story of God and demons, human relations, and our view of other cultures.  It gives a wonderful insight into the minds of the Jesuits, how Europe came to conquer the ""savages"" and ""save them"" from their false believes.  The filming is wonderful, the landscape and scenery stunning, and the performances very good.  The movie does not wear silk gloves - the harsh reality of the wilderness is showed in its true and brutal form.  Here, only the strong survive, and you cannot be sure that God will save you.

194369,4,1573623903,"Quebec 1634. Jesuit missionaries from France venture bravely into New France (Canada) to convert the Indian savages from their paganism.  That's the historical background of ""Black Robe"", a movie based on the book by Brian Moore.  It portrays the story of a fictional black robe Father Laforgue, who undertakes an arduous 1500 mile journey at the onset of a harsh winter.  Guided by Algonquin Indians, threatened by Iroquois Indians, his destination is the Huron Indians.  He is threatened by the elements, but most of all by the Indian paganism which construes him as a demon.  The plot, however, is neither memorable nor outstanding - it is merely the background for a careful contemplation of characterization and complex questions about culture clash.
Laforgue's companion is the young Frenchman Daniel, and it is largely through his eyes that we see the clash between cultures and religions.  The contrast between the faiths and cultures of the Western Christians and the native Indians is presented from the outset, with alternating shots portraying the ""chiefs"" of both sides preparing for a meeting.  Both cultures fail to understand each other, and believe the other to be stupid and demon-possessed.  At first, with Daniel, we are led to believe that the Jesuit's missionary endeavours are little else than misplaced colonialism and cultural arrogance.  Laforgue is presented as rather arrogant and ignorant, his vocabulary of ""poor barbarians"" and ""savage people"", and his patronizing showing off of Western skills in reading and music and technology (an alarm clock) appears to confirm this impression.  When Daniel suggests that the Indians are essentially Christian in their love for each other, and that with regard to their view of the afterlife the Indian beliefs are no harder to believe ""than a Paradise where we all sit on clouds and look at God"", Daniel seems to be a symbol of modern enlightened man who has realized it was wrong for Western man to force his beliefs on the natives.  Daniel's romance with the Indian chief's daughter seems to be an unnecessary artificial intrusion of an unbelievable story of love at first sight, and appeared to be a concession to Hollywood's need to include sappy romance and sex.  At this point I seriously wondered whether the movie was an apology for white supremacy and colonialism, a defence of multiculturalism, and another example of historical revisionism which romanticizes the Indians as saints and condemns the white imperialists as unforgivable criminals.
But as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that although Jesuit priests such as Laforgue were sometimes guilty of peddling colonialism rather than the gospel, their simple assessment is not simplistic but accurate: the Indians truly are savages who live in darkness. Daniel's multiculturalism is nave, and Laforgue's view that it is a clash between two religions turns out to be correct, for he perceives the Indian religions to be work of the devil, while they in turn perceive him to be a demon.  In the end, Laforgue is proven to be right, for the Indians show themselves to be true savages, engaged in brutal animalistic behaviour.  Their hostility is not just due to the priest's rejection of their beliefs, but is rooted in their very nature.  These scenes are not pleasant to see: the movie portrays their primitive behaviour with all its brutality and passion - unrestrained sex, torture, murder.  The gruesome blood and gore is not for the faint-hearted and will at times make you want to close your eyes.  But these fruits confirm that the apparently simplistic assessment of the black robe is right: ""The savages are living in darkness. We must convert them.""  They need the light of the gospel and renewal of the Holy Spirit, to become like Laforgue, who despite his misplaced colonialism, is sincere in his love to reach out to the lost.  The ending, however, is ambiguous on this point, with Laforgue apparently being converted to some of the Indian superstitions as he makes his final trek to the village of the Hurons.  The tragic conclusion about the annihilation of the Hurons after they were converted is ambiguous in attributing blame for this horror: is it with the Christians who converted them, or is it with the darkness of their own kind who remained unconverted?  Would the indigenous Indians have been better off if they had been untouched by European imperialism?  If the movie has weaknesses aside from his dark portrait of brutality, it would be the ambiguity of the ending, for surely although the Jesuit mission work was at times misguided by colonialism, its identification of the kingdom of darkness was never truer.
Although it features wonderful cinematography of breathtaking Canadian scenery, this is not a pleasant movie to watch.  Unlike most modern movies, the portrayal of violence and explicit sex is never entertaining, but always brutal, dark and representative of primitive barbarianism.  On that point I personally found it rather too graphic and disturbing, and even the depth of the themes doesn't justify being exposed to this kind of darkness.  But in the process it raises very complex and thought-provoking questions.  The action is not fast and furious, but arranged at just the right places to stimulate contemplation.  This is not typical Hollywood, because it gives the subject matter the realism, contemplation and seriousness it deserves.  The blood and gore is all the more horrifying, because it is accurate. While this distinguishes it from the usual Hollywood cotton-candy, ""Black Robe"" is not surprisingly less popular because it requires an audience that can think.  The movie is highly introspective, as Laforgue deals with his own struggles against lust and faith.  But above all, it raises important questions about culture clash.  While it portrays the truth about Jesuit missionaries being somewhat misplaced in their colonialism, it also portrays the truth about the barbarians that they sought to convert.  Despite the weaknesses of the missionaries, in the end it becomes clear that as ambassadors of the kingdom of light, the black robes were truly symbols of light in battling against the powers of darkness.  This is not an enjoyable movie to see, but it its treatment of colonialism and religion it raises profound questions - even if it doesn't answer them all.",1015372800,27,6368,5.127659574468085

Historical fact is frequently a casualty in films attempting to tread the fine line between fact and fiction, but Black Robe treads this line unerringly, and brings into sharp focus a saga whose seeds spawn a tragedy that will play out on the North American continent over two eventful centuries. It contains a sensitive and earnest portrayal of Indians, an honest portrayal of the French colonization effort, a look at the breathtaking and unforgiving environment in which their saga played out, and a real effort to present the whole affair in a reasonably accurate historical manner.

194371,4,1573623903,"This is a very moving film about the clash of two radically different cultures.  The young Jesuit priest, Father LaForgue, although very rigid in  his belief system, sincerely wants to help the Native Americans by bringing  them the Truth.  But his message of paradise has no meaning for the  Alogonquins, Hurons, and other tribes that he comes into contact with. They  cannot understand why he has no woman.  They fear him as a demon because he  reads from books and makes strange signs (of the cross).  He, in turn,  believes they are living in darkness and must be saved. He is fearful of  the vast forests where the devil reigns. There is a great deal of  complexity in the character of Chomina, the Algonquin leader who fears the  Black Robe but who feels honor bound to assist him. Father LaForgue is a  tragic figure, so lonely and confused in the vast expanses of 'New France'.  Why is he here, so far from his mother's comfortable drawing rooms?

Australian director  Bruce Beresford has chosen, in BLACK ROBE, to show us the difficulties you  will encounter if you adopt the second attitude.
""Black Robe""  is the name the Quebec indians have given to Father Laforgue, a jesuit who  desires to reach a Huron Mission situated 1500 miles away of the last  french fort. BLACK ROBE is the story of this trip in the wild canadian  forests. Bruce Beresford, with an objectivity one has to admire, will  present us the efforts of Father Laforgue in order to save the souls of his  companions and the indians' reluctance to accept the religious views of the  man in black.
At the end of the movie, you are a little bit puzzled  because you understand that nobody is totally good or totally bad in this  relation. Furthermore, the jesuit priest, in his black robe, appears as a  wicked demon to most of the indians. For him, Nature is evil. It's a world  where sex and pleasure rule, where the wind hurling in the forest says a  lot more to the listener than all the evangelic speeches in the  world.
Great music and superb cinematography too. Four trailers and a  menu which is not as easy to navigate in as it is good-looking.

194404,3,1573623903,"This is a supremely ambitious film that fails in many areas, mainly because it tries to do too much. Bruce Beresford signed this film and one wonders how much its shortcomings are due to his lack of knowledge, if not understanding, of the subject matter.
Ostensibly a film about Europeans opening up the New World, the story focuses on the journey of a young, Jesuit priest, Father Laforgue, as he travels upriver by canoe in search of new Indian tribes to convert. This is a difficult enough story for a filmmaker, since the real life events must have included long periods of watery boredom. Beresford naturally concentrates upon the main drama, which takes place between the human players. The plot manages to get snagged between the two worlds, real and fictitious, giving the movie a poor sense of continuity, which serves to undermine many of the scenes. For the most part, the movie is simply unbelievable.
The main term used by the Europeans in the film, when referring to Indians, is ""savages,"" and the portrayal of their culture which follows, reinforces that description. A lone voice in the film, that of Father Laforgue's French travelling companion, argues a plaintive case for the integrity of Indian culture.  That is one of the problems of the film as a whole, that a theme, once introduced, is as quickly forgotten and not developed any further. On matters cultural, the film has little to say, in spite of each of the main characters being given their chance to do so.
Now, leaving aside what might have been achieved, let me say a word in the film's favour.  Cinematographically, the film is astounding. Obviously this is not a plus when being viewed on the small screen. However, the camera work is exciting and the images of 16th century Canada are well worth seeing. In addition, the scenes in the Iroquois village in the middle of the film are quite fascinating. One fervently hopes that the research done to produce them was profound. They are rich and exotic and hint at a degree of social development far beyond what is otherwise suggested by the film's action. It should be stated that there is a certain amount of realistic and savage violence on the screen for short moments, which is not for the faint of heart.
Altogether, the film is hardly the success one hoped for. Yet it is an attempt at least, to consider this distant corner of Canadian history and, in the telling, it is not altogether one-sided.",956707200,7,2436,4.756501182033097
194405,5,1573623903,"First, I want to thank all the reviewers here.  It is their reviews of this fine film that tempted me to purchase it (that, and the fact that the director also did ""Breaker Morant""--a favorite of mine).
I'm a big fan of  this genre.  I loved ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Jeremiah Johnson"", and I  really enjoyed ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"", yet  none of these excellent movies compare with the absolute realism depicted  in ""Black Robe"".
This is a simple story set in the early seventeenth  century...a story of a French Jesuit priest who has been charged by his  superiors to canoe to a Huron outpost 1500 miles away (with the aid of  Indian scouts and an interpreter) and help convert the Huron Indians to  Christianity, thus saving their souls.
In this movie the protagonist  isn't some superhero who makes no mistakes, shows no weaknesses, can out  shoot and out ride any man alive.  On the contrary, he is just a young  priest filled with self-righteousness, ignorance, fear and doubt.  But  despite this (or because of this), his bravery is truly unparalleled.  This  is a story of real people fighting for their lives every single day against  the breathtaking harshness of nature and against other Indian  tribes.
This is also a story about the clash between two widely varied  cultures.  This is shown with an uncanny subtlety, yet the effects are  devastating.
""Black Robe"" goes where few movies have gone before, or  since.  It is a movie as Oscar-worthy as any I have ever seen.  The  cinematography is bleak, cold, and unforgiving, as is the story.

The sounds of the cold, harsh wind made me  shiver. I had to get a blanket out of the closet. The movie was not made to  bring in the bucks, it dosen't have a charming, handsome Kevin Costner, nor  does it have friendly, curious Indians who only want to become your  friends.

194407,5,1573623903,"After watching and rewatching ""Black Robe,"" I could not believe this film was more favorably received. Critics seem to have liked it. I never saw it released in Chicago or San Diego. How could such a masterpiece  be buried? Bruce Beresford is an excellent director. Oddly enough  ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" the film most have seen and won a few  Academy Awards pales in comparission to his previous films like  ""Breaker Morant,"" possibly the best courtroom drama ever made.  Then Beresford brings out ""Black Robe,"" a movie that takes a  totally fresh vison of the American Indian. The acting is flawless. The  French and the Indians, thrown togther, literally perceive different worlds  and religions. The late Brian Moore, the author of the novel, wrote the  screenplay, and he spares us very little of the harsh world view, the  harrowing survival in the wilderness, the myth of the ""Noble  Savage,"" the realization of just how hard it was to make a colony  foothold in the New World. You get the feeling, after watching this film,  that there was no foothold, that the wilderness wins, and no religion or  superstition can prevail under such conditions. Man, whether French  colonist or Indian, when confronted with such hardships, rarely conquers  the land. And what a glorious  picture of Native Americans. Never has a  movie given such a vivid, balanced picture of Indian life and attitudes. It  is all about ambiguity. Good Redman? Bad Redman? We see examples of  kindness and brutality on both sides. Few films can create and transport  one into an entire new world and this is what Beresford has accomplished.  In the wake of the so-called ""realistic"" portrayal of the Native  Americans in ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""Black Robe"" jumps  light years ahead. ""Black Robe"" leaves most movie Indian  portraits in its wake. How Beresford did this is a mystery. He avoids  almost all cliches from previous movies and we see, brilliantly,  his  vision, a stark, brutal vision of what it was like to be alive in the 17th  century wilderness. And what a beautiful wilderness, and as the winter sets  in, one can feel the chill in the bones. The tent scenes are incredible,  mixing humor, sex, and bewilderment on the part of the priest, who at first  thinks he is in complete control and will save these ""savages.""  In the end of this great movie, the young priest seems to have been  converted partly to the superstitions that he previously condemned. His  fearfully walks in the snow and ice, showing the landscape in a different  light. Is nature really cruel? Or is it just man's perceptions? Is this  where faith comes in, to face such hardships? That Berseford can squeeze  questions such as these into an unflinching adventure flim is a triumph of  a master film maker. Many moviegoers want to escape to an ideal world, with  happy endings.

I also like to compare Black Robe with Dreyer's masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc, because in the end, through their faith, the protagonists are transfigured.

Black Robe and Aguirre put me in awe, not only at the scenery, but at men like the Jesuit priest-martyrs of North America and the conquistadors of South America, plunging into the infinite green voids, never to return.  But the motivations of the priests in Black Robe -- whether or not you agree with their theology/philosophy -- ennoble their mission, while those of the conquistadors debase theirs.

7798503,5,1573623903,"I was told by a professor that this was the most accurate depiction of Indians in any movie. Plus, it is about the Eastern woodland Indians, which sets it apart. I found it to be a wonderful adaptation of the book. It does not romanticize either side, it just seems to show the hardships and gritty determination to survive and carry out one's mission if life. This is one of my all time favorite movies ever!",1522713600,,409,4.394736842105263
7798504,3,1573623903,"This film had potential - intriguing plotline, a slice of North American history largely ignored/forgotten in contemporary historiography, beautiful Quebecois cinematography, authenticity in the form of real native Huron spoken on screen (certainly a first.)  Yet it came to such an inconclusive and contradictory finale.  We're left with the inspiring closing scene of a humbled Fr. Laforgue ministering to desperate and sick Indians, their malice likewise humbled. Yet the screenwritten epilogue informs us that all was for naught: the Hurons' conversion left them at the non-existent mercy of enemies who largely exterminated them.  So much for the White Man's God, nullifying the whole film before.  A fuller exposition of the mission's fate would have demonstrated this, rather than the cringing inference at its end.

Also the digital transfer was uneven: a lot of jerking motions, like a speeded TV program desperate to squeeze in more G. J. Wentworth commercials. At one point it even broke up altogether.  Still it has its positive moments.",1520985600,,1049,5.404907975460123
