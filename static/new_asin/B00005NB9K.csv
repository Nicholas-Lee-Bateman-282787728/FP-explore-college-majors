8600723,5,B00005NB9K,"This is the epitome of low-budget kung-fu movies. The film quality and dubbing are awful, and the plot leaves tons to be desired... but I love this movie and have seen it way too many times simply because it's exactly what it's supposed to be - badly dubbed kung-fu with lots of good fights, questionable special effects, and a bad guy who gets killed by the hero in the end. If you're a fan of old-school dubbed kung-fu movies, this is a must-have in your collection!",1406160000,,468,4.453488372093023
