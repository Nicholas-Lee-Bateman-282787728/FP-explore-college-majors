The first time I caught sight of it was in South Africa, under the name Knights of the Zodiac. I was instantly struck by the beautiful characters (especially the Bronze dragon Saint Shiryu, hadn't even come across any of the Gold Saint's yet !) and the interesting storyline. Checked up on the internet and found out that the Knights of the Zodiac was in fact a generic version of an anime known as Saint Seiya. SS was a re-introduction to all the anime I used to watch as a kid, caught sight of this about a year ago and I've just received my first 2 SS dvds; numbers 10 and 11. I have to say that I was disappointed in the english version's dubbed voices of Shiryu and Camus. Actually the Knights of the Zodiac's Shiryu sounds like he has a better voice, although that seems rather stupid since methinks the same actor is playing him. Shiryu's voice sounded too gruff for his personality and Camus's voice seemed as if someone had poured a whole ton of gravel down his throat, lit it on fire and then poured petrol/gas on it.

Other than that I'm quite obsessed by SS, not sure if that's a healthy thing for a 23 yr old.

*May contain Spoilers*

This dvd sees the saints going through the 12 zodiac houses with each battle lasting 2 episodes, so this dvd contains Shun's, Hyoga's and part 1 of Shiryu's battle. Shun battles Ares who's hiding behind the armour of Gemini, playing dirty tricks. Got to say that Shun's outfit really get's me grinning, don't think that pink should have been his colour, though it doesn't clash too much with his hair. Hyoga tries to battle Camus but cannot go through with it because ultimately he has to make a sacrifice that is far too dear to him, and eventually causes his death. The last episode sees Shiryu beginning his battle against Deathmask, with Deathmask playing dirty and dragging Shiryu's beloved Shunrei into the fight. We can all guess how Shiryu reacts to that in the next dvd.

Great DVD, loved it and am planning on getting the rest.",1118102400,2,2026,4.479674796747967
8044593,5,B00074CBVA,"At the end of Volume 9 begins the best that the Saint Seiya Sanctuary Saga has to offer. The fight with the silver saints increased interest and enthusiasm, but the fight with the gold saints goes so much beyond that: it is just riveting. The showdown with the santctuary finally started, and there are still 8 zodiac houses to go plus the final battle! I simply recommend this DVD and serie to any anime fan, and given the attention it just needs, it won't disappoint you a bit.

Even though Saint Seiya still doesen't have in the US the popularity and appreciation that showed in countries such as Italy, France, Spain, Brazil and so on, it definetely represents a remarkable anime creation which represented a turning point at the end of the 80's in the anime shows. One more reason why SS is still so widely charming even so many years after its creation.

I personally watched years ago the whole 114 episodes so far released worldwide, and my passion for this anime is never-ending.

Needless to say, there will be sequels of this anime which are already under production and for which I eagerly await.

Hyoga, who is pulled into an alternate dimension, must face his master's master, the gold saint Camus of aquarius! And Shiryu will have to battle an old foe, the gold saint death mask in the house of cancer. Overall, the english dubbing for this volume is great. I especially liked Camus voice. I hope ADV continues doing a great job with these volumes. Saint seiya is one of the greater anime series I have ever seen. I can't wait until I have the whole dvd collection!",1107993600,4,580,4.429906542056075
