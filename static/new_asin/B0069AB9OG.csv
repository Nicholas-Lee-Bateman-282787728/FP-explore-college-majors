8495237,2,B0069AB9OG,"I really wanted to like this drama, because I'm a huge Matsumoto Jun fan, and because of all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, the quality of the subtitles was not up to par. They started out ok, but got progressively worse as the series progressed. By the end, I was having trouble following the storyline. I think all the 4 and 5 star reviews must be from Japanese speakers who do not use the subtitles. I can't honestly recommend  this DVD to non-Japanese speakers.",1339891200,,471,4.674698795180723
