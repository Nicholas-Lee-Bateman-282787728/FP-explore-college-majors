The show started with Carlin, apparently in 2001, thanking HBO for doing this project while placing women's hats on his head. It was silly, not funny. Some of the jokes were: Homeless gay people are in a sad situation; they have no closet to come out of. Tonights weather forecast is dark. The weather will continue to change for a long time.",1510531200,3,511,4.446808510638298

7944426,2,B00005LQ0N,"I received this disc as part of the Carlin Collection box set, and I'm sorry to say I was rather disappointed with it. About half of the material in this compilation is culled from his other standup DVDs included in the set! And I'm pretty sure the other half will see digital video release in their uncut, full-hour glory in the near future. So just grab the other GC standup DVDs, and don't worry about this one.
Actually, even with this dud, the Carlin Collection Box Set is still a better deal than buying the individual platters separately. So go for the box set instead, and pay this disc no mind. Pretend it's a complimentary coaster or mini-frisbee or something. Of course, if your curiosity's piqued about what's on this particular platter... well, there's nothing I can do to stop you, is there?
