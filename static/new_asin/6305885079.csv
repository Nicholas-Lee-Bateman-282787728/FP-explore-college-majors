1084808,5,6305885079,"I watched this movie first, then now reading the original novel.
Obviously, this movie seems going after ""The day of the Jackel"" in many points, and different far from its original.
But I take this movie, rather than the novel.
This movie is free from most of the defects of the original - the lack of consistency (though still opportunistic in some points).
Besides, you can travel the scenes of both of Swedish suburben and South African city (mostly its people's life scenes).
The images are graceful, from which you would feel the dark, cold atmosphere of southern Sweden, and dry South African air.
And I suppose I don't mind the darkness of its images another reviewer pointed out based on the VHS edition - the staff might consider her/his cliticism when they produced this DVD edition.",1043366400,10,793,4.795620437956204

7896788,5,6305885079,See all Wallander productions.  Strong interpretation of the author's original literary effort.  One of 9 original Scandinavian productions of which 6 are currently available.  All are worth the watch.  Each is stand alone.  There is also a tv series worth watching.  Don't miss a great treat but enjoy!,1425168000,,303,5.208333333333333
7896789,1,6305885079,"When the movie started, I thought that the poor film quality and sound was part of the setting and that I would at least have the standard tv series quality.  As the movie progressed, I could not get past the horrible production quality from the sound, to the cheap film transfer.

After having watched the complete Swedish version of Wallander with Krister Henriksson playing the part as well as the ""Wallander: The Original Episodes, Set 1"" (The Man who smiled, Firewall, and The Pyramid) starring Lassgard, I was looking forward to watching this one as well.  I can honestly say that this movie and sound quality reminded me of those movies we used to watch in school off of the projector.  The plot was confusing, and very different from the book which was well written.  This movie version has only one place in my house, and that is in the trash can.  It certainly does not belong next to the other movies in my Wallander collection.",1424476800,,939,4.626506024096385
7896790,5,6305885079,"I had my doubts that the first Wallander would be as good as either of the other two, but I was really happy with this guy. He is a large sort of lumbering Wallander, and I liked him very much. This particular movie is quite complex and extremely well acted. Do yourself a favor and watch all of the different Wallander movies and episodes. Well done!",1355875200,,351,4.333333333333333
7896791,1,6305885079,"I bought this movie and in spite of having the great Jesper Chritensen in one of the roles..

..I could not get past the LOW production quailty from the sound, to the cheap film transfer and boring beginning.

Don't waste your time. Sorry, but it is mediocre and just because Mankell fans such as myself are starved for his material stateside, we cannot pretend this is good to quench our collective thirsts. Lets just be honest! It sucks!",1302566400,2,439,4.615384615384615
7896792,5,6305885079,"My husband and I have read almost all of H Mankell's books.  We love the way this man writes, his descriptions of the weather, the landscapes, the characters; and, his stories - extraordinary!
""The White Lioness"", ""Sidetracked"", ""Firewall"", ""One Step Behind"", the Stieg Larsson trilogy's Swedish movies.  We highly recommend them all!
Anyone reading this, we welcome recommendations!
I recommend the Stieg Larsson bloggers' website for recommendations re writers and movies.",1285718400,,474,5.661971830985915
7896793,5,6305885079,"Not as good as the book this film is based upon, but Rolf Lassgard is great as Wallander!",1207353600,2,89,4.0
7896794,4,6305885079,A strong entry in the unfortunately sparse selection of the Rolf Lassgard series on DVD with English subtitles.  Stays very close to the book.  Good juxtaposition of Swedish and South African landscapes and climates.,1168473600,7,216,5.323529411764706
7896795,3,6305885079,"Fans of novelist Henning Mankell will enjoy this film, if only for the opportunity to see police inspector Kurt Wallander brought to life on the small screen.  This film is only a loose adaptation of Mankell's novel (which is probably too complex to film in its entirety, in any case), and those expecting a faithful treatment may be a little disappointed; however, it succeeds in capturing the essence of Wallander's world, and that alone makes it worthwhile viewing.  It's also a well-paced crime drama, with a suitably nail-biting climax.
TV adaptations of most of Mankell's novels have been made, but so far this is the only one that seems to be widely available outside of Sweden.  Let's hope that someone sees fit to release the rest of them!",1074556800,20,748,4.828125
