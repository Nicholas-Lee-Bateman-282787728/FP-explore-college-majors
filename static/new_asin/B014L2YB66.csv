8731205,5,B014L2YB66,"I love this film.  And always have since I first saw it in the theatre.  The cast is unbelievable, and every performance is top notch.  Great script, funny and literate. So I give that part 5 stars.  The Blu-Ray release looks ok.  It's sharp and the colors are vivid enough, but while watching it, I was thinking that it did not look as impressive as other Blu-Rays I've seen, more like a very fine looking DVD than Blu-Ray.  But still I'm glad it's back in the limelight and hopefully people will discover it, or rediscover it.",1457049600,5,528,4.447916666666667
8731206,3,B014L2YB66,"Impromptu is the story of the real-life affair between George Sand and Frederic Chopin. George Sand, whose real name was Amandine Aurore Lucie Dupin, became famous not only for her novels but also for taking a mans name, wearing pants, and smoking cigars in public. The characters in the film constitute an impressive Whos Who of the music and art world. Judy Davis is Sand, Hugh Grant is Polish composer Chopin, and Julian Sands is Franz Liszt. Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters portray French poet Alfred de Musset and Liszts mistress, Marie dAgoult, respectively. Emma Thompson plays the Duchess DAntan, the featherbrained Frenchwoman who brings all these celebrities together.

This costume drama plays like period soap opera, with sex and naughty behavior propelling the action. Despite conflicting accents and the actors tendency to go just a shade over the top, Impromptu has its charms. Made in 1991, before of the many cast members went on to bigger and more substantial roles, the film has a voyeuristic quality, sort of a Lives of the Rich and Famous: The 19th Century Edition. The public has always been fascinated with the foibles of the renowned, and this picture feeds into that curiosity.

Ms. Davis conveys an authoritatively aggressive manner as Sand, a woman who demanded equality at a time when women were not encouraged to lead a public life, and certainly not engage in romantic rebellion. Grant provides his cinematic charm as Chopin, who inspired Sand with his music.

Director James Lapine has crafted a beautiful-looking movie. His stage training stands him in good stead; his direction keeps the actors on their game and the movie visually interesting, with a sweeping quality suitable to the subject matter. Production design and costumes are lush, and locations compare favorably with the grandeur of Downton Abbey. Bruno de Keyzers cinematography makes even the simplest settings shine.

There are no bonus features on the PG-13 rated Blu-ray release.",1446336000,6,1984,5.1713395638629285
