8158563,4,B000KPQ2FW,"This set of four DVDs would have been great if they had not been heavily overloaded with four introductions that are sectarian, one-sided blabbering attempts to make us think that what these films are about is evil, devilish, ugly, despicable, and a few other things like that. All countries are doing that kind of propaganda, some even call it agitprop, which is a dignified genre in literature and theater with among other names Bertold Brecht but our democrats generally wrap it up in some kind of patriotic and even artistic garb that means something like garment, clothing, wrapping, etc, and has little to do with garbage. Though indeed in reality . . . !

The films are most of them short, more or less short from very short to rather short and they all have qualities due to the techniques used to produce them, the editing used quite freely and the creativity at times to have special effects even before they existed. And do not believe Mlis invented special effect. He invented accidental cut and accidental editing that turned a cow into a tram because the camera had stopped on the cow and had started again on a tram.

We have here real special effects and great editing, without speaking of the animation that is at times frankly creative and even avant-garde, and of the voices and music when there was music (composed by rather inspired composers) and voices after the silent cinema gave way to the talkies. The film on Mayakovski for example is a great example of animation and voice performing. The moralistic tone might irritate westerners because it advocates Soviet morality and history, but just watch the Walt Disney film on Pocahontas and you will have a remarkable film of colonial propaganda justifying the extermination of Indians, once they had been exterminated. There is no contrition at all about her being forced to marry someone she hardly knew after being abducted, Christianized and having given her knowhow on how to grow and cure tobacco.

Anyone who is interested in animated films and in the history of the Soviet Union has to get these DVDs and watch these films. Just use the menu and jump over the introductory political lessons from some western servile writer.

8158564,5,B000KPQ2FW,"This is fascinating collection of animated short films from the former USSR. Broadly describable as propaganda, the films span three periods. The first is from 1917 to 1941 representing attempts to mobilize people to build the new socialist society. The second period spans the war and its aftermath - and the films are aimed at boosting morale and encouraging people to fight the German invaders. The third period covers the post-War era until 1989 when the object was to convince Soviet citizens of the superiority of their system over that of the West - and of the threat they faced from USA and its allies.

The films are reproduced on four discs. The first titled ""American Imperialists"" tries to show the malevolence of the capitalist enemy. ""Mr Twister"" is a tale of an American industrialist who takes a vacation with his family in the USSR. He refuses to stay in the hotel he has booked because on arrival he realizes that there are non-White guests with who he must share the hotel. His Soviet hosts however in the end compel him to accept the company of the guests after a series of pranks and misadventures they engineer and subject the Americans to. The American bigots, in the end, are shown a better alternative in ""socialist humanism"". Highlighting racial prejudice of the enemy was a common theme of Soviet propaganda - in contrast to the supposed welcome offered by the USSR to all. Interestingly, these cartoons were for domestic consumption and not known outside the USSR - at least until after the end of the USSR. Perhaps for good reason. Viewers in Western countries may have been less convinced by the depictions of their own societies than people in the USSR without knowledge of the outside world, even though some aspects of the critique of capitalism are uncomfortably close to the bone - and resonate today against the backdrop of the economic crisis that set in after 2008.",1410739200,,1903,4.819571865443425
8158565,2,B000KPQ2FW,"There's little point commenting on the content of the films themselves, they are fascinating. But if you're going to release a set of obscurities based in specific historical circumstances, you've got to help the viewer a little! The documentaries are awful. What's worse, the subtitles are mostly a digest and not translations of the words at all, as if the producers were worried a modern audience wouldn't detect the propaganda message... and you can't turn them off!",1201651200,2,470,5.116883116883117
8158566,4,B000KPQ2FW,"In his commentary, both on disc and in the accompanying booklet, Prof. Igor Kokarev gives a moving and informative account of life under a repressive Soviet regime.  It's true, Soviet artists worked under severe ideological constraints, and certainly, none of the works presented here are untainted by politics. And yet, does it really matter? Let's take the first and best of the four chapters - ""American Imperialists"": Who can argue, for instance, with ""Black & White"" 's passionate denunciation of American racism, ""Ave Maria"" 's pacifist view of the Vietnam War - or the notion that money can buy political power and influence, as in the hilarious and high-styled ""The Millionaire""?  Tarasov's ""Shooting Range"", which deals with the exploitation of the working class, scores an aesthetic bulls-eye, as do ""Mr. Wolf"" and ""Mister Twister"" - tales of corporate greed and hypocrisy.
On a more upbeat note, Atamanov's ""We Can Do It"" makes the astounding proposal that all nations can work together for peace.
Propaganda?? These are universal themes, developed with humor, imagination and impeccable artistry.
It's a well-packed four-disc set, but the technical quality varies - unsurprising, when one considers some of the source material dates back to the silent era.  The color spectrum appears reasonably vibrant, (as in ""Songs of the Year of Fire"" and ""Shooting Range""), but in general, production values lack the gloss of Jove's ""Masters of Russian Animation"" series and recent restorations by Krupny Plan.  It could have been better.  Still, as an historic and aesthetic document, highly recommended.",1192320000,10,1606,5.33201581027668
8158567,4,B000KPQ2FW,"Extremely difficult to evaluate both for content and presentation, this collection offers a fascinating glimpse into the cultural life of the former Soviet Union.  As the title implies, all these cartoons are heavily propagandistic.  They were designed to instill the values of patriotism, self-sacrifice, and collectivization in the Soviet populace.  As such, it's sure to appeal to anyone with an interest in the history of the USSR or Cold War.  Likewise, the animation itself is generally compelling and frequently beautiful, so animation buffs are going to find this collection very rewarding.

However, as propaganda, these cartoons are extremely didactic and heavy-handed. Even viewers already familiar with classic live-action Soviet cinema will be shocked at some of the messages these cartoons convey.  For instance, in ""Someone Else's Voice,"" cute Disney-like birds drive a magpie out of their forest for singing an American jazz song, preferring quiet conformity instead.  Other cartoons contain songs praising Stalin and advocating blind obedience to his policies.  Many are also abstract, with protagonists that are rarely individuated in the way Americans expect. Characters are usually bland, too-good-to-be-true representations of an idealized Soviet type. Ultimately, it's very difficult to identify with them in any meaningful way. As a result, most viewers aren't going to watch these cartoons for fun in the same way they might watch Bugs Bunny or Donald Duck.  Intellectual curiosity really trumps aesthetic enjoyment here, which means that this collection certainly belongs in university libraries but may not get much play-time at home.

Yet I don't want to scare anyone away.  The company that produced it, Films By Jove, deserve all the support they can get for releasing films this obscure.  Nevertheless, even their presentation has pros and cons.

Pros: the cartoons are organized thoughtfully, given good transfers, provided with more than adequate subtitles, and supplemented with special features totaling about two hours.

Cons: the subtitles are non-removable (which will irritate animation buffs), and the extras aren't really as in-depth as they should be.  Each of the four documentaries contains the same two-minute opening and includes long excerpts from the cartoons themselves.  They are basically explanations of what you've just seen rather than explorations of the historical context.  Sometimes these explanations are helpful.  How else could anyone figure out a bizarre cartoon like ""Interplanetary Revolution""?  (Footnote:  if you haven't seen the 1924 Soviet sci-fi film ""Aelita,"" you're probably never going to get it, even with the docu's explanation.)  Still, I'd like to have learned more about how these cartoons were made.  How were the cartoonists trained?  How did their techniques differ from animation studios in Hollywood?  What was the censorship process like?  These questions don't get addressed satisfactorily.  Fortunately, some PDF files are available on Jove's website, and I encourage viewers to check those out.

It's also worth pointing out that film preservation in Eastern Europe is in a notoriously sad state of affairs.  If you've ever purchased a DVD from Ruscico or Second Run, you'll know that companies frequently have to rely on what's made available to them.  As a result, some of these cartoons are fragmentary (""China in Flames""), lack original soundtracks (""The Vultures""), seem to be cropped (""The Shareholder""), or use such dark prints that they're almost indecipherable at times (""Tale of a Toy"").  But knowing how difficult it can be to track down good film elements from Eastern Europe, I'm willing to cut Jove some slack.  Potential consumers just need to be aware of these problems.

If you buy this set, I have some advice.  By far, the best of the four documentaries is the one of the last disc (""Onward to the Shining Future"").  If you watch this docu first, you'll get a much better sense of the historical context, and you'll be alerted to look for certain recurring images:  capitalists are always depicted as either fat and greedy or ugly and hypocritical, etc.  To get used to these cartoons, it's also best to start with disc 2 (""Fascist Barbarians"").  Some of these compare favorably with propaganda cartoons created by MGM, Disney, and Warner during WWII.  ""Kino-Circus"" is one of the funniest cartoons in the entire collection, and some of the later ones on this disc are among the most visually imaginative. (""The Pioneer's Violin,"" ""Attention Wolves!"" and ""Tale of a Toy"" are disturbing but beautiful.)  I also recommend that you seek out ""A Hot Stone"" and ""The Millionaire"" early on, since they're the best cartoons in the collection.  In my opinion, ""The Millionaire"" is the only one that equals the manic genius you'll find in Tex Avery's work. Finally, it's worth supplementing this collection with some of the less propagandistic animation that Soviet studios were producing during the Cold War.  Not all cartoons from the USSR were this abstract and didactic.  If possible, you should try to pick up one of the volumes in Jove's ""Masters of Russian Animation"" series.  In terms of content, those cartoons are much more palatable.",1183075200,31,5238,5.328867235079172
