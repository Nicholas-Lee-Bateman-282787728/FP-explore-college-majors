2073635,3,B0002B15RY,"It's 1905, Ben and the boys are long gone but the Ponderosa carries on.  It's now run by Bronc Evans (Ben Johnson), one of Ben Cartwright's old hired hands.  His grandkids are there, too.  One's a smart alecky squirt who's also a lawyer, another's a good natured big guy, and the other was last seen crawling out of a second story window at his ""intended's"" house.  Guess which young'un belonged to which pa.

 The peacock network slipped three Bonanza The Next Generation made-for-tv movies in under my radar between 1988-1995.  BONANZA:UNDER ATTACK is the last of them, and it's a decidedly mixed bag.

  The core story is engaging enough.  A rogue Pinkerton agent (Dennis Farina) has been chasing the outlaw Frank James (Leonard Nimoy) for years, and has him cornered somewhere on the 1000-square mile Ponderosa ranch.  Adam's son Adam (Jeff Phillips) finds the wounded James and defends him at the point of a gun from the swarming Pinkertons.  It's a temporary reprieve, of course, and the bulk of the movie is dedicated to saving James from the murderous Pinkertons.  BUA works well when it's takes itself outside under the tall pines.

 The trouble comes from the side-stories involving the young Cartwrights.  Michael Landon, Jr. plays Little Joe's son Ben Cartwright and, well, he simply isn't an accomplished actor.  (Dan Blocker's son Dirk, a better actor, also appears as a newspaper reporter.) Adam's sidebar love story is more distracting than anything.  The 75-year-old Ben Johnson, a fine actor in his day, is simply too old for the role.  Jack Elam is wasted as the grouchy cook Buckshot.

  On the other hand, Nimoy is good as the wounded and played out Frank James, and Dennis Farina adds an appropriately menacing air to the maniacal Pinkerton agent.  And the movie does begin with the burning map intro, not always available on video releases of the original series.

  If you're a fan of the original ""Bonanza"" series you won't miss much if you pass on this one.",1096761600,17,1983,4.859281437125748

2073638,5,B0002B15RY,I was surprised but it was nice to see that all of the Cartwright boys had children. It was sad to here how Hoss was killed they never really said on the TV show. Although it was not the same as the show it was a good movie.,1380153600,,224,3.6875
2073639,5,B0002B15RY,It was everything I thought it would be very good and clear i wish you hade more episodes of the new generation of Bonanza,1377993600,,122,4.125
2073640,4,B0002B15RY,"As a kid, it was my favorite show, and I waited almost impatiently each week for the next episode.  It was so great when they made these TV movies, but also bitter-sweet, as the original actors were mostly all gone by then.

I enjoyed this video, and it was as I remembered seeing it on TV many years ago.",1355097600,,305,4.1525423728813555

2073642,1,B0002B15RY,"It's not the same,even if Landon JR. had some thing to do with this movie! The  First real BONANZA was made is the only one that could be of any worth watching he Cast in the early years made the show, and Young Joe (Michael Landon) was one of the actors that made the show, and it was made possiable for the old/ middle age to remember. It's like produceing a new Dukes of Hazzard what were they thinking? Not so hot with the people that Grew up watching the Old TV SHOWS, I Love all the Old TV SHOWS, made for TV was a Great time for me 1or 2years of age growing up. When the Westerns were on it was Daddy and my time, leave us be, be quiet. Cold night me and Daddy were cuddled up in bed, our time Mom wouldn't let no one mess with her TV, No Westerns were allowed on her TV, So me and Daddy took the TV over in their bedroom, sure do miss my Daddy and the good old days. I still watch BONANZA and WESTERNS, and remember those days Me and my Daddy,Sure Do Love Him Dearly and MISS Him so very much, have and still do buy BONANZA/Westerns and remember the good old days and at the same time I have a lot of GREAT Memories of times spent with my DADDY! GOD BLESS my Daddy these 2 BONANZA DVD""S Just bought just for you and me, and I know you are and will be with me when I am watching them, Love my DADDY Passed away 3 years ago, but you will always be my Hero and Westerns Partner.",1321056000,,1383,3.904255319148936
2073643,3,B0002B15RY,"In the last year I have become re-acquainted with the Bonanza shows in syndication on TV Land and I record every one so that I won't miss an episode, so when I came across the movies that were made later with the children of these stars I love so, I was ectastic.  Truthfully my expectations were higher than what was produced. I don't get why Dan Blocker's son who looks so much like Hoss, was cast as a different character.  I read later that there were a lot of contradictions for both films in the wife of Little Joe and the brother of Ben. Ultimately, I'm not sorry I bought this film (especially since I paid under $10) and I will still be a Bonanza Fan.",1307232000,,660,4.23015873015873

Nimoy is fun as Frank James, Ben Cartwright's grand kids are along for the ride, Richard ""Shaft"" Roundtree is here too, and veteran Western actor Ben Johnson is great. This one is well worth adding to your Western collection.",1146700800,,281,4.64

8025330,3,B0002B15RY,"This is a second-generation of Bonanza, a soft western as were the prior Bonanza series. A friend of Cartwright is now the head of Bonanza, and children of the former occupants, young adults with guns, live there. One of the sons has mixed feelings about remaining because he is in love with a girl who is a fantastic pianist who wants to go to Paris, and she is love with him. Her father tells the young man that if he really loves her he will let her go.
The drama in the film involves an elderly Frank James who has been pardoned for his crimes. A Pinkerton man who murdered the wife of the man who took Cartwrights place on the Bonanza is chasing a wounded Frank James determined, despite the pardon, to kill him. He leads a band of cutthroats. The people at the Bonanza, two of whom had fought with Jesse and Frank James during the Civil War, decide to help save Frank.",1455235200,,874,4.303030303030303
