7845320,5,6303399967,"This chopbuilder video is absolutely awesome. Regardless of what style you may play on the guitar, this video will increase your dexterity, hand strength, speed and knowledge of the fretboard. Most people cannot look past the dated clothes and hair styles, but those are the ones who really have no interest in furthering their growth as a guitar player. The video breaks down into several rounds, each one to a different technique on the guitar. It has tablature and standard notation that comes along with it. I think this is hands down one of the best investments a serious guitar player could make. But when using it be careful, it can get dangerous if you don't take breaks or days off from using video, if you don't your muscles will get to you leading onto injuries such as tendonitis. Anyways a MUST buy!",1078185600,,812,4.685314685314685
7845321,3,6303399967,"This vid was rated as beginner to intermediate on a different website...wrong.  Ideally, before buying this title, you should have the Major, Melodic and Harmonic scale modes already memorized.

Nonetheless, it definitely hooks you in at first because Franks playing is so fluid and flawless, but trying to keep up with his speed is practically impossible.

I did learn a lot of priceless stuff from this video, but, halfway through, got overwhelmed and put it aside.",1040428800,,467,5.118421052631579
7845322,1,6303399967,"I went out to my local guitar center in hopes of getting a good video to help me with some different techniques. I asked a guy that worked there and he suggested Chopbuilder to me. I thought 50 dollars was way too much but I gave it a try and bought it. When I popped it in the VCR, my boredom began. He sits on a chair playing through chromatic exercises and playing scales. If I wanted this I could go to a website  and then go to guitar mania. This video is no good! It didn't teach me a thing. I am looking forward to returning it tommorow and getting John Petrucci's video instead. Take my advice, don't buy it!!!",1016150400,,618,4.107438016528926
7845323,5,6303399967,"Chop Builder is a great way to learn, practice and revise your chops and lines. Its main focus is on stamina and fretboard knowledge, they don't sound like the usual pairing do they? But that is why this video is exceptional, not only do you have a true physical workout but it also, (sometimes without realising it) expands your fret board knowledge at the same time. I don't think that this video would be perfectly suited for beginners as a knowledge of scales and arps will help in picking up examples quicker.
  The video has a very clear format and the lay out of examples is also very clear. A simple way to describe this video is and kind of aerobics video for guitar, because after you've been through the video,you feel that you have had a substantual workout.
  Gambale fans will be pleasesd to hear that FG takes you through even a section on Speed Picking which was incredibly useful, I was applying this technique into my own playing shortly after I picked it up, and it sounds awesome in band situations, it adds another dimension to your playing, and opens your eyes up to a very individual technique.
  FG also takes you through alt picking exercises(warm ups), modal workouts, and a lot more.
  This video can be used by any style of guitarist, as it lays down a guitar concept that can be applied in any style. I am a jazz guiatarist and this video has been very informative, but I also know players from other genres that have also highly rated this video.
  Frank advises you to use this video 2 to 3 times a week to get the best results, but personally I use it everyday before I start my practicing session.
  The card girls that come on in between each 'round' make you laugh at the beginning, but they tie in with FG's great sense of humour. FG has got a great sense of humour and comes over as being a friendly 'approachable' guy, and his teaching is extremly clear and precise.
  Gambale sums up the exercises at the end of the video by saying, ""No pain, no game"".",1011657600,,1991,4.434065934065934
7845324,1,6303399967,"First of all, let me just say that while I respect Frank Gambale as a player, this is not a video showcasing his knowledge. I just bought this video, and 5 minutes into it I feel like I am watching an exercise tape. The girls were a cheesy touch... They don't show you fingerings, they just show Frank sitting on a chair and playing nonstop for 75 minutes. Furthermore, he's playing scales up and down the neck. yay. This tape is too standard as far as knowledge goes. Strictly a technique and speed tape to show him doing chromatic runs. You'd be better off trying to dissect a Stevie Ray Vaughan tune. While it may be an OK tape for an intermediate player, it's definitely not worth the price tag. Way too much money.  Go for the Paul Gilbert video, or Steve Trovato, or Steve Morse. Yngwie's is pretty good too I hear.
This book is just a tab book with a video of someone's fingering hand. Yay",992563200,,896,4.333333333333333
7845325,5,6303399967,"Frank Gambales ""Chopbuilders"" workout video does exactly what the title implies. This video is really excellent! The first time out of the cellopane, I was so into it, that I went for two hours and didn't realize that the time had passed.  The booklet shows you each exercise in both notation and tab.  Each exercise builds and readies your fingers for the next one.  It's set up so that you get hooked into playing along with the video because the exercises are very musical. It also helps that you play along with Gambale accompanied by a drums and keyboard track that sounds great. In essence, your playing really cool sounding songs that are based on runs, scales and arpeggios. With each practice time, my playing is more defined, well-timed and confident. This is all the stuff a good guitarist knows he or she has to eventually know, but thought was too boring to learn. You WILL become a better guitarist with this video!  It reminds me of that old wives tale about the young farmer that went out into the barn everyday and picked up a new born calf. By the time the calf was two-years old, the farmer could pick up a two thousand pound bull.  You won't regret picking up this video.  -Chas",980812800,,1198,4.5488372093023255
