8201124,2,B000RK4K5E,"A certain red-envelope service refers to the main character as ""lovable loser.""  I think they say that because he's so progressive.  They show him spending time with old ladies and being friendly with his gay, Cuban-American co-worker.  I can appreciate the PC vibe of this character.  However, he has a dead-end job and just got an eviction notice, but he buys his friends and almost anyone else beer.

This film has bad acting and bad actors with bad timing.  Every other word out of his mouth and that of his buddies is ""dude.""  This movie should be condemned for the same reason that Judd Apatow's are: they make plain-looking males look good, but all the female characters are super models.  In both examples, John Doe can get the hot woman by the end, but there is no space for Plain Jane.  She can never use her jokes or vibrant personality to get a hot guy.  These type of films try to challenge injustice, but only so far as it helps a group of men, not both genders.

Since this movie deals with a winning lottery ticket and takes place in a hot, American city, I really think it bites a lot off of ""It's All about the Benjamins.""  I think some viewers may be shocked about the diversity in this film.  Though the main character is white, the film tries to be true with how heavily Cuban Miami is.  There is Spanish speaking throughout the film and Cuban flags everywhere.  People in middle America may be shocked about that.",1214611200,,1435,4.486486486486487
