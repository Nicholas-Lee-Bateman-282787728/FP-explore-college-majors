1745499,3,B00006FD8W,"Now here's quite a unique piece of anime. It starts off as horror, then slows down to a simple drama, then ends as a fantasy/action anime. Of this 60 minute film, the first 15 minutes were interesting and drew me in, the next 30 minutes went slowly by as the story slowed to a crawl, then the final 15 minutes were brilliant as the awesome final battle took place. Some of the art was just amazing, particularly the shattering stained glass window that Kianu emerges from. The fact that Kimera is a sexless being is kind of sick seeing as there is a strong romance with it and another guy in this story. Anyway, this is somewhat of an intellectual/gore/fantasy anime. I wouldn't know what kind of a recommendation to give this, as you can see with my overuse of slash bars. Rent it, see if it fits your tastes.",992908800,,810,4.406666666666666
1745500,1,B00006FD8W,"Im sorry but this movie was a disapointment, It really did leave you unfulfilled. I felt that the storyline and the animation was and is a major disapointment. Its about alien blood suckers that want to take over the human race. Extremely borrrriinnngggggg. I felt it should get a star for trying.",972604800,,297,4.730769230769231
1745501,2,B00006FD8W,"This is being called an erotic/thriller/horror title.  First off this is not in the least bit erotic.  There is one very stupid sex scene (thank  god) and Kimera looks like a man the whole time.  The movie is sort of a  mix of Dracula and Species, but both films pulled the story off better.  The whole thing seemed rushed and the story and characters truelly suffered  from this.  Plus, like I said before Kimera looks like a man the whole  movie (except for like a two minute dream sequence that made no sense).  The movie could have been so much more if it was longer and more fleshed  out.  Also the one sex scene really wasn't needed and you shouldn't buy  this tape if you want it because it is supposed to be erotic.  Plus the  main character is always bleeding from the head so I am a bit suprised that  he survived due to the extreme loss of blood through the whole movie.
They had some good action, but I really didn't care about the outcome  because I didn't like any of the characters.  If they made this movie  longer (it is only 50 minutes) it would have been better.  The plot was  non-existent, and even though some movies can get away with it this one  died because of it.  The sad thing is the ending leaves an opening for a  sequal.  If they do make one I hope it is longer and better (although the  way it ends maybe the sequal could be good).
So pretty much this is a  rental at best.  I would really hesitate before buying it.  Oh one last  thing, the main villian looks like a guy from Dragonball Z! Oh, remember  this is not an erotic film in the least, and Kimera looks like a man (the  only way you can tell is because she is naked the WHOLE movie).",967939200,,1675,4.186119873817034
1745502,1,B00006FD8W,"I gave this anime a rating of 1 star because I could've give it any lower.  Those people who gave it a good rating are people who have never seen any real anime before and were impressed by the gratuitous sex and violence.  It nothing special. The animation is sub-par, the plot is all but  non-existant and the storyline will leave you shaking your head for days  trying to forget it.  If you have never watched anime before I recommend  starting with Ninja Scroll or the Sailor Moon movies.  If you watch anime  frequently then all you need to know is that you will hate yourself for  wasting a hour or so of your life watching this.",950400000,3,635,4.358974358974359
1745503,1,B00006FD8W,"I'm sorry to have to berate the other reviewers, but at the time that I'm  writing this 7-out-of-10 of them have given this movie 4 stars or better.  Myself and three of my friends, all of us having seen a large amount of  anime in the past, watched this piece of garbage, and frankly, we were  appalled.  The animation is sub-par, the plot varies from nonsensical to  non-existent, and the quality of dubbing on the English-language edition is  horrendous.  In general, the movie only gets worse as the show goes on  until it climaxes in a needlessly confusing splatter of unnecessary and  overdone violence.  Not to sound judgmental, but I suspect the previous  favourable reviewers were simply anime novices who were wowed by the showy  novelty of animated blood and the small amount of pathetic sexual content.  Hopefully, after they've seen a little more of the genre, they'll realise  just how awful ""Kimera"" really is.  In a nutshell, my friends and  I were agreed that this was not only the hands-down worst anime we had ever  seen, but in some ways arguably the worst movie we had ever seen, as well.  Thank God for Blockbuster and its ""Love It Or The Next One's  Free"" policy.  You better believe we collected on this one.",950313600,5,1232,4.690140845070423
1745504,4,B00006FD8W,"The point of vampires from outer space is kinda far off. If your a vampire fan I would recommend  Vampire Hunter D, before this one. But for most of you just now starting off in anime should not  really buy it, renting it  might be smarter. The graphics in it were cool (except for our flat chested  female.) The music was perfectly fitted in. The dubbing could've been a  little better. But for me this one will still on the top 10 list of my  animes. I am guessing because it is really different from most vampire  movies.",947721600,,524,4.285714285714286
1745505,4,B00006FD8W,"A surreal, erotic animated feature created by Kazuma Kodaka, the Japanese manga (comic book) artist who has also produced ""Kizuna"", two volumes (VHS) of which is also available through Amazon.com.  Excellently  animated, dubbed into English very well -- my only argument against this  anime would be the translation.  The biggest example of which is that a  certain main character is inaccurately portrayed as a dominantly female  being.  Bad enough that Kimera HAS female parts... but c'mon!  All of  Kodaka's works that I'm aware of feature gay men, and ""Kimera"" is  a stab into sci-fi macabre that works so well in mainstream exactly because  Kimera's 'swishy-ness' can be taken in another way... Sigh.  But aside from  the implications of a storyline that at least comes off adequately to the  Western viewer (""Just pass it off as more surrealism!""), I do  admit that I found myself watching it over again within a few minutes of  finishing.  The dynamic of a cereal salesman stumbling upon a mysterious  beauty (whatever gender Kimera is!) in a setup that's vaguely X-Files-esque  is truly unique.  And just wait til you experience Shiro Sagisu's score, a  techno remake of a familiar classical piece (name escapes me at the moment  -- I remember hearing it in one sequence of Disney's ""Fantasia"").  I recommend buying this title.",939513600,4,1335,5.050691244239632

7967585,2,B00006FD8W,"The anime would probably only appeal to fans of the original manga (comic.)  For those not in the know, Kimera should be refered to as ""he"" rather than ""she.""  I am not surprised the english released changed it to ""she."" though.
Not being fluent in Japanese, I can only guess at the plot, but the manga is fun to look at.",1063065600,3,321,4.245901639344262
7967586,3,B00006FD8W,"Although most Otaku (read 'Anime Snobs') berate Kimera for its very unusual structure and the liberties ADV took with the original Japanese production, the film remains an intriguing, fast-paced erotic venture into the ""some things are best left alone"" genre.  Built around the concept of vampires actually being aliens, parts of the plot are quite predictable.  Nonetheless, it holds the viewer's interest through good use of role reversal, steady action and appealing visual structure.  The feature is intended for a somewhat more mature audience, as it deals with sexual typecasts and includes graphic violence.  Certainly not suitable for young children.
A number of different anime titles have dealt with this plot line.  However, few have managed to pull it off with the degree of credibility and shuddery uncertainty that Kimera achieves.
Many of the plot mechanisms are trite in the extreme.  The son of the director of a top-secret military/scientific project, along with his best friend, find a way to by-pass security and get themselves in where they shouldn't be.  Stumbing across an obviously alien but strangely beautiful creature being held in stasis, the pair manages to release the prisoner, and the story develops from there.
Classic science fiction/horror this isn't, but it is a very enjoyable hour's viewing, particularly to those with an open mind who don't try to judge older anime by today's standards.
Is this a top pick that you should run out and buy right now?  No, it isn't.  Nonetheless, it is a very enjoyable feature that belongs in any major anime collection.  Even for an older anime feature, Kimera has some bite.",1043539200,3,1648,5.138576779026217
7967587,1,B00006FD8W,"This movie was in no way entertaining to me. It was decent visually; However, The story was short and pathetic. It tried to be deep and engrossing but failed miserably. It was rushed along and didn't improve as the movie progressed. I perfer sub titles but the voice over for this film was done quite well. All the sexuality in the film was kind of over the top. All in all, i felt that it was cheesy and read out like a wannabe Stoker's novel.",1034467200,8,444,4.235294117647059
7967588,4,B00006FD8W,"Only 2 negative points on this anime.
1), the volume on the English sound track is quite LOW. My DVD player is a SONY DVP-S570D. I had the volume cranked to the max with headphones on and I still had problems hearing the english track. So, for customers who only like to enjoy these anime in english dubbed you will probably be disappointed.
2), Profanity is regulated to the english track. (I guess the producers assume that the consumer wants profanity. It doesn't help the story.) The japanese track is better.
I give KI-ME-RA a 4, since I enjoy viewing anime in japanese with subtitles. They have better Voice Actors too.  : )",1033516800,6,630,4.575221238938053
7967589,1,B00006FD8W,"One of Japan's flops which I'll proudly trump. This movie is [garbage]. I've seen the dub. But that doesn't change my opinion about the whole package.  If you take a bathroom break during the middle you haven't missed anything. Too many flashbacks one rape scene. This movie is tasteless... The plot is pretty flat(if you can call it a plot that is). There is no drama,action or redeemable traits in this movie
