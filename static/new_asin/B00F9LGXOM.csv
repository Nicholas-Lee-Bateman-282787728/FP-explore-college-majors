5972511,2,B00F9LGXOM,"This is free on prime and that is the only way i could ever watch it. The acting isn't terrible, because i feel like there is so little dialogue to base an actual opinion off of it. The first forty minutes are establishing shots of the haunted house, and of the actors and what ""jobs"" they have. I don't fully understand how this all made sense, because one of the ""biggest"" haunted attractions in the country, or whatever, they said, only have a small crew of people working for them. How does that make sense? I can understand smaller haunts having that few designers and things. This just felt like a poorly thought out haunt. I will give the movie credit for the props, because on a haunt scale they were pretty neat, not scary, but nice to look at.

The plot is boring, and doesn't show up for a long long time (once again about forty five minutes in). You'd think after a few kills things would start adding up, but nope. Even with a security team, they decided to fling in there didn't make sense, like...where were they during everything prior?.
There's just a lot that didn't work, mostly the plot, mostly the decisions on what to spend the most time on.
I mean it's free, so give it a chance if you are that bored, but i fell asleep during it, which is weird for me.
Also the ""jump scares"" are annoying, i kept having to adjust my volume because i understand that jump scares involve sound effects, but come on... that loud? like in a theatrical viewing, sure, but in a direct to dvd format, not so good.",1459468800,2,1514,4.368794326241135

5972526,4,B00F9LGXOM,"The ""House Of Horrors"" is actually a real-life haunted house attraction in Buffalo, New York where, every Halloween, they change themes and put on one hell of a scary show, The makeup and props are better than most of the stuff you find in most major Hollywood productions, so director/screenwriter/cinematographer/editor/special effects technician Dan Monroe made two fictional horror films at owner Tim Bunch's establishment, the first on being HOUSE OF HORRORS: THE MOVIE (2009; Tim Bunch has a small role in this film as a deliveryman) and the second one being this one, that was made in 2012 but not released on DVD until 2015 (Which Tim Bunch has a major role). Since the real-life haunted house offers some of the best gory props that money can buy (and they are damn good; good enough to have the ""House Of Horrors"" being named the best Halloween haunted house park in America a few times in its 15 years of existence [as of 2015]), there is not much more needed to make this film scary except some physical and infrequent CGI effects that cannot be performed live and this film has a few very good physical effects, while having a story line that makes very little sense. It should be noted that some of the park's real-life employees appear in this film using their real names (including Tim Bunch), although in over-the-top versions, while other actors have fictional names. That doesn't mean they don't die in this film, though. Quite the opposite; some of them die very gory deaths. It should also be noted that the first half hour seems like a long commercial for the theme park (showing the establishment's name on screen on a black background a few times and Tim Bunch giving a real-life interview to a Buffalo news reporter), but then all that bull stops and we get to the meat of the story. A building code inspector, Doug (Doug Brunch), comes to the House Of Horrors to perform his yearly code inspection. He sees employee Kage (Kyle Garrison) working on a bloody corpse prop and the Doug says he's more of a Christmas guy than a Halloween one (the cross hanging around his neck is a dead give-away). Since Doug stands around 6'6"", is bald and well-built, Kage offers him a job as one of the park's psychos, but he politely turns him down. Kyle leaves the building to do some business, leaving Doug to do his thing. Almost immediately, the electricity goes out and Doug has to use a flashlight to traverse the haunted house's many hallways, being scared to death by all the theme parks bloody mechanized killers and one of them calls Doug by his name (At that time, I would have defecated my pants and beat a hasty retreat, but Doug continues his inspection). He enters room after room of bloody haunted house goodness, but then hears a young child laugh and goes to investigate (My underwear would be sagging down to my knees trying to hold all the s*** that was coming out of my ass). Doug enters a room where a mechanized female in a rocking chair is sitting with the skin missing from the lower half of her face, but then the rocking chair stops (At this point, my white crew socks would have turned brown). He takes a closer look at the woman sitting on the chair and she suddenly springs in front of Doug's face and he notices the room is full of dismembered dolls' heads mounted on the walls (This is the time that my socks would have turned green, from my urine mixing in with my now-brown socks, with me then fainting and passed out in my urine and defecated-filled clothes). Doug then finds a room with an eerie Satanic altar (it doesn't look like it has been touched for years, as it is full of real cobwebs, not the fake spray-on kind) and we immediately know he is in trouble because we see a red P.O.V. shot taken from his back (Hmmm. I wonder what creature loves the color red?). Doug touches the altar and then he immediately rubs the crucifix around his neck and runs for his life, only to have his huge frame flung through the air and attach itself to the top of a large wall like Jesus on the Cross (It's a well-executed scene). He then burns to death when a large bolt of fire appears (one of the few examples of CGI). Dusty (Michael Riso) is the man put in charge by Tim and he gathers all his employees together and tells them they have a month to build two haunted houses inside this giant warehouse and says the theme this year will be ""The Gates Of Hell"". He assigns everyone a particular task. Dusty puts Kage in charge of making sure everything gets done on time and like all groups there is one idiot, this one mentioning to Art Director Jamie (Danielle Tewell) that she is a psychic and hopes she doesn't blow her brains out like her mother did. We then see Father Michaels (Michael O'Hear; the only actor returning from the first film in the same role) watching the head of Jesus blow off the desktop statue of the deity crucified on the cross, just as the second hand of his wall clock stops. We then see a newspaper article hanging on the wall with a photo of him, the headline saying ""PRIEST ADMITS TO SEVERAL SUICIDE ATTEMPTS"". Father Michael is not your normal priest, as his office is in the back of a strip club, he has written a book on demonology and makes a living by charging not just an outrageous price for his book, but also holds seminars telling people that Hell, in fact, doesn't really exist (He's a complicated man, who is still a priest, but is a man of mystery). We then see an 80's-like montage scene of all the workers getting the two houses ready while some heavy metal music plays. Jamie is always being drawn into the Satanic altar room, like some force is pulling her there. Colin (Steve Podosek) is in charge of taking photos of the progress of the houses daily (for their yearly brochure) and he and Dusty look at the slides he took (they see a topless girl in one of the photos, bump fists and Dusty tells Colin to ""print it'). Dusty sees a slide of Tim giving the camera the middle finger but notices something strange in the background (I had to freeze the frame to see that there is something like a red eye staring through a hole in the wall over Tim's right shoulder), so he tells Colin to ""print it"". The air conditioning in the building goes out and Tim tells Kage to go to the roof and fix it. As Kage is going there, he sees Doug's burned inspection report, while we see someone adds an object to the Satanic altar. As Kage is on the roof trying to get the air conditioning unit to work (it takes a kick to get it working), he hears the same child's laugh that Doug did earlier in the film. Something unseen (with a red P.O.V.) chases Kage across the roof and a bolt of fire hits him until there is nothing left but a skeleton with a little flesh on the ribcage. Someone dressed in a creepy clown costume kills a female employee by stabbing her in the vagina with a machete while in a bathroom (we see the offal fall into one of the toilets). In the film's most comedic scene, maintenance man Pops (Ronald ""Pops"" Garrison), brings in a pretty girl to audition for one of the roles in the Halloween show. Even though the girl doesn't have a car, can't scream and can't act, she has great set of breasts, so everyone gives her a ""10"", even though her ""scariness factor"" is below a ""0"". Jamie, Dusty and Colin discover blood on the wall next to Kage's shirt and hat and call Tim, but he tells them Kage is fooling with them and to ignore it. Dusty and Colin go to a lecture by Father Michaels to show him the photos, while Jamie traverses the woods and finds a small cabin hidden there. Inside the cabin is a nearly hairless creepy old woman who said she knew Jamie's mother. The old woman warns Jamie that the Satanic altar is actually a lock to the actual Gates of Hell and if it becomes unlocked, there will literally be Hell on Earth. The old lady then disappears into thin air. Father Michaels is very disinterested in Dusty and Colin's photos (and the fact that they didn't spend $50 for his book!) until he sees a photo of the Satanic altar, and he also tells Dusty and Colin that the altar must not be unlocked. Back at the haunted house, a man wearing a human skin face mask repeatedly shocks a tied-up girl with a cattle prod, she being unable to scream because her mouth is sealed with duct tape (Someone should really do an article about duct tape being used in horror films, because it is one of the most-used horror tropes, even beating the opening of films that use old newspaper articles to fill the audience in on the history of a town or person). When the killer removes the duct tape, blood comes pouring out of the woman's mouth, but she is still alive and just unconscious (The killer eventually lubes-up a hand grenade and shoves it up her hoo-haa and we watch it explode as the killer enjoys a good cigar).Two security guards are watching the cameras, when they see a figure in the Satanic altar room, so the older guy sends the younger girl guard to go check it out, but the killer enters the security office and kills the old man by bashing his head in. Since the cast is dwindling, we have to ask ourselves who is the person that can unlock the Satanic altar (it's someone we all know). How many more people will die before we find out if the altar will be unlocked or stay locked? Colin finds a homemade DVD that is full of a worker's ""best-of"" compilations of his kills (we see a auditioning girl get shot in the head and another girl having a spike hammered in her eye) and that person blows off Colin's head with a shotgun (probably the film's best effect). Someone dressed in a creepy creature costume decapitates Dusty. Father Michaels shows up at the haunted house and shoots Tim (yes, Tim is the killer) and then hands the gun to Jamie. We think Jamie is going to shoot herself in the head, but she shoots Father Michaels, because he is actually an evil person who knew how to open the altar. Jamie walks out of the House Of Horrors alone, but she has actually opened the Satanic altar by killing Father Michaels (the whole place breaks out in CGI fire and we all know that CGI fire looks about as real as a Playboy model's breasts), as the old hairless woman appears and thanks Jamie for being so stupid and gullible. The Devil and his many minions appear in the fire and Jamie then shoots herself in the head, while the old woman says, ""Like mother, like daughter."" Evil wins once again.  There's not much I can say about this film that I haven't already said, except to mention that there are some welcomed sight gags (instead of the internet search engine being called ""Yahoo"", it is called ""Yippie"") and one liners (Colin tells Dusty to go to Tim's house to search for something because ""Tim's at a Gwar concert and he will be there for a while.""). The makeup and special effects are all above par and make most Hollywood films look like amateurs. A lot of care went into making these props because they were meant to scare real people. The decapitations are excellent (Watch Colin's frame-by-frame to see where they substituted the real Colin for the fake one; it's almost as good as the head explosion in CHOPPING MALL - 1986), but most of the gory violence is just kept off-screen (We don't see Tim stab the girl in the crotch, but we see the after-effects. Same for the grenade blowing up inside the girl's hoo-haa.). The Satanic altar plot is a little far-fetched and confusing (Exactly what unlocked the altar? Father Michael's death? If that is what opened it, how?), but you have to admire Tim Bunch for showing his establishment in a less than flattering light. I know they are only playing fictional caricatures of themselves, but Tim and his staff do a good job of pulling it off. This is also a thousand times better than any other film released by Brain Damage Films, as they are known for releasing SOV dreck I wouldn't let my dog take a dump on. This film, on the other hand, is professionally made and is entertaining, once you get past the self-promotion bits during the first 30 minutes. I can think of a lot worse ways of spending 91 minutes and if you are a fan of haunted Halloween houses and how they operate, this will also give you some more entertainment value. We need films like this every once in a while so we can put our brain in neutral, but this is still tasty cotton candy for the mind.

A lot of very cool practical special effects, but pretty bad CGI. When you remember this is a comedy-horror, though, the CGI becomes laughably bad and doesnt detract as much as if the movie took itself seriously.

Acting was as expected, though Danielle Tewell (Jamie) stood out as a cut above, talent-wise. Was surprised to see on IMDB this was her first and only role to date. Not hard on the eyes, either :)

The story has the very grounds and props at the House Of Horrors take on supernatural aspects as demons flow into the haunted attraction when one of the guys opens the gates of hell.  House Of Horrors: Gates Of Hell is a fun, horror story that is meant to entertain and showcase the real star-the House Of Horrors haunted attraction.

 The film has a cool, complex story with plenty of drama and suspense. The acting and directing are both a bit above low budget amateur ability. The acting does suffer somewhat as it becomes obvious most of the cast are just trying not to forget their lines. Now about the special effects, House Of Horrors: Gates Of Hell does rely a bit too much on that nasty companion of modern film-making, CGI. In some of the scenes the lower scale computer effects are acceptable. Mostly the supernatural or paranormal elements. However the CGI blood, decaps and such is really a tacky approach considering the obvious talent attached to the project.",1430870400,6,1138,4.766497461928934

It is  more of a horror comedy, but it still has decent scary moments.

8613492,2,B00F9LGXOM,"The problem I have with haunted attraction themes in horror films is that the intentionally placed objects and fake monsters used to create scares often dilutes the atmosphere.  Characters and viewers alike are exposed to these scary costumes so often that it's hard for people like me to change my mindset and find scariness in the *real* murderer or demon hiding somewhere in the building.  When something scary *does* finally happen viewers often just think it's part of the attraction.  There's never any true build-up to a suspenseful moment because the surrounding scary costumes makes everything feel like a cartoon or a staged event.

Another problem is that the writing is often confusing and leads to things that make very little sense.  The story is usually extremely unorganized.  Characters often roam around lost in these haunted attractions while the costumes and set pieces lash out and scare them.  Meanwhile the actual monster lurking around no longer feel like a concern.  Haunted attraction themes make me question if the characters are actually being killed, or if the ""killings"" are just part of the attraction and it's all staged for the purpose of entertainment.  Movie writers probably like the concept because it gives them the chance to toy with viewers emotions, but I think it's best to avoid haunted attraction themes in horror movies because, in my opinion, it's really hard for these type of films to be effectively scary.

With that out of the way, how's the movie?  It's not very good I'm afraid.  To be fair it probably is a small notch better than most haunted attraction movies, but that's only because the ending has a couple nice twists and *is* actually suspenseful.  Everything good about this movie happens during the final 3 minutes.  Otherwise this movie is filled with the same problems and cliches that most haunted attraction movies rely on.

These characters are also really unlikable.  They don't get along with each other, and it's baffling that the main character gets picked on the way she does.  Her name's Jamie and her mother killed herself.  She's the set designer of the group.  Instead of getting sympathy these characters criticize her and her mother.  Jamie even walks out of the room angry in one scene.  It's really odd her fellow workers would react in such a way.  The group becomes fixated on one photo in particular that shows eyes behind one of the workers.  These eyes aren't part of any wall design.  Jamie takes the photo to a priest, but he seems more content having a few drinks and watching barely dressed women walk around.

This movie relies heavily on the costumes as a way to hide the monster or demon lurking in the building.  The costume of a little man with a bloody mouth riding a horse seems to be one the characters take notice of often.  A lot of the writing's just bad.  These haunted attraction workers appear on TV and brag that they're attraction is much scarier than the others since their costumes won't break and fall on people's heads.  The workers also interview people.  One guy says he wants to work at the haunted attraction because it's fashionable, and the other says he needs a place to work while on parole.  They hire the blonde woman who can't work on weekends.  If they're going for humor here it misses the mark.

The scares are often jump scares.  In the very beginning we see a building inspector walking around the hallways.  He feels a strong evil presence the more he walks down the hallways even though we don't feel anything.  He runs back into the main room when suddenly a strange force lifts him up and slams him into the back wall.  The movie shows crosses and Jesus' head exploding several times.  Other scares include one of the female workers running from a man wearing a costume and holding a knife only to find herself trapped in a bathroom and cut in the... female area, as blood drips in the toilet.  This same killer chains another woman in a hallway and electrocutes her to the point blood drips from her mouth.

One character explains the backstory, and it's really lame.  He says that only pure blood can lock the gates of hell permanently, and mentions a lock passed down for centuries is meant for those that want the hidden festations of evil to inherit the earth.  If the altar is changed and the lock is open, so will the gates of hell and absolute evil will again reign supreme.

However the story is supposed to be that Jamie goes around looking for clues related to that strange photo with eyeballs, along with clues related to the odd occurrences going on in this haunted attraction.  Early on she sees a faded image of a demon figure sitting in a chair.  Later on she has a discussion with this same demon.  It tells Jamie that only with pure blood can the gates of hell be permanently resolved.  SPOILERS!  The demon uses this same line to trick Jamie at the end.  She thought by ""resolved"" the monster meant closure but he actually meant bringing hell into this haunted attraction.  We see the demon set the entire place on fire.  The priest and Jamie's mother are both here now. ""Like mother like daughter!"" the monster says.

Avoid this movie folks.  It's really bad.",1500249600,,5207,4.7087486157253595
8613493,3,B00F9LGXOM,"Buffalo's haunted house has an altar that will open the gates of hell. Some demons slip through and kill people before opening night.

This is the same group of people who did ""House of Horrors: The Movie.""  Daniel Monroe is also responsible for ""Fairy Tale Theater: The Movie"" and ""Shoot-Out: 50 Years of the Whacky Wild West"" apparently under the impression that another worth doing will have a colon in the title. The horror house itself looked fairly cool with neat effects. However those effects are not realistic enough to use as horror film props, like the dead guy on the roof which looked like such a prop. The plot was simple enough and the ending a bit stupid involving a discussion of the definition of ""resolved.""
