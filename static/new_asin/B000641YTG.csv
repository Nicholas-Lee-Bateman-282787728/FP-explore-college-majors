So far I've just watched the Steven Wright interview. It's only a half hour long - but it is Great!!
Honest, sincere. Insights into Steven as a Comedian & as a Human Being. Very genuine!!
Couple quick clips of him doing stand up. Keep in-mind this is an Interview - Not a performance.
Thanks Steven!! Thanks Alan (R.I.P.)!! Scott M.",1484956800,,434,4.4375

8038104,5,B000641YTG,"Back in the early 90s, the late comedian Alan King performed a great public service by engaging some of the finest comics, actors, writers, directors, and producers of the 20th century in wide-ranging personal interviews that are a pleasure to watch and quite revealing to boot. A few of the comedy legends on his show were his forerunners, and some were his contemporaries, but many were rising stars whose generation brought a new sensibility to comedy. King displays exemplary warmth, wit, and wisdom as host.

There are two volumes -- Gold and Platinum -- in the ""Comedy Mind"" series. They are also available as a combined set. Each includes 10 half-hour programs (since commercials have been excised, the total length of each DVD is about four hours). The ""Gold Collection"" contains extended interviews with Neil Simon, George Burns, George Carlin, Mel Brooks, Buddy Hackett, Rob Reiner, Carl Reiner, Dennis Miller, Garry Marshall, and Jerry Seinfeld. The ""Platinum Collection"" features Billy Crystal, Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, Carol Burnett, Steven Wright, Howie Mandel, Charles Grodin, Norman Lear, Whoopi Goldberg, and Robin Williams.

The interviews, while often funny, are not simply an opportunity for stars to crack wise, as they might on the Tonight Show. They are instead thoughtful, timeless explorations of the craft of comedy. I found them fascinating viewing, and I recommended them highly.

As generous as this sampling is, there were at least 57 people who guested on this series. I'd be interested in watching even more episodes, and I look forward to a DVD release of the full series.
