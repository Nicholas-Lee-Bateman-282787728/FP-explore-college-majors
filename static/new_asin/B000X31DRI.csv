8226781,1,B000X31DRI,"I saw a 'Black Mamba' film some 30 years or so ago from England & I thought this was that version when I bought it. Big disappointment.
The Black Mamba snake didn't make an appearance until late in the DVD & it seemed as though the Black Mamba for the title was an after thought as the snake is not the main 'charactor'. The title could have been any of several more pronounced themes running throughout the video. I wondered if the title was chosen to capitalize on the English film's notoriety. If so it sure 'sucked me in'.",1244678400,3,526,4.3232323232323235
