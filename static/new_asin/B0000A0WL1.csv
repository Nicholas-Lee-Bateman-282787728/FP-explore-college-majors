7995206,4,B0000A0WL1,"Sometimes when I look within African-American cinema, it always seemed to be portrayed as Comedy within the theater these days. There really seems to be nothing about Drama and a love story, that really seems to break within the eyes. Once in awhile when that happens, I watch BET and some of the original flicks they've televised. A few of them are really quite good, and some of them need a little improvement. When I heard that one of the good ones, After All was set to come to video I was so happy. The film was based on the book ""After All"" by Lynn Emery, one of a handful of books by Arabesque novels.
The 1999 film stars Holly Robinson Peete, from 21 Jump Street fame. In this film, she portrays Michelle Toussaint, a news reporter who tries to work her way to the top, from a reporter, to anchorwoman. Her main objective, is trying to uncover her past, as well as a fearful mother who wants to prove her son is innocent from a scandal involving Kent Plaza. During that time, she also meets her beau, Anthony, played by D.B. Woodside. He  becomes her cameraman in the beginning, but also along the way becomes her beau and lover. He tries to remind Michelle about the difference between the white and black side of the past, and realizes how much that is as a difference in life and her friends from the beginning. Not only does she get a beau, but also an assitant, Kellie S. Williams. You may remember her as Laura Winslow from the ABC then CBS sitcom, Family Matters. Her assitant is a little bit cocky, but really detemined to get it right. Along the way, Michelle also uncovers that Anthony's uncle is also a part of the drug dealing in Kent Plaza, played by Michael Warren. His character was tough, but also mentioned that he did the drug dealing, to get the money to put Anthony through College, and a future. He knows that well from the beginning, as a cocky well-minded businessman, but gets caught along the way at the latter point.
All that I can say is that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen to come out in years. I loved it when it made it to the airwaves on BET, and I still love it now. I really don't think a lot of people will look toward this film, unless it hits the Box Office, but I think it is an incredible movie. I just hope that BET doesn't try to stop airing made for TV films like this one. It is one of the best.",1069632000,33,2360,4.267857142857143
