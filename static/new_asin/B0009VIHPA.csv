8067465,5,B0009VIHPA,"Yes, I am a producer of this fabulous project and also an owner of the DVD. I use the product frequently in my personal life, to entertain and relax, and felt the need to clear up any questions about this DVD.

The ""Art Plasma"" DVD is designed to fill that blank screen in the center of your living room with beautiful modern art paintings. It also features a classical soundtrack or a relaxing ""Chillout"" track.

Each painting is transfered to the DVD from a high resolution scan which reproduces the artist's work, in stunning fashion, on any widescreen TV.

Plasma Window has been a pioneer in the art of using the television set as a virtual canvas to display beautiful paintings. So much so, that Plasma Window has been featured in dozens of the nation's foremost publications and the ""Art Plasma"" DVD was just featured as one of HGTV's hottest new products on their hit show ""I Want That!"".

Some potential buyers may not understand the concept of using a standard movie length DVD as a virtual art screensaver for your TV.

This DVD is not a documentary on Modern art, the period, or the artists.

It is simply a unique product that lets you display the world's finest art on your TV with a classical music soundtrack. Nothing more, nothing less.

Enjoy the art!

8067466,2,B0009VIHPA,"This product is kind of goofy.  The video quality is ok, but it's hard to control the flow of the art, and when it gets to the end of the art, it automatically goes to this fireplace screen that is just a fireplace burning.  I didn't want that, but you can't turn it off.

Some of the art is kind of cool, but if you want this playing in the background for a party, I think you can do better.  Otherwise...I'm not sure what you would use this for.",1198972800,,447,3.9887640449438204
