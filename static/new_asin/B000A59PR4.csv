2359350,5,B000A59PR4,"I agree with many of the reviews here that this is a VERY low budget film, but when you watch it and consider what this ""low budget lawsuit"" did to earn international freedom of speech, it's well worth it.

This is not a thrill ride docu, but the facts that it covers are fascinating and important.  It interviews Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation) and Colin Cambell (The China Study), and it covers nearly 15 years of footage (the lenght of the case being covered here alone makes it worth the ride).

The extras are really good, too.  Even a thirty minute version of the secret tapes with the meeting with the McD's execs are included here.  If you enjoyed Fast Food Nation, you should give this a go.  It's low budget, and yes the court room scenese are bad enough to be funny, but they are all read from the acutal court transcript.  All in all, this is a very important docu about the most important subject facing many of us today--corporate and governmental abuse of power and wealth.",1173398400,3,990,4.4972067039106145
2359351,3,B000A59PR4,"The film starts out in Star Wars fashion with the text: ""A long time ago there was a company that made lots of money by selling bits of meat between two bits of bread. Many people were employed to put the meat between the bread and many animals were killed to be the meat. A friendly clown persuaded children to love the company. Some decades passed and all was well. The company became very, very rich. Richer even than many countries. And then some people wrote in their newspapers than eating lots of the meat and bread could make people ill. Other people said on television that too many trees had been cut down and that the workers were unhappy. This made the company very angry. The company looked around the world and saw that in England there was a special law that could stop people saying things the company didn't like. And make them say sorry.""

This documentary is about a famous court case involving two activists and the McDonalds corporation in the UK.  The film was made over a ten year period, involving you in the actual true life story as it unfolded.  The documentary Super Size Me is a more professional film with a much larger budget that covers similar content and has a more exciting presentation.  However, even though the film admittedly has somewhat of a ""low budget"" feel, it is still an important, informative and inspiring one.",1170288000,7,1358,4.599173553719008
2359352,5,B000A59PR4,"McLibel is a documentary expose of the fast food industry and the legal systems that protect corporate giants from accountability. It is the story of two people in England who refused to say they were sorry for exposing correct information about McDonald's food production and employment practices. These two ordinary citizens were sued and they spent years defending themselves, with no money. It ended up being the longest court proceeding of its kind in British history.

I won't reveal the outcome. This film covers these two citizens over a period of YEARS and, although it is not a ""blockbuster"" level production, the foundation is excellent and I think it should be required viewing and material for discussion for all middle school, high school, and college students.

I have bought three copies of this movie and shared it with many friends. I hope others will do the same.",1156204800,8,882,4.993197278911564
2359353,5,B000A59PR4,This movie was so informative. I loved it and encourage everyone to see it. The fact that two ordinary people were not intimidated by a hugh corporation it great.  I think that the average person would have given up in a couple of years.  But this couple firmly believed in their rights.  Highly recommended to all.,1147305600,2,315,4.589285714285714
2359354,4,B000A59PR4,"A pretty good documentary, and a nice addition to the much funnier ""Super Size Me"". It may seem a little ridiculous that these two ordinary people would want to fight such a huge corporation on their own, but if you watch the DVD, you'll see that this couple truly believe in fighting only for their freedom of speech.

The best part about the DVD is that you can hear 27 minutes of secret audio taken during two meetings with some McDonalds big wigs.",1142380800,10,451,4.433734939759036
2359355,2,B000A59PR4,"McLibel follows the incident in the UK where McDonalds filed a libel suit against two everyday citizens, gardener Helen Steel and postman David Morris.  The two concerned citizens passed out pamphlets in front of a McDonalds restaurant attempting to inform customers of the downside of patronizing McDonalds, such as unhealthy food content, the corporations predilections for wasting natural resources, low wages, and animal cruelty in obtaining their meat sources.

McDonalds, using an existing UK libel law to order a public apology from the two citizens and stop the distribution of the pamphlets, never thought that these two everyday people would take the libel case all the way.  Through court proceedings on the libel charges, where they were forced to defend themselves and McDonalds spent millions of dollars, all the way to managing to overturn the UK legal system to allow free speech against public corporations, this film covers their important story.

However, the film is done on a zero budget, and with the usual British enthusiasm (I'm being facetious) is about as interesting as watching my lawn grow.  The re-enactments are cheesy, the interviews flat, the live footage boring, and the overall length far too long for what content the film had to offer.

Yes, this was an important part of freedom of speech stretching across the UK, but I would recommend looking the info up in a library rather than watching the film.  I gave it two stars for the important content, but you would be better entertained searching out the information on your own.  This is a low budget film with no finesse.",1142121600,7,1609,5.0452830188679245

However, I think the documentary could have been a little more exciting. The re-enactment of the court proceedings is not that great. I know they were working with a very limited budget. I would have also like to have seen all the settlement meetings on the DVD. I do think this documentary is worth watching, and would advise residents of the US to watch it to learn about the historic case.",1126569600,6,552,4.421568627450981
2359357,3,B000A59PR4,"McLibel is a little like Super Size me, where McD is uncovered for its practices and food.

8074406,5,B000A59PR4,"An inspirational film about two people who put their freedom and property on the line, in standing up to a system wherein a plaintiff with sufficient funds can extort a false declaration of error from a defendant--a criminal libel system that regularly protects the powerful from public scrutiny and criticism.  It is an exciting story made into a truly enjoyable film.",1421539200,,369,5.049180327868853
8074407,5,B000A59PR4,"Completely unaware of the so called 'McLibel' case until SBS (Australia) aired the original 55 minute version of this documentary, I was immediately enthralled by its subject matter.  The fearlessness of the two people who allowed McDonald's to sue them over the content of an anti-McDonald's leaflet they helped distribute is pure inspiration.  Recommended for any viewer who feels smothered and overwhelmed by large organisations and corporations of any sort.

Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach have done a superlative job in bringing this complicated and elongated trial to the screen in (ironically) an easily digestible way.  Naturally the focus is on the two outspoken activists involved - Helen Steel and Dave Morris - and the immense burden of proof placed on them with no legal aid available.  This documentary is about them, their extraordinary hard work and their highly daunting experience both in and out of the courtroom.

Some may desire a more balanced view of the case, showing McDonald's side of the trial a little more clearly.  If so, you should seek out McDonald's own lavishly produced version of the case.  What?  They haven't made one?

Highly entertaining, well directed and well-paced.  Helen and Dave, you are still my heroes after many years.",1408147200,,1267,5.161764705882353

They had the all the odds stacked against them: the lack of resources, money, legal aide, but they had the truth and an unwavering commitment to their beliefs.

8074410,4,B000A59PR4,"Inspiring on a story level, if less so on a film-making level.

Two working class British activists are sued by McDonald's for a pamphlet they put out accusing McDonalds of making unhealthy foods, exploiting its workers, etc.  Under the archaic British libel laws, all the burden of proof is on the defendants, and somehow these two plucky, broke (if occasionally annoyingly nave) nobodies fight McDonalds to a stalemate in court, while costing McDonald's millions in legal fees, and causing them an absolute PR disaster.

While the story is terrific, the re-enactments, especially of the courtroom scenes are awkward, and the over simplistic idealism of some of the couples' political theory (`why can't McDonald's simply give half of it's profits to their workers?') can be a bit much to take.

Still, it's good to see something that makes you realize the little guy can win now and again.  Worth it for
that bit of uplift and inspiration in a cynical time",1302307200,,958,4.9625
8074411,5,B000A59PR4,"Two activists campaigning against McDonald's by distributing pamphlets on the streets had their small grassroots group infiltrated by up to seven spies, paid by McDonald's.  Finally they were sued and asked for apologies.  They stood up for what they believed in, and didn't want to apologize.

A Libel court followed, in which big corporations always have had significant advantages : a jury was not allowed, court procedures were secret and legal assistance to the two activists, Helen Steel and Dave Morris, was not provided.  Happily, a bunch of volunteers showed up to help them.  They defended themselves against the best lawyers money can pay.  It would end up in the longest trial in British history !  Two and a half years.

It is important to know money can't always buy lies.  For the judge, the arguments in the original pamphlet against McDonald's was sufficiently proven in seven points :

* deceptive ads
* exploiting children
* paying low wages
* being anti-union
* animal cruelty
* bad working conditions
* fast food causing heart diseases.

Other four points were not sufficiently proven by the activists.  However, considering those two heroes fighting McDonald's with a mere 30.000 pounds - provided by sympathizers - against the 10 million pounds McDonald's put into their defense, this is an incredible victory anyway.

Furthermore, since the rights of the defense were not at all respected, the activists took their case a step further and went to the European Court of Human Rights, where it was acknowledged that they had their human rights and their freedom of speech violated !

Free Speech vs. McDonald's : 2-0.

This is an important movie, since it shows Big Corporations can be defeated by ordinary citizens, like you and me, when we stand up for the truth !",1272153600,,1788,4.953020134228188
8074412,1,B000A59PR4,"I am not a McDonald's sympathizer and in fact I have not even eaten at McDonald's in probably over five years.

It should come as no surprise that McDonald's, a global organization that for decades has been raking in the profits, is often times held in a negative light as being nothing more than a money grubbing organization making civilization fat. We have all heard the horror stories associated with fast food consumption and the business practices that fast food companies often employ.

So when the film McLibel came up as a recommendation in the trust ole' Netflix list, I figured what did I have to lose to gain some additional fodder for arguments relative to the Big Mac.

Answer to what did I have to lose: 85 minutes, the length of the movie.

McLibel was a terribly boring film attempting to highlight what seemed to be a somewhat interesting case that took place across the pond in England.

Directed by Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach, the movie tells the story of two British activists Helen Steel and Dave Morris who were part of a group that sought to promote social justice on several levels. Part of their mission was to attack McDonald's in terms of both their economic policies and their overreaching global endeavors, as well.

As any good activist would do, Steel and Morris took to the streets seeking to wage an information war against Ronald McDonald, Grimace and their pack of friends. With literature, leaflets and their voices, Steel and Morris wanted to disseminate as much information to the British general public as possible.

However, what ended up happening was some covert countering against their actions by individuals associated with McDonald's. Spies ended up coming to their meetings to learn more about the work that Steel and Morris were trying to do on their end.

The documentary gets its title from the fact that Steel and Morris were in fact sued by McDonald's for libel and slander, charges which the activists flat out denied. They felt as though it was more a case of McDonald's seeking to silence the voices of dissent more than it was that they were in fact in violation of any laws.

The movie jumps around a bit from interviews to sort of biographical or historical glimpses back to facts that preceded the making of the movie. The absolutely worst part of the documentary is when there are perhaps the most hokey reeenactments of the court room setting for the trial that McDonald's went through with against the activists. These dramatizations of the courtroom setting seem more as though they could be a skit from a British comedy show than a factual and professional documentary.

Nominated in 2005 as the Best British Documentary at the British Independent Film Awards, it is clear as to why the film was nominated and did not win the category. At the end of the film the viewer is sort of left with the notion that really nothing much was learned in the film and the overwhelming thought is, ""Well, no duh."" The film seems almost as though it was made as a way to thank Steel and Morris for their work more so than it was made to really show others factual information about the topic at hand.

Of course there was no reaching out to the other side of the table clearly evident in the film which makes me question why you would not want both sides of the issue. We learn plenty about Morris and Steel and about how great the director must feel they are but we do not get to see what McDonald's position was during the whole ordeal. Had this been done, I might feel a little bit differently about the overall quality of the film, except for those terrible courtroom reenactments.

McLibel sort of had the capability to be considered a somewhat decent film with at least the basis of  a good factual story to tell. However, the film fell prey to becoming nothing more than what appears to be a bunch of friends making a film about how great they are. The quality of the filmmaking is quite poor and even that makes the film tank even more.

McLibel simply leaves this viewer wanting to know one thing: where's the beef?",1229126400,4,4078,4.638002773925104
8074413,2,B000A59PR4,"OK, it's interesting because it's an important part of history, but, hoo boy, are them there Liberals oh-so-preciously pleased with themselves.

Politically, I agree with the verdict, i.e. their claims about McDonald's were about half correct. (I also agree with the International Court, that the UK's libel laws have been way too strict.) I do not necessarily agree with the defendents in their sweeping claims about fast food destroying the world, or even whether the world has been or is being destroyed to the degree they think it is. And then there are those stubborn questions of personal responsibility and whether or not creating a Nanny State is all that wise a thing to do.

Definitely an OPumentary, this work does not even attempt to present anyone else's take on the issues (i.e. McDonald's arguments, or any arguments from a more centrist or right-wing position). Some of the smugness, especially in the commentary, is downright childish and provided more to stroke and titilate the vanity of the already converted than to make any particular point. The project overall is saturated with the usual unfortunate assumptions. Anyone who disagrees with us is evil. And greedy. And stupid. Tautologies reigh, and legitimate reason and argument are rarely insight.

8074414,3,B000A59PR4,"This film tells the tale of 2 people in London who got challenged by Mcdonalds for slander, and actually fought back.  I thought this film was a decent look into British law, and to think that a coperation could squash the voice of decent by threatening to sue, unheard of in the US unless gross neglegence is in play. Besides, the effort corperation would have to go through to get all the little guys would be difficult in this country, I guess it must have payed off in Britain. Essentially, the two people were able to fight a big expensive legal team and win About half of the claims filed against them, not bad. But also, they proved a bigger point that the british system was flawed, and legal representation needed to be provided to these civil actions.  The 2005 follow up show them at the European court aguing this point, and winning it.  Neat story, worth a watch.",1180483200,3,876,4.49685534591195
8074415,4,B000A59PR4,"What happens when two environmental activists come head to head with McDonalds in court? One side has billions of dollars (or Pounds since this is in England), unlimited human resources to produce evidence, witnesses, and lawyers, and the other side has... two environmental activists. It doesn't necessarily turn out as you'd expect.

McLibel is the story of just such a scenario. Beginning with events as early as 1988, this low-budget documentary unfolds the tale of two activists (Dave Morris and Helen Steel- a postal worker and a gardener, respectively) who refused to bow to McDonald's demands, and instead ended up facing the fast food giant in court for a libel case over an anti-McDonald's pamphlet they had handed out.

The footage is fairly low-budget, but it hardly matters because it is edited together in such an expert story-telling fashion. With almost 20 years of footage unfolding bit by bit, it's hard to look away. The audience watches as the case that was supposed to end in 4 weeks ends up lasting 2 and a half years. Through the introduction of the internet, the two defendants are given a broader audience and thus able to call in more expert witnesses to help them.

Interviews with Fast Food Nation scribe Eric Schlosser, and several other experts on the subject help move the plot along and add substance to this delightful documentary. The court reenactments are a bit forced, considering they have actors playing the roles of the characters in court, but I guess it would be difficult to reenact the court testimonial in any other way. Also, it feels a bit as if the defense is over-playing their hand when they try to lay the blame on McDonalds for the McDonalds litter lying around the streets and the overly mechanized qaulity of a McDonalds kitchen. They are a business after all.

Also, even the defendants themselves acknowledge that they almost feel bad for McDonalds for being so singled out in the trial. For, as they say, McDonalds isn't the only business that's having a negative impact on the world, they're just the only one that tried to sue them for libel.

Overall, though, the audience will find themselves cheering for the two unlikely heros, Steel and Morris, as they plough through hardships in their personal lives and make a firm stand against almost insurmountable odds in a case that ends up breaking the record for the longest trial in English history. Later they go on to trial with the English government itself, which is a separate story altogether.

The DVD extras include a painfully exposing 27 minutes of a secretly taped meeting with McDonalds executives trying to settle out of court. This 27 minutes alone is enough to convince anyone that McDonalds is not on the up and up. That may seem like old news now, but without such people as Dave Morris and Helen Steel, it might not be.",1180137600,,2845,4.819672131147541
