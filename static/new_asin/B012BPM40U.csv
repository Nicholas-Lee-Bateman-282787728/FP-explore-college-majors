7344770,4,B012BPM40U,"The first glimpse we get of Jake Gyllenhaal in Southpaw consists of his character preparing for  a pivotal boxing match at one of the biggest venues in the United States: Madison Square Garden. His trainer is wrapping his hands as he blares hip-hop from his headphones, all of this part of his process when getting ready for a fight. Were quickly swept into the ring, where the blows are harsh and the blood flows. These scenes - the ones that are uncompromising and relentless - are the best in the film. And particularly, when Gyllenhaal is at his most remarkable.

However, the movie is considerably more about a tragic event and how his character is forced to deal with the aftermath. This incident involves the death of his wife, and occurs only a few scenes after the ones I just described. This leads Billy Hope, the undefeated prize-fighter who Gyllenhaal plays, to lose his child to protective services and seek a new trainer after reaching the lowest point in his career. More than anything, its about his character trying to redeem himself (both in his daughters eyes and in boxing). And his new mentor and coach Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) is helping him to achieve that.

For the most part, I found the movie to be an enjoyable ride. It certainly has a dark tone, that to be expected, but its up close and personal in a way that few studio-made films have been as of late. Gyllenhaal, as usual, puts his all into the performance. By all means, he IS this character. But as good as he is, some of the supporting cast (namely 50 Cent) aren't able to keep up. Theres also a slight pacing problem, with several scenes that go on just a few minutes too long, this resulting in a movie that feels sluggish at times and certainly couldve been tighter. But its definitely a solid drama worth seeing, and Jake Gyllenhaals strong performance will help you overlook the majority of its issues.",1437868800,28,1897,4.623145400593472

Southpaw

 People who enjoy the tension and violence of boxing films will surely like Southpaw.  People who enjoy magnificent acting will enjoy Jake Gyllenhall's portrayal of the boxer Billy Hope.  This role follows hard on the heels of his astonishing performance in last years Nightcrawler and we now have Gyllenhaal at the top of the pile of living screen artists... if not at the top of movie stars in terms of box office draw.  In Nightcrawler Gyllenhall played so well a character so odious that people rushed to the water closet after the film to get a good strong wash up.  His Bill Hope has all the qualities we expect in a pro fighter.  He can stand pain, he can take and give punishment, his drive and determination have no equal-he can fight and win.  But he has been stunted in his emotions to the point that he can hardly express himself to those he clearly loves deeply.  He has no educational attainment that we notice nor does he come up even to average in intelligence.  He cannot control his own anger.  He seems to think that his life operates as a series of discreet, random events.  None of these failings make him a person that we like.  Gyllenhaal perfectly produces for us a man doomed by his own failings rather than a man whose courage overcomes those failings.  Billy Hope is not Rocky.  We liked Rocky Balboa but we never quite like Billy Hope.  But the movie Southpaw punches far above its weight to become a much much better film.
 We start when Billy has the world by the tail.  His beautiful, smart, street wise wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) guides and loves him.  They live in an extravagant mansion with their daughter Leila (played by soon to be very famous child star Oona Laurence).  His agent (well played by new to acting rapper 50 Cent) finds lucrative matches for him.  In short order his wife is dead, he is bankrupt, his manager works for his chief rival and his daughter suffers in the hands of child protective services.  Total, rock bottom downfall and not due to chance or fate but to his own human limitations and terrible deficits.
 Naomie Harris has a small role as a child welfare worker but I could have watcher her for much longer than her few short scenes.  In a greater and much more meaty role Forest Whitaker agrees to train Billy Hope for his comeback fight.  Whitaker cannot make a less than stellar appearance and here he supplies the solidity that holds the film together.
 People often ask me about the decline in American film making.  This hard handed look into the life of Billy Hope is not a trivial movie experience.  Some of the best acting of the year is on display in Southpaw.  The script by first time film writer Kurt Sutter stumbles for me but not until the last few minutes of the film which I thought left us with a flat and unsatisfying ending.
 The direction by Antoine Fuqua however has nary a flaw.  The difficult task of filming boxing match that doesn't recede into boredom or pathos he accomplishes with seeming ease.  Fuqua directed such well received, tense, realistic, gritty films as Training Day, The Equalizer and Olympus has Fallen.
 The three saw blade film would have scored higher as both the acting and direction deserve save for the ending.  We deserved to leave the theater saying Wow instead of It's over?  On a budget of $30 million it took in a solid $16,500,000 over the week end over tough competition.  Southpaw runs for two hours and 3 minutes while holding a hard R rating for violence and language.
 On a somber note we report the sudden death of double Oscar winning composer James Horner.  Horner scored Southpaw and many other famous films including Titanic for which he took the golden gizmo for best score and best song-the now immortal My Heart Will Go On sung by Celine Dion.  He died at the controls of his own airplane on June 22, 2015.",1437868800,,3886,4.57536231884058
7344772,5,B012BPM40U,I loved this movie.  I don't care about all the critic comments.  It ran me thru the gammit of emotions.  It was heart felt and I was worn out at the end.  Loved it!,1437868800,,165,3.764705882352941
7344773,4,B012BPM40U,"Theatrical review.  Spoiler alert!  Like most people who watch a lot of movies, I'm usually quick to criticize one for being unoriginal or worse, full of clichs.  Certainly this film by Antoine Fuqua (""The Equalizer"") with a script by Kurt Sutter (TV's ""Sons of Anarchy"") falls into that category.  Still, I think it's one of the better boxing movies to come along, primarily because of a gritty, determined performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and a beautifully staged ""big fight"" in the final act.

The film opening is a bit unusual.  Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope is already the light heavyweight champion and we are in the middle of a title defense that he eventually wins.  At the same time, he's showing a vulnerability and a careless cockiness that cost him a few too many punches to the face.  Hope was the result of a broken home and was raised in child protective services and foster care.  A positive event to the extent he met his future wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams) who today, with their 7 year old daughter Leila (an eye-opening turn by Oona Laurence), guide Billy through day-to-day life.

Billy is being stalked by Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez, TV's ""The Strain"") who wants a title shot.  At a charity event, Escobar confronts Hope which breaks out into an all-out brawl involving the usual tough-guy posse who accompany the fighters.  A gunshot rings out, everyone panics and Maureen has been fatally wounded.  Up to this point Gyllenhaal plays Billy as an angry vicious fighter in the ring.  It is what motivates him.  His personal life is much different.  He's shy with the press and the public.  He's not confident in routine activities.  He's propped up by Mo and to some extent even Leila.  He had it made.  He was rich and at the top of his game.  Now what?

Billy goes through deep depression, ignores his daughter for the most part, and turns to alcohol.  I know, we've seen it before.  And yes, it goes on a bit too long, even though given Billy's psychological make-up, it doesn't surprise us.  A loss in his next fight and an assault on the referee ends in a suspension and no money.  His promoter, Jordan Mains (50 Cent) bails out on him.  You know, ""nothing personal, it's just business."" Broke and with no job prospects, Leila is taken away from him and worse drifts away when he visits.

Hitting bottom he calls on a former trainer who has his own gym working with underprivileged kids.  Tick Wills is played nicely by Forest Whitaker, who after a series of up and down performances finds the spark again shown in ""The Butler"" and ""The Last King of Scotland."" Tick agrees to work with Billy in order to get a fight against Escobar who is now the champion.  In one of the best choreographed fights I can remember, the ripped actors provide a seemingly authentic battle for 12 rounds.  Fuqua and his cinematographer, Mauro Fiore get in tight for some very cool angles even showing the camera (the viewer) getting punched.

I did have a couple quibbles.  There is a secondary plot involving Hoppy, one of the boys coached by Tick and later Billy, which seems to be just an excuse to give Whitaker a nice scene later in the film.  And I wish McAdams had more time with Gyllenhaal.  She provides a memorable if short performance as Mo.  While this isn't a perfect film by any means, it has the snot, blood, spit and fighting technique that the good ones do.  It eventually has the heart-tugging emotion we know is coming.  And young Ms. Laurence nails her scenes.  Recommended.",1437868800,,3495,4.648692810457517
7344774,4,B012BPM40U,"Beware of spoilers.  I have some things to say about the film, and I don't want to ruin it for you.

I have to start out by saying that Southpaw, though excellent in many ways, reminded me quite a bit of Rocky 3, except I didn't stand up and cheer at the end.  Sometimes you can get away with a weak ending in a novel, but not necessarily the movies.  Those last couple of minutes can often make or break a film's success, no matter how excellent the acting and this film had excellent acting all the way around.

Like other reviewers have said, this is a rags to riches and back to rags, and then back to riches kind of story.  Jake Gyllenhaal's (Gyllenhaal puts in an Oscar-caliber performance) character, Billy Hope, suffers a major tragedy at the beginning of the movie when his lovely wife, played by Rachel McAdams, is accidentally shot while Billy violently confronts a potential fighter who has insulted him and her.

From that point on, Billy's life changes for the worse.  He not only loved his wife, but she also managed him and made the important decisions regarding his fights.  Billy soon loses his house, his wonderful daughter (played by Oona Laurence), his income from the fights, and his license to fight for a year.  He now has to start over from scratch to win back everything he lost.

Billy somehow manages to do this with the help of Tick Willis (played by the great Forest Whitaker), who runs a down-and-out gym on the poorer side of New York City and works with kids to make them better people.

I'm kind of sliding over many of the obstacles that Billy has to overcome to win back the love of his young daughter, who seems to hate him for everything, but most of all, for her being in the care of Social Services.  Billy also has to learn how to fight all over again, learning how to dodge the blows and to finally use his secret weapon--the southpaw.

This movie is excellent in so many way with fabulous acting from the entire cast, great photography and editing, fantastic score, that I'm somewhat stunned I didn't react more positively.

I wanted to.

I saw the trailer for the film and knew this was a movie about heroes who lose everything and then come back to win the day.  I certainly wanted to stand up and cheer at the end, but literally nobody in the audience did that.  I continued to sit in my seat as the end credits rolled and wondered what I'd missed as the other viewers left.

There were definitely tearjerker scenes in the film like when Maureen died, the encounters with Billy's young daughter, the relationship between Tick Willis and Billy, and of course, the ending.

Even the way the film was shot added a tremendous atmosphere to the story.

I think maybe the film was a little too realistic in nature.  For me (and this is just my own opinion) a movie is there to entertain the audience...to help them forget about the realities of life for a couple of hours.  It's okay to make believable films that touch on actual events, or in a sense, reality as we know it.  However, I also want to be entertained.  I find nothing better than rooting for the hero and watching him or her overcome the adversities of life to finally succeed at the end.  I desperately want to stand up and cheer them for their perseverance and belief in themselves.

I just didn't feel that at the end of this film.  Now, Rocky 3, I definitely stood up and cheered.  Rocky is still one of my heroes!",1437782400,,3423,4.440705128205129
7344775,4,B012BPM40U,"I have been anticipating this movie for quite some time. Directed by Antoine Fuqua and backed by the song ""Phenomenal"" by Eminem, here is my review on the movie Southpaw.

Billy Hope is an undefeated boxer who has it all: nice house, nice cars, his wife and his little girl. Billy soon makes the announcement that he's going to retire; but tragedy strikes Billy in the most unspeakable manner after a fight ensues between Billy and rival competitor Miguel Escobar. With the help of his new coach Titus Willis, Billy retrains himself to win: Win back his daughter and win back his life.

Coming off his brilliant performance in last year's Nightcrawler, Jake Gyllenhaal gives another impressive as Billy Hope. I was amazed at how well Jake Gyllenhaal was able to play Billy as a broken man, Billy the father, and Billy the fighter. Something I have noticed as a moviegoer is that Jake Gyllenhaal has a true commanding presence whenever he's on-screen. He embodies all these  different emotions in the character which made him utterly convincing as a boxer. His co-stars Curtis Jackson and Forest Whitaker also reward Southpaw with respectable performances. I especially enjoyed the scenes between Billy Hope and Forest Whitaker's character Titus. And even Rachel McAdams who plays Billy's wife Maureen is wonderful to watch-as is Oona Laurence who is exceptional in her role as their daughter Leila. All in all, Southpaw has terrific performances all around.

Southpaw has a emotionally charged story. As a result, there are quite a few tear jerking moments, but Southpaw's focus on Billy's fight, will, and the relationship with his daughter are what drive the movie. I also like the way the fight scenes were set up; and whenever there is a boxing match in Southpaw, it looks like you are watching an actual fight. With a strong lead performance in Jake Gyllenhaal, a fantastic ensemble in the supporting cast (especially Forest Whitaker), the moving spirit of the story, the strategic fight scenes, and the applauding direction of Antoine Fuqua, Southpaw isn't just a great boxing movie-It's a GREAT movie period. Though it is still relatively early in the year, it will be a shame if the awards snub Jake Gyllenhaal yet again, because his performance is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  And the movie Southpaw is

A Good Experience

7344776,3,B012BPM40U,"In Southpaw, a highly committed and intense lead performance cannot compensate for an uneven, at times even risible screenplay and a general air of the old hat.  A boxing drama so archetypal as to be almost primordial, the story turns on Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), a light-heavyweight champion whose career and lavish lifestyle evaporate in the aftermath of a violent tragedy involving his wife, played briefly by Rachel McAdams.  Impoverished, separated from his daughter (Oona Laurence), and raging against the world, he focuses anew and trains harder than ever to regain his former status.

Every element in Southpaw is ultra-recognizable.  There is the athlete on top of the world who does not respect and control his craft, subsequently falls from grace, and then rises from the ashes, enlightened and enriched.  There is the frequent contrasting of the promoter (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson), avaricious and flashy, with the hard-nosed, soulful trainer (an excellent Forest Whitaker).  There is even an over-the-top antagonist our hero must fight by the end to complete his arc of redemption with a dash of...healing vengeance?  Yes, the wheel is never threatened with reinvention here.  Yet if the performances connect and the writing has integrity and spirit, old-fashioned ingredients such as these can still result in electrifying cinema (as evidenced recently by The Fighter and Warrior).

Here, the acting is of a high qualitythe star's chiseled physique has already awed the media, and his depiction of his character's slow transcendence of inward fury and self-loathing is poignant, if predictablebut the writing is often excruciating.  Note the way explanatory information is crudely shoehorned in via commentator voice-over.  For instance, the audience is told more than once how Hope hails from a Hell's Kitchen orphanage (surely located on the corner of Rags Avenue and Riches Boulevard), and the serendipitous fact his surname is a synonym for aspirational belief sadly does not go unexploited.  In general, Southpaw is plagued by a confusion of purpose, playing as a revenge melodrama trying to be a profound character study; the pulp pleasure of one pursuit is sanded down without achieving the level of authenticity and depth required to satisfy as the other.  In the moment, yes, it entertains and holds one's attention (the fights are exciting and well-shot, if a tad too tidily organized into round-by-round montages), and Gyllenhaal is undoubtedly striking, but the stale core, the sense of a film halfheartedly assembled with mercenary clichs, is a constant distraction.",1437782400,2,2597,5.3669950738916254

7344785,4,B012BPM40U,"I don't know why Jake Gyllanhall hasn't won an Oscar yet. He sure should have been nominated at least for this one. This is a heartfelt film with raw, truthful grittiness to it that doesn't spare the grime,low characters and wrenching tragedy. Gyllenhall's nemesis, the boxer Miguel and his crew, spew clear evil in their performances that make you almost wish Billy Hope would give it to them full bore. But the presence of Hope's daughter is his saving grace, the moral center of the film, and the catalyst for everything good in Billy, and even in the bad guys around him. Billy is close to going over the edge and taking everyone down with him, but love spurs him to change. Forrest Whittaker's character is also well-fleshed out and beautifully done. Whittaker always seems to bring a breathless intensity to his performances and this one is no exception. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because there was just a little something missing...a flatness to it that stemmed from the predictability of the storyline. It's still a great film I highly recommend but I think a little more drama between Billy and Miguel, a little more from his daughter and a longer slide for Billy would have helped. It all happened too fast and I didn't feel the thrill in his final fight. Still gets 4 stars and a recommendation, especially if you like fight movies. And Jake Gyllenhall does not disappoint, as usual. If you like rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you.",1508889600,,1461,4.688715953307393

His performance in this film will make any man turn to the tripod, guaranteed. The story will grab you like Donald Trump grabs the ladies, and it will hurt you like Hillary does anytime she speaks to the black community. There's times where you are going to feel as high as Courtney Love in a hot tub with Larry Flint, and times as low as the American people feel anytime they are told that their vote matters.

7344892,4,B012BPM40U,"This movie is a downer overall except for the ending which brings it back up again.  Definitely not a 'feel good' type of movie, except for the ending.
There is a lot going on with the story line and I don't think it all flowed perfectly.  Specifically when the daughter went from begging to be allowed to stay with him in the court scene to not wanting to even see him the first time he went to visit her.  That was a little odd.  Maybe a scene was deleted during editing, not sure.  Things like that.
I was watching it alone and took a quick break about 3/4 of the way through it and my wife asked how it was so far.  My reaction at that point was 'Meh'.  After the ending I had a more positive view of it.
If you watch a lot of movies I would say it is definitely worth watching.  If you don't then there are probably better choices.",1477180800,,836,4.054878048780488

Just an inspiring movie that makes you want to jump out of your seat and go help someone struggling. Jake did fantastic, Rachel was outstanding, the little girl was a true talent.

7344902,5,B012BPM40U,"So, I am in no way shape or form a fan of boxing movies of any kind (never saw a Rocky or any others) so believe me when I tell you that I loved this movie for many reasons. Jake Gyllenhall is an acting God. I don't think he can do any wrong, but that is just me. This is so much more than a boxing movie, things happen when he loses his temper around a rival for his title. A ton of this movie is him trying to get a new start and custody of his child. This is such a poignant movie that you have to root for this guy even though there are times that you want to shake him out of his own head. There are the standard boxing sequences, 2 I think, and they are even well choreographed and you seem to feel the punches yourself. Bravo to the entire support cast too. Direction and writing are off the charts too.",1474588800,2,810,3.8855421686746987

7344975,4,B012BPM40U,"You've seen it all before--""The Champ"", ""Rocky"", yadda, yadda, yadda. So why four stars? Because of Gyllenhaal's amazing performance. For some unfathomable reason, when a possible Oscar for best actor was being bandied about, several professional reviewers scoffed that transforming one's physique is not a qualification for an acting award. What they failed to mention was how Gyllenhaal also transformed his personality, his attitude, his speech, his character's intellect and growth...need I go on? Totally different characters in every one of his recent film roles such as ""Nightcrawler"", ""Prisoners"", and, OMG--""Love and Other Drugs"". One might object to the violence inherent in many of Gyllenhaal's films of late, but one cannot deny his talent. Also, there is no shortage of excellent performances in the rest of ""Southpaw's"" cast. So purge your mind of previous similar plots and enjoy an exciting and emotional ride. P.S. There is only one extra on the DVD, an interesting though somewhat self-congratulatory 'making of' documentary that lauds everyone's dedication to adhering to the realism of boxing and it's world. No film commentary, which would have been appreciated.",1468540800,,1183,5.5054945054945055

7344977,4,B012BPM40U,"This is not the kind of movie I usually watch.  I saw it on a plane because it looked like the best of a weak group.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting was very good, esp. Gyllenhaal.  His character is, apparently, too stupid to learn to dodge punches in the ring but strong enough to endure them.  Consequently, every match is punishing.  His wife wants him to retire.  The film is about how he falls apart and, ultimately, gets his life together again.  It's about a stupid but physically strong white guy who is manipulated and exploited by black managers and coaches until he finds a black coach who actually teaches him to box (just how could he have been a world champ without knowing how to box?) and helps him form a decent character.  A sub-plot is how a lot of people are without the means or the ability to take charge of their lives and stop being the victims of circumstances.",1468368000,,895,4.441717791411043
7344978,5,B012BPM40U,"Jake Gyllenhaal is like a fine bottle of wine- he gets better with age.  I knew he was something special in ""Donny Darko.""  There are some parallels to the Rocky movies, specifically Rocky IV.  Spectacular performances for everybody here who was perfectly cast.  50 Cent as the ""snake in the grass"" fight promoter and Forest Whitaker ""Tick"" was just perfect to play Billy Hope's trainer.  Jake got in amazing shape for this movie.

His daughter in the film whose real name escapes me, has quite an acting career ahead of herself as well.  This movie will not disappoint.",1468281600,,570,4.755102040816326

7345085,5,B012BPM40U,"My son came over to visit and we had some ""dead time"" to fill and I had Southpaw on my menu screen, a free rental I had received, yet I had two days left on the clock to watch it or lose it, thereby we thought we would watch ""just ten minutes"" of it to get a feel if it was going to be good or not.

  Let me just say we didn't move a lick, and sat in awe until about halfway when the movie makes a big turn to the finish...and much like other reviewers, I agree that this movie deserves to be in the company of the great boxing movies, Raging Bull, Rocky, and the like.  Mr. Jake G is absolutely fantastic as Billy Hope, and the supporting cast around him is right on point.  The daughter character was so believable I would think it's Jake's real kid.  There is a lot going on in this movie but nothing so difficult to absorb, only the way life knocks us all down at some point, the feeling of loss, the moments that define us, courage, tenderness, remorse and regret are all examined throughout this movie and examined by each character within the flick. So, in closing, and without giving anything away, give this movie a shot.  Rent it and then buy it like I did!! An absolute classic in the making.  PS.....Forest Whitaker is not one of my favorites, but in this film he defines the reason boxers fight and he was a great compliment to the overall action......",1460678400,,1366,4.206896551724138

7345089,4,B012BPM40U,"Released in 2015, Southpaw tells the story of a champion boxer (Jake Gyllenhaal) who suffers tragedy and loses everything but his talent, drive and daughter. With the help of a trainer (Forest Whitaker) he seeks to get his crown back, plus revenge. Rachel McAdams plays his wife, Oona Laurence his daughter, 50 Cent his manager and Miguel Gomez his nemesis.

The movie doesnt hide the fact that its a modern amalgam of the Rocky movies, like II, III, V and VI. While the score is by James Horner the soundtrack is by Eminem with two impressive rap/metal songs: ""Kings Never Die"" and ""Phenomenal."" Some people think this limits the films appeal, but it also could be argued that it fits its raw urban tone. On that note, theres fluent cussing so stay away if that turns you off.

Believe it or not, Ive never seen Gyllenhaal in a movie before, although I recognize him, of course. He always struck me as one of those Hollywood pretty boys. I bring this up because nothing could be further from the truth with his role in Southpaw where hes the furthest thing from being a pretty boy. Here, hes thoroughly convincing as a street tough who thinks with his fists and understands little about finance and the business side of boxing.

I was mainly interested in this movie due to McAdams, but her role is relatively small. Nevertheless, the movie pulled me into its story and entertained me for a couple of hours. Beyond that, its a good lesson on humbling thyself and never giving up.

*** MINOR SPOILERS*** Some people complain at how quickly the champion boxer loses his great wealth but, for one, it was a matter of several months, not a couple weeks. Furthermore, His accountant mentions that his funds are being burned through; he obviously had a payroll. Then it is noted that the house is mortgaged, he has zero income because he stopped fighting and his tax return was due. He then takes the HBO deal and in the first fight foolishly assaults the referee, which incurs a huge lawsuit. I would assume his purse would be withheld as a result.

Also consider the fact that Mike Tyson made and lost $300 million. Yes, Mayweather and Pacquiao make gigantic money but look at other champions in other divisions. Unless you're a boxing fan you don't know the earnings of the best cruiserweight or the best bantamweight. While these guys are making good money, its not on the Mayweather level. The movie establishes the character as rich but theres a big difference between $5 million rich and $500 million rich. Plus he wasn't tight with his money. He was buying Rolexes and cars for his buddies, not to mention legal costs; all this stuff piles up. Moreover, its implied that the accountant and manager were taking more than their fair share.

People have made and lost millions and billions in real life, so how is it so implausible for some street tough  who clearly knows next to nothing about the financial world  to lose his wealth in this movie? ***END SPOILERS***

The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in and around the general Pittsburgh, PA, region (Indiana University, Washington and McKeesport), as well as Las Vegas for the final act.

Acting was one of the best I have seen in a long time. You can feel the love between the main characters by just watching the movie. It is an emotional rollercoaster and very well played.

With his life in the balance and his daughter in the system, Billy has to make choices. Will he let his anger control his life or will he step up and face his self-created obstacles and overcome them? I loved the performance  delivered by Oona Laurence as his 6-year-old daughter.

7345259,4,B012BPM40U,"This is a classic tale of a man left with nothing who has to rebuild and not just for himself. It has some different wrappings and more drama, but the performances in this movie cannot be questioned. Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible in his role. And it may sound odd, but watch this movie and then watch another Gyllenhaal thriller Nightcrawler. Seeing these two performance in close proximity show how tremendous an actor he truly is. I digress. Rachael McAdams is all over the publicity for this movie, but her role is not long. But in the short time she is on the screen, her relationship with Gyllenhaal's character is laid out perfectly. It sets up the following events in the film. It explains why his character is so distraught and quite frankly lost. Not a movie I'd watch again and again, but worth at least one viewing. As far as the sports portion of this film, it heavily resides in the final part of the movie. This is some of the better boxing I've seen in a film in a long time.

7345267,1,B012BPM40U,"This movie started with a nice premise. It's so slow. SO slow. And it requires you to suspend a lot of everyday beliefs and common sense. For instance, here is this boxer, who is the light-heavyweight world champion, and has all the belts and all the titles. His record is 44-0. He loses a fight, during which he head-buts a referee. Broke his nose. It's an important point in the plot, but let's look at what happens to this 44-0 world champion as a result of losing a single fight and head-butting a ref:
1) all of his assets are frozen within 24 hours (like...what???)
2) his manager dumps him (of course you dump a 44-0 world champion after 1 loss!!)
3) the media is calling him washed up, and a has-been, and retired (he doesn't retire...this is the most puzzling)
4) his 6 year old daughter suddenly hates him, even screams profane insults at her father, whom she has not seen in a month. Very atypical 6 or 7 year old girl behavior. 6 year old little girls do not act like spurned housewives, but here we get to see one acting just like that.
5) his huge mansion is foreclosed upon and he's forced into the streets.  Literally. Again, within 2 days of his first career loss.  Not enough money for even a roach motel room.
6) literally every single car and stick of property he has is taken away within a day or two of him losing his fight. We see the stereotypical scene where the bankers (why not movers?) are walking around discussing the items...""All of this is going to auction!""  Yea.  Movers move furniture, not bankers.
7) he ends up so penniless, just so broke...it's not possible to believe, frankly. I mean, c'mon now. I really tried...but it was one thing after another insulting my intelligence...World champion boxers with all the belts, and all the light-heavyweight titles, and all the wins,...these guys have a ton of friends, lawyers, accountants and associates. In scenes where he is talking to bankers very soon after his first loss, you're asking yourself, ""This is a multi-millionaire champion boxer with every title and belt. Why is he being asked these questions? Where are his lawyers and accountants??""

...there is more, but I don't want to provide spoilers. In short, I had to stop watching this film after about an hour because it was just too much. None of that happens when you're 44-0 and lose a single fight. I mean, 44 professional fights and he's on the razor's edge of insolvency?? C'mon. He head butts a referee and within a day all of his assets are frozen??? On what planet? Why? Nobody explains...""all your assets are frozen"" is all that is mentioned. We're supposed to just dream up the answer as to why. Anyway, it's just so schmaltzy and trying way too hard. And the entire movie assumes you know so little about boxing that you don't realize that these men are some of the very highest paid athletes in the history of paying athletes. I guess if that's you then this may be a nice movie for you. But it's a boxing movie. I am betting most people who watch it know the minimum about the sport. And for those people, this is a difficult movie to swallow. Oh, and there's hardly any boxing. Lots of slowness. The movie drags.",1455062400,8,3172,4.54816112084063

It was good, and there was enough different in it to make it great. The acting by Forrest Whittaker and Jake Gyllenhaal was top notch. You can see they really got into their characters, so much emotion in this movie. If you loved the Rocky movies I imagine you will love this, that is what got me. If you want some professional boxing documentary go watch one instead of watching this and rating it 1 star. You can tell from the previews what you are getting into.

Probably not, but if you like the genre this is a pretty damn good take about a hot headed counter-puncher who's life falls apart when his wife dies. Gyllenhaal is way good, this might be his best work although I guess he is more known for the gay cowboy stuff. His pain and rage and even his innocence about the harsh realities are entirely convincing and the relationship with his daughter not too cloying. You feel every punch and every beat of his heart. Good support all around, too, and certainly worthy of your attention. I haven't read other reviews but I don't know why this film didn't get more buzz.

Then again this could be due to the story itself. After being taken away by child services from her loving father (gylennhall), she quickly turns cold to him, then hot to him, then cold to him again.

It's not that the acting was over-the-top with drama or memorable characters--but it was some of the realest, most engaging acting I've seen. I think part of that can be attributed to a great script, with a level of subtlety you just don't see in sports movies. The final fight felt like a real sporting event, as I genuinely didn't know who was going to win.

My one criticism:
Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be 43-0. I found this super-distracting throughout the movie as his career and life circumstances seemed completely inconsistent with this fact. Based on the details and the fact that he's a New York fighter, he seemed like a guy who's maybe somewhere around 30-0. Not a big deal, but it threw me off.",1452902400,,785,4.7299270072992705

7345435,4,B012BPM40U,"Boxing dramas are basically all the same and we all know that the main protagonist will struggle, fail, fall but ultimately will win the fight in the end - no matter what.
South Paw is not any different, while it may not be a Rocky - it still is a very well directed film that is engaging from the beginning to the end.
Jake Gyllenhall proves that he can do any role that is given to him- and in Southpaw he has muscled up considerably as Billy Hope who is 43-0 as a boxing champ. He may be a winner in the ring but he has poor control on his temper. His life and his decision maker other half is his wife Maureen- Rachel Adams. She is his rock. They have been around since ages and when she passes because of a melee caused by Hope losing his temper at a charity event. Hopes life starts to unravel and he loses not only his riches but also his daughter who is sent away to child services. So torn apart from the life he knows, Hope gets back to the basics with a jaded but strict coach Forrest Whitaker.
So everything is predictable but it is also very watchable especially the boxing scenes. Release date: July 24th, 2015.",1451692800,,1125,4.188940092165899
7345436,5,B012BPM40U,"Southpaw is a wonderful story of hardships, loss, and redemption. If you're a parent this film really has some moving moments.

7345439,4,B012BPM40U,"The most annoying part of this movie is Rachel McAdams really bad accent.  I normally like her in movies, but she wasn't believable with this role.  The upside is that Jake Gyllenhaal goes all out in this role.  He gives the somewhat typical performance as a punch drunk boxer and that gets a little irritating at times, but it's clear that he put everything he had into this role.  Absolutely believable as a fighter Gyllenhaal had the bulk, the technique and the damaged goods feel down to a T.  You could easily predict each new event in the story arc, but because the action is so good you don't really care.  Take away the great boxing sequences and the plot is a little flat, but from start to finish it was a solid movie with an excellent performance from Gyllenhaal.",1451520000,,774,4.492857142857143

The boxer has to fight to get it back. There are a few exceptions however, such as Cinderella Man. The stakes there were higher, as you were talking about a period of history where people were fighting for survival. With that said, Southpaw was wonderfully acted and directed. My last complaint has to do with the trailer. Can we not give so much away in trailers? I knew exactly what he was going to lose before I ever started this movie.",1450742400,,595,4.570093457943925

7345481,5,B012BPM40U,"The proverbial ""they"" keep comparing this movie to Rocky. Rocky is about the fight. This is about the man. The cover is a little misleading too like this is going to be about some bad relationship. Boy is that far from the truth too. This is more about a man's journey through an epic tragedy that just kept getting worse and worse and worse and his inevitable fall from grace in there.

There is very little happiness in this movie. The only way I can describe it is relentless. But at the same time with the subject at hand should I really expect anything different?

I enjoyed that it wasn't just another fight movie. I enjoyed watching the fights that were in the movie. I didn't enjoy 50 Cent though he was perfectly type cast in the role he was playing. It was very clear he was not up to par with the rest of the actors in this movie though. But thankfully he's in and out.",1449878400,3,880,4.263473053892215

Jake Gyllenhaal provides an outstanding performance. The most striking performances however belong to the young girl actress, the young brother actor. And of course, Mr. Whitaker captured the angst of a surrogate father to Billy's character and the youth who was murdered trying to protect his mother. Nice subtle performances by Mr. Jackson and the ensemble cast. I was skeptical when this flick was released, drawing the inevitable comparisons to other fight movies.

7345670,5,B012BPM40U,"Boxing-Champion 'Billy Hope' (Jake Gyllenhaal) has 43 victories and no defeats behind him, his life seems to be perfect
both inside and outside the 'ring'
At home he has a loving Wife 'Maureen' (Rachel McAdams) and adoring Daughter 'Leila' (Onna Laurence) they have a
lavish life-style as a result of his success in the 'ring'
After a celebration reception 'Billy' gets into a brawl with wannabe Champion 'Miguel Escobar' (Miguel Gomez) during
which disaster strikes following which 'Billy's' life begins to fall apart.
When returning to the ring he has no fight in time his actions when the fight is stopped leads to a 12 month suspension,
no money coming in, he stands to lose everything.
His Manager and best friend 'Jordan Mains' (50 Cent) walks away.....when it seems there us no way back 'Billy' turns to
former fighter and now back-street trainer 'Tick Wills' (Forest Whitaker) in the hope of putting his life back together for
both himself and Daughter 'Leila'.........it'll be a long haul.
This is a gritty and no-nonsense movie which is frequently graphically/brutally violent, however there is a tender and
indeed moving side to the story as 'Billy' try's to win back the trust of those that love him.
'Jake Gyllenhaal' is outstanding in the role of 'Billy Hope' along with great support from 'Forest Whitaker' as 'Tick Wills'
A spellbinding film, not one to miss.....

7345710,3,B012BPM40U,"This Movie was not a typical Gyllenhaal film. It's not bad, but far from compelling or gripping. It follows a baseline safe formula of our hero falling from grace to return and fight back against the adversity of reckless choices. The in your face brute pacing of events seems to hurry you through the story almost leaving you no time to process each scene before it discards it and on to the next bullet point. If you are new to these type of films that try to capture the emotion of sports you may enjoy this film more than I did, besides Gyllenhaals stellar acting as always, this film did very little to separate itself from the mold set by Movies like Rocky. It also references an entire  fighting style based on a fighters natural predisposed stance ""Southpaw stance"" as a sort of secret weapon which was innacurate in the boxing world. Despite its attempt at gripping the audience emotionally it seems to be almost trying to hard to overwhelm the viewers feelings of sorrow for the main character before wrapping up the finale in a lackluster finish.",1448236800,,1057,4.622340425531915

7345724,5,B012BPM40U,"SOUTHPAW is one of the best films about boxing that I have seen in quite some time.  My wife says that the story reminded her of ROCKY III, and there are a few plot similarities.  But, this gritty film is much darker than the ROCKY movies.  Indeed, the tone of director Antoine Fuquas picture is much closer to such classics as BODY AND SOUL (1947) CHAMPION (1949), THE SET-UP (1949) and THE HARDER THEY FALL (1956).

Kurt Sutters screenplay centers on Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal),  a kid from the streets, but now the reigning and undefeated Light Heavyweight  Boxing Champion.  He seems to have it all: money, a palatial home, a loving wife (Rachel McAdams) and daughter (Oona Laurence).

Suddenly, tragedy strikes and Billy loses everything.  Hes back on the streets, and the only chance he has to redeem himself is a revenge match with the fighter whose vile actions brought about the events of his downfall.

SOUTHPAW is a terrific, albeit brutal, film that shines a hot light on the underside of the boxing profession.  The cast, which includes Forest Whitaker, as the retired fighter who trains Billy for his comeback, and Curtis 50 Cent Jackson, who plays Billys double-crossing manager, is uniformly magnificent.

The Blu-ray/DVD/Digital HD combo package from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains may extras: eight deleted scenes,  a Behind the Scenes featurette, a Q&A with cast members and an extended training montage.

Gyllenhaal & Whitaker deliver, but sadly the story is full of expected hackneyed cliches- its Rocky in reverse, and shows its thinness early on. Two lesser actors and the film would have been a disaster. Worth the rental fee, as opposed to buying it? Yes, but its almost like when you plunked down the cash to watch Mayweather vs. Pacquiao on pay-per-view, you were just glad you didn't pay for a seat!",1447459200,,545,4.808510638297872

The best actually acting in the movie was by the girls who played the role of thier daughter.  I was a bit disappointed in the overall quality especially with such good actors.  They made them all very average and down right dumb.  Not all boxers are mindless brainless people.  And even if they were why would you make them that way in a movie.  You could've given it a bit more.  Of everything.  The best part was seeing Jake all muscular.  And the blood and wounds were very creative.  I love special effects makeup. That's why I only gave it three stars.  White a five star cast.,1447372800,,680,4.430894308943089

A boxer down on his life. He comes from a rough beginning, so fighting is all he ever learned. Industry insiders take advantage of his lack of financial sophistication and problem solving skills. He now has to rebuild his life on a different level, different values. He has to control the anger which has driven so many of his wins. Except that in the end, as always, he rebuilds his life by getting back in the ring. Essentially going back to exactly what got him to the lows of his life. It's been done.

Add to this the least realistic fighting scenes since the Rocky franchise, and there really isn't much to enjoy.  Really...that's not an exaggeration.  The protagonist's ""style"" of fighting is to take a whole bunch of punches to the face deliberately over several rounds to psyche himself up and then obliterate his opponent in a red-tinged haze.  Not how real fighting works, and as this is the only plot device besides the leveraging of his daughter, the result really falls short.

It will make you cry, laugh, be riveted, pivot in your seat like a boxer and it will move you. Your time will go by quickly as you become sucked into the drama, the love between Hope and Maureen.

7346070,5,B012BPM40U,The only problem I had with this movie was the list of bad things that the main character had to endure. You begin to believe well nothing else could happen then five more pop up. But having said that it most likely is just what someone in his circumstance would be faced with. All in all it is the best fight movie I have seen in years maybe even the best yet and I watched a lot from Raging Bull to all 35 Rocky installments and many lesser ones in between.  The acting was great. The movies almost always show justice for the hero in one way or another but in real life as in this portrayal you don't often see the kind of justice you think is warranted sometimes  in fact most times the bad guy gets away.  I can't say more without spoiling it for others.,1446768000,,759,4.114864864864865

7346153,2,B012BPM40U,"I have grown to be a fan Jake Gyllenhaal and he has had some really decent movies in the last several years now. I had high hopes for this movie, but as a former aspiring boxer and part time trainer, this movie falls flat in my opinion. I know the boxing game really well, including a lot about the business side, and it was obvious to see what was going to happen (I won't give away any details). The boxing scenes were full of bad technique, and yes, I realize they are actors... but I didn't feel any sense of being captivated by the fighting scenes. There are the obligatory training scenes, and the very cliche trainer with an ailment that sidelined their career. There was some drama about the situation with the wife and daughter, etc... but the movie ends abruptly, without much explanation or offering about what happens in the future of Billy's life. The movie may have been decent if it weren't a boxing movie. Forrest Whitaker was excellent, but outside of that, the movie sucked IMO.",1446508800,,996,4.538888888888889

7346215,4,B012BPM40U,"I would have loved to give this movie 5 stars, but I couldn't bring myself to do it because of a couple, quite noticeable flaws. The actors were absolutely excellent, and the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and McAdams is very natural and easy to believe, but...
I couldn't quite grasp the concept that boxer Billy Hope is a drug addict and has alcohol addiction because the movie never really shows him having a problem with this, or even taking any drugs. I thought he was simply suffering from being beaten too much, until the court scene brought out his addiction problems...it was confusing. Also, he's filthy rich, and very well known in the public spotlight, and yet...there is no footage of any kind of court scene, or real investigation of his wife's death...they seem to just dismiss her completely, which certainly would not be the case in real life. Another thing that bothered me is how his wife died. They are attending a charity event, for children, filled with wealthy and prominent people, yet several people have guns in their possession and his wife ends up getting shot after an argument between the 2 boxers. Wouldn't an event as prestigious as this have had everyone thoroughly searched before they were able to enter the building? That seemed just plain stupid to me, and totally unrealistic. Yet, the movie improved with depicting the rocky relationship between Billy and his daughter, and his ""comeback"", and I found his character to be very real. Jake Gyllenhaal was exceptional in his portrayal, and if I could just critique him....he would get 10 stars!!!!!",1446422400,,1582,4.906716417910448

7346232,3,B012BPM40U,"How many times can this story be told? The answer is like infinite because we see the same sad boxer film with different twists and casts almost every year. SOUTHPAW was written by television series writer Kurt Sutter and directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter, Equalizer, Olympus Has Fallen, etc). The reason the tired story and slow movie holds together is due to the splendid acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams, Forest Whitaker, Oona Laurence and Naomie Harris. Otherwise it is a predictable, slow moving, same old story rehashed.

The story?  As tragedy strikes him in his prime (his beloved wife Maureen  Rachel McAdams  is killed after he has won the title of boxing champion at Madison Square Garden), famed boxer, Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to fall into a great depression. Once the decision regarding the custody of his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) is under question, Billy decides to get his life back on track by getting back into the ring. He turns to trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to help him get his life back on track after losing his wife in a tragic accident and his daughter to child protection services.

The musical score is James Horners last and it is sad that it is so weak. There is some fine cinematography by Mauro Fiore  lots of closes ups of boxers beating each other bloody  and some moody lighting. But in the end  - no surprises, completely predictable, and very slow. The reason for enduing it is the extraordinarily fine acting by Gyllenhaal et al.

7346240,4,B012BPM40U,"Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this film as Billy Hope,a world champion light heavyweight pugilist who undergoes the biggest battle in his life when he faced the most challenging situations in his life that includes the murder of his wife,his daughter was sent to Child Protection Services after she removed from his custody,his boxing manager leaving him and when he lost his first and only fight during his title defense that led to losing all his championships belts - IBF,WBA,WBC and WBO.He tries to fix the mess that his life has been to by seeking the help of a boxing trainer - Tick Willis - to help him get back into the ring in order to recapture all the championship belts that he has lost and make a change for better in order to get his daughter back. We witness him go through the process as he tries to overcome the death of his wife and personal redemption as a world boxing champion.

No question that this movie by director Antoine Fuqua is in the same category of the Rocky genre. It tells a similar story wherein we get to see a pugilist who tries to get back his life on track both on and out of the ring. Despite the fact that Kurt Sutter's screenplay is a predictable and melodramatic,it never falls short of entertainment. Give credit to Jake Gyllenhall's committed and credible performance as Billy Hope as the viewer will definitely behind his character's back emotionally as he undergoes the process. This is probably the biggest reason why it stood out despite the familiar clichs that the story has.",1446336000,,1521,4.633333333333334

7346255,3,B012BPM40U,"Southpaw is one of those movies that tread down familiar territory with its boxing tale.  Having watched some really good boxing movies over the years, I found that this movie really didn't have anything new to bring to the genre.  I won't say that this is a bad movie as Gyllenhaals performance was surprisingly good with his gritty portrayal of Hope.  To me, his performance was the highlight of the movie.  The boxing scenes were also good and well-choreographed.  The issue I have with the movie is that the story relies too much on that same formula as many other of the great boxing movies and doesnt really bring any surprises or anything new to the story with stereotypical characters and a very predictable story and ending.  This isn't a bad movie as Gyllenhaals performance is worth the watch but don't expect any surprises in this formulaic and predictable boxing drama that follows in some familiar footsteps.

7346316,5,B012BPM40U,"I don't normally write movie reviews, but I was inclined to write this one after watching Southpaw last night.

Let me first say that I'm fan of boxing and MMA style fighting. So I initially had interest in seeing it before knowing anything about it.

After watching it, all I can say is that it was an excellent story to it. The characters were fantastic, and who would have guessed the Forest Whitaker would have turned into such an amazing actor and producer. He was just a kid in Blown Away about a hundred years ago and has done nothing but gotten better with each passing year. He also had a small, but great part in what I think was a little known movie called Out of the Furnace.

All in all just a fantastic movie, the effects (it's a fighting movie, and it's fake, so the effects have to be spectacular) were nothing less than incredible.

Between the story, and the ""realism"" of how it was presented, all in all a no brainer as a great way to spend 2 hours of your time.",1446076800,,981,4.286486486486487

7346339,3,B012BPM40U,"Possibly one of the most predictable movies ever made. Its path is laid out bare and clear to even the most naive of viewers almost immediately. It hits on all the key points of a Rocky movie minus the character of Rocky, who had a thousand times the charm of Jake's boxer.

The problem with this movie is Jake G is a fantastic actor who was put into a movie that just couldn't make proper use of his skills.

This is a movie that simply didn't need to be made. It adds nothing to the genre and wasn't particularly interesting, either. Here is an example of some of the silliness--and not a meaningful spoiler--Jake's character is 42 or 43 and 0, stinking rich, with a mansion and exotic cars. Then he goes through a few months of non-fighting, has a meeting with his manager who says he has too many bills to pay, and a few minutes later in the movie he's bumming a ride from a friend and living in a dumpy apartment.

If you want a fantastic recent fighting movie watch Warrior with Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. Amazing, just a great movie.

If you want a fantastic Jake Gyllenhaal movie watch Prisoners. Another great movie, dark but awesome.",1445990400,,1145,4.412322274881516

7346395,3,B012BPM40U,"Southpaw is the story of a man fighting, both in the boxing ring and out, to regain his self-respect and win back the respect of his family.

When we first meet Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) , hes at the top, having just won the light-heavyweight boxing championship. Married to beautiful Maureen (Rachel McAdams, Midnight in Paris, The Vow), with a doting daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence), he lives with his family in a lushly appointed mansion. But Billys circumstances change dramatically after a tragedy throws him into a deep funk that costs him Maureen, Leila, and his home.

In the depths of depression, he persuades gym manager Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to get him back in shape for the big time. The crusty Tick, channeling Burgess Merediths Mickey in Rocky, demands complete obedience to his strict training regimen. But the main plot of Southpaw involves the deteriorating relationship between Billy and Leila and its eventual mending. This process is depicted realistically, not rushed in montage form. We feel that their reconciliation requires as much work from Billy as his fight training. Winning back the love and respect of his daughter becomes Billys highest priority, a first step to reclaiming his role as father.

Directed by Antoine Fuqua (The Equalizer, Training Day), Southpaw is an amalgam of many earlier fight films, particularly Raging Bull and Rocky.
Gyllenhaal does a good job of conveying the constant pain of a fighter, even after winning a bout, as he slowly rises from a bed, hobbles from one room to the next, winces when he moves a certain way. Overall, though, his performance is terribly one-note, as he mutters and mumbles his way through the picture, whether Billys times are good or bleak.

Mr. Whitaker provides a sobering, down-to-earth performance as the trainer turned gym owner whos been there and seen it all. Tick provides the motivation for Billy to get his life back together. Whitaker knows how to underplay a scene for maximum effect rather than showboat.

Ms. McAdams Maureen is figuratively in Billys corner through every fight and understands that the ring is Billys life, not just his source of income. Shes the organizer, planner, businesswoman and soulmate whom Billy completely trusts with his career and future.

Rated R, Southpaw contains extremely authentic, bloody fight sequences filmed from angles familiar to TV viewers of pro boxing matches. Gyllenhaal and Miguel Gomez, who plays Billys opponent in the climactic fight, are precisely choreographed, giving these scenes a raw authenticity.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted scenes, Q & A with cast, making-of featurette, and an extended training montage. A Digital HD copy is included.",1445558400,,2737,5.1647855530474045

7346445,3,B012BPM40U,"Much has been written and said about Jake Gyllenhaal's performance in this movie and if you have heard positive things: it is all true.  Mr. Gyllenhaal has been on a roll lately and his character of Billy Hope in  Antoine Fuqua's 'Southpaw' is another particularly stand out showing.  It's the interesting nuances that he brings to the film is really what you need to see:  down to his slurring speech and lumbering mannerisms he shows that he's not the most intelligent guy in the room and he knows it.  Decisions are better left to other people, in particular his wife played by Rachel McAdams (in a very small  role).  In the movie's best scenes, we actually feel the physical toll of being a boxer, in the morning after the fight he can barely walk.  The movie touches (briefly) on the fact that Billy is at least smart enough to know what he is: not the most skillful or graceful boxer in the ring, but the boxer who can 'stop a punch with his head'.  However, Billy Hope is not only a character trapped by his limitations but also trapped in this overwrought melodrama that is a pastiche of practically every boxing movie you have ever seen paired with the passable, workman-like direction of Mr. Fuqua.  There is never any nuance in Antoine Fuqua's movies: he is as subtle as a sledgehammer.  It really is the actors in this movie (Gyllenhaal,  Oona Laurence and the ever-watchable Forrest Whitaker) that somehow make this watchable.  Audiences love seeing redemption stories set against sports backdrops - it is a trope that almost never fails.  As mass-entertainment goes - this movie goes out of its way to give the audience what it thinks it wants regardless of logic or credibility and it wins on that level, but when you are watching Jake Gyllenhaal's impressive performance you just wish this movie was something more.",1443830400,4,1832,4.720125786163522

Rachel McAdams was gorgeous in this film and they decided to only let her be in 5 minutes of it.  How stupid.  The boxing scenes were not realistic.  He wasn't even a southpaw, it's as if they named the movie that just because it is a cool word.

I had high expectations for this movie and I love Jake Gyllenhaal and he did his best in this movie, it wasn't his fault it didn't work.  The script and storyline was too predictable.  The producers tried to recreate the movie 8 mile but with boxing instead of rap.  I loved the movie 8 mile, and there was something very real about the emotion and rap scenes in 8 mile, but this movie did not have that.  I just wasn't sold on the emotion and the boxing was terrible.

How does Rachel McAdams character die from one gunshot to her stomach?  Why did she die in less than a minute and nobody attempted CPR or covered the gunshot wound?
Why does Jake Gyllenhaal character need to be trained by Forrest Whitaker and taught how to box if he was already the champion? lol
Why does the challenger who is a no name boxer get all the attention and Jake Gyllenhaal who is the champ get treated like the one who is coming up?  makes no sense

Also, the whole drama in the middle of the film with the main character and his daughter is touchingly-boring.  Other than that, the film is flawless.  Jake did a phenomenal job at getting physically fit for the role...unless he was air-brushed by the special effects technicians.  The film has this atmosphere resembling the one from Rocky IV...in both films there is this sort of political/personal rivalry going on between two boxers who will ultimately fight-it-out in the final scene to prove who is the better one.

7346455,3,B012BPM40U,"There's no such thing as an undramatic boxing movie. They're made to be melodramatic, triumph of the human spirit stories that deliver gut-wrenching and affecting body blows. The one-on-one battle in the ring is often secondary to the one-on-one battle with life, and as such boxing movies tend to be extremely formulaic. Why not? They all work, so why switch things up? Antoine Fuqua's long-developing Southpaw definitely doesn't try to switch up its stance; the punches it lands are familiar yet impactful due to the aggressive, committed performance by star Jake Gyllenhaal.

The dedication Gyllenhaal shows goes beyond the ripped physique, which is pretty extraordinary given his skeletal form in Nightcrawler. It's the way he slips and slides around the ring and through life like a seasoned veteran of the squared circle. It's in the droopy-eyed, punch-drunk stare of someone who has taken a few too many shots to the head. Ever seen some of the loopy, mumbling interviews with Mickey Ward or Arturo Gatti (Ward was depicted in The Fighter a few years ago) after their legendary trilogy of brawls? Gyllenhaal clearly has, and combined with a certain street-level braggadocio it makes for a stunningly unique performance. It's important to remember that screenwriter Kurt Sutter (Sons of Anarchy) initially developed this film as a starring role for Eminem, and one can easily see how Southpaw and 8 Mile relate as gritty stories about overcoming one's station in life.

The ironically-named Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the kind of boxer every fan would love. He ""fights in a phone booth""; taking the kind of punishment Rocky Balboa would quiver in fear at, and then unleashes a crushing attack to defeat his opponents. While this style has made Billy popular and extremely rich, it's beginning to take a toll, one that his long-suffering but loyal wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) can no longer abide. Their whip-smart daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) has to come first, although Billy's shady promoter (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) has eyes on a lucrative contract with HBO that would set them for life. So Billy seemingly has it all, including the Light Heavyweight championship; but a violent encounter with an overzealous contender leads to a tragedy that takes it all away. It doesn't take long for Billy to crash and burn in a torrent of alcohol, violence, and suicidal tendencies, until the government swoops in to take the one thing he has left: his daughter. With no family, no friends, no money, and no career, Billy does the only thing he can do by going to train at a neighborhood gym under the Yoda-like guidance of former boxer, Titus ""Tick"" Wills (Forest Whitaker).

What unfolds is a fairly traditional, old school boxing story of redemption, with Billy working his way up from nothing to be a better man than he used to be. Where the film slightly deviates from the normal path is that it also shows Billy's development into a better boxer, one that doesn't need to get pummeled to win. If you guessed that means a series of boxing montages set to an inspiring score then you're right, and while these moments are uplifting there needed to be more to Billy's climb back to the top. However, Sutter's screenplay too often lunges for the emotional knock-out, taking scenes a notch too far. From the daughter's ""I hate you"" attitude which emerges out of nowhere; to an odd scene in which Billy attempts murderous revenge (a scene which includes a pointless cameo by Rita Ora) while in total despair. Characters are established solely for the purpose of having them die later, as there isn't a heartstring that Sutter won't pluck. Does it work? Sure; schmaltz often does. If only there was as much meat to this story as muscle put on by Gyllenhaal.

It's easy to see what drew Fuqua to this project. He makes movies for alpha males, the kind where tough men, silent men overcome back-breaking adversity. Southpaw fits the bill, and Fuqua relishes the chance to shoot the violent in-ring action. He gets up close and personal so that you feel every hook, every uppercut. The final match, in which everything Billy hopes for is on the line, is an epic slugfest that will bring crowds to their feet, but the effect isn't long-lasting.

The word ""southpaw"" isn't simply about being a lefty puncher, although that is the traditional meaning. It also means a boxer who fights with an unexpected style, one that leaves his opponent off-guard. By that definition Southpaw doesn't dare to truly go ""southpaw"", opting instead to go for the easy emotional win.",1439078400,3,4559,4.915584415584416
7346456,4,B012BPM40U,"""Southpaw"" (2015 release; 123 min.) brings the story of Billy Hope (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and his family and entourage. As the movie opens, we see Hope getting taped up for a fight, which we later watch is a successful defense of his Light Heavyweight world championship title. Hope is now 43-0 in his career. His wife Mo (played by Rachel McAdams) begs him to retire while he still can and is on top. We also see how much Hope adores his young daughter Leilah. Then one day, Hope and his wife attend a charity event and Hope is provoked and challenged by Colombian fighter Miguel Escobar, leading to the movie's Pivotal Moment. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from director Antoine Fufua, best known for ""Training Day"", now already almost 15 years ago. Fuqua has brought us a steady supply of 'heavy' movies over the years, and this one is very much in the same vein. This is not meant as a criticism, it's simply what Fuqua knows and does best. Second, it is difficult to say a whole lot about a plot-heavy movie such as this one without revealing too much. At the same time, when the movie's Pivotal Moment is featured prominently in the movie's trailer, why should we bother to restrain ourselves in our reviews? (I thought long and hard about this, and in the end decided not to mention the Pivotal Moment more specifically, so that if you haven't seen the trailer, you will find out for yourself.) Third, I admit had a hard time getting into the movie, in particular in the first hour, but thankfully the second hour (which is in essence ""can Hope get up again?"") more than makes up for it. Fourth, in the end, for me this movie is all about Gyllenhaal's performance. We saw him most recently in a brilliant performance as the creepy TV footage guy in ""Nightcrawler"", and now comes this, an ""out there"" physical performance that you can't help but admire and be impressed by (Gyllenhaal seriously bulked up for this role, and he is more often than not shown without shirt, in particular in the movie's first hour). One cannot but help to think back to Robert de Niro's legendary performance in a similar box-heavy movie called ""Raging Bull"", now exactly 35 years ago. Gyllenhaal is surrounded by other great talent (McAdams looks amazing), but they are all standing in his shadow. Last but not least, the orchestral score is from the amazing James Horner, who recently past away. This is one of his very last soundtracks, and the movie is dedicated ""In memory of our friend James Horner"". There are also a bunch of song placements, including the seemingly inevitable Eminem in movies of this type (""Phenomenon"" and, over the closing credits, ""Kings Never Die"", featuring Gwen Stefani).

I hesitated going to see ""Southpaw"", due to the less than stellar reviews and buzz surrounding this movie. It certainly is not the strongest movie, but I still enjoyed it, in particular for Gyllenhaal's incredible performance. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati a few days ago, was not attended well (3 people including myself). I can't see this sticking around much longer in theaters. If you like boxing-themed movies, or are simply a fan of Gyllenhaal, you will want to check this out, be it in theaters, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1438905600,2,3425,4.716193656093489
7346457,5,B012BPM40U,"I don't care what anybody says about Jake or this movie.  My 23 year old son and myself went to see it at the theater last weekend and it exceeded our expectations, we are still talking about it today.  It's about time they came out with another good boxing movie since Rocky (one that actually has a touching story following)....So many people bash Jake Gyllenhaal but to those that don't notice it, THE MAN CAN ACT.  Jarhead, End of Watch, Nightcrawler, Southpaw, the man can literally transform into any role, he works hard to perfect that role and he succeeds admirably. Rachel McAdams is a gem - always has been.

Non fictional/some fiction, I'd say, The Fighter, was the best. I can easily see a sequel being made for this movie, although there really doesn't need to be one made, as this stands alone. To the people complaining about the cliches, it's a boxing movie made in 2015. Get over it! It's very hard to write around cliches, and still deliver a good, gripping story.",1438560000,3,798,4.707142857142857
7346459,4,B012BPM40U,"From the opening shot, when you see Gyllenhaal's bloody, silently screaming, face right in the camera lens, you know this won't be your normal boxing flick.

Here's the scoop. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a light heavyweight champion boxer. He loves his wife (Rachel McAdams) and daughter (Oona Laurence) to no end. He enjoys all the perks of his success, but when his wife is killed in hotel lobby altercation with a would-be challenger, his life falls apart. He loses everything, including his daughter, and must work his way back to normalcy with the help of a trainer (Forest Whitaker) who is long out of the pro circuit.

This is by no means a new story. Everything here has been seen, in one form or another, in many other movies. What's going on here is exceptional acting, writing and directing. Gyllenhaal, for my dollar, is one of the most important actors working today. His depiction of Billy Hope is about as good as any performance you are likely to see. Whitaker is his usual good self. McAdams does a good job and Oona Laurence is really good. There is a lot of good dialogue and nice touches that raise what could have been pedestrian stuff above to a much higher level.

Now....I like much of Antoine Fuqua's movies. I just think he's got good sensibilities as a director, and he really steps it up here. This is, for my dollar, his best work. The fight scenes are choreographed and directed as well as any I've seen. These guys look like boxers as opposed to actors trying to look like boxers. The camerawork and editing really add that zing to things. Some truly exciting stuff. There is a wide range of music here as well. The late James Horner penned much of it but there was some pretty violent rap included that reminds the viewer how rough a sport boxing is.

This might not be great art, but it as great craft as you're likely to see.",1438560000,,1865,4.541666666666667
7346460,3,B012BPM40U,"Aarghhh! I can't stress enough how much violent sports disgust me. This includes boxing, wrestling, rugby and (American) football. With this in mind, please understand that I sat through 123 minutes of this blood sport so you wouldn't have to...unless of course, you are a fan. Fans must exist, sports like this make pots of money!

So, having said that, let me talk about this particular role. In my opinion, Jake Gyllenhaal must be attracted to movies that are bleak, bloody and (to me) boring, e.g., Donnie Darko, Zodiac, Nightcrawler, and Enemy. He is a fine actor and has been recognized as such in the industry, but he obviously wants an Oscar. Think John Garfield nominated for Body and Soul; Kirk Douglas nominated for Champion; Robert De Niro won for Raging Bull; Sylvester Stallone nominated for Rocky. Director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") might have pulled it off for Gyllenhaal this time.

The cast (the little girl was my favorite):
  * Jake Gyllenhaal (""Brokeback Mountain"") Orphan Billy Hope has come through ""the system"" and has landed on both feet. He is a prize-winning boxer and has all the trappings of wealth and fame. He is NOT very well equipped for a setback.
  * Rachel McAdams (""About Time"") His loving wife Maureen came through the same system with him. She is his rock!
  * Oona Laurence (""Penny Dreadful"") Leila is their adored daughter. She has to develop her own coping skills.
  * 50 Cent (""Last Vegas"") This may be a spoiler, but I came to loathe Jordan Mains. Maybe he was just that convincing, huh?
  * Forest Whitaker (""Two Men in Town"") Tick Wills trained a boxer at his gym who nearly won a bout with Billy; this means Tick is a good coach. His gym is run with NO flexibility. There will be NO profanity, NO striking out in anger, and NO drugs or alcohol. This is a guy I could respect!

As I watched, I was reminded that every toehold to success won by every boxer, is purchased with his or her own blood; unfortunately many of them are surrounded by bloodsuckers!

This is R-rated, so expect profanity, blood, tattoos, blood, sweat, blood, violence and blood. I admire the acting but not the clich-ridden script. By the way, no one enunciates, so if you go to something like this for the dialog, you'd better have top-notch hearing or use closed captions. Just so you know....",1438473600,,2319,4.693827160493827
7346461,5,B012BPM40U,"A fighter only knows one way to work. Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the biggest and best boxer in the world. He controls his world in the ring and his wife (McAdams) controls his world outside the ring. After his temper gets the better of him and his wife is killed Billys life begins to spin out of control. Faced with losing it all he turns to trainer Tick Wills (Whitaker) in hopes of getting his life, and daughter, back. It is very difficult to make a boxing movie and succeed. No matter how good it may be it will inevitably be compared to Rocky and Raging Bull. I have seen a ton of boxing movies and they have all fallen short, not because they were necessarily bad, but because they weren't classics like those were. They both had excitement in the ring and a riveting story out of the ring. This movie had both of those qualities and belongs in the same breath and level as those two. Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance and the story is what keeps you interested rather than when is the next fight going to happen. I could go on and on about this but I will just say watch this. This is one of the best movies of the year and one of, if not the best sports movie in recent memory. I cant recommend this enough. Overall, Southpaw can hold its own against Rocky and Raging Bullthere is no better compliment for a boxing movie. I give this a A+.",1438387200,7,1359,4.271317829457364
7346462,3,B012BPM40U,"Two very good performances by Forest Whitaker and Rachel McAdams, and one phenomenal performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.

I've seen Gyllenhaal turn in some good performances in a number of other movies, but I've never seen him completely submerge himself in a film like he did in this one. While I was watching this film, I had to remind myself from time to time that it was him. He played a boxer like I've never seen a boxer portrayed before. His version of ""punchy"" was muliti-dimensional. When I think of the model for punchy in boxing movies, I think of someone like Anthony Quinn in Requiem for a Heavyweight. His punchy is more along the lines of one dimension.

As for Whitaker, this is the best performance I've ever seen him give; but then, I intentionally did not see the movie that won him the Oscar for playing Idi Amin. (Something like The King of Scotland, or whatever it was called. I had heard that he was great in it, but I didn't think I could get with a biopic that attempted to provide some sort of ""balanced"" portrayal of Idi Amin.)

As for South Paw in general, if it weren't for the quality of the performances, I'd say skip it. It follows the usual boxing-movie trajectory: boxer on top, boxer screws up or runs into some bad luck, boxer on the bottom, boxer gets his head straightened out, boxer gets back into the ring and ends up back on top. But this one has more sappy and/or half-baked, clique-ridden scenes than you'd find in, let's say, three or four Rocky movies put together. But I did like the way the movie was shot: darkly lit, with loads of hand-held camera work and lots of close ups - which helped, somewhat, to make you feel as if you were inside the characters' minds.

In general, I cannot recommend this movie; but I would sit through it again, in a minute, for the three lead performances. The performances were that captivating.",1438041600,,1871,4.510324483775811
7346463,3,B012BPM40U,"Ever since I first saw him in ""October Sky,"" I would be willing to watch just about any movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal (though I draw the line at ""Bubble Boy"").  Here he plays the heavily symbolically named Billy Hope, an orphan from Hell's Kitchen who, through the help of his youthful love Rachel McAdams, precocious daughter (Oona Laurence) and sheer grit and determination, becomes a champion (and extremely wealthy) boxer.  The only trouble is his wife wants him to ease up to ensure he'll still be around and functional in the future.  But when he's taunted by a rival, and he ignores (as usual) the advice to ""just walk away,"" tragedy occurs, and in a span of a few weeks - a timeline that would be amusing if it wasn't presented so grimly, Billy loses not only his wife, but his assets, his sponsorship, his daughter (who is taken into Child Protective Services), and hits rock bottom.  Luckily, Forest Whitaker appears as a mentor and owner of a run-down gym, who also coaches disadvantaged youths.  In another implausible timeline, Billy swallows his pride, trains hard and turns his life back around in about a month and a half.  No clich&eacute; of sports movies is left unmined here, though the entire cast does a fantastic job, making me feel sorry for everyone involved.

The lead actor's performance cannot be faulted, either in the way he's physically transformed himself or the way he manages to convey real emotion even though the plot holds no surprises.  Billy Hope isn't always a likeable character, but I found myself rooting for him anyway, even though I knew exactly how the movie would end.",1437955200,9,1616,4.787769784172662
