4097118,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Having taken prenatal yoga class with Jane through two pregnancies, and also watched/used a half dozen prenatal yoga DVDs, I can honestly attest to Jane's DVD being the best one on the market. Amazingly, Jane has perfectly duplicated her bi-weekly, sold-out San Francisco-based prenatal yoga class on video. She's been teaching prenatal yoga for years and is probably one of the most experienced, knowledgeable instructors in the United States. There's a reason why yoga instructors flock to San Francisco to take Jane's prenatal yoga instructor class. More than anything, Jane has a special, instinctual personality that connects with soon-to-be mamas and babies that you will definitely experience in this DVD. But more importantly, Jane's prenatal yoga practice is especially customized for pregnancy and her DVD makes you feel comfortable so that you can and will actually do prenatal yoga in your home. This DVD a must-buy for pregnant mamas. The proof is also in the pudding...I used one of the positions shown in this DVD during labor to birth my first son naturally.",1318809600,,1074,5.213872832369942
4097119,4,B0039OS2Z4,"The DVD came early & in perfect shape. The content of the yoga dvd is eh.  I'm a yoga newbie & not a fan of the weird hippiness factor to it.  I will say however, I did have aches & pains & this dvd seems to help.",1443484800,,213,3.5106382978723403
4097120,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane does a wonderful job of ""creating space"" for your baby through her prenatal yoga.  The sequence in this video is relaxing, strengthening, and healing for a pregnant body.  I highly recommend!",1438128000,,196,5.09375
4097121,4,B0039OS2Z4,"Keeping up a yoga practice has really helped maintain my physical, mental, and emotional health during pregnancy. I try to do it 5-6 times per week, once in a studio and the rest at home, so finding good DVDs has been really important.

My favorite is Hala Khouri's Radiant Pregnancy, but even the best program can start to feel stale if you do it 4 times a week for months on end, so I ordered 4 others to add to the mix and am reviewing them all here (in order of preference). Jane Austin's Prenatal Yoga is listed 4th but is really tied at 3rd, it depends on whether you want a more challenging or more gentle program.

1. Radiant Pregnancy with Hala Khouri - 5 stars
- Pros: Includes 3 completely distinct programs for each trimester; each program is divided into sections so you can do as much or as little you want each day; Hala provides clear instructions and honest and relaxing dialogue; excellent range of poses, stretches, and movements; one of the few programs that can get my heartbeat pumping while also offering more moderate alternatives if needed; includes Kegel exercises starting in the 2nd trimester.
- Cons: Some poses require props, but I used everyday objects from the around the house (throw pillows, picnic blankets, and a towel instead of a strap) and they worked fine until I decided to go ahead and buy the real deal. Only problematic when I travel.
- In sum: Wonderful program, highly recommended for all levels of experience and fitness, should be a cornerstone of any consistent prenatal practice.

2. Element Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower - 5 stars
- Pros: Clear and concise 30 minute prenatal routine, I can always find time for it; closely resembles a non-prenatal practice in tone and form, but with subtle variations; difficulty is enough to feel productive and strengthened but with well-timed pauses to regroup and recenter; narration is calm and soothing; no props needed; also includes a postnatal program (which I am looking forward to).
- Cons: Not much of a warmup before you begin, so may be better suited to people who are already familiar with yoga; not ideal for days when you have less energy and want something more restorative; only 1 routine so you probably need at least one more program if you plan to continue yoga throughout your pregnancy.
- In sum: Very good all around program for people who practice less frequently or need more than one routine in their practice.

3. Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga and Short Forms with Jennifer More - 4 stars
- Pros: The most challenging program I've found and a true vinyasa flow class, very invigorating and energizing; the full length routine is 1 hour and 15 minutes of constant movement (relaxation follows separately); despite challenging movements, subtle modifications make sure you stay stable and balanced throughout all three trimeters, with a model in each trimester demonstrating the correct variation; also includes a partner yoga routine and a separate DVD of ""short forms"" with 15, 30, and 45 minute routines for when you have less time.
- Cons: Would not make a good choice if you only select one dvd, program is too difficult for days when you have less energy, even the short forms (sometimes you just want stretching warm ups and/or restoratives, neither of which are offered in this program); mediocre production sometimes prevents you from getting a good view of the poses, which can be confusing if you're new to this program or to yoga generally; relaxation consists of 15 minutes of guided shavasana, no other meditation or restoratives, with narration I found more distracting than helpful.
- In sum: Great option for when you want a challenge and completely doable (don't let some of the reviews scare you off, you can always start with the short forms and work your way up to the full routine), would need to supplement with a more well-rounded option like Hala Khouri or Jane Austin for less active days.

4. Jane Austin Prenatal Yoga - 4 stars
- Pros: Upbeat and clear instruction; good emphasis on upper body strength in addition to legs and the pelvic floor; does have chapters (though they're not as clearly segmented as Hala Khouri); feel fully stretched and relaxed by the end.
- Cons: Only 1 routine; moderate difficulty wouldn't be hard enough for me to choose as my only program (still good as an alternate); pace is a somewhat relaxed and the full hour can feel a bit long; only soundtrack is ""om"" chanting which I can tune out most of the time but occasionally becomes distracting.
- In sum: Good program on the more gentle side but still engages the entire body.

5. Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea - 2 stars
- Pros: Honestly hard to think of many, but I suppose if you are really brand new to yoga and nervous about starting, then this incredibly easy program with demonstrations for all 3 trimesters could be a good option for you. You can also buy this as part of Shiva Rea's ""Yoga for Pregnancy"" set which includes a prenatal and postnatal routine, so perhaps you'd get more for your money that way.
- Cons: Really no challenge whatsoever if you've done even a little yoga or are in otherwise decent shape, it's really just 50 minutes of light stretching or holding very easy poses; on top of that, it's a poorly balanced routine, some parts of my body got no attention at all (lower back, calves, abdomen, arms) while others kept repeating the same movements over and over (hips, side waist, and quads); odd use of a chair in some poses when it really wasn't necessary, and they don't offer instruction for how to do the poses without the chair.
- In sum: Skip this unless you are really sure you want to start with the easiest possible program or got it as a gift (in which case who knows, maybe you'll like it).",1431302400,12,5757,4.689416419386745
4097122,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I purchased this video at the start of my 3rd trimester of pregnancy. I have been doing Pilates all through the pregnancy but felt the need to include more stretching when I began having back and hip pain during my 2nd trimester. I am not new to yoga - it's one of my pre-pregnancy exercises of choice, but I have not done any yoga during the earlier part of my pregnancy. This is a great stretching routine (it's not meant to be a hard core workout). It's really done wonders for my back and hip pain, plus I now feel confident that my hips will be adequately ""juicy"" for birthing (per Jane Austen in the video). :)  I will say that the ""ohming"" part is a little comical. My husband laughs when he sees that part.",1430697600,,714,4.25
4097123,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane Austin's prenatal yoga classes were the highlight of my pregnancy and this dvd is a great way to continue your practice from the comfort of your home. I've always been a quasi yogi, dipping in and out of classes when I was looking to create more balance in my life. But never has the yoga mind body connection made more sense to me than when I became pregnant and was introduced to Jane's incredible classes. Her poses really help prepare you for labor and childbirth and she is incredibly knowledgeable about all the changes the pregnant woman's body goes through. She is full of helpful tips to keep your mind and body feeling good during this transitional time. I especially appreciated the emphasis on shoulder work to prepare you for baby holding and the pelvic floor exercises to prepare you for labor. I can't say enough good things about Jane or this dvd. A must have in any pregnancy!",1423008000,,898,4.61875
4097124,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I've used this video about 4 times now. I have always enjoyed yoga but haven't been to a class in years. When I got pregnant I decided it would be good to take it back up. I'm more of a heavy weight lifter than a cardio or class girl, but I like this practice. I get a good stretch and a decent workout in my legs and shoulders. I still have 4 months to go in my pregnancy and plan on continuing to use this video about 4x a week.",1421280000,,430,3.7888888888888888
4097125,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I always prefer physically going to a class over following along with a video. However, when getting to class isn't possible, this is a great great substitute. I've used it three times now and I always feel better when I'm done. Not just in the moments following the practice, but for the next couple days. Not only do I feel better, but it is comforting to know that every time I practice I am preparing my body and mind for birthing my baby.",1418860800,,443,4.349397590361446
4097126,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I am a big fan of Jane Austen and have found what when I'm not able to make it to one of her live classes, this DVD is a great substitute. Her detailed cueing makes me feel like she's actually in the room with me. Now that I'm in my second trimester I have a lot of tightness, aches and pains in my muscles and joints. Jane's routine makes me feel like I'm strengthening my muscles and building endurance, while at the same time stretching and loosening all my sore areas. Doing the DVD before bed has been a life saver for me: I feel completely relaxed and peaceful by the end, the aches and pains I've built up over the day have melted away. I can't recommend this DVD enough. Thanks Jane!",1418342400,,691,4.203007518796992
4097127,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane Austin is an amazing prenatal yoga teacher and her classes are wonderful.  Doing yoga at home, it can be difficult to get motivated and in the right mindset as well as remember the right sequences to do from class.  Her dvd is the perfect at home guide to practicing prenatal yoga with the right intention, goals and safe practice.  It's as if she's in your living room with you, talking you through the practice on both a practical and spiritual level.  The background music really helps clear your head and allows you to focus on being present and in the moment which is also hard to achieve at home, and watching the women in the dvd practice is helpful in making sure you are doing the poses right so you don't hurt yourself or your baby.  I just completed the one hour practice and I feel good and energized!  And it's a rainy day.  Don't sit on the couch!  Do Jane's practice and you will be thankful for her guidance and support.  Thanks, Jane!  You are a wonderful teacher",1418256000,,985,4.4222222222222225
4097128,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane is a true gem.  Her live class and dvd prepared me in ways (i.e. breath and strength) with my first for which I am forever grateful.  Now in my second pregnancy, I again take comfort from Jane's wisdom, humor, and grace.  Whether live or dvd, I cannot recommend Jane's prenatal yoga method enough.",1417478400,,302,4.555555555555555
4097129,5,B0039OS2Z4,Great DVD,1417392000,,9,4.0
4097130,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I have absolutely LOVED having this DVD during my pregnancy. I was super active before getting pregnant (running, Body Pump classes, hiking, etc), but got really sick the first trimester and when I was finally feeling better, found that my usual activities were a no-go for me. I am not a yoga person, but I think the reason is I have never found the right teacher before. Well, Jane's DVD has been wonderful for me. It has kept me mindful and active through my pregnancy, and although it is not strenuous, it is certainly challenging, just in the way I need to be challenged right now. I bought several home exercise DVDs (pilates and Summer Sanders') and find myself returning to Jane's several times per week. I intend to continue my practice for the rest of pregnancy, and highly recommend this DVD to others.",1416873600,,813,4.652777777777778
4097131,5,B0039OS2Z4,Excellent DVD by an amazing yoga instructor.  I am lucky enough to live in Jane's town and take her classes in person.  For those days when I am too busy or need to work long hours this DVD is a lifesaver.  She strikes the right balance between being gentle and providing a workout for your (very) pregnant body.  I appreciate that she treats pregnancy like an amazing gift but isn't too precious about it (sometimes it sucks).  I highly recommend getting the DVD - you'll become addicted to her class and her candor.,1416700800,,517,4.516129032258065
4097132,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane Austin is such a great teacher and mentor. If you're looking to break a major sweat during your pregnancy, this is not the dvd for you. This is yoga, not muscle building, butt toning fitness. Jane teaches you breath, endurance, strength, and mental preparation for birth. The exercises may seem small, but are most definitely mighty. I HIGHLY recommend this dvd to any and every pregnant lady out there, especially to those that are determined to have a happy, healthy, natural birth.",1416614400,,489,4.903614457831325
4097133,1,B0039OS2Z4,"I practised regular yoga prior to pregnancy for several months and still this disk is incomprehensible. Also, I believe whoever the operator is, that person should change their job.",1413676800,,181,5.275862068965517
4097134,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane Austin is a beloved pre- and post-natal yoga teacher in San Francisco - two new moms recommended her class at Yoga Tree immediately upon hearing that I was pregnant. This DVD does a great job of replicating the style of the live class - really emphasizing strengthening and loosening the muscles that will be essential for both labor (positions that work on pelvic muscles) and motherhood (the arm exercises! My husband thought his arms were going to fall off and was shocked to hear we do them even longer in the live class - how will we ever get used to holding a baby for hours?!!!). I'm a beginner yoga student, so the pace of this DVD is just right for me.",1407283200,,666,4.4227642276422765
4097135,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This video is extremely helpful in keeping your body in shape and ready for child birth. The pace is slow, but with purpose. By concentrating on each pose you will build strength, flexibility and confidence for your special day. Jane's approach is thorough. You will feel this work out in every body part. It has also has helped me focus, stay calm and otherwise disconnect from a busy lifestyle. I absolutely recommend Jane Austin's Prenatal Yoga video to help you feel more healthy during your pregnancy and prepared for your delivery. If you happen to live in San Francisco, or plan to visit, consider attending one of Jane's classes, which are phenomenal. Her sense of humor really shines in person making your yoga practice a true joy!",1406246400,,740,4.834645669291339
4097136,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This DVD provides a great prenatal yoga practice with a nice, wide range of poses and relaxation techniques. I like that there is a lot of built in flexibility to the practice to do more or less depending on where you are in your pregnancy and what kind of day you are having (I'm currently I'm my 3rd trimester and let's face it, we all have our ups and downs.) Jane is an excellent teacher and has an incredible instruction style. Not only does she do a great job of incorporating her perspective as a midwife but she also brings warmth and humor to the practice. It's refreshing to not have to take things so seriously (especially when you are pregnant and things seem serious enough)! Lucky to have found Jane during my pregnancy...would recommend this DVD to any expectant mom!",1401148800,,782,4.553191489361702
4097137,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Love the DVD and the instructor.  I've been going to Jane's classes in person, but I am moving.  I'm so happy to be able to take her with me.  It's so important to take the time to relax and stretch when you're pregnant.  This is my second pregnancy, and I believe that doing prenatal yoga greatly attributed to my smooth labor.  I would recommend it to any pregnant lady out there!!",1400630400,,383,4.338028169014085
4097138,1,B0039OS2Z4,If your into more extreme workouts this will be way too easy and BORING for you! I understand you have to take it down a notch but damn!! Def a beginner DVD.

4097139,4,B0039OS2Z4,"I am in my first trimester, so I probably could have used a more intense yoga workout but it was a wonderful way to remind myself I need to slow down a little.  I definitely enjoyed it.

Many of the exercises will be very helpful down the road and even during labor.  This is my 3rd pregnancy, so I can tell this DVD will be my best friend as time moves on.  I wish I could give it a 4.5 out of 5 because it is a little slow for me right now (and I'm pretty out of shape) but it will be amazing for me the last 3-6 months of pregnancy, as well as my natural birth.  I still enjoyed it and need the extra stretch, breathing and relaxation but if you are an experienced yogi this may not be useful until your last trimester. (or 2nd at least)",1393891200,2,740,3.9066666666666667
4097140,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I have never practiced yoga before, but wanted to start now that I am pregnant because I know it can provide many benefits for mother and baby. So I bought three prenatal yoga DVDs, and of them, this one is my favorite. Jane Austin made it very easy to get right into yoga. It wasn't too easy or too hard. This routine had great transitions, and Jane offered modifications if you weren't flexible enough. For a beginner like me, this routine is perfect, and I look forward to turning it on again and again.",1392422400,2,506,4.3936170212765955
4097141,2,B0039OS2Z4,"Exercises are ok.  Commentary makes me cringe.  If you don't mind kissing your hands while imagining it's your unborn baby or the repeated term, ""juicy hips,"" this dvd might be alright for you.",1392163200,,193,4.818181818181818
4097142,5,B0039OS2Z4,I really enjoyed this video when I was pregnant. I would wake up feeling very stiff and this helper to stretch my muscles and relax me.,1384646400,,135,4.230769230769231
4097143,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This is a great video for expecting moms. It was just the right amount of difficulty for any term of pregnancy. It's a video you could use every day if you wanted. I enjoyed Jane's approach to yoga. She was calming and pleasant to listen to during the video. She was good at explaining things. I found some of the poses good for pre-labor practice, also, particularly the hip openers. If you are looking for a (non-annoying!) yoga video, that is a tad challenging (particularly at you get to the 9 month mark), yet relaxing, I would recommend.",1384473600,,543,4.551020408163265
4097144,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I love this DVD.  I'm am in my second trimester and was looking for a prenatal yoga routine that was similar to what my old yoga/Pilates instructor taught.  I love Jane's relaxed, but thorough descriptions of the exercises and it is the right balance of work and relaxation.  I love the meditation at the end.  Who doesn't enjoy a short, but conscious nap.  I always finish feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, but never over worked.  It takes away the stress of work and the physical toll of carrying a baby.  I highly recommend this DVD.  I wish she had others.",1381968000,,561,4.595959595959596
4097145,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I like this prenatal yoga DVD best of the four that I purchased.  It is a one hour long practice.  I practiced yoga for a few years before my pregnancy at least once or twice a week and consider myself at an intermediate level.  As long as you listen to your body and build up stamina before trying to hold the poses for the full amount of time, I don't think you need prior yoga experience to benefit from this DVD.  It is challenging without being too much.  I feel comfortable with Jane's knowledge of what is safe and appropriate practice for pregnant women.  The poses are designed specifically with the needs of pregnant women in mind, stretching and strengthening for your needs throughout pregnancy, and also with labor, delivery, and holding the baby after it's born in mind.",1381795200,,784,4.60431654676259
4097146,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This was an excellent introduction into yoga for me as well as a GREAT way for me to help deal with the aches and pains of pregnancy. Although I haven't delivered yet, I can already tell the strength and openness I'm gaining from doing these workouts with Austin. She's gentle and very good at giving thorough instructions. After I completed the video about 5 times, I felt very comfortable following along with the rest of the women. It's nice to have alternate positions for particularly difficult days, and one of the ladies in the video presents those throughout the workout. I am so glad I got this video. I can tell a definite difference in the stiffness and soreness of my joints when I take a day off from the yoga. So, this is a good thing for me. The video is about an hour long, but you can choose certain chapters that you feel you need most for the day. Typically, I'll do about 40 minutes a day and always include the warm up breathing exercises because I feel those fuel the entire workout. If I skip that, I have much more difficulty through the rest of the workout.
The only regret I have with this was that I wish Austin had more than one video!",1380153600,,1163,4.364055299539171
4097147,3,B0039OS2Z4,"The Prenatal workout is fine. I did Bikram and Vinyasa for years with teachers and from DVD's, and this is on par with what I would expect for a home yoga DVD. But, I actually had to step away and DELAY starting my workout to express the frustration I feel each time I load this DVD into my bluray DVD player--it does not work correctly! I always have to stop/start/restart/stop/start in order to make it play. And, then it only plays from the intro, so I forward to the workout. Basically, in my bluray the menu does not function (and my computer and other DVD player are located in too small a space to do this workout). So, that's annoying.

Also, as a professional television producer, I would have to say the production value of this video is poor. The editing and shot selection is not use-friendly or edited to maximize the instructional format. For example, when doing poses that you may not be familiar with the video focuses on Jane Austin who is talking but NOT doing the pose! Why would you do that?! when there are likely many woman out there like myself who are looking up at the screen at that very moment to make sure they're doing the pose correctly--but then we have NO visual reference point for the pose. Whoever edited this video clearly does not understand the point of a fitness video and that you have to cut to the action during instruction!

Other than these two things that seriously bug me--which I think are a pretty big deal, i.e. technical and production value, the DVD is okay. I am 5.25 months pregnant and I've been doing it once a week since 4 months. But, it's mostly because I cannot go to Jane's class which is hard for me to get to most times. Jane is a pretty decent teacher, and I'm pretty sure we used to live in the same neighborhood in SF, so I would love to go to the class in person. This DVD is just a substitute for Jane and the class--and a just adequate substitute at that (I'm sicking of fighting with my player remote).

Jane if you ever want to make another video, feel free to hire me and my production friends. We'll make sure it's done right!",1378944000,,2098,4.374358974358974

4097150,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I'm lucky enough to live in San Francisco and can therefore attend Jane's classes live -- they are always packed with 30-50 lovely pregnant women per class.  But when I can't get to class, I'll pop in the DVD.

WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HER DVD:  Her DVD is very similar to her classes: gentle but with good strengthening and specific pregnancy stretches for the back, trunk and hips.  I especially love the hands-knees work (helping baby move into the optimal birthing position) and the shoulder work (to help prep mommas to hold their babes.  <--I love that she calls the little ones ""babes"" btw).  I like that she focuses on breathing and centering -- something we all will need to hone in on when dealing with the new challenging experience of crying babies and lack of sleep.  And mostly, I love her down to earth and fun attitude.  It's not too ""yoga-y"" if you get my drift.

MY CREDS:  I'm a physical therapist, certified Pilates instructor, former professional ballet dancer and have done all kinds of yoga:  vinyasa, hatha, hot yoga, bikram, yin (my least fav), power yoga, restorative etc.  I've taken classes in SF, NY and 3 months in Bali (what a treat!).

MY EXPERIENCE:  I was pretty sedentary in my first trimester due to nausea and so by the time I decided to try yoga, I wasn't in the best shape.  I found prenatal yoga to be a good challenge.  I used to love doing lots of slow controlled chatarungas, one legged balance poses, upside down stuff was the best!  By the time I started prenatal yoga, I couldn't even really hold a modified hands-knees plank without feeling strain on my abs.  If you are still in uber good shape (e.g. running, regular yoga, etc) then you may not need to transition to the lighter prenatal yoga quite yet.  But as you get larger, more swollen, and if you experience pain in the low back, hips, or pubic bone (ugh my nemesis!!), the prenatal yoga becomes just a lovely treat.

The great thing about yoga is that you can always modify -- if it's too easy you can do more chatarungas.  If it's too challenging, you can simplify the pose or take a resting pose like child's pose.  An example modification is when a wide legged, turned out stance increases pubic bone pain, you would keep your hips and feet square in a neutral position and hold the pose there while doing trunk twists or arms.

Overall, a fantastic addition to your prenatal prep!",1367020800,3,2383,4.542253521126761

4097152,4,B0039OS2Z4,"I am 3 months post partum with my 4th child.  I used this dvd 3x/wk throughout my 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  I have done prenatal yoga classes with a previous pregnancy but I have not used any other dvd so I don't have a whole lot to compare this one to.  But I can say it felt wonderful on my aches and pains and did a great job keeping my hips loose.  I have no doubts yoga contributed greatly to a fast, easy labor.
Pros of this dvd for me were:  an enjoyable sequence that was not particularly challenging in the 2nd tri but became increasingly challenging as I got bigger in the 3rd.  I always felt relaxed and loosened afterward.  I still use it and it still feels great to do.  Much of the time is spend sitting but it is easily modified to be done standing should you want to do it after birth but can't do much sitting comfortably.  I also appreciated that the majority of the dvd was not particularly spiritual in nature.  I look to yoga for the wonderful physical benefits.  I have other means of spiritual development so I don't enjoy it when instructors include a lot of that.  There is some spiritual stuff at the very beginning and the very end so it was easy for me to skip those parts.  Finally, (on a side note) I liked that the instructor and mommas were all modestly dressed.  I don't like watching barely dressed people.
Cons:  It is an hr long so it made it challenging to get done with 3 other kids.  I am now back on amazon looking for a shorter dvd to continue practicing.  I haven't used this one as much post partum simply because it is just too long to get done on a regular basis with a newborn.  Other reviewers have mentioned that the instructor talks non-stop and it is true.  Oh my!  Truly.  Non. Stop.  I didn't mind so much since I use yoga for exercise and not for quiet meditation but it did get annoying after a while.  If you are looking for quiet don't choose this dvd.
Overall I gave it 4 stars because the cons were annoying but not major problems for me and I got so many wonderful physical benefits from it that I would most definitely use it again if I ever have another child.",1365379200,2,2120,4.218905472636816
4097153,5,B0039OS2Z4,"jane's dvd was a godsend. at 34 weeks pregnant, i found myself in the hospital on bedrest, scheduled for a c-section 2 weeks later. (goodbye home birth!) thank goodness i had jane's dvd to continue my practice. (i was taking her class weekly and loved it so much i'd already bought the dvd.) there's nothing like 2 weeks in a hospital room to make you stir-crazy, so i made jane's dvd part of every morning. despite the shift in my circumstance, thanks to the dvd my yoga practice continued to deepen and i continued to feel strong. the poses flow gently from one to the next, are gentle but strengthening, and jane's wit and gentle humor are the perfect commentary. most importantly, jane uses each pose as a metaphor for birthing and motherhood, inspiring focus and attention on the baby within.

jane's yoga helped me transform a difficult situation into a wonderful, meditative, and spirited experience. my daughter is now happy and thriving, and i'm quite sure jane's yoga had something to do with that.",1364947200,,1008,4.76

Jane takes the time to talk you through all the movements so you can feel as comfortable as possible. She gives different options depending on how much yoga practice you've had before and depending on those pains and aches that might plague you during pregnancy.

Doing it regularly I've been able to avoid almost any hip and back pain my whole pregnancy. When I go a couple days without the poses from this video I can really tell a difference in my quality of sleep and tightness in my hips in back the next morning. Even when I don't have time for the full video just making sure to incorporate some of the hip movements and side bending she does in the video makes a huge difference in how I feel the next day.,1363392000,,548,4.036697247706422

She knows how to give just the right sequence of poses to help women build strength and stamina as well as de-stress and connect to their babies.  Jane's passion for teaching pregnant women and her background as a midwife and doula put me right at ease.  You will feel empowered by this practice!!!",1362096000,,513,4.677777777777778

I feel both stronger and more flexible - what could be better and make me more ready for giving birth and bringing my little one home? I work a lot and the DVD has been an absolute lifesaver in terms of keeping my stress levels down and keeping me connected to my baby even when work gets crazy. If you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or looking for a great gift for a soon-to-be-mom, nothing could be better than this DVD.

4097160,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane Austin is an amazing teacher.  I am not new to yoga, but this is my first pregnancy. As a first pregnancy overachiever, I have done the research & Jane is my favorite. Jane's guidance and advice through the poses of pregnancy comes from a deep well of experience.  My favorites are the juicy hips, where you increase the flexibility and range of motion of your hips, and the arm strengthening exercises.  At first I thought they were simple, but yoga can be very simple - it's about the intention (as I badly paraphrase Jane).  Now as I am becoming more and more pregnant, I am realizing that maintaining the practice and pushing myself for excellence within a ""simple"" pose creates the endurance necessary for life's strenuous moments (ahem, like childbirth!) The juicy hips and the arms are also useful especially since I work a desk job, and I plan on keeping that series in my private practice.  Jane is seriously spiritual, but retains a sense of humor and a practicality that I find refreshing.  I love the OM, and my baby loves to hear my voice.  Thank you Jane, for this great video.",1360281600,,1096,4.618556701030927
4097161,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Posting from my hubby's account:

This dvd is great. I recommend it for the newbie, casual, and moderate yoga practitioner (assuming you are pregnant). Experts may find it a little lacking in intensity/difficulty. To be clear, this workout is not going to ""kick your butt."" Rather, it is going to loosen your hips, get you in a good mindset, stretch out your body, and work some crucial areas that are important for a healthy natural birth. What's not to like about that? If you are pregnant and interested in getting your body ready for birth, you can't go wrong with this DVD.",1358726400,,578,4.666666666666667
4097162,4,B0039OS2Z4,"I am used to doing bikram yoga (90 minutes, heated), so this was a big change from what I am used to. If you are looking to yoga for a solid workout, this yoga will most likely not meet your needs. However, if you are looking to yoga as a source of relaxation and stretching, or if you are simply curious and want to start with a gentle yoga, this is a great resource! (Also, if you're like me, and struggling to have the desire to work out while pregnant, this is helpful for getting back in the saddle!)

I am not a fan of the ""om"" chanting and new age qualities that are inherent to yoga, and some of that IS present in this video (e.g. the background track), however, I liked it anyway. If you know you can't stand that, then, again, skip this one. I didn't mind it because the mindfulness is about your baby, and that appealed to me :)

I ordered a lot of other DVDs for maintaining fitness and while this one was gentler than I was looking for, I am going to keep it in my rotation anyway. I may update my review after I've done it more regularly.

The quality of the video is top-notch. Jane Austin is a great instructor and the modified poses are front and center and easy to follow. Note that you'll want to have a heavier blanket to sit on and perhaps a firm cushion for support in some of the poses (I just used some items I had around my house).

Again, a great yoga video, but if you're looking to get your heart rate up, this is probably not the one for you.

p.s.

I really trust Jane's guidance as someone who has delivered her fair share of babies and can balance the science with the exercises.

4097167,2,B0039OS2Z4,"I really wanted to like this dvd, but was very disappointed.  First, it's not much of a workout.  I'm 27 weeks along and run 3-4 times a week.  I also do strength training or yoga twice a week.  For me, working out keeps me feeling normal in a time when my body and emotions are changing everyday.  I was hoping this would be something to relax and ease stress, while also making me feel like I'm strengthening my muscles.  That is not the case.  The first 30 minutes is hard to get through, with things like finger and hand massages, meditation time, and poses modified to the point of not being felt at all.  The second half is better, with standing poses where I actually felt something.  Second, I feel like this was a little too fluffy for me, with too much focus on visualizing your baby and sending messages to your baby.  I do feel like these are good things to do, on my own time or in moderation during a workout.  But, it was just too much.  Lastly, for some reason, it was just hard for me to take this dvd seriously.  I almost felt like it wasn't really about the practice of yoga.  On a positive note, she does a bunch of hip exercises and poses.  I'm hoping that will help my recent nighttime hip pain.  I'm considering trying to return this or sell it, which is something I don't do often with workout dvds.  If I keep it, I'll use it for light days or very late in the pregnancy.",1351555200,5,1396,4.2272727272727275

Her video is designed to be used throughout pregnancy so even a full term pregnant woman, can move, invigorate and connect with her body.  The beauty of this DVD and what makes it different from others is the connection she holds with the childbirth process on a physical level and, perhaps, even the coming into Motherhood on an energetic one.",1350518400,,644,4.836363636363636

As a PT specializing in the pregnant and post-birth community, I recommend this DVD to many of my clients.  Jane focuses on the key body areas to open, engage, strengthen, and soften; but she also taps into the important spiritual element of connecting with oneself and with the baby.  This element is often forgotten in the hustle and bustle of pregnancy.  Preparation for birth is a profound and multi-faceted process...from the logistics of shopping for diapers, cribs, strollers, etc, to juggling work, dealing with financial concerns (and often with lack of time & sleep)...and all the many things women go through while pregnant, this DVD offers some important ""me"" time.

Jane gives variations depending on how you are feeling that day- she doesn't just break the poses down by trimester, stressing the importance of staying connected to your body throughout the practice as well as pregnancy. As I said, the poses can be challenging, which allows the practitioner to find her breath and therefore find a way to stay in the pose if they are able; obviously taking a break can be just as important.

I feel that anyone who follows this DVD and is looking for a connection to their body and baby will be happy with what they find here. This is not a ""workout"" DVD, so don't expect to sweat it out, but do expect to strengthen, stretch and tone your body, preparing it for labor, delivery, birth and motherhood.",1346716800,5,970,4.542857142857143

I love yoga for the opportunity to focus internally and physically, to stretch and strengthen.  Prenatal yoga at first seemed a bit slow and basic to me, but the stretches and poses that Jane walks us into are SO refreshing, opening and nourishing to the tired and cramped muscles around the torso, the hips, the lower back (sacrum) and the upper back.  Our mama bodies go through a lot of hormonal and physical changes to carry our babes!  And they require a lot of pelvic floor strengthening and opening to easier birth our little ones.

Jane's approach is knowledgeable and caring. The phrases another reviewer referred to as ""corny"" are the exact ones that I hear laboring women repeat to themselves over and over, becoming a comforting mantra and reminding them of useful action.

The video encourages women to connect with themselves and their babies - and that union is the true definition of yoga.

Comparing my first and second pregnancies, it was my personal experience that having a Yoga practice made all the difference in the world as to how I felt physically and emotionally. The birthing process itself was much easier for me as well, having a Yoga practice. Specific exercises for the hips and pelvic floor are very useful for the birthing process. I did lots of juicy hip circles while in labor. If you can not attend her class, this DVD is the next best thing. This prenatal practice is a gentle, complete Yoga class designed for self care of the pregnant mother, addressing  her mind, body and spirit, connecting with the child she is carrying.

It is broken up into chapters (although none of the chapters can be effectively used as free-standing work-outs) and all together, it is about 60 minutes but feels like an eternity. It doesn't give you much of a work-out and doesn't really offer much in the form of stretching either.

The instructor says corny things like ""we like juicy hips"" as she is swiveling her hips. I felt like there was very little actual yoga poses incorporated into the dvd except Warrior II. Other than that, I wouldn't consider this a ""yoga"" dvd.

It was too distracting and didn't let me get into that connected centered 'yoga' mind state.  On the contrary, in Jane's practice, every single asana and move is safe and beneficial for moms-to-be. During her many years working with hundreds of pregnant ladies, Jane tried and tested what works best.  Those crazy arm exercises?  You bet I thanked the stars (and Jane :)) for them once I had to hold my baby what for seemed like most of the day.

Jane begins with a centering meditation that connects you to your own breath and your baby, and moves you through a practice that is comfortable but invigorating and strengthening for mamas-to-be.  Unlike other prenatal yoga videos I've tried, Jane's practice is down-to-earth and real, and doesn't distract from the practice with annoying, unnecessary chatter or lame jokes.  Jane's cues are right on point, she knows exactly when to remind you to release your jaw and relax.  She gently reminds you how to adjust your posture so that you're working with, not against, your body and your breath.

I'm 3 weeks away from my due date now, and feel great - both stronger and more mentally prepared for birth because this video.

The routine is engaging and feels fresh even after a lot of repetition. I used the Shiva Rea video during my first pregnancy, but I've liked and used Jane Austin's dvd a whole lot more. In fact, I've only done the Shiva Rea dvd once during this second pregnancy. Jane makes yoga down-to-earth and fun. She has a great sense of humor and her words are heartfelt. Plus it's a good mix of relaxation, stretching and strength building poses. You can easily challenge yourself or dial it back if you're wiped out.

4097188,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I am pretty inflexible and a complete beginner when it comes to yoga, but tried this DVD out of desperation when severe back and pelvic pain became almost debilitating in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.  I am pretty active, but my back pain had become so severe in the last month that a walk around the block would leave me being barely able to stand up long enough to make dinner afterward.  My doctor was on the brink of sending me to physical therapy, and now after finding and practicing Jane's yoga routine I am so much better.  I noticed a gentle easement in my back pain the very next day after going through the routine for the first time, and now having done it regularly for a month, can honestly say it has made all the difference.  Jane is very easy to follow, and she gives different variations based on your level of flexibility and comfort in the poses.  You'll find that over time, you are slowly gaining more flexibility to go a bit deeper in the poses, but you never feel pushed beyond your comfort level.  The trick is to do the yoga routine every other day to maintain the stretch and relaxation your back and round ligament muscles need to have to help them bear the weight of your growing baby.  Your back almost hums with happiness and relaxation once you're finished.  I wish Jane had more yoga DVDs to try, as she has inspired me to try to incorporate the practice more regularly into my life even after the baby is born.  However, this one appears to be it.  I'm not too keen on the more voodoo spiritual side of yoga, and if you feel the same way, I suggest you just skip the first 4-5 minutes of the DVD where the ladies are finding their ""inner ohm.""  If you're struggling with very bad back and ligament pain during your pregnancy, try the routine on this DVD a few times before you do anything else -- it makes such a difference!",1334016000,15,1860,4.36231884057971
4097189,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This is a FANTASTIC yoga DVD!  I am so lucky to have found Jane's classes here in the Bay Area, but even though I could go to her classes in person, I still appreciate having her DVD.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow, so you don't spend a lot of time with your neck in a weird position trying to see what's going on.  I feel so much more relaxed, refreshed and composed after doing this DVD.  I wish I had known about Jane's classes and DVD when I was pregnant with my first daughter!  I think the practice would have made for a more peaceful birth experience.  As a bonus, my two-year-old likes to do the DVD with me. :) Enjoy!",1334016000,,642,4.137096774193548
4097190,5,B0039OS2Z4,I'm so glad I purchased this DVD! It's a wonderful way to practice prenatal yoga in the comfort of your own home. I love Jane Austin's humor and warmth as it makes the time fly by quickly while I'm engaged in my yoga practice. She is a great instructor and I especially appreciate having the women in the video use different adjustments and props for suggestions on how to modify some of the poses. I feel at peace both mentally and physically after I complete this DVD. It's a wonderful panacea for the many aches and pains of pregnancy. Highly recommended!,1334016000,,558,4.534653465346534
4097191,5,B0039OS2Z4,"Jane Austin is renowned as a prenatal yoga practitioner and this DVD really shows why.  She has an amazing knowledge of the bodies of pregnant women.  This DVD has been extremely helpful for the various hip and back pains that I have had throughout my pregnancy, as well as being calming and centering.  I'm a complete yoga beginner, and it's been easy enough for me to follow.  I highly recommend it for any looking to add yoga to their prenatal practice.",1330387200,19,456,4.592592592592593
4097192,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I am fortunate enough to live in San Francisco where Jane teaches pre-natal yoga and I love her classes. This DVD is a great way to get your body strong, supple and stretchy for labor and motherhood. One of my favorite things she teaches is ""Juicy Hips."" The shoulder strengthening work is just that; don't skip it. As you do it more it gets easier, your shoulders get stronger as does your inward concentration. If you are looking for a super solid prenatal yoga practice this video is all you need, just be gentle on yourself and do what feels good.",1329868800,,551,4.465346534653466
4097193,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This pre-natal DVD is wonderful. Jane has a very intuitive sense of the Pregnant Mama's Body and how to prepare it both mentally and physically for the process of birth. She focuses on the breath and many fundamental poses that can be used to strengthen and ready the body before labor and during both labor and delivery. I was fortunate enough to  attend Jane's prenatal classes during my first pregnancy but due to having moved away and the busyness of a toddler running around have not been able to make it to prenatal classes in this pregnancy; this DVD is the perfect option. I always feel more open throughout my shoulders, back, and hips and more centered and relaxed after practicing with it. Jane has that special ability to be both calming and grounding while at the same time infusing the practice with humor and wisdom.",1328918400,,831,4.691780821917808
4097194,5,B0039OS2Z4,"While being lucky enough to have Jane teaching in my area this DVD still gets good use. Being a mother already, my schedule is tight and this DVD is my first choice of a bunch when I have the time to take care of myself AND my growing baby. If it's carving out time to do the whole thing or, as Jane herself reminded me, just taking a few minutes to do one section, the after-effects are so worth it. Just keeping the memory of how you feel after as a motivation to do it on a regular basis is all you need. Jane covers it all in this program with, as has been already been said, a lightness and humor along with a sincerity and deep knowledge of this complex and highly variable time in a woman's life. As a past midwife, doula, birth prep teacher etc etc the list goes on, she is highly qualified to design, break it down and pack a great sequence into the shortest amount of time so that us mamas get the best results and experience. Short of being able to go to one of her classes in the flesh, this is the next best thing. The DVD is stylish, well produced, succinct and a great companion to the incredible journey of becoming a mama! The shoulder strengtheners will stay with me FOREVER!!",1328400000,,1194,4.195652173913044
4097195,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This DVD was and is amazing! I got this DVD from Jane and she wrote a sticky not on it saying..... Tai.... Do this 3 times a week! I giggled because I was still working full-time at 7 months pregnant. The last thing I wanted to do was work out, but once I did this once I fell in love! I hate calling it a workout because it was much more. It was a little challenging at first because I never did yoga ever in my life. But being restricted and not able to run like I used to I just wanted my breath and energy back. I felt stuck in my body. I did the workout once and it was addicting. I did it everyday! A few weeks in I did some moves throughout the day to just regroup. Since I had a Homebirth, I really felt like I needed to be prepared and one with my body and baby. This was the ticket. It was simple, different levels of difficulty explained which was nice, calming, and strengthening. Honestly janes.... ""move those juicy hips"" stuck and got me through some of the toughest times of my labor. All of her moves she does in this video helped me become ready and a good mommy. I wasn't afraid of my labor after doing her workout. and I even had strong arms for after the birth to hold my baby for long periods of time. Even up till now 10 months later. I felt so at peace and fulfilled after. I didn't have the need to want to gasp for air, I slept better at night, my aches and pains went away..... All because of her precise moves for pregnant women. Every stretch and hold was spot on to targeting my body's needs. Yesterday I still did some of her moves to just bring my mind and body back to one. Thanks Jane! Best yoga session ever!",1328227200,,1643,4.042944785276074
4097196,5,B0039OS2Z4,"EVERY pregnant woman needs a little Jane in her life!  I was pretty active during my pregnancy and while I'd never been a big yogi, I knew I needed to balance the cardio with some good stretching to keep those aches and pains away.  This DVD became a regular go-to for me, particularly during my 3rd trimester when I was slowing down and really needing to work out particular parts of my growing body.  Not only did I HUGELY benefit from the increased strength and flexibility practiced with Jane, (I managed to push out my 10 lb. 5 oz baby boy at home with no drugs!) I also learned the necessary body awareness, patience and surrender it would take to feel empowered during birth and as a new mother.  Jane offers incredible insight into the physical, emotional and spiritual journey that is pregnancy and motherhood... all with a lightness, gentleness and wonderful sense of humor!  After my son was born, I sent my DVD copy to a very pregnant friend who recently told me she was doing Jane's workout 3-4 times a week and that ""it works all the right spots!"".  Get this for yourself or the mamas-to-be in your life... you won't regret it.",1319673600,,1141,4.541463414634146
4097197,5,B0039OS2Z4,"I loved using this DVD while I was pregnant, and even after I gave birth. Jane Austin's teaching style is a wonderful mix of calming presence and lighthearted, energetic challenge. I had a lot of hip and pelvic pain and achiness during pregnancy, and Jane's ""juicy hips"" movements helped SO MUCH. I started doing them every morning and evening, even if I didn't have a chance to do the full DVD. Even now, if I wear my 3-month-old son a lot during the day I'll have some hip pain, so I continue to use ""juicy hips"" to stretch and loosen things up to prevent a serious injury. Definitely recommend this DVD (and Jane's birth prep class if you're in the Bay Area)!",1318982400,,662,4.434426229508197
4097198,5,B0039OS2Z4,"This is the best prenatal yoga DVD I have tried so far.
Jane leads the class in a very nice and appropriate temp for pregnant ladies.
I love the poses she gives in this video, very important and very useful.
She gives very good detailed explanations that helped me to understand the reason and therapeutics of each pose. I will definitely recommend this DVD to every pregnant woman.
It is great to have it on hand to practice prenatal yoga anytime during the day.",1318896000,,463,4.523809523809524

8392211,3,B0039OS2Z4,"I'm not a yoga person, but I picked this up hoping that it would help me through pregnancy. The content is super helpful, but the delivery drives me nuts. Heh. Delivery. Anyways, I'm sure this is great for people who are into soft, ethereal speak, but that's just not me. The poses really do help with stretching and  making my body feel good, so I'll use the dvd until I learn them then practice on my own.",1496016000,2,407,4.285714285714286

I really love restorative yoga and slower practices. Most of the videos online did not take time to work into poses the way this one does. I still add in some of my own warm up stretching but overall love it.

And I can't have a baby now without thinking about her ""juicy hips"" comment!",1456704000,,525,4.188118811881188
