8740440,4,B017S0FSBU,"Surprisingly strong and intelligent WWII film, especially given its terribly misleading packaging, which makes it look like a cheapie war/horror film. But instead, this is a stylish (especially given its tiny budget), generally well acted and original view of the horrors and absurdities of war.

While not every element worked for me (the super brief, almost hallucinatory flashbacks of home started to grate after a while), theres so much thats original here -- from the fact the two main characters are deserters, not 'heroes', to the army of child soldiers they team up with (and prompt questions as to whether these handicapped kids are heroes or victims of exploitation or both), this film dares to ask important questions and is told with unique perspectives. Well worth seeing for its originality and style on a shoestring.

The blu-ray is a BR-R burned 'on demand', and theoretically may last less long than a traditionally made blu.  But professional y produced/distributed BD-Rs are relatively new, and there isn't a lot of evidence yet about any lack of longevity.  I did think the quality seemed a nice if moderate step up from the DVD, although I'll admit I didn't do a side by side comparison.",1462665600,,1208,4.9950248756218905
