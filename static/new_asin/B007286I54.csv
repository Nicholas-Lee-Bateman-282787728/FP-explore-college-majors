8508761,4,B007286I54,"Love this Korean drama, I watched this movie 4 times and still like it.  I want to purchase similar movie.",1441670400,,106,4.3
8508762,5,B007286I54,"If you want to buy the magnificent Spring Waltz ONLY buy the OOP YA Entertainment DVD box set, even if you have to pay more. The YA Entertainment DVD box set is not the one on this page! It's ALWAYS worth it to get the YA Entertainment box sets instead of questionable, most likely bootleg versions of Korean dramas. As for this drama, I have watched 88 K-dramas by now and Spring Waltz remains firmly in its number 3 position on my list, after I'm Sorry, I Love You and 49 Days. Don't cheat yourself with bad versions, only get the best. These shows deserve it and you deserve it.",1406592000,2,581,4.290909090909091
8508763,5,B007286I54,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this drama. This is probably one of the best most romantic love story other than the other three seasons.

I have been searching for this drama on VCD ever since I watched it. Amazon,please put more of this drama in stock. Thank you.",1402704000,4,263,4.595744680851064
8508764,5,B007286I54,I love this drama it was a lot more involving than some of the others I have seen plus it had Siwon in it from Super Junior! Showed a lot of beautiful scenery from various places around Korea I guess and that added to the enjoyment of it. Number 1 with me right now hope I can get a copy of it with English subs!,1339286400,2,312,3.8153846153846156
8508765,1,B007286I54,"I order this DVD package [ASIN:B005VK0M20 Spring Waltz- Korean Drama (Korean with English Subtitles) 5 DVD Set] on March 27, got a order confirmation from Amazon and a shipment confirmation from the Amazon Marketplace merchant(only supplier) Kona & More on the same day. I selected free Amazon shipment and the package arrived April 2, 2012. I was completely happy so far. The supplier also included a note that told me they guarantee replacement if there is problem with any of the DVD, which is essential on media sales.

Unfortunately, when I opened the package, I found that out of the 10 different episodes of this video series, the package missed the DVD with episode#8 and duplicated the DVD with episode #9. I sent an email to the merchant and also sent a photo of the open package showing the contents. The merchant, Kona & More, replied my note promptly, understood a deadline I had for the package and offered me the US version of the same video (cost more) at no additional costs. Since the version I ordered is supposed to be the 'uncut' version that I need for a cultural program, I had to decline the generous offer. As they are out of stock now, I'll just return this, but I will not hesitate to order from Kona & More again.

This is the 2nd time I modified my review for this video version of an excellent Korean Drama series.

While waiting for the self-addressed returned envelope, I decided to watch Episode #17 of this album to see if I could catch some of the programming that was rumored to be cut from the final edition, from which the US version is rumored to be based. Big mistake! I had no idea the English subtitle quality could be so different between the US Edition(as available on Netflix now) and the Korean Edition . With the US Edition, an English speaking audience can follow the story and dialog well enough to enjoy a 4-star Drama Series. Unfortunately, the English subtitle in this Korean Edition is so bad that comprehension is impossible at times, despite the face that I have already watches the whole 20 episode of the US version. There's the word-for-word translation that is either ambiguous or makes little sense in English; the punctuation mistakes and such.

In the series, the dialog consists of about 5% German, 20% English and 75% Korean. From the dialog and the subtitle in the US Edition as shown on Netflix, we know the main characters' names are: Jae-Ha, Eun-Young, Phillip and Ina. The spelling of these names agree with the way they were pronounced, whether the actors were speaking in Korean or English. The English subtitle in this Korean version uses a spelling for these main characters' names that an English speaking audience cannot associate with their names as spoken in English. This makes it impossible to follow the dialog or story line, especially when the conversation is about secondary characters in the series. The result is that after attempting to watch 15 minutes, my wife and I had to give up on this Korean Edition and switch back to Netflix to review the first 30 minutes of Episode.

The English subtitle is crucial for an English speaking audience to understand the Korean. With the English subtitle in this Korean Edition, I couldn't follow the show.",1333411200,5,3232,4.733570159857904
