8102554,5,B000DN5VGC,"This is such a charming film about first love.  The actress does a wonderful job portraying the emotions of a rural teenager who is starstruck by her young, handsome teacher.  Be sure to look at the photos displayed with the credits at the end - a subtle and beautiful ending.  This has instantly become one of my favorite movies.",1469577600,,330,4.559322033898305
8102555,4,B000DN5VGC,"A good movie showing life, as it was in the villages, 20 years after the destruction brought by the Korean War. The movie centers in a young just-graduated teacher and his falling in love with a companion teacher, while one of his student-girls falls in love silently with the teacher. It is all very chaste and minimal, but the emotions are there, controlled and proper. Half the value of the movie is in letting you see life
in Rural Korea and when Korea was Poor. - If you are interested in Korea, you will certainly be rewarded !!",1330128000,3,534,4.459183673469388
8102556,5,B000DN5VGC,"this movie is wonderful all the way around. you need to be into small town simple storylines, bit otherwise it is great writing, incredible directing and all the actors are good. the scenery is breathtaking in the mountainous area of korea,  people who know Byun Lee from his action movie might find his dramatic and comedic flair refreshing.",1307923200,,342,4.896551724137931
8102557,5,B000DN5VGC,"Just a really great movie which succeeds in recreating the bucolic atmosphere of South Korea of fifty years ago. South Koreans let their emotions play on the surface, quick to scold, quick to befriend, quick to laughter, quick to anger, and always moving on.  This is a clever movie with a clever ending that is explained with photos while the credits roll.  I have watched hundreds of hours of South Korean cinema and this movie is one of the best.",1252627200,4,449,4.6
8102558,5,B000DN5VGC,"This is a great little film that you can likely find at your public library.  I greatly enjoyed the sights of Korea in the 60's recreated for this film and seeing how students behaved.  It would be interesting to see such things in the US, but I doubt Americans would understand the cultural value system, or find the children willing to take such schooling if you look beyond the love story at the daily life shown.  Something to remember when watching, the main character is older than her classmates because her education has been delayed to take care of her family, and it is looking back some 40+ years into the Korean countryside. Modern Western idealist will find this a confusing contrast if you missed learning about the gray areas of life and the world.  A good film if you want a debate about modern cultural views and education in a class.",1235692800,2,851,4.578947368421052
8102559,3,B000DN5VGC,"I love Do-yeon Jeon and what I love about her is that she always appears completely genuine in performance. In this film, however, her every move is riddled with acting. It's hardly her fault as she is given the mighty task of portraying a fifth-grade girl. What is that? Ten years old? Eleven? Her character could be seventeen for all I know, given the poverty and functional illiteracy of her community, but she's still a fifth-grader. All the self-conscious insecurities and pouting of a girl that age--not to mention a girl that age whose day to day life is overwhelmed by a mad crush on her new twenty-one year old school teacher--all the mannerisms are forced. But enough about that. No use crying over spilled milk, or, thank god in this case, unrequited love.

The Harmonium in My Memory is a sweet little nostalgia film set in rural South Korea sometime after the war around 1960, give or take, centering on the teachers and students at a community school. Many of the students can't afford basic school supplies, are often rowdy in class and prove to be quite a handful for the rookie teacher played wonderfully by Byung-hun Lee (A Bittersweet Life; Joint Security Area). It's the youthful idealism of Lee's character who wants to treat the students with respect and tolerance set against the older teachers' old-school values of beating and discipline that serves as the film's basic theme. The other likeable character in the film, played by Mi-yeon Lee, is another young teacher who takes her students outside to make noise and run off steam, much to the chagrin of her elders. She's Lee's love interest, and she and he share a passion for music, providing for many a musical moment in The Harmonium in My Memory. ""Don't Break The Heart That Loves You"", sung by Connie Francis, captures the torchy milieu of these characters perfectly--perhaps a little too easily.

The Harmonium in My Memory isn't a bad film, but expectations are extremely high for Do-yeon Jeon, and she disappoints; all the characters in the film are clich; the use of dramatic music seems like a shortcut to emotions the characters aren't capable of making us feel; and the ending is manipulative, tacked on to make us get happy about a film that left us empty.

And what's the deal with kids bringing stool samples to class?",1218672000,3,2309,4.7819548872180455

8102561,4,B000DN5VGC,"For those who enjoyed ""Road Home"" here comes another wonderful version of an emotional film involving teachers.
In this case the story is developing around the first love of an innocent village girl and the newly arrived teacher.
In this mixture of sad and happy moments we can enjoy the innocence and purity of a young girl who discovers love for the first time, the effort of a teacher to remain impartial and fair as a teacher towards a girl that he started liking too.
The involvement in the story of other teachers and people around their daily life, adds interest and emotion.
Soon the viewer is part of the story.
The photography is magnificent and the music typical of the 60s.
This wonderful selection of music is also a centerpiece in the development of the story.
A very well balanced film, running smoothly and keeping the viewer interested, full of emotion, throughout the entire duration.
Highly recommended.",1167350400,13,922,4.841772151898734

'The Harmonium In My Memory' is a touching, bittersweet tale of first love, exploring both the exhilarating emotional purity of initial attraction and the devastating sadness and sense of loss when things don't turn out as planned. The cinematography is amazing, showcasing some of the most vividly enchanting landscapes you'll ever see and the storyline and cast will win your heart and stay in your memory long after the closing credits.

Set in Korea circa 1963 Kang (Lee Byeong-heon) arrives in a rural village ready to begin his first teaching position. When a young local girl Yun (Jeon Do-yeon) sees Kang walking down the road her attraction to him is immediate. She shyly provides directions with a girlish giggle and the pointing of a finger. And so the flirtation begins.

Lee Byeong-heon and Jeon Do-yeon are two of the most likeable characters you'll ever watch in a film and they're just amazing together. They are so expressive you can almost feel their joy and pain as each pursues love interests that simply weren't meant to be.

This film has a little bit of everything, running the full gamit of human emotions. Just be sure to have a box of kleenex nearby, when you stop laughing you're sure to shed a tear or two. If you loved 'The Road Home' you're sure to love this too!",1148774400,28,1330,4.769565217391304
